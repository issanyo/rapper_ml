[Intro]
Good job, First
Woah, skrrt, skrrt

[Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every 20 minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (free) (God bless you)
You in a better place, dog (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Take a ride when we wake up
Hit the gas, melt your face off (Your face)
Spend the day counting cake up
With a dime who think I changed up (I changed up)
I took the Lincoln down Rodeo (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ran through it like some Drano (Ooh, ooh)
Lot of bags, can't complain though (No, no)
We was shopping until they closed
Why did I do that? Did I do that? Ooh, yeah (Uh)
New whip, now I can't pay my rent, ooh no, ooh yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every 20 minutes, change clothes (Change up)
I had a mil before the label (That money)
Just as long as they know, money made me do it (They know)
I said rest in peace to Bankroll (free) (God bless you)
You in a better place, dog (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
(Yeah, 2 Chainz)
Got a bandana 'round my neck
Like Bankroll Fresh (Free)
Pocket full of street money (Street)
'Bout to count my blessing (Street)
One hundred, one thousand
100K, one million (Uh)
We smoke, we laugh, we rap
We talked about a vision (Switch it up, haha)
I got diamonds like a rainbow, every time I change clothes
Shawty fucked my friend but I act like I ain't know
I'ma buy a raincoat, the storm might approach you
Clown like your daddy met your mom at a circus
I do it on purpose, do it for the neighborhood
Smoking on that Meagan Good, with my niggas when I do it
Got that leather and that wood, I got the marble on the floor
Got the burglar bars on the door at the bando

[Chorus: Post Malone & 2 Chainz]
Diamonds in my chain gold (Okay)
Every 20 minutes, change clothes (Change up)

You in a better place, dog (God bless you)
You won't ever see me lay low (They know it)
Start the engine, watch me take off, money made me do it (Skrrt, skrrt)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money, money, money, money)
Watch me, yeah, I said money made me do it (Money, money)
I said, yeah, I said money made me do it
