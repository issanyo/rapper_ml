[Intro: Post Malone & 24hrs]
Take you where you wanna go
Malibu or Rodeo
Take it fast or take it slow
Anything you want is yours
I love the Private Club
24hrs, and you know it's Post Malone
Don't tell nobody

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You remind me of my ex
With way more style
She the type to face the bottle
And really go wild
I've been fuckin' with the Xans
I can't even feel my face
She put her legs up high
And said, "Twenty how it taste?"
Makes it even crazier, I met her at Chase
Never been the type to try to chase
But I'll be up front
I'll be up front

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot sake when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot sake when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Baby was attracted by the gold on my tooth
I'm just so in love, I don't know what else to do
Take you out to eat, don't like sushi, but you do
Yeah, you might find a diamond ring in your miso soup
Ayy, I've been workin', baby, baby just to see you have
And you always make me smile when I say my day was cra', yeah
I'm just tryna drive and she grabbin' on my pants, yeah
Speed a hundred miles, swear to God I'm finna crash, yeah
Take you down PCH in a whip
That you ain't ever seen before
Take you down PCH in a whip
That you ain't ever seen before

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot saké when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot sake when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress

[Verse 3: 24hrs]
I wanna show you shit you've never seen
The way we fuckin', you deserve a wedding ring
We ate some shrooms, now we seein' better things
Fat Sal's with a side of onion rings
All this ice on me like it's hockey
She said she want tickets to the Roxy
She said, "Twenty I ain't on no press shit
Tell Oscar put me on the guest list"
I love it when she got an attitude
Baby girl, I ain't mad at you
Wanna take you out to Malibu
I'll be up front, I'll be up front

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot saké when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress
I wanna take you out to Malibu
Hot sake when we eat at Nobu
And baby got a smile like a
Baby got a smile like a actress

[Outro: Post Malone]
Take you where you wanna go
Malibu or Rodeo
Take it fast or take it slow
Anything you want is yours
Take you where you wanna go
Malibu or Rodeo
Take it fast or take it slow
Anything you want is yours
