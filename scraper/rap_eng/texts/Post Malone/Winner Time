[Chorus: SauceLordRich]
Sun roof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night
Sun roof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone & SauceLordRich]
I don't wanna run, run no more, this shit, no
In the winner time
These alien eyes be keepin' me high
In the winner time
In the winner time
In the winner time
I ain't never come down

[Verse: 1: SauceLordRich]
Cold enough to turn all of the haters to believers
Colder than that surgeon table when you get procedure
Colder than that street I grew up on, I'm 32 below
Colder than a New York City street night, I ain't just say no more
Cold just like Don Juan, I think I'm Don too
I'ma make you do it for everybody that's what I'ma do
Plus I'm cold like a ceiling the Vatican the roof
All my dogs, they soo cold got chinchillas by the groups
By the dozen make 'em dirty, say they colder than me
I'm soo cold, damn that's shivery, might die in my sleep
Damn near high as can be, jack frost my weed
Now I'm breakin' down the ice, cause I want slush in my lean
Wu-Tang with the 'Preme, ice cold to the ring
Like you got a cold case and I ain't sayin' a thing
Talkin' 'bout a cold case gettin' drunk in the [?]
Plus I'm colder than that karma you might bring, before then I'm a saint

[Chorus: SauceLordRich]
Sunroof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night
Sunroof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone & SauceLordRich]
I don't wanna run, run no more, this shit, no
In the winner time
These alien eyes be keepin' me high
In the winner time
In the winner time
In the winner time
I ain't never come down

[Verse 2: SauceLordRich]
Sauce yeah I'm Nicolas Cage with the actin'
Also I'm Johnny fuckin' Cage with the action
King both, A$AP Rocky with the fashion
And we gon' fuck your lady ASAP yeah I'm braggin'
I'm magic with the passes, your lady give me passes
She wanna see my show sorry, didn't get a passive
Passes on the account that she average
But she here today me and Ryan like we laughin'
Backin' know that shit get tragic
When you think you callin' I could frost you, what happened?
Cold like the cone on Gucci face
And I'm cold like Steven Seagal when he got bones to break
Got a bone to pick with rappin'
Say they really they out here doin' it
What you doin' with your rappin'?
How you captain, does everybody need it?
I know one thing with my team, I know everybody eatin' hold up

[Chorus: SauceLordRich]
Sunroof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night
Sunroof down in the winner time
I'm that cold, freeze night

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone & SauceLordRich]
I don't wanna run, run no more, this shit, no
In the winner time
These alien eyes be keepin' me high
In the winner time
In the winner time
In the winner time
I ain't never come down
