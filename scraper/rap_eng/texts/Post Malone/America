[Chorus: Post Malone]
The presidential tell me that it's money time
I'm in my number to make sure I keep my money mine
Motherfucker going crazy with the stereo
Bitch it's just another day in America
In America, in America
Bitch, it's just another day in America
In America, in America
Bitch, it's just another day in America

[Verse 1: Blake Banks]
I just touched down, LAX to JFK
Thank God for America, another day
I roll one up, then I call my bae
She blow my top, call that JFK
Bled a star, bitch, I earned my stripes
Xanax bars, Hi-Tech in my Sprite (pour up)
LA to the go, bitch, I ball like Mike
Just left the mall, now I'm fly like kite
Shipping 'round the country, but damn, getting money
Riding presidential with a Playboy bunny
Runback when I used to be bumming
Now laughed at a hater, like damn that shit is funny
Hey the day is sunny and the grass is green
I'ma get paid by any means
Made 30K just off of weed
I do what I want, that's a making-dream
It's Blake!

[Chorus: Post Malone]
The presidential tell me that it's money time
I'm in my number to make sure I keep my money mine
Motherfucker going crazy with the stereo
Bitch, it's just another day in America

[Verse 2: Saucelord Rich]
I'm stuck in my old ways
The only thing gon' kill me is that O.H
I been high fo' four days
Juice'll kill that problem, that's that O.J
The product of my father selling cocaine
Hang with me, I'll sure to hold my rope game
My main bitch, she still trapping to my O.J.'s
Smiling in your face, yeah that's the O.J.'s
Sauce on top of err'thang, she gon' earn the stripes
Leave her tail red like an airplane
Nice like this, I feel like Eddie Cane
Only difference is I'm in here draped up like Big Daddy Kane
Homie you don't hear me though
Broke bitch, what you need?
Drugs and a lil' liquor
White House probably got everything
Jewelry game, black car
Living the American dreams
Money green, weed green, lean green, same color scheme

[Chorus: Post Malone]
The presidential tell me that it's money time
I'm in my number to make sure I keep my money mine
Motherfucker going crazy with the stereo
Bitch, it's just another day in America
In America, in America
Bitch, it's just another day in America
In America, in America
Bitch, it's just another day in America
