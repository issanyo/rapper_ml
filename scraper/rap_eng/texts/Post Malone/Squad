[Intro: Post Malone]
A double cup up for my bitches who on the floor shaking they ass, whoa
Bring it on over but baby forgive me if I took the grab, oh
I'm rocking off-white with the camo, I'm spilling Ciroc on my Ablo
I'm trying to fuck with some millions, I promise won't stop 'til I have 'em

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Air Jordans to the ripped jeans
I'm in all black with my gold teeth
Put the OG in the codeine
Your bitch, she so thirsty
Said "Oh Lambo Mercy"
Fuck the police tryna search me
Smoke JUJU tryna curse me
Fuck any motherfucker tryna hurt me
Get smart, quick, unzip way too much zip
Undid zip too much zip
Man, fuck out my business
Young Post get the bills quick
Gold chains, young white Slick Rick
Boy graining my new whip
Drink 40s 'til I feel sick

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs
I got bars on bars on bars
ARs, and a bad bitch in my car
I'ma do it for my squad
I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad (look)
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad

[Verse 2: Bryce Hankins]
Look, let me start this off
Rap game got me pissed off, I'm coming to take it, there's no competition
I'm like that little sign that say I to commission
For those who don't listen, I demand detention
My new name should be shitload of issues
When we at the venue, they don't have a shot, they like unloaded pistols
And I'm countin' my money, I'm big in there honey
They call me billi' for short
Baby, my crib like we own a resort
But yo, that ain't important, what is anymore?
I got bars on bars on bars on bars on bars
And a bad bitch at my car
And she smart, and her frame, please don't get me started
Look, she don't wanna do normal shit
Tryna call me 'bout my government
And she only know the mogul for a couple minutes
But we out in public like we a couple wit' it
You ain't squad, then we ain't fuckin' wit' it
Plus, I really skate so there is a difference
If you ask me, they failed the mission
But you can come to the crib, see how we livin'

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I got drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs on drugs
I got bars on bars on bars
ARs, and a bad bitch in my car
I'ma do it for my squad
I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I'ma do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I do it for my squad
Bitch I
