[Chorus: Post Malone]
I might just steal your bitch, that's on god
I might pull up in that 6, that’s on god
All my homies off the shits, that's on god
All these bitches off the shits, that's on god
Ayy, ayy, that's on god (that's on god)
Ayy, that's on god
That’s on god, that's on god (that's on god)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I'ma score 40 something points
It doesn't matter if I'm coming off the bench
On God, on god
Melo when I'm ballin' like I'm ballin' for the motherfucking Knicks
On God, on god
We in this bitch and you know my homies flexing like a motherfucking bitch
On God, on god
I'm trying to get rich and fuck shit ain't really making anybody sit
On squad, on squad
I told him please I ain't got no time for no stuck up bitch
Sippin' on a 40 when I roll my swish
New Jordans like I'm J.R Smith
Cross Jordan hit a jumper on my A.I shit
I ain't fucking with a bitch she can pay my rent
Ray Allen like I'm Jesus that's all net
And my dad  Denzel like I'm heaven sent

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I might just steal your bitch, that's on god
I might pull up in that 6, that’s on god
All my homies off the shits, that's on god
All these bitches off the shits, that's on god
Ayy, ayy, that's on god (that's on god)
Ayy, that's on god
That’s on god, that's on god (that's on god)

[Verse 2: Bryce Hankins]
I put that on God and Jehova, on Allah
Stay 'bout my business 'cause I made a promise
If you M.I.A. then we come for your mama
I'm out in L.A. where they're chasin' them commas
If you got a problem, we'll fix it, my nigga
Hide on your roof just like Donner and Blitzen
Straight out of Texas, that wood grain we grippin'
The land of the sticky, Jemima, I'm sippin'
Oh that was your bitch? She leavin' with us
Forreally she really be feelin' me, bruh
I'm puttin' it down if you're pickin' it up
And I go for the two, one is never enough
I got my whole squad lookin' up to me now
Old bitches callin', they fuck with me now
New bitches callin', they fuck with me now
You hated me then, but you stuck with me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I might just steal your bitch, that's on god
I might pull up in that 6, that’s on god
All my homies off the shits, that's on god
All these bitches off the shits, that's on god
Ayy, ayy, that's on god (that's on god)
Ayy, that's on god
That’s on god, that's on god (that's on god)
