[Intro: Post Malone]
I’m starting to see spaceships on sunset
Aw, yeah
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
Uh
Good job, First
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Playtime’s over when the man comes around (comes around)
Shake that ass an' pick them ones off the ground (off the ground)
Eighteen carats when I open my mouth (my mouth)
They wanna fuck, I told 'em, "Jump on right now" (right now)
Ayy, when you see me, know I do not play (no play, no play that)
I keep some foreigns outside where I stay (skrrt, skrrt)
A couple million, got that call today (I got that call, brrr)
An' we in Houston, had to fuck with Trae

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(I wanna see them spaceships on sunset)
Said I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(Am I geeking, what the fuck is this?)
Hey, ahh, ohh

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Hunnid bands, make that thing turn around (turn around)
Boy, I'm geeked, I feel like Fable right now (right now)
I'm sippin' syrup, feel like Trae did right now (right now)
It's going down, it feel like Mayday right now, ayy (right now)
Money go up an' then it fall to the ground (it fall down)
Ballin' so hard, one-hunnid jumpers right now (swish)
Talk on the internet, say some shit right now (don't say that shit)
I crack that Act', then pour it all in my mouth (whoa)
I'm geeked up out my mind, I'm geeked up all the time (the time)
The type of motherfucker pay crazy shit for a line (a line)
I'm geeked up out my mind (my mind)
She geeked up off that white (that white)
Jus' like these L.A. nights, swear it's the same shit every time (every time)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Playtime’s over when the man comes around (comes around)
Shake that ass an' pick them ones off the ground (off the ground)
Eighteen carats when I open my mouth (my mouth)
They wanna fuck, I told 'em, "Jump on right now" (right now)
Ayy, when you see me, know I do not play (no play, no play that)
I keep some foreigns outside where I stay (skrrt, skrrt)
A couple million, got that call today (I got that call, brrr)
An' we in Houston, had to fuck with Trae

[Chorus: Post Malone & Trae tha Truth]
I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(Said I'm startin', said I'm startin' seeing')
Said I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
Hey, ahh, ohh, see?

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth & Post Malone]
This woman next to me is foreign, in her birthday suit
I'm talkin' clothes is missin'
I don't mind it, I'd just like to sit and view it
Let me sit with you and help you catch a vision
Human submarine, I send her lower (lower)
In the city where they say it slower (slower)
Diamonds messin' up my neck and shoulders (shoulders)
Got me arctic, feelin' like a polar (polar)
Told her trunk do stand up like a tower
For the ones who tipped they final hour
Double cup and sippin' on that Houston power
Yeah, I keep a rocket like my name was Howard
I am not alone, I got the city with me
King off in these streets, no way you can forgive me
I got money comin' faster than the wiki
It'll be that way 'til someone come and get me
Oohhh

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Playtime’s over when the man comes around (comes around)
Shake that ass an' pick them ones off the ground (off the ground)
Eighteen carats when I open my mouth (my mouth)
They wanna fuck, I told 'em, "Jump on right now" (right now)
Ayy, when you see me, know I do not play (no play, not play that)
I keep some foreigns outside where I stay (skrrt, skrrt)
A couple million, got that call today (I got that call, brrr)
An' we in Houston, had to fuck with Trae

[Chorus: Post Malone]
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
Said I’m startin' to see spaceships on sunset
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
Hey, ahh, ohh

[Outro: Post Malone]
(Oh fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Holy fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Holy fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Holy fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Holy fuck, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
(Oh my god, goddamn, I'm geeked up, yeah)
