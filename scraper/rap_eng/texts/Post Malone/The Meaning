[Intro: FKi 1st]
All this green, looking at my wrist
Like what the fuck you really mean
All this money nigga, all this green
Looking at my wrist like what the fuck you really mean
All this money nigga, all this green
Looking at my wrist like what the fuck you really mean
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean
All this money, nigga, all this green
Living that life like a fucking movie screen
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean

[Verse 1: FKi 1st]
My momma just called, she said, "Where the fuck you been?"
I said, "I ain't coming home 'til I get her a Benz"
She said, "What happened to whats-her-name?"
That ho ain't my friend
They be cool with you one day but they just fucking pretending
This is the beginning, never know no ending (no, no)
We ain't imitations, what the fuck is our ceiling?
I need my circle
Don't need the dependant (no, no)
Need to learn to read and not no fucking sense
If you talking money, then I might show off my penmanship
I can't even flex on Instagram 'cause y'all niggas love to steal my shit
But I ain't even worried, this is one of one, it's limited
Remember when you see this shit, yeah, 1st, he did this shit

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
All this money nigga, all this green
Looking at my wrist like what the fuck you really mean
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean
All this money nigga, all this green
Living that life like a fucking movie screen
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean (yeah)

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Running through the city and I got my whole team
Cup is overflowing, spilled some Faygo on my seat
Bathing Ape tee, I got Balmain on my jeans
Starting once again, don't know what the fuck it means
I don't give a fuck about no bitch, no (ayy)
I ain't ever done, I'm getting rich, ho
All I'm trying to do is stack that guala and make my mami proud
Smoking hundred dollar papers with my woe
Oh yeah
I sit on top of gold 4s, I don't need a chauffeur
Talking shit, what do you got to fucking show for? (hey)
You know I'm the one they book the show for
30 bands up front

[Chorus: FKi 1st]
All this money nigga, all this green
Looking at my wrist like what the fuck you really mean
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean
All this money nigga, all this green
Living that life like a fucking movie screen
I got a couple bitches, do they really love me?
Looking at my neck like what the fuck it really mean
