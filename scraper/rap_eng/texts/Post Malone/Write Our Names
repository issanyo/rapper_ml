[Intro: Moxie Raia]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Moxie Raia]
Maybe I don't know a thing
Maybe I know everything
Maybe the all stuff they're teaching us is wrong
Maybe if the grass was blue
Maybe if the sky was green
We could see that everything we need was here all along

[Chorus: Moxie Raia]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're making it easy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, there ain't no doubt
No money can buy this feeling
Nobody can turn us out
Calling all the renegades
All night long, all 7 days
Point the lens, we're wide awake
All around the world, we're gonna write our names
In the name of love we pray
Feelin' all the energy
Sing it, let it ricochet
All around the world, we're gonna write our names
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 2: Moxie Raia]
Maybe I don't see it right
Maybe I see all the light
Maybe all the things they're showing us are keeping us blind
Do we have to take a right?
Make it to the other side?
Sometimes, I just wonder, will we wake up 'fore we die?

[Chorus: Moxie Raia]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're makin' it easy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, there ain't no doubt
No money can buy this feeling
Nobody can turn us out
Calling all the renegades
All night long, all 7 days
Point the lens, we're wide awake
All around the world, we're gonna write our names
In the name of love we pray
Feelin' all the energy
Sing it, let it ricochet
All around the world, we're gonna write our names
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Outro: Post Malone]
What you drinkin', renegade?
Sippin' whiskey, gotta get it anyway
Keep it down and when the motherfuckin' people showin' up the way I stay
On the road, whole city just called my line
I just gotta get what's motherfuckin' mine, one life yo
Run up bands so quick, put that on my life
My life, my life
