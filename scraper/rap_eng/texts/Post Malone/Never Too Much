[Intro: Post Malone]
Stoney, Stoney

[Chorus: Blake Banks]
Money, money on my mind, I can't get enough
August so high, I can't get enough
All these drugs, I can't get enough
It's never too much, it's never too much

[Verse 1: Blake Banks]
Living life on the edge, I feel like I'm Christian
I pray to the Heavens, I hope I'm forgiven
Gotta dance to the prance, Rudolph, I'm Blitzen
I'm running this rap shit, I should win a ribbon
Before you start balling, you should work on your pivot
Before you start calling, go work on your digits
Fuck all these blogs, fuck all these critics
I feel like I'm Popeye, I'm all for that spinach

[Chorus: Blake Banks]
Money on my mind, I can't get enough
August so high, I can't get enough
All these drugs, I can't get enough
It's never too much, it's never too much
Money on my mind, I can't get enough
August so high, I can't get enough
All these drugs, I can't get enough
It's never too much, it's never too much

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
Stoney, Stoney
In a 20 footer fourter from Maroni's
Now I wanna get fed like I'm Stoney
Now your bitch wanna kick it like we homies
But she couldn't fuckin' kick it like Gotti
Had enough drugs, I been hearin' voices
Whatchu want boy, we got a lot of choices
I been riding these since 2011
So hear my fake, take the Bombay, vamanos, adios
Run it on todos Galapagos
Run in and grab the door
Rock that Martin like animals
Homies with them but no rambodo
Pass it to Blake like a lateral
Bitch, take me literal
The effort is minimal
Don't get hit with the critical
Freelicious, say you tutor, man it's dark
Swagger is biblical

[Chorus: Blake Banks]
Money on my mind, I can't get enough
August so high, I can't get enough
All these drugs, I can't get enough
It's never too much, it's never too much
Money on my mind, I can't get enough
August so high, I can't get enough
All these drugs, I can't get enough
It's never too much, it's never too much
