[Chorus]
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
You mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse]
Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats, my bezel heavy
Doors suicide, they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, "Youngin', you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie still cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy
I got cha-ayy-ayy-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ayy-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

[Chorus]
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse]
Wanna talk shit on, shit on the net
But they ain't understand they see the work I, work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with, come with the 'fits
20 years old, 20 carats, carats my heavy
Door's suicide, they say a word in, word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I, dawg I ain't it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, "Youngin', youngin' can't it"
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never, never happenin'
Ayy-ayy, ride in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin', callin' G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie's, Rollie's cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy
I got cha-ayy-ayy-ange
Why you even lookin', lookin'? Pay-ayy-in'
I'm still loyal, loyal, fuck is y'all sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain
