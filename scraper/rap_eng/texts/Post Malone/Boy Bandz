[Intro]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
So pretty lil momma come away
(Come my way, come my way, come my way)
Baby bye bye bye
Baby bye bye bye
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way
(Come my way, come my way, come my way)

[Chorus]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way
I got N'Sync dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
Pretty lil momma come my way

[Verse]
Ayy
Young motherfucker swing my gold
Everybody act like they know
Everybody want to do the most
I don't do Balmain no more
And tell that motherfucker pour more
I spill ghost blood on my coat
Might rock Moncler when I'm cold
Goddamn that's a whole 'lotta dough
Got them Backstreet Boys, ayy
Lot of chains but I swear I ain't ever change
And I might pull up in a Mercedes
With 16 gold teeth in my face
And you know if I want it, I'ma get it
And if I owe you something, I'ma pay it
If you want to say something, then say it
If you want to try the jewels, make my day

[Chorus]
I got *NSYNC dancing on my neck
And these Cubans cost a motherfucking check
Got boy bands like I'm Lance Bass
So pretty lil momma come my way
