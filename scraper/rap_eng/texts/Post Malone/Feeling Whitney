[Intro]
I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

[Chorus]
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
