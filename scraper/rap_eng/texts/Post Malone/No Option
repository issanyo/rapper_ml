[Refrain]
Ho, I look so clean and them motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but, shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everybody asking, "Post, when is the album droppin'?"
Ever since the very first day at it, I been poppin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah
Ooh, swingin' in a four-door
Now they takin' photos
Bottles, we need more of those, ooh
Say she been to every show, yeah
Even on the road
And she always be in front row, ooh yeah
Everything that I worked for
Waited so long to get on
The Caddy just sits on the chrome
I swang through on dubs on the four

[Chorus]
Baby, wanna get in this S-Class
Little mama, she just wanna go fast
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass
So I told her, "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shinin'
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Refrain]
Ho, I'm so clean and them motherfuckers just talkin'
Show up at the spot and now everyone, they all watchin'
Don't wanna prove you wrong but shit, you leave me with no option, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now she hoppin' in a old-school
Swimmin' in the carpool
Everything is all cool, ooh
Yeah, she told me not to tell
'Bout the rumors that I heard
She said, "Everything was all true", yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, wanna get in this S-Class
Little mama, she just wanna go fast
You know, baby, you don't get a free pass
So I told her, "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shinin'
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

[Bridge]
Just me and lil' mama, yeah
Ridin' around LA
Just me and lil' mama, yeah
We own the city, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, wanna get in this S-Class
Little mama, she just wanna go fast
You know baby you don't get a free pass
So I told her, "Ass, gas or grass"
Rolex with the diamonds keep me shining
Gotta have perfect timin' when I'm ridin'
Brand new Aston Martin with no mileage
Oh, oh

[Outro]
So come hop in that, ooh
What do you wanna do?
Put that dime in my coupe
With that gold on my tooth, oh, yeah
