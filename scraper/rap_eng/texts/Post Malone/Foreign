[Chorus: Jazz Lazer & Post Malone]
I been sleepin' with your bitch and you ain't even know it
Nigga, you should peep this shit
I done gave the bitch the dick and she told the world
And I ain't see you tweet the shit
Hoppin' out in Vegas, buyin' Fiji
Pour the molly in, now I'm geekin' shit
Oh Lord, they can't see the boy
'Cause the limo tint, but it's me in here
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, yeah
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign

[Verse 1: Jazz Lazer & Post Malone]
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Hoppin' out another foreign
All these bitches say you're boring
Listen to your new shit, nigga hadn't start
Loud pack is on the way up
I was raised by a pay up
Other nigga had to break a bitch
And if she outta pocket, get the paper
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
You get off early in the morning
I be in valet, I'm cool with the drivers
He see my car and he already know it
Told me you should be out any moment now
BOP, I'm gonna hold it down
Foreign fleeters, how I roll around
Turnt up, man this boy town
This bitch out in this foreign too
Broad like the roof, ass like the Coupe
Legs like the door, she a lil whore
I just might nickname her
My Aventador, skrr, like I done it before

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer & Post Malone]
I been sleepin' with your bitch and you ain't even know it
Nigga, you should peep this shit
I done gave the bitch the dick and she told the world
And I ain't see you tweet the shit
Hoppin' out in Vegas, buyin' Fiji
Pour the molly in, now I'm geekin' shit
Oh Lord, they can't see the boy
'Cause the limo tint, but it's me in here
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, yeah
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign

[Verse 2: Jazz Lazer]
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Fuckin' on a nigga main ho
I don't ever shoot the Addy too
You can take a Uber when you go
Perc's got a nigga low
I need a Xanny for sure
Roll it, roll it, roll it smoke it up 'til you choke
L.A. bitches and they all off the coke
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
White Ferarri Californian
Jamaican nigga pull up on you
Got some shooters with me, I should warn you
She feel Filipino on Italian
Oh I love eatin' Italian
I got adjust or you wildin'
I got the key like I'm Khaled
Trust me, you play so
The Maybach is swingin' it's so
We all know you dropped a new album
The chemist have things on a shelf
I came with some gas on myself and a whole thing
Molly whiter than the cocaine
Chipotle for my holy
Diamonds on my chain, call it Coldplay, oh man

[Chorus: Jazz Lazer & Post Malone]
I been sleepin' with your bitch and you ain't even know it
Nigga, you should peep this shit
I done gave the bitch the dick and she told the world
And I ain't see you tweet the shit
Hoppin' out in Vegas, buyin' Fiji
Pour the molly in, now I'm geekin' shit
Oh Lord, they can't see the boy
'Cause the limo tint, but it's me in here
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, yeah
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign
Foreign, foreign, foreign, foreign

[Outro: Post Malone]
You know I done told you, you know I done told you
You know I done told you, you know I done told you
You know I done told you, you know I done told you
You know I done told you, you know I done told you
You know I done told you, you know I done told you
