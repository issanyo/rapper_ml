[Intro]
I know, I know
I know, I know
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Verse 1]
Run it up, run it up
Count it up, count it up
'95 in my cup
Nicotine in my blood
Go, run it, run it
Count it, count it
Go, show me something, ayy, ayy
Go, talkin' that shit
Keep on barkin' lil' bitch
Bitches tryna get lit, damn
Rosé poppin' with the Balmain on me
And I keep on callin'
And they know that I don't answer my cell
No, I don't know your momma
I got so much commas
Girl, you know I'm only into myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch my life
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, give this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you flexin', that's a big lie

[Verse 2]
Ooh, valet the park on the whip
The Caddy, the '76
My woman gon' box on a bitch
They don't want no part in that shit
I got my money jumpin', I'm proud for ballin' on Fade
Didn’t watch the game, you can see that shit on replay
I just drop the top and I pull up to your party
I just grab a Bud and I pop the top on you, pour that water

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
When I pull up, get this bitch live
And you know that I'ma get mine, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Say you flexin', that's a big lie
Say you got that shit you don't got
Heard you say that shit a hundred times, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And I know who we are, yeah
And I know that we ballin'
When you wanna get this money
I don't want your bitch, just know it

[Outro]
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
