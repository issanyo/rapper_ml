[Verse 1]
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason that I’m traveling on
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 2]
Well, it ain't no use in turning off your light, babe
The one that I never knowed
Well, it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Well, I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 3]
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you've never done before
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
I can’t hear you anymore
Well, I’m thinking and wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Verse 4]
Well, so long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I cannot tell
Well, goodbye's too good a word, babe
So, I’ll just say fare thee well
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better but, hey, I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

[Outro]
But, don't think twice, that's all right
Well, don't think twice, that's all right
