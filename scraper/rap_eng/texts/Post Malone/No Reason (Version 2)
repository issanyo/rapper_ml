[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
And you talkin' that shit for no reason (and you talkin' that shit)
When you know you comin' home this evenin' (when you know you comin' home)
Why you wanna come and play with my emotions?
When you know you should be going through the motions
We don't got no time to waste, whoa-oa-oa
This is not the time or place, oh-oh-ohhh
This the shit that make you wanna wow (wow, wow)
And I really think I'm on that king shit
Make you wanna bow down (bow down)
Ooh, I'm feelin' like I lost it now
Got me runnin' like a faucet now
Tell 'em there's a new boss in town
Girl, I'm feelin' like I'm lost and found
'Cause I'm so up and down
'Cause I'm so up and down
So up and down

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Got a tan line, I wear my fuckin' Rollie so much
Lil' bitch, you think you somethin', but I find you in the gutter
Kinda want it, bought it with the money, oh look
Which girl you don't fuck, I'm gonna tell you how to fuck her

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Count a hunnid bands, watch it swerve on the street
Count a hunnid bands, will I know? No, not me
Count a hunnid bands, watch it swerve on the street

[Outro: Post Malone]
Hey, ohh-ohh, oh, yeah

We done came up, don't matter to me
You the same one that doubted me
