[Intro: Fki 1st]
Hahaha
Turn up
Turn up
Yeah
Hahaha

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Tell my dudes, "Bring the bottles to the crib"
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I just poured me up a cup
(I just poured me up a cup)
Call the plug and see what's up
(Call my plug and see what's up)
Ayy, I just poured me up a cup
(I just poured me up a cup)
Lemme show these haters up
(Lemme show these haters up)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Put the damn lean in the rocka
Pull up to the scene b-b-baka
Balmain, whole screen light the block up
Lookin' damn clean with the shopper
Screaming "Wu-tang Queen", I'm a shopper
They see us lookin' evil with the hover
Pull up, ski-mask, balaclava
Damn, let me do the honors (honors)
Sign my name over by the commas
Hit the dash, spend a grand at Benihana's (got me faded, oh my God)
Everything designer
Margiela got me lookin' like I'm walkin' on some water (oh shit)
Drop the top on the whip for the summer
Just finished this bottle, think I'm 'bout to pop another
Tell the waitress, "Keep 'em comin'" (damn right)
We always turnt up, ho, it's nothing
And tell my old bitch "don't worry who I'm fuckin'" (uh)
Keep the 'rari engine running, hit the gas and I fuckin' blast past
Spillin' champagne out the damn glass
Bitch, I'm stuck (bitch, I'm stuck)
And I'm livin' out in Cali now (bitch)
And, bitch, my life is lavish now (turn up)
Blowin' money and I'm laughin' now (laughin')
Rodeo, drive a 424, I'm cashin' out

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Tell my dudes, "Bring the bottles to the crib"
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I just poured me up a cup
(I just poured me up a cup)
Call the plug and see what's up
(Call my plug and see what's up)
Ayy, I just poured me up a cup
(I just poured me up a cup)
Lemme show these haters up
(Lemme show these haters up)

[Verse 2: Sauce Lord Rich & Fki 1st]
I got four seats, talkin' four freaks, goin' balls-deep
Think about it, fuckin' 'em in a fisher, I'ma foresee
Ho, please, saucin' 'til I'm forty like I'm OE
Hood name hot too, [?] name [?]
Source Jefé, [?] like an esé
Known to get a little from my side like a temp fade
I be in the A like a wrote a good essay
And add a little L to it when I do my West thing
She be takin' shots, no Goldie
In the spur of the moment like Ginobili
Hit her with the Chris Paul, pass her to my homie
Keep it a hunnid, told me I done it
Told me to run it, drinkin' for nothing
Screamin' out, "Fuck it", we'll make her buss it
Turnin' up 'til it's over (ayy)
We done ball, hold up, hold up

[Verse 3: Fki 1st]
I been runnin' round that bit, ho, fuckin' with a thick chick
Runnin' round this mo'fucker, tryna get my dick licked
I'm coolin' with so many bitches, I'm feelin' [?], I'm on my ting shit
I got 'em dirty dancin' in my mansion and my team lit
Niggas poppin' bottle after bottle champagne-poppin'
They can't stop it so they clappin', yeah, things poppin'
Yeah, we popular, go check my fan-page

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Tell my dudes, "Bring the bottles to the crib"
Call them hoes, bring them models to the crib
We turnin' up, it's full throttle in this bitch
'Fuck is up with all these haters talkin' shit?
(Now hol' up, hahaha, tell my)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I just poured me up a cup (sell my, turn up)
Call the plug and see what's up (call my, turn up)
Ayy, I just poured me up a cup
Lemme show these haters up
