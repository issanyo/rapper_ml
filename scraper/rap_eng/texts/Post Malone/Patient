[Chorus]
Yeah, I know my wrist be dancin' crazy (Crazy)
Been on some fly shit lately (Lately)
Used to be so damn patient (Patient)
But now it's "Fuck you, pay me" (Pay me)
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me (Phase me)
Never let that money change me (Change me)
Ain't the way my momma raised me (Raised me)
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Two hundred K and VVS, yellow diamonds (Skrrt, skrrt)
They wanna run up but they won't never find me (No way)
Sleep right next to the F&N
Motherfuckers the government
