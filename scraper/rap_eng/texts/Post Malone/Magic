[Chorus]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic
Magic
Magic, Alakazam
Magic
Magic, well I, Alakazam

[Verse]
32 ounces on me like I'm Magic, ahh
Magic Johnson 3, I ain't playin' basketball
And we got some molly, magic potion, alcohol
I'm with Aphrodite, drinkin' nectar of the gods
Wakin' up to some Swishers and some liquor
Fuck 'em or fuck her, whatever get me faded quicker
She grind on my zipper 'cause I'm a big tipper
She stay in L.A. like she play for the Clippers
You see what we whippin', whole crew is shittin' on mothafuckas
Can't stand the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
I got that Houdini, disappear her bikini
She rub on my lamp, damn I feel like a genie
On my magic carpet, I'm poppin' a wheelie
So fresh, you can't see me, I do this routinely
I don't do no freebies, you feel me?
I need me a couple bands
They appear in my fuckin' hands

[Chorus]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic
Stony, magic
Magic, Alakazam
Magic
Magic, well I, Alakazam
