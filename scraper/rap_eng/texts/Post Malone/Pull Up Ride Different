[Intro]
Hahaha
(Stoney Maloney)

[Verse 1]
Young-Young Stoney, swangin', sippin' Remy
I just had some Henney, not the semi
Cocaine from the raft to the levies
Skate highs, bitch, Versace or the Givenchy
Only choice if we're swangin' in the Chevy (skrrt)
Young Stoney, fuck the bitch, she in the Bentley
Bandana on me, bumpin' Makaveli
Stonin', I just pour four up in the twenty (what?)
These bitches barkin' at the kennel
Had to swap bitches like a rental (yeah)
Kiss a elevator, bitch's levels
Snap a cannon with a Canon, no rebel
Gold-diggers couldn't dig it with a shovel (hell no)
In the Continental feelin' presidential (hell no)
Blowin' gas when I'm pushin' on the pedal
Bitch, Oriental headbanging like it's metal, she gon' get sentimental

[Chorus]
Pull up in the hoodie 'cause y'all motherfuckers need dealers (skrrt)
I only fuck with squad, y'all motherfuckers gettin' no features (hell no)
And I just bust a semi and I'm all out of money on my Visa (out of money on my Visa)
But no limit on the black card (hahaha)
I got it, you see me on the [?]
I just came up, I ain't never coming down
Every time we pullin' up, we gon' shut this shit down
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different, bitch, I ride different

[Verse 2]
I got some money comin', throw it in the counters
Me and the homie blowin' money like it's nothing (pap, pap)
Couple aces in my hand, I ain't bluffin'
Top shelf, and the blunt steady puffin' (steady puffin')
Said oh, damn (damn)
So that's how it's gonna be, huh? (huh?)
When I had nothin', ain't nobody give a shit
Now I got it, wanna fuck with me, huh? (huh?)
Man, fuck off with that bullshit
Dab riggin' that toolkit (woo)
Hoes used to curve like there was new shit
Now the same hoes in a full-split
Four overloads, I'm cool, shit (damn)
Got gold all in my jewel, shit (yeah)
Got bad hoes in my pool, shit
Trips to Am-Dam, that's zoo-shit (woo)

[Chorus]
Pull up in the hoodie 'cause y'all motherfuckers need dealers (skrrt)
I only fuck with squad, y'all motherfuckers gettin' no features (hell no)
And I just bust a semi and I'm all out of money on my Visa (out of money on my Visa)
But no limit on the black card (hahaha)
I got it, you see me on the [?]
I just came up, I ain't never coming down
Every time we pullin' up, we gon' shut this shit down
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different, bitch, I ride different

[Outro]
Bitch, I ride different
And I ride different, I ride different
My roof missing, I ride different
And I ride different, I stay sippin', my roof missing, that loud twistin'
I ride different
