[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
I been gettin' this, see like then like my neck was killin'
Grow a sumo on my face, call me flockaveli
Nigga what's the dealy, Lemme know what's brackin'
Ain't no flamer's round here, nigga stop that actin'
Bitch I'm 'bout that action, so drink 'em like a fraction
Everybody packin, like nick minaj ass
Kush smell like garbage, nigga pay some homage
Then got a hood, now that bitch call me finest
Mizay made as mess shit that my mother
Yella diamonds fuzzy chain shit that bitch like butta
Bitch I'm like no otha', rap nigga
You can call me good, broke-ass strap nigga

[Chorus]
KY Engineerin', fuzzy got 'em steerin'
Fuzzy diamond earin's, M6 what I'm steerin's
Woke up to next year in, re-rack diamond earin's
That some John Dearin, nigga who you scarin'
Shawty I'm tatted up, you can call me inky
All I do is get brains, you can call me pinkie
My gooch is like winky, right nigga
I got my swag up, right nigga
I heard they got a price tag on a nigga head
You got a better chance snitchin', nigga goin feds
You dug your own grave, let me make yo' jail bed
Suicide shawty shot his own self red
RIVERDALE!
