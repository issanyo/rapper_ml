[Intro]

Man I'm selfish, i ain't sharing my bitches with no one

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]

Im too selfish for a threesome, ( WAKA FLOCKA) Girl I want you to myself
Took that pussy off the shelf, now she tryin to be my BM
It go down in my dm’s , she an Instagram hoe so that’s exactly how I treat her
Girl, you fucking with a savage, see my neck and wrist froze she just wanna live lavish
I just wanna play madden, kick it with the homies girl gone with that naggin
And my snapchat bragging, got a 100 hoes in it like “flock when we smashin.”
I just start laughin, tammy figured out my password and she start spazzin
Then I stop laughin, shit just got realer than a nigga could imagine
So I bought her a new mansion, 40 pointers in the rolly face diamonds dancing
I think she love me cause im handsome, she said after this she ain't gon  give me no more chances
It just went down cause my down dm, it went down cause my dm
It went down, it went down cause my dm’s
It went, it went down cause my dm’s

[Outro ]
Damn! Man these smalls hoes always gon try to fuck something up man for real
You gotta be a real nigga man skip a hoe, you know
