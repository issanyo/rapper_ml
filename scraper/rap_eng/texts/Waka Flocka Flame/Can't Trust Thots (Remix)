[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm a mahfucking player better know that
Got a white girl asking where Flocka at
Black girls want to take shots with me
Fuck you thought you ain't hustle on the block with me
Thot, that ho over there
And if we playing poker that I got two pairs
But I be so aware that these hoes ain't shit
I'm so prepared you can't run game bitch

[Hook: Wash]
Can't trust thots
Soon as them bottles start coming out (thots)
Then she come running to my car (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile
And you can't trust thots
Soon as the liquor start running out (thots)
She'll be creeping to another couch (thots)
She'll leave your ass never trust a big butt and a smile

[Verse 2: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for bottles as soon as she come in the club
You can find her at my table flirting with the ballers tryna go for a cup
Crazy part shorty bad as fuck
Doing squats all day working on her butt
She know that I'll make a nigga go nuts
That's what she want

[Bridge: Wash]
She ain't tryna pay for anything if anything
She tryna get a wedding ring
But me and my niggas ain't no cuffing no nothing
And her favorite thing to hear a dude say is
You might get a pair of nice shoes and a bag
Money ain't nothing baby I'll spend it fast on you
Baby I'll spend it fast on you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wash]
A thot is a girl that look for sparkle as soon as she come in the club
You can spot her up at the bar until she see them lights
Then she coming on over here with us
Ain't no shame in her game
She bring her friends too and
They be tryna act like they not with her but they be drinking too

[Bridge] +[Hook]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
You know you can't trust them T-H, O-T-S
No [?] cause them thots be on BS
Riding down Collens in my Aston
I ain't trying to check my dms stop asking
Hope you understands its no feelings just smashing
Me and Wash can't trust thots so we pass them
All that flexing for them Instagram followers you ain't balling
Just an Instagram ma that's why I can't

[Hook]
