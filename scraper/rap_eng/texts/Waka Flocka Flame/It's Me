Shawty just right, call her Light Brite
She's super thick and that hoe could suck a dick
And I'm hoodrich, so you know she's straight
I get so much guap, I get so much cake
Fuck the cops and fuck the judge
Waka Flocka Flame, he a fucking thug
Volume two, yeah, [?] bad
This a Southside track, paid five stacks flat
Shop a lot, smoke a lot
Trap a little 'cause I'm rapping now
I get [?], nigga, how that sound?
My first mixtape, I won 50-play
Down south gutter music, this the fucking movement
Red and blue boys, black and gold boys
Throw your set up, nigga, bang for life
Keeps this shit a hundred, So Icey fucking run it
I'm in no man's land, wish I can [?] for you
What's up, OGs? Big Bentley B's
What's up [?] with Mazaradi Fox
Every day, this shit, I'll burn a cop
Flocka
