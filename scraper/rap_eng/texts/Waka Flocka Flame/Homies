[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
A long ride to the west
M.O.B. tatted on my chest
Lord, please don't let me rest
Why these niggas wanna stress?
Dear God, please give me strength
One time, I don't got friends

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it

[Verse 1: YG Hootie]
Hopped back, show you my pop game
Make a warfare, that's my mind frame
Booty gon' go high octane
Flock on the west like Pac came
I'm from the hood, it's a shit pot
Don't know the right niggas, you're gonna get got
I go hard, know they wanna kill me, but I got these G'd up [?]
Fuck a schoolgirl, want a ratchet
Sherm stick smoke like acid
Hit that shit one time, now the boy straight gone
These folks, we got the throne, we known to get it on
Respect to the [?], doing it the G way till God take me home
My turf got me on

[Verse 2: P Smurf]
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my chain
I'ma be fighting murder like Gucci Mane
Big rocks in the pinky, red and white
They all around my ring like a Tyson fight
You know I fuck they eyes up when I hit the block
Red drop of [?] like chicken pox
Big biscuit, I'll give your ass a one-piece special
And leave the club with twelve bitches, I must be special
We're smoking out like [?] the [?]
Fuck a bodyguard, I'll be somebody's ass
Chain on [?], all rocky
Put that ring on and I'll feel like Rocky
P Smurf, I gets my chips
Scratched up like a CD that skips
My beat down low, I feel like Tip
Lucky Charms on my chain, your bitch a little flip

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it

[Verse 3: Ice Burgandy]
I mean what I say, I say what I mean
I bleed what I bang, I bang what I bleed
Inglewood A, V to the E
700 block, NHP
The [?] ain't Bloods in the LPB
Trigger fingers and thumbs just like me
The ATM Elm Streey smell like beef
We'll take your brick squad, nigga, so icy
Diamond Enterprise in a realm full of [?]
Doing the speed limit, trying to get on the five
Real nigga spitting, you can see it in my eyes
Tattoo tears mean a nigga done died
My nigga's brain fried, going gang ties
That's where I'm from, guaranteed to bang mine
Throw me in the county jail, walk the main line
I'll bang mines till the day I die

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Can't talk to no bitches, don't approach me
Can't no nigga run me
Ain't no nigga coaching me
What, you Phil Jackson?
Got dreadhead killers like Haitian Jack
They so active
Ready to let them burners clap
And I'ma lie back and chill, all I chase is stacks
All I know is mug and grill
All I know is hug the steel
These damn white guys got a young nigga flexing
Popping at the mouth, I'ma teach your ass a lesson
I thumped his ass out like the A-Town Braves
Foaming out the mouth like a Alka-Seltzer
These hands can't do it like the [?]
Shawty, I'm so P-funk

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it
Shawty, this how we rocking
Red flags out our pockets
Tear drops on my partner face
Murder one, shawty, we beat the case
Bullshit, ain't got time for it
Couple mil, on our grind for it
Homeboys, we gone ride for it
What I say out my mouth, I'ma die for it
