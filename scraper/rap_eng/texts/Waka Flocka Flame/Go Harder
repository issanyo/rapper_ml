[Hook: Wayne Marshall]
From you say hard we go harder
This a the next episode in the saga
300 foot yacht pon the harbour
Private jet, it's Airbus 380 we order
From you say hard we go harder
This a the next episode in the saga
All me son pampers them a Prada
I'ma go harder
Me say I'ma go harder

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
I say now I'ma go hard, 20 model broads
Need a passport, all these foreigns in my garage
I be shittin on these niggas, stuntin on these hoes
Rollie full of diamonds and neck is covered in gold
Say who want it with that boy? Pussy rappers would avoid
Bitch I’m married to the game, ain’t no way I get divorced
See I’m swimming in the money, talking Michael Phelps nigga
Going hard every day, lookin at a go getter
I'm the realest in this shit, all my bitches super thick
Got em flashin in the club, ain’t nobody take a pic
I'm going hard, getting higher than the bitch
Talkin 20 bottles in, me a beat you in the VIP
Gone

[Verse 2: Cham]
Ye man, we on this and we mean
Travel in a team
Married to the O’s still cuz I love my money green
And us will never stop, we all messin on the scheme
I made my first millie from the age of 17
So all homies are fi clean, that on me dream
Product have to get here under brand new regime
Driving Lamborghinis and I play good stream
Rising to the top, we on a cup, we have the cream
Thought it was a fraud, importin the fi yad
But mama have to eat so I was forced to hustle hard
No more flushin credit card, a pitbull through the yard
Have police in my back What you mean, my money broad

[Pre-Hook: Wayne Marshall]

[Verse 3: Wake Flocka Flame]
Girl back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up
Dirty wind for me girl, start actin up
Dirty wind for me girl, start actin up
You got the pockets in yo jeans, ass fat as fuck
Shot shot shot shot til you had enough
Shot shot shot shot til the party drunk
Waka Flocka in this bitch so the party crunk
Throwin money in this bitch, Blowin bridge Truck?
Blood diamonds on my neck and my watch
When I pull up Phantom Ghost they gon watch
To the club, boy me and Wayne Marshall
Every time you cross the US border dog I got you
