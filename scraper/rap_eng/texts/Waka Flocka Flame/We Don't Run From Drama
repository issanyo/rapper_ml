[Hook: Bo Deal]
When you see me out, you know I'm decent
I'm strapped and every police know me in the precinct
But if a nigga out of line, I leave him leakin'
Clap him, leave him for the preacher and the deacon
We don't run from drama cause we bring it
We don't run from drama cause we bring it
We don't run from drama cause we bring it
When it's war, you know that Desert Eagle screamin'

[Verse 1: P.Rico]
We don't run from drama cause we bring it
You know I'm Team No Lackin' so I'm decent
Smokin' on this dopey dope, I'm chiefin'
I be blowin' money for no reason
Servin' all the fiends cause they need it
With some bad bitches and they divas
Thotianas brainin' me, they teethin'
Pour up the hard shit, you know I'm leanin'
Choppers make noise, them bitches screamin'
Ambulance came, no one was breathin'
A lot of DOAs, my niggas demons
And if I ain't whack him, thank Jesus!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bo Deal]
We don't run from drama cause we bring it
When it's on I'll kill yo' ass, my niggas fiendin'
Hit a nigga with that left and leave him dreamin'
With the pistol and the glove, so I'm a demon
I rob niggas, I take shit
These rappers be on that fake shit
Talk behind your back but smilin' all up in your face shit, nigga, yeah
When I'm around I bet he won't say shit
When that K spit, it's night night, send your ass on a vacation
Big boss, Bo Deal, Killa Klan my team, nigga
Bricksquad my team, nigga
40 come with that beam, nigga
Yeah
I don't miss, I shoot like a free throw
My aim sick, just lethal
I'm fuckin' with my nigga Rico

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
All these niggas want drama, shit I'm all about that
Where the fuck he at? Playin' with them sticks, bitch I'm all about that
Shootouts at the club, bitch I'm all about that
Speak my name, better watch your back
When the right crew pull up, k-k-k, where the fuck you at
They think we won't pull up like that, so boom
Jump out yo' skin
Can't find you, we gon' kill your friend and your closest kin, no actin'
Just action, them full automatics we packin', you a dead man
In my hood, you a wanted man (Riverdale!)
Turn your fitted cap into a headband
No Method Man, I'll leave you red, man
BSM the new Taliban
I keep a cannon like a cameraman
Major league, shout out Pacman
Thirty deep, shout out Killa Klan
We want the drama, told Bo D "call Mecca"
(Ay, Bo!) That's his shoota man
When Bo D call Mecca (Ay, Bo!)
He start shootin', man
