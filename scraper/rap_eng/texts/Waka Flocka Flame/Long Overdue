[Hook: Frenchie & Waka Flocka Flame]
Long overdue
I deserve this Rollie, Coupe with the missing roof
L.O.D. long overdue
I should have bought the Bently 4-door and the Coupe
L.O.D., long overdue
I could hit your 'hood, make your block yell "Woo!"
L.O.D., long overdue
And my city red, make them scream "Su woo!"

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
I got that hook up, watch me cook up, Master P, I'm 'bout it ('bout it)
You should know I'm all about it, rob you for your cook up
My block got you shook up, you don't know my name, bitch?
Look inside a dictionary, "Frenchie" you should look up
I got war wounds and my tattoos, better duck when I pass you
I'll put you in a bag, back burner, going nuts, no cashews
I'm the man, did I ask you? I'm fully loaded, my MAC, too
Any nigga, I bet it move
My time is now, long overdue

[Hook: Frenchie & Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn a 1 to a 2, cooking like a chef
Called his ass a pussy as he took his last breath
As he took his last step, E.L.M. is what I rep
I'm a Riverdale nigga, you can place your fucking order
I don't have to cross the border, it's already out in Georgia
Getting kush for 2,000
Stay money counting, switching cars, call it fashion
Banging for the passion, up 6 million, what's happening?
