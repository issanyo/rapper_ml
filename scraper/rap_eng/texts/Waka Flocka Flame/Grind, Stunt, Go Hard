Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart
Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart

[Verse 1]
Trap house in the name of my dick game
Her boyfriend is a lame, so me and him is not the same
Right leg shaking, late night drinking
Her blunt smoking so we bedroom fucking
Me and Slim Dunkin fucking back to back, dog
Dick got her AWOL, the girls like Flocka
Hoes like Waka, I gotta fuck that nogger
Iced out green shit, infrared beams, bitch
Clique super deep, nigga
Bricksquad street nigga
H.S.T. killers, get the white sheet, nigga
Labels keep calling 'cause I'm going hard and balling
Swag bathroom stalling, Flocka Flame, he the shit
I grind, I stunt, I go hard
365, I'ma go hard
Twelve month run, I'ma go hard
I never crossed over, this ain't b-ball

[Hook]
Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart
Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart

[Verse 2]
Me and Slim Dunkin bust some pounds like pumpkins
Fighting in the club, after that, I'm straight dumping
Real shit, real talk, Waka Flocka don't talk
White chalk, white sheets, that boy finna go to sleep
To the next world, how 'bout by Jesus Christ, nigga?
My charm overkill, so I gave my bird a record deal
Hoes, man, I kill and [?]
Me and Joey rolling, man
Big group in that stolen van
That bitch like a ceiling fan
Fold yo' ass like coffee, nigga
Twelve on the corner, they stalking, nigga
Hawking, nigga, so watch out
Run with the work, you found out
Tell Big Gucci I'ma wet they ass like coochie
And tell D.A. tell them hoes to keep [?]
Young Juice right-hand cooking, Wooh straight flexing
Frenchie always fucking, Yung Joey home, nigga
So we stunting, balling and we going hard, nigga
LeBron Flocka James, I'm going hard, nigga

[Hook]
Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart
Grind, stunt, go hard
Monday through Sunday, I'ma go hard
Burnt a couple of niggas, that's my street [?]
Raised by his squad so I'm street smart

[Outro]
I'm riding, I'm swerving

Hit me up, nigga
