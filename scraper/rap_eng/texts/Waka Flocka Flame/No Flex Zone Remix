No flex, zone
No flex, zone
They know betta

[Verse 1]
Young rappers, keep cash in ya pocket
It's a tip go an' buy you a wallet
Pussy cards in the in the pot to get profit
Look at Waka flocka, try an' get some knowledge
Fuck that nigga let's get ignant
You niggas ain't ballin', you just feelin' on ya pivot
Y'all chase bitches for the digits
I chase riches for the digits, let's get it
Y'all can't see my plan
These bitches wanna kick it, Mia Hamm
I'm with Steve Aoki, you at Benihana's
Spending all this money on ya baby mommas
No flex on, imma get my flex on
If you trynna turn up in the club, I got the best on
Trend setter so I know they gon' follow
Jay said he dummed down and doubled his dollars
I was popping pistols, y'all was poppin' collars
Dropped a hit record, now the labels gon' call us
Rockstar wid a big ass gun
An' I do it for myself cause that's how shit gets done
Obedience is key, that's how your bitch is gon' come
Big crib, big whip, big blunt
Real shit in ya eardrums
If you talking bout a man on Earth I don't feel one

[Interlude]
Fuck you mean, man
No flex zone pussy nigga
Can't rap volume 2, man
Y'all niggas mad cause I hang around with niggas you can't hang around with (facts!)
I don't want no industry friend
Fuck you rap niggas I don't want no instagram pictures pussy nigga
Straight up, man

[Verse 2]
Real one and I been through some real shit
If ya actin weird, then I'm lettin' off a full clip
Hell yeah Waka Flocka with the bullshit
They know I got cream when I pull up in the cool whip
And the rule in the buildin' say I gotta be cool with all the people that I went to school with
I got some new kush, I got some new guns
I cause a tidal wave, I'm bout to cause a new one

[Interlude]
I was joggin’ on you niggas, they callin’ this shit the new one
And we still bustin’ when the news come, pussy nigga
Don’t got me back on this fuck shit, man
I neva left that fuck shit, man
Streets dust, man, squad!
