[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Big homie! Squad!

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad

[Verse 1: Loudiene & Waka Flocka Flame]
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Shots fired, he was movin' fast
Too many shots left him down bad (grrrr-ah!)
I'm a demon with a [?]
Bodybags and toetags
Rob a nigga with no mask
All gas, no brake pads
Shit, shit
[?] in a hospital
I put a nigga in a hospital
Thirty clip just to drop niggas
[?] come and mop niggas
Clip longer than a popsicle
I pull it out, tell 'em "freeze!"
Hit 'em everywhere but his knees
Put your hands up, nigga, freeze
Poppin' Mollies like Aleve
Plug came from overseas
Cocaine from Belize
[?] on a Benz, Pimp C
All my niggas throwin' B
[?]
4-5 with the red beams
Cook a nigga like some red beans
Murder scene, murder scene

[Verse 2: J-Dubb & Waka Flocka Flame]
You know it's real, I say it's on blood
Shoot the club up like I'm J-Dubb
Pinky ring like a lightbulb
Know these niggas ain't no damn thugs
Waka Flocka, that's my fuckin' brother
Shoot your mother and your baby mother
Can't trust these niggas, police undercover
Lethal weapon on me, Danny Glover
Prison gates in the tour dates
Free all my niggas that's upstate
Breadwinner, bitch Free Gates
Popped a nigga for a lunch plate
Robbed a rapper 'cause I know he fake
Need a house with a fuckin' lake
Model bitch but her body fake

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
Robbed a nigga, caught him down bad
