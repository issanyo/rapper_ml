[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma fuck her, not gon' lick her, I'ma beat her back out
You gon' cake, you gon' date, you gon' let your guard down
You a lame, I'm a boss, that's what these girls like
From L.A. to New York, I'ma give these girls Hell
I'ma fuck her, not gon' lick her, I'ma beat her back out
You gon' cake, you gon' date, you gon' let your guard down
You a lame, I'm a boss, that's what these girls like

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
You gon' tell her that you love her, I'ma treat her for my night
I'ma freaky nigga, might lick a bitch down
Nope, in the six wit more dro, blowing kush down
Things are good in thie hood, I'm busting bricks down
AK-47 for them boys trying to play around
I like my booty round, all my hoes love to bounce
Shawty, you a fool with it
Shawty, you a fool with it
Stop

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma fuck her, not gon' lick her, I'ma beat her back out

[Verse 2: Wooh da Kid]
Face down, ass up, won't make love in the mouth
I'ma beat her like she stole my last blunt in the drought
Wooh da Kid fucked your main and your sister
Her mouth's a playground, so I never kissed her
Too many kids played around in her playground
Call this girl Mary J. 'cause she going down
You spend your money, breaking bread with a freak bitch
Don't give her shit but some rubber and a dope dick

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma fuck her, not gon' lick her, I'ma beat her back out
