Im in the studio
They call me dope
Baby take a whiff of me come get hooked
Man they call my vocals coke
I told my fans to sniff
Who want a hit of this
And mystikal is ecstasy
I bet a rap nigga won't stand next to me
Im lookin to my left and right, what i see?
These niggas under me
Feeling like my mini mes

Its so hard to see em gone
Drunk as hell of that white remy martin
Realest rapper doing it
Real niggas influenced it
In the crowd with my fans that folk love
Throw your hood up at my concert call it thug love
You dont like me you get no love
I think I might die Im on so much drugs
