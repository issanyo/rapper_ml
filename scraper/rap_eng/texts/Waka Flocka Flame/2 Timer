[Hook: YG Hootie]
I done lost to many real ones, I can't lose no more
Look out for my dawg, blow some on a ho
Got my paper right, and my life straight
Counting cash up, this is my cake
Throw it, throw it, bitch I'm finna' blow it
Throw it, throw it, bitch I'm finna' blow it
Get your money mama, I'm a deuce liner
She mad at me, she say I'm a two timer

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
Money everywhere, bad bitches everywhere
Real niggas everywhere, bottles everywhere
Money imma' throw it, throw it
Twenty cake, tonight blow it, blow it, fuck yeah
Bricksquad Monopoly a click full of real niggas
My chain cost one hundred on the real nigga
I'm rolling off two pills nigga, for real nigga
If you riding in a G, we down to kill nigga
Tonight's a motion picture, baby girl what're you trying to do tonight, let me know
Would these bands make this bitch dyke
Money imma' blow it, throw it

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
Hit the girl one time, never called her
If my girl asked me about you, never saw you
Mixing lean with patron, turnt' up- a holic
I say I'm living life cheap, so what you call it
Hundred bottles in the club, T.U
And my whole squad funky, P.U
And I know little mama wear that rocking see threw
She want to function with the squad on them see threws
Sizzle Lean on the track, hundred racks
How you get your money back, hundred packs
C.A. to G.A., that's a tax
Don't even call my phone, just send a text

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eldorado Red]
I feel like a chopper, I feel like a chopper
With all these bricks, I'm the king I'm ?
Fifty racks in the club, bitches yelling out bravo
It's the king of the crest, the kid Eldorado, yeah
P.G.M., Bricksquad Monopoly
We popping B
Rozay, Clayco
Bad bitches, I keep those
V.I.P., get high with me
G5, mommy come fly with me
I'm in the club, playing with the TEC
Me, Waka, and YG, we love to flex
I'm rolling, off a double stack
I popped a molly, I'm on my back
Doing weird shit, acting kind of strange
All you need to know is bitch, I'm playing with some change
