[Verse 1]
This morning when I woke up I said fuck matchin
Im real tacky, and my pants saggin
My belt got double G's on it, so what's happening
I got plenty cash in my pocket
I gotta rocket on me whats poppin
Big Glock 40. Like a stop sign
How they stopping, hoes watchin

[Hook]
But I ain't worry bout it, you know I'm rockin
And I bet them folks don't fuck wit me
Cuz they know how I'm rockin
And I bet that hoe wanna fuck wit me
Cuz she know how I'm rockin
And this diamonds dancing all over me
You know how I'm rockin'

[Verse 2]
All the real nigga fuck with me, cuz they know how I'm rockin
And all the bad hoes wanna fuck me

All the bitches in here with my in over my baby
And all the niggas in here hate with my in ain't swaging

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
Ease my mind with a Kush pack, Piru my dogs roll that
Thousand niggas with me yelling 'brrat'
They'll lift your soul like Line Flat

On the east side where Scooter at, they say they killers where the bodies at (Squad!)
They know how we rocking
And when them niggas catch you slippin' 'fore them pistols they cockin'
And that check coming off your neck, cuz we know that you plugging
In the face can't wait no change, because she know that we stopping
Fucking up a check ain't shit to me
You gotta be a bad bitch if you're next to me
Just ask your man because she feelin' me
Four years in this game and I'm still screaming fuck this industry

Until ya'll get rid of me
Keep it one hundred like cabbage G

[Hook]
But I ain't worry bout it, you know I'm rockin
And I bet them folks don't fuck wit me

And I bet that hoe wanna fuck wit me
Cuz she know how I'm rockin
And this diamonds dancing all over me
You know how I'm rockin'
