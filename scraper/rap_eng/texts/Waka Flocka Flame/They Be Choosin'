These girls, they be choosing
Diamonds be so sparkly, they think my chain was moving
These girls, they be choosing
Diamonds be so sparkly, they think my chain was moving

[Verse 1: Just Rich Gates]
No ID, who the hell is that?
Them chicks pointing that it's me
Me, who? Just Rich, fresh up in a Ralph Lauren hat
ATL, South Cakk, holler back, we on the map
This for the fly boys, D-boys hit the club, then hit the trap
I'm rocking Polo, you're rocking GAP
I'm smoking kush, your smoking bap
You're a lame lamb
You look shocked, I'm throwing stacks like I don't give a Jean Claude Van Damme
Why? 'Cause bro, I'm paid in full like Rico
Oops, I meant Alpo, my chain and my ring
Yeah, it got the Mec glow
Lights off, i'm shining like the po-po
Them chicks on my jock, they love my orange swag
Cowabunga on you hoes
I'm so rad, I'm so rad

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
You can catch me in the club drinking bubbly
Two-stepping with Lauren London
Or too deep in VIP
Flocka and Alicia Keys (popping bottles, smoking kush)
Or hanging on the block with G's
Re-rocking Rico keys
And '09 is our year, wrapped the So Icey van
Hold up, homie, show me homie
Please stop all that fussing, homie
Rob me, homie, sorry, homie
Not Waka Flocka, homie
Sucking titties like a baby
Waka Flocka, you so crazy
Know my motto: "fuck you, pay me"
Four Deacon rings on like it's the eighties
One night, that bitch love the excitement
.45 with me, that's my hype man
I'm poured up, screwed up, that's my right hand
Rolled another bean, shawty, can't stop biting
My necpiece raining, it's like lightening
[?] call that shit frightening
Waka Flocka Flame, say I'm high like the Jetson
Roll another pill, I'm not flexing

[Verse 3: GE da Piolet]
G-E, J-C-E, campaign, whoa man
Goons gooning out, going Conan
803, this S-C, J-C-E, 15 South, what I'm 'bout
Shut your mouth, shut it up or we gon' shut it down
I'm the one, I'ma show them how it's done
Got ice like a blizzard, lick that pussy like a lizard
She "ooh-ing" and she choosing
Look, I don't want that hoe
I want a dime piece looking like a Ashanti
Diamond look like when the coast is clear
Shine like car headlights, y'all looking like a deer
My flow stupid, say I'm dumbing out, keep it Benji
We so rad, aura up
Aura up in the club, feeling like a spaceship
On the moon, on some spaceship, call me Mr. Spacely Sprockets
'Bout to blast off like a rocket
Automatic, we so galatic
