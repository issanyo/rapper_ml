[Intro]
One-zero-one-fucking-seven
Brick Squad!
Yeah, nigga, I'm finna annihilate your ass, nigga
One verse, pussy ass nigga
I ain't even got no hook for this shit
But this shit is so super duper personal, my nigga
Like, real talk
Like, homes so super lame, like
I perform at Libra, I get off the stage
Then homes start popping shit about a nigga
Ego tripping 'bout a nigga
The same nigga that wanna borrow a hundred dollars?
That nigga
The same nigga that say he balling, sleeping at hoes' house
Driving hoes' cars and shit
The same nigga, like...
Come on, man, this Flocka, nigga
Y'all niggas got me fucked up, nigga
LeBron Flocka James, nigga
Ain't shit changed, nigga
I still scrape up dollars and change, nigga
Real talk, nigga
No hook shawty, boy
One verse, you pussy ass boy
For real, nigga
This shit real, my nigga
They can't calm me down, nigga, right now, nigga
I'm on Hulk right now, nigga
Everything green, nigga
Diamonds green, gang green, nigga
Fuck y'all niggas talking about, nigga?
Waka Flocka, nigga
These niggas got me fucked up, man
Real talk

[Verse]
Throwing bullets back, don't wear throwbacks
He talk like Gucci, act like Gucci, rob ice like Gucci
Boy, stop! That's middle-of-the-mall jewelry
Ego tripping have these goons knock off your koofy
Better calm down before I fill that fade
Watch your chain, I'm throwing beads off, pussy nigga, what the fuck you claim?
We ain't the same clique, same label, the same gang
This is a public service announcement to the fake Gucci Mane
Them people on the east side [?] you, nigga
I ride on the B side, who are you, nigga?
You could play Ken, then I'm Ryu, nigga
Your clique not really right, fake Damu, nigga
Jealous and he envy me 'cause I'm realer than him
Jealous and he envy me, call the pussy Throw-B
Waka Flocka Flame in the club, where the gangstas be
In the club, rolling up nothing but that stinky tree

[Outro]
Little pussy ass nigga
Yeah, nigga
One verse your ass, nigga
I hope you heard this shit, nigga
You lucky, my nigga
You know my momma, I know your momma
That's why I can't touch your pussy ass, nigga
You know a nigga put that hands on a nigga, you gon' call 12, nigga
Yeah, nigga, and I heard when you was in prison, nigga
You was a trustee, nigga
You wasn't no real nigga
My nigga told me you wasn't even in the population, nigga
Stop popping like you gangsta, my nigga
Real talk, nigga, selling honey buns to get tattoo'd
Then come out, wallowing like you hard, nigga
You ain't no real nigga
Waka Flocka Flame
Gone
