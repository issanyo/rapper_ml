[Hook] (2x)
I said I'm tweeking, off the molly's
I said I'm tweeking, off the molly's
I said I'm tweeking, off the molly's
These niggas claiming that they killers, where's the body

[Verse 1]
I'm from Clayco, big straps and bad bitches
Foreign cars, nigga, I keep foreign bitches
Blowing Backwood's, Fed's snapping pictures
Waka Flocka Flame, I'm on Gangland
Sit back youngin', I got the game plan
My youngin's tweeking off the molly's and the Xan's
Big dog status now, nigga
I ain't gon' get you later, I'm gonna get your ass now nigga
Me, not bucking, how about that?
Bitch, I doubt that, I'm gon' shoot back
I keep big stacks, ass clap
Throw another rack, all I do is say

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]
I came a long way from the bike, now I'm in a foreign car
I came a long way from the block, now I'm on World Star
I could buy the bar, buy you a new car
Four blunts in my cigar, that's just how a nigga roll
My boys, they outta control, disrespect you get your head bust
That's how it go, 50K for a show
Boy, I got that glow, V.V.S.'s on my neck
Ruffy on that company, a nigga dropped the check
Don't disrespect, don't tell them rate that
Clay County, we on top, bet these pussies hate that
Money we gon' make that, run the sack up
Yes, a nigga tweeking, but my shooter's in the cut
Sizzle roll a blunt

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3]
Everybody real now, everybody trap
Claiming he gon' kill and he flexed up with the sack
Boy, I doubt that, my young niggas take that
Your town, I'ma paint that, red money make that
Pills got her ghost, I bet they hate that, ooh, it's pay back
Up six million just to let you niggas know that
Dirt Gang reckless, you run up they gon' shoot back
Waka Flocka Flame in this bitch
I'll change your bitch life, change your nigga life
With one verse I make that nigga a millionaire off that song
Jesus Christ
Them molly's got me tripping, twenty gold bottles in the VIP
Nigga what you sipping

[Hook] (2x)
