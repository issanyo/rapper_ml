[Hook]
I think he mad cus a young nigga took off
We drop them bags, you know them young niggas took off
Work hard Shawty, I ain’t tryna take off
A nigga play, I’mma knock his fuckin face off
Hit the bullet, oh boy I’m going AWOL
Said the K to them childrens behind that G wall
Got 100 for each chain, who say crime don't pay off?
When you live the street life, Shawty ain’t no days off

[Verse 1]
Hopped out that brand new Phantom like, "it’s me ho!"
Got killers everywhere, they find you, you ain’t Nemo
Bitches love my stylo, long dreaded, tatted like I'm Migos
KD fore that clean blow, shoot you like some D-rose
Push button foreigns, I don’t need to use no key, ho
No talk like camino, ball until my knee broke
Took a fuckin repo, I got killas out in Seaport
That’ll smoke you like a Newport, I’m so Clayton-county
You can call me Brother Reno, so illegal
My bitch Spanish real, she a leo
Her daddy got them kilos (you know)
So I blood that by my own work
Ain’t no frontin

[Hook]

I’ve been in these streets four nights and still ain’t changed clothes
I ain’t been the same since nigga bought that Franco
Boy you pussy Franco, finna matte black, call it Django
Live my life mob style, Tony Soprano
Ballin hoes, Jamayo, I get high like Halo
I like red jewelry, you can ask Raphaelo
Today I’m feelin coupe-ish, bought my money jewish
Can’t stop til the Forbes list, sellin strange, I wrote this
I don’t do no guest list and this shit is just like checkers
They’ll find me moving records, boy I think you jealous
I just think you envy, I’m just dre he dreamy
Throwin packs, you better catch it, call me Dan Marino

[Hook]
