[Verse 1]
I feel sorry for these bitches, I just fuck em and leave em
I feel sorry for these fake rappers, nobody believe em
I'm not sorry, I get money on my grind on these skaters
I don't feel sorry for my public go get this money I made ya
Well known street nigga, gang bang in my major
Got a lot of shooters and they owe me so many favors
I got a lot of killas from the Delowe to Dacatur
I got some youngins kicking doors, ain't talking no Oakland they Raiding
I'm flipping enterprise off rental cars from Avis
Can't get no chips with no ritz, so I gamble like Vegas
Place a bet my driver land, say a prayer that she make it
I'm the dealer might fuck with ya, just depend how ya play it

[Hook]
I'm sorry mama for the problems and the Headaches I give ya
I'm sorry dad for the hurtful shit I said I didn't mean it
I feel sorry for these niggas they can't help but be haters
I'm not sorry for these niggas broke,  go get you some paper (x4)

[Verse 2]
I read the news every morning gotta get me some paper
I'm not a rapper I'm a trapper, and a great entertainer
You gon' need a lifesaver Ill send you to your savior
I'm the coach, I'm the loaner, I'm the ref and the player
If he broke he a hater
If she broke I don't date her
Old lady on the plane, think I play for the Lakers
Cuz I ball like I'm Meeks
Loyalty  like I'm Meech
80 thousand for the rollie, quarter mill for the peace
Pink slip for my cars sorry you got a lease
I be doing the most, you be doing the least
I got a spot on the coast that sits right on the beach
Thanks to rapping you need some weed how about you buy it from me?

[Hook]
