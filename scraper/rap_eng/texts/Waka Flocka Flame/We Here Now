[Verse 1: Sean Teezy]
Northside politics, don't take me for no college kid
Getting money is the motto, so acknowledge it
Zoom zoom, my status on a rocket ship
Nonstop getting the gwap, you know what it is

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
We here now, we here now
We here now, we here now
This is real, we don't fuck around
This is real, we don't fuck around

[Verse 2: LA da Boomman]
See, I done made a lot of money, got a lot of status
Boomman up in here now
Haters, suck a dick now
Aiming my K on the track, I'm getting rich now
L-A up in here
Say, the Boomman up in here, let's go

[Verse 3: Eldorado Red]
Quarter mill for the deal, that's some real shit
Ronald McDonald chain cost a whole brick
Eldorado Red, dog, you ain't heard?
26-5 will get your ass a whole bird

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
"I fucked my money up", that's her favorite song
Twenties in the air, watch these hoes shake in thongs
Rose and Patron, that's gon' have me fucked up
One mixtape, green chain, what's up?

[Verse 5: Ms. GoHam]
M-S dot, damn I'm hot
Ms. GoHam got the club on lock
Niggas steady choosing, hoes steady hating
I just hit the lotto, money what I'm making

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
We here now, we here now
We here now, we here now
This is real, we don't fuck around
This is real, we don't fuck around

[Verse 6: Frenchie]
F-R-E-N-C-H, I'm excellent
Broke a pound down for my necklace
Make your head spin like the Exorcist
Stop bringing them fools through
Start claiming you're neutral
I know goons that'll shoot you
I'm here now and I'm not what you used to
Frenchie

[Verse 7: ET da Sandman]
And now, nigga, why you bullshitting?
Come on, let's get this money
Come on, let's get these hoes
Come on right now, let's go
I am the motherfucking best because I make it so
Make my dough
We here now, you niggas done for sure

[Verse 8: Young Snead]
Sitting at the table, [?] counting a lot of dollars
Love it when they hate me, nigga, that's my fucking motto
I just left the trap, all full pockets, got the measles
Try me if you wanna, you gon' meet this Desert Eagle

[Verse 9: Young Envy]
We so here, getting money out the ass, nigga
E's so here like I'm running out of gas
Got a Jag
Lot of swag, pop a lot of tags
Young Envy, we running shit, just call me on 100 clique, ayy

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
We here now, we here now
We here now, we here now
This is real, we don't fuck around
This is real, we don't fuck around

[Verse 10: Made In Atlanta - Chad & Rah Rah]
Once I come out the door, I glow, My flow is hot and they know
"Ayy, what's the name of your group?" Made In Atlanta, my nigga, it's a go
In the Aston Martin, two-door [?] copped me two more
And I'm on another world, so go on and send me off to Pluto

[Verse 11: Slim Dunkin]
Slim still dunking and y'all niggas taking layups
Extorting fake rappers, y'all niggas better pay up

[Verse 12: Young La'rue]
I'm gone, shawty, toodle-oo
You knew, though
You done made me run off in your spot and gun you down like Boogaloo
La'rue ain't the nigga to fuck with
Unless you want the salt, then I'm that guy that you fuck with

[Verse 13: Mykko Montana]
Mykko Montana, yeah, I'm here now
Better put your gun up 'cause I ain't backing down

[Verse 14: Da Kid]
I'm Mr. K-I-D Production, in the street, buzzing
Made a hundred grand, but I started off with one cent
And all of that, big dog manned up
The motto made the whole damn north side stand up

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
We here now, we here now
We here now, we here now
This is real, we don't fuck around
This is real, we don't fuck around
