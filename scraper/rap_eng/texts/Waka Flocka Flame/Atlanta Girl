[Intro: Black Boe]
Dunk, whoever, Flock
All them niggas (Travyy)
Go!

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
You do me and I'ma do you
Your turn, my turn, I'm through
No hand, no hand, Bluetooth
Tongue ring got a nigga like, "Whoo!"
Thick and skinny, eeny meeny
Redbone, black bikini
Chocolate mocha, Cappuccini
Boy Meets World, Mr. Feeny
Clark-Atlanta college chick stripping for a scholarship
Body like a dually truck, a lot of ass, a lot of hips
Red bottom, carrot top, legs shaved, hairy twat
Sweet candy, cherry drop, Cream Soda, berry pop

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'ma beat, beat, beat like a nail and a hammer
She a freak, freak, freak in the bed like pajamas
I like them sweet, sweet, sweet, cranberry Tropicana
I need a peach, peach, peach that's a girl from Atlanta (turn up)
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do

[Verse 2-Waka Flocka Flame & Derez De'Shon]
Damn, her ass fat (know she from Atlanta)
Always hanging out the back (like my bandana)
She showed me her thong, earring, and her tongue
She looked me in my eyes and said, "Boy, it's on"
So make that pussy bite back, bite back, bite back
So make that pussy bite back, bite back, bite back (what it do?)
I'm in the strip club, throwing money, showing love
The way she clap that ass got a nigga in love

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'ma beat, beat, beat like a nail and a hammer
She a freak, freak, freak in the bed like pajamas
I like them sweet, sweet, sweet, cranberry Tropicana
I need a peach, peach, peach that's a girl from Atlanta (turn up)
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do

[Verse 3: Black Boe & Ali]
I just do what I do and I'll do it again
If you ain't doing this shit, you better do it, my friend
Got them niggas on hush, got them haters on pause
Got them bitches on yes, got them hoes on (awww)
Skinny nigga tatted up and a nigga tall as fuck
All them bitches calling us 'cause all them hoes want all of us
I'ma beat, beat, beat like a nail and a hammer
Then I skeet, skeet, skeet all on her head, where's my manners?

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
I'ma beat, beat, beat like a nail and a hammer
She a freak, freak, freak in the bed like pajamas
I like them sweet, sweet, sweet, cranberry Tropicana
I need a peach, peach, peach that's a girl from Atlanta (turn up)
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
I just do what I just do and these hoes like the shit I do
