[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Mr. Zone 6'er, rock two pistols (Bow)
Mr. Zone 6'er, rock two pistols (Bow)
Fucked three sisters, iced out crystals (Burr)
M-Mr. Zone 6'er, M-Mr. Zoner 6'er

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm too hood, I'm too turnt (Turnt)
Ain't been an hour and a quarter pound burnt (Burnt)
Mr. Zone 6'er, rock two pistols (Bow)
Fucked three sisters, iced out crystals (Burr)
Tell you like you wanna know, iced out shorty (Bling, bling, bling)
Got a glow, blue block party, and you better know (Pow)
Fuckin bitches every show, one for the cheese
Two for the ki's, three's for the P's, four for the O.G.'s
I'm so sleaze I hit your main squeeze (Damn)
Rollin on 30's, like you rollin' on D's (Wow)
It big Gucci Goo-Wop
In the south top Beemer, that's convertible top

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm too fuckin' loyal, you too fuckin' spoiled
Bitch I'm gone off that hard, Brick Squad we barred
Them boys are high, them boys are high, them boys are high
We ballin' out, we ballin' out, we ballin' out, I'm too fuckin' loyal

[Verse 2: Richie Wess]
Who's the hottest in the game? Bitch I'm up next
Place your bet, its Richie Wess, cut the check
Twenty bands on my wrist, before the deal
Five bands, king of diamonds, make 'em tip drill (Work)
Make that ass clap, but leave your cameras at home
No cat stacks, plus the hammer all chrome
You better back, back
I'm smokin' strong, five hundred zone loud pack
You know about that? (Damn)
Yellow diamond neck (Neck), what's your occupation? (Work)
Bad red bone bitch, take her on vacation
I'm too fuckin' loyal, she so fuckin' spoiled
She wanna tell her friends, even her mama didn't

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm too fuckin' loyal, you too fuckin' spoiled
Bitch I'm gone off that hard, Brick Squad we barred
Them boys are high, them boys are high, them boys are high
We ballin' out, we ballin' out, we ballin' out, I'm too fuckin' loyal

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame & Gucci Mane]
They said I'm steamin', I'm bubblin', turn the fire up
You got loud, bring the fire
Call me a one-hit wonder I'll switch my flow up
Drop "No Hands" with Roscoe Dash, now I've blown up
I'm ballin out everywhere you see me, there's money on the ground
'Caine one bleaches me, in the four pound (Flags)
Higher than a motherfucker I smoke by the pound
I love to throw hundreds screamin', "stripper bitch drown"
Girls all around, me run me town
I drink, go bomb, more wired now
Pants down, Brick Squad we the shit
Waka Flocka Flame in 2011 [?] Mitch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I'm too fuckin' loyal, you too fuckin' spoiled
Bitch I'm gone off that hard, Brick Squad we barred
Them boys are high, them boys are high, them boys are high
We ballin' out, we ballin' out, we ballin' out, I'm too fuckin' loyal
