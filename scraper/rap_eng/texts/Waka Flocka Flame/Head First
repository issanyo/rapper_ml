[Hook]
I jumped into this rap game head first, head first
Fuck a body shot, aim head first, head first
She wanting me to fuck, I'm like: "head first, head first"
Waka Flock do everything head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling my self, I think I'm feeling my swag
Pockets full of faces, motherfuck a Louie bag
I stepped in the club, you know Flock got that glow
Traffic-light chain, you can call my bird go
Every show, smash it, Waka Flame, arrogant
My lifestyle, extravagant, I'm not with the marriagement
Kush, beer, liquor
Waka Flocka Flame, one head first nigga
Gucci, Frenchie, Wooh, Juice got the club going ham
10 grand flat for a party in Birmingham
When I hit the stage, I ain't doing no talking
They play "O Let's Do It" like they keep them girls off me

[Hook]
I jumped into this rap game head first, head first
Fuck a body shot, aim head first, head first
She wanting me to fuck, I'm like: "head first, head first"
Waka Flock do everything head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first

[Verse 1]
I'm on like J-Nicks, high like E.T
Spend like [?] has anybody heard of me?
I'm street like grey, I kill like Gucc
(Excuse me, what's your name?)
Call me Waka Flame, boo
Air Max 95's, I'm dancing to the beat
I'm not him and he's not me
He industry, I'm in the streets
It's a Rockman track, so I had to smoke the beat
Smoking like a chief, I'm talking indo
Offset my rims, tinted windows
'09 Vette, same color as Nintendo
Flying down the street, throwing money like Bingo

[Hook]
I jumped into this rap game head first, head first
Fuck a body shot, aim head first, head first
She wanting me to fuck, I'm like: "head first, head first"
Waka Flock do everything head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
Head first, head first
