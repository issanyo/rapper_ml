[Hook]
Said I wouldn't pop but I did it
I just might run up a ticket
Tell 'em, it's 50 to kick it
Trappin' like Fifty and Diddy
Used to kick doors up the hinges
Now I pull up in the Bentley
Bitch, I got love in my city
And I got plugs in your city
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
My paper straight like a big dawg
I'm holdin' weight like a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
Now I stay strapped like a big dawg
Hit from the back like a big dawg

[Verse 1]
Big dawg, big dawg hit him watch his shit fall
Run through the city like crip walk
Bitch, I got racks like Big Tymer
Run up on me trippin' they gon' miss y'all
Fuck nigga broke need to fix y'all
Chopper bullet comin' like a guitar
Never knew a nigga would make it this far
Big dawg, big dawg, walking through the city like a big dawg
Pull up on a nigga in a rented car
Strip a nigga neck like a pornstar
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg do I what wanna
Big dawg, blowin' marihuana
Used to run around, 50 bricks in Gucci Hummer
[?] dread nigga was the gunner
I feed your ass to some piranhas
Put you to bed like pyjamas
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
I'm runnin' shit like I'm congress
I'm gonna eat like regardless
Your big dawg paying me homage
I'm the Clay Co Mr. Rogers

[Hook]
Said I wouldn't pop but I did it
I just might run up a ticket
Tell 'em, it's 50 to kick it
Trappin' like Fifty and Diddy
Used to kick doors up the hinges
Now I pull up in the Bentley
Bitch, I got love in my city
And I got plugs in your city
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
My paper straight like a big dawg
I'm holdin' weight like a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
Now I stay strapped like a big dawg
Hit from the back like a big dawg

[Verse 2]
Nigga might pull up in a Mulsanne
Hell Street gang, what you claim
Call up my jeweler for a new chain
Used to have dirty ass shoestrings
Shooters on go when I tell 'em
Aimin' at your cerebellum
Youngins they tote Mac-11's
Aim it and smoke out your melon
You know the code, never tellin'
I got your hoe at the West End
Niggas lookin' for me like Chapo
Make that ass clap like bravo
Pull up with the chickens like Rasco
Strapped up, hanging out the top hole
Big dawg, stayin' on my box shit
Get your ass wet, don't cause shit
The ice don't make you a big dawg
You got that paper like Kris Kross
Fuck nigga runnin' off with the [?]
Maybach droppin', no Rick Ross
Big dawg, big dawg, soak up some game lil' nigga
Big dawg, big dawg stay in your lane lil' nigga

[Hook]
Said I wouldn't pop but I did it
I just might run up a ticket
Tell 'em, it's 50 to kick it
Trappin' like Fifty and Diddy
Used to kick doors up the hinges
Now I pull up in the Bentley
Bitch, I got love in my city
And I got plugs in your city
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
My paper straight like a big dawg
I'm holdin' weight like a big dawg
Big dawg, big dawg, big dawg, big dawg
Now I stay strapped like a big dawg
Hit from the back like a big dawg
