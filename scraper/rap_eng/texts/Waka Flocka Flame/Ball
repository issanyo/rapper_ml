[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all, yeah
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, shotta
Bottle popper
Record breaker
Never a hater
Euro and Yen, Euro and Yen
Pound, dollar, hoarding it up
Money to save, money to spend
Girl come to the telly with some of your friends
What you know about about that?
On the roads and all my shows packed
New swag cause the flow got jacked
Fuck rap, going back to the trap
Limelight, is kind of bright
I don't handle bars, I ain't riding bikes
Rappers talk, they ain't trying to fight
Live the final life with the wildest nights
I just wanna ball, get away with selling Ps
I just wanna catch a show for two hundred G's
Free my nigga KK, free my big dawg Gucci
I'm the reason why your baby mother on her fucking knees

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all, yeah
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all, yeah
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball

[Verse 2: Jay Fizzle]
Lil Bow Wow, like Mike I wanna ball
N.W.A, Ice Cube, fuck the law
Extensions in my drawers, fuck 'em, shoot 'em all
Step too close to me, I bash your head, no baseball
Sliding in some foreign, I heard police is looking for me
Fuck my court date, tell the judge I said fuck 'em
Cuz said touch 'em, so Jay Fizzle touched 'em
I just handle wax when big homie send me the message
Killed 'em yesterday now this morning I'm up in Texas
I just caught a body cause niggas can't learn their lesson
I just wanna stunt, I just wanna flex
Ride 'round with that [?] and that Z51 vet

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all, yeah
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball

[Hook: Young Dolph]
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
Middle finger out the roof like mother fuck 'em all, yeah
I just wanna ball, I just wanna ball
