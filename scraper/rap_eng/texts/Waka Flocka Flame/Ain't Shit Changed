[Verse 1]
Thirty-Nine thousand in the whole in taxes
Can't Wesley Snipes me you jealous bastards
My Phantom Ghost came with champagne glasses
BSM, we go hard, no Cialis
Took us universal, toured all around the atlas
Way above average, we winning, hate hating
My swag is immaculate, hit 'em with a Mac clip
Gave your girl mad dick, pulled up Randy Savage
Bands, gotta have it, I'm a proud bastard

[Hook]
Lord why they arguing over short change
Where I'm from we want the money, middle finger fame
Off a couple million, ain't shit really changed
Same nigga, same clique, ain't shit changed
Same nigga, same clique, ain't shit changed

[Verse 2]
Known for acting wild around town with the ratchet
Dreams I'mma snatch it, bullshit I'm over it
I did what they said I couldn't do with three years
Lost a couple friends, shit some mommies shed tears
Some call me a star but say I promote gang violence
Heard I'd never make it past one single
Look at me now, look at me now
Ain't that shit a lie
I changed the sound of hip-hop when Flockaveli dropped

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm off a couple million, niggas looking at me funny
Yes they love me dirty, fuck them shoes in bummy
Signed to a major but they treat me like an Indie
Seen the bigger picture but they busy chasing pennies
My family tree the gangster, my momma she a gangster
My daddy died a gangster, mean boys middle fingers
You don't like my music, you don't know me I don't blame you
You don't like my music, never met you, I don't blame you

[Hook]
