[Hook]
Pullin' up with a couple shooters
I could give a f*** about this f****** music
Pullin', pullin' up, pullin' up
With a pullin', pullin', pullin', pullin'
Pullin' up with a couple shooters
I could give a f*** about this f****** music
Ah (gunshot)
Flockmix

I tell these niggas take notes  man
Nigga like “fuck graduating  nigga sellin' coke
That's a fucked up logic, man (buddy)
And these hoes right fuckin' for new bags
Stealin' swag

[Verse 1]
You lame rappers views from a real Piru
Married to the game, “I do” (what)
I'm ridin' through in that chicken coop
'Dem birds in it when I'm slidin' through
Can't finesse a brick like I do
You lil niggas can't walk a mile in my footsteps
Pussy, we don't wear the same size shoe
Punch him in his face, feed him chicken soup
Surgeries in that institute (yah)
Record his ass while I whoop his ass
And put it on my album as the interlude (yaa)
My circle tighter than an inner tube
Always talking' what you finna do?
I think you lames hit your pinnacle
Rappers on too many chemicals
Where the f*** is y'all principles?
This Brick Squad I'm the general
Middle finger grab my genitals
Why the f*** my niece in the news?(ah)
Always talking' What Flocka doing
Always talkin What Waka doin'?
Countin' money bitch I'm thumbing through it
You got a problem bitch I'm comin' to it

[Hook]
Pullin' up with a couple shooters
I could give a f*** about this f*****’ music
I'll f*** you up and there's nothin' to it
Whole squad ridin' like a f*****’ Buick
I know I'm winning but If*****’ lose it
And beat the case cause my lawyer Jewish (yah)
Grimy nigga came from the sewage
Put them hands on you like Lenny Lewis
Really whip these shits if you diss me b****
Then it's a wrap like Christmas gifts
It's arithmetic, I'ma hit the lick
We gon snatch the bag, then split the chips
Out in Colorado, go and f*** with Spence
VBS is on me  never tuck it in
The haters out but the love is in
Makin' major flips like above the rim (Flex)

[Verse 2]
F****** up the dough cause I can't cook
So I made a million on Facebook
So underrated feel like Westbrook
I'm runnin' plays it's textbook
Coupla rappers solid but the rest shook
They say I can't rap, so I came back
With dumb punchlines gave 'em left hooks

Back from the dead I'm Jon Snow
Toe tag him  he a John Doe
I feel like young Scooter, no convo
Watch out for snakes, keep the lawn mowed
Why these niggas thinkin' that they Pablo
Cause they watched an episode of Narcos
This is real life shotta f**** flows
And you lyrical n*ggas (f***)
Caught a case now you spiritual, n*gga
The feds put some fear in you, n*gga?
What they put years on you, n*gga?
Yo I see a tear droppin n*gga?
Told Chance to teardrop that n*gga
I take the chair my n*gga
Loyalty real my n*gga
Yo (Waka)

[Outro]
F*** [?] the niggas man?
Just turned 30  man
So how old you think your favorite rapper is  man?
I was listening to n*ggas in middle school
Move over grandaddy
Squad Flockaveli 2
Gang gang
