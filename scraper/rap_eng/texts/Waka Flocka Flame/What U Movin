[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Got the blow
Spaceships
Coke parties
Grimlin

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
She sniffing cocaine off the table
Migo plug off a white gold
I'm in Texas looking for the Act
They like "Waka Flocka Flame back"
My whole hood full of gang bangers
I ain't selling you shit, if you ain't gang bangin'
Your name ain't ringing if you ain't shooting
Fuck the club, bitch we dope swinging, what you movin'?
(Trap, trap, trap, trap)
Off a brick (Trap, trap, trap, trap)
Whole motherfucking brick

[Verse 1: Jimmy Rocket & Waka Flocka Flame]
Old niggas out here living off them old war stories
Fuck that nigga hood, Jimmy Rocket go shoot up the place
Okay yeah, them young niggas hop and making it spray
The K got a drum like I played in the band
The grip on this stick is the size of a can
When I let the bitch go, it gon' sing like Roxanne
We sending them shots at your memory glands
Like Minecraft, we gon' take over your land
You don't think she got ace in the cut
[?] dope, then buy Pizza Hut
I'm a dog to these hoes like a mutt
I'm on Roosevelt, chilling with Theodore
We got big guns, you have to see before
You need 2k, like I don't fuck with EA Sports
Most of these rappers remind me of [?]
I was hard-hittin' nigga, I ain't even go to school
Y'all niggas shit, hittin' licks [??]
[?] hopping out the Benz like an Uber pool
Jim yeah

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
She sniffing cocaine off the table
Migo plug off a white gold
I'm in Texas looking for the Act
They like "Waka Flocka Flame back"
My whole hood full of gang bangers
I ain't selling you shit, if you ain't gang bangin'
Your name ain't ringing if you ain't shooting
Fuck the club, bitch we dope swinging, what you movin'?

[Verse 2: Jimmy Rocket & Waka Flocka Flame]
Get to the money nigga, what you doin'? What you movin'?
Extendos, extendos, we don't play Nintendo, we hop out the rental, [?] put your thoughts on the ground
I do not talk, my jewellery too loud
You know that lame shit is not allowed
I'm in your hood and you not around
They don't want beef like a cow
I got these hoes turnin' heads like an owl (squad)
You niggas is dead if the homie go 'bow!' (squad)
That stick get to wavin' like it's in a crowd
These double-oh-seven guys ain't got no sound
These fuck-niggas talkin' down
Talkin' shit till a nigga run around town
[?] James Brown
I'll leave a nigga body in the lost-and-found
If you wanna be [?], gotta stay down
All these hoes gettin' bussed like a Greyhound
[?]
I'ma run to that bag like Sonic

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
She sniffing cocaine off the table
Migo plug off a white gold
I'm in Texas looking for the Act (Act, Act, Act)
They like "Waka Flocka Flame back"
My whole hood full of gang bangers (squad)
I ain't selling you shit, if you ain't gang bangin' (brick squad)
Your name ain't ringing if you ain't shooting
Fuck the club, bitch we dope swinging, what you movin'?
