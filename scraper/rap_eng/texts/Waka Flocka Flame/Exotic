[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I can't fuck if she ain't exotic
I can't smoke if it ain't exotic
If it ain't foreign I can't drive it
All my cars, they exotic
Still pull up in your projects (Flocka)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (You know)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (Flex)
Quarter million worth of diamonds
Bitch I'm piped up
Bitch I'm piped up
Piped up
Way too piped up

[Verse 1: Belly]
Sip slow till we fast asleep
These hoes shallow but the caption deep
First one up, I'm the last to sleep
I might pull up with the tank like Master P
Cold wrist, smoke loud, I just won't listen
Still balling like ole' Miss
Still stunting on my own bitches
Drugs exotic, I'm a nervous wreck
I think I deserve the best
Liquor batch lean perk percocet
I don't even feel this shit working yet
Keep it trill, shouts to Bun B
Bitches jumping off with no bungie
Might pull up like Puff in the Humvee
Animals in your house like Jumanji

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I can't fuck if she ain't exotic
I can't smoke if it ain't exotic
If it ain't foreign I can't drive it
All my cars, they exotic
Still pull up in your projects (Flocka)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (You know)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (Flex)
Quarter million worth of diamonds
Bitch I'm piped up
Bitch I'm piped up
Piped up
Way too piped up

[Verse 2: Belly]
Too sick for an antitode
I'm a lion you an antelope
Big big ounces, cantelope
Married to the game and you can't elope
Too legend in my city with a few legends
New weapon, got me looking like I'm two stepping
Taking pictures with bottles you never paid for
Posing in front of cars but they ain't yours
But I still eat the pussy like a main course
Weed louder than a chainsaw
Exotic product, pills, chronic, gin and tonic
Profit is the only topic
Popping out the cockpit bitch I'm popping
You stay on the rebound Dennis Rodman

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I can't fuck if she ain't exotic
I can't smoke if it ain't exotic
If it ain't foreign I can't drive it
All my cars, they exotic
Still pull up in your projects (Flocka)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (You know)
Quarter million worth of diamonds (Flex)
Quarter million worth of diamonds
Bitch I'm piped up
Bitch I'm piped up
Piped up
Way too piped up

[Outro: Belly]
Pull up with my bitch she exotic
Smoking on some shit that's exotic
Driving foreign whips, that's exotic
Exotic, exotic
Pop, pop, pop it for a profit
Private flights to the tropics
See me hopping out the cockpit
Exotic, exotic
