[Intro: KSI]
Jump around! Jump around! Jump around!
Jump up, jump up and get down!

[Verse 1: KSI]
Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
It's K-S-I yeah, here we go again
Tekken with the flow, bussin' like i'm Jin
Got the people saying: "JJ, you're going in!"
The new jumpman, from the UK gang
No baller but i give you girls that 2K Slam
And all around the world I talk that UK slang
They say: "I don't understand you, but you ain't bad"
(Jump around!)
Skip the ad and get straight to the point (Jump around!)
Get a cab and get straight to that joint (Jump around!)
And this ain't about makin' some coins, I just want to see the whole crowd makin' some noise (Jump around!)

[Hook: KSI]
Everytime when we go all in in the club (Jump around!)
Everytime when we go ballin' as a MOB (Jump around!)
All together when we jump up we go off
(Jump up, jump up and get down!)

Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)

Jump when it's playin', jump on a plane
Jump in a whip, jump on the stage
Jump in a hotel, jump in the rave
Jump in an Aston, jump in a Range

[Verse 2: KSI]
Get a birds eye view, lose your mind 'til you get a worse IQ
Her eyes brown and her eyes blue
It's not a problem if I haven't said the words "I do"
(Jump around!)
Skip the ad and get straight to the point (Jump around!)
Get a cab and get straight to that joint (Jump around!)
And this ain't about makin' some coins, I just want to see the whole crowd makin' some noise (Jump around!)

[Hook: KSI]
Everytime when we go all in in the club (Jump around!)
Everytime when we go ballin' as a MOB (Jump around!)
All together when we jump up we go off
(Jump up, jump up and get down!)

Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)

Jump when it's playin', jump on a plane
Jump in a whip, jump on the stage
Jump in a hotel, jump in the rave
Jump in an Aston, jump in a Raa-

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Jump up and down, shorty moshpit
Jump up and down, shorty moshpit
Jump up and down, shorty moshpit
Your main girl look like a sidechick
My dreads lie wild like a rockstar
Party turned up, we don't need a ball
I came a long way from a rockstar
Look at Waka Flocka Flame standing on a cop car
Off the car crowdsurf in the crowd
Everybody hands up, yeah loud
I'm a party animal, I took a bow
Me and KSI, boy it's going down

[Hook: KSI]
Everytime when we go all in in the club (Jump around!)
Everytime when we go ballin' as a MOB (Jump around!)
All together when we jump up we go off
(Jump up, jump up and get down!)

Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)

Jump when it's playin', jump in a plane
Jump in a whip, jump on the stage
Jump in a hotel, jump in the rave
Jump in an Aston, jump in a Raa-
