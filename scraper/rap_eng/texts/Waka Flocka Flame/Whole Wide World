(Verse 1: Waka Flocka)
Thank god for the block and the street lights
The way them niggas treat me when my life wasn't right
When I was fucked up, everybody laughed
Now I got some money, niggas want a part of my cash
Kiss my ass, black mask
When a nigga didn't have it, had to rob fast
On the block I'm tryna get it
Dope man's dream, 15 years, I've been tryna live it
Part of my pivot, if I came up wrong
Don't blame me for what I grew up in
I'm a product of my environment
Head first, yes, so I jumped all in
Then I picked up a pen and a pad
Changed a nigga life, I'm doing shows all over the world
Shit I feel invincible
If these fans show you love like this, you would too
To my brother Kwan, Kao and Ru
From me to you, you ain't gotta work a day in your life
That's why I go hard in the bunker booth
And when I do a show on the stage
Make these fans feel everything I wrote on the page
Yeah, kiss my ass nigga, this my year

[Hook: Avery Storm]
All I know is this struggle that rains rain
And I love my block cause on top
They the one save me
I gotta keep my grind just when I
Let them take me
And sure feel good to know they couldn't break me
I tell em how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
To be invincible
I tell em how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
To be invincible
I tell em how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
To be invincible
I tell em how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
To be invincible

(Verse 2: Waka Flocka)
Some say I'm illiterate, others say I can't count
Bet I know them numbers in my bank account
They say I can't rap, I agree
5 million later with no college degree
My friends, fans and family I can't go without
My grandma say the devil tryna take me out
I kept god first, always knew to bomb first
In every verse shawty get a vocal hearse
Follow quotes from these great men
Put me anywhere on god's green earth
I'mma triple my work, the son of devil
I can do whatever
Make money anywhere, through any weather
However people hating in and criticizing anything I do
Wanna blog about me, surround myself with positive energy
Get the negative away from me, nigga this my year, Flocka!
