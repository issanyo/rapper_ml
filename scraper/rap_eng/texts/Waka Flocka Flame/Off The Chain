[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
This motherfucker off the chain, bruh
Shit, four years ago, mane
I ain’t even have like, shit, like
5 hundred, motherfucker
But I got like 5 hundred racks easily

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got your girl freaking off the chain (you know)
The club off the leash, it’s off the chain (you know)
They think a young nigga selling ‘caine (bricks)
Just bought Red Ferraris for the gang (you know)
I said we getting money, boy, I love to splurge
Brand new Phantom, I got it off the curve
I started from the bottom, this what I deserve
Screaming “Oh, let’s do it!” making millions off my words

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
8 120, just to tell time
He had it back then, then he lost it Kobe Bryant
Came a long way from hanging in that weed house
Being on the road, fucking groupies, snatching weaves out
They say I bring the thieves out, the club off the chain
First rap check, I bought a house and got a chain
Now I’m popping Champagne, celebrate how far we came
A couple of niggas switched up on me, swear I never change
Now I'm fucking niggas [?], replacing they names
Focused on the [?], the rap hall of fame
Took off for a year, I bounce back like cocaine
I keep cold hearted killers round me that love to bang
Squad!

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Chaz Gotti]
I came from the bottom, yeah straight from the dirt
Now a nigga flexing diamonds, made a million of the work
Trying to get this yell up in my verse so I can kill it in a hearse
Owe me money? Reimburse
Turned your blessing to a curse, n-n-n-nigga
Diamonds dripping, call it Aqua Man
Apron on a bitch, cleaning pots and pans
Still jugging that Peter Pan, my PO want to see me in
2 bitches with me, you see her friend
Black tints, you see the Benz
Say you in the trap, say you got the work
But your hood life, nigga where you been?
See the club? Off the chain
B-B-B.S.M on my chain
Cha-Cha-Chaz Gotti my name
R-R-R-Red Crew, the Dirt Gang (Dirt Gang!)
Green light off your name
My wrist looking like cocaine
I’m a real nigga and a true shooter, just ask Flocka Flame

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
