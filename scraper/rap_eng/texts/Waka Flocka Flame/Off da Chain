[Intro: David Blayne]
Uh
Ah, yeah
So Icey Entertainment
Waka Flocka
Suga Shane
And David Blayne
Tay and Lex on the beat

[Hook: David Blayne]
It's a goddamn shame, the way I do the game
I'm R&B straight drop, pure cocaine
David Blayne, now you know the name
You better hide your bitch before your bitch be off the chain
Off the chain, we going insane
We 'bout a hundred deep when we creep, me and Waka Flocka Flame
So please stay in your lane
Don't let that alcohol get a hole in your brain

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
He a lab rat, I can't respect a nigga
Hennessy, Patr√≥n and Goose got him wet, nigga
Boy, that good pussy got a nigga seasick
In the club like, point at what bitch
All these hoes in this club straight chewing
Flocka, what you doing? Ride it, Patrick Ewing
Blowing loud, kush stinking like a fucking skunk
Boy, don't play with me, burn you like a fucking blunt
Suga Shane, Waka Flame got them going ham
David Blayne on the hook, boy, goddamn
10-5 for a verse call me Uncle Sam
Waka Flocka Flame got the club going ham
"O Let's Do It", that's the brand new single
Waka Flocka Flame, two hoes, let's mingle
Popped two pills, now a nigga rolling
Benz cool, but the rims straight stolen

[Hook: David Blayne]
It's a goddamn shame, the way I do the game
I'm R&B straight drop, pure cocaine
David Blayne, now you know the name
You better hide your bitch before your bitch be off the chain
Off the chain, we going insane
We 'bout a hundred deep when we creep, me and Waka Flocka Flame
So please stay in your lane
Don't let that alcohol get a hole in your brain

[Verse 2: Suga Shane]
Who's in the club and the hoes out back
Still here thugging, dog, let the pants sag
'Round here, waving 'round the all red rag
And I really do this shit, dog, I ain't gotta brag
Walking through the club like an "S" on my chest
Swagging through the club, dog, you're fucking with the best
Light-skinned chick, go head first for the cash
So I'm all in the club, never spending my last
Buy a couple bottles, shawty, just bring a glass
This is how I do it at the top of my class
Get it till that getting gone, would be on that spinning chrome
Catch me in the parking lot with me and my thugs, we getting it on
Yeah, call the Brick Squad clique
Told them to hook it up, dog, I need the shit quick
Move a couple bricks because we got them for the low
And we ball in the club, dog, you know how it goes

[Hook: David Blayne]
It's a goddamn shame, the way I do the game
I'm R&B straight drop, pure cocaine
David Blayne, now you know the name
You better hide your bitch before your bitch be off the chain
Off the chain, we going insane
We 'bout a hundred deep when we creep, me and Waka Flocka Flame
So please stay in your lane
Don't let that alcohol get a hole in your brain

[Verse 3: David Blayne]
Put your drinks in the air, hands in the air
Wave them side to side like you just don't care
Put your rag up, throw your sets up
All my niggas from the block, rep your hood, bruh
And all my independent ladies that can buy they own bottles
Pay their own bills and got a body like a model
I'm stunting on these niggas, living like there's no tomorrow
Game over for these haters, you don't really want it

[Hook: David Blayne]
It's a goddamn shame, the way I do the game
I'm R&B straight drop, pure cocaine
David Blayne, now you know the name
You better hide your bitch before your bitch be off the chain
Off the chain, we going insane
We 'bout a hundred deep when we creep, me and Waka Flocka Flame
So please stay in your lane
Don't let that alcohol get a hole in your brain
