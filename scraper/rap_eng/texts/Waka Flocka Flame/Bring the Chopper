[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
F-R-double-E, free my nigga Doe B
Where the gangstas? Weed, shawty, where the gangstas be?
I can't really fucking see 'cause I'm rolling off this weed
This a motherfucking Tay Beat, I paid 'bout 30 grand
And my rap sheet long as Shaq's feet
Plus my neck piece green as my stacks be
I'm unhappy, disrespect Wooh and Frenchie or Juice and Gucci
Leave you wet like some motherfucking good coochie
Hit them with the Uzi, leave that nigga woozy
Out the passenger side, dumping out the dooley
Lights, cameras, fucking action, life is a movie
But I'm the shooter, not the fucking narrator
I'm just Flocka
No motherfucking aim with the chopper
Shawty from Riverdale
Where them boys give you hell
No O.G., just my nigga
Running 'round town like cowboys, nigga
Waka Flocka Flame my name, my nigga
Two pistols on me like a cowboy, nigga

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
One-zero-one-seven, red bandanna around my Mac-11
Nine o'clock, nine niggas, nine crooks, and nine killers
Eight where that nine drop, run up in that fuck spot
Make that nigga life stop, that's how Waka Flocka rock
On my mama, shawty, hit them with the llama
Bomb them like Osama, black like Obama
Dreads like Marley, golds like Juice
Taste Like Gucci, crazy like Wooh
Shawty like Frenchie, black like Corey
Crazy like Capp, crazy like [?]
Say it like [?], riding like Kebo
[?], it's no pad, no fucking pencil
Volume two
Screaming out, fucking: "su woo"
Where your red rag? Throw up your blue rag
Throw up your black rag, throw up your yellow flags
Salute Kinto
Salute OG Stoppey
Salute Big KK
Salute BB and John
Plus Pac, where them niggas at?
That was my fucking OG's
Salute motherfucking Auntie
This the intro, shawty
No pad, no fucking pencil, shawty
Volume two, my nigga
Waka Flocka Flame and my nigga named Tizzle
