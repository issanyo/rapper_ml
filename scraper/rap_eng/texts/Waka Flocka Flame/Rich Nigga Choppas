[Chorus:]
Flocka
I’m too flocka, get shot down by rich nigga choppas
What you mean?
Put the word out that my youngest don’t drop you
My own team, press for monopoly, ain’t no stopping us
What you mean? Fuck with me you go need a doctor
911 it’s a emergency
Goddy’s mamma crying, hope he make it through that surgery
911 it’s a emergency
Goddy’s  mamma crying, hope he make it through that surgery

[Verse 1:]
I told you Tony, don’t you fucking cross me man
You fucking talker, I told you man
What the fuck was you thinking man?
Two two threes in a brand new yappa
Chop a nigga shit like Boraco
Should never draw like a blocker
Shoot like a point glide, hands like a boxer
You niggas don’t want these problems
Keep a big strap, got kick no stop them (replay)
The Bible says, there’s something like possum
And I don’t get too fuck by the copper
Road drop, I run down and I hop
Better done, don’t know when they gonna stop
My youngest, they brazen, you know how [?]
911 it’s a mother fucking emergency
Imma go be a rich car rooms till they heard it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
See right, this will never fucking happen man
If you never turned your back man
See, you never turn your fucking back on family man
What the fuck you doing cover up?
Imma a GUCC, everything I do man
Kick shit like Lu Kang, put up in a Mustang
Street nigga flocka, ain’t no business in a soup man
All I got to do is put the word out in your food man
I don’t play no fucking games, green light in everything
Good on the west coast, all my niggas gang bang
Good in the midwest, all my niggas grimy man
Good on Melvin Dow, south Atlanta is fucking gangster

[Chorus]
