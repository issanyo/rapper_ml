[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
All I know is smoke weed, rob, steal, and sell dope
Roll dice, get money and gangbang with my folk
Dre, Capp, and Waka, handguns and choppers
Can't find you, then we dumping on your mama
All I know is smoke weed, rob, steal, and sell dope
Roll dice, get money and gangbang with my folk
Dre, Capp, and Waka, handguns and choppers
Can't find you? Then we dumping on your mama

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Never again will I let a fuck try me
.45 on my hip, gon' check them if they try me
Squiggly lines and ivy, closed caskets, you dumb bastards
From eastside to Riverdale, fake wheels and thunder bells
That's gon' keep my pockets swell, hell yeah, I rob and steal
Gucci, he gon' post the bail, hand on my dick like, fuck jail
Swear to God, I won't tell, swear to God, I won't tell
For my clique, I'ma ride or die, for my clique, I'ma ride or die
Eating on some chips, [?] smoking on a blunt
Chilling on the front porch, [?] pulled up in the front
Now I'm grabbing on my pistol and I'm running with the blunt
They think a nigga scared, I ain't no motherfucking chump

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
All I know is smoke weed, rob, steal, and sell dope
Roll dice, get money and gangbang with my folk

Can't find you, then we dumping on your mama
All I know is smoke weed, rob, steal, and sell dope
Roll dice, get money and gangbang with my folk
Dre, Capp, and Waka, handguns and choppers

[Verse 2: Dre]
Bet you I'ma bang mine
Mac 90 lift and give him Micheal Jordan hang time
Brick Squad bricks in, nigga, it's cocaine time
Five finger, bird finger, nigga, that's my gang sign
Try me, please come try, dog, one man's not man enough
If he stands six feet, bury him standing up
Nobody, I mean nobody on the squad would [?] as hell
Grand National on 24's ain't in Riverdale
Yeah, try to act right now
'Cause I'm in that damn room, I got that Mac right now
Told you, nigga, try to act right now
'Cause I'm in that damn room, I got that Mac right now

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
Yellow tape, white top, black by the bag
Ambulance on the way 'cause I shot his ass
He wanted beef, so I'm around, 'round looking for him
Let that chopper heat him up like I was cooking for him
AR-15, Carbon 1-5
You tried the wrong dog like you had nine lives
Pussy cat, pussy nigga, what you looking at?
'Cause all my niggas either robbing or cooking crack
I'm the king of the jungle betta remember, I'm Simba
You like Terrell Davis from Denver
'Cause every time you see me, you be running back
You know my favorite four words: "where the money at?"
Pussy
