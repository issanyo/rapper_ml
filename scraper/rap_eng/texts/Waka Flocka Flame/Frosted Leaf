[Intro]
Whoo Kid
DatPiff.com world premiere

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
I'ma throw some good vibes out there
So won't nobody be trippin'
Like if Freaknik was mixed with Woodstock and wasn't no cops
'Cause wasn't nobody trippin'
Oh, don't you wanna go there?
Don't you wanna go there?
So won't nobody be trippin'

[Verse: Tony Yayo]
Hawaiian snow under the microscope
Greenhouse, Red Light, about to eat smoke
No laws, I feel so free there
Zero violence, weed all in the air
I'm 'bout to hit Bob Marley's shop
Roll a big spliff with some Guinness style
No cameras in the Red Light
And them girls get tested by the government, and every night
Eat a weed brownie and catch a sex show
Guy in a gorilla suit fuck a nympho
Roll up, I feel so free here
Bongs made of ice, smoke the best weed here
But it's time to leave here
Next stop London, bruv got a nigga in
And I left 50 bags in the 'telly
To call my office up, just to fuckin' tell me

[Interlude: Tony Yayo]
You know, they thought I was booked for two more days in Amsterdam in the Grand Hotel
I left 50 bags of weed there, you know, but...
They called me up to tell me I left my weed
I was in London, I can't bring that shit on the plane, you know?
Whoo Kid

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
Wanna go somewhere
Where all my niggas is just livin'
Like if Freaknik was mixed with Woodstock and wasn't no cops
'Cause wasn't nobody trippin'
Oh, don't you wanna go there?
(Fuckin' up the vibe in here, never fuckin' up the vibe in here)
Don't you wanna go there?
(Fuckin' up the vibe in here, never fuckin' up the vibe in here)
Don't you wanna go there?
(Fuckin' up the vibe in here, never fuckin' up the vibe in here)
Don't you wanna go there?
(Fuckin' up the vibe in here, never fuckin' up the vibe in here)
So won't nobody be trippin'

[Outro: Watch The Duck & Waka Flocka Flame]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Brick Squad!
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Whoo Kid
Never fuckin' up the vibe in here
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never fuckin' up the vibe in here
Fatality
