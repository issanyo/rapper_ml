Sat his mama on the couch, nigga, where the work at?
Who upstairs? Shawty, what the fuck that noise is?
Man, that's my daughter, that's my girl, man, they mean the whole world
Fuck your daughter, fuck your girl, get the fuck up out this world
Born broke, born fucked up, I'ma shoot this shit up
Lick successful, now a nigga in the whip
Visualizing kickdoors, trying to get rich
Code of the streets, never snitch, never talk to a bitch
If you slip, you'll be found in a ditch
