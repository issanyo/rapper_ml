[Chorus: Waka Flocka & B.o.B]
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I wanna see that ass and them elbows, bitch
All about a dollar like Creflo, bitch
I give her snaps on a Pedro, bitch
And she go H.A.M. on a breadroll
Feelin' zesty, kissin' on her bestie
Archive, archive, archive, archive
Both hands needed like a jet-ski
Head on my iCloud, ass on my hard drive
Keep dancin' mamma, pose
Peep the wood in the morning, you will see a nigga woke
And that ass on woke, and them titties on perc
When you gon' twerk, bitch?

[Chorus: Waka Flocka & B.o.B]
Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)
Head, knees, shoulders, toes (yeah, yeah)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna rock right now
I really, really wanna rock right now
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
I wanna see your ass in your elbows
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
(shoulders, knees, toes)
I wanna see your ass in your elbows

[Verse 2: Amara La Negra]
Good girl, bad girl, got horns in her halo
Comin' for the hooter and the G's in the [?]
Face get beat, tell her come and get a facial
And the liquor get her snappin' like Fabo
These hoes all want the same thing
White fence, big house, name change
[? Spanish]
Soy Mona Lisa, Picasso
[? Spanish]
I know this is what you want
That's why I'mma back it up
[?] but I love it
Do the beggar, pull it up

[Outro: Waka Flocka & B.o.B & Amara La Negra]
(I wanna see your ass in your elbows)
(I wanna see your ass in your elbows)
(I wanna see your ass in your elbows)
She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"
Right now
She wanna rock right now
Said she was straight, but she not right now
Act like a saint, but a thot right now
All in my face, told her "not right now"
Right now
(I wanna see your ass in your elbows)
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bang, bang, Bobby!
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
B.o.B, B.o.B, I said B.o.B
