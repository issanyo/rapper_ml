[Chorus]
They wanna see me dead, put prices on my head
Spreading rumors around town, like I fell down
They can't hold me down, they can't stop my shine
They can't block my grind, shawty, it's game time
Piru for life, breads off the Elms, nigga
I ain't big on lick 'cause I ain't been to the motherland
Here I stand, grown ass man
Gun in my hand, I don't fear no man

[Verse 1]
These niggas fucking tripping, second-guessing my living
Better tell them I'm gon' kill them
Twenty bands, then tell them come get them
Make your boy scared to say damn, I think that I scared him
I swear to God, don't fear him, these niggas straight tripping
Thinking that I'm slipping pull it out then I'm ripping
My whole click itching, looking for the fucking victim
Free my partner Isum, tunnel fucking vision
I swear to God on Jesus Christ, I don't fucking hear them

[Chorus]
They wanna see me dead, put prices on my head
Spreading rumors around town, like I fell down
They can't hold me down, they can't stop my shine
They can't block my grind, shawty, it's game time
Piru for life, branched off the Elms, nigga
I ain't big on lick 'cause I ain't been to the motherland
Here I stand, grown ass man
Gun in my hand, I don't fear no man

[Verse 2]
These niggas say they killed me and kidnapped my daughter
I ain't even got no daughter, they mad 'cause I'm a baller
And they hoes a caller, you know that I'ma stall her
Then dick her and ball her, then never ever call her
Grind hard like my mother, I'm the problem solver
AR or Revolver, you hard, then I am harder
Stop acting like a killer, you pussy ass nigga
You ain't one to murder, that's why I'm still alive nigga
Bricksquad

[Chorus]
They wanna see me dead, put prices on my head
Spreading rumors around town, like I fell down
They can't hold me down, they can't stop my shine
They can't block my grind, shawty, it's game time
Piru for life, branched, off the Elms, nigga
I ain't big on lick 'cause I ain't been to the motherland
Here I stand, grown ass man
Gun in my hand, I don't fear no man
They wanna see me dead...
Spreading rumors around town...
They can't hold me down...
They can't block my grind, shawty, it's game time
Piru for life, branched off the Elms, nigga
I ain't big on lick 'cause I ain't been to the motherland
Here I stand, grown ass man
Gun in my hand, I don't fear no man
