[Intro]
Yeah, I definitely fuck with Brick Squad, man
Real talk, man
Gucci, I got you
Frenchie, I got you
Wooh, I got you
Flocka

[Verse 1]
Mentally ill, please, someone call a doctor
9-1-1, it's emergency, go get a doctor
You don't know by now? Boy, they call me Waka Flocka
I got a bad habit, I might O.D. off yoppers
Whole bunch of choppers for my enemies
Devil entered me, my mind on injury
I'm in front of the jury like I'm guilty
Shawty tried me, so I killed them off, GP
Mom, I'm sorry, I can't let you bury
Don't worry, just commissary
And some letters plus some phone time, momma
What's the golden rule? Don't turn on my partners

[Chorus]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs

[Verse 2]
I heard a lot of niggas dissing me, they let me know they missing me
I been down for some months, now it's time to make history
With these evil ass thoughts, it feel like Satan just entered me
I'ma pull through this shit, I don't need no nigga to pray for me
I was told to calm down and spit my pain on the mic
I dropped one mixtape, six months later my career took flight
"O Let's Do It" got 'em hype, "Luv Dem Gun Sounds" make them fight
I go "Hard in Da Paint" you can tell that on sight
I'm the mixtape prince, ain't no nigga fucking with me
I'm from Clayton County, Riverdale, but born in New York
North side Queens, to be exact, Brick Squad, we a wolfpack
I can taste these niggas' flesh, I can smell these niggas' fear
Riverdale, Flocka

[Chorus]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs

[Verse 3]
They say a man shouldnâ€™t cry, but sometimes, that shit hurt
Why they put G-Baby's face on a T-shirt?
Neek, I know it hurt, that's just God at his work
Lord, all the real niggas living in the dirt
I'ma ride, I'ma ride every chance a nigga get
I'ma squeeze, I'ma squeeze, I'ma let my gun rip
R.I.P. Trav, on some real nigga shit
Real nigga clique, I'm on my Brick Squad shit
One lousy-ass bullet can't fucking stop me
I feel like Rocky when he fought Apollo Creed
I'm a certified G, Waka Flocka too street
You can call me Concrete, raised by Grove Street

[Chorus]
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma ride, I'ma ride, I'ma live, I'ma live
I'ma die, I'ma die for my motherfucking dogs
I'ma rob, I'ma rob, I'ma steal, I'ma steal
I'ma kill, I'ma kill for my motherfucking dogs
