[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tattoos on my body, that's what's banging, nigga
In the club, drinking, smoking with the gangsta niggas
Fucking with your homeboy's bitch, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Snitched on your main dog, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Tricking off everyday, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Selling dimes and nicks, flexing like you got the bricks
Lying ass nigga
That ain't gangsta, nigga
In the club with the bangers, that's what's banging, nigga

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Brick Squad shawty, get a black mask and black gloves
Don't give a fuck, shoot a nigga's ass in the club
Shout out to my nigga Murda
Them white folks trying to give my main dog murder
Waka Flocka, nigga
On that murder-man shit, might empty out
What you talking 'bout? Dump on the fucking crowd
Hundred-round shit, I'ma let this bitch rip
Twelve sirens on fuck it, I may flip this shit
Hoes up on my dick 'cause my chain hella bright
Waka Flocka Flame, shawty got the sunlight
Them that headlights, the way my diamonds shine bright
Codeine with the Sprite, that'll have a nigga slow
When I hit the club, you know Flocka got the glow
Rock every show, bought the drugs, my dick in blow
Shawty, keep sucking
Waka Flocka Flame, I ain't taking shit for nothing

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tattoos on my body, that's what's banging, nigga
In the club, drinking, smoking with the gangsta niggas
Fucking with your homeboy's bitch, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Snitched on your main dog, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Tricking off everyday, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Selling dimes and nicks, flexing like you got the bricks
Lying ass nigga
That ain't gangsta, nigga
In the club with the bangers, that's what's banging, nigga

[Verse 2: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm in all black like it was seven-four
Big strap, Glock 40, ain't no Calico
But where's your Teflon? I'm a fucking gun
Young niggas going crazy where I come from
Everybody tatted up and got them covers on
Gangbanging, man, the only thing that's going on
Me and Waka in the club, drinking on Patr√≥n
Rolling kush by the zone, getting our gangsta on
Got the club going crazy, finna lose they mind
Bitches shaking ass, niggas throwin gang signs
Niggas slick hating, looking at the ice
Hit the lights on you, bitch, I done fucked her twice
And I don't drink Coronas, I bought it for a purpose
Smash it on the surface, boy, don't make me work this
With all that hanging, nigga, you ain't no gangsta, nigga
We getting money over here, that's what's banging, nigga

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tattoos on my body, that's what's banging, nigga
In the club, drinking, smoking with the gangsta niggas
Fucking with your homeboy's bitch, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Snitched on your main dog, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Tricking off everyday, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Selling dimes and nicks, flexing like you got the bricks
Lying ass nigga
That ain't gangsta, nigga
In the club with the bangers, that's what's banging, nigga

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
What's my section, what's my gang? South [?] Piru
Whole click Damu, screaming out su-woo
Red killers, red scraps, red chucks and red hats
Red flag, burgundy flag, lime flag, what's popping?
Waka Flocka Flame in the club, shawty, bottle popping
Kush-smoking, pill-popping, looking for a model
So the bitch can swallow me and Throw-B
Dicking down bitches, nothing to me
Sell it by the O-Z, never flipped a key
But I got the bales, it ain't hard to fucking tell
Never been chill, always been a real nigga
Hit Squad shawty, I might kill a fuck nigga
Signed to Warner Brothers, so you better warn that nigga
[?] running rap, call me Flocka Jigga
ABC rapping, ass coco trapping
Waka Flocka Flame in the booth, straight snapping

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Tattoos on my body, that's what's banging, nigga
In the club, drinking, smoking with the gangsta niggas
Fucking with your homeboy's bitch, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Snitched on your main dog, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Tricking off everyday, that ain't gangsta, nigga
Selling dimes and nicks, flexing like you got the bricks
Lying ass nigga
That ain't gangsta, nigga
In the club with the bangers, that's what's banging, nigga
