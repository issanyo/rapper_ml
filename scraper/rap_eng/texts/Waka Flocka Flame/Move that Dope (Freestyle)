[Verse 1]
Waka Flocka Flame in a trapping hall of fame
I'ma ball-a-holic man
I'm calling shots, you calling names
I've been rich, homie, some type of way
I'm stove top, y'all microwave
Take my time, so respect the grind
You've seen the threats, my set'll ride
Their song pies like a bakery nigga
You telling lies, you faking nigga
I'm getting love, you hating nigga
I've seen your shows, they're faking nigga
When you get real, you get the best deals
I run way though, treadmill
But yell a bitch and I'm fast wheel, and all my published checks ill
So I burn and chill, and burn and will
And I can give a fuck of somebody's feeling
I got work to play
I got worth a play
Hustle nigga, you gonna learn today
I'm an underpaid, don't turn away
When I talk to you or the burner spray
Let's box it out, I'll beat your ass
I see the snakes, I like the grass
What chu' know about flipping bricks?
Cut the thangs in to chicken strips
Hit the strip, stack the cash, count the money, do the math
I'm going back to the trap
I'm too real, too cool for rap
I'm going back to the trap
I'm too real, too cool for rap
