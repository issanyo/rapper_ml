[Hook: Wooh da Kid]
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot

[Verse 1: Wooh da Kid]
It's a foul odor coming from the back porch
Not the Ghost Rider, but I left his ass torched
Left him burnt in the back with his Glock on him
Caught him slipping 'cause you know I had to drop on him
From his little chick daddy call his main squeeze
She ain't praying to the Lord when she's on her knees
Top shottas don't fuck with no rude boys
No, I ain't Santa Claus, but I got lots of toys
He was in the back, blowing on ganja
He fucked up 'cause he have marijuana
This was a old beef, I guess he thought the beef was dead
"And we don't know who did it" is what the paper said

[Hook: Wooh da Kid]
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a phone call, a nigga stole a whole brick
Oh shit, squadded up, call the whole click
I'm finna let my pistol whip, pistol-whip a bitch
I got a head shot, shawty, I'm finna shoot the bitch
Fuck the cops, murk this block, we gon' shoot it out
Where the green flag, shawty? I can't go without
It's a drought down south, I'm charging twenty-six
Go a couple states up, charge thirty-six
My dope the sickest, make them J's breathless
I'll snatch your necklace, car squeeze, breathless
I'm on that trap shit, slab, rock, rap shit
I'll holler, "Flocka wants the girls", start flocking quick

[Hook: Wooh da Kid]
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot
Stay low to the floor when I'm in the spot
Everybody on the floor, I'ma lick a shot
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Midget jumping out my bag, it's a hundred shot

[Verse 3: Wooh da Kid]
Licked a shot for my moms raising five kids
Five boys, no pops, they some bad kids
It's in my bloodline, everybody cut throat
My moms got shot, but the nigga got smoked
In '94, I had had my mom's 25 strap
Coming for your lunch money and we taking snacks
Moved to Atlanta, Georgia, back in '99
Scruff McGruff-ass niggas screaming, "stop the crime"
Real killers get it done, they gon' lick a shot
Never told on a soul, I am what you not
If you wanna jack, I'ma give you what I got
Lick a shot at the cowards tipping off the cops
