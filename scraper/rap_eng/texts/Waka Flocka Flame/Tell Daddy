[Verse 1: D-Roc of Ying Yang Twinz]
Lil' Mama tell daddy what you want, I got you
I'ma get a big bottle of Grey Goose
You can get loose, shake that ass for me
Get you some Fireball, and you fell in love
Me and you can have the club on fire
Me and you'll drink some Jägermeister
If you want it, you can have it
All you got to do is tell daddy

[Hook: Maejor] (Female Vocals)
Hey girl, tell daddy
(You know I need a bottle when I walk up in the club)
All you gotta do is, tell daddy

Yeah, tell daddy

(So what'chu saying girl?)
Baby tell me what you need you know I got it

Tell daddy what you wanna do
You know I'm buying one for me and getting one for you
You know I got the top floor with the city view
I'm that nigga, I can make your dreams come true
Oh, they say money can't buy love, but we can try
Oh, that sexy dancing got me open I can't lie
You deserve it babe (you do)
Tonight you look perfect babe (you do)

[Verse 3: Kaine of Ying Yang Twins]
Hey lil' mama, you swag got sauce
Only queen bees get to step to a boss
Let me whisper in your ear, like
I'm in the front tryna see what that rear like
Damn! Shawty got ass
In the club popping bottles like the mall pop tags
Ain't nobody in the clique got ass
She bad, she bad
She bad, but she mediocre
Ain't gon' let nobody feel it so I let her come over
Big girls in the club need love too
Ying Yang let 'em in, that's just how we do
E'rrebody on pot like
E'rrebody in the club have a good night
Ain't nobody get shy, ain't nobody fight
That Patrón got me thinking what she fuck like

[Bridge: D-Roc of Ying Yang Twins]
We can party like rock stars all night long
You dance to your favorite song
If you really want to get it goin' on
We can get a bottle of Patrón, blown, blown, blown
J quit it don't wan't the party to stop
We can get a bottle of Ciroc
If you want it, you can have it
All you gotta do is tell daddy

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
We gon' party all night, turn up!
I came to have a good time, put your bottles up!
Bad bitches to my right, bad bitches to my left
Hell yeah, I'm fucked up with the alcohol breath
Aw, shit.  Here come the Flocka verse
All you birds chirpin', gettin' on my nerves
I just want to blow herb and get on your curves
More money, fuck problems is what I prefer
I'm the realest nigga in this bitch, point blank
She on her period, I text "disappoint face"
She wanna get to know me though
No emojis ridin' on this rodeo
Them hoes come and go, money is the motive though
Account's overdrawn, I got overflow
I never did a sober show, never overdosed
I'm out of states, overseas, and I'm coast to coast
Let's have a toast to both, hope you takin' notes
And if her boyfriend in, he get a broken nose
I'm smokin' on some potent dough, what the fuck it
Order 20 more bottles keep pourin' it
(Flocka!)
