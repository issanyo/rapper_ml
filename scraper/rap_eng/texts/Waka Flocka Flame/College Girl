[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame x2]
I was told if you hustle
It'll pay off
Real nigga can’t go soft
Shining hard with the lights off
Grades high and she drop it low
Bad as hell and she fuck slow
Our connection on a different level
She educated in ghetto (Oooo)

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be doggin' em, I be doggin' em
Make you feel like a star
Start recording em'
Bands I got that, always poppin em' (Flex)
Put a fund in and now these niggas watching him (Well you know)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Feel like paradise when I’m in the O
Wanting moe tryin to hide my feelings but its visible
Drunk as hell on pink moe
Man I had a show in Chicago
Fast as hell but she fuck slow
Bad as hell but she fuck slow
She get money don’t need a pole
She a secret type, don’t let you know
Her body language so sexual
Like a beach show when she walk by
Leave close eye, corner man no boat tight
This kind of girl got my nose open
All I want she let the sheets soaking, wet
We stay down grinding hard for this chick
You know I was born to flex

[Verse 2: Quez]
Okay shawty educated, but lil mama from the hood
And she got a good job, man lets get that understood
She got a beamer with some rims,
She fell in love with him
But she come to my crib
And I get that girl on film
She get high, her grades high
Drop it low and she out the door
Not because she got to go
We low on rubbers, she got some more
She came back, she hit the weed
We fucked twice, then hit the three
Them big tits, them double D's
Man smart girls, cause big is freeze
