[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I go HAM when I ball, I'm in and out the mall
I get sues going HAM, spending bands on a broad
I go HAM in the trap, you know I got it all
Purple haze, lemon kush, I go HAM with the ball
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin & Derez De'Shon]
I go HAM with them hammer tips, throw ham on my sandwiches
Figure-eight on Cambelton, flashing like an ambulance
Meet me on G5, you know I be fly as fuck
Outfit blue, flag red like a fire truck
Brought the whole clique with me, club owner sick of me
VIP, getting brain, she call it chemistry
Teflon Slim, got me feeling like I'm bulletproof
Bad bitch with me, moon shining through the sunroof
Told her stop staring 'fore I dunk her in my dunk
Beat that pussy up like the speakers in my trunk
She hopped in the car (she already know the deal)
But she don't know (she going back to the crib)

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I go HAM when I ball, I'm in and out the mall
I get sues going HAM, spending bands on a broad
I go HAM in the trap, you know I got it all
Purple haze, lemon kush, I go HAM with the ball
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
I got hoes going HAM when I step up in the club
Fuck the VIP, I'm in the crowd with the thugs
Hood bitches love me, they know I go HAM
Beat that pussy like a caveman, you know who I am
Red and white polo, strawberry and creamy
Fuck up out of Lenox, call me Mr. Neiman
All red and turned up, cranberry poison
Different flavor hoes, I'm talking all kind of choices
Caramel, cherry red, Hershey's Kiss, darker
Freaks that love wood, deep thirty like an option
Sippin' out a cup, bitch I'm drinking out a bottle
Way past tipsy, ugly bitch look like a model

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I go HAM when I ball, I'm in and out the mall
I get sues going HAM, spending bands on a broad
I go HAM in the trap, you know I got it all
Purple haze, lemon kush, I go HAM with the ball
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I go ham, no pork, eat 'em with a fork
One hit wonder, what the fuck y'all niggas thought?
HAM in Neiman Marcus, go HAM in Prada
Slim Dunkin, D-Bo, lil shawty that's my partners
Every Tuesday night, you know I'm in Perfection
Go HAM with them Jacksons, go HAM with them Franklins
Fuck these niggas thinking? hey shawty what you drinking?
Whole lot of flexing, ice Wayne Gretzky
I wispered in her ear, lil shawty what it do?
They call me Waka Flocka, what about you?
Club night drunk, plus this motherfucker crunk
Ya'll can't fuck with me, or my little brother Dunk

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
I go HAM when I ball, I'm in and out the mall
I get sues going HAM, spending bands on a broad
I go HAM in the trap, you know I got it all
Purple haze, lemon kush, I go HAM with the ball
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM
I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM, I go HAM
