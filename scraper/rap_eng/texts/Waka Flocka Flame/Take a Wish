Waka Flocka Flame, when them girls hear that name
They get buck and off the chain, man, you got to see these girls
I think they like the way I swag , catch me with a duffle bag

Tell the haters kiss my ass, tell the cops suck my dick
I'ma keep on selling dope 'til a nigga filthy rich
Sike, I'ma rap 'til I'm big like Mike
Have the crowd so hype, make they ass pass out
In the club, blowing loud, then that shit got me dizzy
They don't wanna be me, they can't really see me
Stop acting like a groupie, I'm the lightskinned Gucci
Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, we move units
We the down south G-Unit, man, my swag so sick
Ask your bitch 'bout this dick, man, my swag so sick
Ask your bitch 'bout this dick, man, my swag so sick
Ask your bitch bout this dick, Waka Flocka Flame, bitch

Y'all niggas [?] better salute me, man, or shoot me
For real, man

This me, man
This Flock, man
Real talk, man, I'm a man
Y'all can't see me, man
What's up?
This is easy, man, I've been doing this six months
First time ever rapping, man
Like, I'm better than niggas doing this shit twenty years
Fifteen years, five years
I'm just [?] my life
This my life, man
I'm just rapping my life on paper, on pen and paper
That's what niggas told me
Just rap about what the Hell you wanna say
Write down on the paper
Say it on the mic, then, aye
Emphasize that shit
Put some expression in that bitch
Tell a nigga how you feel
I got a new record deal
Like, I work for mill
Like, nigga, fuck with Flocka, man
I'm gone
