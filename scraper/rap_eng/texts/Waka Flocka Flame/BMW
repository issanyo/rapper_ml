[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
This shit hard as fuck, uh, uh
Got them young niggas, got them young niggas
Fourteen years old, he gon' hurt a nigga
Got them young niggas

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
You can tell she drive a BMW 'cause her body made wrong
You can tell that rapper lame by the way he sound up on that song
Boyshorts and thongs, that's gon' turn a nigga on
And I'ma throw this cash, let me see that tattoo on your ass
I'm like swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard
Swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Bow! Bow! Get your check up
Bow! Bow! Get your check up
Hold up, bitch, balling, swish
Hundred round, chopper can't miss
It's fake, nigga, fuck Chris
Love the money, give me kiss
Yellow diamonds got my wrist on piss
Make your bitch hold my dick when I piss
Make a pussy nigga fight my fists
Damn near every nigga's bitch insist
Brick Squad change bitches like we change drawers
Got all y'all nigga's hoes in the missed calls
Same nigga will get your whole crew slumped
Got the swag that will give your hoe goosebumps

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
You can tell she drive a BMW 'cause her body made wrong
You can tell that rapper lame by the way he sound up on that song
Boyshorts and thongs, that's gon' turn a nigga on
And I'ma throw this cash, let me see that tattoo on your ass
I'm like swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard
Swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Excuse me (hold up)
Baby, I don't need no cup
Bought twenty bottles of [?] just to shake it up
Hold up
He putting ones in his pocket
Throwing bands got these stripper hoes hostage
Roll up
Smoking back to back, I'm balling
Tip the waitress 300 'cause her ass poking
You can tell what she driving 'cause her body made wrong

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
You can tell she drive a BMW 'cause her body made wrong
You can tell that rapper lame by the way he sound up on that song
Boyshorts and thongs, that's gon' turn a nigga on
And I'ma throw this cash, let me see that tattoo on your ass
I'm like swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard
Swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Swag, swish, balling hard like I'm 'posed to
Y'all niggas just spending them [?]
Got hoes dragging balls like Goku
Your new bitch, my old news
Body made wrong, crash dummy Bimmer back
FEMA in the club, I think I just brought Katrina back
Look at you, now look at me
Out of town, they quick to me
Flocka Flame, Peter Pan
Dirt Gang, Captain Hook, and me
Catch me sliding in your bitch like Tokyo Drift
Blunts long as totem poles, that's Pinocchio, pimp

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
You can tell she drive a BMW 'cause her body made wrong
You can tell that rapper lame by the way he sound up on that song
Boyshorts and thongs, that's gon' turn a nigga on
And I'ma throw this cash, let me see that tattoo on your ass
I'm like swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard
Swag, swish, ball hard, swag, swish, ball hard
Swag, swish, ball hard
Bitch, I go hard
