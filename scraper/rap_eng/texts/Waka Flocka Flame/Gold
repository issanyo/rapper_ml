[Verse 1: Jake Reese]
Got me losing control
Like a fool, like I'm mad
Cause I'm caught in the middle with you
Want it all, want it bad
Need it more than the little

It's getting realer, yeah I'm ready for your crazy
Take me high, lift me up till I'm faded
I know you're poison but I gotta gotta taste it

[Pre-Chorus : Dash Berlin]
You burn on my skin
But I'm in love with your chemicals
My good side is losing
We go hard like we're animals

[Chorus : Dash Berlin]
Ooh tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow
You burn on my skin
But I'm in love with your chemicals
I'm in love with your chemicals
Oh, tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow
Oh, tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Step up in the party like me halluh
If you ain't living then you dying, that's my motto
The sun goes down (you know)
The moon come up (yuh)
Everybody gets lit (we lit)
And the room fills up (Yeah)
All the money that I made
Don't compare to these memories
Let's live a life with no enemies
It's the purest from of living free
WAKA

[Verse 3: Jake Reese]
They say that I'm lost
I don't care, I don't mind
If I go down I'd rather be high
If this is bad, I don't wanna be better

It's getting realer, yeah I'm ready for your crazy
Take me high, lift me up till I'm faded
I know you're poison but I gotta gotta taste it
(taste it)
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus : Dash Berlin]
You burn on my skin
But I'm in love with your chemicals
My good side is losing
Yeah we go hard like we're animals

[Chorus : Dash Berlin]
Ooh tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow
You burn on my skin
But I'm in love with your chemicals
I'm in love with your chemicals
Oh, tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow
Oh, tonight we're making gold
Watch how we glow
Watch how we glow
Watch how we glow
Watch how we glow
