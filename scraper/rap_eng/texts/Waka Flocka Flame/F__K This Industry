[Chorus: x2]
Fuck dis industry
Bitch I'm in these streets
Fuck dis industry
Bitch I'm in these streets
Fuck dis industry
Bitch I'm in these streets
Lord take my back da devil entered me

Lord take my back da devil entered me
Fuck dis industry
Bitch I'm in these streets
They say tears is pain
I call it bullshit
Cause when I'm finished cryin'
I'm back to this bullshit
I got a full clip from my enemies
They wanna see me dead
Off these fuck streets
I drink this fuck liquor
You know the remedy
Waka flocka flame
Ain't no endin' me
Shout out to my momma
Man she got my back
Man I love my family
That's a fuckin' fact
Fuck this industry
I mean that shit dawg
Waka flocka flame
Man I want it all
I can't trust myself
So don't trust me
I can't trust my friends
Man they set me up
Back to this bullshit
Man this industry full of bullshit

[Chorus: x2]
Damn I miss my brother
They wanna see me under
Disrespect my mother
You gon' met my brother
Damn K.K. that shit fucked up
25 to life he did it to defend his life
Shout out to my grandma
For all them ass whoopin'
That shit made me tough
No more ass whoopin's
Shout out to my three uncle they showed me how to ball
For Dad all my life I gotta have it all
Shout out to my aunties for their female love
They showed me how to cook and clean and show a woman love
Shout out to my nieces, cousins and my nephews
Man I love my family
The Lord gon' one day bless you
Momma don't cry we gonna get it
And we do it again
We gonna show 'em that we got it
Fuck dis industry
Bitch I'm in these streets
They don't want shit
But my money

[Chorus: x2]
