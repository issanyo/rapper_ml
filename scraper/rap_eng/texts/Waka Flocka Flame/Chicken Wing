[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shit, I'm trying to tell my young nigga man
Them niggas you growing up with now G'd up, man, when you grow up, they gon' be some pussies
9 times out of 10
Squad

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm just chilling in the Dale
Smoking out a bale, trying to catch the next sale with my digital pocket scale (Work!)
Cell phone doing numbers, I got great clientele
Yes, a nigga strapped, it ain't hard to fucking tell
I'm from Riverdale, one swang, all swang
Cartel in the kitchen, watch him do the chicken wang
My clothes smell like dope cause my dog cooking 'caine
Nigga, where I'm from everybody gangbang

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Thugged out since a jit
Snot nosed nigga in a jet, fucking with the baddest bitch
Niggas know about me (What's happening?!)
Waka Flocka pull up hanging out the window, screaming "Bow! Bow! Bow"
Niggas better duck. Bow! Bow! Bow!
Cars fucking flipping
Caught the nigga slipping at the corner store eating a box of chicken
[?] my religion
Barrel in his mouth make the hollows tongue kiss him (Mwah!)
Better him than me
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me cash rule everything around me
Welcome to Riverdale, Clayton County

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
My homie cooking caine, my other partner bagging 0's
When I hit the interstate, I put my bitch on the road
Pull up straight dumping if you ever owe me
Leave your shit shot up, like Holy Moly
20 packs, 50 packs, I mean a lot of packs
Handguns and choppers, I mean a lot of straps
Money coming up short, what the fuck is that?
That's the type of shit that'll have you laying on your fucking back
I'm walking down the white brick road, for real though
? That's the plug from Mexico
Now I'm shining, I'm stunting on you haters
Monopoly boys, we about the paper

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
