[Waka Flocka Flame: Hook]
For the money and the power
Some are sellin', so turned on they friends
All for the price of dope, but I bet that won't work
For the money and the power
We risk it all, lose at life
Get locked up, won't learn shit
Come back harder, do that twice
For the money and the power
The game of life, will I win?
Roll the dice, If I lose
Blow my ashes to the wind
For the money and the power
Power of my pen, tell my friends
Fans and family that this year I'm goin' in

If I die tomorrow, go and look over my family
Friends' fans can't judge 'bout grands
Lost two good friends last year
Stressed out, can't help myself
So I resort to weed plants
Waka just stay down, right until the end
Ain't nothing I can do, fail who? Not death?
But I'm scared to fail, put a plan together, turn it up
Then I changed my dream, created a team
Locals tryna intervene, Malcolm X attitude
Shorty, I gotta get it by any means
God bless me and my enemies
Diamonds on my neck and I freeze
I stay cool in it, I'm so low key
Behind tents in a caged through fence
Blow heaven scent all around accents
G Mack when the money stacked when I actin' magic
Niggas in the hood not snitchin'
Why no police missions
The white folks dominated prisons
My voice been the hood uplifting
My best friend, why you had to take him
Niggas done trade they mamas

Power of my pen, tell my friends
Fans and family that this year I'm goin' in

I was like Waka, why you turned your back on Louie ass nigga?
Where the friendship at?
I was the one that put the hood on the map
Shit got hard, put the hood on my back
I earned my spot, that's a known fact
Push up once you're here on my back
I'm the bull, I'll snatch your flag
Down south nigga with the upmost swag
Real nigga now leavin in a body bag
Where Claiko at?
Wish I could bring shawty demuas back
Where farmies at
Wish I could bring Kyley Giben back
I'm a grown ass man, that deep shit wet
Never switch sides, never turn your back
Never testify, never put up your rack
The game of life, will I win?
Platinumed up, all on my pen
Never would I ever trap again
The street life, my friends just they trapped in
Robbin' stealin' traffickin' and they did it
