Heard he talkin shit but this ain't what the fuck he want
Locked my CEO up

Aka young drug dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft

Bustin down bricks wit that chick you fell in love with
We on that thug shit give a fuck about love I'm cruel bitch
Keep my money on my mind not you bitch
Everyday shawty pull up in a new whip
In the trap shawty said he need another one
Told em call lil waka and he said"WHAT THE FUCK U WANT"
Pull up in the dump followed by a yellow one
So icey feddi gang pussy keep them tommy guns
Chorus [x2]
