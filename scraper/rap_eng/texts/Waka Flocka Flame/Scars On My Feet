[Intro: Stephen Marley]
The revolutionaries...
Ya know? (Ya know...)

[Chrous: Stephen Marley]
Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Gained lot of scars walking on this road
Had my share of problems, only God knows
I came from kicking doors to a million records sold
I'm a platinum artist but my wrist gold
Rather it's my freedom than to live broke
Still top swinging in this black Ghost
Tell the dealer give me mounts with no mirrors
Only looking forward, what I gotta look back for?
Cause the past 20/20 when it hindsight
Can't see these [bitches] in my blind side
Only smoke the best to keep my mind right
Cause [shit] can get sour when you're in the limelight
Used to be apartments now I'm sleeping in a mansion
Now I'm doing shows, baby dropping out them panties
Got it on my own, never had nothing handed
If you ain't come from where I come from, then you wouldn't understand it (Flocka)

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya (2x)

[Chrous: Stephen Marley]
Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I done been through the headaches and the hassles
But only God can judge me with the gavel
They say I can't rap but I can make millions
So I don't care for your opinions, I ain't asked you
I'm from south side Clayco got a tattoo
I'm a street [nigga] did what I had to
So we had to war, yeah I dabbled
Coming up wasn't easy did it gradual
Bullet scars on my body had to battle
For my life, guess this karma coming back for me
For the dirt that I did, for this fast money
Just counting callouses feet from the travel
Bounce back, what ain't kill me made me stronger
Live for today cause tomorrow never promised
Just a couple years ago we was broke (broke)
Now my bank account full of commas
(Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya (2x)

[Chrous: Stephen Marley (& Waka Flocka Flame)]
Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel (you know)
But I'm seeing change gradual (you know), I went from an apartment to a castle (urgh)
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses (you know)
Grindin' no matter what the cause is (urgh), I got a vision so flawless

[Outro: Stephen Marley (& Waka Flocka Flame)]
Ya ya ya ya ya (urgh)
Ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya
