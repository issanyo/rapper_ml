[Hook: B. Ceezy]
I love hitting the mall, I love popping tags
I love bad bitches, I love riding fast
I love automatics, I love getting cash
If a nigga disrespect, this is where he get it at
I love hitting the mall, I love popping tags
I love bad bitches, I love riding fast
I love automatics, I love getting cash
If a nigga disespect, this is where he get it at

[Verse 1: B. Ceezy]
I love getting money, I love rocking shows
I love seeing stacks, I love counting bankrolls
I love bad bitches, I love pimping hoes
Stay fresh, stay fly, man, that's all a nigga know
I love blowing loud, all I know is dro
And I love with my outfit, call it stack 'em more
Mission long when they see me 'cause they know it's going down
I love when my car be sitting high up off the ground
I love when I shine, I love when they hate
I love when I stunt to look up at these niggas' face
And they [?] when they see me 'cause they know I'm throwing stacks
Got no love for no hater if he try me for some racks
And I'm from the south side, ask about me in my city
I run like [?], some niggas ain't fucking with it
Hitsquad Taliban, I'm out here, squad up
Better put your gun up, y'all niggas can't dodge us like...

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
I'm 6'8, so you know I had to ride tall
Couldn't hoop, paint the whip orange like a basketball
Then ride with me, gotta fuck with me the long way
If I don't like you, I might slap you, catch me on the wrong day
They looking for me, shit, tell them that the wait is over
I'm sitting tall like I'm riding Yao Ming's shoulders
They say I'm hot, I'm on fire like a matchbox
I mean to bang my screen, lifting up like a laptop

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Thirty-six O's, talking a thousand-eight grams
If he try to rob for that, paralyze him like he's Superman
Three dollar Supermans got my trap booming
I'm the nigga on demand, call me Waka Flocka, man
Pistol grip chopper, man, yeah, chop s man
Spin him like a ceiling fan, shoot him like a cameraman
Money to the ceiling, man, So Icey villain, man
Itchy finger trigger, man, try me, I'ma kill a man
