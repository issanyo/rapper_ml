[Intro]
How it feel? See it's a different kind of feeling from dreaming about it, imagining it, to really fuckin' doing it. How it feel? My shit crazy man

[Hook]
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Catch a charge facing life, lips sealed nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
I'm talkin' Flocka before record deal, nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
To lose them racks, get it back, count Ms nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Made it to a OG from a lil nigga

[Verse 1]
I seen my lil brother brain stretched on the floor
Do you know how it feel, nigga?
Daddy on his death bed, died from HIV
My best friend tried to snort a whole half of key
Demons all around a nigga, killings after me
Police wanna see me locked up and off these streets
They say talk is cheap so I keep my thoughts to me
Sometimes I feel like my own worst enemy
Nigga you don't really know how it feel to be
In that hospital bed pronounced dead
Voices in my head tellin' me to fight
Momma by my side prayin' for my life
Do you know how it feel to wake up with revenge
Right side paralyzed, might not walk again
Do you know how it feel, nigga?
To get crossed by your childhood friends, nigga

[Hook]
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Catch a charge facing life, lips sealed nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
I'm talkin' Flocka before record deal, nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
To lose them racks, get it back, count Ms nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Made it to a OG from a lil nigga

[Verse 2]
Do you know how it feel to stay loyal to a nigga that ain't real
For Guc' I would've killed niggas
How you let them drugs destroy the shit we built nigga
Why you let Todd Moscowitz in your ear, nigga
I got one question, my success your biggest fear nigga
They said I went last, this my fourth year nigga
I'm still here nigga, cheers nigga
Do you know how it feel feds kick in your door
They tryna hang me up but I will never fold
My youngins sittin' patient, they just taking notes
This one for the risk takers dealing coke
This one for my niggas locked up down the road
They don't know how it feel, nigga
No parole, get denied on the bail nigga
Half my class year dead or in jail, nigga

[Hook]
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Catch a charge facing life, lips sealed nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
I'm talkin' Flocka before record deal, nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
To lose them racks, get it back, count Ms nigga
Do you know how it feel, nigga
Made it to a OG from a lil nigga

[Outro]
They don't know how I feel
How I feel, how I feel, how I feel
They don't know how I feel
How I feel, how I feel, how I feel
They don't know, nah
They don't know
They don't really fuckin' know
How I feel, how I feel, how I feel
They don't know
Flocka
