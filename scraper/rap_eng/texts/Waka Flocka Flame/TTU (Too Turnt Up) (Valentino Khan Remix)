[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame] (x2)
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Can't turn down

[Chorus + Instrumental: Waka Flocka Flame]
Turnt up!
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Too turnt up, I can't turn down

[Verse 2: Elliphant]
Too turnt up, you soundin' too turnt up
Too turnt up, and I can't slow down
Can't slow down, can't slow down
This is what I made it so I cannot slow down
Me causin' a noise, comin' in like a smoke
Imma run this club down weeknight, let 'em think they saw a ghost
Where's the motherfucking blunt, pass that bliss, left my sea
Can't turn down, when it's motherfucking me
I can't slow down, I can't slow down
Now I'm buzzin' like a gangsta trip and fall up
I can't come down, I can't come down
Now roof gon' left me trip up, trip up, crack the sky
I can't slow down, I can't slow down
Now I'm buzzin' like a gangsta trip and fall up
I can't come down, I can't come down
Now roof gon' left me trip up, trip up, crack the sky

[Chorus + Instrumental: Elliphant & Waka Flocka Flame]
Too turnt up
Turn up!
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Too turnt up, I can't turn down

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
All I wanna do is party
My head keep on spinning around
Baby girl why donâ€™t you first, dr-dr-dr-drop it to the ground
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
