[Intro]
It's my motherfuckin' birthday, man. Look at me like a motherfuckin' opportunity, not a come up man. I want everybody to have a good time tonight. Welcome to the Waka Flocka Show. (BrickSquad)

[Hook]
I came to get fucked up cause it's my birthday
Nothing in the world matter now it's my birthday
Came to get turnt up cause it's my birthday
Baby get turnt up, it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I came to get fucked up cause it's my birthday
It's my birthday, it's my birthday
I'm sprayin' champagne in the air cause it's my birthday
I don't give a fuck right now cause it's my birthday
Baby drop that ass, I'm the birthday boy
Baby shake that ass for the birthday boy

[Verse 1]
Shorty got cake in the back, I'm like what's up girl
You ain't gotta worry bout no price, it's Waka Flocka World
Girl this a squad party, we ain't worried bout shit
All we wanna do is turn up and stay lit
Pulled up in that foreign, call the whole club ratchet
Locals snapping pictures, I think they see me posing

[Break]

I can't really see  but I know I'm fuckin' geeked up
Fuck it it's my birthday

Turn up in this motherfucker til the roof on fire

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Soon as I walked in, they like Flocka turn me up
I ain't worryin' bout these pussy nigga, know that burner tucked
But I ain't come here for that, it's my birthday
Pour up that liquor (everyday), it's my birthday
Jumping up and down in the crowd like a wild boy
All through the mosh pit, pass me some loud, boy
Baby shake that ass, it's my birthday
We gon' lose our mind, fuck that shit, it's my birthday
Throw your hood up nigga, where the fuck you from
Throw your hood up nigga, where the fuck you from
This a squad party, you can put up your gun
All we do is get drunk and get turnt up

[Hook]
