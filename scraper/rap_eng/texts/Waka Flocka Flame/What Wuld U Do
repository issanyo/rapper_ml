What do you do when police kick your door
Tell everybody get down on the floor (ima shoot!)
Better have bond, and a good ass lawyer
When you step in front the judge he gon' show yo ass no love
What do you do
If a truck backin up
With pillz, and brickz and its all filled up (daaamn)
Ima turn my stove on, ima turn my scale on
Trappin with mah ruga so I'm never home alone
Dope in my nutz
Hand on my Glock
12 pullup and we
Dumpin on the fuckin copz
Ill be damned if I run I gotta get my money
Tryna get the trap jumpin like bugs bunny
South atlanta zone 3 thats my home base
Trigger finger funny, it only aims for the face
What would you do if cartel tied your bitch up
And said I need 2 hundred thousand for her ransom
Smokin kush with flocka, and my nigga kinto
Keepin finger on the trigga, like a south atlanta amigo
