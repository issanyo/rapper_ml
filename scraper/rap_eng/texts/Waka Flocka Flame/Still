[Verse 2]
Casino life, call it that
All twelve bands, I ordered that
Call her friends, I slaughtered that
I see your face, you snorted that
Let me touch your ass, what's wrong with that
You stole my swag, I started that
Acting like you thought of that
You will never go far with that
Niggas playing them funny games
Boy I'm bout my money mane
Ride up in that money train
Smile but ain't shit funny mane
Two pots
Two Pacs
Three chiefs
Three steps
Money, then the power then the respect
Boy I'm picture mane
Talking that hard in at kitchen mane
Niggas out here kinda fishy mane
Come her lil'mama what's your name
Take a ride to the hotel, motel
She said I heard you got signed for 4 mill
So real
Always on the grind
