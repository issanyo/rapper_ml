[Verse 1]
Is it me or I'm tripping? Them folks on my phone
When I talk, I hear echoes in the background, homes
Looked out my window, seen a black Tahoe
Dark tint, two guys, two black suits
They say I'm wanted for third degree swag
Drop twenty in Louis, another thirty in Gucci
Saks Fifth Shawty all I do is shop
Rollie on my left wrist would make a nigga jaw drop
Brick Squad Monopoly, this is it
The way the girl lockjawing dick, she's like a fucking pit
They say life's a bitch, so I'm fingerfucking it
With a finger condom on 'cause I don't trust shit

[Chorus]
Put your lighters in the air, put your red cups up
Blowing Backwoods back to back, I'm fucked up
Hijacking planes, three years in the game
Got the money and the fame, but ain't nothing really changed
Bitches on my dick, cell phone keeps jumping
Police out the window, man, they think a nigga hustling
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding

[Verse 2]
You want me for a feature? That's one brick
Shows going for two bricks, told her snort it off my dick
All I know is grind, go get it with it
You can tell we them bangers soon as I pulled down the brim
Where I'm from, niggas rob their kin
You can't even trust a bitch or your best friend
Riverdale, nigga, this like Compton
Our pistols always barking, my nigga, we get it popping
You can feel the tension soon as I walk in the building
'Rarri sit low to the Earth, call it caterpilling
I'ma keep it grinding, nigga, don't stop
In this industry, lames get all the credit

[Chorus]
Put your lighters in the air, put your red cups up
Blowing Backwoods back to back, I'm fucked up
Hijacking planes, three years in the game
Got the money and the fame, but ain't nothing really changed
Bitches on my dick, cell phone keeps jumping
Police out the window, man, they think a nigga hustlinh
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding

[Verse 3]
I don't care 'bout no "he say, she say"
Chase this money, love dineros like my fucking DJ
Lap full of weed, riding on the freeway
Y'all niggas industry, I do this shit the G way
I'm a boss, pussy nigga, 'bout that gun play
Self-made, triple B's, nigga, all day
Can't do it with the Glock, then get my brother K
All white diamonds on my neck, call it Lisa Raye
I'ma be okay, I don't need too much
Just a red cup and one vanilla Dutch
Put your lighters in the air if you're fucked up
Flocka give three fucks, Remy Martin, pour me up

[Chorus]
Put your lighters in the air, put your red cups up
Blowing Backwoods back to back, I'm fucked up
Hijacking planes, three years in the game
Got the money and the fame, but ain't nothing really changed
Bitches on my dick, cell phone keeps jumping
Police out the window, man, they think a nigga hustlinh
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding
I'ma keep grinding, I'ma keep grinding

[Outro]
Waka Flocka, nigga
Ain't no blackballing me, nigga
Flocka
Grinding, I'ma keep grinding
I'ma keep grinding, fuck nigga [?]
