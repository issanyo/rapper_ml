Blow blow blow

That's [?] still poppin' shots
Whippin' coke in your pasta pots
They say I fell off or I'm not as hot
Lines at my shows been around the block
Flocka choppa, let's pop a bottle
My wife a gangsta, not just a model
I'm a beast nigga, it's hard to follow
At peace nigga, eat this hollow
Been some places, I beat some cases
Dunk and KO, I see their faces
Run the play up, I see the matrices
Six numbers nigga, this shit is basic
Investing keys, make several G's
I'm on the recipe to make ecstacy
Talk in person, no texting me
You know Chaz Gotti stand next to me
Rapper diss me, I'ma let him know
Pull up your schedule, come to your show
Buy a ticket on the front row
Then beat your ass so everybody know
You motherfuckers can't play with me
Don't LOL or JK with me
Tell the truth it amazes me
To be myself I get paid to be
You motherfuckers act fake for free
So you fuck niggas stay away from me
Getting money sound great to me
Imma get these P's from A to Z
Come to your town and it's going down
Free Gucci posters all in the crowd
My smoke volume super loud
My personal is like half a pound
Did festivals all across the globe
Met a lot of people, there's a lot to know
Wanna be the man, that's a lot to grow
Nobody alive gonna stop the show

Switching the flow up, you rappers are hoe
I see you in person you act like you know us don't dap us or show us not love
Fuck all y'all
I'm still young Flock with the sawed off
Bricksquad, we a global name
For hoes and fame, you niggas go insane
Stick to the code, that's loyalty
Bring lawyer fees and royalty
Lost hella weight but I'm still eating
Hold my calls, I'm in a meeting
It's winning season, I'm getting even
Against the odds til I'm finished breathing

Pray for 'em (Pussies)
Pray for 'em (Flocka)
Pray for 'em (Flocka)

Salute Me or Shoot Me the album, the nigga's on the way
