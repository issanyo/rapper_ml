[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka!
Flocka!
Let's do it
Pills, mid, kush, purp
Hard, soft, I need that
Let's get it

[Hook: Gucci Mane (sample)]
Zone-6 polar bears never see Summer
It's Winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an athlete
Ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an ath...
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, shawty, that's my off days
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, shawty, that's my show days
Sunday, in church with my Grandma Millie
Or my Grandma Dorothy, in the trap with four deep
On that breakdown, all base, rider fight a case of my life
So many goons, make a nigga think twice, rather smoke weed than to roll dice
And the PJ's with CJ's
Song so hot, make a nigga like a replay
Spinning like a DJ, spinning like a DJ
Yo, got me spinning like a DJ
Flocka!

[Hook: Gucci Mane (sample)]
Zone-6 polar bears never see Summer
It's Winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an athlete
Ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an ath...
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
DJs lost their small stack, shit! That's not me
Get up, give it up and live it up, that's what my nigga Highlight told me
Good weed, good coke, good pills, got a nigga write a big wish
One mixtape, got a record deal
Record deal
Record deal, yup
Old lame-ass niggas ain't wanna see me make it
What rhyme with block? Glock
What rhyme with Flock? Glock
Run up on me and get shot, bitch
48 thousand on my necklace, Hitsquad niggas get reckel-less
Fab 5 niggas get reckel-less, now So Icey boys get reckless

[Hook: Gucci Mane (sample)]
Zone-6 polar bears never see Summer
It's Winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an athlete
Ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete, ballin' like an ath...
Ballin', ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Who, who ballin'? Who ballin'?
They ballin', only four on weed
We drinkin', we smokin'
We rollin', gone off that E
