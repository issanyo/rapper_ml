[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hey baby, you know I'mma turn you up
Waka Flame, I got you! You know!

[Bridge: Mia Martina]
Nowhere to run, run, run, come here right now
Here right now, here right now
There's only one thing that I wanna feel right now
Feel right now, feel right now

[Verse 1: Mia Martina]
You all over my skin, I'm anxious
Paint my body boy, I'll be your canvas
Don't talk to me, just show me your talent
Your talent, oooh-oh!

[Pre-Chorus: Mia Martina]
One look and you're mine, keep your eyes on me now
Cause when the stars align, you might bring the beast out

[Chorus: Mia Martina]
Nowhere to run, boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now
Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out
Cause when the stars align, you might bring the beast out
One look in your mind, keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Keep my eyes on you, keeping ties to you
Deep inside, I deep inside, I be inside of you
Between your thighs I woop, we gon' slide by in that coupe
We gon' weave thru all that traffic
I weigh ones, and I work magic
Too much bad shit, could end up tragic
Just attraction, no attachment
FLOCKA!

[Chorus: Mia Martina]
Nowhere to run, boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now
Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out
Cause when the stars align, you might bring the beast out
One look in your mind, keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now

[Bridge: Mia Martina]
I'll take you down, down can you keep it up all night
Up all night, up all night?
Turn around round baby give me what I like
What I like, what I like
You all over my skin, I'm anxious
Paint my body boy, I'll be your canvas
Don't talk to me, just show me your talent
Your talent

[Chorus: Mia Martina]
Nowhere to run, boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now
Cause when the sun goes down, the beast comes out
Comes out, comes out
Cause when the stars align, you might bring the beast out
One look in your mind, keep your eyes on me
Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
Right now, right now

Nowhere to run boy run, come here right now
