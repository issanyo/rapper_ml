[Chorus]
These bitches love this shit
We selling drugs and shit
Like a pharmacist
We form the mother bitch
I'm a thug lil bitch
Show no love lil bitch
We love hugging bricks
No more [?]
No more sucker shit
Keep a gun on hip
These niggas playing both sides
This that gutta bitch
I can trust my dogs
Never trust a bitch
I'ma ball on 'em
Slam dunkin' bitch

[Verse 1]
Hey why these niggas playing games?
Why they acting like they gang, bitch we know you lame
Face [?] A1, don't need no chain
Don't need to throw up a sign, bitch they know that I'm game
It's nightmare, Elm Street
Niggas running, niggas ducking, shoot that bird beak
Catch a baby when he sleep
Bitch when she going to work
Grandma when she go to church
This is war pussy nigga
Should've stayed sleeping, Godzilla in the water
I clothesline a shark
Beef to me is art
They calling me the God of War, I came to rip your heart out
Pull up on 'em personal, gotta do it surgical
Tie you up and torture you
Nigga that's what bosses do
Call your friends and call your goons
Nigga that's what workers do
I'ma handle all mines myself, it's personal
I said it's personal
Lil bitch I said it's personal

[Chorus]
These bitches love this shit
We selling drugs and shit
Like a pharmacist
We form the mother bitch
I'm a thug lil bitch
[?] bitch
We love hugging bricks
No more [?]
No more sucker shit
Keep a gun on hip
These niggas playing both sides
This that gutta bitch
I can trust my dogs
Never trust a bitch
I'ma ball on 'em
Slam dunkin' bitch

[Verse 2]
Just turned 32, subtract that by 16
Now I  charge 50 bands for a 16
I remember watching niggas on the big screen, it's takeover
Big Homie all summer 18
I just turned 32 and Big Homie Flocka dropped
[?] swerve out the crack pot
May 31st, my birth was written in the stars
They said I can't rap now they saying that nigga got bars
At 31 I seen a lot of people switch up
At 17 I learned either clip up or zip up
Project [?] I seen a lot of niggas get hit up, now link up
Bank account looking like 10 brinks trucks
They saying Flocka only make EDM music
I'm making M's stupid
While you lames looking stupid
I'm with the squad smoking Cuban cigars
Still shooting for the stars with a couple beautiful broads
Straight [?] my vision can make your girl feel good
Flockavelli 2, the numbers lookin'
Hold on, I said hold on hold on
Straight in, ha I said
Straight [?] my vision can make your girl feel good
I said straight [?]
I said straight [?] my vision can make you feel you...
Straight in...
Straight [?] my vision can make you feel me girl
Flockavelli 2, gon' do numbers like Disney World

[Outro]
Fuck it, I got it right
Squad!
I Can't Rap Volume 2
