Uh-huh, yo
Flocka, what up, nigga?
Montana

[Verse 1: French Montana]
These old niggas dead, bring the forks out
Montana Josh Smith with the Hawks out
Swiss cheese on him
I'll Japan flag your head, red beams on em
White sheets on him, it's hell on earth
God gon' help you? Nigga, help yourself first
Fuck Forbes, only thing working for us
Cut the middle man out and deal straight with the source
I've been gone for a second, streets miss a nigga
Broke with a swag or corny rich nigga
Need a fix nigga, got that white girl nigga A1
New whip, white bitch credit A1
This be the Lock Out take one

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I just met a new connect
Ain’t no stopping me, I’m the prodigy
And if you try to stop me, disrespect me
Then my young boys, they gonna cause havoc
We mob when we deep, we mob when we deep
We mob when we deep, we mob when we deep
We mob when we deep, we mob when we deep
We mob when we deep, we mob when we deep, UH

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]

Then I bounce back cooking lyrical crack
All you niggas ass cheek you run with a sheep pack (baaa)
Never been the one to talk I white sheet that
Turn my back pulled down my B hat, blaat (soo woo!)
This can't be life
I used to be a backseat driver, now I'm riding in the Maybach
(FLEX!) Couple of old friends trying to discredit me
I put on for this G-Shit honor me (Grove Street!)

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame (Prodigy)]
I just met a new connect (who you?)
Ain’t no stopping me, I’m the prodigy
And if you try to stop me, disrespect me

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Heart of a lion, body of a boxer
Mind of a criminal who just got out the box
Quality sixteen, dopamine flow
Bottle pop rap pills and moscato, uh
So many songs, I got thousands kid
Yeah your hard drive gonna need a thousand gigs
Feet up, VIP, lounging, bitch
Way I deal, not real he’s counterfeit
Get you a infamous empire state boy
The real thing are we, no joke, I’m no toy
I'm the most inglorious, notorious bastard
Don P, flocka and Montan' shit, bow!
