[Verse 1]
A dreadhead with some tats and gold, that's a thug nigga
Red rag, throw it in the air, that's a Blood nigga
Blue flag, throw it in the air, that's a Crip nigga
Black bandanna, wave it in the air for my gangster niggas
I bang for life, I bang for life, you disrespect, you lose your life
I bang for life, I bang for life, you disrespect, you lose your life
I bang for life, I bang for life, you disrespect, you lose your life
Rap beef, fuck with us, shawty, you gone lose your life

Waka Flocka Flame in Riverdale
Ask about him, they gonna fucking tell you
He roll with the wild niggas, call them Hit Squad Taliban
Riverdale Boys on Grove Street, 5750, won't lie
Won't make it one day out, this isn't that one stop shop
This ain't hip hop, grip your Glock, you will get your ass shot
If you try to trap over there and your ass ain't from over there
Oh my God, I pray for you, oh my God, I pray for you

[Verse 2]
You can't flex on me and take my stripes
Shawty, I'm a real nigga
Disrespect So Icey Boys
Shawty I will deal with you
Drug dealer, cap peeler, gang banger, street nigga
Dope whipper, chain snatcher
Crime stopper? Not me partner
Got caught with a brick, told on your whole click
That's that fuck shit
Red rag, blue rag, black rag, yellow flag
Gangbang shit
That's my chick, that's my girl
You might call her white girl
When them fiends hit that shit, hit that shit
Watch they scream out that shit
Straight drop
