[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Big Homie Flock
B.S.M

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Automatics and dice games (Flocka!)
We was getting money 'til the Feds came
Two gold chains, Big Daddy Kane
And on my clothes, you could still smell royal cocaine
Could my family have survived without cocaine?
We thanked God when that blow came
Walking through the rain without a coat
Living with a point to prove
Hope that we all make it out the ghetto
Leonardo, how I paint these pictures
My niggas so relentless, vicious
Eat your food, do the dishes
Now all your family's left with is memories and pictures
Fuck niggas, fuck bitches
Fuck niggas, fuck bitches
Get money, stack money
I wish they act wrong, even act funny
I got bitches that'll die, killers that'll clap for me

[Hook: Gepetto]
It's all about the struggle
To make it out we had to hustle
When you broke, they don't trust you
When your money right, they gon' love, love you
Friends stay first, keep your enemies close, enemies close
Cause the ones that stay by your side, they be doing the most, doing the most

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Please don't get it confused, this is rap money (Waka)
Mixed with a little street money
I'm talking 'bout them long drives, don't sleep money
Bitches walking on a blade, that dirty deep money
I was told "Don't talk, just look"
Family from the streets, I was raised by the crooks
Certified street, never raised by the book
Street educated, I can tell that you're shook, rapper
Every good girl love a hood nigga
Real recognize real, you ain't a real nigga (You know)
I'm taking over companies, signing deals
If you want to build, make a mill
Never skip a meal, keep your lips sealed, nigga
Fuck niggas, Tommy Hilfiger
If you take care of your family, keep it real, I fuck wit'cha
Boy, it's levels to this shit
I set fire to that ass like the Devil in this bitch
