My trap going ham, my trap doing numbers
My niggas going ham, my niggas doing numbers
Man, I'm going ham, man, I'm doing numbers
I'm trying to buy a Lamborghini this summer

[Verse 1: Young Sizzle]
Whip the work harder, I'ma make it bump
I got that stanky pack, shawty, yeah, that straight funk
Stupid loud pack, I let it holler out
No, this ain't a closing service, but it still shout
My trap boomed out, that's my boom house
My spot getting hot, it's time to move out
I mean, my whip stupid, but I want something dumber
I want the Lambo, but I'm a buy Slug the Hummer
Bitch, I got that check, so what the [?] a model
One thing about it, baby girl, don't miss the lotto
Triple striped swag, yeah, I rock Adidas
Please don't take me for a college boy, I keep the heater

[Hook: Young Sizzle]
My trap going ham, my trap doing numbers
My niggas going ham, my niggas doing numbers

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Young niggas this, young nigga that
Southside and Waka Flocka bringing young niggas back
Drop top Lambo wheel, man, I'ma be the shit
Check out my necklace, this shit look ridiculous
Moving pounds and shit, got this young nigga rich
Yellow diamonds, excuse my earrings, this that [?] shit
We on that Blood shit, this that young nigga clique
Down south gutta music, shawty, this the fucking movement
To them niggas rocking Polo, knock that man off your chest
I be stunting, I be flexing with them butterfly [?]
Now she choosing me, now she, now she choosing me
I'm a real top dog, getting reels of that money

[Hook: Young Sizzle]
