[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Woke up this morning, is this my last day?
My girl cooked breakfast, could it be my last tray?
Grandma died on the toilet, got me scared to shhh...
Shrink said I'm crazy 'cause I ain’t scared of shit
Little folk gone, Grandma gone
Do some music, nigga, fuck your song
Ain't talking money? Don't call my phone
Just me and mama left all alone
And I don't need no man, I can hold my own
Just me and my chrome
R.I.P. who? Be damned if you leave me out here dead and gone

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
Some my niggas broke and some my niggas dead
Some turned into snitch and some are in the Feds
Everybody’s strapped and ain’t nobody scared
Young niggas dying and ain’t nobody caring
R.I.P. (who?)
Nah, not me (no)
R.I.P. (who?)
Nah, not me (no)
R.I.P. (who?)
Nah, not me (no)
Never let a pussy nigga trick you out the streets

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Every nigga I shot, every lick I hit, for every door I kick
Every nigga that’s in my click, don’t stop 'til we all be rich
I'm a soldier, gonna stay silent, lot of young niggas who 'bout it, 'bout it
R.I.P. to the fake ass niggas who got this game crowded
I done beat them murder charges before, so I can feel Boosie
Lot of confusion when you seeing your partner dem in they trial, losing
Ain't nothing but some real shit in my heart, that's why I spit from it
Never know when my time come, ain't no sense in running from it

[Hook]
Some my niggas broke and some my niggas dead
Some ... be snitches and some are in the Fed
Everybody’s cross and ain’t nobody scared
Young niggas dying and ain’t nobody caring
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
Never let a pussy nigga trick you out the streets

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
3 niggas, 3 guns, just me with no gun
Caught slipping, goddamn not me
Lord please, no R.I.P
My face on a white tee, that’s unlikely
Lil brother down dead
Uncle, pops in the feds
So I'm bickin' back, be bool, get bread
Lord, could you pray for my enemies
The ones heart filled with jealousy
They hate on me and doubting me
Always had a cold heart no sympathy
Real nigga no industry
Real nigga raised in these streets
Me, Slim D and Alley B
My eyes stay red I got a allergies

[Hook-Slim Dunkin]
Some my niggas broke (broke) and some my niggas dead (dead)
Some turned into snitch (snitch) and some are in the Fed (fed)
Everybody’s strapped (scrapped) and ain’t nobody scared (no)
Young niggas dying (blatt, blatt) and ain’t nobody caring (blatt)
R.I.P. (who?) Nah, not me (no)
R.I.P. (who?) Nah, not me (no)
R.I.P. (who?) Nah, not me (no)
Never let a pussy nigga trick you out the streets
(Dunk, Dunk, Dunk, Dunk)

[Verse 4: Trouble]
They keep telling me congratulations
I tell them "Appreciate it, but no thanks"
Tell me that when you see me in all white and a nigga facing
The bottom of the stairs of a gat, now remember this plot
Rest in peace A.J. on the side on everything I got
And everything I ever own
R.I.P. to who? Me? Nah, never
But when I do, bet it won’t be better, no
For the nigga or for his family
Cause they coming with me
It's Trouble, Trouble baby
Trouble, Trouble’s the name

[Hook]
Some my niggas broke and some my niggas dead
Some ... be snitches and some are in the Fed
Everybody’s cross and ain’t nobody scared
Young niggas dying and ain’t nobody caring
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
R.I.P. who? Nah, not me
Never let a pussy nigga trick you out the streets
