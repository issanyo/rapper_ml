[Hook: Waka Flocka]
Headshot a fuck nigga off the reel
Headshot a fuck nigga off the reel
Headshot a fuck nigga off the reel
Headshot a fuck nigga off the reel

[Hook: Trae Da Truth]
If it's drama I got it I got it I got it
I he want it I got it I got it I got it
Tell that nigga I got it I got it I got it
If he tripping I got it I got it I got it

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
I hop out, shot fire, Clayco been down
Hundred rounds, stand down
This the G south, we don't play around
I come around they don't say shit
Moment sounds when that K spit
This Rolls Royce got a pink slip
He 15 on that G shit
He 16 on that G shit
17 on that murk shit
My young nigga gonna flip shit
This 4-5 is my sidekick
Clayco's my capital
Big rims, gold teeth
That country boy attitude
Don't make Saddam Hus' after you
Caught 'em caught 'em caught 'em slipping at the red light
Run that chain, run that ice before you lose your life
Car jackings, home invasions, it's a mess
Loyalty over royalty, in the Squad I trust

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Da Truth]
I pull up holding this choppa, bitch
If you at your place, you better get back in it
Cause the way I'm feeling I might drop your bitch
If you wanna be pussy, I'm finna jump up in it
In the Black Phantom, yelling fuck 'em
If a nigga run up on me bet I ain't going duck 'em
Better have a bunch of niggas with a hell of a jaw
If I don't beat 'em the fuck up then bitch I'm busting
Gotta FM loaded up inside this jacket
50 round, twin clips, only way i pack it
If I let them hoes fly you better be acting
Get dough motherfucker, I ain't shooting for practice
I got drug money right up under the mattress
If their heads wanted beef I'm a sell out my package
I'm the king of the streets, in the hood I'm a saint
I'm a send another nigga, fuck a letter them
If you looking for the one, I'm that nigga
You 'bout that life, how the fuck you figured
Yea bitch who strapped up? My shit bigger
This message directed let no Twitter
I've never seen shots like a bitch who domin'
All black on a motherfucker when im rollin'
Shout out to them Navy Seals with the shit I'm moanin'
On to workout, yea bitch I'm tonin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I said I swear to God I can't wait
Till the day this nigga slip
Headshot 'em off the rip make 'em feel the whole clip
Walking with a slight limp cause them hammers on deck
They gon' kill you for no check they gon' do it for respect
Throwing up the wrong set, better get your ass wet
Headshotting off the motherfucking reel
I got boys, Vice Lords, GD's, and Crips
My Belly and my Ghost came with a pink slip
What you know bout that, Flocka, Waka Flocka I'm your bet
If you raw, gang bang, play ball
For sold crack, my back ain't gotta be against the wall
Just to shoot back this hunn'ed clip
You can feel all of that

[Hook]
