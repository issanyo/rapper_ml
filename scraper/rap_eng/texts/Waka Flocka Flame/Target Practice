[Chorus:] [x2]
Fuck with your hurt, I keep that tool on my hip
And this is business, some flight
My youngest ever to step
Yelling flocka, my niggas don’t living at no runna bella
Your niggas, our niggas shouting it’s whatever

[Verse 1:]
Erase that shame, a hundred rounds
They don’t need no mother fucking aim
He come here, with me he explain [?]
Turn you in and talking punches in slow lane
It’s, it’s like a fame nigga, flocka
Pain, you mother fucking ratchers nigga
Aim, you mother fucking ratchers nigga
Can’t come in and hang with the bell watchers
Flame, this is not a game
Then you get a caskett nigga
You fuck, what you hurt
I could get you thirtytwo rest for a bird
I could get you twenty three hundred for a bird
Nigga [?]
So you better watch your words

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Fuck around with those fuck niggas
Money and all in that truck nigga
Am cashing out for them drugs nigga
And I really don’t give a fuck nigga
When am full of crowns and I’m fucking hoes
Get, get money and scoping out hoes
Think shit’s funny, it’s been wise
Get these homies in the city streets
It’s like fuck the fucking haters, niggas new stripe
Bitches on my lap, naggas klnow I clap it
And I want shoes on, [?]
You wanna strap me
Nigga would and they’re twelve feet
Cause I kill them and that all for the year
Get in commas, tug, tug down
Strapped up, no seat belts
In the  ATM, niggas try
I swear to God, they gonna need help
And am getting money, doing me, try me, sue me
I don’t give a fuck, let’s prove it
A single priority, move it nigga

[Chorus] [x2]
