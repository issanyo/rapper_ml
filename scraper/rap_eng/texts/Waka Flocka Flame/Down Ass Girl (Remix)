[Intro: Female]
Waka Flocka, are you ready?
'Cause I’m ready

[Hook: Female]
Boy, I can see that your ready
When you grab my hips, holding steady
It’s plain to see
I’ma put it on this boy like a G
Well, take me to the room and take off my clothes
No need to ask no questions 'cause anything goes
Lay me on the bed and give it to me smooth
Man, this pleasure stimulate my mind, body and soul

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yes, that is my down ass chick
She ain't gotta work no more
Rent-free, bill-free
School tuition, it's on me
Trap house running so hard
You would think that shit was on E
Pills, I work deals
I'm worth a mills, thanks to my lady
I'm certified with them babies
Try to fuck her, highway crazy
When she touchdown, when she get back
I'ma take her out, I'ma take her shopping
I'ma give her this, I'ma give her that
Jaguar, Nascar, Hotcar, yes
Gucci bag, Louie bag, Fendi bag, yes
Shawty so fresh, shawty so fresh

[Hook: Female]
Boy, I can see that your ready
When you grab my hips, holding steady
It’s plain to see
I’ma put it on this boy like a G
Well, take me to the room and take off my clothes
No need to ask no questions 'cause anything goes
Lay me on the bed and give it to me smooth
Man, this pleasure stimulate my mind, body and soul

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, I love the way you hug me
Love the way you kiss me
Love the way you rub me
Even love the way you fuck me
(Muah) Blow one back at me
(Muah) Thank you, baby
You my trap girl, you my down chick
You my bad bitch, call her Ms. Flocka
I'm the doctor, she's my patient
Let's get it popping on a vacation
Private jet, baby, any location
You call it tricking, I call it treating
You call it tricking, I call it treating
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend
