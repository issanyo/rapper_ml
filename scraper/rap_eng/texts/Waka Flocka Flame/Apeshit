[Hook] x2
Apeshit! Dummy lose your mind
Go apeshit!
I think I'm going blind
Apeshit! Break your neck, break your spine
Apeshit! Again and again!

[Verse 1: Prof]
Slap me I’m a lunatic
My mama’s so afraid of me
Someone press the panic button
Nothing you can say to me
Guerrilla style
Throwing missiles in your house
Pissing miles, Robert Child
Lose your mind - rip it out
Start a fight
Take a couple shots you could pass the pipe
Everybody know there ain’t no afterlife
Laughing halfway through the traffic light
If you got a problem that I'm losing my mind
Suicidal motherfucker
Taking two at a time
Stepping on ya and I kill ya while I’m doing a vine
Look at it and the different benefits, the ahh
Deepak your Prof I will win forever
Come drink with the king if ye ain’t scared of the weather
Single moms in strip clubs - punani tsunami
Came in the cab
I’m bout to leave in a Bugatti
AHHH! I’m only leaving when the bouncers fighting
Bodies moving
Who’s these dudes that’s in here shooting
Terrorist music, terrorist music
Panic, panic, panic, panic

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
They want that find the [?]
Get it good and finesse em out of his work shit
FN bark like a pitbull when I let it off I murk shit
Get my graveyard like a work shift
Made 50k on my worst flip
Then went to Waka Flocka
Bitch I'm famous
Need a 100 band for this verse shit
This good as long as my arm tied
Try to rob me you get hog tied
I'm from Clayco that's the Southside
Sick a dog on em like a raw hide
Bunch of real niggas on this side
Get your pussy niggas on that side
I know what they want
My boy know what I want
Send me kush like every month
I roll 4 grams in my blunt
I got life inside my trunk
Keep a chopper if you stunt
Pussy play tough if you want
You a dead man
I'm from Riverdale where them boys going ham
Blam
RIOTS
Fucking turn up bitch this real
I'ma talk about a riot
I don't give a fuck about a cop, I'll start a fire and a riot
We about to spill into the streets talking about a real riot
{​​​panic, panic, panic}​​​
