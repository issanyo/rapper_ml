[Intro]:
Big dog!
Lotta niggas running around here acting like they're big dogs man
Still ain't grown here, lil' poodle
Lil' boy-ass nigga
Stay in your lane lil' nigga
Soak up some game lil' nigga
Stay in your lane lil' nigga
Soak up some game lil' nigga
Soak up some game lil' nigga
Stay in your lane lil' nigga

[Bridge]:
Said I would pop and I did it
I just might run up a ticket
Tell 'em they need 50 to kick it
Trapping like 50 and Diddy
Used to kick doors off the hinges
Now I pull up in the Bentley
Bitch I got love in my city
And I got pussy on [?]

[Hook]:
Big dog, big dog, big dog, big dog
My paper straight like a big dog
I'm holding weight like a big dog
Big dog, big dog, big dog, big dog
Now I stay drunk like a big dog
[?] like a big dog

[Verse 1]:
Big dog, big dog
Hit 'em in the head, watch the shit fall
Running through the city like [?]
Bitch I got racks like [?]
Run up on me tripping, they gon' miss y'all
Fuck nigga, broke nigga, fix y'all
Chopper bullet coming like a guitar
Never knew a nigga make it this far
Big dog, big dog
Walking through the city like a big dog
Pull up on a nigga in a rent-a-car
Strip a nigga naked like a porn star
Big dog, big dog
Big dog, do what I wanna
Big dog blowing marijuana
We still run around, 50 bricks in Gucci's hummer
Short dread nigga was the gunner
I feed your ass to piranhas
Put you to bed like pajamas
Big dog, big dog, big dog
I run this shit like I'm congress
I'm gonna eat like regardless
Your big dog paying me homage
I'm the Clay Co Mr. Rogers

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]:
Nigga might pull up in a [?]
Elm street gang, where you coming?
Call up my dude for a new chain
Used to have dirty-ass shoestrings
Shooters on go when I tell 'em
Aiming [?]
Young [?] MAC-11
[?]
You know the code, never tell it
I got your hoe at the West Inn
Niggas looking for me like Chappo
Make that ass clap like bravo
[?] with them chickens like Rosco
Strapped though, hanging out the Tahoe
Big dog staying on my boss shit
Get your ass whacked, don't cause shit
That ice don't make you a big dog
You got a [?] like criss-cross
Fuck-nigga running out with the sauce
Maybach dropping [?] Rick Ross
Big dog, big dog
[?] gang, lil' nigga
Big dog, big dog
Stay in your lane, lil' nigga

[Bridge]

[Hook]
