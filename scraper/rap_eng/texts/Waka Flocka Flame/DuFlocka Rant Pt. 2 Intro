Kevin DuFlocka Rant, part two
Lot of niggas ain't wanna see me doing what the fuck I'm doing right now
Three years strong
See when I did this shit these niggas said I wasn't gon' make it
See when I dropped Flockaveli 1, hip-hop changed, naw' mean?
Then I dropped Salute Me Or Shoot Me, LeBron Flocka James
