[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I love to smoke Mary Jane, love to sell X pills
Drinking on this purple lean 'cause I like the way it feel
Chilling with HRC, but I'm screaming HST
Shawty, where them gangstas be? Where the fuck them gangstas be?
Love to smoke Mary Jane, love to sell X pills
Drinking on this purple lean 'cause I like the way it feel
Chilling with HRC, but I'm screaming HST
Shawty, where them gangstas be? Where the fuck them gangstas be?

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Head shot a nigga quick, fuck a hundred round clip
Goonies 'round me dangerous, jewelry on my neck and wrist
My fence cost a mansion, my teeth cost a Hummer
Riding through the 'Dale, trying to fuck somebody's mamma
I'm Hoodrich with Dunte, Waka Flocka so street
Baby, why don't you join my team called 1017?
Homie, why don't you join my team? We the new niggas
So Icey drug dealers, Brick Squad trap niggas

[Verse 2: Bama 2 Cups]
This HRC-So Icey Shit, yeah, we're known to strike you quick
Catch us in the 6, busting bricks like Karate Kid
Yeah, I move a lot of it, guallas, get a lot of it
Niggas talking shit 'bout I rob them, then I probably did
Been up on some gangsta shit, fifty mids in that 6
Give them to me, I'll move them quick, Flocka is on "Let's Do It" shit
Glock 4-0, extended clip, [?] back then, new [?]
Bring them in, bust them quick, count them ends, let's get rich

[Verse 3: Bama 2 Cups]
All them gangstas, where them gangstas be?
Posted in the trap with my Carbon 40 next to me
Stupid goon with that guard the weed
Got bitch outside, I'll sell for fee
Cross the line, they'll take the piece
They'll get you good, they'll [?]
Probably pay and [?]
You work before you start to [?]
See y'all off in my trap, you can get shot before your [?]
So I go bring choppers, I got llamas, we gon' get it in
Heard about us, stupid lit
Say they ain't got plenty bricks
So Hoodrich, we gon' hit this shit

[Verse 4: 116 Shawty]
Don't worry 'bout what I'ma do, [?] go and drop a deuce
Drop this top up on your crew, all this smell [?]
In the trap with three [?], four stacks, all profit
Thousand packs hauled off and blowing loud with Waka Flocka
Glock 40, getting accustomed, best believe we got them choppers
Head shotters, cocaine, kush and skittles [?]
Love to pop X pills 'cause I like the way they feel
[?] ain't got no record deal
