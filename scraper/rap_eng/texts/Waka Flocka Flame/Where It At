[Intro]
I don't care about no he say, she say
Chase this money, love dinero like my fucking DJ

[Hook]
Kick his door off the hinges, lay it down
Heard you got that work in this house, lay it down
Nobody move, everybody on the ground
And if a nigga act crazy, brains on the ground
Nigga, where the cash at? Where the cash at?
Nigga, where the cash at? I need all of that
Nigga, where the cash at? Where the cash at?
Nigga, where the cash at? I need all of that

[Verse 1]
How the fuck a soldier broke with a loaded pistol?
Hope them goonies get you and those hollows hit you
If our squads miss, I bet my youngins' hit you
I'm from Clayton County, bitch, I want the issue
Fuck the police, fuck the police
I say it two times, all I know is grind
Bitch I gotta shine, crime pays
You couldn't walk half a mile in these Cool Greys
Dark Rayban shades, I'm like fuck a hater
Hit a lick, hit a lick, stack this fucking paper
Amphins stay right by me, I call it my neighbor
Clayton County, Waka Flame, I'm the fucking mayor

[Hook]

Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bitch I'm busting at 'em
Out lace I'm busting at 'em, No talking, send them youngins' at 'em
Heard he got work so we in his house
Niggas know I got a pistol in his mouth
Fuck nigga, where the work at?
You a lame nigga, you don't deserve that
Don't cooperate? That's a dirt nap
Whole house, I'mma search that
Where the pounds and the t-shirts at?
This one, man, I did it for the trap
Man the male lookin back
Talk around the bullseye nigga get crack
Where the fuck D-Bo at? Dae Dae keep him strapped
I'm thinking it, with a bitch I feel like Diego
Fat boy swag like my nigga
Gotti boy for life call me roulette
You know my crew go hard
These streets we gon' rep

[Hook]
