What's up, man?
This Waka Flocka, man
Been rapping for six and a half months
Six months and 23 days, to be exact, man
Some of the craziest shit in a nigga life
I never in my life wanted to rap
Let me quote that shit now
Right now, a nigga a rapper, so it's like I'm biting my tongue
But I ain't never grow up to be no rapper
I just fuck with the gangsta rap
