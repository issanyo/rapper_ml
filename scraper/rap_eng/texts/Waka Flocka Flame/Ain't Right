[Chorus: Chaz Gotti]
I'm sick of these niggas just talkin about that life
Yo broke ass nigga just barkin ain't got no bite
I'm a trill ass nigga, you lame ass niggas ain't right
Bitch I'm certified, you lame ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm a real ass nigga, you bitch ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm certified, you bitch ass niggas ain't right

[Verse 1: Chaz Gotti]
They talkin, feel like I owe um something
Guess what I don't, oh, I don't owe a nigga nothing
Get the fuck up out my face
Fuck niggas ain't talkin bout nothing
Ya'll niggas out here starving
They really ain't getting no money
No bitches with em, they lonely
Screaming real nigga, they phony
I'm boolin' like Rich Homie
My lifestyle like Tony
I'm the king, ain't no dethroning
To the top, that's where I'm going
DG to the death of me
Dunk that my big homey (Dirt Gang!)

[Chorus: Chaz Gotti]
I'm sick of these niggas just talkin about that life
Yo broke ass nigga just barkin ain't got no bite
I'm a trill ass nigga, you lame ass niggas ain't right
Bitch I'm certified, you lame ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm a real ass nigga, you bitch ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm certified, you bitch ass niggas ain't right

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Ain't no broke nigga round my circle
Be bool, nigga talk might murk you
Rolling off a molly, blowing purple
I'm a get money nigga, yelling out fuck you
Broke nigga go and get a check
Yellow diamonds on my neck
Bad bitches love when a nigga flex
Throwin bands on my ex
These niggas ain't right, these niggas ain't right
Style on muddy, yeah I'm drinking on Sprite
G-check nigga, shout "what it be like?"
Yo big homey fool, yo hood ain't right
You a dog, niggas like you I show no love to
Young cause I love to
Open up his head for a fucking ounce or two, I'm Piru

[Chorus: Chaz Gotti]
I'm sick of these niggas just talkin about that life (Squad)
Yo broke ass nigga just barkin ain't got no bite
I'm a trill ass nigga, you lame ass niggas ain't right
Bitch I'm certified, you lame ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm a real ass nigga, you bitch ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm certified, you bitch ass niggas ain't right

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Ya'll niggas ain't right, ya'll niggas too wrong
Ya'll niggas fell off, nigga I'm too on
And my gas, too strong, and my pistol, tool on
And when I bust that bitch, swear I won't stop til ya'll niggas gone
Rex Rd. in this bitch
Turn up, turn up
Let go of this bitch
Turn up, turn up
Wrecking Crew in this bitch
Turn up, turn up
And if a nigga disrespect, let loose in this bitch
Turn up turn up
I'm D-Dash

[Chorus: Chaz Gotti]
I'm sick of these niggas just talkin about that life
Yo broke ass nigga just barkin ain't got no bite
I'm a trill ass nigga, you lame ass niggas ain't right
Bitch I'm certified, you lame ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm a real ass nigga, you bitch ass niggas ain't right
You ain't right, you ain't right
I'm certified, you bitch ass niggas ain't right
