[Intro]
I Can't Rap Vol. 2
Bodak Bellow
Bring this shit back one more time

[Verse]
Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
Ain't no Ls over here, all I see is Ws
Elevator in my mansion cause I'm living comfortable
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I don't fuck with you
Yah yah, I don't dance bitch, I make money moves
Yah yah, uncle Scrooge cause I'm swimming in money pools
When you see me in these streets, know that I don't fuck with you
I'm a magnet for the money Franklin, now I'm stuck with you
Now he say he gon' do what to who, let's find out and see
Flockavelli, Riverdale, Bricksquad Monopoly
Put the brakes on a nigga, I ain't talking minor key
Only really niggas rep the squad and they sign to me
I'm in the club balling out, throwing bands in VIP
You outside in the line waiting, trying to show ID
Honestly don't give a fuck who in front of me
Bankroll on stupid, I be where the money be
I don't argue with these lames, don't let lames bother me
In the telly with your girl smoking and she swallow me
Look, might just chill with your chick, look at the flick of my wrist
I put the dick in your bitch, pimpin' you cannot resist
I'm like okay
She know I get to a bag
Tell your bitch sit in the back, you know I'm a G
And I got plugs in your city, I get a chicken for cheap
I'm the hottest in the streets, get it poppin' in the streets
I'm a BSM boss, you don't want no parts of me
As I climb up the ladder of success, pardon me
Niggas try to play the role knowing they ain't hard as me
You a coward, you a lame, nigga you should be ashamed
I just landed on my plane with duffle bags of Mary Jane
And I just checked my account, turns out I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
Money ain't a thang baby, big pimpin' in this bitch
