[Intro]
Twin Towers came down in nearly freefall speed
200,000 tons of steel
Now, what can do that?
What, what can move mass out of the way?
Explosives
President Obama broke the news of Bin Laden's death to the country in a dramatic late night speech
The United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden
And the terrorist who was responsible for the murder of thousands
But the Navy SEALS launched a surgical strike and a firefight ensued

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
You mug me, we fighting
You touch me, we shooting
You try me, we fighting
My money, we shooting
This a, this a no fly zone
And we ain't letting shit slide home

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I ain't got no aim, that's why I got a K
And that bitch hold a hundred, no more arms and legs
Fatality, a nigga call me Johnny Cage
But on another page, I be balling, nigga
Can't afford an injury, playing hurt, nigga
I be damned if you catch me slip, drunk off of liquor
Trying to fit a 3.5 in a swisher
Call that take a picture, I'm the new guy, Fisher

[Pre-Chorus: Wooh da Kid]
Twin Towers, still standing
No fly zone, paper planes ain't landing
Bullets hit them, make them spin, I'ma burn one
We don't shoot with techniques, we just burn some

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
You mug me, we fighting
You touch me, we shooting
You try me, we fighting
My money, we shooting
This a, this a no fly zone
And we ain't letting shit slide home

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Money gets you shots down, chainsawed and smoked out
Mugging gets you beat down, fucked up and choked out
We fighting, we shooting, no license, still cooping
I'm trifling, I'm roofing, she dyking, we cooping
No fly zone, burning paper planes out
Nina got that firehead, she blow your brains out
Ask them what that chain cost and snatch your chain out
Check your wedding band, fuck it, snatch your ring off
Dunk

[Pre-Chorus: Wooh da Kid]
Twin Towers, still standing
No fly zone, paper planes ain't landing
Bullets hit them, make them spin, I'ma burn one
We don't shoot with techniques, we just burn some

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
You mug me, we fighting
You touch me, we shooting
You try me, we fighting
My money, we shooting
This a, this a no fly zone
And we ain't letting shit slide home

[Outro]
Three people detained
That includes the rapper Waka Flocka, his brother, and an employee at the business here
This all started with a shootout in the parking lot
A shootout here with multiple shots fired and one person hit
Police say that person was driven to CMCE
He was shot in the shoulder...
And eyewitnesses told me that they heard at least ten, twelve gunshots during that gun battle involving the rapper Waka Flocka
