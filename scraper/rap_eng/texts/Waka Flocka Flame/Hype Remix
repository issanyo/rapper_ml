[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
I tell these niggas “take notes man”
Niggas like “fuck graduating, I’m selling coke.”
That’s some fucked up logic man
And these hoes right here fuckin’ for new bags
Stealin’ swag

[Verse: Waka Flocka Flame]
You lame rappers
Views from a real pyru
Married to the game, I do
I’m ridin’ through in that chicken coup
Them birds (?) when I’m slidin’ through
Can’t finesse a brick like I do
You little niggas can’t walk a mile in my foot steps
Pussy we don’t wear the same size shoe
Punch him in his face, feed him chicken soup
Surgeries in that institute
Record his ass while I whoop his ass
And put it on my album as the interlude
My circle tighter than an intertube
Always talkin’ bout what you finna do
I think ya lame, (?) pinnacle
Rappers on too many chemicals
Where the fuck y’alls principles
This Brick Squad I’m the general
Middle finger grab my genitals
Why the fuck my niece in the news?
Always talkin’ who Waka doin’
Always talkin’ what Waka doin’
Countin’ money I’m thumbin’ through it
You got a problem bitch I’m comin’ to it
Pullin’ up with a couple shooters
I could give a fuck about this fuckin’ music
I’ll fuck ya up and there’s nothing to a whole squad ridin’ like a fucking Buick
I know I’m winning but I’ll fucking lose it
And beat the case cause my lawyer Jewish
Grimey nigga came from the sewage
Put them hands on ya like Lennox Lewis
Really with this shit
If you diss me bitch
Then it’s a wrap
Like Christmas gifts
It’s arithmetic, I’ma hit the lick
We gon’ snatch the bag and split the chips
Out in Colorado, go fuck with Spense
VVSs on me never tuck it in
The hate is out but the love is in
Makin’ major flips like a (?) (FLEX!)
Fuckin’ up the dope because I can’t cook
So I made a million off Facebook
So underrated feel like Westbrook
Runnin’ plays it’s textbook
Couple rappers solid the rest shook
They say I can’t rap so I came back
With them punchlines give ‘em left hooks
B-b-back from the dead I’m John Snow (?)
(?) I’m here John Doe
I feel like young scooter no convo
No snakes keep the lawn mowed
Why the fuck niggas thing they Pablo
Because they watch an episode of Nacros
This is real life tryna fuck (?)
And you lyrical niggas, catch a case now you spiritual nigga
Defense put some fear in ya nigga
What they put some years on ya nigga
Do I see a tear droppin nigga
(?) nigga
I’d take the chair my nigga
Loyalty real my nigga
Yeah (Waka!)
Fuck wrong with these niggas man
Just turn 30 man, how old do you think your favorite rapper is man?
I’ve been listening to these niggas since they been in middle school
Move over granddaddy
Squad, Flockaveli 2
Gang Gang, Crew!
