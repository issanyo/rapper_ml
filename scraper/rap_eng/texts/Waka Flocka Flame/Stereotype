[Intro] x2

I've been through so much shit
I've been through so much shit
They say I've blown up quick, yeah

[Verse 1:]

Brother dead, daddy dead, Ozzy got HIV
Lord can you please get this rage out of me
Start popping band cause this shit that I've seen
And the shit that I went through as a child
Me calling Wooh running route
Yelling when my fans go wild
Never ever let words bring me down
Broke 3 years ago, I'm rich right now
Still thinking back in the hood blowing loud
Love the way my bad bitch hold me down
Free Lil Boosie, that's my rap
Fucked me up when I heard you're on trial
? gon stand around
Souls of the streets, hope my fans will hold me down
Doing ? my dog
When you get out we gon ball my dog
Trying to maintain, ? on my chain
Do my own thing, keep this shit a hundred
Police be harassing me, cause I'm thugging too hard
Ain't no controlling me I'm down with Bricksquad Monopoly

[Outro:]

They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
(You gon need some reinforcements)
They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
(I think I'm hearing voices)
They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
They stereotyping me
(There ain't no controlling me)
Police be harassing me
Police be harassing me
Police be harassing me
But I'm a always keep it G
