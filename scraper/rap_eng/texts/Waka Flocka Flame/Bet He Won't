[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame x2]
Jump in the water, I bet he won't
Jump in the water, I bet he won't
Clique full of sharks, man eaters, grim reapers
You can shop around the town, I bet my price the cheapest

[Verse 1: Boss Top]
Jump in the water, I bet he won't
Run up on me wrong, I'ma spray your dome
Jump in the water, like whipping coke
Shoot your ass and your face, I bet you choke
Niggas all on IG like they want some smoke
Boy you better pick a side before that 50 blow
Shooters in your bushes, killers at your door
Leanin' off a 4, and I gotta roll
We ain't snaking shit, bitch we love you bro's
Boy don't be no fool, we ain't friendly though
Pull up on your youngin, let that semi go
Boy don't be no fool, (?)

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Boss Top]
Clique full of sharks and we from the go
We is from the Wic then it came the O
And we fuck with 300, 600 ho
Boy don't get Tooka'd on the bus stop, ho
Pull up smoking strap and I got a MAC
And that bitch go brrr when I cock it back
Waka that's my brother from another mother
Bitch we rap and take it like a fucking rubber
Pull up on you, FN shit gone get ugly
We don't give a fuck if this shit in public
I don't like to talk boy, it's no discussion
You know how I go, We on drillin' (?)
