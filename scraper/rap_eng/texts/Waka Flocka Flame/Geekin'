(Verse)
Trap through a half a bullet, gon break down
Just hit a lick for wrap a pit on every pound
Came up 7 O’s using half a pounds
Won’t my homeboy knock em off, it’s goingdown
Knock em off, it’s goingdown
I said knock em off, it’s goingdown
Sold em dog food, bells are rattled nigga
Flexin with me savage nigga, gotta have it nigga

(Hook)
I’m geekin, I’m geekin
Hell yea young nigga geekin

Hell yea young nigga geekin
But don’t worry, just a flash and I’m geekin
Put a lick through it, in the club geekin
Now that nigga go swappin that freaky
Just threw a quarter mill Shawty it ain’t weekend

(Verse)
My young niggas they geekin
Might catch a face, might eat yo face
My young niggas they geekin
One false move, it’s a blood pool
West gang on my hancho
Make it rain, nigga poncho
Or a back stroke
Seem to the morgue where the rats go
Summertime, you know them murders keep going round
Grab my homeboy
It’s going down
The police killed moreli, team is going down
We got the hot summer yup, it’s going down
And we geekin
I’m poppin pills and I’m keepin it trill
Fuck these niggas and fuck these haters
And fuck these mills
I’d rather die a real nigga
On bloods nigga, I own the game nigga
10 toes down, me and Waka Flocka Flame nigga
I’m the same nigga

(Hook)
And I’m geekin, I’m geekin
Hell yea young nigga geekin
I’m geekin, I’m geekin
Hell yea young nigga geekin
But don’t worry, just a flash and I’m geekin
Put a lick through it, in the club geekin
Now that nigga go swappin that freaky
Just threw a quarter mill Shawty it ain’t weekend

Hunned in the choppa, I’ll murk me a nigga
Put a hundred on the case, you really go my nigga

Couple shootouts and robberies
Most most my niggas got families

(Hook)

Hell yea young nigga geekin

Hell yea young nigga geekin
But don’t worry, just a flash and I’m geekin
Put a lick through it, in the club geekin
Now that nigga go swappin that freaky
Just threw a quarter mill Shawty it ain’t weekend
