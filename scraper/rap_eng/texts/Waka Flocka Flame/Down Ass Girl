[Hook 1: Girl & (Waka Flocka Flame)]
That's why I'm his down ass girl (Waka Flocka)
I hold his weed, I smoke his purp (Flocka)
I ride all day with my nigga work (Why?)
Pay my bills, he pay my rent (And...)
When he traps, I hold his stacks, he calls me his down ass girl

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yes, that is my down ass chick
She ain't gotta work no more
Rent-free, bill-free
School tuition, it's on me
Trap house running so hard
You would think that shit was on E
Pills, I work deals
I'm worth a mills, thanks to my lady
I'm certified with them babies
Try to fuck her, highway crazy
When she touchdown, when she get back
I'ma take her out, I'ma take her shopping
I'ma give her this, I'ma give her that
Jaguar, Nascar, Hotcar, yes
Gucci bag, Louie bag, Fendi bag, yes
Shawty so fresh, shawty so fresh


[Hook 2: Girl & (Waka Flocka Flame)]
I hold his weed, I smoke his purp (Flocka)
I ride all day with my nigga work (Why?)
He gives me this, he gives me that (And...)
When he traps, I hold his stacks, Waka, I'm your down ass girl

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shawty, I love the way you hug me
Love the way you kiss me
Love the way you rub me
Even love the way you fuck me
(Muah) Blow one back at me
(Muah) Thank you, baby
You my trap girl, you my down chick
You my bad bitch, call her Ms. Flocka
I'm the doctor, she's my patient
Let's get it popping on a vacation
Private jet, baby, any location
You call it tricking, I call it treating
You call it tricking, I call it treating
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend
Me and Ms. Flocka do this shit every weekend

He gives me this, he gives me that (And...)

(Baby!)
