I started from the bottom on my way up
Lotta niggas acting like they really fucking tough
But I know they ain't 'bout that life, they earning them stripes
Boy, that's just their height, get up all their white
I don't really think he really 'bout what he saying, what he talkin' about
Grady got me Riverdale, I really made my name, bro
Never fucking changed, bro
This one for my niggas in the chain, get throwing sets, though
GROBE, I'm so OG they know it's me
300 K running down your street, I walk, I talk, I ain't pounding
All these bad bitches around me, sold out shows all across the globe
When I'm MB more or DC, all my music just go, go
So many bitches sliding down the pole with no clothes, 'about to doze off
I mean stadium, eating fast our mills, you 200 I'm 2 mil
Keep it 200 I'm too ill
Nigga save the pot at midnight, this is just a sample for niggas who live that
The time they always show me love cause I have that
A song to live, song to live
