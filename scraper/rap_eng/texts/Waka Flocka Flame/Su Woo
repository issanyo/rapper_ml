Until the day I day, shawty, I'ma stay fresh
See, boy, I stay fresh
Your girl outfit, call that shit a hot mess
That bitch a hot mess
They holler drop shit, So Icey shout "we the best"
See, we the best
I holler su woo (su woo), them goons will shoot you in your chest
Until the day I day, shawty, I'ma stay fresh
See, boy, I stay fresh
Your girl outfit, call that shit a hot mess
That bitch a hot mess
They holler drop shit, So Icey shout "we the best"
See, we the best
I holler su woo (su woo), them goons will shoot you in your chest

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
[?] far or some offest deuces
Glam, now that's swagger
Long ass chain with some big ass earrings
Keep clapping, now that's swagger
If I pull up on your bitch, I'ma bag her
When I hit the club, watch the DJ show me love
Niggas give me daps and mean mugs, girls give me hugs
Cops equal slugs, you get drugged, you can feel my lungs

[Verse 2: Snypa Ryfle]
See, when I pull up there, they be like dang
My whip game foreign, yeah, they like my talent
Yeah, bitch, I'm so sick with it
Yep, young Coupe game, yeah, so sick with it
I'm summer everywhere, yeah, you see me everywhere
Shows in every city, three bitches, six set of titties
They know my swag stupid, man, straight through the roof
And when I come through, goons with me will fill the roof
I come the long way, fuck that hoe the long way
Give her dick the long way, and me past the launch
Big, Starbucks, I might down for a latte
You did holler what the fuck everyday is a holiday

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I go ham on a bitch like a fucking sandwich
Genie this, so take a wish, which position is this?
Beat that mouth up, beat that, beat that back out
Dreads and golds up in my mouth, I'm from down south
Riverdale in your house, mask up, run up in your house
All night bright, with the white with no appetite, running all night
Oh, my God, Oh, my God, work so hard, work so hard
Or buy two beans, shawty, where the fucking lean?
