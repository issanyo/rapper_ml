[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Life, tomorrow ain't promised, ain't that the truth?
I can see the shooters on the roof
I can hear the prayers in the gunning
D-D-DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Everybody feels the pains of life
Yes we work so hard to strive
Spending day and night tryna make it right
Create a better life
Come let's take a ride
Let music free your mind

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
No Appleton fi find, enjoy the fruits of your labor
Dance up inna the street like Trinidad and Jamaica
Tun up di music loud mek we disturb we neighbor
In it for the love, Jah mek we done out the paper
B-b-back it up, cah anuh size we fraid of
Big, you cudda small or taller than a skyscraper
Always inna di oven for you know seh man a baker
Flex like my daddy but me have me mother flavor
Sen fi Jah army mek wi lock down di acre
Bring me the kette, an di Congo shaker
Give me the makavara mek di chalwa start blaze up
Imma midnight raver

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
We just tryna live while the night's young
Too focused on the right now to worry 'bout what might come
All the stressing lately got me thinking I should light some
All that playing baby, light one
Busy Iggy, pretty girl stacking up pretty pennies
Save this chitter-chatter, ain't never mattered
It don't offend me
Say they shocked I bring this money with me, then take over cities
Turn a hard-top to a soft-top, had a re-do for them titties
Every eye on my hip and waistline, watch me whine
And they must have forgotten about me baby, let me remind dem
Everyone's a critic nowadays, never mind dem
We bring the stars out and realign dem

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
I'm getting kush, taking shots, get it started
They like, "Did you hear that song with Flocka and Stephen Marley?"
I'm doing donuts in the parking lot in my Ferrari
I love my people, I do this for my people
See the evil, why we need to be illegal?
And hella reefer, fall asleep, and wake up to the reaper
Take a leap of faith, lose the hate and love your people
I make beats and smoking doobies chillin' in Jamaica
Cross me and I'mma introduce you to your maker
I can't hear these suckers scheming, I know they some haters
You can copy the machine or make the paper
Or you could be original, reach pinnacles
Alcohol and kush, that's my vitamins and minerals
Chilling with my girl, skinny dipping in the swimming pool
I do it to the maximum, you keep it to the minimum
(Flocka, Flocka)

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight
