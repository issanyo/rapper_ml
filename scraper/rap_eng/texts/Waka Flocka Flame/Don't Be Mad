[Hook: Murdah Baby](x2)
When you see me in the hood don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the club don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the coup don’t be mad at me
Don’t be mad at me, don’t be mad at me

[Verse One: Waka Flocka Flame]
All my summer jam singers, why they mad at me?
I came up in 2 years, that’s a tragedy
We’ve been at this 20 years but he ain’t had to breathe
All them flow G call me easy fuck that E
I go hard and I bang ‘em so old key
Might OD if I keep poppin’ these
Gotta put work for my engine, don’t need a key
Got this on tied beemers on my drunken knees
You’re fuzzy on my neck, I just need a hundred thou
With me that’s the jeweler and we act like what the hoola
Iced in, ice white, iced in, iced out
Waka Flocka Flame, you know shorties bring hoes out

[Hook:] (x2)
When you see me in the hood don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the club don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the coup don’t be mad at me
Don’t be mad at me, don’t be mad at me

[Verse Two: Ransom]
When you see me with your bitch don’t be mad at me
I catch your body with my dick, she’s a casualty
That Maserati close at grip, it don’t have a key
I do pilates with them bricks, I stay traffickin’
I’m ‘bout that big kick, my birthday get a big pick
And I’m thirsty, I’mma sip bricks
On my worst day and I’m still rich
Pardon me but I’m still on
On my knees when them pills gone
Fuck the weed in that real bong
It’s hard to breathe like I’m still born
So when I’m comin’ for my chips don’t be mad at me
I spend a hundred on my wrist, yea I’m stackin’ G’s
You niggas act like Romeos, but I’m masterpiece
So when I have to squeeze that’s what it has to be

[Hook:] (x2)
When you see me in the hood don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the club don’t be mad at me
When you see me in the coup don’t be mad at me
Don’t be mad at me, don’t be mad at me
