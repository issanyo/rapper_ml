[Verse 1]
They call me Shawty Dread, better yet, Flocka
A handgun can't do it, better use a chopper
This nigga had a 30 clip and used one bullet
Next time you pull it, aim for the head
Police need a statement, I can't talk to homie
Fuck a best friend, do it by my lonely
But they can't go phony, CB4 nigga
Acting like Gusto, you super pussy, nigga
Vet here, no rookie nigga
Hood legend like Tookie, nigga
Right wrist white, blue weed, nigga
But I ain't Cripping, though
Shoot your ass from head to toe when I see you, nigga
I heard they said this-that, I heard so many rumors
I heard so much bullshit, you got a dick or a clit?
Better yet, your clique on bitch
Pussy nigga
They call me Flocka, i ain't got no lyrics, nigga
Straight blunt, nigga, I don't want no lyrics, nigga
Riding in my box Chevy
Ayy, that's my hood car, graduated from a hood star
These niggas get me mad
I don't mean to brag 30 bands, I got swag
My show fifteen bands
Quarter every month, motherfucker, let's stunt
Two chains, two rings
One Breit, one bracelet, nigga, you got Gucc to blame

[Chorus]
I throw money out my window just to front (uh huh)
Loud purp in the Swisher, that's the blunt (uh huh)
I heard I'm ugly, but you can't call me broke (uh huh)
Waka Flocka Flame, little shawty dope (uh huh)
Tay on the beat, that's them stacks (uh huh)
Hit the strip club just to watch that ass clap (uh huh)
Niggas buck, we gon' blitz him ASAP (uh huh)
This rap shit booming like this shit a trap (uh huh)

[Verse 2]
Okay, what the fuck toï»¿ say?
I got juice, nigga, I'm the truth, nigga
You could play Bishop, nigga, I'ma play Q
Elm Street shawty, I'ma die Piru
G shit here, nigga
You a square nigga, you can never fit up in my circle
Geeked up like I'm Urkel, off a triple stack
Niggas talk off white, they ain't never trapped
You can call it sneak dissing
This nigga answer back, he gon' end up missing
On my tour bus, smoking weed and fucking hoes
Waka Flocka Flame booked up, meet me at my shows
But nigga, it's a go, nigga, I'm on everything
Damn near on Hall of Fame, don't mix me for no lame
Bitch nigga, stay out my lane, you rap niggas fucked the fame
You disrespect me, I'ma put you in a picture frame
Fuck nigga, put you on a milk carton
We shooting pencils over here, no martial arting
Maserati, Martin, Bimmer, or a Benz
Passenger nobody, motherfuck a friend
Put no trust in them
I did that shit one time, almost lost my life
Crack rock, but roll them dice
I got three jobs: stunt, stunt, stunt, stunt

[Chorus]
I throw money out my window just to front (uh huh)
Loud purp in the Swisher, that's the blunt (uh huh)
I heard I'm ugly, but you can't call me broke (uh huh)
Waka Flocka Flame, little shawty dope (uh huh)
Tay on the beat, that's them stacks (uh huh)
Hit the strip club just to watch that ass clap (uh huh)
Niggas buck, we gon' blitz him ASAP (uh huh)
This rap shit booming like this shit a trap (uh huh)
