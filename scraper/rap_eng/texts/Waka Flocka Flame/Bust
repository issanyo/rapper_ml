(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow)
(Bust)
(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow)
When she go down put two fingers up
(Bust)

[Hook:]
Party too bad man the club bout to bust
Hands up form the back
Screaming "We don't give a fuck!"
Every night turnt up
Girls on my tour bus
Let her body pull my trigger
Baby you gon' make me bust

(Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow)
(Bust)

[Verse 1:]
I break you up proper
Party with Flocka
Catch me at the bar giving shots like a doctor
These rapper be actin'
Give 'em all Oscars
Beast on stage
I'm a concert monster
You talk like me then put your cups up
You turnt like me then you get fucked up
I just tell her back up it you know I'mma beat it up
When she go down put two fingers up
Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust

[Hook:]
