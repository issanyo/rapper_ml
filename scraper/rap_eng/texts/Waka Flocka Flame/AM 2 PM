[Intro]
Getting this money, counting this guap
Real street niggas, don't fuck with the cops

[Verse 1]
First thing when I wake up, get right to this money, no breakfast
Watch me like jake, 'fore I go to bed, count amount of the money, no Everest
Cause I want some new Gucci, I want some Versace, my bitch say she want some Giuseppes
So soon as hit up my ese, I get the P's off, and come play on the block, ain't no Tetris
My men from the valley, my loud came from Denver, money the first thing, that's on my agenda
Walk in the club, make it feel like September, money fall like October, could tell I'm a winner
Just look at my wrist, make it feel like December, it's covered in ice, like the middle of winter
You see my side piece, and you wish you could hit her (I fuck her tonight, and tomorrow forget her!)
No Benihanas for dinner, glasses of Aces all for dinner, since I remember
AM I get up, get this workout, I ain't talking no sit-ups, with this weed, guess you could
Call me a vendor, if I'm on then we on, I put on my niggas, by PM
I'm counting this money, my bitch said "You coming to bed?" and I told her "Ho, give me a minute!"

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
From AM to PM I keep them presidents coming
I made something from nothing
I just bought me a coupe
I pop the top with one button, ain't got no use for no roof
From AM to PM, from AM to PM from AM to PM
From AM to PM, from AM to PM, from AM to PM
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
Before I go to bed, make sure I count up all hunnids

[Verse 2]
Walk in my closet, it look like the mall, draped in designer, no keys for my cars
Walk in the club and we balling, my section got bottles I ain't got no use for no bar
My diamonds is VV, I see yours is cloudy, take one look at me, you could see ain't no flaws
These bitches they love me, they see I throw money, I make her ass give me a round of applause
AM to PM, AM to PM, I get this money from AM to PM
Your bitch she a groupie, I might fuck your BM, buy her a BM, all in my DMs
Got rich off this weed and this rap, fuck with the robbers, still hang in the trap
AM I'm spending this money so I can go re-up, by PM I'm bringing it back

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
From AM to PM I keep them presidents coming
I made something from nothing, I just bought me a coupe
I pop the top with one button, ain't got no use for no roof
From AM to PM, from AM to PM from AM to PM
From AM to PM, from AM to PM, from AM to PM
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
Before I go to bed, make sure I count up all hunnids

[Verse 3]
I finness scales, cause when everything go bad, I know it won't fail
I keep clientele, If your product one hundred, it's gon' sell itself
Make my way to the bail, trapping got weed and got bars like a jail
I started with P's now, it's trips to AZ, use ammonia to kill all the smell
Ain't shit you could tell me, I'm a real dope boy, like Tommy and 'Veli
Streets love Flockavelli, 24 hours, block rolling like Kelly
Brand new AP, that new car you driving, it cost me like three
Got it all on my own, ain't need nobody's help, all I needed was bags of some of tree

[Hook]
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
From AM to PM I keep them presidents coming
I made something from nothing
I just bought me a coupe
I pop the top with one button, ain't got no use for no roof
From AM to PM, from AM to PM from AM to PM
From AM to PM, from AM to PM, from AM to PM
I wake up in the morning and I get straight to the money
Before I go to bed, make sure I count up all hunnids
