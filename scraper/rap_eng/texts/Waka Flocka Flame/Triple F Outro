[Intro]

[Verse 1]
My partner got murked, friends turning phony
Next door neighbor trying to put the people on me
Life’s a bitch, I see a brother death creeping on me (On Me)
Pain I write it on me, watch these label’s trying to clone me

[Bridge] x 2
Pain I write it on me, Pa-Pa-Pain I write it on me
Pain-Pain I write it on me, watch these label’s trying to clone me

[Hook] x2
I’ve been going through so much, I’ve been thinking about so much
I don’t know who to trust or who to believe
A couple of friends, a couple of fans, and my family
I’m a ride until the end, ain’t no fear in me

[Verse 2]
My partner got murked, friends turning phony
Next door neighbor trying to put the people on me
Life’s a bitch, I see a brother death creeping on me (On Me)
Pain I write it on me, watch these label’s trying to clone me
Count my days and blessings, for every mistake made was a life learned lesson
Swear I ain’t flexin’, police pulled us over ‘cause the color of my complexion
And our hair style, now we standing on trial
Me against the world so I’m voicing my opinion
Did I forget to mention how they stole my momma credit
And our blue print, gave it to another nigga
Left us on stuck, got us fucked up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
December 16th, a part of me died
Part of me stayed strong but a part of me cried
Pardon me on the song while I’m spilling my pain
A part of me getting weak when they mention your name
It go R.I.P. Slim D (Who?)
Hating niggas took your life over envy (True!)
A lot of snakes in the grass lord protect me (Yes!)
When I make it to the gates don’t reject me (Yes!)
I’ve been going through and don’t know when it’s my turn (No!)
So I just sip a little and let the ganja burn
Everything I do, I do it for my family
And my heart to big to have fear in me

[Hook]

[Outro]
My partner got murked, friends turning phony
Next door neighbor trying to put the people on me
I wish I could fly away
I wish I could fly away
I wish I could fly away
I wish I could fly away
