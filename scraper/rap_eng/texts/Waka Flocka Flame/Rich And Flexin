[Hook]
I'm drunk, I'm rich
I'm flexin, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Bitches all on my jock, they want my Dang-a-lang
Swinging all on my nuts like an orangutan
Half a million dollar car
Half a million dollar watch
No roof on the Drophead Phantom
It got karate chopped
Got a couple black belts
But they all from Louis Louis
Get get 'em wetter than scuba divers
These fuckin' groupy-groupies
Swagger's through the ceiling, these haters mad as fuck
Get money like Vegas chips
BITCH stack em up!

[Hook]
I'm drunk, I'm rich
I'm flexin, ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 2 - Waka Flocka]
Bitches be crying for me, they want my autograph
Shorty rollercoaster ridin: Six Flags
She'll food on that dick?
I'll never eat that bitch
Cold feelings, hard dick
No hands got me rich
Iâ€™m on my Bricksquad monopoly shit
Stuntin with the roof off
Flocka always flexin
Bad hoes always textin
Tatted up like a mexican
Magnums for protection
Flocka meet me at the weston

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
Up on my wish bone,These hoes get split in two
I dont want no birds up in my car, I dont drive no chicken coupe
I be all in that new ferrari, I be spillin out champaene
No rocks on the road Luda? Bitch they all in my damn chain
Gotta keep it moving Mami, Gotta get that guacamole
I got that purp and a little bit of gold, I got shit run with Kobe
Like I should shoot the jayyy and smoke a couple too
Other rappers wanna be my friends, Im to rich to Fuck with you
