[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, pow pow
Turn up, haha
Uh, squad

[Hook: Good Charlotte]
This is not a game now, nobody can save you
Spent up all your change and now your turn is done
We won't be afraid cause we're the ones who made you
Knock you out the frame, we won't stop until you're gone
Game on, game on

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Assassin, soldier and a captain
Feel the passion, no compassion, but I'm askin'
You say you play, well, I'm attackin'
A predator and my competitors been slackin'
I'm never lackin', boy, I'm ready for that action
That was braggin', man, what happened to you has-beens?
It's amazin' all the places and the people faces
Ah, board the tour bus like a spaceship
I'm racin' against nothin' but time
Probably wouldn't be so lost if you was watchin' the signs
They gon' play me like a PlayStation from playin' on their station
But, I'ma be the face of a generation
Kids wit' no patience or directions
Never doubt or question my effort
Game on, game on, hope you people ready
I'm reloaded and I hold my trigger finger steady

[Hook: Good Charlotte]
This is not a game now, nobody can save you
Spent up all your change and now your turn is done
We won't be afraid cause we're the ones who made you
Knock you out the frame, we won't stop until you're gone
Game on, game on

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Can't Xbox me in, cause in my lane
No controller, but me playin' my game
This a different league, a different bracket
I'm a different gene, a different faction
I will never fall off, I just fall back
Don't make me pull up, pull up where you boys ball at
And show you little fake hustlers what the trap is
I have you runnin' suicides all practice
I got warrior blood, I fear no heir
No army, no weapon, nomads
Killer instinct, I just go harder
Antarctica-heart, but I grow larger
I can't let you Mini-Mes steal my Austin Powers
I've traveled plenty seas, spent many hours
To make Flocka be the best he can be
So you gon' show respect when you talkin' to me
That number one spot legacy I see is my hit
And what you take what you is, what you leave behind

[Hook: Good Charlotte]
This is not a game now, nobody can save you
Spent up all your change and now your turn is done
We won't be afraid cause we're the ones who made you
Knock you out the frame, we won't stop until you're gone
Game on, game on
