[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I said my necklace iced out, my left wrist iced out
Waka Flocka Flame, stay out my lane because I'm thugged out
Niggas getting drugged out, you know what my clique 'bout
Hit him wit a bottle, stomp his motherfucking lights out
Hands on deck, make a nigga pull a tool out
Balling this year, I ain't gon' stop until I foul out
Wild out, wild out, Gudda Gudda wild out
Wild out, wild out, Waka Flocka wild out

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, Waka, Flocka, Waka, yeah
Get jumped in the club
Gudda, Waka Flocka, hey
Gudda, Waka Flocka, hey
Gudda, Waka Flocka, hey
Gudda, Waka Flocka, hey
For the cash, I'll wrap a nigga's ass up
Run up in his house Jim Carrey-style, masked up
We the new Wu-Tang, the new No Limit
The new N.W.A., what's up, Snoop and Dre?
Can't forget Eazy-E, ice cubes on my neck
Fozzie screaming, "Waka waka", bitch, I got that check
I don't need no flex, but I got to ball
Money Yao Ming, yes, it's that tall
But I'm gutta, gutta, what's up, Gudda Gudda?
I got rotten apple blood in my veins
I reversed the slave route, it's from up north to down south
No more mean mugs at my shows, throwing green love
Green flags, green love, su woo to the P's, blood

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money, nigga, I'ma rep to the death
You can see the YM tatted on my neck
All my niggas wild, choppers on deck
Stomp a nigga out, demand I respect
Me and Waka Flocka got the hand on the Tec
And it's cash on delivery, so hand me my check
Nigga, I don't talk much, but when I do, bitch, pay me
Big money heavyweight, you can ask Baby
Birdman schooled me, Wayne told me do me
And stack big paper up, no need for loose leaf
My rubberband stacks can't fold into knots
I decapitate the top with two hoes in the drop
I'm counting up the money till my hands get blisters
Told my bitch to come help me, we can count it up quicker, nigga
Real nigga music, they talking, we do's it
Free my nigga Weezy and free my nigga Gucci
Young Money

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Young Money, Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Bricksquad, Bricksquad, Bricksquad, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Young Money, Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Young Money, Bricksquad
Bricksquad, Bricksquad, Bricksquad, Bricksquad
