[Hook: T.O. Green]
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out
Y'all niggas playing, we'll turn that bitch to a shootout

[Verse 1: Lil Eazy]
Hold up, let Lil Eazy in this bitch
Cool out before a nigga get to squeezing in this bitch
I already got it hot, been putting the heater on the bitch
They already tried to plot and put the people on the [?]

[Verse 2: Deizel Nitti]
Juug Team, you know Deizel in this bitch

You better mob deep off in this bitch
'Cause I'll squad up, you better miss me with that shit, nigga

[Verse 3: T.O. Green]
749, Real Money, them my people
Four-fifth on me, [?] the loud for the reefer
If you're beefing with my squad, nigga, I wouldn't want to be you
(We don't fuck with T.O. Green)
And I don't fuck with y'all, neither
If the shit, it was a movie, you won't make it to the sequel
Give my J's a filthy smell and have you knocked out by some [?]
Hit them with the Tec and the Mac, so the hoes would [?] my equal
Heard you was talking shit, well nigga, it's on when I see you

[Hook: T.O. Green]
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out

[Verse 4: Slim Dunkin]
Hey, watch your mouth, nigga, before I pull the tool like Rambo
Show these fuck niggas what the southside stand for
Hold up and cool out before I gonna that tool out
Give a fuck, I'll turn the church parking lot to a shootout
They say I'm crazy 'cause I got one in the chamber on the safety
But I'd rather shoot myself than let a fuck nigga take me
You try to rob me? You must take me as a local joker
Put my hands up, fuck nigga, this ain't no roller coaster

[Verse 5: Lil Capp]
Hold up, calm down, take a chill pill, cool out, nigga
Y'all know what my crew 'bout, nigga
Better pack the shit and move out, nigga
Y'all don't want a shootout, nigga
Y'all don't want a shootout, nigga
Get ducked off in the house 'cause the block got too hot, nigga
Streets talking and the Feds watching
No one around when the lead popping
They said get him, I said got him
He disrespect, so I headshot him
Streets talking and the Feds watching
No one around when the lead popping
They said get him, I said got him
He disrespect, so I headshot him

[Hook: T.O. Green]

Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out
Hold up, cool out before I pull that tool out

[Verse 6: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shots fired, man down, Flocka love them gun sounds
Hold up, cool out before we pull them tools out
Take you to the parking lot so we can have a shootout
Hitsquad 'bout it 'bout it and Bricksquad shootout
Bloods over there, we got Bloods over here
This a redrum party, shawty, Bloods everywhere
Lime green chain, same color as my gang
H-S-T or call it the money gang

[Verse 7: Korbin15]
Chill out, sitting geeked in that bitch
You want beef in this bitch? I'm on your street with this shit
If a nigga claim he know me, if I'm sleeping with a bitch
Or probably on the road, packing heater with the clip
Said, [?] see me creep, yeah, we deep off in this bitch
We got choppers, we gonna pop them 'cause we street off in that bitch
And we rolling off them beans when I'm sleep off in this bitch
You can get shot at, get your ass beat off in this bitch
