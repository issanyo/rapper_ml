On Grove Street wait for it to touch down
On that pack right now it gotta touch down
Everybody impatient gotta touch down
Waiting on that work to drop it gotta touch down
Touch down (2x)
Waiting on that pack to drop it gotta touch down
Touch down (2x)
On Grove Street the drop that where it touch down

[Verse 1]
I'm trafficking the traffic (say what?)
Re-wrap the work up in plastic (wrapping in what?)
We make that shit flip like gymnastics
Try the crew shit gon get nasty
I'm with Waka Flocka we sitting here blowing on kush sticks
And I'm money hungry I'm getting bills like Bushwick
These niggas still hating, I'm like oh well
And these snitching niggas 12 like the hotel
I used to be the one that was trigger happy
Now I got my shooter
Right in my Twitter ?
He said he tried to send some niggas at me
But I ain't going for it I'm on Grove Street where they trigger happy
Coke
