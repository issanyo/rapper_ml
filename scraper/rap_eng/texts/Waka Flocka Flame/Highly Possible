[Chorus]
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you say to me drive me crazy
Baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
It's possible that we could be on tropical
Islands eatin' lobster, diamond's sicker than a hospital
You're crying cause it's possible that breaking up is probable
Fucking up your makeup and I'm acting like it's comical
You're still my baby, know them other bitches lazy, though
I'll never let you play me, ho, what you think, I'm crazy, ho?
Ain't nobody playing me unless it's on the radio
But I probably could still sell a show out when I'm 80, though
Uh, turn up God and I'm still at large
I just wanna party hard, ball at every cost
And I been chef-ing in the kitchen, oh, you smell the sauce
Stacking records like a weapon, 'bout to let it off
Too focused to be fucking with them whack hoes
Strapped bros, tryna keep up ta dis cash flow
We ain't seeing eye to eye, but still my ride or die
And if I went to jail today, you'll take the stand and lie

[Chorus]
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm just out here tryna keep this shit functioning
See them bitches on her Gram, tryna suck it in
And they just wanna suck me off so they could tell a friend
Vodka, grams, and some Xans, then she wreck the Benz
I got a free spirit, at times it's a flaw
They say that's why say I'm a star, dust the diamond off
I light it all while we shoot for the moon
When you a dog, above the law, it's kinda hard to be groomed
I'm a real nigga, baby, through it and through
By me keeping it a buck, I'm showing the proof
They say the world want da truth, but they love lies
Smoking weed on the beach while the sun rise
Close my eyes while I think about fun times
6 am, I call you, it ring one time, uh
We ain't seeing eye to eye, but still my ride or die
And if I went to jail today, you'll take the stand and lie

[Chorus]
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
That these things that you do to me drive me crazy
It's highly possible, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby girl
