[Beat]

[Verse 1]
Took a dab, took a dab
Now I'm feeling rab
Hip hop, mob beneath the top
[?]
You let me live first
I was dead last
I told you O, Let's Do It and then we sped past

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2]
Show me where the king, point him out
One day we're gon' meet and I'ma see what you about
I keep a few pistols tucked in my accounts
Plenty henny and a blunt in my mouth
Get the fuck out of my house
Rappers say sophisticated shit to sound clever
When it come to business, I handle mine better
But I handle my sweater, I'm revealing my pistol
I'ma hit him with a missile
Grim reaper gon' kiss him
Ain't nobody gon' miss him, just another dead rapper
Man [?] drinking lean, he a fake trapper
Rich dope fiends, how the fuck you get famous
We from the jungle, can't blame us or tame us
I'm cold to the sinless, your heinous
I'm the nicest definest, and the rhymes all timeless

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3]
A lot of rapper wafted me
And gradually, I had to be
Better than every rapper, these critics be naming after me
I'm a savage doing damage, if hes after me
Fuck yo salary, you get catastrophe, I'll blast you to reality
You can't fuck with me, or push your luck with me
I kicked you out of the public, you just a sitting duck to me
Now suddenly, I let that heat out like a oven b money tree
So I got a green thumb, I kinda love my theme song

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3]
Rapping's full of metaphors, but they don't really love themselves
Pass the mic, your hermaphrodite, and go and fuck yourselves
I feel like Biggie in a tunnel, without 100 Brooklyn niggas
I stay away from crooked niggas, sideways looking niggas
Taylor's gettin' prayed, but what they say on social media
You don't really know me, your just reading Wikipedia
Pull up at yo front door, take the [?]
Slap the holy ghost, I let anyone agree with ya
I feel like Nas 01, this my Ether
You rappers couldn't make it with a Jay-Z feature
We way deeper, you pay people to slay people
Instead of change, we blade evil to hate people
My people, black, white and brown people
Fuck skin tone, cuz we all equal
I'm just tryna teach you
And if my hands can't do it, let me voice reach you
They say the people need you

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 4]
Look at Waka putting them all good words together
Them old fans checking back, like they heard me better
He was playing with this rap shit the whole time
I was geeked up, freestyling in my old rhymes
Back in 09, now I'm taking my time
Elevating my mind, I got the game in my palms
Say As-salamu alaykum, Wa alaykumu salam
Arm, leg, leg on head, lets break bread
All I need is proper sentence, spent the winter in Queens
Realize that I'm living my dream
Keep going, that's a river-dale thing
One thing I won't do is let my feet fail me
Keep prevailing
Shit, keep selling
Let's go!

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 5]
You got no fucking clue what I've been through
Learn to never get in shark water that I swim through
They say guns kill people, that defends you
Kinda fucked up, the type of shit that your friends do
Its fucking with my mental, it used to be simple
When I'm done with you, they I.D. you by ya dentals
And that's the end y'all, muthafuckin be all
I holla out that b card, my boss will come see ya
I could never be ya, yall bout knee tall
Better hope I never meet ya, I have to teach ya
And when I'm dead, bury me 5 feet
My team elite, treat every man equally
Cuz we all kings with billion dollar dreams
WAKA FLOCKA

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 6]
Here comes the brand new Flocka in yo ears
Put the gun down, no choppa in the air
You gotta think deeper, and believe is one
People gotta work for ya money, ain't nobody gon' feed ya
A new page need a turn, need to save what we earn
You could save every day, or live a little while you learn
No divisions, support family business if
We all came together, shit is all limitless

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 7]
I ain't gotta fucking flex, been around these streets
Been a man my G, now its time to mainstream
I just made a 100 bands, for a show in UStream
Prince of the fucking south, my fourth album call me king
I'm married to the streets, you niggas just had a fling
I live the shit that I speak, you niggas just sipping lean
Popping pills, looking sick in talking fiction
I'm different, I'm on my mission, got visits off getting richer
Rapping 4 years, could have been in college
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets, the energy acknowledged
I pull up looking polished
My whip ain't got no mileage
My work turn bitches gay
Man I'm like this shit okay
God took me out the hood, threw me on stage
My heart was full of pain, anger and full off rage
Getting high hills, blowin that stiletto
I keep to myself, watch you puppets get Geppetto'd
I'm my own Captain keep it Brackin' for the ghetto
We see who y'all trust, when the fucking dust settle
Revolutionary rebel, [?]
5 rings like thee Olympic necks full of gold medals
Woah!
