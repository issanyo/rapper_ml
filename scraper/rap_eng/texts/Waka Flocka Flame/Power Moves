[Intro]
Power move
I consider a power move
Being on the high 9 5
Strapped up with some fives
Shorty holding the weight, how much can she take?

[Hook]
Power moves, boy
Power moves, boy
On that i-95 that’s how power moves, boy
Power moves, boy
What’s a power move?
Shorty got that china in her vagina
That’s how power moves boy
??Go tight just with thong??
I'm gon' bring that back round
Power moves, boy
Power moves you ain’t never seen that in your life
I’m yelling yeah!

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
1 plus 1 is 2, 2 plus 2 is 4
I don’t need no calculator
Just bring me the world
My wrist wrapped
You get me one pack, and got shit back
I got a band dummy, with ice on it, no six pack
Me don’t lie, he don’t fight
I got that glow white, knock 'em out like Kimbo Slice
Playing with me is like playing with the Lord
Don’t buy what you can’t afford
Talking about "you in a drop-top Benz"
But what I seen is a Honda accord
Said I’m ready, flat drama nigga
No black belt but I chop chop, no karate nigga
Work, work, put em in the hearse
Nigga better kill me first, boy
I ain’t telling no cops, just another nigga that’s shot
Put 'em in the dirt

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I’m climbing up, charge no mountain get
Critics hate my start'em, they fear I ain’t going nowhere
Get that through your head, fuck you "chase bread"
Play dead when I pull up, where we from right now
Shorty throw your hood up
Get rich, you gonna get fed train
??? Got 20 birds ???
Can’t play with yours, won’t play with mines
??? I bet that ??? fed cure, that's what money do
That’s a power move
Won’t serve you if I don’t know you
I ain’t never had a loan I can’t handle
On I-95 taking chances
These squeeze niggas round me dangerous
Try'na rob, must be out of your anus
That ampheta make you famous
Twisting up fangers, hanging with the bangers
Waka flame!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Frenchie]
BSM, MDE, F1 - my family
D&D said hip hop’s dyin', stop cryin', it’s up to me
Gimme a beat and I rip it apart
Strip it apart, just like the bike that been stolen from you
You can’t ride it no more cause it’s stripped from its parts
I feel like it’s too hard living, but I’m afraid to die
My whole life living, I’ve been told lies
Lord who lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Pray for me, I’m on I-9 5
Fender stuffed with keys
I get caught remember me, my mama won’t bury me
And I’m so for real me and the boys, slanging heavy d
RIP to Heavy D, I had to divorce the weed
Cause that white for me and best believe that bitch gonna marry me

[Hook]
