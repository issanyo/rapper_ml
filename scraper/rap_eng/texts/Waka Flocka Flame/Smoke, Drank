[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
A long ride to the west
M.O.B. across my chest
Lord, please don't let me rest
Why these niggas wanna test?
Nigga, please give me strength
One time, I don't got friends
Ride this shit to the end
Can't lose, man, I got to win
Juvenile, so I keep 2 Glocks
Flockaveli, I'm that Damu, oc
Light-skinned, tats, gold dreadlocks
Niggas playing cops like Matlock
Aim on point with his scope and his beam
Spray it at your head like oil sheen
Leave a nigga dead, eyes rolled back
Bow! Bow! Bow! Nigga, hold that
Bitch, I’m from the Grove
Where niggas have a hand, they get on the stove
Some pop pills, some take it up the nose
Where niggas fucking hoes at thirteen
Living street life, fuck a hoop dream
Brick Squad. that’s my home team

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga

[Verse 2: Mouse]
Middle finger to the Feds
M.O.B. tatted on my leg
A couple niggas wanna see me dead
Act like D-Bo, get Craig'ed
Pussy niggas heard what the fuck I said
Room service, too, I'll make your bed
Bury your body in a backyard shed
Make a nigga whole body shake, no dreads
Niggas don't really want to roll with the kid
I got more connects than a highway bridge
Flow been cold, stored in a fridge
A lot of niggas talking about what they should have did
Called them niggas squares like a motherfucking grid
I'm on my grown man like a nigga had a kid
Got to ball on you niggas like I'm playing for the Knicks
Hit them with a shotgun, I call that shit the Clips
I ain't worried about the cops, I'm too legit
I got to put money over every single bitch
Mouse in the hood, trapping for that cheese
Balling 'cause I hustle like I'm playing overseas
I was raised in the streets, me and my pistol
Moving these pounds on my bicycle
I'm so official, I earned my stripes
Bitches on my dick like a parasite
I make her tap out like the cane's spiked
Then I smoke and drink all fucking night

[Chorus: Mouse]
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga
Smoke, drink, smoke, drink, nigga

[Interlude: Mouse & Kebo Gotti]
Waka, what it do, cuz?
I'm fucking with you, nigga, the long way
Let's get this money
Brick Squad in the building
Squad up, squad up, squad up

[Verse 3: Kebo Gotti]
See, I’ma smoke 'til I can't smoke no more, then drink 'til I can't drink no more
Plant a money seed and my chick grow
Stand up tall 'til it can’t no more
Try me if you want, I swear to God, I'll split your cantaloupe
My chopper fully loaded, I'ma squeeze on you 'til there ain't no more
I run real C like OG and them
Run with the B like Flocka and them
Green flag, that's my partner, them
Hit Squad, man, there's a lot of them
You get an Oscar, slim, for acting gangsta
A boss to him, better get your rank up
Real Money, been had our bank up
In the club, buying bottles just to pour the drink up
Who is this nigga trying to act like me?
Swear he getting money, bounce back like me
And every hood, every block count stacks like me
Fully loaded Glock, stay strapped like me
Nigga, you a nobody of Kebo Gotti
Mr. I Got It, all about a nigga's profit
Flocka with a tool, would've been done got him
Been done hit him, been done shot him
Been done offed him, then laugh about it
While I'm blowing on kush straight from Cali
Irene shit, straight out the valley
I'ma duct tape shit and I ain't talking alley
Flying in the bird and I ain't talking falcon
Plead the fifth every time they ask me
Disappear just like it's magic
Then reappear, lights, camera, action

[Chorus: Kebo Gotti]
I smoke, drink, smoke, drink
I smoke, drink, smoke, drink
I smoke, drink, smoke, drink
I smoke, drink, smoke, drink

[Outro: Kebo Gotti]
Flocka, Gotti
Cuz, I see you, nigga
All the way on the west coast, nigga
Back on the east coast, nigga
Y'all know how we do it, man
Hit Squad, Brick Squad, nigga
I'm [?] out
Gone
