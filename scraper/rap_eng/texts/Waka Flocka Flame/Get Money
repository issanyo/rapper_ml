[Intro:]
Big homie Flock
BSM

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka]
Automatics and dice games
We was gettin' money till the Feds came
Big Daddy Kane on my clothes and you could still smell raw cocaine
Would my family have survived without cocaine?
We thank God when that blow came
Walkin' through the rain without a coat
Livin' with a (?) prove, hope that we all make it out to get (?)
Leonardo how I paint these pictures
My niggas so relentless, vicious
Eat your food, do your dishes
Now all your family's left with is memories and pictures
Fuck niggas, fuck bitches
Fuck niggas, fuck bitches
Get money, stack money
I wish they act wrong, even act funny
I got bitches that'll die, killers that'll clap for me

[Hook: Kobe]
I know you're mad when I get grindin'
I know you hate it, it's all good
We out here gettin' all this paper
I know you mad, you wish you could
Get money, get money, get money

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
Please don't get it confused, this is rap money
Mixed with a little street money
I'm talkin' 'bout them long drives, don't sleep money
Bitches walking on the blade, that dirty deep money
I was told don't talk, just look
Family on the streets, I was raised by the crooks
Certified street, never raised by the book
Street educated, I can tell that you shook, rapper
Every good girl love a hood nigga
Real recognize real, you ain't a real nigga
I'm takin' over companies, signing deals
If you wanna build, make a mil, never skip a meal
Keep your lips sealed nigga
Fuck niggas, Tommy Hillfigure
You take care your family, keep it real I fuck with ya
Boy, there's levels to this shit
I set fire to that ass like the Devil in this bitch
Squad!
