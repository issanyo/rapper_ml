[Intro: Big Bank]
You know every day
I try to make the next day better than the last day
Do something positive
Focus on the profit
Today is the day

Zaytoven

[Chorus: Big Bank]
Today is the day
Today is the day
Today is the day (today)
I can see the sun (sun)
Had a hell a lot of cloudy ones (cloudy ones)
Today is the day i've been waitin' on (today)
Today today today is the day (yeah)
Today gon' be a good one (a good one)
Can't let nobody steal my joy (Can't let nobody steal my joy)
Not today, no way

[Verse 1: Big Bank]
Today is the day (today)
It's time to get paid (get paid)
I feel some type of way (feel good yall)
I woke up in a good mood
Put on all my jewelry (all of it)
Make a hater furious (bitch)
Today i'm feelin' better than i've felt in a long time
Feel like old times again
My bitch ain't bitchin' (ain't bitchin)
All in my business
She let a nigga live today (she let me live)
Plus I did numbers in the trap
Called all my caps made a big [?] today

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka!
I woke up on a good side emoji happy face (you know)
I'ma be drunk before noon shitfaced (Waka!)
Smoke it by the bell
Drink d'uss√© by the case
I told black to pull 'em cars out these women wanna play
We on south beach [?]
Thirty bottles of rose
Please treat me with respect because that burner on my waist (you know)
Sucker for a cute face
Sucker for a cute face
Slim waist, babe gave me the keys to her place (squad!)
She won't fuck with you fakes
My day goin' good, won't let them steal my joy (nah)
Put that on my hood
Love my lil' girl, her smile mean a world
(Waka Flocka Flames!)

[Chorus: Big Bank]
Today is the day

Had a hell a lot of cloudy ones (cloudy ones)
Today is the day i've been waitin' on (today)
Today today today is the day (yeah)
Today gon' be a good one (a good one)
Can't let nobody steal my joy (Can't let nobody steal my joy)
Not today, no way
