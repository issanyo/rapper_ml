[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stunt, ball seven days of the week
Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
Get street money like I'm Big Meech
I stunt, ball seven days of the week
Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
Get street money like I'm Big Meech

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Sellin' pies like Papa John's
Rockin' ice like Papa Joes
Don't fuck with shawty, that Flocka ho
Traphouse jumpin like Flocka show
Sellin' weed, bitch we sellin' snow
Got the mollies, we got the blow
Sellin' D, you got to know
I could buy some more dope, bitch I need a boat
I'm Waka Flocka Flame nigga, clique full of chain gang niggas
All I know is gangbang nigga, all I know is gangbang nigga
Before rap I had street fame, a real nigga gon' remain
You can play ball, then you cook game
From Riverdale, better tuck your chain
I ball, I stunt seven days of the week
Talk shit 'bout me, can't wait til we meet
Blow O's of the Cali seven days of the week
Red bottoms on her feet if she fuckin' with me
Know some niggas that squeeze when the cops came, freeze
Keep a nigga baby mama all on her knees
Waka Flocka Flame, bitch I run these streets
I'm a real ass nigga screamin' BFM

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stunt, ball seven days of the week
Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
Get street money like I'm Big Meech
I stunt, ball seven days of the week
Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
Get street money like I'm Big Meech

[Verse 2: Derez De'Shon]
Gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me from the west to east
DGBSM, only real niggas stand next to me
Black strap, call it Wesley
These hatin' niggas ain't stressin' me
Seven days a week I fuck seven fees
Call Peso, I need a extra P
'Cause I'm extra fire, extra high, molly all in my body
And I'm kickin shit like Jackie Chan, them Louis V karate
I got a red bitch and that pussy fire, guess she a hot tamale
And she smart at fuckin', that head good like she graduated from college
Seven days a week I'm getting paid nigga
Seven days a week I get laid nigga
Seven days a week I'm countin' chips
In LA nigga, I'm straight nigga
Going hard every day, tryna slay the streets
Nigga I'm in the trap seven days a week

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I stunt, ball seven days of the week
Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
Get street money like I'm Big Meech

Smoke kush seven days of the week
Fuck hoes seven days of the week
Rock designer clothes seven days of the week
Drive foreign seven days of the week
Respected from the west to the east
Live a real nigga 'til I D-I-E
