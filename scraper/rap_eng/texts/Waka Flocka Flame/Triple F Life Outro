My partner got murk'd, friends turnin' phony
Next door neighbors tryna put the people on me
Lifes a bitch, I see a brother death creepin on me
Pain I write it on me, whatch these labels tryna clone me
Pain I write it on me, P-pain I write it on me
Pain I write it on me, whatch these labels tryna clone me?
Pain I write it on me, P-pain I write it on me
Pain I write it on me, whatch these labels tryna clone me?

Couple of Friends, Couple of Fans and my Family
Imma ride it to the end ain't no fear in me (-x'2)
My partner got murked friends turning phony
Next door neighbors tryna put the people on me
Lifes a bitch, I see a brother death creepin on me
Pain I write it on me, Watch these labels tryna clone me?
Count my days in blessings, though every mistake made was a life learned lesson
Swear I ain't flexin
Police pulls us over cuz the color of our complexion
And our hair style now we standing on trail
Me against the world so Im voicin my opinion
Did I forget to mention how they stole my mom the credit? (Debby]
And Our blueprint, gave it to another nigga
Left us all stuck, yea we fucked up
Damn
Ive been going through so much, Ive been thinking bout so much
I dont know who to trust or who to believe uh
Couple of friends, Couple of fans and my family
Imma ride it to the end ain't no fear in me (-x'2)
December 16, a part of me died
Part of me stayed strong but a part of me cried
Part of me on this song why Im spillin my pain
Part of me getweak when they mention your name
It go RIP Slim D (who?) Hatin' niggas took your life over envy
A lot of snakes in the grass, Lord protect me
When I make it to the gates dont reject me
Ive been going through it, dont know, when its my turn
So I just sip a little and the blunt burn
Everything I do, I do it for my family
And my heart too big, God fan me, Fan me
Ive been going through so much, Ive been thinking bout so much
I dont know who to trust or who to believe uh
Couple of friends, Couple of fans and my family
Imma ride it to the end ain't no fear in me (-x'2)
My partner got murk'd, friends turnin' phony
Next door neighbors tryna put the people on me
I wish I could fly away
I wish I could fly away
I wish I could fly away
