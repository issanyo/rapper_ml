[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
We in them brand new whips, offsets, no scrubbing
Always blowing loud that's a gram for a dubbie
Everyday worth to live the life like a movie
Shit be so loud, why you think this girl is choosing?
We in them brand new whips, offsets, no scrubbing
Always blowing loud that's a gram for a dubbie
Everyday worth to live the life like a movie
Shit be so loud, why you think this girl is choosing?

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hold on, Waka; watch out, Flocka; all these girls is one Flame
Know my clique and who my gang and what the fuck I claim
Offset rims and candy paint
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I fresh?
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I fly?
Waka Flocka Flame the best
'Cause our refs, we gonna ball out, drink till we fall out
And [?] till we can't walk, I'm rolling and I can't talk
Kush got me dizzy, I'm living in the Matrix
A nigga disrespect me, I'ma leave his ass faceless
Wrist? 20 bands
Neck? 30 bands
Balling like a Benjamin
This the shit I'm rapping
Wrist? 20 bands
Neck? 30 bands
Balling like a Benjamin
Now, this the shit I'm rapping

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
We in them brand new whips, offsets, no scrubbing
Always blowing loud that's a gram for a dubbie
Everyday worth to live the life like a movie
Shit be so loud, why you think this girl is choosing?
We in them brand new whips, offsets, no scrubbing
Always blowing loud that's a gram for a dubbie
Everyday worth to live the life like a movie
Shit be so loud, why you think this girl is choosing?

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Woke up in the morning, then went and bought another car
Jewelry game stupid, Gucci Mane the superstar
Wise guy an idiot, sick chain literally
Your girl into me, Gucci on that silly shit
Nightclub diamonds? Light bulb diamonds
It's a crying shame how my right arm's shining
Left arm blinding, earrings blinding
Me and your girl, four days, three islands
Take my shirt off, goddamn, it's getting hot in here
Waka Flocka, Gucci Mane, Wooh, Frenchie out of here
Offset like a jet, Waka, where the landing gear?
Gucci Mane La Flare and my wrist look like a chandelier

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
We in them brand new whips, offsets, no scrubbing
Always blowing loud that's a gram for a dubbie
Everyday worth to live the life like a movie
Shit be so loud, why you think this girl is choosing?

[Verse 3: Frenchie]
My life is like a movie, Why get in that dually?
Gucci in that M6, Wooh's chain fooling
Southside Jamaica, Riderdale, Zone 6
When you step into these areas, make sure you own bricks
Candy painter six, I think I'm the shit
VVS' for my hand, so I raise my wrist
1017, I just broke, like, seven G
Balling in the mall like money grow on trees
Dro come from the Tropics, money is the topic
And plus, I got the plug like a socket, you get it?
You know I'm the shit-it, flow game is terrific
And my clique, I'ma stay committed
Yes
