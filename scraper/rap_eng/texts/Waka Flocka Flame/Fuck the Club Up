[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Im just thugging in the club with my squad, bitch, we deep
If a nigga jump stupid, then it's two things: hands and feet
If I holler, "Squad up", like football, bitch, we blitzing
All hell finna break loose, this the anthem

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Bitch I'm drunk, bitch I'm drunk
Bitch I'm crunk, bitch I'm crunk
Shawty, I'm tired of this lame nigga talking shit
I'm finna swing, I'm finna swing, I'm finna swing
My whole clique rowdy, man down, Brick Squad off the chain
I bet I'll knock his ass out with this one punch
His homeboy looking like he want it, so my dog dropped him
Security say calm down, shawty, they don't really want it
My whole clique jumping up and down like y'all don't want it
Pilld and weed, so I'm out my mind
Niggas saying they looking for me, you know Flock not hard to find
WWE in this bitch, shawty, ee can Royal Rumble
Tarzan shawty, Clayton County, that's the jungle
Shawty let's rumble, fuck this club up

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some

[Verse 2: Pastor Troy]
I got 'bout 50 niggas VIP
Tatted up, D.S.G.B
PT Cruiser, Waka Flock
Hit them niggas with the Glock
Off in the club, I can barely move
$1500 for the shoes
Dropped $3,000 on the coke
Hell nah, hoe, you can’t smoke
South side, nigga, what you know about that?
Nearby the club straight to the gat
If you wanna throw them hands, then let’s go
Whoop them on the dance floor
If his partners wanna buck
Tell them I don’t give a fuck
Slap them, smack them, pop them, drop them
Chop them, stop them, Waka Flocka
Pass the disaster, Vietnam
Nigga, I don’t give a fuck where you from
Hope you got your shit together
Pussy niggas know better
I just wanna fire off
In this bitch with Nina Ross
If you put your hands up
We gon' fuck this club up

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
When we hit the scene, better jump the line
Or we gon' turn the parking lot into Columbine
One phone call, I be right there
Slim Dunk AKA promoter’s nightmare
Dunk don’t play
Ever seen a Blood getting cracked with a K?
Nigga owe me money, then the nigga gon' pay
Fuck about a kid bringing drama where you stay
Shit where you sleep, gon' flush where you lay
365, you can die any day
Bad boy, too, nigga, no Slim Shady
I’s gonna come, nigga, watch what you say
White boy drunk, think about throwing
Show him, show her, show him, show her
Jumped on the stage, tear the whole floor up
Slim time bomb, nigga, know I'm finna blow up
Pussy nigga that might dance
Got no hands, ain’t got no chance
Talking 'bout money, Flocka got them bands
Everything Tru, nigga, look at my pants, Dunk

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the, fuck the club up
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some
Who, who, who, who
Want some, want some, want some, want some

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, Waka, bow!
