[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Lenses on my face, I see you aviator haters
Homies with the elevators, car Indiana Pacers
Never rockin' alligators, just some red bottom Chucks
Gone off a gram of mollies, I don't give a fuck
Fo-fo-forty tucked, when shit pop, you came with 'em, you better duck
All I know is stay strapped, get money, and run it up
Got my foreign choppas on my nigga Soulja
Talkin' bout Flocka then you know it’s game over
BOW!

[Hook: Wooh Da Kid] (x2)
All I know get it, get it, got it, now it’s gone
Keep a lot of straps ‘cause I know the war’s on
Never cross the line, you know I’m my brother’s keeper
Hurry, get 'em quick, this a message to the reaper

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
I’m from Jamaica, Queens, I’m looking for a queen
I guess it’s only right, since Wooh da the king
Yea Wooh da the man, better fit me in your plans
Niggas sleeping on me, guess they fucked up on the Xans
It’s time to wake em up, pour white coffee in a cup
Every ball fly paper, it’ll leave you stuck
Wooh da I’m the K-I-N-G
BSM the army, be all that you can be
Squad!

[Hook: Wooh Da Kid]

[Interlude: Waka Flocka Flame]
10 bands on line 1
20 racks on line 2
45 racks on line 3
75000 for a show, now that’s monopoly

[Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid]
Waka Flocka that’s my brother, fuck with him I put you under
Wooh da packin' heat, but keep it neat like a thunder
All I know is get it get it, got it now it’s gone
That’s my blood brother, it’s gon' be until we gone

[Hook: Wooh Da Kid]

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW
Head shot, head shot, red dot
Hey boy, you came wit' 'em, you better duck wit' 'em
You better fight wit' 'em when I bust, nigga
Do the ducking game man, money dance man, bands on deck
BSM man, we get money man, 1-0-1-7
SQUAD
