Brick Squad

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down

[Interlude: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, Waka, Flocka, Waka
Flocka, Waka, Flocka, Waka, yeah

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I robbed so many niggas, karma came right back around
I jumped so many niggas, karma came right back around
I can see myself laying on that ground, blood leaking everywhere
Yeah, I want to scream, but I ain't have no fear
Better wear head gear 'cause this year, I'm going hard
Put that shit on Hit Squad, I'm pulling all y'all pussy cards
Shout out to that fuck nigga, tried to rob me at the Wal-Mart
Ran up on his car, had him eating shells like Mario Go Kart
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Broke bank then, now I'm nigga rich
Ass, they be kissing it
My money, I'm not lending it 'cause y'all ain't never give me shit

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
All I know is killers, sick thoughts in my head right now
I wanna kill a nigga for trying to run for fucking pounds
Cock my shit, I'ma bust my pound
That's my dog, I'ma die with him
Cock my shit, then ride with him
That's just how the west side did him
Slick ass niggas, they love to cross
YG Hootie loves the boss
Try to play me, I'ma wipe you out
Real killer shit what my life about
Shout out to the niggas that I've done got
Me and my team, we've got this locked
We thugging and shining
Find me in west side Bompton

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down

[Verse 3: P Smurf]
My paint still wetter than the bullet, won't change
Glowing like a full moon, stretch range full of goons
28's same color as the rocks on the piece
Louis seats, Louis sneaks, so yeah, I can do that
P Smurf, red diamonds in the cross
My speakers sound like a Mak-90 getting off
It's a jungle out here, but I'm a warrior
My baby mama say I love the streets more than her
You niggas like the Tin Man, you ain't got no heart
I get down with ten men, nigga, I got heart
Pull up to the gas station on 111th
Bell'n tell a nigga, "Let me get a hundred on eleven"
Nigga, I ain't stopped rapping, I just stopped rapping to beats
Start rapping in prostitutes' ear
Now, look at me

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down
I told my Lord to get my back for all the crazy shit I did
Yeah, karma coming back around
You know I'm not backing down
AK love that "ka-ka" sound
So much shit, might back out now
One-on-one, can't last one round
Many men wanna see me down

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka, Waka, Flocka, Waka
Flocka, Waka, Flocka, Waka
