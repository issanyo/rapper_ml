[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
It be crazy right
Cause the person you most sleep on
I be the one that make it
I struggle hard I grind hard man I go hard man
Turn my vocals up

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Now this the realest shit I ever wrote
My best friend I grew up with strung out on coke
Now this the realest shit I ever wrote
Why everybody I grew up with down the road
Now this the realest shit I ever wrote
All my hits I made until today I never wrote
Now this the realest shit I ever wrote
I've been through so much shit I could stand in the rain and not soak
Pray that I don't go broke

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
No I've been through so much shit lord please don't let me go broke no
I'm from Clayton County were them young niggas don't die ho
Turn up
They don't ride no country nigga
They don't ride no from Clay county nigga
I came from nothing but the song
And now all these niggas wanting some
When I was young I got the dollar menu
And some noodles nigga yo
When it comes to shoes every six months
Me and my brothers got a new pair
I'm blessed to be standing here

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Come on help them come on come on check
Hundred thousand in my mailbox
Bless my niggas locked up in a box
I could never be a snitch middle finger cops
This the realest shit I ever wrote
Lord why my childhood best friend strung out on coke
I'm just looking for some answers
I'm just looking for some answers
They killed my daddy killed my brother
Plus my Auntie Cuff
Get the HIV then took my best friend away from me
So I'm popping pills, drinking liquor, smoking weed
Cause I'm stressed out mentally

[Hook]
