[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Cartel MGM]
What do you do when police kick your door
Tell everybody get down on the floor? (I'ma shoot)
Better have bond and a good-ass lawyer
'Cause when you step in front of the judge, he ain’t gon’ show your ass no love
What do you do if a truck backing up
With bales and bricks and it’s all filled up?
I’ma turn my stove on, I’ma turn my scale on
Trapping with my Ruger so I’m never home alone

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Dope in my nuts, hand on my Glock
12 pull up, then we dumping on the fucking cops
I’ll be damned if I run, I gotta get my money
Trying to get the trap jumping like Bugs Bunny
Ain’t shit funny, fucking with MGM
So much fucking pounds, so much fucking bricks
Got new goons, them boys Mexican
Hella tattoos, them boys bad news
Bad attitude with a good aim, nigga
I’m still the same nigga from the same block, nigga
Stupid hustle game, what a wicked jump shot
Stupid hustle game, what a wicked jump shot

With bales and bricks and it’s all filled up?
I’ma turn my stove on, I’ma turn my scale on
Trapping with my Ruger so I’m never home alone

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
What do you do if them pussies breaking in?
Choice A: run; choice B: start shooting
Choice C: murk them and throw them in the river
Don’t try me 'cause I’m a choice C nigga
What would you do with a brick in the pot?
Cartel would whip it up and set up shop
South Atlanta, Zone 3, that’s my home base
Trigger finger funny, it only aims for the face
What would you do if Cartel tied your bitch up
And said, "I need 200 thousand for her ransom"?
Smoking kush with Flocka and my nigga Kinto
Finger on the trigger like a South Atlanta ‘migo

[Verse 3: Kinto]
You know a ‘migo model, I’m deep every time
You know a ‘migo model stay strapped with a Glock 9
You know a ‘migo model sell your ass a brick or pound
Kinto, MGM boys, it’s going down
Pussy nigga, try me, get your life declined
Hit them with the chopper 'bout 36 times
Black tee, black Levi’s, and a black mask
I’ll do it bare face if I really need the cash
85 hundred Mafia
Tell them cops, tell them Feds ain’t no stopping us
What will I do if they run through my door?
Flush the work, try to make it out the back door
