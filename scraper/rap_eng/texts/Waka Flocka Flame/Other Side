Fuck the other side
My dogs down to ride
Lay you on the floor
Mafioso
Mafia
Monopoly

Chorus (Cartel MGM):
Fuck the other side
My dogs down to ride
I got killers that terminate on sight
Y'all some hoes (2x)
Run up on you and make you hit the floor
Fuck the other side, my dogs down to ride (2x)
Y'all some hoes (2x)
Fuck the other side, my dogs down to ride

Cartel MGM:
Don't run up on me talking stupid crazy
My homies say they ready my tools never on safety
If he want beef I'ma eat him it's tasty
My enemies can die slow I've been feeling like this lately
20 Niggas against me I still put my hands up
Like y'all better kill me 'cause I'ma shoot this shit up
Gotcha, just give it up
Me and my team don't give a fuck
Do a drive-by in a Chevrolet Pick-up
Y'all some hoes acting all sensitive
He crying: Please give me a chance to live
You can tell my haters they can go eat a dick
I'ma light that pussy up like a cigarette

(Chorus Cartel MGM)

Waka Flocka Flame:
Shawty hold up
This Monopoly we don't run from beef
We don't compromise
Fuck that other side
Everybody strapped and ready hope you down to ride
Catch a homocide better tuck in your pride
They say what don't kill me can only make me stronger
Just realize you ain't real 5 and see the hatred in your eyes
Lord tell me why it gotta be this way
Let me bow my head and pray before I throw my life away with a grey SK
Finger fuck my beef won't stop 'til my enemies rest in peace and the gun powder pitbull off the leash
Last nigga tell me shit now he under me
You can read about his eulogy
When it come to beef I get so much fucking energy
Close casket dumb bastard if you try to injure me

(Chorus Cartel MGM)
