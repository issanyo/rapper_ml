[Verse 1]
Two shots to his melon, Waka Flocka
Presidential flooded bezels for my partners
For that dope and that Pyrex, the youngins in the projects
Are turning into pirates, empty out your pockets
Murk you in your 'partments, roll your body up in some carpet
Should've kept your mouth closed, should've never started
Soon as I'm done I'm flipping in another cartridge
I'm a real shooter, just call me James Harden
Don't mind me, my dog I'm just flossing
Better keep your distance, proceed with caution
Fuck boy, fuck boy, y'all just some fuck boys
Ain't gonna have it on me, got Chaz in the cut boy
Walk anywhere and my chain never tucked boy, talk, boy NEVER
Make a nigga heart beat a capella
Stomp a nigga out in Italian leather
You a street nigga then we birds of a feather
Make a girl fuck a girl just for the pleasure
I'm talking boss shit, real mob nigga
Turn your wife and money, where your life guard, nigga?
El Chapo shit, find your body parts, nigga
You ain't a drug dealer, you a rapping ass nigga
Just get cash, rob your ass with no masks's
Spend a day in my hood, probably won't last nigga

[Hook]
Squad!
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Squad up, squad up, squad up (3x)
Word to the wise, don't fuck with mine (2x)

[Verse 2]
20K nigga, every club that I walk through
Face card good, every city that I walk through
One phone call have my young niggas off you
Clap him 33 times, round of applause you
RIP shirts, momma said that she lost you
Ain't gotta get my hands dirty, that's what a boss do
Told you fuck niggas it's l gon' cost you
I told you fuck niggas it's gon' cost you
Wanna get a nigga hit, I'm the one you need to talk to
Real street shit what I brought you
Welcome to mi casa, my floor made of marble
200K, good in the A
Good in the Bay, I'm a Drama King, Kay Slay '
Real nigga coming through, make way
Send them goons where you stay, in the bushes where they lay
Niggas know I don't play, man down, white flag, mayday
If you feeling some kind of way,  I'm sending Kenny B at em'
Send the B's send the C's, send the G's, Lords at em
I don't do no talking,  I just make shit happen
Drop my name in the verse, bet my shooters start clapping like BLOUW!
You ain't eating with the squad, then it's fuck you nigga like BLOUW!
I'ma say it with pride, I'ma yell it out loud

[Hook]
Squad!
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Fuck nigga, I'm yelling out squad
UP!
Squad up, squad up, squad up (3x)
Word to the wise, don't fuck with mine (2x)
