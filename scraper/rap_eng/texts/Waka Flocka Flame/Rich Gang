[Verse 1]
Homie said she real, baby tryna phone or pop this pill
Niggas on your hunned dollar, write my will
Splurge game in this bitch, it's Johnny Gill
Hundred pounds of kris, go sip baby still
Every other month off me – half a mill
So I don't do drugs, if the k ever show
Start this blow, that's all I know
I'm a go hard, what these fuck boys say?
Cover it up, he a fool with the K
Lay a nigga trap, that's where he gon lay
Snap this chick, that fritolay
Woa man nigga, that's a dirty game way
I be shootin niggas since back in '08
Seein through these niggas, I can tell that they fake
New clientele, gotta catch me a plate
I'm 2 seconds ahead, you 1 second late
On that kind of money, Shawty I can't wait
Act that way, move out my way
5000 choosin, move when I say
I ain't sparin no niggas, tryna fuck it
And I run my way, no way Jose
Look for me, you MIA
Shit is going up, that DOA

[Verse 2]
Flashin red flags round my Bentley rims
I come outside and I'm on CNN
Spend 2 Benjamins on my team with tams
Left the block, came back, new chain, it's me again
Versace my glasses like I'm Junior Mafia
Grindin from the bottom and I eat with mobsters
King crab legs like they chicken wings
10 model bitches at the mezzanine
BSM, I'm rich forever
I got a bad bitch, she a do whatever
I'm so club, make the bitch fuck for no cheddar
Hoes say you actin different, Rich Gang bitch I'm stackin different
Got hood rich on the west game, right after that them checks came
