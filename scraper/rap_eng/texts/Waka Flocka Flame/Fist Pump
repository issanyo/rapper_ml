Do you know where we at now? (at now)
Drinkin' bottles 'til we pass out (pass out)
They don't even know how to act now (act now)
Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air...

Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]

Baby jump around for me, bounce
Say that shit now break it down for me (down for me)
Let's hit the buckle, couple rounds with me (rounds with me)
Grab my hand, let me take you to VIP (chuck chuck VIP)
See, my life is like a movie
Patient, what the fuck is you thinkin'?
Better yet, what the fuck is you drinkin'?
Better yet, what the fuck is you smokin'?
What's hapennin'? What's up?
If you feel like me, you're fucked up, put your cup up
I'm in the club poppin' bottles, got a girl drunk
Say the instance of a fist pump
If you that call, if you that jump
Arms in the air, Shawty do the fist pump

Do you know where we at now? (at now)
Drinkin' bottles 'til we pass out (pass out)
They don't even know how to act now (act now)
Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air...

Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump

[B.O.B]
Yeah, we fuckin' up the club when we fist pump
Whole party lookin' at us crazy cause we destruct
My body showin' symptoms of liquor in my system
Her booty workin' hard like it's time to own a pension
Now listen: I'm shit-faced, I'm trashed
DY'all don't really wanna see me no more
Can't say we ain't high, ballin' like a bank shot
Fuck around, get your ego broke
Last time I was this fucked up
I swear it was a year ago
If I'm standing up when we leave the club
I'm a call that shit a miracle
Cause damn, I'm throwed
Twist up, mixed up, twist up
And her booty too big for the seats in my coupe
I'mma have to put that ass in a pick-up truck
Damn, I'm throwed
Mixed up, twist up, mixed up
And we finna' leave here with so many bad bitches
We gon have to take 'em home in the pick-up

Do you know where we at now? (at now)
Drinkin' bottles 'til we pass out (pass out)
They don't even know how to act now (act now)
Now put your fist in the air, fi-fist in the air air air air...

Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump fist pump fist pump fist pump
Now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump now fist pump
