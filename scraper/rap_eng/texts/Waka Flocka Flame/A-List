[Verse 1: Sisqo]
Imma show you how we go oh
We rollin' deep with all my people
I'm buyin' bottle after bottle
Pockets deep like we hit the lotto
Got only bitches in my section
Don't make me teach your girl a lesson
Cause if I throw a couple thousands
She'll mess around and start undressing

[Hook: Sisqo]
Oh I get the best of everything
Cribs, cars, clothes, cuz money ain't a thang
Oh I bet I'm top of my game
Way past rich cuz I'm A-List in this bitch
Said I'm A-List in this bitch
A, A-List in this bitch
I'm A-List in this bitch, a, A-List in this bitch
Yo heights can't keep with me
I'm young wild and filthy
Cuz I'm A-list in this bitch, a, A-List in this bitch
Whoa whoa
Halle Berry (A-List in this bitch)
Whoa whoa
Donald Trump (A-List in this bitch)
Whoa whoa

[Verse 2: Sisqo]
Imma show how we go oh
She drinkin' Rose and Pink Moscato
Everywhere I go she follow
But she ain't better than my model
(Ay listen)
My girl got labels on her back
She got La Perla on her ass
Cuz if to [?] me on the dash
We always first we never last

[Hook: Sisqo]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]

Get paid to party
Smoke like I'm Marley
Drink Bale Air like a boss do
Rose my bottles don't drink Bacardi
Drink been Bacardi clock the [?] like Jada Marcie
Hood nigga, popping champagne

Spent a hundred racks and put three letters in my damn change
Just do it big like [?]
Get booked for shows
Just while we out then go insane
Let my dreds swang
I'm A-List in this bitch, in the VIP with your favorite rapper
Ask about me I'm certified still in the streets with your favorite trappers
I'm walkin' nigga, walk in the club with a hundred niggas, no ID, no patdown, fuck security
I bet a nigga won't try me
Facts nigga, filthy rich, just on these bottles spent racks nigga
Standin' on the couch, blowin' on the strain, I'm turned up to the max nigga (WAKA FLOCKA, FLAME)
