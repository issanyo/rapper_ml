[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I woke up this morning too turnt' up, my nigga, I be balling
Pink slip shawty, I don't do no fucking lease
Niggas dry snitching, want to run to police
Put it on my niece, you gon' die before me
I put that on the G, Grove Street nigga
Where I'm from, we don't brag if we catch a body nigga
That's just life
Real shit, nigga, that's just life
Watch out for your friends when they got a knife
Blood brothers, me and Wooh Da Kid
Run up over here, no more hard year
Six millions, that's real shit
I'm on my squad shit, flex, go hard, bitch

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
They know my war stories, niggas know me
Walk up dumping, [?] me
Everybody killers, where are the bodies?
In the hood, where you could find me
Blood brothers in the club, it's a movie
My hood, you can call it grimy
Lights, camera, action
Center of attention, mention Wooh Da Kid and Flocka
That's a bad decision

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
B.O. Flame, family above money
Loyalty spelled backwards, Waka Flocka Flame
Want to wear my chain, want to drive my car, want to fuck my bitch
All in my business, get off my dick
Niggas bullshitting
I got that sack right now
Niggas bullshitting
First strap, thank you to my brother, Wooh
Everything green, pussy, soo woo
I built it nigga, watch me break this nigga
I'm one grateful nigga, all I did, you ain't thankful nigga?
I'm from Riverdale Road, Grove Street
Last time that I checked, they know O.G.'s

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid]
All I know is grind, 25/8
Like fuck it I need it now, niggas can't wait
Knife or the pistol, let you choose your fate
Neighborhood buzz, I'm moving state to state
Wooh Da King in this motherfucker
Heavy metal, three chains in this motherfucker
Flocka Flame, that's just my blood brother
Could never be pussy, I got a gangster mother
Most of these niggas fake, the rest is iffy
Could even null around, niggas won't tempt me
Hole in his head, I guess he lost his mind
And he thought he was a winner when he crossed the line

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
