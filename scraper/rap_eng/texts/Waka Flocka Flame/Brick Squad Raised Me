[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Underground rap, call that shit Flocka trap
Last time I checked, shawty I can't fucking rap (so?)
Falsifying facts, lying in your fucking raps (liars!)
That ain't 100, I keep it 200
Brick Squad in this bitch, move back nigga
Go hard like the '98 Shaq, nigga
Cock back put your brains in your lap, nigga
I'm high, I'm drunk, I'm rolling (rolling)
' 09 Benz but the bitch stolen (stolen)
One passenger, yeah that's a young nigga
Know one thing, just go dumb nigga
[?] Ru's go to Cali
Rock red Chucks, nigga fuck them Bally's (Su Woo!)
Know real Bloods go hard and rally
Never have shit, give a fuck 'bout this ice
Run up on Flock, better ask for your life
Got three jobs, trap, rock, roll dice
Nice like Mike, just to slow down, mix the codeine and Sprite
Ross, Waka Flocka, that's a real good hype

[Verse 2: Frenchie]
Niggas acting like they ready for the drama
I got a llama, call it Jeffrey Dahmer
Queens is the place that raised me
I'm a dog with no rabies
Get your head bust fucking with a gangsta
Fuck apologies, I'll spank ya
I ain't ever been scared in my life
So Icey Boys is the movement, right?
Let a nigga front, I'm taking his stripes
Bought a 10-speed fucking with Triple C's
I'm a hundred, nigga on my B's
All I know is cock, aim and squeeze
Breathe...
You didn't get a chance to leave (Yeeeeeah!)
Brick Squad is the clique I'll die for
Waka, that's my brother from a different mother
Wooh Da Kid mixtape out doing numbers
If a nigga front, I'ma put him under
Brick Squad! Yeeeeeah!

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a whole lotta money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep popping while them bad hoes jocking
