[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & Slim Dunkin]
You trying to rob? Nigga, I be on that same shit
You trying to juug? Nigga, I be on that same shit
You in the hood? Nigga, I be on that same shit
Oh, that's your girl? Might catch me with the same bitch
You trying to rob? Nigga, I be on that same shit
You trying to juug? Nigga, I be on that same shit
He on the same shit, she on that same shit
I claim the same clique, Brick-fucking-Squad, bitch

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin]
Same coke from yesterday, still fly from yesterday
Get high, we still high from yesterday
Give a fuck what a nigga say, same old extended K
Same nigga robbed your baby mama on Mother's Day
Me and Waka bust the same time with the same hoe
Oh that's your girl? My bad, shawty I ain't know
You cuffing that cat? That bitch a alley rat
He hit it from the front, I hit it from the back
I skeeted on the same pillow you lay your head at
The same place you and your girl go to bed at
She want a sugar daddy, the way that you did
I said: "Silly rabbit, tricking for the kids"

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
They say they looking for a hood-ass down south nigga
I say: "Why not call up Waka Flocka Flame ,nigga?"
Earrings, chains, and rings, nigga
Emmitt got me iced out
Gucci got me balling out
The studio in my trap house
Smoke good weed, rolling off a half of pill
They going to say a nigga balling 'cause I signed a record deal
Your main bitch keep on calling 'cause she love the way my dick feel (three things)
Drill her, kill her, but never will I eat her
Why not fuck with him?
Ice on the neck got niggas like: "Get him"
Reach for my chain, shawty, Flocka might kill him
One mixtape, now the whole hood feel him
Shawty sell bricks, we on the same shit
Shawty flip pounds, we on the same shit
Shawty got beans, we on the same shit
Smoke by the ounce, we on the same shit
