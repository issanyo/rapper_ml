[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Real nigga, no flex
Flooded out my rolex
I can't pull up on you nigga, you ain't talking no check
Youngin run up in your trap nigga where the dope at?
They gon' find you pussy niggas, somewhere where there no strap
Used to be a capo now bitch I'm a CEO
That shit you talking, not though, you niggas just like CB4
I know she a nympho but she think I'm the shit though
Reaching for my dick but she squeezing out my pistol

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Balling like I'm in the league, shootin' pull up in fatigue
I just might pull up for three, she wanna bus' it for me
Balling like I'm in the league, shootin' pull up in fatigue
I just might pull up for three, she wanna bus' it for me
Balling like I'm in the league, balling like I'm in the league
Balling like I'm in the league, I just might pull up for three
Balling like I'm in the league, balling like I'm in the league
Balling like I'm in the league, I just might pull up for three

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hard in the down pay, purple in my damn drank
Running through the money like I'm tryna pull a hamstring
BIP my locker room, I spent it all on champagne
Waka Flocka for president, they fucking with my campaign
Sell a nigga elbows, gangsta rock your shell toe
Drop the check on slawson then fuck it up on malrow
Balling like the major, hoping they call me they're favourite
All my niggas taking shot, we don't leave no chasers

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Balling like I'm in the league, shootin' pull up in fatigue
I just might pull up for three, she wanna bus' it for me
Balling like I'm in the league, shootin' pull up in fatigue
I just might pull up for three, she wanna bus' it for me
Balling like I'm in the league, balling like I'm in the league
Balling like I'm in the league, I just might pull up for three
Balling like I'm in the league, balling like I'm in the league
Balling like I'm in the league, I just might pull up for three
