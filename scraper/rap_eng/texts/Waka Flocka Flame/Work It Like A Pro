Lil shawty, won't you work it, twerk it?
Break your back, arch your back like a pro
She do acrobatic tricks on that pole
Centre of attention, all eyes on you, this your show
Lil shawty, won't you work it, twerk it?
Break your back, arch your back like a pro
She do acrobatic tricks on that pole
Centre of attention, all eyes on you, this your show

[Verse 1: Giggs]
I'm with Wak in the place, got a bunch of green
I'm with Brick, I'm with Ace, I'm with Uncle Steve
Fuck a flashy suit, we're a bunch of Gs
Just a T-shirt, jumper, jeans
Drop it to the floor, make that pussy drop
Take it back to mine, watch that pussy pop
Is that pussy safe? No, that pussy's not
I don't even know what that pussy's got
Pussy stunner, posey stunner
AJ jeans, Dolce jumper
Wanna shoot and miss? You a dopey dumper
The way I switch flows, vocal jumper
I'mma fuck her for it, I ain't fussy for it
When that pussy's wet, I'm a sucker for it
Call me Lion King, turn Mufasa for it
Wanna sell that pussy? Then I buss her for it

[Hook: Waka Flocka]
Lil shawty, won't you work it, twerk it?
Break your back, arch your back like a pro
She do acrobatic tricks on that pole
Centre of attention, all eyes on you, this your show

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
I love long hair
Lock me in a room with two girls, truth or dare
The fuck if I care? Ain't no love over here
Drink in my cup with the weed in the air
Chill in her gear, Hermès she wear
£20,000 yellow [?] in my hair
Hop in that Rari, I'm switchin' that gear
Real street nigga, ain't no snitch over here
Always turned up, I can't turn down
Turn down for what?
If you split, I'll buy you a butt
Buy you some breasts, throw money up
Twerk-twerk-twerk-twerk girl for these bands
Work that pole, I'm the man
What's your plan? Who you with, girl?
Yo friends who gon' call you to the motherfucking ends
£1000, £2000, £3000, £5000
I'mma make it rain for £10,000
All you see is purple 20 dollar bills on the ground
Fucking with Giggsy, the realest in town
Smoke up the pound, loving them sounds
Disrespect, get your brother man down
I fuck with South London, don't get phased out
