[Verse 1:]
Got some piece
A piece of mine
I don't want no chick
I ain't got no time
Wasn't 100
Always actin' funny
Getting nothing from me
Only in it for the money
When I tried to leave
You always got me back
Throw the pussy on me
No I couldn't say no to that
That's okay
Now I know
Beat your ass
Adios!

[Chorus:]
It's about time you let a nigga move on
Saw my ex bitch
I'm like
I'm like moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
That I moved on
That I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on

[Verse 2:]
Mad at me cause I ain't trippin'
Mad at me cause I got bitches
Doing too much for attention
You be getting off your feelings
Can't take this shit no more
This is not what I signed up for
What the fuck do I look like
Fuckin' with, dealin' with a bitch like you
I will keep on this until she's gonna stop
I got hella bitches, i mean a lot
Looking, moving and passing on all this thots
No drama, I don't know why
Get off my face
Get out of my way
I see that you're mad cause I moved on

[Chorus]
It's about time you let a nigga move on
Saw my ex bitch
I'm like
I'm like moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
That I moved on
That I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on

[Verse 2:]
My old bitch is mad as fuck
Cause my new bitch is bad as fuck
Gotta gang all this hoes
I wanna take them off these clothes
They wanna sit on my lap, sitting like on nut
God damn, and it's great to be the boss
I think lord made me to have a source
And I see you calling
I ain't picking up
You see a nigga balling
And I'ma live it up
You hate to admit it
But a nigga did it better
I know you're trying to front it with your sick bandana
You seem never here with them than me in vip
You turning on the tv and we're on tvs
So it's not because of me that a nigga moved on
You can't hold on to memories too long
You said that I'm wrong
But I'm gone
I swear i'm in my zone girl i'm on
Tell the judge I'ma be out of the city
Seem like i'm getting away
Yeah, now we really in this , bitch
Yea Yea Flocka really living it
This a new chapter
You are an old book
And judging by the cover
You are old look
I'm moved on, baby gotta be free
So please keep it moving on your CD

[Chorus:]
It's about time you let a nigga move on
Saw my ex bitch
I'm like
I'm like moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Cause I moved on
Lord knows that I, that I moved on
That I moved on
That I, that I moved on
I see that you're mad cause I moved on
