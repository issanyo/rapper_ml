[Verse 1]
I'm liquored up, I'm drunk as fuck
I'm pulling over, I had enough
I'm feeling her, she feeling me
I'm living life like a movie
Waka, stop, shawty, freeze
Take a picture, say cheese
East side, west side
South side and north side, let's ride
Let's get it popping, let's go to work
Every weekend in the club, smoking big purp
Now it's Sunday, they yelling out, "Boy, go to church"
I'm so tired, I'm like, "Damn it, I can't go to church"
It's Waka Flocka, last name Flame
I do my thing when you see me, mane
Blood here, Blood there
Down south gutter music, it's our fucking year

[Hook]
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life

[Verse 2]
It's 12 o'clock, now it's showtime
OG Gucci said, "Flocka, boy, get on your grind"
I stopped trapping, now I'm rapping, so it's time to shine
I keep sweating, now I'm dizzy, boy, I'm finna die
Hoes, they finna cry 'cause they want my number
Vacations for the summer, my first ride in a Hummer
I know I had to make it, keep it real and never fake it
Brick Squad clique, so stop all that player hating

[Hook]
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life

[Verse 3]
Get the guap, chew the guap, digest the guap
Run up in your house with a mask and Glock
Disrespect the clique, you gon' die this year
Gucci Mane La Flare AKA the polar bear
Frenchie flow retarded, all that nigga get is stares
Wooh da Kid, shawty, he gon' shoot you like a deer
Young Juiceman busting bricks all year
Waka Flocka Flame got the hood like:
"Flocka, Flocka, Flocka
Waka, Waka, Waka, Waka, yeah"

[Hook]
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
I'm just living life
Shawty, I'm just living life
