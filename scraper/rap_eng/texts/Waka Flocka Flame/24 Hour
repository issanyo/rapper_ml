[Intro]
I be like, I be like
We be flexing with the check, grindin'

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
24 hours, still blowing strong
I want the money and the power bitch I been in my zone
Bitch I been in my zone, hater leave me 'lone
I get money by myself you know kush is my cologne (x2)

[Verse 1]
I play Sosa you Montana, you niggas not my type
I'm a get money nigga shawty all my bitches dyke
I know your background boy you ain’t really right
Flexing like you chirping you ain't never sell that white
MC Gusto ass rapper  shawty you ain’t 'bout that life
24 hours, that’s all a nigga need to get the money and the power
Bitches on my dick, I’m from Clayton County, Georgia
Grew up selling ??
Everybody head-busting, plotting on a lick
For let you out of cast serve your ass a dummy brick
These hoes ain't nothing and these the bitches ain’t shit
They fucking for some red bottoms and an outfit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I be doggin' these hoes I’ll pass ‘em to my bruh
Chaz off the chain he don’t fuck with no lame
Stay to myself cause these niggas always change
Kicked them out the clique now we screaming out they changed
24 year old nigga I can never scream your name
Shout out to some real niggas from the damn belaine
Them boys say they’re robbing we on the same thang
My young boys crazy they'll bust your brain
Waka Flocka Flame you can call me Ric Flair
I'm rocking five chains and I'm lit up like a flair
My dogs selling dope where he sleep he don’t care
I want the money and the power the rest don’t care

[Hook]
