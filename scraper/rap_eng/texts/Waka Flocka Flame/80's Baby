[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Your girlfriend say I'm crazy baby 'cause my earings cost me 80
In the trap with Radric Davis, you know I'm an 80's baby
She a 80's baby, he a 80's baby
We some 80's babies, shoutout to my 80's babies

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
I was born a rap general, not Grady baby
'87, 80's baby
22 on 28's, got the Cutlass looking crazy
A nigga say I'm young and dumb
And act like I don't give a fuck
Guess them 80's got a nigga feeling like I'm super buck
Old niggas be scared of us
'Cause we keep that pistol tucked
Ain't no one-on-one
Since the 80's we been quick to bust
We corrupted the world like that heroin and that white did
The trap house is our playground
We don't play with nothin but white kids

[Verse 2: Dae Dae]
Waka born in '86, Slim was born in '87
I was born in '86, D-Bo born in '87
Eighty niggas, eighty whips
Eighty pistols, eighty clips
Eighty niggas scream So Icey, Brick Squad when we hit the strip
'87 Oldsmobile, twenty-four inch low-pro wheels
Eighty bitches choosing Dae Dae on a party pack of pills
Yeah I'm So Icey baby, you already know the deal
Fuck with me the long way, bitch you know what time it is

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Your girlfriend say I'm crazy baby 'cause my earings cost me 80
In the trap with Radric Davis, you know I'm an 80's baby
She a 80's baby, he a 80's baby
We some 80's babies, shoutout to my 80's babies

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
80's baby, woo, crazy baby, woo
Mama raised you, raised by the streets woo
Grimey like a gravy baby, Slim, but I ain't Shady baby
Run them things from Seven Mile to Decatur baby
'87 Monte Carlo, got them sixes skating baby
Dunking on them haters, and I got them bitches going crazy
Rico in the eighty, got the trap full of purple hazey
Paid in full, money talk and bullshit walk, it's time to pay me

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rock more ice than Wayne and Baby
80's made me, 90's raised me
Year 2000 fucking made me
'Cause I fucked, you not my lady
Wilding like she got my baby
Hell nah bitch you cannot play me
Wild as fuck, I'm from the 80's
No I'm not your Grady's baby
Flocka he a New York baby
End up like a migo baby
Dreads like a Marley baby
Chopper like a Harley baby
Eighty deep, one-sixty feet
Don't get stomped out and beat to sleep
Damn near to the white meat
Do the right thing like Spike Lee

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Your girlfriend say I'm crazy baby 'cause my earings cost me 80
In the trap with Radric Davis, you know I'm an 80's baby
She a 80's baby, he a 80's baby
We some 80's babies, shoutout to my 80's babies
Your girlfriend say I'm crazy baby 'cause my earings cost me 80
In the trap with Radric Davis, you know I'm an 80's baby
She a 80's baby, he a 80's baby
We some 80's babies, shoutout to my 80's babies
