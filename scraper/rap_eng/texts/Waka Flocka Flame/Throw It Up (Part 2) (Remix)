Ay, ay, yo!

It's Pastor Troy mothafucka', that's me!
It's BME! Drama Squad!
And when I come I'm comin' hard
I represent for GA, to [?], to the bay
I'm in the club signed up with a bitch, I'm chillin'
Better watch who you mug and fuck all that grillin'
It's the Pastor Disaster, I blow up like a missile
We can do it with hands man, or do it with pistols
It's whatever, I'm ready, couple blunts and it's on
Give a fuck if I'm right, give a fuck if I'm wrong
This is not just a song, this the anthem for Crunk!
We don't do this for pussy niggas, don't do it for punks
And once again; Nigga put some 'yac in my mug!
Huh! So I can throw it up!!!
Well uh huh!
