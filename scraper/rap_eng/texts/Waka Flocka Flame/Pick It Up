Pick it up (x5)
Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain (flex!)
20s 50s 100s, bitch I'm ballin' LeBron James
(3!) Pick it up
Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Swiss) Pick it up
(Squat!) Money flyin' in the air
Make it rain!
(Flex) 20s 50s 100s bitch I'm ballin' D. Wade!

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Hol', nigga, what did you want?
How could I help ya?
Play with me, chase yo ass, fast
Leopard, get, get em
Catch her down bad burn ya up desert
Bad bitch pickin' up ones
She was German, no shepherd, woooh
She gon' suck me to sleep, oh mi gosh, a freak!
Whatcha wanna eat? Take ya to McD's
All four pockets got cheese
And I'mma B, L, O O D
Shoutsout to OG, hop in the fleet
So much sand on me, I look like I'm on South Beach
Been a few weeks, I ain't even been to sleep
I'm just bitin' down on my teeth
I got mollies that stack like a mountain
We can get ski'd as we get geeked
1 0, 1 7, down with them, yeah, they with me
If you play inside these streets
You gon' make looser of the week
Bleaw!
