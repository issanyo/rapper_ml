[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
If I front his ass a pack, and he run off with the work
I’ma send the young'uns at him, he gon' get his ass murked
Off with his head, off with his head
Heard he talking shit about me, when I see him we gon' bust
We don’t do no fuckin' talking, in the squad, I trust
Off with his head, off with his head

[Verse: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shoot in the club like I’m Sean, beat a nigga ass in the alley
Nigga won’t LA me, how the fuck a robber gon' sue me?
What the fuck this world coming to?
One deep, strapped with my boo
No hesitation, she gon' shoot
Red bottom, her shoes
[?] on her back, zip 'em up, that’s a black bag
Shoot first, put it on my flag
Elm Street, shawty, Piru
[?]
For them 3, I’m gon' shoot
3 deep plus Jay, Wooh
With them chopsticks, we a fool

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse: Bloody Jay]
[?] on your head (We will) Ooh. [?] Talk to 'em
Off with his head, whole lot of blood
Get shed, blood, ice and it's red
Pressure, blood pipes, some niggas get scared
All I'm fearing is the Feds
Matter fact, fuck the Feds
Round Rico, [?] the nino
Matter fact you are uno
Before you get a dose
Molly, lean, the antidote
Quick to let that hammer go, where the ammo go
In about to get a lit up in a ho
3 more, free row
Been taken, 3 word, super soaked, red shirt
Waka with me, red shirts, big B like the red socks
I will leave that one shot, bang, headshot

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse: Wooh Da Kid]
My strap cold, run it man, we ball, that shit hammer time
We bumming up on the referee, [?] we feeling fine
Off with your H-E-A-D, you fuck nigga
My young nigga just 5'2", so no need to duck nigga
Bought a pistol, you bring it
Wooh Da Kid, my name, bitch
What the fuck is you thinking?
Elm Street what I bang, bitch
Thugging like Pac in the 9-oh
In the home with you want 9 hoes
Swearing on Christ and I put it on my life
At the same time fuck 9 hoes
My young boy got young boys
Don’t fuck around and die young boy
My young nigga, he's 16, he walk around with that gun, nigga
If I front you a pack, better bring it back
Off with your head, can’t get it back
Hit it then click then you hear a crack
Off with your brain like [?]
