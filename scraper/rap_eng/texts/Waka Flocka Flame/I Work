[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Aye, French, fam
What we tell these niggas, man?
So Icey Boys, man
The new N.W.A., man
We back, nigga
This Waka Flocka, nigga
LeBron Flocka James, nigga
Huh, huh, Flocka!
Man... this shit easy, man
We really, like, really do this gangsta shit, man
So Icey Billionaires, So Icey Trillionaires, man
So Icey Fetty Boys

[Hook: Frenchie]
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
It's So Icey in the building
Trapping in the A like I'm in front of my building
I'm about to make a million
Internationally known, that's with women and children

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hauling them beans and trapping all night
Shawty, man, I'm really about that shit
Re-rock my brick [?]
Splits in the ounces [?]
Dimes and nicks, gram that
Call that shit T-Mac
Flexing in the trap, lay you on your back
40 deep in this trap, nigga
So please don't try to rob us
Goddamn, y'all want these problems
Lit his ass up when I squeeze the pump
Red rag around my neck and face
I ain't trying to catch no 'nother case
Rearrange that fuck nigga's face
That's how I was raised by BeBe and Joe
Shoot for the waist, won't [?] to the fade
In the club, taking them shots to the face
Flocka really never had shit
Wanna be cool with a Lambo?
Going from a family like a Rambo?
Put that on Raleigh's moms and Travis Scott
R.I.P., R.I.P
I'm a G, in these streets
Riverdale, TCP

[Hook: Frenchie]
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
It's So Icey in the building
Trapping in the A like I'm in front of my building
I'm about to make a million
Internationally known, that's with women and children

[Verse 2: Frenchie]
I'm killing it now, from New York to the A
How many bricks can I sell in a day?
It feels like my life is running away
Before you catch it, I'm gunning away
Born a soldier, dipped in the Rover
Cops in my rearview, pulling me over
Here come the dogs, but it is not over
Listen, I'll probably stash it away
Too loud, disturbing the neighbors
I be getting this paper
Since you was crawling in Pampers
And since your mama that raised ya
Make them slow it down, I can change Miami weather
I'm a polar bear, this mean that I'm frozen now
Red Chucks, G-code, riding Bentley V
I know real niggas wearing blue, throwing up them C's
If you know real niggas, better mention me
I'll send my nigga Stu for a half a key

[Hook: Frenchie]
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
I work, I work, I work, I work
I go hard, I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
It's So Icey in the building
Trapping in the A like I'm in front of my building
I'm about to make a million
Internationally known, that's with women and children

[Outro: Frenchie & Waka Flocka Flame]
I work, I work
I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
I work, I work
I go hard, swear to God I'm a problem
What we tell these niggas, man?
So Icey Boys, man
The new N.W.A., man
We back, nigga
This Waka Flocka, nigga
LeBron Flocka James, nigga
Huh, huh, Flocka!
Man... this shit easy, man
We really, like, really do this gangsta shit, man
So Icey Billionaires, So Icey Trillionaires, man
So Icey Fetty Boys
So Icey Boys!
