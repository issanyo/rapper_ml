[Chorus:]
Ain't no tellin, what imma do
Where I hit my head
Ain't no tellin, what imma do
Where Ii tie my wrist
With the dope I wanna brick
Damage them like I’m rich
Ain’t no tellin, how much I made out when hit a list
Ain’t no tellin nigga, ain’t no tellin nigga [x4]

[Verse 1:]
You know
Hit them in they head with the forty
Ain’t no fool is on my payroll
Best they get for sending Yago
Money rolls they make
My geezy, the youngest they go pay
Fuck you pig, you know I’m working
Running my wrist, that’s the new esty money

[Verse 2:]
Kill a man now, how he’s my snitch
Big on this flocka, big on my Glock boy
Tell me no way, the weed in my nuts
Dope in my socks, when they broke out
Shoot in they house, what the fuck you mean?
Make me a dream, wish for my team
Yell over there, when you hear nigga lean
Put you on my Glock, and a red beam

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Put up form, I fucked your hoe, you were born
Put it to his head, he was stone
Why I say, still torn, I stripping of my Cunnigan
Roll it in my wrist, I will burn again
Young nigga Wiggidie, Eminem, efferent
On the hip, ask him, ask him, all I want to get to hit
Red rag, handkerchief, hanging on the right side
These niggas swing proof by, shooting at them
Ain't no tellin, life is sicker than
These niggas up in your crib
Ain’t no tellin them, it’s some big case you’ll tell me
Play with my money, and I will have to pull up to your momma

[Chorus]
