[Verse 1: Sizzle]
She gon' sell her soul just to live another life
I'ma fuck her friend too on another night
Flew that bitch out
Her friend on another flight
I been killing bitches, dick all in they overbite
Used to love a ratchet bitch, I got another type
Money make a nigga shine, I can play the light
First time I seen fuzzy fell in love with ice
Swear I'm balling like a bitch mother fuck a price
Bitches still sucking dick for that Benni rice
Been killing shit now they know the kid nice
Money over bitches like a nigga Suge Knight
Strong hoe the money like a nigga Suge Knight

[Hook: Sizzle and Waka Flocka Flame]

Niggas mad but I'm lit and yo bitch watchin'
Whoa Kemosabe, nigga you just baller blockin'

Tails on your main bitch, I need that sloppy toppy
Me and Sizzle been the shit

Tell you call your main bitch I need that sloppy toppy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'ma pull up on you niggas, I'ma flex up on these hoes

If it's really like that, pussy meet me at my show
I'ma shoot out all on niggas laugh about it pour a four

Hundred round clip, I don't need no fucking scope

[Hook: Sizzle and Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame & Sizzle]
Called AP phone now my neck is rocky
Got a trap out in Durham, got a trap in Raleigh
Some like Ferrogamo with all these bloods around me
