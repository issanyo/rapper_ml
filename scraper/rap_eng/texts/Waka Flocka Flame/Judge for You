[Chorus]
They tell you to be yourself and when you do, they judge you
They tell you to be yourself and when you do, they judge you

They tell you to be yourself and when you do, they judge you
Tryina push my niggas through this industry
All this shit we going through, put my nieces, nephews and my lil' cousins through school
Soundscan checks coming in my future plan through
They judging me of interviews, never of the good shit
Always pinpointing bad shit, fucking critics, hate 'em
Criticizing all the niggas life, get your own life
Why every time I turn my back a friend grab a knife?
Damn these drugs talking to me, telling me I need some more
Till a nigga OD shaking now I'm on the phone
Thinking about my past life and all the crazy shit I did
Devil and Jesus Christ can't go on, do this right

Don't never let 'em get the best of you, best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you, best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you

[Chorus]

Words can't alter my ego so bulletproof
Hard in da Paint went double platinum
No Hands went triple platinum
Damn, I do a number, dog, calling me ranker
Treat it like a hood club, standing on a bar top, 30K for a walk in
I say this is life, I remember I couldn't have 30 dollars in my pocket, shit
Robbing for some small change, tryina make a big name
In a small town, Riverdale we in this bitch, man
Only God could judge me
Fuck what another person gotta say about me, I'm stress free

Don't never let 'em get the best of you, best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you, best of you
Don't never let 'em get the best of you

[Chorus]

You see me, man, I started from the motherfucking bottom
Man, I already knew, only thing I was looking was the top
See, I lost 80% of my friends around me, man
Damn near lost my life, you know
RIP my nigga gunned down, man, ain't shit gonna stop me, my nigga
