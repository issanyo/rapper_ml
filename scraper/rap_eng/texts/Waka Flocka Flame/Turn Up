[Intro]
Fatality
Whoo Kid
Silence
Fatality

[Chorus]
I be divin' in the crowd, shake my dreads, actin' wild
Came through lit to blow loud, too turned up, I can't turn down
I be divin' in the crowd, shake my dreads, actin' wild
Came through lit to blow loud, too turned up, I can't turn down
Can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down
Can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down
Can't turn down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Post-Chorus]
(Whoo Kid), turn up
Turn up
(Whoo Kid)
Turn up

[Interlude]
Fatality
Woo

[Verse]
I be divin' in the crowd, shake my dreads, actin' wild
Came through lit to blow loud, too turned up, I can't turn down
All I wanna do is party, my head keep on spinnin' 'round
Baby girl, why don't you bust me, drop it to the ground

[Chorus]
I be divin' in the crowd, shake my dreads, actin' wild
Came through lit to blow loud, too turned up, I can't turn down
I be divin' in the crowd, shake my dreads, actin' wild
Came through lit to blow loud, too turned up, I can't turn down
Can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down
Can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down, can't turn down
Can't turn down, down, down, down (Let's get ready to rumble)

[Post-Chorus]
Turn up
Up
Up
Turn up
Up
Up
Up

[Outro]
