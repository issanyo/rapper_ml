[Verse 1: 360]
If I want it I'm gon grab it for all the nights I ain't have shit
Pockets was on rabbits, they ain't let us get to those karats
Fresh to death in this wardrobe ima kill em with these fabrics
Splurging out on Saks Fifth it's hard to break these habits
I'm a slave to this fashion ashamed to say but I'm ratchet
Growing up without a thing and then everything comes rapid
First chance you'll flash it, flaunt it, toss it, stack it
Make it rain with rainy day stashes
My own music blasting while I'm passing you in slow mo
Care free like like promo
You got that, I must compete; I cop that like Robo
Top off like go-go this a blood sport with these blood diamonds
They blind you like Bolo
My eyes on a mule I'm waiting for my 40 acres
I ask for reparations the pass me a respirator
I'm carrying out tradition -- ancestors had on chains too
Flexing on you niggas every time I get the chance to

[Hook: 360]
I want it ALL
I want everything in this life
Money, cars, clothes and a thick wife
You hoping that we end up in them pinstripes
Since you ain't believe ima rub it in your face like
Look what I got...I want it all
Look what I got...I want it all
Look what I got...I want it all
Cuz I done came from the bottom ain't nobody gave me nothing nigga!

[Verse 2: 360]
Check me out when that check get in
Step out, see the steppers I'm steppin in
Fresher than a motherfucking peppermint
5 star spots you ain't never been
I can't wait I need it now tryna walk before I crawl
Run up on your bitch ass like - I want it all
I want it all I don't want the store I want the mall
Vanity you lose your sanity just tryna ball
Tap into my savings and go on a little shopping spree
Never had much so a little is a lot to me
Gas gage approaching E...But I got them J's tho
I ain't even pay my rent...But I got them J's tho
Stood online for bout a week...But I got them J's tho
Maybe later right now I ain't tryna change, ho
Polo this and Polo that yeah I'm on my high horse
Everybody gon think I'm broke -- yeah I'm on my Shad Moss
I was like 21 with a bunch of money
Blew it all; looking back it, I was a fucking dummy...Damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 360]
Thousand dollar garments sweating out my arm pits
Don't know why I buy it, my conscience say it's nonsense
Can it be the vanity that got me hating my family
Or you mad cuz all them hoes that ran from you, ran to me

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
I want more money- more cars- more clothes
More bitches- less friends- more foes
Stunting on em- how long- Lord knows
I'm paid now- And I'mma let it all show
I want it ALL

[Hook]
