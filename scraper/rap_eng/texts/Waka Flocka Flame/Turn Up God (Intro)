Do you ever fuck Black women?
Or is it mostly Asian and White?
Yeah, I fucked Black chicks before
You have, yeah
But you're more into White chicks and Asians, right?
Yeah, I like, you know
They just suck dick easier (Yo)
Hahahaha
Black chicks don't suck dick, you know what I'm sayin'?
They more respectful
Hahahaha, they have more dignity
And who wants a chick with dignity?
Yeah, yeah (Oh my God)
