[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm out here
Bitch, I'm out here
I bees in the trap bitch I'm out here
I'm sending a hunnid packs bitch I'm out here
We seek to dirty game, they ain't playing field
Pay a front with a [?]
Bitch, I'm out here
Bitch, I'm out here
Two bricks of molly for these diamonds in my ear
You niggas just rapping, ya'll not out here
Drums on the handguns, we ain't play field
Nigga we can take a deal
Pounds in the dashboard, pounds in the speaker
Tell the plug to call me, I get the game cheaper
I'm cooking up dough but all of my hands are pot
For the land 2 years I supplied the block
Red, blue, white lights that's the fucking cops
Rule number one shawty, don't fuck with opps
I'm cooking up dough but all of my hands are pot
For the land 2 years I supplied the block
Call my ese from the south side
He the reason why we eating nigga, I'm the mob
Only rapper rapping, I'm a bad boy like I'm black raw
Of course I take more shots than a college bar

[Hook]
Whip game done made a lot of nigga rich
Whip game got me walking out with yo bitch
Whip game rollie cost more than a brick
Whip game got my young niggas with the shit
Whip game got me going hard in designer
Whip game got me blowing fresher Cali fire
Whip game got me pulling up with a foreign
Whip game got me on the road like I'm touring

[Verse 2]
Whipping up the yola
Ship it off to North Dakota
IPhone 6, my trap phone a Motorola
On a hotline like nigga, "What's the hold up?"
Playing with my money hit em with the super sucka
Paints on baby red on a new Ferrari
Me and coke got it looking like I'm on safari
Put it in the a pot, remix it like a song
Nigga, we don't sleep, we too busy putting it on
All squad shit, I'd rather get to the business
These niggas broke gotta focus on the bitches
Put it in the pot, I'ma show em how to whip it
Put it in the pot, I'ma show em where to ship it
Money stretch out real good like gymnastics
All up in the kitchen got me feeling like a chemist

[Hook 2]
Whip game done made a lot of nigga rich
Whip game got me walking out with yo bitch
Whip game rollie cost more than a brick
Whip game got my young niggas with the shit
Whip game done made a lot of nigga rich
Whip game got me walking out with yo bitch
Whip game rollie cost more than a brick
Whip game got my young niggas with the shit
Whip game got me going hard in designer
Whip game got me blowing fresher Cali fire
Whip game got me pulling up with a foreign
Whip game got me on the road like I'm touring
Like I'm touring

Whip game got me like I'm fucking touring
