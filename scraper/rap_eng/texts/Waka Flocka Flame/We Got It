[Pre-Chorus: Tigo B]
When it comes to money, we got stacks up
Fifty grand every week, fuck a rap budget
We recession proof, but my trap bunking
Yeah, them Feds hate it, but boy, the hood love it
Itching for that midget, huh? (we got it, we got it)
Plenty P's of purple weed (we got it, we got it)
Bricks for that white bitch (we got it, we got it)
Stacking for that profit, pills too exotic

[Chorus: Tigo B]
Drugs (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Coke (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Purp (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Work (we got it, we got it, we got it)

[Verse 1: Tigo B]
Bitch, who knocking at my door? Homeboy, I can barely sleep
'Cause I got a lot of product and they know I keep it cheap
You just gotta hit my celly
Whip it, then it's ready
Trap house booming, put your Mary out the telly
Then it's out of here, gone, serving like a ping-pong
Potluck keep it steady, so it's here all year long
The whole city copping, so I know the people watching
So if you hit the celly, just make sure you watch your topics
We in the game, homes, this ain't no foosball
I'm talking heavy work, we might need a U-Haul
This ain't no pool hall, but I keep a 8-ball
I'm talking straight raw, this might make your face numb

[Pre-Chorus: Tigo B]
When it comes to money, we got stacks up
Fifty grand every week, fuck a rap budget
We recession proof, but my trap bunking
Yeah, them Feds hate it, but boy, the hood love it

[Chorus: Tigo B]
Drugs (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Coke (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Purp (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Work (we got it, we got it, we got it)

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Green chain, green watch, white ring, I got it
Smoking on exotic, higher than a pilot
Grade-A mid, you better hurry up and buy it
[?] every other week, high as hell, can't go out cheap
Twenty bales of mid, that's a Tay and Lex beat
Out in Raleigh, booming Sally, six-five for the county
We know some gutter Charlotte niggas screaming out, "Pine Valley"
We know some Bloods out in Durham that'll burn you like some purp
Got a dope house in Asheville, a weed house in Fayetteville
And a pill house in Greenville, trying to see a hundred mill
Mix it with a record deal, I'm balling like I'm Kobe, LeBron Flocka in this bitch
DJ Scream, I'm hood rich

[Pre-Chorus: Tigo B]
When it comes to money, we got stacks up
Fifty grand every week, fuck a rap budget
We recession proof, but my trap bunking
Yeah, them Feds hate it, but boy, the hood love it
Itching for that midget, huh? (we got it, we got it)
Plenty P's of purple weed (we got it, we got it)
Bricks for that white bitch (we got it, we got it)
Stacking for that profit, pills too exotic

[Chorus: Tigo B]
Drugs (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Coke (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Purp (we got it, we got it, we got it)
Work (we got it, we got it, we got it)
