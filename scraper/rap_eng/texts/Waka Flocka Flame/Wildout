[Verse 1]
All my shows is wild as hell, my momma say I'm wild as hell
I'ma end up in jail, I pledge allegiance to them bales
The weed is loud, can't you smell?
Real nigga in the building, shawty, can't you tell?
Bullets can't make a young nigga fail
Trapped out, bitch, I'ma do it
Young niggas, I influence
They say: "Flocka, you a role model"
Two bitches, they top models
Drinking out the bottle, swallow
(Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it)
In the club, jumping up and down
You bucking, then it's going down
Stomp your ass down to the ground
Security can't help you now
Bricksquad! I yell it, then it's going down
Hit Squad! I yell it, then it's going down

[Chorus]
Mean mugging in the club (wild out, wild out)
Fuck that shit, don't show no love (wild out, wild out)
Swing on that nigga, shawty (wild out, wild out)
The DJs say they going wild (wild out, wild out)
I'm so crunk, might dive off in the crowd (wild out, wild out)
Bricksquad in this bitch, they going wild (wild out, wild out)
Super deep in V.I.P. (wild out, wild out)
I'm so drunk that I can't see (wild out, wild out)

[Verse 2]
In the club, throwing bows
Lime flag, that's the Grove
I'm so hot, bitch, I'm on stove
In the trap, booming O's
They say: "Flocka, love your flow
In the booth, you wild out"
I ball hard, can't foul out
In the club, just wild out
On the stage in a rage, I'm in love with the sack
I'm engaged with the rap
You don't like it? Meet my strap
Your ass straight to sleep and your jewelry look cheap
I got Tay on the Beat
(Do it, do it, do it)
Told my partners on the block
Jugging weed, selling rocks
Duck and dodge the fucking cops
Keep it real, don't stop
I get money, I get gwap
Every mixtape, never stop
Lled up in a foreign drop
Just one thing: I'll wild out

[Chorus]
Mean mugging in the club (wild out, wild out)
Fuck that shit, don't show no love (wild out, wild out)
Swing on that nigga, shawty (wild out, wild out)
The DJs say they going wild (wild out, wild out)
I'm so crunk, might dive off in the crowd (wild out, wild out)
Bricksquad in this bitch, they going wild (wild out, wild out)
Super deep in V.I.P. (wild out, wild out)
I'm so drunk that I can't see (wild out, wild out)
