[Hook]
When I'm in the club, I drink all the bottles
Versace fit, feelin' like a million dollars
A hundred chains sittin' on my collar
And if you know me, you know I'm 'bout a dollar
That's all I know, that's all I know
Poppin' champagne, money on the floor
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Keep it one hundred, that's all I know
Bitches and money, that's all I know
That girl love swoop, that ain't my hoe
That is his hoe, stack up your dough
Hold up, I say, "Hold up"
Call up the waitress, we gon' pop bottles
Like this were war, we gon' turn up
That's all I know
Stay ten toes down, all in the trap
Niggas talk crazy, I be right back
Feel like Rozay, pop bottles back
Young hoes come out, wherever I'm at

[Hook]
When I'm in the club, I drink all the bottles
Versace fit, feelin' like a million dollars
A hundred chains sittin' on my collar
And if you know me, you know I'm 'bout a dollar
That's all I know, that's all I know
Poppin' champagne, money on the floor
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know

[Verse 2]
Strip clubs in Atlanta, that's all I know
When I'm in New York, [?] is all that I know
Big ass Rolls Royce, that's all I know
Wasted out in LA, tha's all I know
Hold up, I say, "Hold up"
Call up the waitress, we gon' pop bottles
Like this were war, we gon' turn up
That's all I know
Turned up in Texas like a vato
Drivin' down Collins, that's all I know
Diamonds on my necklace like a bakin' show
Stay home, keep grindin', that's all I know

[Hook]
When I'm in the club, I drink all the bottles
Versace fit, feelin' like a million dollars
A hundred chains sittin' on my collar
And if you know me, you know I'm 'bout a dollar
That's all I know, that's all I know
Poppin' champagne, money on the floor
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
