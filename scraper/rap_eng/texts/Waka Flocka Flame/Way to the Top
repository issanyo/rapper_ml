[Hook]
I grew up on the block, robbers, d-boys, and cops
In and out trend spots, trying to run my block
Stay down on my grind, can't confiscate what I got
Shine every chance I get whether you like it or not
I said the trap is hot, it ain't getting money if it ain't hot
I said the trap is hot, it ain't getting money if it ain't hot
I deserve everything I got, on my way to the top

[Verse 1]
Young nigga grew up, born from Jamaica Queens
No homes, just anger and crack fiends
Thugged out young nigga, no skinny jeans
The code was grind, get this money by any means
No in-betweens, never choose sides
Down for my niggas, you know I ride
This one for the county when the doors slide
I hear your pain dog, I hear your soul cry
No replies from his dog when he down the road
Uncle was twenty-five and he didn't fold
Just to let you know, boy, I got your books every month
Bruh you gon' be straight, that's real shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I said I stayed down strong, put my all in it
My grind showed off man they want to call in it
Acting like they helped wrote a nigga raps and all
Bitch, I showed your little ass how to ball
Never turn my back on a nigga I call a friend
Ride with you even if I know I won't win
Feel like Joe the Boss in this foggy, I've been
Rapping from the heart, I don't even need a pen
Flag out my pocket, shawty that's unity
Hear these niggas talking, boy, Dunk looking over me
Ain't shit you can do to me, trying to feed my family
Fuck all of this jewelry, party in Clayton County

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Grown man status got a nigga thinking different
Put a plan together, we're going to eat, pay attention
Trying to keep my niggas out of the kitchen, stop bitching
People pay to listen, always paid attention, play my position
Rapping from the heart, never fiction
Daddy was a Muslim, mommy was a Christian
Lost one brother, now I've got three
Laugh, I'mma be a real nigga, can't take my breath

[Hook]
