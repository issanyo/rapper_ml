Throwin' money in the air like I don't really care
And I'm standin' on the chair like I don't really care
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but, I don't really care
No I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't really care
No I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't really care
Got bitches by the pair, I'm baller of the year
And haters everywhere but, I don't really care

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka Flocka, I keep them bad bitches yellin' it
Thugged out, rich as hell plus I'm throwin' dick
Drunk as shit
Everywhere I go I'm yellin' "Bricksquad Monopoly" loud as shit
Throwin' money in the air, fuck it I don't care
50 for the earrings, that's 100 for a pair
Versace on my ass, two bands for my underwear
Foreign cars, foreign broads, baller of the year
Sparkles on my champagne, independence day
I ain't really want your number, your friend look better anyway

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Gotta stop, hol' up, too much money to fold up
Keep some green to roll up, I run it like a motor
You see the way I pull up, attention like a soldier
What you expect to happen now I'm swaggin' on the sofa?
I be so reckless, spend a hundred thou' on my necklace
That mean my shit is colder, my neck froze, polar
Bear nigga yeah, baller of the year
And we can take it there, nigga, I ain't never scared
