[Hook: Bo Deal]
If I fuck wit' Keef, I can't fuck wit' Rico
I fuck wit' Herb, I can't fuck wit' Durk
Fuck wit Samson can't fuck wit' Reese
Can't fuck wit' Louie my city hurt
If I fuck wit' Fredo, can't fuck wit' Duck
Fuck wit' E, I can't fuck wit' Chuck
If I fuck with Bump I can't fuck wit' Cam'
Safe to say that my city fucked
Fake niggas say that I'm oppin', stop it
Fuck it then I'm oppin', pop me
I ain't boppin' I'm oppin', stop me
I'm supportin' my city
Pop ya' pussies say that I'm oppin'
When I'm oppin' and they can't stop me
I'm a opp nigga quit woofin' at me, when you see me then pop me

[Verse 1: Bo Deal]
If you think that I'm a opp, when you see me then pop me
I'm still posted on the block, still ain't no nigga done shot me
Still ain't no nigga done robbed me
I'm Mafioso like Gotti
If a nigga hatin' cuz I'm showin love tell 'em run on up and get bodied
I fuck wit' niggas that fuck wit' me I'm on a real nigga campaign
If you representin' and my city eatin' then I don't give a fuck what you claim
Alot of good niggas die young, a new homicide each day
I'm a OG so I speak my mind salute Nicky, Sly, free Bump J

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck wit' choppas I don't fuck wit' pistols
When my shootas' shoot they won't fuckin' miss you
Need mines on top in the fuckin' gristle
Since you fucked wit' me I don't fuck wit' you
I don't swap verses ain't shit free
Call me a opp? Shit you a cop
I'm a public enemy like DJ Lloyd and Chuck D, they know it's me
POW POW POWPOW POW POWPOW POW! Now ya' trap is hot
Got a Lambo, got a Phantom Ghost, got a 'Rari, my car a opp
Been shot once I ain't shell shocked
You the same pussy in that cell block
You a cellphone in a green dot
Put the Bloods on you make ya' skin pop

Squad
I don't give a fuck nigga we the opps
Couple shootas' wit' me make 'em keep a Glock
Police pull us over we don't even stop
See us in the streets and they don't even pop
They never come outside how could that be his block?
And when they do a show there be 300 cops
And when I do a show they say "Here come the opps"
I'm super decent bitch I bought a crate of Glocks

[Verse 4: Killa Kellz]
Real recognize real
Bitch niggas I ain't toleratin'
These twenty-twelve ass gangstas
These niggas fake, they imitation
Niggas say that I'm a opp? When you see me better start sprayin'
'Cuz if I catch me a opp, that'll be his final destination
I merch that on the "I" nigga, pole stay on my side nigga
Buttfuck bitches and niggas, you could call that a quiet nigga
Niggas sayin' that I flip-flopped, stop wit' all that lyin' nigga
Niggas claimin' they in these streets, stop wit' all that hidin' nigga

[Verse 5: I.L Will]
I'm K.T.G. I'm M.I.C, I'm loyal to my crew
These niggas fake like they double G's, yo' whole squad fufu
I'm Stain Gang, I'm a Komak Boy so shout-out too my dudes
All my niggas gangbang but we show respect when its due
I fuck wit' Rico Recklezz, fuck wit' Yaya White
Fuck wit' Poker Face that's true
Mix this street shit with this rap shit and have you end up on the news
Real niggas do real things if you a real nigga do you
And if showin' love make me a opp nigga when you see me then shoot

[Verse 6: Co-Still]
Right when the city got really hot
Shorties dancing they diddy-bop
Dread heads wit' steady shots
Got rap beef like Biggie-Pac
Ha, listen I'm tellin' you street credibility's really impeccable
You say I'm a opp? Holdin' my crotch middle finger to cops and the federals
This shit is incredible, niggas is rattin' some shit I would never do
I guess you a opp too 'cuz you playin' both sides like you were bisexual
These rabbits is fake, get bent outta shape witcho' inner tube meanin' in flexible
Thats' you and yo' beef boy, you focus on that while I focus on revenue

[Verse 7: Leoski D]
I ain't cuffin' that potent, but real talk I'm a boss
It was King David and Larry Hoover when everything kicked off
Black Gangster Disciples, but you don't know yo' lick
You screamin' out you a hitta', that's a lil' girl that got hit
Ya'll tunin' down them projects, locked up them real niggas
The outcome is Chiraq, shit juss' got real nigga
Shout-out my nigga (?) been 10 years folk's been gone
Im throwin' Tre's 'till I'm dead and gone, to (?) and big (?)
