[Intro: Young Scooter]
Don't nobody listen, naw
Black migo

[Hook: Young Scooter]
When a broke nigga talking man don't nobody listen, broke ass niggas stay up out my business
When a broke bitch talking man don't nobody listen, broke bitch need to stay up out my business
If you broke no convo, I went broke and had the four four
Broke again that's a no-no, keep my name out your mouth broke ass hoe

[Verse: Young Scooter]
Three baby momma's, alot of drama
Bitch play your role, you're not a starter
You're just a battery with no charger
Young Scooter I'm a street pharmist
I flex a lot niggas hate me for that
I'm on the top give a damn where you at
I run the block I supply all the crack
You embarrassing, your boyfriend ain't worth five racks
Diamond ring just to match my chain
Pay a hundred for a water I don't want no change
All the broke hoes hate cause they ain't got a thing
How the fuck can I go broke and I make cocaine

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Broke nigga talking man don't nobody listen, broke ass niggas stay up out my business
When a broke bitch talking man don't nobody listen, broke bitch need to stay up out my business
If you broke no convo, I went broke and had the four four
Broke again that's a no-no, keep my name out your mouth broke ass hoe

[Verse: Waka Flocka Flame]
If Flocka in the club than that bitch lit
This blunt cost more than your outfit
I'm from New York but I was raised in the south bitch
Keep on talking you gon' help to get your mouth fixed
Gold all in my rolly I paid 10 racks
It's a stoley you not my homie can't get shit back
Broke niggas no convo
I call Scooter he call [?] now the [?] call me [?]

When a broke nigga talking man don't nobody listen, broke ass niggas stay up out my business
