[Bridge]
All this money I be stackin'
All this, All this, All this kush that I be rollin'
All these, All these, All these cars that I be driving
I said it don't mean shit, it don't mean shit
It really don't

[Verse 1]
Ion trust no nigga
Ion trust no bitch
Ion fuck with these nigga's
Ion fuck with that bitch
She lying on that slit I swear she lying on dick
I need a boss girl with her own shit and shorty you not it
I said chad know she said ye' or no I said every gang had ran through her
I said Trey don't know her so Kirb won't know her, I see Queso ran through her
This money I be stackin' All this kush that I be smokin'
Shit all these cars that I be driving, it don't mean shit

If my nigga's can't whip it, if my nigga's can't smoke it
If my nigga's can't fuck her, then it don't mean shit

If my nigga's can't smoke it, if my nigga's can't spin it
If my dog can't drop it, chez it don't mean shit

[Bridge]
All this money I be stackin'
All this, All this, All this kush that I be rollin'
All these, All these, All these cars that I be driving
I said it don't mean shit, it don't mean shit
It really don't

[Verse 2]
She like, What you doing tonight?
I'm like, shorty call your friends, Im gone call my friends, we can all be friends
We gone party til' the mornin' this should never end
Girl fuck yo plan
We got alcohol pourin', marijuana rollin'
Leave that childish shit ass home girl you fucking with a grown man
You know brick squad parties stay turned up we never boring
You know brick squad nigga's never turnt down level on 10
I'm rappin' off the top I don't need a pen
Girl I bless you from the back say amen, I be goin' in, lame steppin' out
Every time i hit the club balls showing out

[Bridge]
All this money I be stackin'
All this, All this, All this kush that I be rollin'
All these, All these, All these cars that I be driving
I said it don't mean shit, it don't mean shit
It really don't
