[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flexing ass nigga, acting like he fucking hoes
Drinking on beer, I smell that mid on your clothes
He gon' tell me that he's balling, he gon' tell me that he's smoking
He gon' tell me that he's drinking, what the fuck this nigga thinking?
I heard that shit before
How he ball out in the mall
How he drinks 'til he fall
And he smoke 'til he blind
Plus stay with a nine
He gon' kill them if he try them
Shawty's whip on 28's
Why the fuck this nigga lying?

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me

[Verse 2: Sy Ari da Kid]
Okay, I still go hard in that motherfucking paint, nigga
Damn, your breath stinking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
Old foogazy ass rappers still hating niggas
Break his ankle on stage, we Draking niggas
North side bangers, we earthquaking, nigga
[?] to my Haitian nigga
No homo, partner, but I hang with niggas
That'll probably take your jewels like they hang with Hitler

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me

[Verse 3: Sean Teezy]
Got a Tyson style, you know the drill
Don't get your ears bit, Holyfield
I'm so for real, you ain't trapping hard
You ain't got old money, you got a old MasterCard
Lord, can I keep it one thousand?
They ain't real killers, they just like to act violent
I'll be smiling, still be wilding in my time and I'm just grinding
You a pebble, I'm a diamond, check my Stat-en Island

[Chorus: Sean Teezy]
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
Real eyes recognize real lies, trust me
I keep it one hundred
Everybody love me
