[Verse 1: Cyrano]
I see you lookin' but you trynna act cool, right?
You don't even really care what I do, right?
Probably wanna pick, probably want two, right?
Pretty girls get ugly when the mood right
Little mood light, go ahead and let it go
I don't mean to come across too sexual, oh, oh
But that ass is epic, though
Titanic saga, volcanic, hot lava
We burnin' up, I could serve it up
Like Luke, I am your father
Only if you wanna take a dip in each other's waters
Take this bedroom and turn it into a sauna

[Pre-Hook: Campa]
She's sending me drinks, I fed her one back
She said, "ay boy, you're drinking too fast"
And we can take it slow
You'll never be alone
She's telling me, it's

[Hook]
All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through
All you tonight, all you

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
If I want her, I'm a get her
Send the waitress over
Quit that bougie shit, girl
Bend that ass over
Mr. Round of Applause, I can do it with no hands
I go hard in the paint
She ain't even got a chance
Don't go by yourself, bring a couple friends
Sold out shows, all in Japan
Tell your friends I'm the man, ask your man
Drop it, wipe me down, make that ass clap, clap
Make that ass clap, clap

[Hook]
All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through
All you tonight, all you

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
If I want her, I'mma get her
Send the waitress over
Quit that bougie shit, girl
Bend that ass over
Bend that ass over
Bend that, bend that ass over
Quit that bougie shit, girl
Bend that ass over

[Hook]
All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through
All you tonight, all you
All you tonight, lift me up
All you tonight, fill my cup
All you tonight, get me through
All you tonight, all you
