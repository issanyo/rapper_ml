[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I’m always smokin’ (Waka)
Prolly drinkin’ (Flocka)
Odds are we gettin’ even
Each and every weekend (You know)
Is your love geekin’ (Huh?)
Or the drugs speakin’ (Huh?)
I roll my sleeves up, kick my feet up, fuck a cuffin’ season
When it was newer and the fights were fewer (You know)
You had no clue or cue to my maneuver (Squad)
When I’m down you gon’ lift me up (You know)
Now you pickin’ up, I’m on my way to pick you up

[Verse 2: Dylan Guthro]
The way you crashin’ over me
Come on show me everything
Cravin’ like I need it now
You know it’s on my mind
High, high, high oooo
I’m high, high, high oooo

[Bridge]
Kush so loud you can feel it in your backbone
Your backbone, your, your, your backbone
Kush so loud you can feel it in your backbone
Your backbone, your, your, your backbone
Kush so loud, ku-kush so loud
Ku-kush so loud, Ku-kush so loud
Kush so loud you can feel it in your backbone
Shit could make your head blow

[Drop]

(yup)

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Oo, you just blew my mind
Thought I knew your kind
Thought you were hard to find (Flocka)
Now you a part of time (Flocka)
Get in your car and ride
You just need a bottle wine
If I tell the truth, can you handle it? (Handle it)
If I tell-a-vision, can you channel it? (Channel it)
When I see your body I just lose control
A symphony of me and you both

[Verse 4: Dylan Guthro]
Baby you the baddest chick
With you I share all my sins
You’re everything I need right now
I’m losin’ track of time
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high

Shit could make your head blow

[Drop]

(yup)

Shit could make your head blow
