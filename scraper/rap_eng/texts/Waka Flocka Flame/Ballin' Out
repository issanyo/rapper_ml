[Intro]
They gonna say they hard, I'ma say I'm harder
They gonna say they grind, I'ma grind smarter
They gonna say they shining, but the lights is on me
Only three things: stunt, shine, and flex

[Hook]
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex

[Verse 1]
Ice neck, wrist fist, yes, I'm balling out, bitch
Tron, Goose, Ros√©, yes, I'm drunk as fuck, bitch
Balling is my hobby, stunting is my role model
Getting guap is my job and Gucci is my right hand
"Waka Flocka Flame, you my favorite rapper, bruh
Can I trap with you, bruh? Juug and cap like you, bruh?
Count stacks like you, bruh? Dress So Icey like you, bruh?
Can I flex? can I shine? Can I ride like you, bruh?"
You can do it, shawty, you can do it, shawty, grind hard
Work hard, think smarter than the average nigga
Go ball for the carriage, nigga
Marriage, nigga? Not, not, not me, my nigga
Work, work, work, my nigga
Flex, grind on these niggas

[Hook]
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex

[Verse 2]
In the trap with the yolk, got the wrap and the choke
I love weed smoke, shawty, so please let me smoke
Every rhyme a nigga wrote, I don't need no ghost writer
This that flex, this that shine, this that ball out music
We the first B-ball team [?]
PG: Frenchie, SG: Young Juice
Small forward: Wooh da Kid, power forward: Waka Flocka
Center, center: Gucci Mane
Half time, I'ma flex
We at a full court press, so you know we got blocks
Love to shoot, love to shoot like my name was Flocka Kobe
Throwing loot, throwing loot, shawty, I got hella money
Walked up in the store, asked her what she wanted
She point at shoes
She point at Flocka

[Hook]
Now I'm balling out
Flocka! I'm balling
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Now I'm balling out, now I'm balling out
Fuck Waka Flocka Flame, call me Waka Flocka Flex
