[Intro: Spark Master Tape]
I've been gone only for a while
Now the whole fuckin' world, they be bitin' the style

[Chorus: Spark Master Tape]
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built a whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn

[Verse 1: Spark Master Tape]
When I hit up the clinic, they say I'm clinically finished
I say I'm just getting started, they say I must be retarded
They said I can't live a minute shit I've been living for hours
I've been a menace a cop killin' villain never diminished the power
It's Eiffel towers and castles, battles and showers of acid tablets devour you plastic rappers, empower the masked masses, the...
King Kong Gorilla the gold spitter
Dealin' the kkilla' of coke to all the dope dealers like...

[Chorus: Spark Master Tape]
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built the whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn

[Verse 2: Spark Master Tape]
Half of my brothers on the lockdown, and a quarter 'bout to open up some shop now
Other quarter that I got'll hold the squad down, with a leader that'll shoot the whole block down
About a week ago Charlie got that access code, on your email in that brand new apple phone
We ain't been out of business we ain't as bent out of shape
But we still like you mother-fuckers that's making the cake

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Mask on blast bruh, nigga act wrong
This won't last long, you rappers don't got no back bone
You keep no debt homes, yo record be yo last song
Ain't no different I'm still creepin' like my trap phone
I know the kind of guys been stackin' since 9 to 5
My nigga told me Flocka never get a 9 to 5
We been packin' paper you can't seem to find the time
I'm switchin' sides so this pistol keep the killin' vibes
You say you married to the money she got various husbands
And I'm on that new money like Harriet Tubman
Which is scared of ya buggy

[Verse 4: Spark Master Tape]
I'm a phantom in a phantom
Ghost rider kill them with the balance
Kilo of the coco boy named her Holly Valance
Run up on the game, forty-four to keep them challenged
And a shout out to the Heron God, keeping no traces
I been heated young, killer since the seed was sprung
We gon' need to see the coffin when man all this shit is done
I'm a dogmatic, stillmatic, real static
God have the ill habits, lord help him

[Chorus] x2
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built the whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn
