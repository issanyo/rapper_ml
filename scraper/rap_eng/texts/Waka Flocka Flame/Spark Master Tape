[Chorus]
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built a whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn

[Verse 1]
When I hit up the clinic, they say I'm clinically finished
I say I'm just getting started, they say I must be retarded
They said I can't live a minute shit I've been living for hours
I've been a menace a cop killin' villain never diminished the power
It's Eiffel towers and castles, battles and showers of acid tablets devour you plastic rappers, empower the masked masses, the...
King Kong Gorilla the gold spitter
Dealin' the kkilla' of coke to all the dope dealers like...

[Chorus]
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built the whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn

[Verse 2]
Half of my brothers on the lockdown, and a quarter 'bout to open up some shop now
Other quarter that i got'll hold the squad down, with a leader that'll shoot the whole block down
About a week ago Charlie got that access code, on your email in that brand new apple phone
We ain't been out of business we ain't as bent out of shape
But we still like you mutherfukkers that's making the cake

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Mans gone blast what nigga at one
This won't last long you rappers dont got no back bone
You get no dap homes you actin through your last song
Ain't no different I'm still creepin' like my TracFone
I know that kinda guy been stackin' a 9 to 5
My nigga from the flock I'll never get a 9 to 5
We've been [?] you can't seem to find the time
We'll switch the sides and this pistol give me killin' vibes
You said you married to the money see that Mary is hungry
And I'm on that new money like Hariet Tubman
What ya' scared or ya' buggin, Better get off and get it
Let me know if you with it, I got the dope and the bitches
Mike Tyson when they robbin and they get it
Fuck showing respect, I'm out here [?] and gettin
Looking for the weed and crack, Lord I'm sorry for sinning
I'mma let you niggas finish but I'm only beginning
Waka Flocka

[Spark Master Tape]
I'm a phantom in a phantom
Ghost rider kill them with the balance
Kilo of the coco boy named her Holly Valance
Run up on the game, forty four to keep them challenged
And a shout out to the Heron God, keeping no traces
I been heated young, killer since the seed was sprung
We gon' need to see the coffin when man all this shit is done
I'm a dogmatic, stillmatic, real static
God have the ill habits, lord help him

[Chorus]
Tell em' tell em' tell em' tenkkeys in the truck
Tell em' tell em' ten felonies, run em' up
Tell em' I don't give a fuck about a runner up
That's why we bout to run on up like we just all been thunderstruck
We been a problem
Built the whole lab, talkin' at their dinner probably
Bout our whole gang and we run on anybody
Bring our own bag, we were born to gurn and not return but first the world will starve and burn
