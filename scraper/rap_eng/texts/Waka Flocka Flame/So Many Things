[Verse 1 - Waka Flocka Flame]
She don't want liquor, she just want wine
She just my kind: long hair, fat behind
They say we're intertwined, we belong together
In the club throwing money up, changing weather
G's on my sweater, all I get is cheddar
Money go-getters: Waka Flocka and 2 Timez
Gucci - sup, I said to the Haitians
Waddup Luchi. Free my nigga Zoe
40K for a show. Practice what I preach
Shawty Mane that's all I know
Triple cup styrofoam's got me walking slow
I'm smoking on reefer, me Gucci and Wiz Khalifa

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Smoking on reefer, make a bitch out
And leave her. Comment trough a speaker
Grind in my 2-seater
Cause I got a fleet-a
Send em work like it ain't a leak-a
I practice what I preach-a
If you ain't got a game, I could teach ya

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
I got a murder charge now for the tracks I murdered
Like a nigga turned around, I'm going back to work
Got a smirk on my face cause I smoke the purp
Just killed your boy boy, now they doing a search
And I ain't been lame, but tame your dame
Cause you should be ashamed how she's off the chain
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussain
I got a brink of extra change of this extra 'caine
It's crazy, Dwayne just counting strange
Me and Waka Flocka Flame on a private plane
With 2 bad ass bitches, bout to run a train
Like an organ donor, baby loan the brain

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Smoking on reefer, make a bitch out
And leave her. ? speaker
Grind in my 2-seater
Cause I got a fleet-a
Send em work like it ain't a leak-a
I practice what I preach-a
If you ain't got a game, I could teach ya
