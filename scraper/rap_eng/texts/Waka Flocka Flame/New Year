[Verse 1: Sizzle]
I been getting to the motherfucking money, stacking chips
I been balling on you niggas, I been shootin' off of Pippen
Let my niggas say I got a pint, tell 'em that I'm winning
Feeling like Iâ€™m Cam Newton, I been motherfucking winning
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't any
Said I got the bag and I motherfucking meant it
Fuck what you had, got racks like tennis (2x)
I been geeking like a motherfucker, baby come to Molly World
Walk up in this motherfucker, really rocking fox fur
Back to back [?]
Diamonds super wet like the motherfuckin dock here
Way out in Cali like "How you get the drop here?"
Pull up on them niggas [?]
Spend a whole hundred for the motherfucking New Year (2x)

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame] (2x)
Hundred bottles in the air like it's New Years
See them sparklers in the air like it's New Years
Couldn't walk a mile in my Nike Airs
Way ahead of niggas, talking light years
Brick Squad niggas, we don't play fair (4x)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Fuck with my dog then I'm comin' out the kinnel
Gun but a nigga off the rip
Gunning at them niggas talking Blood or Crip
Always got it on me, Flock don't slip
Dumping at your car even if you with your bitch
700 Block, Elm Street, won't switch
Nightmare Gang, nigga what you claiming? (2x)
Little Italy, that's Clayco
Pull up on me right now if you wanna go
Had to get this bread, I ain't talking bout a loaf
Jug me nigga, bet your eyelids closed
High in the booth, got the pilot flow
Rapping and trapping, that's hustle and flow
Strapped in the club and I thought you should know
You taking work from me? No, no, no, no

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame] (2x)
Hundred bottles in the air like it's New Years
See them sparklers in the air like it's New Years
Couldn't walk a mile in my Nike Airs
Way ahead of niggas, talking light years
Brick Squad niggas, we don't play fair (4x)
