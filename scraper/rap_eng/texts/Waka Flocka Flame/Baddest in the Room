[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Slim Dunkin]
Shawty cute, but she got piercings in her ear, face and her tongue
Cashing out them bands, that's a whole lot of ones
Tattoos on her body says she do that shit for fun
Press a bean on her tongue, she could swallow Vietnam
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Baddest in the room, baddest in the room

[Verse 1: Slim Dunkin & Derez De'Shon]
Bad bitches, put your hands up
If you the baddest bitch, stand up
Too hot, turn the fan up
Make a nigga throw them bands up
Her money talk, that's why she don't say much
True Religion jeans on her, that's why she don't pray much
You can tell from her shoes, she ain't ordinary
Girl, you be killing them
Send them to the mortuary
Red bottom her shoes, put her ass in Trues
Hair and nails did too, that ice all in them jewels
I love that stank-ass walk, that's a mean bitch
She got that good brain, she on the Dean's List
Can't feel her legs, motivation
I make that ass clap, celebration

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Slim Dunkin]
Shawty cute, but she got piercings in her ear, face and her tongue
Cashing out them bands, that's a whole lot of ones
Tattoos on her body says she do that shit for fun
Press a bean on her tongue, she could swallow Vietnam
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Baddest in the room, baddest in the room

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got a bad bitch from the PJ's
We make good love, fucking to The O'Jays
All she wants to wear is Gucci, Louis, Dolce
Versace, MÃ©nage
She stays in red bottoms with her fat ass
Full switch, little bad bitch
She says she's from Atlanta, I met her at Ruth's Chris
The way she sucked my dick, you'd think she toothless
Damn, shawty going in
Make a nigga wanna fuck her best friend
I'm one dog ass nigga
Addicted to bad bitches, my nigga

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon & Slim Dunkin]
Shawty cute, but she got piercings in her ear, face and her tongue
Cashing out them bands, that's a whole lot of ones
Tattoos on her body says she do that shit for fun
Press a bean on her tongue, she could swallow Vietnam
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Put her anywhere, she the baddest in the room
Baddest in the room, baddest in the room
