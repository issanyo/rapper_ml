I sit back thank God for everything I got
And for giving me life again when I got shot
Dreamed of being the biggest dope boy on the block
Rocks in my socks,boxes in drawers full of weed
Hit me up shawty I got everything you need
You know my game you know my team, our flag is lime green
Young niggas, 17, gone off ecstacy
Headed down the wrong path, but all I know is rock and wreck
R.I.P Trap - you know we miss you, what's to live for, why you judging me
I'mma be all I can be
I never been the same since rara, left the streets
At the carwash where a nigga tried to kill me
Rage in my eyes now they think I'm crazy
Wild animal, they need to cage me
All I need my partna's keep real with me

All I need
Is a blunt and a cup, a couple of bad
Bitches keep it real with me
All I need
A new foreign whip, soft leather, no rims just factory
All I need
Is god to have my back , accomplish all my goals before I die homie
This is all I need, FLOCKA

I just wanna know shawty why these niggas hating on me
I ain't claim to be the greatest, I'm just trying to get some money
I got tired of not having shit, fucked up shoes and
Dressing bummy I can't sell pills, weed, and gang bang all my life
Sometimes I feel like there's no way, but I'm trying to find a way
For my partners run away, before they thought they throw their life away
Trying to get some hood stripes like a referee
While these many men was on me
Fell in love with drugs you call my girlfriend ecstasy
Lord get them away from me, while critics keep on stressing me
Hip hop keep neglecting me, learn my upbringing Before you bring me down
Trying to black ball me, like I'm bobby brown
But they fell in love with waka flocka song,my words deep if you ain't tall enough you might drown

Motherfucker
All I need is a bad bitch, one blunt, one cup

All I need
Is a blunt and a cup
A couple of bad bitches keep it real with me
All I need
A new foreign whip, soft leather,no rims just factory
All I need is god to have my back ,accomplish all my goals before I die homie
This is all I need, FLOCKA!
