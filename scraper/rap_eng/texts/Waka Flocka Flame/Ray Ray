(Waka Flocka)

I ain't bullshitting, Ray Ray got a nigga straight
In the club, throwing money, that that Ray Ray cake
Ray Ray in my Glock, Ray Ray in my sock
Twelve, pull up, then I'm dumping Ray Ray at the cops
Hold up, trap
Hold up, trap
Hold on, trap
Hold on, trap
HOLD ON

(Keebo Gotti)

It's ya boy KEEBO GOTTI!

You was in that warehouse, pulling off a hit
We was playin with that change so you off it quick
Aye that hole potato, only snud nosed
You get caught, do ya time, you dun even fold
When you down that road, ya partna get ya bitch
Put her on that door, now she on that glass dick
Raise ya son up, got him out there got him hittin licks
Robbing, Mobbing, Stealin, Killing, Dealing all type of shit
Then he get shot, they say he gonna die
Now ya going crazy, asking god why
Ya partner walk back, tell ya how ya man love ya
Just remember Ray Ray dont care none bout nobody
