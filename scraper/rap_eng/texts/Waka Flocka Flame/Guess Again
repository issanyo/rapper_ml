[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ya dig? It's going down like that, that there
We finna hit you upside the motherfuckin' head with nothing but gangster music, man
Ay you, kid, I want you to hit 'em upside the head and let's take off, y'all

[Hook]
They like, "Flocka, where you been at?"
Shit, nigga, 'round the world and I been back
They say, "You need another hit, nigga, bounce back"
I'mma keep goin', I'mma show 'em that I'm 'bout that
Guess again, my nigga
I said guess again, my nigga

[Verse 1]
Flockaveli, they will never understand it
Never comprehend it, it's not about branding
It's about standing up and demanding respect
And I'm still the realest nigga on the planet
Which rapper wanna check me?
No tweeting, I'm talkin' bout directly
And we beefin' if a nigga disrespect me
You eatin' 'til you chokin' on your food, nigga, bet me
I raised the stakes
That's prime beef, nigga
These rappers fake, but don't mind me, nigga
I been around, come find me, nigga
I'm just tryna be quicker, tryna be wiser
Tryna be richer

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I made improvements, I bleed the music, I be the truest
Wish I coulda signed to EZ
Man, a nigga so ruthless
The truth is me, I could show you what the scoop is
That's [?], this my new shit
Debut this for the students
Other blueprints, get cake 'til it's too rich
Treat this track like a bad habit, gotta lose it
Screamin' "Oh, let's do it"
Don't refuse it with the music
My Mexican partner say home's improvement
I'm Tim Allen, smilin' on islands
Cali to Maui, Bermuda, we wildin'
My homies get foulin'
Nigga's be hatin' on him, I'm travelin'
Motherfuckin' monster, certified savage

[Hook]

[Outro]
Guess again, my nigga
Guess again, my nigga
There's a lot of shit, man that I, I realized in life
You can't believe everything that come out a nigga mouth, man
I can't ask a nigga for shit, man
I ain't ask to come in this motherfuckin' world
You dig what I'm sayin, nigga?
A man know his purpose, nigga
The day he was born was the day he know what the fuck he is and do
[?] nigga, Waka Flocka Flame, man
36, brick house, brick squad monopoly, man
I know I'm a rocket man, big homie fly, man
The role models to these rappers, man
Ha, if I ain't the realest nigga, I'm one of them
