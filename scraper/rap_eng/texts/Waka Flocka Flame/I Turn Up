[Hook] (Joiam-Waka Flocka Flame on Hook)

I turn up like waka flocka
(bow bow bow)
I turn up like waka flocka
(bow bow bow)
I turn up like waka flocka
(bow bow bow)
I turn up like waka flocka
(bow bow bow)

JoI'am [Verse 1]
I should start a drop it drop it game b****
All across the world they know what my muthafu**** name is ((Jojo)
They know what my muthafu**** name is
Every city every country every party they gone bang this waka flocka
Flocka flocka flocka flocka
(bow bow bow bow)
A whole bunch of bitch** we popping bottles
(bow bow bow bow)
100 missiles like chabacka
(bow bow bow bow)
And the party don't start until we pop up
We show up and do what we want
Show up and get what we want
VIP, Bottles at our seed, and the weed smelling straight like cologne
They told me to drink it all straight
And then to go hop on a stage
I told them hold up wait
We bout to go up in this place
Ahhhhhhhhhh

JoI'am [Verse 2]
I got a bad chick to my left
Bad chick to my right
Got a bad in the daytime
A bad chick at night
Got a bad chick in my sight
Light to tell me what she like
She want a 1 night stand, so I'm go gone and give her this pipe cause
I turn up like wake flocka
So don't try to stop when I turn up like waka flocka
We bringing the party when i turn up like waka flocka
We drinking Bacardi when i turn up like waka flocka
Cause I'm on bit** in my zone bit**
Like damn a nig*a too waste
And it got overrated when i got full naked
And she gave me head twice call it toothfacested
Told her that i turn up like flocka, i don't do basic
