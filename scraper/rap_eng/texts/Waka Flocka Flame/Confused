[Hook]
Bouncers act like workers, workers act like bouncers
Hoes act like bitches, and these bitches act like women
Boy they all confused
Most rappers act like drug dealers but never caught a plug
Or never sold dope
Boy they all confused
Snitches act like gangsters, gangsters out here snitchin' spending rich but he really penny pinching
I said they all confused, they all confused, they all confused
I said they all confused, they all confused, they all confused

[Verse]
No point to prove, I'm just me , I don't chill, making history
I feel like Malcom X fresh from Mecca I got enemies
Flockaveli, finger fuck this industry; my money
All you middle eastern holy [?] enemy
The words I spit is biblical
I just reached my pinnacle my feeling now invincible
I'm the principle
Million dollar business move these rap niggas looking pitiful
They all confused
A rotten [?] don't notice you
Eat a rapper cannibal
Grew up round them in the [?]
You turn around they stabbin' you
I said it once I say it twice they all confused
Check them [?] crew
Companies won't sponsor you plus now your label dropping you, fool

[Hook]
