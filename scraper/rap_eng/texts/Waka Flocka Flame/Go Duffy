[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Live with the Glock, kill with the Glock
Rob with the Glock, chill with the Glock
Finger-fuck my Glock, they gon’ say a nigga duffy
Ride like a Huffy, wrap your head like a mummy
Don’t play with my money, dollar or my moolah
Wrist same color as Mami Chula
Stupid-ass jeweler, green-ass diamonds
Traffic light shining, Waka keep grinding
Gucci Mane signed him, now that boy duffy
Dropped six mixtapes, now my boys going duffy
Trunk going duffy, trap going duffy
Disrespect Waka, I ain’t kill you? Then you lucky

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Can you picture a little nigga like me, straight thugging?
Hotter than some fire, shawty, like something in the oven
The G-code, we live by it everyday
Bitch nigga get out of line, bitch nigga get erased
That my homeboy's Turk verse, put a nigga in a hearse
Evil thoughts got the people thinking that my mind cursed
They say I can’t rap, they say I didn’t trap
They say I’m always flexing, I don’t run with a strap
But I go duffy, riding on sixes
Stunting on these niggas and dicking down they bitches
Pockets on Buffy, extra fucking fat
Drugged up, bunking, calm down, lab rat

[Hook: Turk]

[Verse 3: Emani the Made Woman]
Shit, now I'm here now, the star up in the game
Emani the Made Woman, nigga, Waka Flocka Flame
When I touch shit, it catch fire
I'm a made bitch, so I don't cry
Get money all 365
Got 26's on all my rides
My diamonds like fireworks
You can touch them, bitch, but you're getting hurt
Don't be fooled by the skirt
I'll put your ass on Life Alert
In the club stunting, man
Be checking out my fucking frame
Balling on my fucking name
I'm looking for his fucking chain
Getting money, that's all I know
Hit the club, putting on a show
Get wrong, I'm locking all the doors
And I'm looking better than all the hoes
And see me, nigga, like Turk say
Since my very first birthday
I want it in the worst way
Play with my money, a nigga getting sprayed
