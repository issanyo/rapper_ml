[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
No matter how far I go (I go)
No matter how hard I try (I try)
It's like I'm livin' in rewind
I'm runnin' in circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Runnin' in circles

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Flocka!
It's 2016, feel like 2010
I'm in the same spot with a bigger bank (true)
I ain't goin' nowhere that my niggas ain't (squad)
Made a way so my niggas ate (squad)
Took my best friend away (Flocka)
Lately I've been feelin' some kinda way (you know)
But I needed help, they turned away
You got the nerve to say I ain't gonna make it
Shit, I ain't ever fake it (Flocka)
I earned my spot, I ain't have to take it (Flocka)
All I know is grind, all I know is hustle
Got tired of waitin', fuck patience
Same bullshit, same niggas (what)
Stayed the same, won't change, nigga
Fuck diamonds and chains, nigga
My campaign still champagne, nigga (squad)

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
No matter how far I go (I go)
No matter how hard I try (I try)
It's like I'm livin' in rewind
I'm runnin' in circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Runnin' in circles

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got my own producers, made my own sound
Just go hard, never back down
Hear the echos, that's haters all in my background (shawty)
Fuck y'all (Flocka!)
Yeah all of y'all, don't notice you (I mean)
Y'all sellin' lies, y'all tellin' lies
I know the truth
You can feel the pain in my vocal booth (you know)
I ain't gonna stop 'til I'm platinum times two
Lord, if they only knew
All this bullshit I've been through (squad)
I done seen and did some things you can't do
You can't walk a mile in my Mike J's (yeah)
Where I come from, yeah you gotta keep a J (squad)
Just to pay a bill, make a way
Stay above water, thank you for the corners
Squad! Flocka

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
No matter how far I go (I go)
No matter how hard I try (I try)
It's like I'm livin' in rewind
I'm runnin' in circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Runnin' in circles

[Bridge: Derez De'Shon]
Feel like I've been here before (I've been here before)
I done seen it all, done it all
Some shit changed (some shit changed)
But I still managed to stay the same (I did)
Through all the rain (through all the rain)
Through all the pain (through all the pain)
It's like I'm runnin' in circles

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
No matter how far I go (I go)
No matter how hard I try (I try)
It's like I'm livin' in rewind
I'm runnin' in circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
Circles (yeah)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' myself (self)
Lappin' my (lappin' my)
I'm lappin' myself (self)
Runnin' in circles
