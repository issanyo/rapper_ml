[Hook: Play Boy Nick]
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Trapping since yay-high, yes, Flocka stay fly
Waka Flocka Flame stay rolling off the bangs
Off-yellow dope, call that shit off-base
12 kicked my door, that's another fucking case
Erase your whole face if you think 'bout robbing me
Long, black dreads like my name was Bob Marley
So many tats, you would think I ride a Harley
Big Glock 40 if he try to harm me
Don't need my big gun 'cause that ain't no army
So many stacks, why the fuck you think it's storming?
So Icey wet show, boy, let your check go
Southside Riverdale, folk, where I lay my head, folk
Flocka!

[Hook: Play Boy Nick]
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)

[Verse 2: Slicmook]
All right, I whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, down to get another one
Gon' holler at my folks, gon' tell them we gon' need a hundred of them
My hustle game phenomenal, you can can ask a hundred of them
My swagger like atomic bomb, blowing up the dumb and dumb
Stupid acting, bet I [?] some [?] with atomic guns
I'm out here, 'bout to buy me one, these niggas don't know I'm foolish, huh?
Especially on that cupid, huh? You feeling mighty stupid, huh?
Why are you with that burner? Bet I'll beam you up to Jupiter

[Verse 3: Play Boy Nick]
I'm selling blow from nine to five, so you can call it my blowjob
My dope is like my beat 'cause when it hit the street, it's straight drop
Flava Flav wear the clock, but I be on the clock
My stacks the same color and size as a cobra

[Hook: Play Boy Nick]
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)
Bands in my pockets, bands on my tires
Sharp-creased jeans, sharper than some barbed wires
Bricks on the block, pills on the corner
Marijuana coming in, straight from Arizona (stupid!)

[Verse 4: Wooh da Kid]
You can come try, you can come test
But this Glock right here leaves a big mess
So Icey Boys, we're swagging through your whole team
Like Malcolm X, I'm getting bands by any means
I got marching bands, in my pocket
I think it's a battle, tell the drummer to stop it
Don't need a plug, my CEO got bricks
If my bands running low, I'm coming for your shit
