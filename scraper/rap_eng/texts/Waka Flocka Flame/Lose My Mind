[Intro]
Hey man, fuck wrong with these niggas check? Fuck y'all niggas thought nigga? We ain't pullin' up on y'all niggas man

[Hook 1]
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
All dese bitches snortin' lines
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
White bitches snortin' lines
Hunned bands for my time
Quarter mil on the line
Quarter mil for my time
Everywhere like Wi-Fi
Don't go nowhere without my .5
We can shoot it out or fight
Those my brothers, better not touch 'em
If you do, I might bust 'em
For that sack, I might rush 'em
Know that pink ain't robotussin
Drink muddy, yeah it's dirty
White hoes snortin' and fuckin'
Blunt to the face, headbuttin'
Colorado, Denver Nugget

[Verse 1]
You got that work, we extortion nigga
Put the bud in the hood and endorse my niggas
I'm from Riverdale I was a magician
I get 'em gone soon as they get in
Never had a role model just me and my niggas
Extendo's on the pistol
I remember havin' four dollas
And everybody starvin'
Had to split McChickens
Young nigga rich, go run to McDonald's
I'm servin' McChickens
Rollie my wrist
Red bottoms my bitches
Black body my Bentley
No suit and tie, handle my business
And the same niggas still with me
In the same hood, on the same block
With the same niggas in the trenches

[Hook 2]
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
All dese bitches snortin' lines
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
White bitches snortin' lines
Hunned bands for my time
Quarter mil on the line
Quarter mil for my time
Coolin' with my slimes
I'ma lose my fuckin' mind
I wish I could press rewind
Sixty thousand on my time
Rollie on my wrist gon' shine
Stare too long, you might go blind

[Verse 2]
Every seen a real nigga on the Forbes list haan?
Back to back Porsches on my horse shit
Ever count a hundred thousand dollars like "Oh shit"
Ashy white bricks, know I hit it with the lotion
I swear I really came from nothin' nigga
Clayton County I was thuggin' nigga
Got my name, I was bussin' niggas
It's defensive shots it ain't nothing nigga
Broad day out in public nigga
You ain't day one I ain't fuckin' with ya
You a sweet lick, you a sucker nigga
See me out in traffic tryna duck a nigga
I go Slim Dunkin on these niggas
Love every one of my niggas
Fuck with 'em I swear I be gunnin' at niggas
Ain't worried bout none of you niggas, I swear

[Hook]
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
All dese bitches snortin' lines
I'ma lose my fucking mind
If you touch one of mine
White bitches snortin' lines
Hunned bands for my time
Quarter mil on the line
Quarter mil for my time
