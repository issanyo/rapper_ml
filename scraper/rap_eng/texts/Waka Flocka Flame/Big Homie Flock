[Verse 1]
The trap hot, it’s on fire
Eat a rap nigga like a Busy Bee plate
I run my hood, no marathon
Took off for a minute now I’m back on
That base bigger, my dreads longer
My niggas realer, my weed stronger
Smoking gas packs, that body builder
Money talks, I don’t fucking hear you

[Verse 2]
You can’t dress, you ain’t got swag
You a walking label, you a signed artist
Got my own label, fuck these niggas
With the middle fingers, I’ma die rich
I'm a gangbanger, so it’s fuck the prison
What critics say
I ain’t talking money, I keep 1 K
Don't make me transform to my old ways
Keep black doors on me like OJ
I’m turnt up off no drugs
You turned down, you getting no love
Love the energy so I’m in the crowd, acting wild
They know I go hard, bitch I’m Debbie's child
One phone call, send them killers at you
That's speed dial
I was facing 10 years at the same time Joey beat his murder trial
R.I.P. to Cal, that’s a fallen soldier
Still collecting pennies, I’m a humble nigga
Never join forces, make my own way
I keep cake, no birthday
Fuck a off day, competition, I eliminate
Follow street laws, don’t litigate
I delegate, you follow
I’m on my own shit, you borrow
Last nigga tried to rob me got shot, now he suing me for a half a mill
That’s real shit
