[Hook: B. Smeezee]
Okay, the trap on smash, boy, we getting cash
Speed Racer kush pack, I get it off fast
Boy, I'm on the block, nigga, come shop
My conversation money, I be talking gwap
I be talking gwap, I be talking gwap
I be talking gwap, I be talking gwap
I be talking gwap, I be talking gwap
I be talking gwap, I be talking gwap

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Eat the gwap, chew the gwap
Digest the gwap, fuck with gwap
Sleep with gwap, me and my gwap
Man, I only talk about gwap
I be off that ecstasy
So please, homeboy, don't fuck with me
S.S.M., yup!
H.S.T., buck!
Running through these dummy bricks, got this young nigga stupid rich
Green diamonds, spending shit, I bought it for the hell of it
Kush pack loud, come and buy it, you can smell thw shit
28's so fucking high, I'm sitting on them elephants
I'm talking to my plug, yes, I'm backdoor trapping
Smeezee hold the trap and Lil Capp selling yoppers
Flocka selling mid by the motherfucking pound
I don't want that shit, you can have that Bobby Brown

[Verse 2: Lil Capp]
Purple purple kush pack, kitchen burning kush back
Trying to find me, loud smelling, where they look at?
'Cause I be where them crooks at, damn, he in the trap
I got it for the low, so if you want it, ask for Capp

You know I keep that loud, as of now, we cooking pies
The block showed me love, Flocka got the plug
Smeezee off the heezy, got them bouncing in the club
Hoes give me hugs, but them niggas looking funny
You can't talk to me if you ain't talking money
'Cause I be talking gwap, I be talking gwap
I'm the man on the block and I got that bitch on lock

Okay, the trap on smash, chopper on blast
Smeezee is a hustler, my pockets on cash
I'm talking to my money, so I listen to what my Glock say
Benjamins and Franklins, I fuck with them the long way
Boy, I got bread, a thousand-dollar cashing

You ain't talking money, you ain't talking shit

Triple steak shawty, I'm a fucking field mopper
