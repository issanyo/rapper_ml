[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm liqoured up, im drunk as fuck
I'm pulling over, ive had enough
I'm feeling her, she's feeling me
I'm Livin life like a movie

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka stop!, shorty freeze
Take a picture, say cheese
Eastside, westside, southside, northside landslide
Lets get it poppin, lets go to work
Every weekend in the club smoking big purp
Now its sunday, they yelling out boy "go to church"
I'm so tired I'm like damn it I can't go to church
It's Waka Flocka last name Flame
I do my thang, when you see me man
Blood here, blood there
This our thug music, thats how fucked he is

[Hook x8]
I'm just livin life
Shawty im just livin life

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
It's 12 o'clock now it's show time
OG gucci said flocka boy get on yo grind
I stopped trapping, now I'm rapping so its time to shine
I keep sweating now I'm busy ho I'm finna die
Ho's they finna grind, cos they want my number
Vacations for the summer, my first ride in the hummer
I know I had to make it, keep it real and never fake it
Bricksquad clique so stop all that player hating

[Hook x8]
I'm just livin life
Shawty I'm just livin life

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Eat the guap, chew the guap, digest the guap
Run up in your house with a masking Glock
Disrespect the clique you gon die this year
Gucci man, the player aka the polar bear
