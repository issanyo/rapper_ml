Extenders on block when i squeeze the grip

Doin income tax scams, gettin accident money
Always count it twice, make sure its accurate money
Never get to comfortable and relax with the money
Niggas will run up on you with them gats for the money
Blow your fuckin brains out after they ask for the money
Spend it all on a bitch, then its a wrap for the money
