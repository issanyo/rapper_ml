[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I fucked my money up, now I can't re-up
Ran up in his spot just to get my stacks up
Now I'm back on deck, so shawty, what the fuck you want?
Heard he's talking shit, but this ain't what the fuck you want
Locked my CEO up, now it's back to coca
Niggas talking shit, bro, hang him by a ropa
Hit em with the chopper, call that shit hot llama
Call me Waka Flocka AKA Young Wild Nigga
AKA Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft
Stacks on the floor, watch Kebo water whipping
Shoots it to the left, then he shoots it to the right
So Icey Brick Boys got it all night
These lame-ass niggas ain't got no fight
Kick in my door, we gonna shoot it out all night
Home of the Braves, shawty, shoot 'em with AK

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
One shot, man down, his brains go "ka-pow!"
Ow, that shit hurt, so don't fuck around
But that happen often off in Riverdale, Georgia
You gonna pay the life you live off in Riverdale, Georgia
They gonna lay your ass out, rock you to sleep like a baby
Hit Squad, shawty, in the hood, we got them babies
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence
