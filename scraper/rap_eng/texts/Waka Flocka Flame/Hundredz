[Pre-Chorus:]
We hittin the club and none of ya’ll niggas is fuckin invited
The ladies is there, their bodies is crazy and oh, they excited
They callin and textin and talkin bout how they just want it in private
I'm tryna stay focus while she give me head while a nigga is drivin

[Chorus:]
She gon get nasty for hundredz and hundredz and hundredz and hundredz [x4]

[Verse 1:]
She gon get nasty for hundredz and hundredz and hundredz and hundredz
Show me you want it, you want it, you want it, you want it
I'm having a stake, the stake, uncame the roof
Now how bout the play, now hop in the Coupe
[?] and twitter and tens green, the hundredz are blue
20 and 1s, the ten is familiar, the ten is for you
I'm so excited, these bitches is hidin
I'm blowin the money, just throwin the light in

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Real niggas around me, if you ain't get wid us then you not invited
For hundredz and hundredz and hundredz and hundredz
They know to get nasty like Biggie and Roxy
Benjamin Franklin all ova her body
Might just spend another, buy hunid new Mazi
These are for moonrocks and molly
Why don't you try me, ya’ll niggas ain't touchin nobody
My new ones go on mee, that new bitch like an outtie
Shouty my wollie, I'm blowin on Cali
Don't pass me no valley, I'm drinkin Armani
I'm rich as a bitch so you know she gon fuck me
Ten bitch in the club on two different drugs
She fuck with the hood, she throwin on blunts
They lovin a thug, I came from the mud
I keep it 100, you know what's up
Flocka

[Pre-Chorus]
