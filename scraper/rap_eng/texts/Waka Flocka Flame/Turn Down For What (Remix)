[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame] (Lil Jon)
(Turn down for what?)
Im the turn up god
(Turn down for what?)
We the turn up squad
(Turn down for what?)
Turn up! Turn up! Turn up!

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame] (Lil Jon)
(Turn down for what?)
Im the turn up god
(Turn down for what?)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame] (Lil Jon)
(Turn down for what?)
All you mad girls down to fuck
I got your Angie wet, thats holy water
You can't outdrink Flocka, you dont know me, Pablo
Im a round switch laner, you a one way hater
And my shorty thick like a Sunday paper
A fool for the young thugs and they all smiling
Kush got me pulling like ice cream and soda
Throwing money, call the club a ballroom
Come on, dude, make this motherfucker a monsoon
Never went to college but I party on campus
Hit me on stage while Im setting full of antlers
Bitches in the presidential join the campaign
Ain't nothing turning down

[Hook]

[Outro: Waka Flocka Flame] (Lil Jon)
(Turn down for what?)
Im the turn up god
(Turn down for what?)
We the turn up squad
(Turn down for what?)
(Turn down for what?)
