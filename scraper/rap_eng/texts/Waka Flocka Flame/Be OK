[Hook]
We been at the top, since the other day
Homie I know you see us, just look the other way
And I can tell you’re jealous, feeling some type of way
But it’s gone be ok
I got my people with me, and you know they don’t play
My homie just came home just the other day
You know I’m feeling good, feeling some type of way
But it’s gone be ok

[Verse 1: T-Wayne]
Mama always told me I would be the greatest
And I could tell them other niggas hated
Half man, half amazing
Just don’t kiss your girl cause you gone taste it
I was all in my room, I was all in that womb
I was all in that foreign, swerved on em like vroom
Quick to pull up on you, you know my people don’t play
Come knocking at your door if they figure where you stay
You know I got my people with me
Of course they got my back, these niggas tryna get me
You know that they gone always hate, but it’s gone be OK
Cause you know them boys I’m with gone let it spray

You know I’m feeling good, feeling some type of way

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
It’s gone be OK, hit em with the K
They know we don’t play, with other people’s children
Fuck around and make my dogs run down this building
I’m up, I could give a fuck about your feelings
Us against the world, stack this money to the ceiling
Dime bags and elbows, you can’t fuck with me when my eyes closed
Don’t pop shit, just gun tote
I ain’t going broke, what the fuck you mean
Molly water, don’t fuck with lean
Nigga that ain’t freckles, those red beams
Used to pop beans with [?], now it’s condos and palm trees
From Elm Street to Riverdale, I’ma give em hell
I’m shipping gas bags through the mail
You a pussy nigga, you scared of jail

[Verse 3: Bo Deal]
I let my mama know that it’s gone be ok
I went to jail, came home, now a nigga straight
I seen my ex bitch, just the other day
And looked the other way
I done came up, now I got a little fame bruh
And I got my little change up, I’m still real, I ain’t change up
My money long, my team good
I’m in the burbs but I’m still hood
I rep my city, it feel good
For the haters I still do it
Now show me love ho, clap for me
I helped put my city on the map shorty
And you cannot deny that fact shorty
Tried to play me yankee, hit em with that MAC shorty
