[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Turnt up
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
All I wanna do is party
My head keep on spinning around
Baby girl why don’t you first, dr-dr-dr-drop it to the ground
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
I be divin' in the crowd
Shake my dreads, actin' wild
Can't do lean, too blowed out
Too turnt up, I can't turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
Can’t turn down
