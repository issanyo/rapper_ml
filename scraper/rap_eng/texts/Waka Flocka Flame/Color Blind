[Hook]
I'm color blind when it come to money
I'm color blind when it come to money
I'm gonna eat with every gang
I'm gonna eat with everybody, man

[Verse 1]
She color blind she just want my money
Hoes grind you can't get my money
Bitch you lying you just want my money
And I'm going to stay real to my gang
The police hating 'cus I got this money (fuck 'em)
I'm in the trap trying to stack this money
I'm all on stage rapping for this money
I'm color blind, you already know
I'm color blind, girl drop it low
I'm color blind for the money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm still color blind, I'm chasing dough
Chase this dough, man, chase this dough
All I know is grind hard times
But now I got this money pussy watch me shine
I'm color blind all I know is money
It's all business when it comes to money
Girls give me kisses every time I throw this money
Word around town I went triple Plat
All onstage, ten thousand yelling "braaat"
I'mma stay hood to the game
I'mma stay hood to the game
