See, my friends showed me so much
Good or bad, they all I had
Reminisce on the past
And the to the ones that passed lift the glass
See my friends, DOWN
All for one, one for all, we gon swang
If you ballin', do yo thang
Tell a hater kiss your ass
Where yall was when we was eating dolla menus?
So close to a homeless man pickin' trash
See my friends, they was all I had
They showed me so much unconditional love shorty real
Shit I'm mentally home alone, so I'm kickin' down does
Lying niggas on flos'
See my friend they all I had, showed me so much good or bad
You don't like how we live, nigga kiss our ass

If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up
If you if you if you ballin' then put yo cup up
If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back
If you if you if you ballin' throw your top back

They wanna see me dead and locked up
They wanna see me dead and locked up
If you ballin' if you if you if you ballin'
Put your cup up, why they wanna see me locked up?
