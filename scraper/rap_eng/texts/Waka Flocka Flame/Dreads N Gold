It's Flock, bitch
Catch me on your block, bitch

Flame

[Chorus]
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south

Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south

Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south
Shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth

[Verse 1]
Them big ass 28's same color as a Pepsi can
If he try Waka Flocka, bet his pussy ass die
Put them goons on your mama, put them goons on your grandmama
Goons on your girl and brother (nigga, this shit deep)
Put your ass six feet deep, get your mind off that fuck shit
Hoes, fours and clothes is all a young nigga want
I'ma lose my fucking lungs if I keep on smoking blunts
Yes I do gangbang, su woo to the B gang
Free my nigga, Gucci Mane, I can't really see, mane
Rolling up them B's, mane, look at Flocka fucking chain
I don't really drank that lame, Riverdale boys, we do our thing
With that Mary-fucking-Jane and that coke skirt cane
Go, go, go, mane, 12 at my front and my back door
Go get my Mac, folk, I ain't going out like that
It's about a hundred years, then enlarge your [?]
Trying to run up in my house, we gon' have to shoot it out

[Chorus]
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south
Shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south
Shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth

[Verse 2]
Lightskin, lightskin, hell yeah, I dig that
Big tits, big tits, hell yeah, I love that
Little ass, nice legs, little waist and cute face

So Icey Boys keep bad bitches, shawty know what we about
Baby, hold my pistol, put this clip up in your fucking mouth
Now she high as hell off in the room, my dick off in her mouth
Run up in your husband's house, that's the way we do down south

[Chorus]
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south
Shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Dreads and golds, I'm from down south
Down south, down south
Shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth
Shawty, shawty from down south with them golds in his mouth

[Outro]

Free Gucci, nigga
