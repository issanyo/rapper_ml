Dirty Birds in this motherfucker, it's Gucci
Matter of fact it's Big Gucci in this motherfucker
Flockaveli, Birdman
Cash Money, Brick Squad linked up to 17

In the streets make some moves, get my paper
This is what I do
Fuck 'em, blow croak smoke on my haters
This is what I do

Pop up with the real fuck you fakers
This is what I do
All about my money, fuck you, pay me

It's Big Gucci, mob moves you, wise fools
You can't mute me, my whole life I'm ProTools
First day appeal, just elude me or shoot me
I stand on my word, I'm like Luke in the '90s

Cocaine crazy, 1980, baby
2/12 they birthed me, now find me in Miami
East Atlanta with me, always to the Grammys
This time? Big bucks, no Whammies

My trunk slammin', my track jammin'
I'm too fancy, manners, I left 'em
I'm healthy, stealthy and wealthy, you try me?
I'll probably show a nigga how to drive a jet ski

Them Brick Squad niggas got me like I got me
Me, Flock and Baby back to Bankhead in real Bugatis
Brick Squad, Zone 6, Cash Money, what up?
I might just fuckin' buy my mom a Maserati

I got 6's on my red and black whip, this is what I do
Watch them girls choose, iced up like a fool
Po'n lean in my styrofoam, this is how I screw

Flexin' with the crew, mean muggin', who?
Bad attitude, what you wanna do?
20 bottles, 40 blunts, meet me on the moon
Make it, make it rain
Now my lil' bitch strippers come together, fame

Let my pants hang, watch me do my chain swang
Takin' bitches Mane with this yellow diamond karat chain
Waka, Flocka, Flame, Gucci, Gucci Mane
With the Birdman, this is how we hang

Man, I come through Chevrolet but it look gray Coupe
Get my money, stack it up, this is what real players do
Now if he don't get no money then that nigga need to shoot

Smokin' kush at the house while yo' bitch clean my shoe
Real gangsta nigga, mayne, this is what I do
Say lil' partner, just hit me sayin', "Man, I need a deuce"
So I hit him with the force, this is what I do

Killed yo' baby momma, this is what I do
Work chipped cell phones, this is what I do
Rims on my car look like man, they runnin' out they shoe
With that blue 20 piece look like my backyard swimmin' pool
