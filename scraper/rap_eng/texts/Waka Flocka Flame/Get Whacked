[Intro: Blac Youngsta]
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back
Whacked, whacked, whacked, whacked, whacked
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie...

Fuck nigga
Lil' nigga, lil' nigga
Lil' bitch, lil' bitch

[Hook: Blac Youngsta: & Waka Flocka]
Fuck with me, you get whacked
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the shoulder strap
Where these pussy niggas at?
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the [?] strap
Where these pussy niggas at?

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta & Waka Flocka]
Rappers kill me with their war stories
Shot once, that's way glory
Four rings on me like Robert Horry
Never by myself cause the pistol on me
Hear these niggas talkin', come and take it from me
Get your brother whacked for a quarter birdie
Let 'em gun sound, let 'em gun sound
They turned down, got no buds
We're poured up, we're on drugs
I advice y'all not to fuck with us
We shoot first, ask questions later
Pull up on 'em like, what's happenin'
Poppin' boys in the hood, I'm the big homie
Death row Suge, man, these niggas know us
They cross the line, nigga

[Hook: Blac Youngsta: & Waka Flocka]
Fuck with me, you get whacked
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the shoulder strap
Where these pussy niggas at?
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the shoulder strap
Where these pussy niggas at?

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Regular nigga, baby mama, auntie, sister and grandmama
I'ma load them young niggas up right now [?]
Fuck nigga disrespectin' me, so I pulled the gun on him
All my lil' niggas with it, they been killin' all Summer
Brrrll, brrrll, brrrll, brrrll
I'm a big blood, that's a fact
Now [?] three, bebop, bitch a blood
That's the set that I rep
On the set, told my mama I wanna trap
Told my mama I wanna rap
I keep that strap, and
Any nigga run up on me, they get whacked
I'm a CMG nigga

[Hook: Blac Youngsta: & Waka Flocka]
Fuck with me, you get whacked
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the shoulder strap
Where these pussy niggas at?
Robbed, killed or kidnapped
Everybody runnin' with straps, that's a fact
Know my niggas got my back, they protect me with the Mac
Your big homie he a rat
Niggas ridin', screamin', "blrrr, blrrr, blrrr, blrrr"
Choppa with the shoulder strap
Where these pussy niggas at?
