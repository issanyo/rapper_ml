[Verse 1: Yung Bezo]
I said I wake up in the morning, grabbed the Desert with the beam
I brushed my teeth and walked downstairs and grabbed two cups of lean
My girl looking good, so I smacked her on the butt
Turned around and tied my shoe up, caught her sipping in my cup
She said, "That's what you drinking?" I say, "It's looking muddy"
I say, "Bitch, it's that Texas tea, you know my Sprite dirty"
And when I get home, she got two cups filled up for me
And then I kiss her on the cheek, then it's right back to the money

[Chorus: Yung Bezo]
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
I'm 'bout to activate this Actavis, double up the 'methazine
Hollywood Dunk, nigga, I be fucking actresses
Drop a four in the twenty, six in the liter
Kushball bats, I think I'm Derek Jeter
Keep a pint of that La-Z-Boy recliner
Syrup in my cup, I ain't talking Aunt Jemima
Transformers juice, sipping Barney apple cider
Your wifey let me sign her, autographed vagina
Drank a whole zip, unzip me
I'm 'bout to overdose, what up, Pimp C?
Double up the muddy to the tippy
I like my Sprite dirty (what you mean?)
Filthy

[Chorus: Yung Bezo]
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
Half a pint of lean, nigga, in my two liter
MyTouch T-Mobile and my black beeper
Bitches hit me up at night, I'm like the Jeeper Creeper
Red and white sneakers, I call them dopemans
Ninja Turtles high, boy, I'm on that Donatello
In some crushed ice, I rock big ice
Pink left and right, it's 'bout 60 grand
Call them two-step diamonds, they be dancing, man
I give four fucks, I need four cups
Drink this fucking lean 'til I throw up
Man, my stomach hurt, Slim, call a doctor
Fucking with the Dirt Gang, I might grab a chopper

[Chorus: Yung Bezo]
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up
I got two cups, doubled up
Four swishers, nigga, roll them up
If you don't like me, I could give two fucks
I'm sipping straight lean, double up

[Verse 4: Dame Luchiano]
I wake up, bake up, tell my bitch to hook a steak up, roll that shake up
Know I make her just to break her, fill my tank up, hit the bank up
Grab some Swishers, pour that drink up, me and Bezo barely legal
Shopping needles, rolling reefer in that Libra, still got two cups
Shit, last night, 'bout two Sprites
'Bout four zips, I just slow sip
Diamonds dancing like Kris Kross
I get my cup, I get my Sprite, and then I top it off
My pack of Swishers right beside the pack of styrofoam
Baby bottle on the counter, by the telephone
Stank smell strong, I'm on that loud shit
Crushed ice, I'm finna activate this Actavis
Drop a three inside the twenty, call it MJ
I drop a four inside the twenty, then it's [?]
Rich dreadhead nigga, no hair cuts
Bitch, bring me two cups, make sure they doubled up
