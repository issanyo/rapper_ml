[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Um, yeah, what?
If you love life like I love life, say "hell yeah"
I ain't hear you, man (what?)

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your hands up if you came to ball
We drinking white Remy 'til we motherfucking fall
Put your hands up if you love life
We buy bottles by the 20, we don't want no Bud Ice
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
My phone hot, them folks on my landline
Dropped 64 bands just to tell time
You a used-to-be, shawty, I'm what's popping now, get used to me
Pussy, you are history
So I called Wooh and Dunk
These rappers' singles sound like Flocka, crowd like, "Uh huh, yeah"
Shitting on my peers
Headlight diamonds in my ear, I fuck them by the pair, I swear
What I'm driving don't come out 'til next year
I'm in the two-seater, ice, tats and wife beaters, yeah
Old ass rappers need to retire
"30's the new 20", you a motherfucking liar
Call me Sire Waka Flocka Flame
Nigga tried to kill me, but his ese have no aim
I'm what's popping now, shawty, you a used-to-be
All I know is grind, you can call me Pusha T

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your hands up if you came to ball
We drinking white Remy 'til we motherfucking fall
Put your hands up if you love life
We buy bottles by the 20, we don't want no Bud Ice
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it

[Verse 2: Slim Dunkin]
Okay, three three-pieces and two orange juices
Riding in that Big Worm, sitting on deuces
Ice cream man selling popsicles and looseys
New jack in the city, where the fuck is Pookie?
Back to the basics, strip a nigga naked
Kick a nigga's door, find the work in the basement
Scaring niggas straight to the place where Ma$e went
Exterminate the witness, judge asking where the case went
You don't want no parts of me, my squad grand larceny
Bucking on your goons, brought the Million Man March with me
FN in the holster, kush in the coaster
Barry Stevens jello, keep everything kosher

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your hands up if you came to ball
We drinking white Remy 'til we motherfucking fall
Put your hands up if you love life
We buy bottles by the 20, we don't want no Bud Ice
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it

[Verse 3: Wooh da Kid]
I'm living good, I'm drinking good, I'm smoking great
He's looking bad, his pockets slim, they losing weight
Closed casket every verse, his career's a wake
He run with them Kit Kat boys, give that boy a break
I'm what's popping now, they don't wanna hear you
If my life was in your hands, I still wouldn't feel you
BSM gorillas, we are not tamed
Mind filled with thoughts, heart filled with pain
I'm what's popping now, I'ma chop him down
MJ bullets hit him, make him spin around
Wooh da King is a hazard, keep your hands off
Diamonds shining so bright, call me black boss

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your hands up if you came to ball
We drinking white Remy 'til we motherfucking fall
Put your hands up if you love life
We buy bottles by the 20, we don't want no Bud Ice
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
What's popping? Baby, let me see you do it
