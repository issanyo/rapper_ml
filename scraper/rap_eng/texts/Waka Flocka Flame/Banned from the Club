[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Can't follow no nigga, I ain't never meet my pops
Red dots all on him, he'll think he had the chicken pox
Beef, I nicknamed it Chaz
Put little bruh on you, then you know that's your ass
Closed caskets, you little dumb motherfucker
Flexing ice, throwing bands, catch me at the Rucker
Money talks, nigga, call me Chris Tucker
Run up on me, then you a dead motherfucker
You know my company, Brick Squad Monopoly
They love our fucking swag, why these pussies copy me?
All in VIP, I'm trying to smoke about a key
He could say anything, don't put your hands on me
Waka Flocka

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me

[Verse 2: Yung Joey]
Skinny jeans, my rubberbands don't fit
That's your girl? I'll take that bitch
Discussed her head with my dogs
On a scale of one to ten, rate that bitch
Send her back to your ass with a new bag and a new swag
Have her talking back and shit like you dad, now you mad
Sour D, I'm feeling good
Squad on deck, I wish a nigga would
Get your drama like the DJ
Take turns stomping on that ass like a relay
I'm getting head on the freeway
Bad yellow thing bobbing her head like a DJ
This pimping shit is easy
I'm popping, bro, we popular, them bitches do what we say

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me

[Verse 3: Slim Dunkin]
Drinks of the pink, can't think on that stink
Back-to-back swishers, eyes low when I blink
Blowing doja on the dolo, ain't posing for no photo
Keep a bad bitch hunched-back, Quasimodo
Solo in the photo, strapped with a .44
Nigga jump stupid, knock the horse off your polo
Bullets bouncing, pogo, rob me, that's a no go
Nigga, this the squad, Flocka Flame and Lil JoJo
Dunk

[Chorus: Slim Dunkin]
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
We banned from the club, security guards scared
Bands on your head, couple bands, you'd be dead
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me
Bands on bands on bands on me
Grams on grams on grams on me
Strapped up I got that blam on me
Bet nann nigga put they hands on me
