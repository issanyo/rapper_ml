[Intro: Big Stacksss]
What it do, nigga?
It's your boy, Big Stacksss, mane
I'm right here with my nigga Waka, mane
So Icey Entertainment, mane
Meet the Paper Gang, nigga
Let's get it, baby
The best in the streets, nigga
Believe that

[Hook: Big Stacksss]
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Oh let's do it, shawty said he need the bricks
I come masked up and strapped up, so don't flex
I'm thinking to myself, why not sell this nigga flex?
I'm about that check, so bitch, where the money at?
I don't really play 'bout that, where Flock in the trap
Beat it off the tip-top, shoot you like a jumpshot
That's how Waka Flock rock, my trap boom like a beatbox
My bass bump so good, Gucci bump me by the [?]
I popped two beans, now I'm out of here
Hey, like real talk, seen a hundred pounds, man
Dope in my mouth, so you know my tongue numb
I got mid in my nuts, trying to sell this onion

[Hook: Big Stacksss]
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing

[Verse 2: Big Stacksss]
My whole life, I trapped, I'm talking dope house
Fuck niggas racks, I'm talking mighty mouse
Two bricks and a scale at my mama's house
By the stove while she cooking up some sauerkraut
Real niggas in the street, that's who I'm talking to
Fake niggas, go ahead and hate, that's what you're prone to
My whole life in the streets, getting to the money
When I was broke, they was happy, now they looking funny
Big Stacksss, motherfucker, that's a damn shame
So much money in my stash, I changed it to my name
So much knowledge on the streets, I had to stuff my brain
So much sauce on the work, I give it to you wings

[Hook: Big Stacksss]
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing

[Verse 3: Big Stacksss]
I'm aggressive on the lane like a kid's toy
And bringing pain and a lot of heat to you fuckboys
Grinning in your face, you need to press your face
Before I give you a brand new fist to taste
And it got a lot of cocaine residue
And I stomp you with the shit under my tennis shoes
Big Stacksss, the Chatt-town representer
The dope be losing, but nigga, I'm a fucking winner
I'm in the hood, on the streets like a mailbox
My bricks multiplying, call them chicken pox
I write my own shit and speak this shit first-person
I had to close the blinds 'cause these fuck niggas is lurking

[Hook: Big Stacksss]
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing
I'm the king of the trap and I ain't talking rap
Two Tecs in my lap 'cause a nigga stay strapped
My nigga doing fifteen, it's nothing but a thing
When he hit the streets again, we be doing the same thing
