[Intro: Jon Geezy]
I know this nigga ain't...
I know this nigga ain't ego trippin' like THAT
Check this nigga out blood
Oh this nigga ego trippin' for real
Other Guy: Stop bro we got to handle him
Jon Geezy: I'mma show...Imma show him how to ego trip blood

[Hook: Waka Flocka]
AK rounds and 45s
(Wouldn't wanna be ya, nigga)
If I pull it boy
(We wouldn't wanna see ya, nigga)

[Chorus]
We ego trippin' cause I'm poppin'
Red, flag stop signing
1017 want a brother, Yeah they signed 'em
Me and Jon like Dre and Snoop
Put me in a vocal booth
Green diamond chain you can call that shit mountain dew
You a fool don't got a tool
10 O'Clock Fox News
40,000 cash money stuffed in the bedroom

[Hook 2]
We don't wanna be ya
We don't wanna see ya
Waka Flocka, Jon Geezy we will come see ya

[Verse: Jon Geezy]
AK what I'm spray BLAT
KAT-KAT you don't wanna play with that
I'm a body layer, what I'm aiming at?
I'm a hustler ain't no changing that
You a buster ain't no fame in that
The hood is where I'm hanging at
While yall niggas be slanging bags
Me and my niggas tote flaming gats
Waka Flocka will get a check for that
A chest of a t-shirt wet with that
Haters get real upset for that
A G ain't got no regrets for that
Blood gang, better have respect for that
For a nigga break your motherfucking neck for that
YouTube all on the net with that
Get jumped I'mma motherfucking vet with that

[Hook 2]

[Chorus]

Woop, woop, woop, woop
Woop, woop, woop, woop
Woop, woop, woop, woop
Woop, woop, woop, FLOCKA

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Jump out your skin nigga cause I know you scared
On a half of beans and liquor so you know he dead
He ego trippin' so I hit him with the eagle nigga
Triangle shit, got stripes like a Bengal bitch
Clayton County Riverdale them boys straight junkies
Strapped everyday nigga who the fuck you
ABC rappin', (?) trappin'
Lying in your rap, pussy nigga you not snappin'
Love the way they run their mouth
Gun up in they fucking mouth
Killers in your fucking house
Take your work and fuck your wife nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Parlae]
(?) Don't forget about the dog hound
WOOP WOOP, we hunt you down like bloodhounds
Fuck a chopper, I kill with that dillinger
It going be corruption when I point cash killing you
Lemonade chain, yellow ice cubes
And I'm all about the Benjamins, call me Ice Cube
Next Friday, I mean this friday
We gonna catch cold and have a hood on the highway
Talk to them, and I ain't talking rap money
I'm talking trap money, still spending sap money

[Hook]

[Outro]
Parlae: When you, when you caught the mazda?
