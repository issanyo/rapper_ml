[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Its christmas time and it gots a lots a snow
Whole lotta junkies comin bangin at my door
They ain't been no good Js so I let em know
Santa gonna fill they stockings with lots and lots of coal
What you want for christmas today ya lil kid?
Wait, did you say you want a scooter and a guinea pig?
I don't got that but I can sell yo ass a couple bricks
And if yo mama home then she can have a couple dicks
UHHAAH! Go threw the kitchen, eat a couple chips
Im mad as hell because I could not find the onion dip
Oops! It is Santa, hope that nigga wouldn't snitch
Santa whats hanging dog? Nothin but yo fxckin lip
I let that slide because he brought alotta christmas gifts
Mr Potato Head, in the shape of 50 Cent
UHHAAAH!! This shit right here it cost me 50 cent
It look brand new besides the fact that it got 50 dents

Jingle bell, Gucci in jail
Waka laid an egg
We ain't never been back to New York
Since Juice got boo'ed off stage
Aye!

Gucci bell, Gucci smell
Like he didn't bathe
So when ya pass by, and Gucci wave hi
Then juiceman gonna say "Aye!"

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
