Fuck shit, yea I'm on that fuck shit
Get yo head cracked for that watch, chain and bracelet
Fuck shit, yea I'm on that fuck shit
He makin' songs bout me, when I see him he better duck bitch
Fuck shit, yea I'm on that fuck shit
Stomp yo ass out til the DJ hit the lights
If he try me he can pulse his body
Shootin' cold my ivy, hands like I'm Ali

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Gone off a molly once a nigga try me
2 bad bitches call it Rooster in my Rari
My young boys sure they know karate
Fake nigga, not me
In the hood find me, hanging with the real slugs
Trap nigga, come embrace us when you can’t find no rap nigga
I can't rap nigga but I still get paid off rap nigga
Adrian Bruno with them hands, make you tap nigga
Getting money, even eating with the jets nigga
Alright, fuck these niggas, they don’t really wanna take it there
Pistols in the club, my young niggas they ain’t fightin fair
Fuck shit, fuck shit – yea I be on it nigga
Take yo watch chain and ring, yea I condone it nigga

You fuck niggas never seem hot
Them same bitch holds, I’m screaming ah!
The one that I lean, squeezing that car 15
I made an offer on the shots I got
Run a ho here cuz these bullets are hot
Put your pussies in a shit bag, what?! Can you dig that
Imagine a bunch of grownups in Huggies, how you gon fix that?
They’re all gonna laugh at you, they’ll laugh at you
Consequence when you cross that line, I been talkin shit on the low
Blow your mind out, no timeout, you gon put yo head to the floor
