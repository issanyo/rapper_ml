[Intro]
Real nigga music, you ain't real then move it
Waka, Flocka!
Real nigga music, you ain't real then move it
MD, Bricksquad!

[Verse]
Ain't no way in hell I'ma see my mama broke
Ain't no way in hell I'ma see my team fall
Only know one thing: go hard, stunt, then I ball
I ain't gonna stop 'til my mama got it all
Ain't no way in hell I'ma see my grandma broke
Ain't no way in hell I'ma rap and sell coke
Ain't no way in hell I ain't gon' always keep it real
A nigga sell and sold just to get a record deal
Ain't no way in hell I'ma fail with this rappin'
Waka Flocka go hard, that's a real known fact
All these niggas killin', where the fuck the bodies at?
All these drug dealers, where the fuck the buyers at?
This how my mama Debbie wrote it, mom I'm ready
I get stupid cake, you can call me Lil Debbie
Grandma I ain't gon' stop 'til the Lord come and get me
So much pain in me, I use the mic to pour it out
I kidnap drugs just to fly the fuck away
Maybe one day I'ma be in a better place
That's like sayin' a black man ain't gon' catch another case
I've been through so much shit I just wish it could erase
Waka Flocka!
