This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music
This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music, nigga

[Verse 1]
There he was, three drop, thinking this shit hip hop
B.I.G. lyrics, rest in peace 2Pac
Big L music, big hard lyrics
Gucci with a attitude, yes, it's fucking what we do
Nigga with a attitude like my name was Eazy
Go dumb music like my name was Mac Dre
December 1st, call it Soulja Slim day
February 4th, call it Pimp C day
So Icey hip hop, Waka Flock music
I don't need no metaphor, this is real music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some Pro Tools
Haters, they can hate, but '09, I'ma show you
Niggas in DC say they fucking with my music
Go-go Flocka like I'm from Landover
Bye bye, Regal, say hello to my chauffeur
My chauffeur, my chauffeur

[Hook]
This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music
This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music, nigga

[Verse 2]
First of all, Sammy Sam and Oomp Camp had a nigga crunk
And Kilo Ali and JD had me crunk
Lil Jon had these young niggas screaming "Yeah!"
Redman and Method Man had me smoking blunts
DMX music had a nigga acting grimey
Thirteen years ago, I'ma call that shit Freaknic
That's when mid and dro was in style
That one 559 had the A going wild
When Poon Daddy and Chris Lova ran the station
Fast forward time, now we in Central Station
In my trap house, listen to Gucci fucking bunking
Bunking, bunking, I'm in my trap house bunking
In the trap, hanging with them Hit Squad killers
When we made the news, I bet the whole hood felt us
In the trap, hanging with them Hit Squad killers
And when we made the news, I bet the whole hood felt us

This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music
This ain't metaphor, punchline music
This is real talk, I'm talking straight blunt music
Dr. Dre headphones, a mic and some music
All I need is Deb, I'ma make some good music, nigga
