[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I said I'm suited and booted
Wish a fuck nigga try
Homicide in my eyes, on the prize, youngin's juugin' selling five's
Swear to god, man I tell no lies
Niggas disrespect me then you know it's five-five

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
If you thuggin' then shoot it
Bricksquad is the movement
I already proved it, suit and tie
But I'm fucking with my hat boys
Five-nine to the skyline, got work I'm employed
E.S.P. to the M.O.B
Campenella, Louis Park, neighborhood
Bang your hood, but first throw them P's up
B's up, peace up
Brim boys in that Maybach
I been homie since way back, got an older cousin that's payback
I don't mind though
Pull my arm like Rondo, seventeen in that nine though
Flip that clip, on that strip, beat your chest, Congo
You a gang gangster, you ?
No money involved in your convo'
And I been thuggin' since a child, ?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ice Burgandy]
I said it's loot it or shoot it, my first tape I pyrooted
You would think I'm from Jamaica, Queens the way I do, do it
Half these rappers they just make believe, I'mma make 'em prove it
Niggas ain't taking shit from me, but a mo'fucking bullet
If I pull it, I'mma pop it, I'm the mo'fucking topic
Got a ? that I be fucking with, like ? and Rocket
I'm from Englewood City, but I be thuggin' out in Compton
I'll show you what two-fifty look like, stuffed up in my pockets
Burgandy on that Squad shit, Bricksquad bandana
Thirty in the clip, with it tied around the hammer
Outside, ? good, thuggin' in Atlanta
I bet you didn't know, Game used to claim Santana

[Hook]
