Yeah, bang, bang, get a tat and go
Ask Gucci, ask what, who the next to blow
Frenchie if you didn't know
Yes, shorty, like a tennis court
Fully on with that stripe, it ain't gonna be no tragedy
20 yard and he in front of me, joyless boy with the battery
Click clack who you gonna hit when a nigga like me going through your pockets
Don't get back, I'mma be your best friend while a nigga still '
It ain't no dodging the squad, you ain't gonna get that far
Scope don't fuck, don't feel, nigga, that's 100 yards
I'm bigger than a soccer field, garage of 100 cars
Hustler skills, they don't make them like me no more, too hard
Is he here back, ' homie, you'll see he'll be back
You are a world star? We don't believe that
You say it got what it take? We ain't seen that
Wear them down, nigga, no mask, nigga, give me that
Drip down nigga, fuck nigga, where the money at
Nigga act crazy I'mma get ' no kick back
100 round if a nigga want some get back
Last nigga try me get his ass in a shit bag
When we hop out on the side click clack
I'mma bring this beef to where motherfuckers sleep at
Ok, ok, so these niggas wanna beef, shot 300 times, you can call it Chief Kief
Shells on the ground, I don't see no beach
Niggas in the hood tryna be the next me '
38, 45's, Glock 9's, pistol in my hand came to the waist line
All black Akon, how you get money, blood, make bonds
'think James Bond, I got a lot of guns, big guns like '
Waka Flocka Flame, he the finest shooter 'that street shit
Been ten times, niggas switch their names, 3K when I switch that lane
Blow every cane with no top, eminent to top
We don't do nobody, shorty, that's a fact
My bullets in the act with a hater, keep it real, stay down, that's the major
Oh look, one time, feel a nigga major'
I do what I want, you do what you can, click, click bang
Wear them down, nigga, no mask, nigga, give me that
Drip down nigga, fuck nigga, where the money at
Nigga act crazy I'mma get ' no kick back
100 round if a nigga want some get back
Last nigga try me get his ass in a shit bag
When we hop out on the side click clack
I'mma bring this beef to where motherfuckers sleep at
Ok, ok, so these niggas wanna beef, shot 300 times, you can call it Chief Kief
Shells on the ground, I don't see no beach
Niggas in the hood tryna be the next me '
I'm strapped and you not so fall back or you shot
One Mac, I got two Glocks and I act like 2Pac
Tell 'em in a heartbeat nigga don't start me
Blow a nigga brains out, leave him apart these
I took a molly, fuck with my car keys
Try to get boost up hop in my Rrari
I ain't get no sneak up, brand new day
Shoot two threes in my brand new K
BRP's and my belt two G's '
Strap on bitch and her ass too fat
I know a nigga nice but who asked you that
I just got a zip and it's only for the clique
And you ain't on to this so I'll pass you that
No IOU's nigga, fuck, you pay, I'm not an OG, what the fuck you say
Let the young boys, let the strapper make noise
Niggas where you from is where the fuck you lay
Brick Squad, bitch, say it one more time
Brick Squad, bitch, say it one more time
'and this rap sheet here it just one more grind
Wear them down, nigga, no mask, nigga, give me that
Drip down nigga, fuck nigga, where the money at
Nigga act crazy I'mma get ' no kick back
100 round if a nigga want some get back
Last nigga try me get his ass in a shit bag
When we hop out on the side click clack

Ok, ok, so these niggas wanna beef, shot 300 times, you can call it Chief Kief
