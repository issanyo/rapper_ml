[Pre-Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Smoking crack I'm sick of bones
My dick big, my money long
These bad bitches love my dirty drawers
Make that ass clap round of applause
I love africans, let my money talk
Beggin' bitches that turn me off
Waka Flocka Flame how the squad balls
On the newest weed can't do a loss
If I wanna get it fuck what it cost
I got it nigga, I ain't runnin' out

[Verse 1: Future]
Got the [?], and it full to the top
I take a Swisher cigarillo and I think I can gut
Gotta put the red bottoms on her but I ain't in a rush
She [?]  her bitch twerked in the tub
I got some dope in my system, man I can't give it up
I'ma be the first nigga whip up in that new Bentley truck
Hit her with 4-4 like no joke, swear the lames got the game in a chokehold
I'm a different kind of breed gotta come true, no sleep I'm geeked when I come through
And these bitches get chopped like kung-fu, throw you fingers up in the air with the sun roof

[Hook: Future]
Whippin' that top with your left hand, splash splash water splash splash dipped in water
She give me brain that was insane, dipped my head in water
Ain't been the same since I put that cocaine on her
My trap house in the country got no dogs on it
I got a sofa and a TV and a stove in it
[?] gold rose on it
We got that old money, we got some old money
My new bitch is braver than me
Come and take this pill and get high with me
Come and take this pill and get high with me

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm fucked up, I'm wasted
Im too drunk I can't drive
This girl low but I'm high
These Balmain's like Levi's
All I need is one plug
One trap, one cell phone
You ain't talkin' money nigga, don't talk
Seen the whole ticket on a smartphone

[Pre-Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Smoking crack I'm sick of bones
My dick big, my money long

Make that ass clap round of applause
I love africans, let my money talk

On the newest weed can't do a loss

Come and take this pill and get high with me
