[Producer Tag]
That nigga, Lex Luger

[Chorus]
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stinking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the 'Dale with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga

[Verse 1]
Got a main bitch, got a mistress (what else?)
A couple girlfriends, I'm so hood rich
Keep my dick hard and keep me smoking
You'll get bills free, shawty, no joking
And what I stand for? Brick Squad
I'ma die for this shawty, man, I swear to God
In the trap with some killers and some hood niggas
Where you at? Where you trap? You ain't hood, nigga
Keep this shit 300, put that shit on my hood
Crips fucking with me, G's and the Vice Lords
Es√© and amigos freestyle off the dome
Brick Squad, Waka Flocka Flame is fucking home

[Chorus]
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stinking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the 'Dale with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga

[Verse 2]
What's up, pussy nigga? What's up, punk nigga?
They got on that nigga, make your momma's momma miss you
Hope you got your killers with you, hope you got your niggas with you
Hope your goons riding with you, they gon' fucking miss you, nigga
Nigga with a attitude like Eaze and Cube
When my little brother died, I said: "Fuck school!"
I picked the burner up, then I grabbed some marijuana
Two years later, screaming: "Now I'm here, your honor!"
Glock 9, the SK, if you want to beef
Shawty, point blank range, I'll put your ass to sleep
Shawty, talk is cheap so watch what your say
Broad day in the air like this shit legal
Desert Eagle, gold and back, that's to pull the trigger

[Chorus]
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stinking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the 'Dale with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga

[Break]
Flocka
Waka, Waka, Waka, Waka Flocka
Waka, Waka, Waka Flocka
Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Waka
Waka, Waka, Waka Flocka
Waka Flocka, Flocka, Waka
Waka Flocka Flame, Brick Squad
Brick Squad
Brick Squad

[Chorus]
I go hard in the motherfucking paint, nigga
Leave you stinking, nigga
What the fuck you thinking, nigga?
I won't die for this shit or what the fuck I say
Front yard, broad day with the SK
See Gucci, that's my motherfucking nigga
I hang in the 'Dale with them Hit Squad killers
Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga
