[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
On and off of tour, know it get stressful time and time
But don't stress about them whores you the only one that's on my mind
Just worrying about you baby
When I make it home you gon' make us go into a round 2 baby
Show that pussy no remorse
This is what it costs to be famous to buy them shoes you afford
Late night session after session, she can drive you a Porshe
Its what I sacrifice for that expensive taste you got to fill your appetite
I made our dreams come true
All them nights you stay awake I swear I make it worth it
Cause I appreciate your patience and that body so perfect
All the time I spent away I can't help but think about you baby
Facetime and the freaky things you say
When the flight land I be on my way, gone
