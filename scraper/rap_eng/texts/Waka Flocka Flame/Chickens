[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Turn up
DuFlockaRant, number 35
Loyalty
Never change my team, ya know?

[Hook x2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Them chickens go for 35, gotta run my money up
Them chickens go for 35, gotta run my money up
Sellin' weed, my pistol tucked
Sellin' weed, my pistol tucked
All I know is run it up
Got got gotta run my money up

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
All my life been sellin' birds
Bag 'em up and watch 'em fly
You the killa, you get killed
Where I'm from, it's do or die
Been to jail a hundred times and I ain't never dropped a dime
All my homies walk with Rollies, we ain't scared of gettin' time
See me?
Skip college, Chose cocaine, tote proper
I'm a grown man, no problem
If you need work, I got it
Can't tell these young niggas shit
Cause we done came from the bottom
Still got my hand on my hammer
That's a nail in yo coffin'
One Pac came wit that lama
And walk up out with that chopper
I give ten Gs to my shooter
Mail yo' head to yo mamma, nigga
Two birds in my back, I got two birds in my back
I sell one to get bread; I keep one to get head
Come on

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Them chickens go for 35, gotta run my money up
Sellin' weed, my pistol tucked
All I know is run it up
I'll go haul up in my cut
Git cops don't testify
Loyalty before, royalty for my niggas
I'm a ride 'til the end, 'til the end, 'til the end
All I know is hustle, grind 'til I make a fuckin' mill
Keep it real
Real street, nigga, all I know is run it up
Run run run it up, all I know is run it up

[Verse 3: P. Reign]
I'm a hit where it hurt
Watch me hit, watch me work
Put a pigeon in the pot, the birdie's dead
So watch 'em twerk
I don't care what block you check
Throw yo' hood, bang yo' set
Bitch it's OVO and Reps
Raise my name so don't get wet
If y'all niggas scared of them cops
Better switch your occupation
Like damn, my block so hot
The fiends come to vacation
Cut it, whip it, slang
I ain't no pimp but I walk with that caine
Ain't got no limp but I walk with that caine
Got 36 chambers, protect your neck
Wu-Tang
You know what I pay for them thangs
Prolly what I pay for these chains
Only fuck with bitches that graduated
Cause I'm in love with them brains
Chickens go for thirty five, you betta pay the price
Or that will be yo' death
Welcome to the life, I say
