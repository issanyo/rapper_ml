So much money in my house I'm having cold sweats
Throwing bands in the club they sending death threats
Donald Trump bank account, you can call it that
Jacksons, Franklins, I can never see a debt
Keith Flocka Sweat, my face got her pussy wet
Million dollar mob deal, I’m a blow the whole cheque
All in Perfection, Sue’s, Sin City
Oh let do it, my town fresh it’s called Diddy
Monday Magic City, fucking King of Diamonds
Saying Flocka broke, shit, you talking ebonics, what?!
I’m from the Southside nigga Clayco
Jurassic Park squad, you can call it that
