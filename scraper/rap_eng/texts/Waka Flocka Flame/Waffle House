[Hook: Strap]
Breakfast at the Waffle House, twenty sausage biscuits
Hold on, excuse me, ma'am, what come on a sausage biscuit?
Twenty more orange juice, twenty more biscuits
Got my team together, now that's twenty naked bitches

[Verse 1: Strap]
I-N-T-O-X-I-C-A-T-E-D
I can barely even see
I'm higher than a plane, drunker than a fuck face
I forgot my name, trying to sit up straight
I can't maintain, DUI
I'm so fucked up, I can barely even drive
One blunt, two blunt, three blunt, four
Drink, drink, drink, drink, smoke, smoke, smoke

Oh my God, what is going on?
Man, I'm drunk and smoking strong, got a nigga super stoned
Oh my God, this fat bitch look so pretty
And she got some big old titties and she acting real siddity
Like, oh my God, I'm talking 'bout my head
My eyes are very red, I don't wanna go to bed
Oh my God, give me steak and cheese
I got, like, fifteen orders, so just send the waiter, please

[Verse 3: Quez]
Just left the club, 'bout to hit the Waffle House
Man, I'm drunk as fuck, what the hell he talmbout?
I said I want a steak and cheese, but man, I want a waffle now
Can't make up my mind, I think I want a Whopper now
Breakfast at the Waffle House, twenty sausage biscuits
Twenty more orange juice and twenty naked bitches
Feeling buck 50, man, you know I blew that
A sausage, biscuit, meat, and bread, no, I never knew that

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
This ain't iHop, this the Waffle House
Know how we rock, put it in her mouth
All-star meal for my five-star bitch
The way the girl walking, swear she'd get a nigga rich
Michael Vick my eggs with cheese, yeah, I love them scrambled
Turn up, mad as fuck, been in line for about thirty minutes
Turn up, bacon, egg, and cheese that'll get her on her knees
Two words to the waitress: "Check, please"
