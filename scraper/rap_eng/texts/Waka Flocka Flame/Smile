[Intro]
Yo, I said, it's early in the morning
And all I see is money when I'm yawning, nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo, I said it's early in the morning and I'm still in the studio
Trying to cook my next hit single, catch a movie role
Know a nigga winning when you getting 50k
Getting money three ways, I can never see a rainy day
Millions off my wordplay, pray every chance I get
Bullshit irrelevant, narcotics I be selling it
In the hood kicking shit, drinking beers, gangsta shit
Never let these hating niggas take me out my element
They say my flow heaven sent (smile)

[Chorus]
Every chance I get, man, I'ma fucking smile
Even if they try to knock me on the ground (smile)
Every chance I get, I'ma smile
Even if they try to knock me on the ground, I'ma (smile)
Even if I don't wanna I'ma (smile)
Even if I don't wanna I'ma smile
Never let you see me frown
Never could you hold me down

[Verse 2]
Flag out my pocket, dog it's unity, respect each other
Love a friend like a brother, dog, all I know is loyalty
Dug the penitentiary, my niggas move a quarterly
Success, I hear it calling me, my downfall, bet you wanna see
But unfortunately, I'm a fucking smile every chance I get
Never let a person's words take me out my element
Them lies, I ain't buying it, so ain't no need for selling it
When you push me down on the ground, I ain't gon' frown
I'ma motherfucking (smile)

[Chorus]
Every chance I get, man, I'ma fucking smile
Even if they try to knock me on the ground (smile)
Every chance I get, I'ma smile
Even if they try to knock me on the ground, I'ma (smile)
Even if I don't wanna I'ma (smile)
Even if I don't wanna I'ma smile
Never let you see me frown
Never could you hold me down
