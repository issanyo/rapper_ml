[Intro]
Ha! This dem Ferrari Boyz - catch up!
BURR! Catch up! Catch up!

[Gucci Mane]
She stoned, she stoned, she gone off that Patron
I gave that bitch a hundred dollars just to leave me 'lone
Tell the waitress bring mo' bottles up cause she can keep the chaser
Lil' momma switchin by my section she want me to chase her (NOPE)
Wasted on moscato, but I'm losin my patience
I'm tellin her come go with me but all her homegirls hatin (FUCK 'EM)
Like Fred Flintstone, I'm a rolling stone (STONE)
My best friend is Barney so you know I'm rollin strong (STRONG)
Shawty in the zone, dress with the thong
Every nigga in the club tryin to take her home (GUCCI)
Shawty in the zone, dress with the thong
And every player in the club tryin to take her home (Gucci)

[Hook: Gucci Mane (Waka Flocka)]
Ay let's get stoned (stoned) I'm so stoned
Like Fred Flintstone, I got a partner named Barney
And he keep me in the zone, the whole club stoned
The whole world stoned, and tonight we 'bout to party
Like we just came home; ay let's get stoned (stoned)
Like Fred Flintstone, I got a partner named Barney
And he keep me in the zone, the whole club stoned
The whole world stoned, tonight we 'bout to party like we just came home

[Waka Flocka Flame]
Put your blunts in air, hookahs in the air
Put your lighter in the air if you tryin to get stoned
Tonight I'm puttin on, I swear to God I'll survive
Bitch I am that high! Yes I am stoned
Drinkin on Obama, it's rainin white liquor
Gucci pass the dutches(Burr), I don't do no Swishers
Rock yellow stones, rock red stones
Bitch my money long, poppin pills and blowin strong
I'm a 'Stone Cold' flexer, Steve Austin (stunner)
Every concert man I'm gone (flex) stoned
In my zone hater leave me alone, be gone
Bird chains in the air - screamin this our yea

[Hook]

[Waka Flocka Flame]
When you hear this song (Crazy)
The crowd gon' be jumpin up and down(AHHHHHHHH)
Screamin I'm stoned! (I'm stoned!)
White Remy Martin can't drink Patron
Lost my keys I can't even make it home

[Gucci Mane]
E'rybody in here gone, all my homeboys stoned
My dogs just came home, ball like the Georgia Dome
Thinkin - it's back on, drinkin - that there Patron
It's over, I'm loaded, we toasted, we grown

[Hook]
