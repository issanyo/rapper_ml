[Intro]
We gon get it on
We gon get it on

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
And we gon get it on
We gon get it on
I know what you want
Yeah I know what you want

[Verse 1: Bei Maejor]
Lil mama want her hair pulled
Legs pushed back
Only like a Rottweiler in the kitty cat
She want it wild
Shawty wanna scream
Want it from the front, back, side, and in between
Want it all the time, she a fiend
So good, I see it in my dreams
She wanna arch her back when I hit it
When I do it mama wanna holla get it
She said

[Bridge: Bei Maejor]
Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time to, time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, lights down low

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
And we gon get it on
We gon get it on
I know what you want
Yeah I know what you want

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
She said I'm going too fast, take it slow
So I slapped her on the ass, start pullin' on her hair
She nibbles on my ear like boy it's good
She love the way I'm tellin' how a nigga keep it hood
Give it to me daddy, that's what she keeps screamin, give it to me daddy
She love the way I beat it She wish that I can repeat it
I got her in a trance Man I'm even fuckin friends
Got 'her blowing like the wind She's shaking, got me impatient
Back and forth pacin', man I need my medication
Lights down low so we gettin' naughty
Making fuck faces, she ride me like a Harley

[Bridge: Bei Maejor]
Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time to, time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, lights down low

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
And we gon get it on
We gon get it on
I know what you want
Yeah I know what you want
