[Intro: Travis Porter & Waka Flocka Flame]
Travis Porter!
What the hell you talmbout?

[Hook: Travis Porter]
Hit the club, jumped the whole line (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck a quarter, man, we get the whole pound (hell you talmbout?)
Said that I ain't got it on me right now? (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck around the whole hood hold me down (the hell you talmbout?)
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
What the hell you talmbout?

[Verse 1: Quez of Travis Porter]
Travis Porter hit the lick, but Zone 6 kicking it
Receipts from ATM got the bad girls feeling it
Travis Porter, Waka, Frenchie, man this shit ridiculous
Drop that "Turnt Up" and got the whole hood feeling it
Riverdale to East Atlanta, man, I know you sick of it
Oh let's do it, staying on some pimping shit
Never know what I'ma say, the way that I be flipping it
I never got a hit, man, the way that I be pitching it

[Hook: Travis Porter]
Hit the club, jumped the whole line (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck a quarter, man, we get the whole pound (hell you talmbout?)
Said that I ain't got it on me right now? (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck around the whole hood hold me down (the hell you talmbout?)
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
What the hell you talmbout?

[Verse 2: Frenchie]
What the hell he talking bout? I don't think you understand
I got stacks on top of stacks, my wallet is rubberbands
F-R-E-N-C-H-I-E
I said it in my last rhyme, but it's the last time that a nigga try me
Brick Squad and Travis Porter, let's get this game in order
Slim Dunkin with Waka Flame, cruising in your daughter
A hundred niggas at the door, bet I'ma jump the line
I ain't got no time to wait, patience come with time

[Verse 3: Ali of Travis Porter]
I might dress this way, but don't take it wrong
What you think they call me Ali for? I'll crack your dome
Oh my God, so don't come at me wrong
Travis is so icey, we like 5-0 strong
Oh my God, oh my God, so I suggest you not
The whole East Atlanta with me, what the hell you talking bout?
Getting money, getting money is all these niggas talk bout
I ain't never flexed up in my song, the hell you talking 'bout?

[Hook: Travis Porter]
Hit the club, jumped the whole line (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck a quarter, man, we get the whole pound (hell you talmbout?)
Said that I ain't got it on me right now? (hell you talmbout?)
Fuck around the whole hood hold me down (the hell you talmbout?)
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
The hell you talmbout?
What the hell you talmbout?

[Verse 4: Strap of Travis Porter]
All the way turnt up
Drunk as fuck, jumping off the furniture
Breakfast at the Waffle House, twenty sausage biscuits
Hold up, excuse me, ma'am, what come on a sausage biscuit?
Hold up, freeze, let me get my team
Call my nigga Flocka, tell him bring the whole thing
Now, who the hell you talking bout? Who the hell are you?
Say you got a pistol, who the hell you gon' shoot?

[Verse 5: Waka Flocka Flame]
I love the way they run they mouth, my name is always in they mouth
I'll have them run up in your house, if I was you, I'd watch my mouth
Gwalla in my wallet, I got gwallas in my pocket
I got M-O-N-E-Y, Brick Squad, Brick Squad till I die
In the club high, yes, I'm always fresh and fly
Man, I'm fly like a bird plus I'm high like a plane
It could be the first of June, I can bring May back
Hell you talmbout? Have them goons run ASAP
Waka Flocka
