[Intro: Pesci]
Forgot what its all about huh?
Staring at the world
All I see is a bunch of fake ass bitches
Fuck ass niggas
Fuck y'all know about a nigga like me man
You ain't never seen my kind before
And if u took something from me nigga
Fuck you

[Hook: Pesci]
Whatchu know about me?
You don't bleed the same blood I bleed
Addicted to the drama indeed
Keep a bad bitch with me just to roll my weed
Yeah, and I'm a real OG
Pop a bottle like my name Coby
Rick opened up the club so g
V8 with it, show up in my new Chevy

[Verse 1: Pesci]
Bottom of the ninth inning
Start on the ending
Blood money new religion
Fast money true religion
With a bitch, wing shit
Fuck around and get nailed like a crucifix
I got a life, who would that duce be
Be on the news pimping
See u on the news snitching
Try and stop us I got 5 choppers
Sipping lime vodka
Watching phantom of the opera
And I be on the same shit as Waka
I'm in the brink with my connect
He listening to the broncos
Call me Osama, Obama
Presidential terrorist
I am drama
I am karma
But payback is a bitch I fell in love with
So kiss her revolver
You must got a death wish partner
Basically you're dead
I'm a monster for real nigga

[Hook: Pesci]
Whatchu know about me?
You don't bleed the same blood I bleed
Addicted to the drama indeed
Keep a bad bitch with me just to roll my weed
Yeah, and I'm a real OG
Pop a bottle like my name Coby
Rick opened up the club so g
V8 with it, show up in my new Chevy

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I said I paid my dues
Blood sweat and tears
I'm a motherfucking white G, G
Riverdale Road, I'm from Riverdale Road
I'm from Clayton County
Yeah lighters in the air
Lets role the blunts
I'm trying to get fucked up and ease my stress
My dawgs done got locked up, 8 show
3 life sentences plus 18 years down
Misguidance, loyalty to gang banging
All a nigga know is violence
Who are you to blame me for what I grew up in
I'm a product of my environment
To the ones living that lifestyle know the road your going down
Amen, say my prayers before I eat
Pray for all the ones that behind a g, weak
I miss you D-Moss

[Hook: Pesci]
Whatchu know about me?
You don't bleed the same blood I bleed
Addicted to the drama indeed
Keep a bad bitch with me just to roll my weed
Yeah, and I'm a real OG
Pop a bottle like my name Coby
Rick opened up the club so g
V8 with it, show up in my new Chevy
