[Hook: Fly-Ty]
Real niggas I fuck with 'em, fake niggas my guns get 'em
My brother gone, I don't trust niggas
Shooter with me, that young nigga
So what nigga, I call shots
Say it's beef, then I'm on your block
I'm talking broad day, around four o' clock
Call the cops, the Squad late
Go hard, I don't care if I slip up and hit the wrong person
I don't care, them shells bumping
You can't take the heat
Kill mine, you better pray to god your ass live through the whole week

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Real niggas, I fuck with 'em
You a lame nigga, can't fuck with 'em
You came with them, better fight with them
When I shoot at y'all, you better duck with 'em
I'm a Squad nigga, so my chain icy
Car new, and my gun big
Bitch fat with a fake ass
Some fake titties, but she bad as shit
Country nigga, diamond teeth
Country nigga, big rims
Country nigga, old car with no top I'm a hood star
Country nigga, diamond teeth
Country nigga, big rims
Country nigga, old car with no top I'm a hood star

[Verse 2: Yung Joey]
Real nigga, I fuck with 'em
Fake fuck from around here
Fuck nigga, don't fuck around
Fuck around and get found here
F.L. shoot chopper shells, leave you gooey like pasta shells
Look 'em in the eyes, wanna see the same look that my partner had when my partner fell
I'm on one, I got two with me
Swaying me, I don't need a crew with me
Me and Fly Ty in the same whip, busting at niggas with the same clip
Lame shit, don't condone it
Fuck shit, I be on it
Bloody murder to my enemies, and I slap the shit out of opponents
So high, I got jet lag
Four-five, and my bitch bad
Kick back like Jet Li
If I lick a shot, you get whip-lashed
I'm still drunk from last night, can't remember shit
Asked little mama what's on her mind, all she remembered is dick

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fred The Godson]
Real niggas, I fuck with 'em
Hoes spar, Rosa Park
Meaning these the niggas I'mma bus with
Beef ain't done, who you getting tough with?
Plus we play with them choppers, you may try to stop us
One shot go blocka', on the block got me packa
I can hit 'em on sight, I can hit 'em one night, I can hit 'em two nights
Silencers screw type, know what my crew like
Big bananas on the hammer, turn into a food fight
Fred ? , viva clique
Got a couple shooters from Puerto Rico
But we gotta move it and defend the streets though
They say that I'm the best in the industry, go
