[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
They don’t call us like that
You’re calling names
I’ve been rich, homie, some type of way I’m stove top, y’all microwave
Take my time, so respect the grind
You’ve seen the threats, my set’ll ride either you’re tellin’ lies
Or you’re fakin’ , nigga
I’m getting love, you’e hatin’ , nigga I’ve seen you shows
They’re fake , nigga I won’t wait on
And I can give a fuck of somebody’s feelin’
I got wroth a play
I got worth a play Hush nigga
You’ll lean one day I’m an underpaid, don’t turn away
Let’s box it out, I’ll beat your ass I see the snakes, I like the grass
Hit the strip stack the cash
Count the money, do the math I’m too cool
For this round up I’m too real, too cool for rap

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Belaire, D'usse, don't care what you say
I be bombing on drama like Saddam Hussein
Big body black Benz hogging two lanes
Big, lack heat hot as two blue flames
Young nigga move that dope
Nigga, move that hard, nigga, move that soft
Nigga, move that raw, nigga, get that off
Pushers be pushing, dealers be slanging
Banana clip on the bottom of the stick hanging
And I'm riding with that thing too, show you what my name do
Took a rough left quicker than I came through
Living legend in the kitchen chefing
While the sunlight bouncing off my wrist and Chevy
Thug nigga, drug dealer, none realer, they just rebels
I'm the entrée, main course, they just samples
Two dice, three dice, major gambles
Woodgrain in the whip like it came with campers

[Verse 3: Master-Solo]
You can't come across this
Shit's fucking awesome when i toss this
Straight from the underground
Who's the boss of the crown?
Late to back down, should've lay no plate
Don't play, straight beat down
I represent all the wack MCs to jump straight off the fucking valley
