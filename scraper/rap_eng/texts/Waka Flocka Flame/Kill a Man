[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
My flag Waka Flocka, I be flamed up
She say I throw my money with so much anger
Reckless eyeballs in the club, middlefinger
Blowin' kush, I'm the nigga, fuck a hater
Watch cost 30, bracelet cost 40
Chain cost a 100, man, I ball all year
You just ball for a weekend, shit, my nigga, I'm treatin'
What yo' bitch drinkin'? I bet her pussy leakin'
I'll turn a nun out, I'll have her freakin'
These ex pills got me sweatin', God damn a nigga rollin'
If she look, she tooken, nigga, you know the rules
These bitches love my swag, thank you, Pro Tools

[Hook: Zuse]
My bankroll too big for a rubberband
Car load, trunk load, full of kilograms
Kingston killer, I don't give a damn
Fuck around with my money, I'mma kill a man
Kill a man, me, I'mma kill a man
Brooklyn, Kingston, I'mma kill a man
A-Town niggas don't give a damn
Fuck with my money, I'mma kill a man

[Verse 2: 5ive Mics]
Bankroll too big, can't fold it up
All you fake rap niggas can't fuck with us
Remy, peach Crush, my double cup - AK that choppa
Nigga, 5ive Mics and Waka, yeah, Zooly Gang is my shottas
Blood gang and I'm kingpin, A-Town and Kingston
I know murderers and killers, goons and gorillas
I'm worldwide but I'm certified, ho, Instagram my pictures
Uh, New York so what's poppin'? I'm racked up and I got it
Nigga, rob me, I got it, got a hundred rounds and I'm bout it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Zuse]
All I ever wanted was to make cake
You the nigga tryna flex in a fake chain
All I ever did was remain same
Yeah, I stayed true while you had to change, fool
Young god gon' get it when the fame due
Wit' the same crew, nah, we don't hate you
You hate you knowing that you fake too
Now everybody sayin' that I made you

[Hook]
