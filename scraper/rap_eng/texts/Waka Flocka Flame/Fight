[Intro: Kebo Gotti]
One-on-one, two-on-two, what you wanna do?
Get your partner, tell your clique, run and call your crew
Say you wanna walk, what's your hand game like?
Ain't no tools in this club, bitch, we finna fight

[Chorus: Kebo Gotti and Waka Flocka Flame]
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)

[Verse 1: Slam Dunkin]
Oh shit, y'all done fucked up
Got the wrong crew mad, tell them good luck
What you gonna do when they come for you?
Hit Squad, Brick Squad, Dirt Gang, too
Fighting and we throwing bottles
Run up and we throwing hollows
Anybody get it, from the gangstas to the supermodels
You big dummy, bet you're sweet like honey
Bitch, I'm down to fight, Flocka got my bond money
Put the Glock in his mouth like some Listerine
Or the Ruger in his eye like some Vasine
Everything was all good just a week ago
Now he in box, pizza, pizza, hoe

[Chorus: Kebo Gotti and Waka Flocka Flame]
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)

[Verse 2: Kebo Gotti]
It's Kebo Gotti in this motherfucker
I ain't scared of nobody in this motherfucker
I wish a nigga would try me in this motherfucker
I got a killer punch, you would get bodied in this motherfucker
I'm a beast, standing 200 solid
I hollered, "Squad up", there go a riot
All outside his noggin, then upside her derriere
Squad niggas throwing bottles, squad niggas throwing chairs
We don't care, we out of control
I'm 'bout to lose my mind, my mind is so gone
Yes, so gone 'cause everything green
If I holler, "Squad up", bitch, you know what that mean: fight

[Chorus: Kebo Gotti and Waka Flocka Flame]
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
Nigga in the club popping at the mouth
Talking loud, making a scene, ay, we gon' stomp him out
You must be drunk, nigga, gone off that vodka
Capp, Gotti, Waka, somebody call a doctor
Ain't no bucking over here, you're getting your ass whooped
Get your chain snatched, get your cash took
Get your girl fucked, we'll fuck your girl up
One hitter quitter, nigga, it's too late to curl up
You ain't touching me, don't think about rushing me
A hundred green flags, I got goons that'll bust for free
But we in the club and it's time to fight
It's going down, swing on a nigga you don't like

[Chorus: Kebo Gotti and Waka Flocka Flame]
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight
Fight, fight, bitch, we finna fight (Hit Squad)
What's your hand game like? (Brick Squad)
What's your hand game like?
East side (my boys down to fight)
West side (them boys down to fight)
North side (them boys down to fight)
South side (boy, we down to fight)

[Outro: Tay Beatz]
All pussy ass niggas left in the motherfucking edge right now, my nigga
Hit Squad, Brick Squad, Dirt Gang in this bitch?
Oh man, we gotta get the fuck out of here, my nigga
And Tay Beatz in this bitch, nigga?
Ay, Chaz, don't knock a nigga out to this one
Pussy ass niggas gon' fuck around and shoot up this bitch
