[Verse 1]
Gang gang nigga, you can't hang nigga
You a strange nigga, we on painkillers
Hate lame niggas, worth 8 figures
Tell the feds come and get it
Fuck the pigs, middle fingers
In my hood we clutching bangers
My young drop switch the bangers
This is hip-hop lil nigga, better grip a Glock nigga
You know how we rocking nigga, pull up with them rockets nigga
My lil shooter James Harden, he got aim, he got range
With that yoppa he go Waka Flocka Flame (yuh yuh)
Cross the line, we gon bust yo fucking brain (yuh yuh)
You a crip? You a blood? Nigga, what the fuck you banging?
If a rapper drop my name, pop his chain, that's on gang gang

[Verse 2]
My lil hoe on the powder, 'fore we fuck, bitch take a shower
Got the money and the power, get my dick sucked sucked smoking dour
Heard a baby daddy sour, heard them death threats from that coward
Fuck a foreign in that Chevy and that motherfucker mounted
If I say then I'm bout it, if I point then I'm 'bout it
Bitch you know a nigga vegan
Bitch you know I don't do beef
Bitch you know we don't do sit-downs
Bitch you know there ain't no peace
Put the plastic on the walls, [?] grab the fucking bleach
Gangster from my head to feet, even they grandma know I'm G
Pockets full, yours on E, don't do freestyles, ain't shit free
You a rap nigga to me, only trap niggas with me
Trade a feature for a key, keep that shit in the streets
