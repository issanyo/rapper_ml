[Intro]
Grove (Brick Squad), Street
Flocka

[Chorus]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin'
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
My partner on a pill, my other partner drunk
Roll up the loud, I'm trying to get fucked up
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party

[Verse 1]
I stepped in the club, rolling up that loud shit
My weed keep your security saying, "Be quiet"
My bread just start a riot, the girls get excited
Hold on, want to try it? I'm like, "Why not try it?"
My swag, they want to buy it, my juice, they want to try it
Club going stupid, when I "O Let's Do It"
Jewelry got her chewin', juggin' and she movin'
Grove Street villain, nigga, who you killing?
Broke two years ago, now I'm worth a million
Jacksons to the ceiling, that's how we ballin'
You know that I'm rollin', throwing up a mean bag
Now I'm off the meter, in the club with a heater

[Chorus]
I got a whole lot of money, bitches count it for me
Bottles keep poppin', that's why the bad hoes jockin' (Whoo Kid)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party (Whoo Kid)
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party (Brick Squad)
