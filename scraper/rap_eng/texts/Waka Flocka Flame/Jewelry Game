[Hook]
My wrist, my watch, my chain
My wrist, my watch, my chain
My wrist, my watch, my chain
My wrist, my watch, my chain
Jewelry game, murder
Jewelry game, murder
Jewelry game, murder
Murder, murder
Jewelry game, murder
Jewelry game, murder
Jewelry game, murder
Murder, murder

[Verse 1]
Pull up, let the window down
Pull up on [?] like Boyz n da Hood
You playing turn your ass into Ricky
Cook juug, cook juug, work the kitchen
Got a young nigga, trigger finger itching
Half of yall niggas snitching
Rest of yall fuck niggas bitching
Got the game fucked up, now it's glitching
Still walk around town, talk missing
Yall ain't never seen a chicken
Yall ain't never post bail
Bitch ass tell em before you see jail
I'm a Clayton County nigga, in that Phantom
We don't like you, when we see you
Lil Shawty, that's your ass
See me chain, half a milli, all platinum, like my [?]
At my concert throwing gang signs, niggas going fast
Jewelry game murder
You want it, we gonna serve ya
[?], booling blowing purple

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All yellow Vette around like a Pikachu
Wore a million worth of jewelry to a interview
Oh you mad cuz them hoes ain't into you?
Or you mad cuz them hoes don't remember you?
Bunch of wet niggas, you should've bought a swimming suit
So much money, squeeze em ducks, can't swim through
White car, red top, that's the Bentley coupe
Shooters on deck, that's the gym crew
Big ass chopper shoot two-two-threes
Wrap 'em by the door, what you selling, weed
Why you can't tell a bird, say your price ain't cheap
Hoxton Jeans on my legs, Timberlands on my feet
See this ice, cost your life
If you reach, lose your life
Now move, I got stripes
I'm a big homie, real right
You cross me, good night
All this ice on my neck, no injury
Keep it one hundred like a century
You broke, nigga, no sympathy
Niggas Rollie face in the industry
It'll blow your mind like Kennedy
My watch face color [?]
My money long, no limit, g
I'm in the jewelry store, flexing
Rocking names you've never heard of
Hit a J, for my chain, flooded
Now it's murder

[Hook]
