[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
They tried to put me in my grave
By throwin' dirt up on my name, okay
Sometimes your woes turn into foes
You know how the sayin' goes
Gotta keep the grass low, no snakes
You know I dab on my haters, dab
Dab on my haters, dab
And I feel bad for my haters, bad
Cause I dab on my haters, dab

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
SQUAAAD!
Dabbin' on 'em, I'm about to go All-Madden on 'em
They gon' need more paddin' on 'em
Goin' Zero Dark Thirty, Bin Ladin on 'em
From the south side, Clayton County, homie
Hold the ball like your boy got ransom on it
You in the friend zone, romancin', homie
I'm in the end zone, and I'm dancin', homie
Flocka Flame, I'm back again
You asked me once, don't ask again
Hit the sack and I'm stackin' and stackin' ends
Linebacker like flash, won't pass again
Cam Newton, that's the young gun
Peyton Manning, that's the O.G
Ain't a man alive I'll run from
Better pay up if you owe me
You know me, I'm goin' off now
You know you fools done lost now
I was Gucci's goon, I'm a boss now
All you gettin' lost in the sauce now
I ain't mad at y'all, I feel bad for y'all
Watch out for the snakes, they're trappin' y'all
Ain't a safety that save me or tackle y'all
Champagne for the pain, I'ma laugh it off

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
They tried to put me in my grave
By throwin' dirt up on my name, okay
Sometimes your woes turn into foes
You know how the sayin' goes
Gotta keep the grass low, no snakes
You know I dab on my haters, dab
Dab on my haters, dab
And I feel bad for my haters, bad
Cause I dab on my haters, dab

[Verse 2: K. Camp]
Dab on 'em, get that cash on 'em
I said, "Dab on 'em," throw the flag on 'em
Look, understand I'm the boy
Catchin' plays like McCoy
Catchin' plays like Emmitt
I'ma get mine and handle my business
Ready or not, say the word, here I come
I make the call, I'm on field like a ref
I make the call, I'm on field like a coach
Dab... I'm doin' the most
Dab... I am the GOAT
Dab... I am the pope
Shawty know this her theme song
And I guarantee we bring rings home

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Let's give 'em all a reason to be envious
Never took a loss, we only win, that's why they envy us
Can't you hear that engine burn? We call that motivation
Heavy in the game, get your weight up
Watch me dab on a hater

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
They tried to put me in my grave
By throwin' dirt up on my name, okay
Sometimes your woes turn into foes
You know how the sayin' goes
Gotta keep the grass low, no snakes
You know I dab on my haters, dab
Dab on my haters, dab
And I feel bad for my haters, bad
Cause I dab on my haters, dab

They tried to put me in my grave
By throwin' dirt up on my name, okay
Sometimes your woes turn into foes
You know how the sayin' goes
Gotta keep the grass low, no snakes
You know I dab on my haters, dab
Dab on my haters, dab
And I feel bad for my haters, bad
Cause I dab on my haters, dab

[Outro]
You know I dab on my haters, dab
Dab on my haters, dab
And I feel bad for my haters, bad
Cause I dab on my haters, dab
