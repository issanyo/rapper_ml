[Intro: RIchmond Rab]
Huh?
Oh, you can't stand me bitch, huh?
Well, sue me, then, bitch, 'cause pimping is pimping
Pimping is pleasure, hoe

[Chorus: Nyemiah Supreme & Richmond Rab]
Boy, I can't stand you (she said she got a dude)
Boy, I can't stand you (and I be acting rude)
Boy, I can't stand you, nigga, kick rocks
Boy, I can't stand you,, you must pay for that box
Boy, I can't stand you (I told that bitch, "Please")
Boy, I can't stand you (I see she want a G)
Boy, I can't stand you (Look, bitch, I'm a boss)
Boy, I can't stand you (listen, get lost, go on)

[Verse 1: Richmond Rab]
Girl, you can't stand who? I can be your man, boo
Me and you is so old, why you acting brand new?
You was just a hoodrat, just something that I ran through
Open up your mouth wide, I know how your glands do
Come up out your bra, matter of fact, yeah, your pants, too
Tell me Vicky's secret or this whole shit is canceled
You ain't got a man, you do that same shit that Pam do
Just like Marty Mar, get to stepping out my Lambo
Girl, that's my Lambo, you just want a sample
You can just keep moving, you got corns all on your damn toes
Whistles in the trunk would turn the block into a dance floor
Strip still jumping, fiends asking where the grams go
Chickens and some water, I ain't cooking up no Campbell's
You don't understand, though, I'm trying to let my fans know
I can cook an ounce and a half off a damn O
I can cook an ounce and a half off a damn O

[Chorus: Nyemiah Supreme & Richmond Rab]
Boy, I can't stand you (she said she got a dude)
Boy, I can't stand you (and I be acting rude)
Boy, I can't stand you, nigga, kick rocks
Boy, I can't stand you,, you must pay for that box
Boy, I can't stand you (I told that bitch, "Please")
Boy, I can't stand you (I see she want a G)
Boy, I can't stand you (Look, bitch, I'm a boss)
Boy, I can't stand you (listen, get lost, go on)

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
I can't stand a broke bitch that demands shit
Ain't have shit, wearing her best friend's shit
I got a New York bitch that I call "Broomstick"
'Cause she suck up and she got a mean [?}
But my L.A. hoe, I swear she blows the best dro
And my Memphis chick, she gutter, she'll lick a bitch
Up in North Carolina back down to South Carolina
I'm fucking sisters, aunties, even baby mommas
Keith Flocka Sweat, leave a bitch pussy wet
This shit intense, shawty, so she might break a sweat
She licking on my neck, I whispered in her ear
"Is this dick good?" She like, "Hell yeah
Don't stop, right there, baby, that's the spot"
I don't do the cuffing, shawty, man, I hate the cops
Earrings, wrist and watch, reached for my chain
I'ma fight murder cases like Gucci Mane

[Chorus: Nyemiah Supreme & Richmond Rab]
Boy, I can't stand you (she said she got a dude)
Boy, I can't stand you (and I be acting rude)
Boy, I can't stand you, nigga, kick rocks
Boy, I can't stand you,, you must pay for that box
Boy, I can't stand you (I told that bitch, "Please")
Boy, I can't stand you (I see she want a G)
Boy, I can't stand you (Look, bitch, I'm a boss)
Boy, I can't stand you (listen, get lost, go on)
