[Chorus:]
I C U niggas faking, you ain’t really got it
I C U niggas faking, you don’t really want it
I C U niggas faking, that shit ain’t a hundred
I C U niggas faking, I C U niggas faking
I C U niggas faking, I C U niggas
I C U niggas faking, I C U niggas faking
I C U niggas faking, I C U niggas
I C U niggas, I C U nigga

[Verse 1:]
Salute me or just shoot me, you know how am rocking
Sell, go rob, nigga I ain’t have an option
Everybody acting killer, ain’t nobody is dropping
You can tell a real shooter, when they pistol popping
Your girl a easy fuck, I ain’t take her shopping
She say you don’t fuck her right, I got that pussy running
What’s a AP and am rolling, for that shit ain’t nothing
I’m in Europe, I’m in Asia, Fucking Bali
I follow Reggae like a head of money calling
Say he want to F a brick in a back of dolphin
Say your trap house booming, dem am gooms lurkey
For the bread, I C U and two surgeons

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
He said he ain’t fucking with that white boy, Matt Ryan
He go get rich, or go get fat trying
You don’t live that lifestyle, boy you just ripening
OG just got eighteen years and he’s still triping
Bunch of acting ass niggas, you deserve a Oscar
Pull up on your F-er skirt, bow wacka flocka
They don’t know how it really feel to bust a choppa
Or go to war and come back home without your partner
Blood, what the fuck you do? Range on the south side
Get these like a fucking zoo
Play my young, niggas,not the fight, just a fucking show
I ain’t got to lift a finger, send my new recruit

[Chorus]
