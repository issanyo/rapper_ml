Trap-a-Holics mixtapes!
FLOCKA! Man, I'm in the building, man. It's another mixtape, man. Trap-a-Holics! Kevin DuFlockaRant! I'm ten toes down! Ten toes down, man. Everything's a go. Everything's a must, man. I must drop a hundred songs per month. That's how I'm feeling right now. I'm going hard, man. I'm balling. Number 35, man. They should be selling my jersey. FLOCKA!
