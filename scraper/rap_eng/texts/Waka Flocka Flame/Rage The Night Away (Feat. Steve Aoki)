[Intro:]
We alive right now
Let's get high right now!

[Verse 1:]
We don't give a damn about money
We alive right now
All we do is party and get high right now
You shot, shot! I'm a take another shot
Get a check when I party, so the money donâ€™t stop
Girl, you want me, just watch, you gonna love it on top
(Tap, tap!) Man I did homie, like pow!
I'm a need y'all to turn the fuck up, now!
I'm a need y'all to roll a blunt up, now!
I'm a need y'all to fill yo cup up, now!
Now I'm a need y'all to wild out, get down!
Do it again, lost my mind, I'm a lose it again
Girl so fine, need you and a friend
Gotta carry that light 'til the movement begin
Like action

[Hook: x2]
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I spent today [x4]
Gonna sell everything I spent today
Let's start the party with the money out the way
Make yo money stack

[Verse 2:]
Hangin' like apostrophes you can quote me
Then throw the cake in yo face like Steve Aoki
We go hard in the paint cause she need to know me
Her body insane, man, she provoke me, like pow!
I'm a need y'all to turn the fuck up, now!
I'm a need y'all to roll a blunt up, now!
I'm a need y'all to fill yo cups up, now!
Now I'm a need y'all to wild out, get down (you know!)
Keep it on the low, you a jump on girl, no geronimo
At my condo you know how it go
On the bed, on the couch and on the floor
On the floor, on the floor, on the floor, get on the floor
Don't step nigga back, that's all I know
Don't step nigga back, throwin' all my dough
Squat!

[Hook: x2]
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I spent today [x4]
Gonna sell everything I spent today
Let's start the party with the money out the way
Make yo money stack [x2]
