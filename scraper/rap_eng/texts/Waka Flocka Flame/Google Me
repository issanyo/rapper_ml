[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm fresher than a baby's ass, trying to get that baby cash
Two deep in the coop, just me and Chaz
All I see, think, and dream about is cash, never, ever had cash
What I rap for is cash
Let's get money, nigga
Signed to So Icey, no swer, Flocka 'bout his cash
Jim Carrey chain on, my charm green as the Mask
1017, you can call that shit Brick Squad
4-9 and 37, you can call that shit Hit Squad
Slow down, I'm going out of breath, Flocka going hard
Thinking smart, making new friends, keep my hands in
I'm about a dollar and I got no fucking sense
I need a big ass house with a white picket fence

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]

Google me, google me
I ain't never been a scared nigga
Google me, google me
I held it down in jail, nigga
Google me, google me
I'ma always keep a tool on me

[Verse 2: Cartel MGM]
Google me, google me, tell me what you find
Cocaine dealers stay cooking all the time
Whipping four-ways, babies, and nines
Murderistic mind, keep a 40 by my side
Cartel be a real Mexican goonie
Trap doing crazy numbers, call it Looney Tooney
Pussy talking shit, but now he saying nothing
Pull up to the red light, MGM dumping
Two always zooming, that's part of my wardrobe
Scared to kill a nigga? Then what you got a strap for?
If you ain't getting money, then what you live for?
Six figure playmate on my fucking cellie phone

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Google me, google me
It's gon' tell you I'm a real nigga

Google me, google me
It's gon' tell you I'm a real nigga
Google me, google me
I ain't never been a scared nigga
Google me, google me
I held it down in jail, nigga
Google me, google me
I'ma always keep a tool on me

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
Google me, nigga, pull up my resume
It's gon' tell you I do gangsta shit everyday
I swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth
So I gotta keep it a hundred when I'm in the booth
And when I'm in the streets, even in my sleep
I can go anywhere, bet they'll remember me
It's a red sky, you'd better do your homework
I had my own pistols I had my own purp
I never been a bitch, I never turned snitch
So if you disrespect me, that'll get you burned quick
I hate bitch niggas, I hang with real guys
'Cause I'm a real nigga, you better realize

Google me, google me
I'ma always keep a tool on me

[Verse 4: Kinto]
Google me, motherfucking K-I-N-T-O
Waka Flocka, So Icey, Mafia Made, cutthroat
Bald heads, tatted, up Mexicans from the A
Box chevorlet, 28's, amigo getting paid
Google me, see me, black rag and pistol
Love this gangsta shit, gutter life is what I live for
Type of nigga that'll [?], the type of nigga that'll snatch yo hoe
South Atlanta, Murder Street, in the hood, you'll find me
Forest Park, Riverdale, tool on deck, Google me
Need work, need pills, and green? Yeah, just Google me
Make money, live fast, drug life and gang fights
Might sell your grave, yeah, and kick your door the same night
