[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Blood brothers
Me and Wooh jump out, you better duck, motherfucker
Sssquaaad!

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm jugging with this tax money
10 bands, swipe, 20 bands, swipe, 30 bands, swipe
I'm jugging with this tax money
40 bands, swipe, 50 bands, swipe, 60 bands, swipe

[Interlude: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm jugging with this tax money
New car, swipe, new house, swipe, new ice, swipe
I'm jugging with this tax money
They think it's rap money
Bounce that ass, shake that ass, make it clap for me

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Hundred bottles in the club, this the life
Fuck the price, nigga
Swipe, nigga
White collar crimes, all I see is dollar signs
Getting money on my grind, bitch I'm in my prime
If I get caught, sit back and do the time (Squad)
These judges don't really hold no weight
Got it in my mind, death before dishonor
Fuck the jury and your honor
Shawty, I got [?]
With 3 friends, one got 2 kids, the other got 3
The other got no kids, that's 65 hundred
5 states in 85 hundred (Squad)

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame] (2x)

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
50 bands, you can swipe it to my bank card
Lot of dead guys, bank account a graveyard
Keep money coming back like a bungee chord
Wooh Da swimming through the money, fuck a lifeguard
I'm swimming through your chick, call me Michael Phelps
Whole lot of ice, that'll make them bitches melt
A lot of smoke, can't breathe, think I need some help
Swag A-1, double G's on my belt
No matter the price, I just tell em swipe
Waka Flocka, Wooh Da King, known to get 'em hype
I'm just jugging with this tax money, tell 'em swipe
OZ of O.G., and a cup of Sprite

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame] (2x)
