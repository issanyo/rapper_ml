[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah
Yeah
I don't trust nobody
No
I don't trust nobody
Uh, go

[Hook: Quavo]
Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches
I don't trust nobody (x4)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I do not trust these women
I'm gripping the strap when I'm pissing
I know that she fucking and sucking the squad, you know I'm not kissing
You be the witness
My wrist a tornado, that's a migo fitness
We mean the bidness, shout out to DJ Victoriouz, Longway he be cripping
LA fitness, on the treadmill chasing Benjamins
Got a thousand in your pocket, must be kidding me
I'm taking the trips out to Italy
I finger fuck the pot literally
Take a look at me nigga, remember me
I'm taking trips out to California and you know that I'm shopping in Beverly

[Hook: Quavo]
Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
All I smoke is gas bags, just AK's and red flags
Made white girls love dreadlocks
Phantom Ghost from a hotbox
My lil niggas don't need much, all they catch is bodies
Didn't forget about it
Hop out, make all the profit

[Verse 3: Offset]
Hop out, make all the profit
Bomb in my left pocket, right pocket rocket
She give me sloppy toppy and I'm cocky
The block is so hot like a bag of tackies
Come to the north, it's a migo community
We go by unity, now we on MTV
You gon' notice me, check your boy Louie V
I'm dragging my Louboutin, fuck it, the mud on me

[Hook: Quavo]
Running 'round the lobby, fucking with the bitches
I keep the extension, cause I don't trust these women
Geeking off a Scotty, running 'round the lobby
I don't trust nobody, I don't trust nobody
I'll let you be the witness
Young nigga strapped with extensions
I don't trust these niggas, I do not trust these bitches
I don't trust nobody (x4)
