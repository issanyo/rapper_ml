My don says we gone be rich one day
Lay it down, don't say a sound, gunplay!
This for my niggas on the block and hallways
Ball every Monday through Sunday, rollin'!

[Chorus: Gunplay & Waka Flocka Flame]
Every time you see me on the set boy, I'm rollin'
Rims, whips sittin' on them shits boy, I'm rollin'
Snatch a dime nigga wanna rip 'cause, I'm rollin'!
Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'! Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'!
My VIPs trump tight, all I see is Ace of Spades
5% tint, behind these all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine Js
If you love yo city like me, rep where you stay

[Verse 1: Gunplay]
My campaigns in champagne can't slow down my fast lane
I do my damn thing I'm drunk on that kerosene
Got birds I'm the batman, pussy by the caravan
It's fake? I ain't wearing that. My cake? White as Mayonnaise
My chopsticks are foldout, the drum holds a whole lot
Just buss me a lick I had to bond my "lil'woe" out
Tore down that pussy (yep), left the walls wore out
A Dade County nigga twist the fro, and let it grow out
I pop bands and count that, can't turn down my loud pack
You keep it real in the field? Homeboy I doubt that
Think you finna bring it here? think twice we bout that
You ride with me? Shout that. Besides you ain't bout that

[Chorus: Gunplay & Waka Flocka Flame]
Every time you see me on the set boy, I'm rollin'
Rims, whips sittin' on them shits boy, I'm rollin'
Snatch a dime nigga wanna rip 'cause, I'm rollin'!
Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'! Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'!
My VIPs trump tight, all I see is Ace of Spades
5% tint, behind these all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine Js
If you love yo city like me, rep where you stay

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka]
I'm drinking ace of spades like a pop soda
Man, I'm balling out rapping, I'ma stock holder (Flocka!)
Clay Co love me like Brooklyn love Hova
Forest Green rover, call it Tarzan
Hell yeah I'm sleepwalking boy get off them Xans
100 grand in my pockets, watch me do the money dance
I'm finna change my name to Benjamin Flocka
Lord forgive me for my sins, I just killed the beat
Ostrich on the seats, pineapple paint, bottles on me
What you want to drink?
Pills on me, who want the heat?
Steal two, I'ma Fucking G! Rollin'!

[Chorus: Gunplay & Waka Flocka Flame]
Every time you see me on the set boy, I'm rollin'
Rims, whips sittin' on them shits boy, I'm rollin'
Snatch a dime nigga wanna rip 'cause, I'm rollin'!
Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'! Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'!
My VIPs trump tight, all I see is Ace of Spades
5% tint, behind these all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine Js
If you love yo city like me, rep where you stay

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Gun on my waist, bun in my lace
Sittin' all level, squatting on a santé
Suckers getting sautéed, for getting all brave
Buyer and supplier, it take's 2 to rob base
'Cause the tape on the town, the money on the carpet
Fish scale looking like I peel't it off a topping
From white sea to water, that shit get to walking
One question in that room? That killer get to talking
These hoes like a ball man, these hoes just for tossing
These chains, these rings, these things, I'm flossin'
8s for spillin', bananas for peeling
Her mouth? For fun. Her knees? For kneelin'
Rollin'!

[Chorus: Gunplay & Waka Flocka Flame]
Every time you see me on the set boy, I'm rollin'
Rims, whips sittin' on them shits boy, I'm rollin'
Snatch a dime nigga wanna rip 'cause, I'm rollin'!
Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'! Nigga, 'cause I'm rollin'!
My VIPs trump tight, all I see is Ace of Spades
5% tint, behind these all black shades
A young nigga paid, number nine Js
If you love yo city like me, rep where you stay
