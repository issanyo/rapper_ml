Brother's keeper, yes I am

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Drop some money on your head you touch my motherfuckin' brother
Off top your pussy ass, pistol whoop your baby mother
[?] dread head Danny Glover
I'm the shooters type of shooter, sellin' slabs of butter
One time for my trap niggas, two time for my gunners
From Clayton County Riverdale [?]
Three time for these fuck niggas, four time for these lames
Five time for the hood, I swear to god  we not the same
I'm Flocka Flame, they know my name
I'm off the chain, I bust your brain
I hit your block and go insane for my motherfuckin' blood brothers
I ride for my niggas, I die for my niggas
I sit back through time, twenty five for my niggas

[Verse 2: Wooh Da Kid]
Hittin' licks, split the sack with my brother
If I ain't have enough then I'm bound to hit another
You niggas is scary, that's word to my mother
I swear that you pussy and she under cover
No matter the issue, for all my brothers I'm poppin' pistol
I'm raising my whistle
I'm toting the tech, my aim is official
Fuck any nigga that's with you
You niggas got problems, [?] against you
[?]
[?] covered in ice like a igloo
These niggas keep lyin', they losing their mind
They droppin' them dimes, [?]
Thought y'all when y'all did the crime
But he just came home and you just got nine
That nigga's a leech, he a blood sucker
Wooh Da Kid, Waka Flocka, that's my blood brother
BSM [?] sittin' on some mils
And I don't talk it out cause I ain't Dr. Phil
