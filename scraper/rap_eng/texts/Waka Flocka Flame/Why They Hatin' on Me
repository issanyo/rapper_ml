[Intro]
Flocka, Waka
Why they hating on me, hating on me?
Why they hating on me, hating on me?
Nah, why they hating on me?
Why they hating on me?
Why they hating on me?

[Chorus]
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me

[Verse 1]
I put on for Clayco, diamonds like a bagel
Brown and black putting on, we about them pesos
Them boys in blue, yeah, Cheeto gang, I can't fuck with them
Rap beef cheesy, Waka Flocka Eazy
Me, I'm a G like shawty from Bompton
Piru bumping, what's [?] YG Hootie-hoo?
The way I swag, the way I write, you can call that shit a felony
The way I aim, the way I shoot, you can call that shit a murder, B
Waka, Flocka, Flame
That nigga bump that, nigga bump that, young nigga off the chain
Su woo to my Bloods, all the down south gangs
Stay the fuck out my lane and tell 12 to do the same

[Chorus]
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me

[Verse 2]
Brick Squad USA, I put that on my mama
Who I'm down with, what I claim, shawty? So Icey ENT, no swag
All black mask with a fucking red rag (Brick Squad)
Tell OG stock it, when I get it, you got it
That "shoot them up killer" shit, shawty, I'm 'bout it
Lame shit outed, Brick Squad outfit
Brick Squad shoes, Brick Squad zoos
Brick Squad this, Brick Squad that
Hold a Brick Squad hat with the Brick Squad beater
I'm flexing, high like George Jetson
Waka Flocka Flame, you can call me next, man

[Chorus]
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me

[Verse 3]
What's the fuss all about? Here's Waka Flame
My generation, you can call it off the chain
Cocaine, X pills, and some Mary Jane
Whole hood down to ride, yes, we gangbang
Red rags, throw it up, motherfucker
Black rags, throw it up, motherfucker
Blue rags, throw it up, motherfucker
Yellow rags, throw it up, motherfucker
Throw it up, shawty, nigga, what hood you from?
Have you ever sold dope and ran with a gun?
Mentally like the summer of Sam
Waka Flocka Flame, all I got is grams

[Chorus]
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me
I got a new chain, now they hating on me
I bought a new watch, now they hating on me
I got a new car, now they hating on me
I signed a record deal, now they hating on me
