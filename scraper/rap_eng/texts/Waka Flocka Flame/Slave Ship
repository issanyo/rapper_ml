[Hook: Azizi Gibson]
New white bitch in a whip that's my slave ship
Low-rider clean, new paint, we gon' bang bitch
Cup full of crumbs, you don't know you a lame bitch
Bud in the club, boy we ain't on the same shit
All my niggas gon' ride (ah ah ah ah)
All my niggas get high (ah ah ah ah)
All my niggas gon' ride (ah ah ah ah)
All my niggas get high (ah ah ah ah)

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
Now that don't make no sense, that don't make no sense
Cause if it don't pay the rent, the indo pay the rent
And I'm not on the fence, I'm just real as shit
Boy I got mouths to feed, I don't chase these tricks
Unlike you, I'm always on the motherfucking grind
Sow my own wounds up, fuck a doctor's note, Iâ€™m fine
Would be all in the cut trynna hustle us some dimes
Twelve noon, give a fuck, I'mma drink till I die
Now sing a song for me, a song for me
While we get lit on the canopy, the canopy
Haters be like no it cannot be, it cannot be
Where'd that boy get all this energy
Bitch please, don't be tryna ride my D!

[Verse 2: Azizi Gibson]
Now that don't make no sense, that don't make no sense (Nope! Still don't!)
Boy you need to take the bench, you need to take the bench
(Yo! Sit yo' fucking ass down!)
Cause bitch we on a roll, and you 'bout to break this shit (Whew! Ah, told ya!)
Cause ballin' ain't your sport, we'll take the rest from here
We never givin' up, we gotta live it up
This shit is tough, we won't ever get enough
That's just niggas bruh, always aimin' up
Swear they be framin' us, degradin' us, lame as fuck
I don't even wanna say this much, spark your J [?] bruh
Engage with us, bang with us, hang with us, slang with us
Before the government gets rid of us

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka]
I just popped a molly, codeine in my body
Double parked the Rolls, jumped up in the 'Rari
They call me Waka Flocka, I'm from Clayton County
Shooters all around me, make me place a bounty
I don't wanna know who's snitchin', I could give a fuck who real
I just wanna count money, smoke weed in my [?]
Catch me at my show, white girls all around me
Moisture, moisture, moisture, goddamn they might drown me
Flocka!
