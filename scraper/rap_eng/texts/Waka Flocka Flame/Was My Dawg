Dawg, fuck the game, never tuck in my chain
Never fuck with you lames, shit'll never be the same
Dawg, fuck the game, never tuck in my chain

When yo' ass got locked up, you turned on the fam first
Always takin' fuckin' credit, never put in no work
Used my name for leverage, before they front you, they gon' call first
Big dawg Flocka really gripping on the chopper
Had a young boy hit your head for a plate of shrimp and lobster
Flocka Curry, Flocka Curry, shoot yo' ass just like a three
Flocka Curry, Flocka Curry, twenty mil with no degree

Shoot the fair one with a nigga, beat yo' ass just like a kid

You, my nigga

Pistol in your face, before I do it say I love ya (for real)
Damn you like a G, spray your house up like Febreze, nigga
Fuck your party invites nigga, you know I don't fuck with ya
You know I ain't hangin' with ya, you know we ain't bool nigga
Knock you out like Scoob nigga, I don't play by rules nigga
Real or you're fake, shawty, you gon' have to choose nigga
Put you round them roofs when them G's was on yo' ass

How you think your ass gon' last without big dawg in your corner?
How you think yo' ass gon' last when them choppers pull up on ya? (pussy)
