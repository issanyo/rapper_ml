[Intro:]
If you got a lighter, put your lighter in the air right now
Put your cell phones in the air
Flame

[Chorus:]
One time, put your lighters in the air
Two time, put your lighters in the air
Three time, put your lighters in the air
Four time, put your lighters in the air
Five time, put your lighters in the air
Six time, put your lighters in the air
Doing it for the one, that they make it in here
Doing it for the one, that they make it this year
All up, put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air

[Verse 1:]
All I wanna do is just smoke
Lighters in the air, put your lighters in the air
Put your lighters in the air
All I wanna do is just smoke
Put your lighters in the air [x3]
Doing it for the one, that they make it in here
Doing it for the one, that they make it this year

[Verse 2:]
Light a big Glock put your lighter in the air
Lighter in the air, I’m the fighter of the year
In the middle of the ring, Mike Tyson in here
See a whole lotta rappers, that be biting my ear
It’s my whole sway, you can’t have that
I’m like God please, bring the jag back
Momma look at me, like where your ear at
See am on the cheese, where the bread at
Where the spread at, I beat that
I stay deaf and I cheat that
Looking at the crowd, see some real friends
It’s a day one phase, all to take it all in
Cause we ain’t never made plans
And I don’t know you homie
Why you wanna shake hands
Ever had somebody take your things
Make you can’t do it, Police on
We gonna mow the fucking through it
Remember late nights talking in my own room
Teacher shitting on me in my own room
Never hit the mike with my own news
Couldn’t even get a dugs to the fast food
Open flame burger, more bathroom now
That’s fresh food coming from a fresh dude
Waka, flocka

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Doing it for the one, that they make it in here
Doing it for the one, that they make it this year
