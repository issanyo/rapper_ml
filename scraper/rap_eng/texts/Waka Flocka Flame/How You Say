[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame & Sizzle]
AR-15, cooling kit
FN-N filled with lead tips
In between your eyebrows, got big MACs for small fries
Walk up on that pussy nigga (2x)
This car's not a lender, swear I'm blessed but still a sinner
Said that was your main bitch, I'm putting dick all in her dentals
I been getting to the money, stashing...

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
Okay
So they wanna know what's really going on with me and Guwop
What the fuck you think going?
Nothing
Let my lil bruh talk to y'all niggas man
You jump stupid then I'm sending Chaz

[Verse 1: Sizzle]
I said this car's not a lender, swear I'm blessed but still a sinner
Said that was your main bitch, I'm putting dick all in her dentals
I been getting to the money, stashing midget in a rental
Shit I'm still the same shooter with a million dollar mental
And we not the same nigga, you ain't been through what I been through
Got a choppa with a beam, this bitch here will turn you Hindu

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
In between your eyebrows, got big MACs for small fries
Walk up on that pussy nigga, we don't do no drive-bys
On West Boast with Hyetopp, you cross that, see Allah
Got work in? Que pasa? (2x)
Whole hood, they gangbanging, walk up on a nigga if his chain swanging

[Verse 3: Sizzle]
Bitch I'm at them pockets 'cause your name ranging
Signed a deal and now we game changing
Rich now, I'm tryna maintain
Big dog, I'ma Great Dane it
Me and my Coupe head to I-80
Up now, know you niggas hate it
Same nigga but I'm underrated
Old nigga, yeah you outdated
Ate good, had to three-plate it (2x)
Niggas talking shit, then choppas sear
Bitch, I wanna run another year
Neck and wrist and lenses water clear
Bought a Coupe and now I want a [Leer?]
Try the clique and it's another tear (2x)
Pour the mud up like I'm Uncle [?]

[Verse 4: Waka Flocka Flame]
Try the blique, that's another tear, Nightmare Gang, we ain't ever care (2x)
AR-15, cooling kit
FN-N filled with lead tips
Run up on him, start shooting shit
No losses on this stupid shit
Still balling my Cuban shit
Big diamonds rings, no championship
Prince with me, he shooting shit
Inky with me, he shooting shit
We ain't ever on goofy shit, run up on a nigga, start drumming shit (2x)
Big bullets kill a elephant
My bitch's shoe the Fifth Element
Bought a house and it was elegant
Popped a Xanny, different element
Shooting at 'em for the hell of it (2x)
Y'all know how Brick Squad rocking
In the trap, birds Waka Flocking
Money stacking taller than a mountain
Got her pussy running like a fountain

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
How you say you Muslim but your charm say you Christian?
Yuh (4x) Flocka!
How you say you in the hood? Your dawgs say you missing
Yuh (4x)
Quarter million dollar, bitch you know I'ma whip it
Whip (4x)
Wipe that bambino, boy you know we caught him slipping

[Verse 5: Sizzle]
One watch, that's your whole life
Real dog, talking big bite
Told momma I'ma get these millions, I just need for y'all to hold tight
Real Fonk, talking so right
Thug city, love any type
I been geeking off the perc and molly, baby you should come and take a Sizzle flight
Checks in, nigga, greenlight
Flying past 'em, talking speed light
Drive-bys on a speed bike
Still geeking, I ain't seeing right
Molly got a nigga feeling right
Backwoods, smoke 'em every night
Swear I'm rich like I hit a heist
Still balling, fuck your petty price
Same nigga in the new whip with the same bitch, I'm the mob boss
Niggas falling like the summer leaves, I done fucked around and cut the fall on
Say you wanna ball like me, my nigga, you been hooping shawty but your ball gone

[Verse 6: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm a rooster, no Foghorn
I'ma sell it 'til it's all gone

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
How you say you Muslim but your charm say you Christian?
Yuh (4x) Flocka!
How you say you in the hood? Your dawgs say you missing
Yuh (4x)
Quarter million dollar, bitch you know I'ma whip it
Whip (4x)
Wipe that bambino, boy you know we caught him slipping
