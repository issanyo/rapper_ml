[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O. Green]
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
At the 'xaco, nigga, trying to move this indo, nigga
Pull a kickdoor, nigga, run up in your shit, my nigga
One-on-one, what? Pussy nigga, eat this trigger
Rapping ten-plus years like my name was Flocka Jigga
Down with Brick Squad, so I gotta keep it real
What's the golden rule? "Don't be scared to kill"
Off a half a pill, mouth be worth a whole mill
We ready, but the nigga ain't Archie
D.O.A., Waka Flocka Flame, might buy the Homi
Dead bodies by me, tell my mommy I said sorry
Taliban-style, got my head wrapped like a mummy
Dead bodies everywhere, looking like a tsunami

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O. Green]
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?

[Verse 2: Lil Capp]
Grove Street veteran, I'm up in here
Get out of line and get wet like swim dip
Capp the President, Waka Flocka Flame
T.O. Green, we all in the same gang
Green flag, green cash, this a green gang
Hit Squad Taliban what my team claim
Southside Atlanta is where my team hang
If you ain't cool with us, then your team lame
Fifty niggas, fifty triggers and we all busting
Have you knock the window, shooting, y'all ducking
You ain't gangsta, pussy nigga, nah, you ain't thugging
Hold up, cool out with all that mean mugging

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O. Green]
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?

[Verse 3: T.O. Green]
Green floors, green walls, I got green rooms
Green cash, green flags, I got green goons
You ain't getting real money like Green do
And you don't get the green like Green do
Word on the street is that I'm still that nigga
My nigga on green smoke your ass like a swisher
Don't nobody really know who killed that nigga
Feds follow when the kid liked them on Twitter
AR-15, the clip hold fifty, nigga
My aim stupid, I could squeeze and kill fifty niggas
My boys in the hood like Doughboy and Ricky, nigga
Try to run and bust you in your back like Ricky, nigga

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame & T.O. Green]
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
Everything green, every-everything grinchy
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?
These niggas know I'm gangsta, smoke nothing but gangsta
Roll with nothing but gangstas, oh nigga, think you gangsta?
