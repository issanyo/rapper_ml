I love money and she love me back
Money in my stomach got me lookin' like I'm fat
Throwin' my ass cap, watchin' strippers bring me stacks
I got a whole lotta this, got a whole lotta that
Got me feelin like I'm cap, why these rap whack?
I get money good, got them girls fuckin with me
Pink Panther chain screamin out where is Nikki
Autograph my CD, catch me on TV

Clap clap clap for my money
Clap clap clap if you count money
Clap clap clap throw some money
Slap her in the booty, with some money
(Flocka Waka Flocka Waka)

Clap clap clap for my money
Clap clap clap if you count money
Clap clap clap throw some money
Slap her in the booty, with some money

Pink Panther chain, you can call me walkin' lean
Watch codeine, bracelet promethazine
Rollin up them beans, cold Shawty clean
Diamonds on my rappin jeans, I call em record deals
I'm a shiny ass rolemodel, 20k for Remy bottles
That's that white clear shit, I don't fear shit (MONOPOLY)
I'm my CEO shit (MONOPOLY)
I'm a artist with a artist, and his single hard as mine, that's real shit

Clap clap clap for my money
Clap clap clap if you count money
Clap clap clap throw some money
Slap her in the booty, with some money

You ride big rims, I ride factories
At my concerts girls be chasin' after me
I swear they be attackin' me, hoetel pornography
I got to be so brick squad monopoly
Invest back in my company, ain't no breakin' me
I can fit a hundred thousand dollars in these Dickies
The number 1 one song in the world fuckin' with me
I'm a smoke 3 thousand bells of load this year
WAKA FLOCKA FLAME!

Clap clap clap for my money
Clap clap clap if you count money
Clap clap clap throw some money
