I need da baddest bitch

Wit da fattest ass

I need da fasted whip

Wit da biggest rims

I need da loudest kush

I need da brightest ice

These niggas ain't half as nice

Bricksquad, you gon lose ya life

I can't take it noo mooore loord tell meeeee. will I make it to see thiiirttyyy?

Can I take sum partnaaa's ouut daa hoood?

They say my downfaall is I wanna take all my homies out daaa hoood

But if I turn my back on deeeem

They might go to jail or end up deaaaad
