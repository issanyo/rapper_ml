[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm a take it back in the days where rappers used to give up
They get kicked off stage if their game wasn't right
Flow wasn't tight, background wasn't right
Played with it then right now be Mike... J
Good to the hood as the A
Fuck what you say
Assault rifle bars, i'm a hit em' with a K
I don't turn down, we could do it everyday
Cross that line nigga see if I play
I'm a be a soldier anytime of the day
Blunt in the ashtray
All you bloodclots vitamin K
Yell Slim Dunk on veteran's day
That's a fallen soldier
I'd eat a rapper, spit his body parts to the New York bay
Number One song's good what hoes say?
Know they envy me, my enemies give me energy
I'm in my zone, thats 2-3
I'm not the same person I used to be
Till' I D-I-E I'm going H-A-R-D
You're going to need a navy or army
I'm a juggernaut, you can't stop me
I'm the reason why yo trap hot
I changed the sound of Hip-Hop
