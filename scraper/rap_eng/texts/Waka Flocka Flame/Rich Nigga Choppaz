[Chorus:]
Flocka!

I’m too flocka, get shot down by rich nigga choppas
What you mean?
Put the word out that my youngins gon' drop you (Squad!)
My whole team, Bricksquad monopoly, ain’t no stopping us
What you mean? Fuck with me you gon' need a doctor (Piru!)
911 it’s a emergency
Got his mamma crying, hope he make it through that surgery
911 it’s a emergency
Got his mamma crying, hope he make it through that surgery

[Verse 1:]
I told you Tony, don’t you fucking cross me man
You fucking cocka(roach), I told you man
What the fuck was you thinking man?

.223's in a brand new yoppa
Chop a nigga shit like Boraco
Should never tried Waka Flocka
Shoot like a point guard, hands like a boxer
Nigga you don’t want these problems
Keep a big strap, got kick? no problem
(???) Shells, and they stuff em like pasta
And I don’t give two fucks bout a copper
Road driveby, I run down on cops
Better duck, don’t know when they gonna stop
My youngins they brazen, you know how [?]
911 it’s a mother fucking emergency
Imma be a rich Piru til they murder me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
See, mane, this will never fucking happen mane
If you never turned your back mane
See, you never turn your fucking back on family mane
What the fuck you doing cocka(Roach)?
Imma a G you see, see, everything I do man
Kick shit like Lu Kang, pull up in a Mustang
Street nigga flocka, handle business with no suit Mane
All I got to do is put the word out and your food man
I don’t play no fucking games, green lightin everything
Good on the west coast, all my niggas gang bang
Good in the midwest, all my niggas grimy man
Good on Riverdale, south Atlanta is fucking gangster

[Chorus]
