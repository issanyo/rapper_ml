[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Parking lot, V.I.P., murder
Go and get your boss, I can't talk to no worker
Two guns up, two guns up
Two guns up, two guns up
I'm already drunk, I'm already rolling
I'm too turnt' up, New Port caught my rims stolen
Shitting on my haters, you can call me colon
Me and Wooh Da Kid, leg dropping like Hulk Hogan
Tell me what you drinking, tell me what you smoking
Bad yellow bitches on the stage and they snorting
I'm a party fucking animal, blood brothers
On a different pedastool, I be doing numbers

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up

[Verse 2: Ice Burgandy]
Two young's up, we the new guns up
Got my jewels done up, I'm with my crew, run up
I be gripping the Glock's, we be ripping them shots
I'm a pimp to the top, you gon' flip then you're flop
Red flag, red drop, red bitch, red top
Fake tits and shots, she tryna' fuck with a boss
She know my watch and chain murder
Assassinate, my name murder
Two guns up if you fucking with my blood brothers

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
Parking lot, V.I.P., murder
Go and get your boss, I can't talk to no worker
Two guns up, two guns up
Two guns up, two guns up
Squad

[Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid]
Two guns up, both clips in
Aim on point, I hit you and your friend
New F.N., it'll knock off a limb
Won't thirty-eight me, this not Kobe and Lin
Black diamonds, they banging on a white door
I'm shining, Wooh Da King a light show
All we do is win, what you think I'm hype for?
D.C. snipe, aiming with my rifle

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I be gripping them Glock's, my niggas they don't give a fuck
I'm like two guns up, two guns up, two guns up, got two guns up
