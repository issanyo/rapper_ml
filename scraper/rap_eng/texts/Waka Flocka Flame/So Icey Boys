[Hook: Lil Meta]
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice

[Verse 1: Lil Meta]
M E T A, up and down the freeway
Rozay got me spinning like a DJ
FEMA market shopping, y’all on that eBay
Hit the club every night like my life a replay
Replaying these hoes, slamming candy paint doors
Aquafina kush, Aquafina foes
Sold out shows, you already know
So Icey Entertainment, taking over the globe
Whipping over the stove, fishscale dope
A1 yola, Peruvian powder
Baking soda, I know you smell the odor
In a Toyota, ’94 Corolla
Trafficking the work, got my pockets getting swoller
We move it by the boulder, I-20 roller
On our way to Body Tap, to hit the stage
So Icey Entertainment, make the trap AYE!

[Hook: Lil Meta]
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice


[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Rockman on the track, you can call me the Glockman
12 ran in my trap, you can call that hot, man
They took my Christmas trees, now I can’t buy presents
Ran up in his house with a 357
On that ski mask, that’s a 187
With a one-way ticket, first class straight to Heaven
Have a Merry Christmas, or have a Merry X-mas
Who on your wish list? Waka Flocka Flame, bitch

[Verse 3: Frenchie]
I’ve been balling ever since, watch my money stack
I got dead guys, same color as the Grinch
So Icey the best, all I want for Christmas
Is a thick bitch or a chopper in a vest
Stop sleeping, get a quilt, I’m in all red like Santa Claus
I’m the man, of course, you’re soft like cookies in the milk
Don’t even explain, dear, I’m in a private jet
Flying through the clouds like Rudolph the Reindeer

[Hook: Lil Meta]
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice
We the So Icey Boys and all of us Grinches
Lil Meta, Waka, can’t forget Frenchie
Can’t forget Wooh, free my nigga Gucc
Can’t forget Money and OJ da Juice

[Outro: Lil Meta]
Zone 6, ah
Zone 6, ah
Ah, ah
So Icey Grinch
