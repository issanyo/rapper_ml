U ain't bout that life
Everything that growl ain't dog O.U.T. over reggie never turn my back on y'all
U ain't bout that life
Just because his body full of ink, tattoos in his face I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life
You ain't never get it out the streets
Dip and doge the police, real nigga 'til I rest in peace
U ain't bout that life
Just because he rob, hit licks, got shot, and locked up, I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life

He flexin', he flexin'
He ain't never flip a brick, flip a pound
He don't know how that choppa really kick
He ain't never lose a dog, that pussy nigga innocent
He ain't have to rap in 30 towns just to kill the weed sent (sentence)
Them tattoos and that jewelry don't make you hard
And them coupe's u rap about ain't in your car garage
You fake as hell, fake as shit, counterfeit!
You a fart under pressure, tell quicker than your broad
Type to hit your hood with a bodyguard
They so not squad, young'uns, they will pull your card
U ain't bout that life
I could tell same nigga on the streets, in jail but

U ain't bout that life
Everything that growl ain't a dog O.U.T.Over reggie these never turn my back on y'all
U ain't bout that life
O just because his body full of ink, tattoos in his face I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life
You ain't never get it out the streets
Dip and doge the police, real nigga 'til I rest in peace
U ain't bout that life
Just because he rob, hit licks, got shot, and locked up, I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life

Big ball and no bite, big mouth and no fight
Flip this motherfucker fo' that bitch fine
No matter but he ain't right
Earned my G stripes as I'm livin'
I'm a robbin' it
Hell when Chelsea needs slap automo
I'm with your friend Lucas
He ain't 'bout that life, he ain't 'bout that life
We know the boy gets talkin'
200 hundred rounds in your project
At that same store barkin'
I told what the fuck? They said Diddy is fucked
Then all that false clappin', that gang bangin', throwin' the wrong sets up
Manicurin' their nails and their toes
2020, get his... in his faces
I'm 'bout that life, Yodi
I'm a thin it like a Tobe
The brick squad and the Dante Marv
Who the fuck it?

U ain't bout that life
Everything that growl ain't a dog O.U.T.Over reggie these never turn my back on y'all
U ain't bout that life
Just because his body full of ink, tattoos in his face I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life
You ain't never get it out the streets
Dip and doge the police, real nigga 'til I rest in peace
U ain't bout that life
Just because he rob, hit licks, got shot, and locked up, I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life

You ain't 'bout that life, You ain't got no stripes
You talk that tuff shit but you ain't tryna fight
Let this nigga tell it all his life, he's so white
Aks somebody 'bout him in his hood it's all lies
Talkin' 'bout you got prize, you work at Popeye's
Ain't never sell no work, he was too scared to go outside
Get up in that booth and he Tony Montana
Ain't got a hundred grand, clamin' you king of Atlanta
You ain't 'bout that life, them guns you got ain't been shot
Virgins, don't let them hoes' get you when you're splurgin'
You ain't 'bout that life ho, say sittin on bricks
I can tell how you talk, you ain't sittin on shit

U ain't bout that life
Everything that growl ain't a dog O.U.T.Over reggie these never turn my back on y'all
U ain't bout that life
Just because his body full of ink, tattoos in his face I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life
You ain't never get it out the streets
Dip and doge the police, real nigga 'til I rest in peace
U ain't bout that life
Just because he rob, hit licks, got shot, and locked up, I can still tell that
U ain't bout that life
