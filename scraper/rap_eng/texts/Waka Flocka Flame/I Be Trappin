[Intro:2 Chainz]
Sitting in the trap 'bout to go bezerk
I take a sip of lean then i go to work
Sitting in the trap 'bout to go bezerk
I take a sip of lean then I...

[Verse 1:2 Chainz]
OK now when I was five
I went to Popeye's
My mamma said "Tit, you want some chicken and some fries?"
I said "No Ma, instead I want a brick"
And i was slangin dope by the time i turned 6
I ain't learn ABC'S
Cause i was slangin keys
No vegetables when my mamma served me peas
And no bullies jacking
Cause i was pistol packing
My whole team had free lunch cause i was trappin

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got a trap
I made a trap
Only time i don't be trappin is when i take a crap
I got a trap
I made a trap
Only time i don't be trappin is when i take a crap
I be trappin x12
These bricks ain't hard to find
They ain't no Bin Ladens

[Verse 2:Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, i could make a brick out of a lemon
I accept cash, checks, and a box of chicken
All my junkies mad cause my dope got boogers in them but
Gucci can't help it, if i see it gotta pick them
6 rings on you could call me Scottie Pippen
All my bi*ches ugly, Like Eddie Griffin
Somebody please get Waka out the kitchen
Cause im trying make this dope
And that Ni**a always tripping

[Verse 3:Waka Flocka Flame]
WAKA FLOCKA FLOCKA FLOCKA
BOOM..SHACKA LOCKA
Yes, I be trappin
Cause I damn sure don't be rapping
I be sapping, i be yapping
I be up in Chuck E Cheese
Taking tokens from the kids
'Bout to play some fu**ing games
Like, FLOCKA x20

[Verse 4:Kayne West]
CHIEF KEEF! CHIEF KEEF?
You an Indian
I pee on your tee pee
I'm looking like a black Austin Powers
You looking like some black cauliflower!
Young Dreds that's that sh*t i don't like
Mop heads that's that sh*t i don't like
Young Dreds that's that sh*t i don't like
Mop heads that's that sh*t i don't like

[2 Chainz]
These bricks ain't hard to find
They ain't no Bin Ladens!

[Verse 5:Soulja Boy]
Now i wake up in the morning
I be trappin
I be up in the morning
I be swagging
I be up and im swagging
I be jumping, and im flapping
And im rapping and im Snapping
I be swagging when im trappin
I be all the way...

[Verse 6:OJ DA Juice man]
Young Juice man and i just cam from trappin
All my songs flopped but im still rapping
When im at the ATM im getting that money
When its Easter time i be hopping like a bunny
'67 cutlass and it goy the AYE
I went to New York and they booed me off the stage
They told me go home and threw tomatoes in my face
But i still got the trap so its "AYE Okay!"
