[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I fucked my money up, now I can't re-up
Ran up in his spot just to get my stacks up
Now I'm back on deck, so shawty, what the fuck you want?
Heard he's talking shit, but this ain't what the fuck you want
Locked my CEO up, now it's back to coca
Niggas talking shit, bro, hang him by a ropa
Hit em with the chopper, call that shit hot llama
Call me Waka Flocka AKA Young Wild Nigga
AKA Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft
Stacks on the floor, watch Kebo water whipping
Shoots it to the left, then he shoots it to the right
So Icey Brick Boys got it all night
These lame-ass niggas ain't got no fight
Kick in my door, we gonna shoot it out all night
Home of the Braves, shawty, shoot 'em with AK

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it

Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
One shot, man down, his brains go "ka-pow!"
Ow, that shit hurt, so don't fuck around
But that happen often off in Riverdale, Georgia
You gonna pay the life you live off in Riverdale, Georgia
They gonna lay your ass out, rock you to sleep like a baby

Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy

And this Real Money, so we getting to it
And your bitch, she choosing
But if you ain't talking dollars, keep it moving
Catch me on the south with Flocka Flame
And we got a problem if you saying Waka's name
'Cause we off the chain, you see my green flag
You want beef? Oh let's do it 'cause you ain't bad
And this music is for the drug dealers
And this music influence thug niggas
Okay, so if you get into it

[Original Verse 3: Riverdale Shawty & Waka Flocka Flame]
You know me, nigga, I am the block
It's Riverdale and Waka Flock
We got the Glocks, whips and the knots
Even got the spots (Scurt! Scurt!) off the block
Catch me in different states, busting down bricks
Busting down bricks with that chick you fell in love with
We on that thug shit, give a fuck about love, I'm cruel, bitch
Keep my money on my mind, not you, bitch
Every day, shawty pull up in a new whip
In the trap, shawty said he need another one
Told them call up Waka, he said "What the fuck you want?"
Pull up in the dunk followed by a yellow one
So Icey, Fetti Gang, pussy keep them Tommy guns
