[Verse 1]
I be swaggin fuckin on my couple stairs, yeah
Gucci, Rollie, rings, links 벗어, yeah, yeah
Alexander something, 얼른 벗어, yeah, yeah

Living my life, rapper's life, rapper's rapper's life
You mad at me why, I think i know why
Cuz i got the shine, cuz i ride a Benz
I call it mine, come to my house
We do this at night, we do this shit every night, I call it life
I’m a go getter, ready for whatever, ready for whatever
It’s time to get the papers, still with the shit
나타날때 빛, I don’t give a shit
Young and maybe i’m rich (Mi Casa)

[Verse 2]
잠깐만, 저 사랑 노래하는 딴따라들
너 같은 여자 만나 봤나 한 번 물어봐
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 난 바빴지, 난 바빴지
난 바빴지, 매일 나만 바빴지
진실되려 해 여기서, 또 이상하게 이게 제일 튀어
또 이상하게 이런 나랑 일을 안 하지
나 혼자 산다 team shout out
진실되려 해 여기서는 잘못 뱉은 말로는 나를 쑤셔
타임머신이 있었다면 다 벌을 받고 나서 죄를 지었을 걸
내 도착지는 할리우드, 내가 찍은 영화에 까메오로 bed scene
설레발이 아니었단 걸 알게 될 때쯤엔 plz get my message
친구 땜에 들었던 음악에 우연히 성공해 버린 게 과거
축하의 말을 건네기 전까진 원래 거의 비웃지 알아
근데 난 했지, 했지 어제도, 했지 오늘도
그리고 내일도 하고 또, Imma bout to blow
Imma bout to yo, oh, why you never know

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, all of a sudden they love singing my song
You ask me if I've ever met a girl like you
1 2 3 4 5 and 6
I was busy, I was busy, I was busy
I was busy every day
Here's the truth
Strangely enough, this is the best one
Strangely enough, I do not work with you
Shout out to the "I Live Alone Team"
I stay true
If you get the words wrong, I'm picking on you
If he had a time machine, he would have committed a crime after being punished
My goal is a bed scene shot in a cameo in a Hollywood film
By the time you found out I was not in the mood, plz get my message
I used to listen to my friends and now I have been lucky enough to succeed in my music
You passed on me and I stood there laughing waiting for you to congratulate me
But you did
Yesterday
You did it today
And tomorrow again
Imma bout to blow
Imma bout to yo oh
