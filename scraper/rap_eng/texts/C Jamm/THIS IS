Hangul Original
[Verse 1 : C Jamm]
전부 쉬워 말로는
누가 이제 winning brother?
난 내가 말한 대로 살어
난 말이 많아, that’s why I always prosper
이 여자한테 삘이 와
음악 작업도 이런 식이야
Ay, you from another city right
This is something new shit, can you feel me
This is something new, 두 살 어린 benzo
Let’s ride, 존나 땡겨
Balenciaga with my fashion
Meet up with my babe at Shanghai
Every month, every couple of weeks
Every night we fuck, 아까워 시간이
Every night we fuck at 강남 even at 홍대
Everytime we ball, 내 여자친구 이름 바뀌어도 얘네 다 이뻐

[Hook : C Jamm]
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know

[Verse 2 : C Jamm]
누구에게 성공은 아마 가위바위보
내 성공은 내 방식대로 내 머릿속에 다 있어
내가 헤매던 때도 난 가짜 짓은 안 했어
간지 양아치 내 태도, baby, I don’t give a fuck
Bitch, don’t kill the vibes, 부탁이 아니지
내가 미쳤다고 하는 내 여자는 할리퀸
네가 위아래하고 내가 타고 아래위
위, 위, 위, 삼키지

[Hook : C Jamm]
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know

[Verse 3 : C Jamm]
Hands up, hands up, hands up in the air
커다란 무대서 멋지게 이 대사를 치는 게
아직 꿈이기만 했던 시절 만든 1-2
그때는 형을 코드 컨스트로 알고 있던 때, 그때
처음엔 우리끼리 일을 키워보자고
얼굴도 본 적 없이 들어갔었던 첫 작업
이젠 우리 collaboration quality they know
Same, same brother, 필요 없어 페이도
I work west side 인천, you know what I mean
놀면서 급을 올리니까 안되지 부담이
느끼는 것도 많아, 많은 걸 걱정하다
털어 놓을 때 이제 적어도 그 중 돈은 없잖아
이제 세 번째, 세 번쯤 더 했을 때
하루 종일 틀어지게 되려나? uh, everywhere
외국물 먹고 온 코쿤이 아직도
C Jamm을 찾는 건 전혀 문제가 아니겠지
I’m gone baby

English Translation
[Verse 1:]
Saying it is always easy
Who’s winning now brother
I live as I say
I talk a lot so that’s why
I always prosper
I’m getting a vibe from that girl
That’s the same for music too
Ay You from another city, right?
This is something new shit

[Verse 2:]
Can you feel me?
Two years younger than me, benzo
Let’s ride, fuckin ride
Balenciaga with my fashion
Meet up with my babe
At Shanghai
Every month, every couple of weeks
Every night we fuck
Time’s a wastin'
Every night we fuck
At Gangnam, even at Hongdae, every time we ball
Even if I change the name of my girlfriend
These girls are all pretty

[Hook:]
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know

This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know

[Verse 3:]
To some, success is like rock paper scissors
My success comes from my way
It’s in my head
Even when I was lost
I never did anything fake
Kanji, delinquent, my attitude?
Baby, I don’t give a fuck
Bitch don’t kill the vibes
This isn’t a request
My girl who calls me crazy is Harley Quinn
You do the up and down
I ride from bottom up
Then you swallow

[Hook:]
This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know

This is how we do
This is how we do
This is how we do
Now you know
Now you know

[Verse 4:]
Hands up hands up hands up in the air
On a big stage, saying these words
Felt like a dream in 1-2
Back then, I knew you as just Code Kunst
At first, we tried to make more work
Started working together without even meeting
Now we have collaboration quality they know
Same same brother, don’t even need pay

[Verse 5:]
I work west side Incheon
You know what I mean
I raise my level as I pray so there’s no pressure
I feel a lot of things, I worry a lot
But when I talk about my worries
Money isn’t part of it at least
Now when I do the third part, three more times
All day, it’ll be missed everywhere
CoKun drank some foreign water and came back
But he still looks for C Jamm
It’s not a problem
I’m gone baby
