[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
I see you looking at my body
Your eyes say you love what you looking at
I feel you touching on my body
Your hands say you love where you touching it

[Chorus: Bunji Garlin]
Well gyal de way you move that body
Baby gyal you gonna my my money
And the way ya, way ya move that body
Aye little mami you fine
Cause I love the way you shaking shaking your bum bum
Shaking shaking shaking shaking shaking your bum bum

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Does I get it, get? I get it with ya
