[Chorus]
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Don't get tired yet, tired yet
Don't get tired yet
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Keep on doing it, doing it
Keep on doing it

[Verse 1]
Alright, alright
If you wanna get my body, better blow my mind
Okay, okay
Boy you better put in work if you wanna play
Alright, alright
I see you been looking at it all night, all night
Okay, okay
Saying that you got that game, baby, demonstrate

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you take me places I've never been
Never been before?
Give me loving 'til I just can't take it
Take it any more

[Chorus]
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Don't get tired yet, tired yet
Don't get tired yet
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Keep on doing it, doing it
Keep on doing it

[Verse 2]
Let's go, let's go
You been talking all damn night, now it's time to show
Oh me, oh my
It's burning up in here, we 'bout to start a fire
Let's go, let's go
Hope you can handle it like a pro, like a pro
Oh me, oh my
Baby you can't be scared to put in overtime

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you take me places I've never been
Never been before?
Give me loving 'til I just can't take it
Take it any more

[Chorus]
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Don't get tired yet, tired yet
Don't get tired yet
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Keep on doing it, doing it
Keep on doing it

[Bridge]
Keep it coming
Don't stop until the morning
Keep it coming
All or nothing
That's just the way I want it
All or nothing
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Don't get tired yet, tired yet
Don't get tired yet
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Keep on doing it, doing it
Keep on doing it
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Don't get tired yet, tired yet
Don't get tired yet
Baby break a sweat, break a sweat
Baby break a sweat
Keep on doing it, doing it
Keep on doing it

[Outro]
Woo!
Baby break a sweat
Oh, yeah!
Baby break a sweat
