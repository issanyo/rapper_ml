[Chorus]
And then you kiss me and make you fight
Oh baby we just [?] kissing goodbye
At the end of the night I'ma be thinking of how you're not mine
I just can't anymore
And at the end of the night I keep tossing and turning and then I realize it will be so hard to say goodbye
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?

[Verse 1]
We used to talk about being together forever, but now I'm here like whatever
I never [?] me folding and whipping in the kitchen until I got with ya
I miss ya, I hate ya, I love ya, I need ya
I need to just leave you alone
Oh believe me I try and try but the thought alone it makes me cry
I can't lie oh and people they see me
I wear a smile to hide my tears cause you're not here and see sometimes I think about all the "what if's" I go out to take my mind of all the pain, 'cause I can't lie it gets too hard, hard to maintain

[Chorus]
And then you kiss me and make you fight
Oh baby we just [?] kissing goodbye
At the end of the night I'ma be thinking of how you're not mine
I just can't anymore
And at the end of the night I keep tossing and turning and then I realize it will be so hard to say goodbye
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?
