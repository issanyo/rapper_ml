[Intro: will.i.am]
Alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh Okay
What do we have here
Becky G, Will.I.am
In the house
This is a problem

[Hook: Becky G]
I'm a problem, I’m a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I’m a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I’m a problem, I’m a p-problem
I'm a problem, I’m a p-problem

I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love
And I don't have to try, I just do what I does
Don't have to tell me, I already know
They all want me

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Yo, I run this, I smash it
Like my bass real hard, boom-bastic
Speed race baby, I’m a lot faster
Cause trouble, never listen to my master

New Benz all black, from Malaysia
Can't drive, but my mama don't care yup
To the top, I'm a take it to the ceiling
I'm on the moon but I feel the sun beaming

I'm so dope like ooh la la
So so fly like a helicopter
Sup to the hood and the homies on the block
Doin' it big, ya you know, what's up

Some come and try to say I'm a problem
So crazy, gotta put 'em in an asylum
Some come and try to say I'm a problem
Ha, solve it

[Hook: Becky G]
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem

I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love
And I don't have to try, I just do what I does
Don't have to tell me, I already know
They all want me

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Yo, yo, yo
You got one down, I'm on two now
There's another one, I got a few now
You know I'm a beast, I throw down
Showdown, whatcha gonna do now

Kick rocks cause you just another hater
New team, I'm an all-star player
Get at me but you better get your game up
My steez like ooh la la

I'm so fresh got this on lock
It's my time, yeah, check my watch
My mama say I'm a leader
His mama say I'm a keeper
That's too bad cause I ride solo
Do it one time then you want some more
I'm a problem, tell ya, I'm a problem

Ay, yo
I'm just tryna get it poppin'
I wanna be the first dude to love a martian
She love a man, cut the swag that I'm droppin'
I kill the game til it's chillin' in the coffin
When I start, there ain't no stoppin'

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
(Don't be acting like)
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know

[Hook: Becky G]
I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love
And I don't have to try, I just do what I does
Don't have to tell me, I already know
They all want me

I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love
And I don't have to try, I just do what I does
Don't have to tell me, I already know
They all want me

[Outro: Becky G]
I'm a problem, I'm a p-problem
