[Intro]
Ese me lo Papi

[Verse 1]
Hit me up like every night
Say you wanna have a pillow fight
But you're holding back and I don't know why
Baby, can I just be real?
Getting hot when I'm all alone
Everytime your name drops on my phone
But a picture just ain't enough
Need a little something to feel, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, all we do is talk about it
But can't we just be about it?
Show me what you're gonna do about it
Do it, do it, do it

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth and listen
Don't you know what you be missing?
I don't wanna keep talking
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Know I like that danger
But I need a game changer
Want it sooner than later
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it

[Verse 2]
We're playing games like hide and seek
Come on over, get high with me
Dame lo, aye Papi
Baby, come on, make it real, yeah
I just wanna get intimate
I know you're gonna be into it
Don't blame a girl for wanting it
Need a little something to feel, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, all we do is talk about it
But can't we just be about it?
Show me what you're gonna do about it
Do it, do it, do it
(Toca me)

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth and listen
Don't you know what you be missing?
I don't wanna keep talking
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Know I like that danger
But I need a game changer
Want it sooner than later
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it

[Bridge]
Where you at boy?
Where you at?
(Ese me lo Papi)
Where you at boy?
Come get it
Just do it
Where you at boy?
(Toca me)
Where you at?
Where you at boy?
(Muy caliente)
Come get it
Just do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, all we do is talk about it
But can't we just be about it?
Show me what you're gonna do about it
Do it, do it, do it
(Shhh)

[Chorus]
Shut your mouth and listen
Don't you know what you be missing?
I don't wanna keep talking
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Know I like that danger
But I need a game changer
Want it sooner than later
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Where you at? Come get it
Just do it
