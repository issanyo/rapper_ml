[Intro]
My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me, but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you

[Verse 1]
Talk to me, tell me, where you were (late last night)
You told me you were with your friends, hanging out (late last night)
You lying, cuz you stuttering, now where were you (late last night)
Stop lying to me, cuz you're ticking me off, t-t-ticking me off, oh

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter

[Verse 2]
I called you on your cell phone, no answer (tell me why)
So I text you, said "are you ready?", still no response (tell me why)
I took care of you, I loved you, and you played me (tell me why)
Stop lying to me about where you been
Cuz you're ticking me off, t-t-ticking me off

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter

My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me, but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you

[Verse 3]
Oh, you talking like I don't know what the business is
Like I don't know about those mistresses
Ain't the type to be checking your phone, bro
When you left it at home, though
I was thinking he won't know when
Who this number calling like you owe 'em money?
Then you look at me funny like "I don't know 'em, honey"
Oh you're slick huh? Got some kind of game do ya?
Dummy, you lucky that I don't bring this pain to ya
Papa said "don't you let these dudes play ya, B"
Repeating everything like you rapping through latency
And I ain't bout to be sitting around thinking
If you in some club drinking, am I in the boat sinking?
Homie, I'm from the hood, I've seen every type of jet move
5'2", but I'm bigger than all these wack dudes
All I need is a beat to rap to
To let 'em know that you nothing in all these facts, true
So keep on stuttering, stuttering while I'm bubbling, bubbling
And you standing there wondering, look
How you dig yourself out that grave
Trying to win me back, you don't even know how to play

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying, cuz when you're replying
You stutter, stutter, st-st-stutter, stutter

[Outro]
My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me, but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you
My dear, my dear, my dear
You do not know me, but I know you very well
Now let me tell you that I c-c-c-c-caught you
