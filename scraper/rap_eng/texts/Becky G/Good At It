[Verse 1]
Love it when you tell me I'm sexy
You love it when I look right back at it (I know)
Come and let me show you who the best be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby know I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it
Love it when you tell me I'm sexy
You love it when I look right back at it
(Back at it, looking back at it)

[Chorus]
Baby know I'm just that good at it
He love it cause I'm just that good at it
He need it cause I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it

[Verse 2]
Love it when you tell me I'm so thick (yeah)
Fronting how your friends don't know 'bout it
Love it when I get this bread quick
You can't even go a day without it (mmm)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby know I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it
Come and let me show you who the best is
The way Iâ€™m moving, mess around and get an ESPY

[Chorus]
Baby know I'm just that good at it
He love it cause I'm just that good at it
He need it cause I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it

[Bridge]
The way you want it, you got it, it comes natural to me
The way you love it, my body, it comes natural to me
So baby, love, love me, now
Just give it to me,  all you got
The way you love it, my body, it comes natural to me

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know you love the way it rain down
So tell me why the hell you playin' 'round
I ain't 'bout to be on the sidelines
Sugar, let me give you some guidelines
This is game time and we the same sign
Gave you a chance cause you ain't give me some lame line
Real G should only stand for Gentleman
Sweat falling to the ground off my Cinnamon
You never get enough of it
Out of breath but you telling me that you love it (love it)
It take a lot for me to let you in
But if you get a chance to play, you better win
No basics, no strangers
I like it better when my heart is in danger

[Chorus]
And you know...
I'm just that good at it
He love it cause I'm just that good at it
He need it cause I'm just that good at it
Baby know I'm just that good at it

[Outro]
Good, good, good
He love it cause I'm just that good at it
He need it cause I'm just that good at it
The way you want it, you got it, it comes natural to me
The way you love it, my body, it comes natural to me
So baby, love, love me, now
