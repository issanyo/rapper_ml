If everybodies gettin' one shot, I ain't missin'
Yeah uh, 15 nope, not yet
I've been waitin' for my time on deck
Two brothers, a little sister
I wish the money for my deal would come a little quicker
My daddy's workin' eighty hours a week
I love him more than I'm lovin' this beat

What up, Kanye?
I was signed once when I was I 6th grade
Now I'm spillin' out my life on this mixtape
I rushed in too anxious, it weighed me down like two anchors
The wrong label, the wrong time
Feeling like a prisoner for such a long time
I made music that I didn't love singin'
It just wasn't me, look back, what was I thinking?

I was just a kid, more than just a kid, I am still
So many headches coulda singed a deal with that bill
So I sat back, had to wait it out
I kept writing till that old track faded out
It cost money that my family didn't have
I'm just keepin' it real, I never lie to my fans

And everybody makes mistakes, it's okay
I was feelin' like Beyonce with no Jay
Lost but I kept on practisin'
I kep rappinn' even tried my hand at actressin'
And now I'm finally free
I can get to know the world
It's Becky, Becky G going get to know your girl

No hook, saved that for the radio
Jam told me kill them on that beat, so away we go
Thirty bars, one take, ten hours in the studio, one break
I'm in work mode, I got my life ahead
Whe everybody went left I went right instead
Change looks everyday like, so what?
Tell me what I can't do, I'm like, oh hush!
And my first single L.A. get it first
Power 106 did the verse without rehearse
