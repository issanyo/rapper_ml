Becky G, verse one

I like to be treated like a lady

Although sometimes I forget to act like one in bed

I like to be told poetry

In the ear at night when we do the nasty

Becky G, bridge

I like a gentleman, that is interesting

That is a good friend, but a better lover

What does a few extra years matter?

Becky G, chorus

I like them older

Those we call gentlemen

The ones who open doors and send flowers

I like the bigger ones

That I can't fit in mouth

The kisses he wants to give me

That drive me crazy


Crazy, whoa oh, oh, oh

Crazy, whoa oh, oh, oh


Bad Bunny, verse two

I’m not old but I have a bank account like one

If you want to bed, I'll bring you the breakfast

Like me, there is none, a gentleman with twenty-one

I'm with all your crazy things

You want an old man, are you sure?

I promise you a million adventures

And in bed I last longer than your last

Bad Bunny, bridge

I am active 24/7

With me, you don’t need any toys

I still have a new package

But if you like them seasoned, go with another

Becky G, chorus

I like them older

Those we call gentlemen

The ones who open doors and send flowers

I like the bigger ones

That I can't fit in mouth

The kisses he wants to give me

Crazy, whoa oh, oh, oh

Crazy, whoa oh, oh, oh

Becky G, bridge two

I do not want a child who does not know anything

I prefer a guy who has size

I do not want a child who does not know anything

I prefer a guy who has size

Becky G, chorus

I like them older

Those we call gentlemen

The ones who open doors and send flowers

I like the bigger ones

That I can't fit in mouth

The kisses he wants to give me
