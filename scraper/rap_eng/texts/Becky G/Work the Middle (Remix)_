[Chorus: Alex Aiono]
Come and meet me at the afterparty
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little, don't tell nobody
I won't tell nobody, no
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Come and meet me at the afterparty
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little, don't tell nobody
Bring your body, mama, work the middle
Just a little

[Verse: Becky G]
Es la hora que nos dejemos llevar
Que se muevan nuestros cuerpos como el mar
