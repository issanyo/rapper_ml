[Verse 1: Frankie J & Becky G]
I gave you all of me and more
But you went and threw it out the door
I did everything you asked of me
But you took my love for granted
Now you're begging me not to leave

[Chorus: Frankie J & Becky G]
If I once told you that I loved you, I now regret it
If I once told you that I loved you
I know now that I must've been crazy
If I once told you that I loved you
And that I'd give the world to hold you
If I once told you that I loved you, I will never again
Because my love is over and dead

[Verse 2: Becky G & Frankie J]
And I, I wonder when you'll realize
That you didn't even say your goodbye
I did everything you asked of me
But you took my love for granted
Now you're begging me not to leave

[Chorus: Frankie J & Becky G]
If I once told you that I loved you, I now regret it
If I once told you that I loved you
I know now that I must've been crazy
If I once told you that I loved you
And that I'd give the world to hold you
If I once told you that I loved you, I will never again
Because my love is over and dead

[Verse 3: Kap G & Frankie G]
Gave you my last, even put you in that swag
Put you on that Louis bag, I ain't even tryna brag
Everything I gave you, baby, I'mma need it back
Now you prayin' on my downfall, I ain't doin' bad
Do you remember the times I picked you up at night
Swear it hurt that I can't call you mine
I'm just at the crib sipping Corona and lime
Still in the bricks puttin' in that overtime
I still hold the throne, and she call my phone
'Cause she all alone, got no coraz√≥n
We coulda been like J-Lo and Marc Anthony
Could-coulda made a family, coulda been your majesty
I know you miss when we dancin' bachata en mi casa
But you with all that acting, you deserve an Oscar
I was ten toes down, but you ain't hold me down
Oh, now you know me now 'cause I made a hundred thou

[Chorus: & Becky G]
If I once told you that I loved you, I now regret it
If I once told you that I loved you
I know now that I must've been crazy
If I once told you that I loved you
And that I'd give the world to hold you
If I once told you that I loved you, I will never again
Because my love is over and dead

[Outro]
Rest in peace
