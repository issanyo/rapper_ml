[Intro: Aaron Fresh]
A-Fresh
Becky G, girl

[Verse 1: Becky G]
See the first snow fall to the ground
It just don't feel right when you're not around
Supposed to be the happiest time of the year
Would you say that for me?
Wrapped up in my winter coat walking down the street
Trying not to hate on every couple that I see
The only thing I got on my list is you here with me, yup

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh Ad-Lib]
I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve (oohhh)
And I got so many presents to send (ya)
Please come back to me

[Chorus: Becky G w/Aaron Fresh]
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me, yea
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
(So won't you wait for me...)

[Verse 2: Aaron Fresh]
Every other holiday I was by your side
I would give them all away to have a solid night
Supposed to be the jolliest time of the year
But it just ain't for me, no
Carolers are singing
I just wanna hold your hand
Not having you here with me is more than I can stand
On the next flight, pick me up when I land
I don't wanna be alone...

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh)
I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve
And I got so many presents to send ya
Please come back to me
I'll be coming back, Becky G

[Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me

[Bridge: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
So, hang the stocking up
Where's the mistletoe?
And when I get home
Who know where this will go?
I never wanna be alone when it's cold out
So turn the lights on, I'm on my way to your house
And we don't need a gift
You got me wrapped up
I put a bow on just to make you crack up
And we can hang all night, no phone
I need a buddy in my snow globe, shawty

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve
And I got so many presents to send ya (bring it back here, girl)
Please come back to me

[Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so just you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me (just wait for me, girl)
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
