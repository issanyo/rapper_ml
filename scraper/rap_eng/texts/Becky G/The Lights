[Intro]
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?

[Verse 1]
My heart is weighing heavy
My tank is running empty
These hours moving slowly
And my phone it don't fulfill me, oh no
Looking out these small ass windows
Another day, another city
Only angels here in the night time
Ain't nobody`s with me
I need my day one clique
On a day one sheer
Damn, I need that so bad, that's my fix

[Chorus]
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me

[Pre-Verse]
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?

[Verse 2]
Late nights, all these new fakes
I'm over all the pretend
On stage they see me wilding
Inside ain't even smiling
Some say what they gon' say
Throwing shade like it's sunny
Ain't here for the role play
Ain't here for the money
I need my day one clique
On a day one sheer
Damn, I need that so bad, that's my fix

[Chorus]
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me

[Pre-Verse]
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?

[Verse 3]
How can I feel so alone
With people around me
All day on my phone
They be asking me questions
All of my profession, the road is my home, bunk beads
Tour bus life got me feeling like
Staring blank up wiht the ceiling lights
Fans is my family, I love 'em so much
I'd be nowhere wihtout em or can be
Thought of a someone who has the ability to get this money
And fame and then still be complaining
I was never aiming for loneliness
And we take things for granted at times
But all that I want now at night
Is someone to kiss me all up on my forehead
And tell me that shit is all right

[Chorus]
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me
Blinded by the lights
Blinded by the lights
It's the only thing you see
You don't really know me

[Outro]
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?
Sometimes I feel this isn't working
Cause I'm spending all my time working
You feel me?
