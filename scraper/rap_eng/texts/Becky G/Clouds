[Chorus: Becky G & KSHMR]
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now

[Verse: Becky G]
Closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
You've had the rest but I can take you higher now
Hold your breath, the lights are getting brighter now
Take a step closer to the clouds now

I know you hear the music getting louder now
Have no fear, your heart is beating faster now
I'll take you there, closer to the clouds now
Closer to the clouds now
