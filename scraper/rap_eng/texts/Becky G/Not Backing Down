[Intro]
[?]

[Verse 1]
I'm so exposed and I feel him waching me
Each breath I'm taking
Lost in the music
Can you find me babe?
He's tryna prove it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When he moves and I back away
If you want me come and get me
And he follows

[Chorus 1]
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not backing down (oh whoah)
He's not, he's not, he's not backing down

[Verse 2]
He's so exposed and he knows I'm waching him
Each move he's making (he's making)
You're lost in the music
I'm  tryna find you babe
So scared to lose him

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I move and you back away
Are we done yet playing these games?
Only we know (oh oh)

[Chorus 3]
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
I'm not backing down (oh whoah)
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not backing down (oh whoah)

[Bridge]
Yeah, I guess we're learning the hard way
Love isn't what the cards say
It's only for people dreaming
And movies we see
And God is believing it's you and me but it's not
And it's hard, and it's good, and it's magic
But we can't be together and that is tragic
And I hate it more than I hate traffic
And thinking about you is such a habit
But I can't change the rythm of my heart
And even if I could, wouldn't know where to start
So I just keep letting you know I'm still around
Making music and hoping that you could feel the sound
Making earthquakes hoping you could feel the ground shake
When the sound fades, we just let it downplay
So this is my confession
If there's something you know
Then I hope you don't keep me guessing
Yeah, 'cause you worth walking the whole world

[Chorus 3]
We're not backing down (I'm not backing down oh whoah)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)
(I ain't backing down, backing down baby)
We're not backing down (oh whoah)
We're not, we're not, we're not backing down (oh whoah)

[Post-Chorus]
I ain't backing down, backing down baby
I ain't backing down, backing down baby
