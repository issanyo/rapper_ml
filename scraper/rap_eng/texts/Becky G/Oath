[Verse 1: Cher Lloyd]
Yo, my best friend, best friend 'til the very end
'Cause best friends, best friends don't have to pretend
You need a hand, and I'm right there right beside you
You in the dark, I'll be the bright light to guide you
'Member the times, times, times sneaking out the house
All of the times, times, times that you had your doubts
And don't forget all the trouble we got into
We got something you can't undo, do

[Pre-Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

[Verse 2: Becky G]
I know I drive you crazy, hmm, sometimes
I know I call you lazy, and that's most times
But you complete me, and that's no lie
You are my tuxedo, and I'm your bow tie
We in the car, sing, sing, singing our song
Walk in the building, tear it down, like we King Kong
And in my eyes, you can't do, do no wrong
You got a best friend sing, sing along

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & Cher Lloyd]
Laughing so damn hard
Crashed your dad's new car
All the scars we share
I promise, I swear

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

[Bridge: Cher Lloyd]
Oh, I'll never let you go
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Oh, just thought that you should know
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
Yeah

[Chorus: Cher Lloyd]
Wherever you go, just always remember
That you got a home for now and forever
And if you get low, just call me whenever
This is my oath to you
Wherever you go, just always remember
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
And we'll never change, no matter the weather
This is my oath to you

[Outro: Cher Lloyd]
Oh, you should know, you should know
You should know, you should know, yeah
Oh, whoa, this is my oath to you
(Wherever you go, just always remember)
You're never alone, we're birds of a feather
(And we'll never change, no matter the weather)
This is my oath to you
