I wanna dance with you all through the night
The music is bumping and no, I don't bite
I see that you're hiding, no need to be shy
Ven para acá porque quiero bailar

[Verso 1]
A ver, dame tu mano
So, so close, así nos bailamos
Face to face, despacito
Feeling good, gozando el ritmo
Got your hands on hips
Let's salsa, no chips
So hot, don't quit
Can't believe you got me feeling like this
I don't even know your name
So can I call you what's his name?
It's so hot, can you feel the flame?
Damn, this beat is so insane
3Ball, keep it rocking
Who cares if anyone's watching?
Even though the clock tick tocking
Till the morning and we ain't stopping

My body's telling me to move to the left
I see you following my lead
And let me say I'm impressed, yeah
My body's telling me to move to the right
Keep it going, keep it going, we gon' go all night

[Hook]

[Verso 2]
Yeah, déjame decirte baby
The way you move drives me crazy
Got me feeling so amazing
Hang on tight just for your safety
Cause it's about to get wild
I can tell by the look of your smile
Really digging your style
Let me make the night worth your while
Oh boy, you're right in my lane
Let's carpool, fast lane
Vroom, vroom, no shame
And tomorrow we can do it again
3Ball, keep it bumping
Everybody in the function jumping
My heart is rushing
Let me tell you boy, you got me blushing

My body's telling me to move to the left
I see you following my lead
And let me say I'm impressed, yeah
My body's telling me to move to the right
Keep it going, keep it going, we gon' go all night

[Hook]
