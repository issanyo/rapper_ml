[Verse 1]
I wasn't brought up with a silver spoon in my pocket
Mama didn't raise no fool
They're telling em that I'm hot, I say "cool"
Get your facts straight, I am a Gomez, but no I don't know Selena
Not a rich kid, but I'm a boss bitch, drive my Toyota like it's a Bimmer
Carpool on that 405, two brothers and I got one sister
Right next to my dad with his head turned back, shotgun, never touched no trigger
When they see this cover girl, the place get nuts, mother's squirrel
I'ma let that line sink in for a minute while I'm visitin' another world
Blast off, I got a little bit of fuel in my jetpack
Travellin' to the moon when I get back
I'ma give it everything, tell em whenever they ring
That I mean it every time that they said that
Who they think they're talking to?
This my town they're walking through

[Pre-Hook]
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue

[Hook]
Dodger blue, Dod-Dod, Dodger blue
Yes I might get down with a little red lipstick
But I bleed Dodger blue
Dodger blue, Dod-Dod, Dodger blue
Yes I might get down, down, Dod-Dod-Dod, Dodger blue

[Verse 2]
LA's all on my back, but the weight won't hurt me
New Jay's, doin' 2 a day, got Yasiel on my jersey
And I'm thick skinned, I wanna big win, I don't play the game to get bases
Was the first rapper on Kemosabe, I don't mean to pick favorites
Let me go right now, I don't wanna slow down, cause I put my soul in this mixtape
And when I get that crown, I'ma never put it down
So I'm gonna get a little bit of shit straight
Don't let the pretty face fool ya, I know I'm new to this game
I don't buy beats, I just run em, thank you 2 Chainz

[Hook (x2)]
