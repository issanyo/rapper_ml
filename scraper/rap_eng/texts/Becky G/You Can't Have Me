Go ahead, take a step
I-I'll let you take one more
Closer baby, right there but be ware I'm a wild care
Talking that, big game, baby make it rain
Show me where the boss at

Your eyes' chasing my body when I start to [?]
So determined, you're king of the jungle, the lion
Got some tricks up my sleeve baby
Your heart's racing, making me sweat and I like it

Nananana, you want me 'cause you can't have me boy
Nananana, watching me 'cause you got no choice
Nananananana, and I'm just magnetizing
Nananana, you want me cause you can't have me boy

[Instrumental]
