I know you've been hurt
You give so much
If you look into my eyes
Give me your trust
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll be real with you

I've loved and I've lost
I've laughed and I've cried
I'll pay this cost
I'll live till I die

I'll be the same girl I am with this fame
All that money won't change me I won't be that way
I made you a promise and I'm sticking to it
Be real I'll always be real too, my word

Do they love you like I will
Tell myself in the mirror that I will
Be true to myself I'ma die real
And I gotta long way till my mill
But I feel like I'm giving you a little taste
Don't sleep on Becky, pillow case
And I seen Kanye just tweeted me
When I meet him I'ma tell him what he mean to me
I'm in the lab with Dr. Luke working on my album till it drop for you
Everyone like hey, no stopping you
Cause I think about everything I got to do
And I just saw my pub deal and it feels like it's so real
Walking this road going uphill
Drinking all this in till my cup fill

I'm not living in hurry
I feel this music inside
See this so clearly no need to worry
I need you all in my life
If you let me here's what I'll do
I'll be real with you

I've loved and I've lost
I've laughed and I've cried
I'll pay this cost
I'll live till I die
