[Intro: Mr Eazi & Becky G]
Is all enough
Yeah

[Verse: Becky G]
Got me losing myself
And I can’t explain it
Got me losing myself
Mute the voices in my head, my head

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own

[Chorus: Becky G]
Oh Say what you want but I can’t hear it
Baby please don’t go, Baby please
Oh Say what you want but I can’t hear it
Baby please don’t go, Baby please
Don’t Go

[Verse: Mr Eazi]
Torn up letters
So many things I wish I said
I miss the days when
We were young without a care
Skimming stones, feels like the future is behind
And I'm gaining by myself

[Pre-Chorus: Both]
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own
So please don’t go, I can’t do it on my own, I can’t do it on my own

[Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Ohsay what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please, baby please (baby please)
Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please, don't go, baby please, don't go
No, no, no, no, woah
No, don't let go

[Bridge: Mr Eazi & Becky G]
Please don't go, I can't do it on my own (I can't do it on my own)
So please don't go, I can't do it on my own (Ohh, woah)

[Chorus: Becky G & Both]
Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please, baby please
Oh say what you want but I can't hear it
Baby please don't go, baby please
Don't go, Nah-uh
Don't go, Nah-uh
