[Verse 1]
I need somethin', I know it's you
No harm intended; do you feel it too?
It's a violent delight when we hit it tonight, yeah
So don't try to fight it; get on my bad side, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh
I know what they try to be telling you
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh
She's a wild mustang and she ain't no good

Cause all I am is trouble trouble trouble, hey
They don't understand how you can be my bae
All I am is trouble trouble trouble, hey
The people think that I'm the crazy one in town but
They have no idea

[Beat/Break]
Trouble, trouble, trouble, hey!
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tell me something, what you gonna do ooh ooh
Because I know how I feel, what about you ooh ooh
It's a violent delight yeah, so don't try to fight it
Tonight you are mine boy, so stop tryna hide it

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh
I know what they try to be telling you
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh oh
She's a wild mustang and she ain't no good

Cause all I am is trouble trouble trouble, hey
They don't understand how you can be my bae
All I am is trouble trouble trouble, hey
The people think that I'm the crazy one in town but
They have no idea

[Beat/Break]
Trouble, trouble, trouble, hey!
Yeah, yeah
