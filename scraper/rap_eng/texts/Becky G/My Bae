[Intro]
Uh, yeah, Chill

[Verse]
Needle in the haystack, limited edition
Rare and original, indeed
And they all wanna touch it
Better not touch it
Tell them all fallback, that's me

[Pre-Chorus]
I be in it like Eyy, that's my shit
And I want all of y'all to know it
Facebook, Instagram, I don't trip
Baby go ahead and post them pics
I don't really give a damn what they say
Tell the whole world that you're my bae
And ain't nobody taking your spot
Cause baby you everything they not

[Chorus]
Somebody singing
My bae everything
They not, he everything
They not, he everything
They not, Aye
Somebody singing
My bae everything
They not, he everything
They not, he everything
They not, Aye
My baby, bae bae !
