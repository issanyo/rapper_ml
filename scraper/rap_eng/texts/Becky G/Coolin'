[Verse 1]
Yeah
I give you one shot
Hit me with your best
Hotter than a wet T-shirt contest
Better back up before you get a taste
Inglewood baby getting all up in your face like uhg
Gorilla on the beat
Make' em sweat like chinchilla in the heat
All the boys want my friendship bracelet
But I be back in the lab cooking for a banquet

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the top down
Put your cups up, this is our town
Even the vatos stop and call out
Becky cold Becky cold like Moscow
You know you like it when I get buck wild
When I play on my merry go round
With my face talkin off that clown
I'll be like shhhh, don't make a sound

[Chorus]
Cause we're coolin, coolin coolin
Everybody coolin, coolin, coolin
And we're coolin, coolin, coolin
Everybody coolin, coolin, coolin
And we're coolin

[Verse 2]
Tell me who be flying in the air
Dragon in the sky breathing fire down your neck
Baby chillax before you get a cold
Liu Kang quick game, that'll have you froze like brrrr
Sub Zero on the beat
When I'm on the mike it's a Fatality
Finally a youngin who's not basic
I don't just eat the cake, I make it

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the top down, put your cups up, this is our town
Even the white boys stop and call out
Becky cold Becky cold like Moscow
You know you like it when I get buck wild
When I play on my merry go round
With my face talkin off that clown
I'll be like shhhh, don't make a sound

[Chorus]
Cause we're coolin, coolin coolin
Everybody coolin, coolin, coolin
And we're coolin, coolin, coolin
Everybody coolin, coolin, coolin
And we're coolin
