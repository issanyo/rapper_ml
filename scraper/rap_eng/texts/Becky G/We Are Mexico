[Verse]
Hard work, double time, over time, two jobs
Working 'til our heads hurt
But we ain't never late to pay the bills
Mother said always follow your heart
Make sure to keep your head above the water
And I promised her I always will
I see fifty latinos, fifty latinas
That's my crib on a weekend
That's mi familia
Talking in Spanglish
En Español
I'm just here to let you know
If you don't know, now you know
We are Mexico
It don't matter where we go
Viva México
