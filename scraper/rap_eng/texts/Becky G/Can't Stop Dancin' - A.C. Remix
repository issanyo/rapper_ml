The lights are shining like the sun out tonight
Just keep your body moving how I like
Oh yeah the music feels like paradise
Can't get any better, no

I wanna stay right in this moment for life
Baby treat me wrong, treat me right

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye

Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Your mind is going places I can feel
That further lets me know this is real
And I won't stop, you know I like it there
You can even go further babe
Cause nothing's forbidden
I wanna stay right in this moment for life
Baby treat me wrong, treat me right

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye

Again now
Spin around now
Down now, to the floor now

Believe it, I feel it
It's in the air
Although you can't see you know it's there
My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive
Once the music hits my body I feel so alive
(To the floor now)
Believe it, I feel it
It's in the air
Although you can't see you know it's there
My heart keeps on racing, in overdrive
Once the music hits my body I feel so alive
It's got me like

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
Don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing

Ay ay ay, aye
Just can't stop dancing
Ay ay ay, aye
I don't wanna chance it
So don't let go, let go of me
Don't let go, let go of me
Ay ay ay, aye
I just can't stop dancing
