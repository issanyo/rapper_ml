[Intro: Becky G & (Austin Mahone)]
Hi, my name is Becky and I approve this message
(Get it, Becky!)

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Abracadabra
Call me the mind master
I cast a spell on every beat
The rabbits out the hat, huh
Every show a new surprise
I leave them mesmerized
Got all the fellas hypnotized
With all my magic lines
I’m a magician
Yes yo soy un mago
Si quieres ver mi magia
Nomás me dices cuando
Soon you’ll start to believe
Open your eyes and see
It’s Austin Mahone and Becky G

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track, it turns into gold
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me

[Verse 2: Becky G]
I got some tricks up my sleeve
Just wait and see
Come little closer
Close your eyes and count to three
Open, voila, so spectacular
I even got magic to make the haters disappear
I got my rhymes
They’re like my special potion
So when I start to rap them the whole track starts turning golden
And now I’m through
It’s the end of verse two
Like bippity-boppity-boo

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
Every time I tought that track, it turns into gold
(Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
(They be snapping baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me
I got the magic in me

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik, (ma, ma, ma, ma..)

[Chorus: Austin Mahone & (Becky G)]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
Every time I tought that track, it turns into gold
(Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
(They be snapping baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me
