Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

Stranger and stranger
Everyone's a stranger
It's hatred and anger and everyone's in danger
Lions ant Tigers and demons and wolf packs, runnin, you keep runnin but you just too scared to look back
Keep you mind forward none of this is really happinin
As soon as you escape the fantasies come back again
Relapse, tell yourself to relax
Chillin take your seat back
This is all just a dream that's
A glimpse anf it's ruining your vision, puttin you into submission, it's breathin, it's coughin, it's teasin, it's stalkin
It takes you by the heart and pulls you deep in the coffin
It's callin and I can feel it watchin
I see it through my eyelids and my mind is filled with violence
I'm stranded on an island
I may need a sum of silence
But I keep on hearin Sirens and I can't really take it
Enough of fighting darkness it's time I just embrace it

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

It's like a monster coming to get me
I'm trying to run but they playing high dancey
The twisten up my mind
They makin me crazy
Like a tornado
Oh tsunami brakin Haiti
All i know is
I need to get away
But something made me curious and made me want to stay
The skys no longer blue and the clouds are turnin grey
The waters turnin red and the lights are fadin away

Dreams become reality
Livin in a tragedy
Lool at this catastrophe
The story is unraveling
Changen up the strategies they prey becomes the predator
Fillin up the raptor
With never mores and metaphors
Ballet of the dead come from every single stanza
Lookni for the angels but the devils had me ambushed
Reachin for the sky and hope I levitate fly
I'm a goony till the end cause goonies never say die

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

I know a place
Where things are so strange
And your make believing
But you aren't dreaming
And the worlds still turning
That your mind is sterling

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me
