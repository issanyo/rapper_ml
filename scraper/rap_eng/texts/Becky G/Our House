[Intro]
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh, ah ah oh

[Verse 1]
Built from the ground up like a champion
A little messed up but not broken
We've gone too far to let this go
We're gonna stand up, gotta fight on

[Pre-Chorus]
You underestimate us
You think you're untouchable
And you don't know what we're made of
But now we're gonna let you know
Oh that you not the greatest
I won't hide anymore
So don't underestimate us, underestimate us

[Chorus]
This is our house, you know we bringing it
Watch us get loud, you ain't seen nothing yet
Go ahead and take a shot
Let me show what we've got
Cause this is our house, we won't let you forget

[Post-Chorus]
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh

[Verse 2]
Gave you some tough talk, hurt your ego
Trip off that cool walk
Was it our show?
How does it feel down on the floor?
That's just how it goes when you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
You underestimate us
You think you're untouchable
And you don't know what we're made of
But now we're gonna let you know
Oh that you not the greatest
I won't hide anymore
So don't underestimate us, underestimate us

[Chorus]
This is our house, you know we bringing it
Watch us get loud, you ain't seen nothing yet
Go ahead and take a shot
Let me show what we've got
Cause this is our house, we won't let you forget

[Post-Chorus]
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh

[Bridge]
You don't know what we're made of
You underestimate us
You don't know what we're made of
You underestimate us

[Chorus]
This is our house, you know we bringing it
Watch us get loud, you ain't seen nothing yet
Go ahead and take a shot
Let me show what we've got
Cause this is our house, we won't let you forget

[Post-Chorus]
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh
Ah ah oh, ah ah oh
