[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Uh
Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
Nine to five grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money, then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, backseat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted
Smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart, in the club she go hard
Shake her ass and titties
I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell 'em that you love em
I say, 'Take it off'

[Chorus: Kesha]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Post-Chorus: Becky G]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh
No changing us
Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cause money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff
I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and ragin'
Ball so hard, I think I'm gon' be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

[Chorus: Kesha & Becky G, Both]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Yo, ke$ha
We're gonna die young
Becky g, remix
We're gonna die young
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Post-Chorus: Becky G & Kesha]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Verse 3: Becky G]
Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm stayin' on my grind, grind
You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye
When I rap, all the boys go cray cray
Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man
Whatcha gonna say?

[Pre-Chorus: Ke$ha]
Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh-huh)
We'll keep dancing 'till we die

[Chorus: Kesha]
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

[Post-Chorus: Becky G & Kesha]
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
