All the new rappers

I can see the future
I made history
Started with the guitar
Singing in the kitchen
Mommie yelling at me
I told her just listen

Was in trouble
So I had to make a smile
Cause I accidentally broke my new laptop like wow
Big dummy
She was using curse words
And I can't repeat 'em
But that was what

She first heard
Started believing
She was looking at me
Anger went to happy
Perfect

That's what my music did
You can never roun it
Put my life on the pages is why I'm doing it
I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

The music is, is what I need everyday
So let this song fade away
When life is getting in the way
No, no, novacane
Ooh ohh novacane
Ohh baby novacane

All the music is my novacane
Ohh, baby
My heart's in music
So I'm never dying
Doesn't matter if I barely stop trying

Taught myself to sing
Sing along with brandy's
Studied every wrong
Cause I'm trynna win a Grammy
I'm getting better
But I always stay humble
And daddy say pick it up if I fumble

Rapping's in my blood
I've been doing this forever
Only been around about a decade whatever
Age doesn't matter
Neither do the spotlights
I was made for this game
No spotlights
Keep going even if the race's done
I'm writing songs till I finally place one

They take the money
Send my family on vacation
I ain't leaving the whole world is waiting
This is just a sample
Album coming soon
Seen in the city
Make some room

That's what my music did you can never ruin it
Put my life on the pages is why I'm doing it
I had to make a song for you
And then my show is sing along with you

That's what I need every day
So let this song fade away
When life is getting in your way
Noo, noo, novacane
Ohh, novacane
Ooh, baby
Novacane
All the music is my novacane
Oooh, baby
