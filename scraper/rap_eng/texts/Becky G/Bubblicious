[Intro]
I know you're trynna get in this candy rubber
I can see it in your eyes

[Chorus]
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' blow me kisses
Brown sugar can't resist this
Sweeter than candy
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' buy me giftses
They do anything to get this
Sweeter than candy

[Verse 1]
Watching my ? they feeling my caramel
Got they heads spinning like they up on a carousel
They be licking they lips
They watching my hips
They see this juice box and they all wanna sip, they all wanna sip, they all wanna sip
They get a little taste and they don't wanna quit
Yeah, they can't losen they grip I caught these boys messing but they want it too quickly

[Hook]
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
If you looking for a trip to escape, boy
Make them get down on they knees, make them pray for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Errybody in the club go cray for it
Make 'em drop from the Bay to L.A. for it

[Chorus]
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' blow me kisses
Brown sugar can't resist this
Sweeter than candy
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' buy me giftses
They do anything to get this
Sweeter than candy

[Verse 2]
I'm flyer than gravity, I'm givin' em cavities
Let's see if they can last like a Duracell battery
They callin' her majesty, they hoping and wishing
They're tryna rubb up on me like they're washing the dishes, washing the dishes, washing the dishes
I got em all hooked like I'm walking and fishing
Yeah, I be mixing them with me
They trynna' get this paper it's to hot in the kitchen

[Hook]
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
If you looking for a trip to escape, boy
Make them get down on they knees, make them pray for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Make 'em wait for it (for it)
Errybody in the club go cray for it
Make 'em drop from the Bay to L.A. for it

[Bridge]
Hold up
This cherry red light car (this cherry red light car)
You watching my tootsie roll (roll, roll)
I'm making that gum dry
I hope you're ready for, ready for
Hold up

[Chorus]
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' blow me kisses
Brown sugar can't resist this
Sweeter than candy
Boys say I'm bubblicious
So they trynna' buy me giftses
They do anything to get this
Sweeter than candy
