[Intro]
(¡Uno...dos...tres!)

[Chorus]
I drive you crazy shaking my money maker
You looking at me, all the way over there
Don't be shy, baby, just come on over here
Keep it up don’t quit
And maybe you can get it

[Verse 1]
So tripping all over my body
Tell me, don't I look exotic?
I know you wanna get me
First let me take a selfie
Ooh, I'm hotter than a toaster
Me and my home girls post up
I say that so that you know what’s down
You ain't never seen a honey that fine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your thoughts in your eyes
Baby what you want isn't a surprise
If you want some of this love I got 'cause
Your heart keeps racing and it just can't stop

[Chorus]
I drive you crazy shaking my money maker
You looking at me, all the way over there
Don't be shy, baby, just come on over here
Keep it up, don't quit
And maybe you can get it

[Verse 2]
I can see why you so hot
'Cause Becky turned down on the block
Shake that JELLO just like J. Lo
You looking, you wish you could touch
Keep flirting, you making me blush
Fire burning, mucha gasolina
I turn around, baby do the macarena

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see your thoughts in your eyes
Baby what you want isn’t a surprise
If you want some of this love I got ’cause
Your heart keeps racing and it just can't stop

[Chorus]
I drive you crazy shaking my money maker
You looking at me, all the way over there
Don’t be shy, baby, just come on over here
Keep it up, don't quit
And maybe you can get it

[Outro]
Here we go now
Money, money
Maybe you can get it
