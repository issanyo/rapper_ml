You don't know what you do when you talking like that
Got me feeling all, woo!
All the girls stand back, stand back, stand back
I wanna show you what's going on in my head
There ain't nothing with a little naughty
I think we both know why I came to call it
I ain't gon' leave till I have your body on me

You're trying so hard to keep your composure
Tracing my hips so watch 'em go slower
I can see that you're losing control, yeah
So know, know, know, boy
Know, know, know, boy

It's crazy [?] blame me
'Cause I'm a little bit crazy
I don't want you to save me, baby, don't you save me
'Cause I'm cray-cray-cray-crazy for ya
