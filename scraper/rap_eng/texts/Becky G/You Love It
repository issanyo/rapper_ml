[Verse 1]
I just, I just, I just wanna load this on a pod
Call up my homegirls and put it up in the car
Ride through the city and run through the lights
It’s gonna be our theme song for trouble tonight
See a cutie pull up right next to me, next to me
Gave him the digits, he can’t stop texting me, texting me
We just riding, we rolling, you know how we cruise
And when this come on, yeah, you know how we do (Let’s go)

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna hear something to make you wild and crazy
Beat the block up like Turner (Beat it)
Every time you chilling and you with your homies
You need a little something for the turn up (We need it)

[Chorus]
You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club
Keep it on replay, show me some love
Over and over again, make it your song
Party to this one until the morn
Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin')

[Verse 2]
So turn it up to the max
The louder it gets the more I wanna shake my ass
This beat hit so hard I swear that it hurt
This beat hit so hard it makes you wanna twerk
Fellas looking they keep jocking me
My body moving so they watching me
I’m gonna give you something you can look, look, look at
As soon as the doctor give me that boom boom boom pat

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna hear something to make you wild and crazy
Beat the block up like Turner (Beat it)
Every time you chilling and you with your homies
You need a little something for the turn up (We need it)

[Chorus]
You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club
Keep it on replay, show me some love
Over and over again, make it your song
Party to this one until the morn
Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin')

[Bridge]
Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin'
Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin'
Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin'
Keep it bumpin', keep, keep it bumpin'
Keep, keep, keep, keep
Turn it up, play it loud
And don’t you stop, blow the speakers out
Ow, yeah

[Chorus]
You should turn this up on your radio and play it in the club
Keep it on replay, show me some love
Over and over again, make it your song
Party to this one until the morn
Cause I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
I know, I know, I know, I know you love it
(You love, you love)
So turn it up and baby keep it bumpin' (just keep it bumpin')
