[Verse 1: Becky G]
Counting the days, waited all year
Sit back and celebrate when Christmas time is near
Once, too soon, I bought your gift in May
Can't believe we're here on my favorite holiday

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
There's been times before you wish for so much more
When I was down and filled with doubt, I had you
And we made it through the year, it's so good to be here

[Chorus: Becky G]
So we put it in a song, dance the way we want, turn the fire on
Baby, we can hang it up together, give to one another
Snuggle through the weather
Baby, Christmas, c'mon
Baby, Christmas, c'mon

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Put the star on the tree
Let the record spin while dancing next to me
Keep me warm from the snow
Under the mistletoe, we'll watch the fire glow

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
There's been times before you wish for so much more
When I was down and filled with doubt, I had you
And we made it through the year, it's so good to be here

[Chorus: Becky G]
So we put it in a song, dance the way we want, turn the fire on
Baby, we can hang it up together, give to one another
Snuggle through the weather
Baby, Christmas, c'mon
Baby, Christmas, c'mon

[Bridge: Becky G]
We made it through the year, it's so good to be here

[Chorus: Becky G]
So we put it in a song, dance the way we want, turn the fire on
Baby, we can hang it up together, give to one another
Snuggle through the weather
Baby, Christmas, c'mon
So we put it in a song, dance the way we want, turn the fire on
Baby, we can hang it up together, give to one another
Snuggle through the weather
Baby, Christmas, c'mon, yeah (Baby Christmas)
Baby, Christmas, c'mon
