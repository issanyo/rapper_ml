[Intro:]
It's the shower remix!

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Yea I own that, new car, yea I own that
Crazy color rims, they (?)
Stuntin' on Instagram, where your home at?
Oh, how you not know that? I see your bank account, lets blow that
Lemme (?) for a minute, what a minute
Hanging up, calling right back, then I told her


[Verse 2: Becky G]
I don't know if it's something about ya
Got me feelin like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mentions your name
I'll be feelin as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you babe
All I know that you take me high
Can you tell that u drive me crazy
Coz I can't get you off my mind

[Hook:]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You're my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
You're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
Singing in the shower
La da dee la da da la da da
Singing in the shower

[Verse 3: Becky G]
All I want all I need is your lovin
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came, you know what I discovered
Baby I don't need me another
Know, know, all I know
Only you got me feeling so
And you know that I got to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go


[Hook: Becky G]

[Verse 4: Tyga]
Uh, the fit get real though
Real love, so I know that it will though
(?) in like car
I'mma pick you up like a newborn
Dream on, it's the high life
I see a star in your eyes; you're just too bright
Got a good grip, you wanna hold tight
Kinda like a flashlight

[Hook: Becky G]
