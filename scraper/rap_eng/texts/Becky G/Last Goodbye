[Verse 1]
I remember the night we first met
We were so young
I can’t forget how you kissed my face (whoa)
And you took me home (whoa)
I remember the life years ago
The air mattress on the floor
That was before (whoa) a life took control

[Chorus]
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
I never thought that I would ever leave your side
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
Promise me you won’t cry
This is our last goodbye

[Verse 2]
When I was lost, I found you
When I was broke, you bought me shoes
You were my first (whoa)
And dammit this hurts (whoa)
Now you’ve got a girl, someone new
And I can’t pretend to just be cool
I can’t be your friend (whoa), so this is the end

[Chorus]
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
I never thought that I would ever leave your side
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
Promise me you won’t cry
This is our last goodbye

[Bridge]
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Promise me you won’t cry
This is our last goodbye
(Our last goodbye)

[Chorus]
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
I never thought that I would ever leave your side
Oh, how we lost our minds when we fell in love that night
Promise me you won’t cry
This is our last goodbye

[Bridge]
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
Promise me you won’t cry
This is our last goodbye
(Our last goodbye)
