[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & (Fifth Harmony)]
This must be some kinda joke
If you think you're my type (not my type)
Poof you're gone in a cloud of smoke
I just left swipe, bye bye, I just left swipe

[Chorus: Fifth Harmony & Becky G & (King Bach)]
(Left swipe dat!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Yeah!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Left swipe that!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
That's that stuff I don't like so I gotta
(Left swipe dat!)

[Verse 1: Becky G & Harley Morenstein]
Look at you, with your shirt off, flexin'
You're buff but you puff, hashtag perplexing
Yeah, you work out- you're in shape, okay
I like the six pack abs, but not the six packs a day
Came across this photo of this green-eyed hottie
Whole nine- pretty face, tight waist, nice body
But I couldn't overlook one small fact:
She smokes like an old man at a race track

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G & (Fifth Harmony)]
This must be some kinda joke
If you think you're my type (not my type)
Poof you're gone in a cloud of smoke
I just left swipe, bye bye, I just left swipe

[Chorus: Fifth Harmony & Becky G & (King Bach)]
(Left swipe dat!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Yeah!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Left swipe that!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
That's that stuff I don't like so I gotta
(Left swipe dat!)

[Verse 2: Grace Helbig & AlphaCat]
Mr. World Traveler, your trips look expensive
Sittin' on a mountain top lookin' all pensive
I was just about to ask, how's the air up there?
But based on this pic, guess you don't really care
Lots a chicks in the pic not sure which one's you
Them cigarettes take y'all from 10s to 2s
And one thing's true 'bout your whole crew
None of you cigarellas gonna be my boo

[Bridge: ? & (King Bach)]
Smoking with a tiger? (Left swipe dat!)
While you're on a hang-glider? (Left swipe dat!)
Smoking while acting healthy? (Left swipe dat!)
Smoking all stealthy? (Left swipe dat!)
Smoking with a duckface? (Left swipe dat!)
At a monster truck race? (Left swipe dat)
Smoking at the prom? (Left swipe dat!)
Even in a photobomb? (He don't care! Left swipe dat!)

[Chorus: Fifth Harmony & Becky G & (King Bach)]
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Yeah!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left (Left swipe that!)
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
That's that stuff I don't like so I gotta
(Left swipe dat!)

[Outro: Fifth Harmony & King Bach & (Grace Helbig)]
You gotta gotta gotta swipe it left
Yeah! Hashtag!
(I'll never remember you...)
