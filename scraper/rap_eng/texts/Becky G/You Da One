[Verse]
Yeah
Are you an alien or a martian?
Got me loca, Ricky Martin
So in love, I'm fallin'
Michael Jackson, move bulkin'
You a star, I'm the moon
You da fire, I'm da boom
You da fork, won da spoon
I'm da idol, you da tune
This ain't humanly impossible, got me fellin' phenominal
We soaring through da obstacles so fuck being responsible

[Pre-Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
Three, two, one, boy you da one
Five, four, three, two, one...

[Chorus]
Ohh
Yeah we taking off the ground
We ain't ever coming down
You got me higher than the clouds
You are my galaxy tonight
We'll be flying past the stars
No one never world's apart
Let's get it loud you break our hearts
So you are my galaxy tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Five, four, three, two, one
Three, two, one, boy you da one
Five, four, three, two, one...
