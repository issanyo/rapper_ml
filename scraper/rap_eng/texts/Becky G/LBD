[Intro]
Brrp, brrp

[Chorus]
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on

[Verse 1]
I'll save the date like it's your birthday
You tell me you just want a piece of the cake (Birthday cake)
I just might let you get some today (Huh)
'Cause the way you been grinding on me
You got me feeling some type of way
I'm into all these moves

[Pre-Chorus]
Plus this McQueen, it fits me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say about girls from these sides
You wanna risk it all

[Chorus]
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on

[Verse 2]
I know you wondering what's under here (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Seen pineapples, just imagine that (Yeah, yeah)
Just a dirty little teaser (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Type of love that have you coming back (Hold up)

[Pre-Chorus]
Plus this McQueen, it fits me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say about girls from these sides
You wanna risk it all

[Chorus]
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy

[Bridge]
Es mucha tentación, tú puedes ver pero no tocar
Usa tu imaginación, que nunca sabes que va a pasar
Acércate a mí un poquito mas, oh-oh-oh
Si te portas bien te lo voy a dar

[Chorus]
Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on (My little brack dress on)
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on (Bow, bow)
