[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
Hold on, where you goin', pretty lady?
I'll take you for a ride, I can see it in your eyes
Wanna hop up in my passenger seat, baby
We'll take the city by surprise, it's just me and you tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Now, yeah we ride a little, freak
Ain't slowin' down, won't stop for nothin', 'less we on E
Now, yeah, love the way you're lookin' at me
The wind all up in your hair, and we rollin', just me and you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Baby we can go wherever you want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'

[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Girl I got some soul, haven't you noticed?
But Luther ain't the only thing playin' through my bones
Got a feeling, I can't shake it, girl I'm hopeless
I gotta have you right here with me

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Now, yeah we ride a little, freak
Ain't slowin' down, won't stop for nothin', 'less we on E
Now, yeah, love the way you're lookin' at me
The wind all up in your hair, and we rollin', just me and you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Baby we can go wherever you want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'

[Verse 3: Becky G]
I love it, I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it, I love it
Bring it back, bring it back
Boy you make my heart stop, heart attack
Windows down and we goin' fast
Don't care where we goin' next
As long as it's you, me with the radio loud
Sun shinin' bright while we're cruisin' your town
East side of the west side
By you is the best side
I could do this every day
No, no don't step on the brakes
Munchin' on that Chick-fil-a
Off of fries and a large lemonade
I love when we up in the streets
Down by my hood or the beach
Got one hand on my thigh, other hand on the window
It don't get no better than me

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Baby we can go wherever you want
Are you with me? Why don't you take the seat in the front?
And we rollin', we rollin', your hands are all on me
Doin' 95 in a '65, tryin' to chase eternity
And I want you with me
We rollin', we rollin'
