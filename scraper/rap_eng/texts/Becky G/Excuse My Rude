[Verse 1: Jessie J]
(Me-me-me-me-me) That's all you ever talk about
(Me-me-me-me-me) Sick of when you scream and shout
(Me-me-me-me-me) So baby, go and run your mouth
R-r-run your mouth, r-r-run your mouth
(I-I-I-I-I) I try and show you that I'm there
(I-I-I-I-I) I end up ripping out my hair
(Why-I-I-I-I?) Do I even wanna care?
W-w-wanna care, wanna, care, care

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one
To fall for it and let you in
To mess it up, once again
I'm over it, so here it is
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you

[Verse 2: Jessie J]
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) This isn't how it was before
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah) Now I'm the girl you can't ignore
(Now-wow-wow-wow-wow) I'm brave enough to say no more
No more, no more, n-n-n-n-nor more, more
(Do-woe-woe-woe-woe) You even want to understand
(Do-woe-woe-woe-woe) You think you're still in command
(Do-woe-woe-woe-won't) You see I got the upper hand
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one
To fall for it and let you in
To mess it up, once again
I'm over it, so here it is
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you

[Verse 3: Becky G]
They say hate is a strong word, but I got that urge
Treat me like a waiter, so you better get served
With that Becky G special, I'm shakin' your credentials
Acting like a Benz, but to me you just a rental, keep it simple
It's not about the cars acting hard, it's too easy
Boy, you gotta please me, believe me
So I hit you on the telly when I'm in your areay next Nevuary

[Chorus: Jessie J]
I can't believe that this is what it's come to
I've held it in, but it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you
I never thought I'd be the one
To fall for it and let you in
To mess it up, once again
I'm over it, so here it is
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you
