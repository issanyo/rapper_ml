[Chorus]
All night, all day
You keep hitting on my window pane
But that's what I like, I can't complain
You keep me coming down like rain
Down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain

[Verse 1]
Messing with my brain, put it in your face
Tell me how it, tell me how it, tell me how it taste
We can play a game, let's play "chase the pussycat"
Don't let me escape
You can put it down, do it like a butcher
Chop it, chop it up, baby come and push it
You know what I want and yeah I want it good shit
Every time I love it, baby that is all I need

[Chorus]
All night, all day
You keep hitting on my window pane
But that's what I like, I can't complain
You keep me coming down like rain
Down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain

[Verse 2]
You look pretty scared, don't you be afraid
Let me take you, let me take you on my escapade
Up on top the bed, I hope that you're brave
Go on better lick know I'm wetter then the waves
Baby, cowabunga
I get pretty wild, welcome to the jungle
Whips and cuffs and chains if you'll be my lover
Or you'll soon discover, baby that is all I need

[Chorus]
All night, all day
You keep hitting on my window pane
But that's what I like, I can't complain
You keep me coming down like rain
Down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain

[Bridge]
It's raining, it's pouring
The water keep coming, yeah
Pouring like bottles
I see the sparkles, sparkles, sparkles
It's raining, it's pouring
The water keep coming, yeah
Pouring like bottles
I see the sparkles

[Chorus]
All night, all day (all day)
You keep hitting on my window pane
But that's what I like, I can't complain (complain)
You keep me coming down like rain
Down like rain (Keep me coming down like rain)
You keep me coming down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain

[Outro]
You keep me coming down like rain
You keep me coming down like rain
