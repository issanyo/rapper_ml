Bim bom ba dom
Bim bom ba ba dom
Bim bom ba padadom
Bim bom ba padadom

Say like I'm tryna be nice (yep)
But for my heart I ain't that type to roll the dice, oh
So let me know bet for you tryna spend the night (yep)
You won't be touching on my body, turn everybody
Claming on this body (oh)
Unless your acting type of way

So this what you need to do now
Fuck the cruel and act a fool now
Oh you gotta like to prove now

If you wanna rock with me baby
Gotta have that special something
Gotta really be my loving like
Woo hoo ho hoo ho

Bim bom ba dom
Woo hoo ho hoo ho
Bim bom ba dom
Woo hoo ho hoo ho
