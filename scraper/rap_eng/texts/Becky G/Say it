See you from across the room
First word to my mouth was 'oo'
I know that you want me, too
So whatcha whatcha gon' do, do
We can take it to the dance floor
Shake shake to the tango
Oh, boy your eyes glow
Tonight you lookin' like

I'm feeling woozy
You've got my head in the clouds
And when I'm up this high, no, there ain't comin' down
Oh Imma lose it, can't keep my hands to myself
Got me up so bad and I think you can tell

You say you need me, so why'd ya leave me?
You know you want this so come on and say it now
You're so enticing, don't wanna like it
But I can't hide it, boy, come on and say it now
Say it now, say it now
La la la la la
Boy, come on and say it now
Say it now, say it now
La la la la la
Boy, come on and say it now

Say it
Say it

Hey, baby, you can come on over
Come on, come a little bit closer
Ain't gotta think twice, I don't bite, you know you lie
Like what you see when you lookin' at me
While I rock to the beat, it's gettin' hot

I'm feeling woozy
You've got my head in the clouds
And when I'm up this high, no, there ain't comin' down
Oh Imma lose it, can't keep my hands to myself
Got me up so bad and I think you can tell

You say you need me, so why'd ya leave me?
You know you want this so come on and say it now
You're so enticing, don't wanna like it
But I can't hide it, boy, come on and say it now
Say it now, say it now
La la la la la
Boy, come on and say it now
Say it now, say it now
La la la la la
Boy, come on and say it now
Say it now
Say it now
La la la la la
Boy, come on and say it now
