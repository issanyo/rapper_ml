[Verse 1]
I'm motion tee this is poetry
Use my flow to speak
Notice me I be in these pictures with the coldest piece
Frozen speech all the shit I say is always over fleek
Bro it's B to that's how I'm supposed to be
Disconnect with people who just want to disrespect
Dissin Beck probably mean you're the one who listen best
Hold me back young Latina breeding on this silver track
Focus rap just for me to see if y'all can grow with that

[Pre-Chorus]
Grow
Nanana Eh Eh
Just for me to see if y'all can grow with that
Nanana Eh Eh
Just for me to see if y'all can grow with that

[Chrous]
We want to love like the best of us
We want to live out the greatest lives
And they can't take anything away from us
Because we grow, we grow, we grow

We want to live like they can't kill us
And we celebrate living life
Don't give a fuck if they don't feel us
Because we grow, we grow, we grow

[Verse 2]
No control all my fans keep tellin me let this go
To spit the flow I ain't changed a bit and now I'm not going to stop it no
I'm going now for my 818ers to all my 323 LAers
Beast mode I'm going to unleash this flow flow until they feel this
And I know I'm so outrageous
Some of my family don't care that I'm famous
I've been a star before I can speak and I don't speak to haters
I ain't got time for people who huffing and puffing
Only positive attitudes filled with gratitude when I was broke and living on hope my daddy all he had to do is

[Pre-Chorus]
Grow
Nanana Eh Eh
Just for me to see if y'all can grow with that
Grow

[Chrous]
We want to love like the best of us
We want to live out the greatest lives
And they can't take anything away from us
Because we grow, we grow, we grow

We want to live like they can't kill us
And we celebrate living life
Don't give a fuck if they don't feel us
Because we grow, we grow, we grow

[Outro]
Hold me back young Latina breeding this on this silver track
Focus rap just for me to see if y'all can grow with that
