[Verse 1: Becky G]
What you need? What you, what you need?
We ain't got no expectations
We ain't got no limitations
What you mean? What you, what you mean?
Body show me motivation
Baby why you hesitating?

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
I know you wanna get it
Stop pretenting that you wanna take time, take time
Only got a minute
If you're with it, we can do it all night, all night

[Chorus: Becky G]
Bonnie and Clyde on the high chase
Switching the lanes while we bang bae
Right til we die, baby, no pace
Oh yeah yeah yay
Breaking me down like an earthquake
Making it rain like a hurricane
Do what we like, baby, no shame
Oh yeah yeah yay

[Break: Becky G]
I do it for the thrill
Thrill
Thrill
Thrill
I do it for

[Verse 2]
Chopper sounds, search rights
We ride the gas, we won this
Imma let you drive, we don't do what's right
Bonnie and Clyde, you and me against the world, we will win this fight

[Verse 3: Becky G]
You know me, you know, you know me
I think about the consequences
We don't need no common senses
Shotgun, light the gasoline
Fire trucks and ambulances
Crossing lines and jumping fences

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G]
I know you wanna get it
Stop pretenting that you wanna take time, take time
Only got a minute
If you're with it, we can do it all night, all night

[Chorus: Becky G]
Bonnie and Clyde on the high chase
Switching the lanes while we bang bae
Right til we die, baby, no pace
Oh yeah yeah yay
Breaking me down like an earthquake
Making it rain like a hurricane
Do what we like, baby, no shame
Oh yeah yeah yay

[Break: Becky G]
I do it for the thrill

[Bridge]
Nah-ah-ah
Nah-ah-ah-ah-ah-hey
Nah-ah-ah
Nah-ah-ah-ah-ah-hey

[Outro: Becky G]
Bonnie and Clyde on the high chase
Switching the lanes while we bang bae
Right til we die, baby, no pace
Oh yeah yeah yay
Breaking me down like an earthquake
Making it rain like a hurricane
Do what we like, baby, no shame
Oh yeah yeah yay
I do it for the thrill
I do it for the thrill
I do it for the thrill
