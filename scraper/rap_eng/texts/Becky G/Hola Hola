Had a boy named Sammy Sosa
He had a lot of chips but ain't gonna cost you
He was more of an impostor
It was better till I snapped like a lobster
But then I met Nico from Puerto Rico
Didn't have bread, more like a burrito
Then I was mad, he was just bad
I don't really, really wanna think about that
Then I saw you, you were so cool
Had me like ooh, I was like dude
Not to be rude, he got it like that
Celebrate, you hear me man?

Hola hola
I know you wanna, wanna hola hola
So go ahead, come on over, over
Oh boy, you had me at hola hola

You had me at hola hola
I know you wanna, wanna hola hola
So go ahead, come on over, over
Oh boy you had me at hola hola

Had to tell my ex adios
'Cause you were hotter than a jalapeno
My lingo is bilingual
So here's number, bingo
Let's la la la la bamba
You make me go pi√±ata
You don't gotta even try to make me laugh

You had me at hola hola
I know you wanna, wanna hola hola
So go ahead, come on over, over
Oh boy, you had me at hola hola

Baby, now you're speaking my language
Just tell me you're down
And you don't really gotta explain it
Just tell me right now
Boy, you make my heart go
You make my heart go
