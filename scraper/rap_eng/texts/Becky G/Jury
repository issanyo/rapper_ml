[Intro]
Let's go
Yeah haha

[Verse]
Oh they tell me "Becky, Becky, you better hurry"
The public out here waiting for records like they're the jury
Okay, I'm bout to drop it, drop it
If you don't like it you can hate it
But nobody's been more patient than me, so now I'm done waiting
I'm taking the fate of my own into my own hands
Started rapping on Otis and now I'm noticing fans
Telling me that they love it, love it, they want more of it
Dropping a fat beat and I'm putting vocals above it
No this isn't the mixtape, no this isn't the album
This is just something to show people I'm about it
No this isn't the single I just went and I leaked it
I just want you to go and tell your peoples to beep it
Now I'm sleeping on planes more than I'm sleeping at home
Trying to remember what it's like to be alone
And all I wanna do is meet up with every fan
And tell them to they face how thankful for them I am
With that I am still struggling
I ain't saying I'm balling but I'm bumping in the studio
Cooking, preheat the oven cause I'm coming
I'm running, I'm staying hungry like I ain't eaten in hours
Got these people singing in they showers
All I'm doing is working, signing my name in cursive
Walking through Inglewood pulling verses out my purses
Hot as my momma is, short as the comma is
Making my name known just like Obama did
Started with 2 fans, I'm up in these news stands
Tripping off how I'm getting free sneakers from shoe brands
People just want to hate, isn't that so funny
So much time spent doing something for no money
