[Verse 1]
I've seen the inside of half a dozen studios
Live on the microphone
I know about half a dozen Julios
California girl, I'm feeling right at home
I've seen a person lie with a smile on
I'm on an uphill battle, a mile long
But I respect everyone who laid bricks down
For me to stomp my Converse kicks 'round
I see you Left Eye, I feel you right now
I know you woulda never put this mic down
You left too soon but everybody gotta fall
I hope you hear me every time I'm singing "Waterfalls"
You know that I'm a MC right?
Never would have been without MC Lyte
And Lauren Hill sang and played the guitar
I used to listen and dream one day I'd get far
I'm too young to be a queen but I respect Latifah
And if you're listening I hope one day I get to meet ya
'Cause I act too, I write screenplays
And rock loud when I'm listening to Green Day
I love Michael, I still can't believe it
And when I act dead, mamma tells me beat it
And Christina taught me how to belt the notes out
And Little Mama win hard, what you know about
Everybody I was influenced by
Every star was a fan just like you and I
So put your hands up like you about to fight the sky
I wanna see the whole word put your lighters high

[Hook]
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh

[Verse 2]
I see the night time sky glowing right now
Just take it in
And I respect everyone that's going right now
That's what it takes to win
I see you Ke$ha, I can't even lie
When you and Luke make a track, I turn my speakers high
Nicki remind the females it's okay to rap
And I'm a low key fan, I'm just waiting back
And Karmin showed everyone what you do
If you post the right videos on YouTube
Rebecca Black got a hundred million hits
And I don't curse, but damn that's the shi-
And it's Saturday, so no school
Katy Perry made Teenage Dream so cool
I understand this game, that's why I never hate
It only hurts people, I like to celebrate
And I would say "thank you" if I knew Bruno Mars
'Cause I'm borrowing his hook again and two more bars
Slim, I'm a fan, you made history
Now put your lighters in the air
And sing with me

[Hook]
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, uh, whoa
The sky's filled with lighters, ooh, ah
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh
The sky's filled with lighters, oh (hey, hey)
The sky's filled with lighters, oh (hey, hey)
The sky's filled with lighters, oh (hey, hey)
The sky's filled with lighters, oh (hey, hey)
