[Verse 1]
Secretly you wanted me to fall in love
But I told you I was coming out of something serious
You keep pushing me, pushing me, pushing me to lie
Never had the time to make up my mind
Telling myself that you're too good to be true
How can someone who hates himself be in love with you
Try fixing you, fixing you, fixing all your flaws
How did I end up with a broken heart

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep lying to me and I just wanna believe in something
I wanna hold on to something, oh

[Chorus]
If you sent me roses every time that you have broken my heart
Then I'd have a garden by now
If you sent me flowers to make up for every hour we lost
Then I'd have a garden by now
I'd have a garden, I'd have a garden, I'd have garden
I'd have garden by now

[Verse 2]
It's hard enough waking up next to who you love
When you know you won't ever be his reciprocal
Try leaving him, leaving him, leaving him alone
But I take him back, but it's getting old

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep lying to me and I just wanna believe in something
I wanna hold on to something, oh

[Chorus]
If you sent me roses every time that you have broken my heart
Then I'd have a garden by now
If you sent me flowers to make up for every hour we lost
Then I'd have a garden by now
I'd have a garden, I'd have a garden, I'd have garden
I'd have garden by now

[Bridge]
All this stress on my brain got me going insane
If I can count all the lies I'd have me a bouquet
You stuck me with a thorn, I'm just numb to the pain
Thought about getting high, just to take it away
Now you're sending me roses
Banging at my door saying "Baby baby, please open!"
Nah uh! Yeah
I could probably be a florist
After all the times you messed up I could probably start a forest

[Chorus]
If you sent me roses every time that you have broken my heart
Then I'd have a garden by now
If you sent me flowers to make up for every hour we lost
Then I'd have a garden by now
I'd have a garden, I'd have a garden, I'd have garden
I'd have garden by now
