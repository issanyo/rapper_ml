[Hook:]
Slow down, ain't no zoomin' zoomin'
Slow down, ain't no zoomin' zoomin'
Slow down, ain't no zoomin' zoomin'
Slow down, ain't no zoomin', no zoom
Hey!

[Verse 1:]
You can win my my love
But there's a trick though
Come figure me out
I can't give you a tip though
There be no dreamy eyes
I don't fall for hypno
Here goes a hint,  I'll keep it simple
I'm no sympth though
These boys be tripping
Chasing back to kiss they lips though
They send me texts and send me pics
They think they slick though
Some send me flowers
And some act just like some sickos
Want to win it? Wait a minute!

[Chorus:]
If you act nice, you can get it
If you act right, you can get it
If you want my love, better win it
If you want my love, better win it
If you all lies then forget it
If you uptight then forget it
If you want my love, better win it
If you want my love, better win it
Wait a minute! Wait minute!

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
All these boys, I call them actors
Winning Oscars
They say they love us
But they actually imposters
Don't want no player
That's why I fired my roster
I told my man of the future
That he got to be
Be my Prince Charming
Kind of gentle, kind of ghetto
Don't want no man
That be softer than that Jello
Don't want no puppet
Cause my name ain't Gepetto
Want to win it? Treat me special!

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yo!
Ain't no speeding
Ain't no zoom zoom
You can take me on a date
Under the moon, moon
If we kiss, it's gon' later
Never soon, soon
You can get a Ukelele
Play my tune, tune
Play a sad song
You think I'm easy, huh
And now you mad, huh
You think I'm teasing, huh
But I ain't teasing you
No, I told you right from the start
If you roll with my love
You better win my heart

[Chorus]

Wait a minute!
