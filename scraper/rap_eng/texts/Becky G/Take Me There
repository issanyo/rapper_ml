[Chorus]
Ooh ooh baby, only you can take me there
Ooh ooh baby, only you can take me there
I'm faded cause your love is in the air
Ooh baby, only you can take me there
Can take me there, can take me there
I'm so high of your love, you are my only love
(Only you can take me there)

[Beat]

[Verse 1]
I think I'm addicted I need my prescription
Baby I'm feigning affection I need it
I don't roll up but I [?] up to where you need it
Don't pour up but I show up to get my fix
[?] all of you, breathing in all of you
Inhale, exhale
So high of you
Don't need no judge
High of your touch

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh baby, only you can take me there
Ooh ooh baby, only you can take me there
I'm faded cause your love is in the air
Ooh baby, only you can take me there
Can take me there, can take me there
I'm so high of your love, you are my only love
(Only you can take me there)
