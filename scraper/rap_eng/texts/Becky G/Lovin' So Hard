[Verse 1]
You're the one I wanna talk about, talk about
Had a few but you knock em out, knock em out
Might just let you meet my mama now, mama now
Might just let you lock it, lock it down
Cause I've been loving how you are with me, are with me
Ain't no fussing ain't no arguing, arguing
Every plane needs a pilot, pilot
Tell me baby who you're flying with?

[Hook]
Like ooh ah
Wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking breaking  all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard

[Chorus]
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be loving hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
I miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be loving hard

[Verse 2]
Tryna find, find the words to say, words to say
To describe what you mean to me, mean to me
Side by side like a yin and yang, yin and yang
Like to stay up to my Lil' Wayne
And it be hard, it be hard at times
But in the dark boy you are my light, are my light
The boom boom to my dynamite, dynamite
Baby you, you my ride or die

[Hook]
Like ooh ah, wanna, wanna be around you
Got me breaking, breaking all of my rules, oh
It's all the little things that you do
They got me like ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard
When I wake up
You're the first thing that comes to mind
Wanna see you like all the time
Yeah we be loving so hard

[Chorus]
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be loving hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
I miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be loving hard

We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
Ain't nobody love him like I love him
Ain't nobody steal him
Damn we be loving hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
We be loving, we be loving so hard
I miss him when I'm holding him
Miss him when I'm kissing him
Damn we be loving hard
