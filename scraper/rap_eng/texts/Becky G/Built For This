[Verse 1]
I'm-I'm so-so hypnotized
Open the days mesmorized
I'm tryna vizulize
You right now keep it cool right now
I like to be optiminstic
You and me, that's futristic
We can fly highlike a spaceship
Zoom right now to the moon right now

[Chorus]
You want me all alone (yeah I heard that before)
But first i gotta know (gotta know if your insecure)
Can you take control (tell me baby can you read my lips)
Boy I gotta know
I wanna know if your built for this
Built for this
Built for this
I wanna know if your built for this
I wanna know if your built for this

[Verse 2]
Too fly for ya' have to go
So cold like a popsicle
Row deep when we at the show
Guest list Becky G plus Mexico
You don't know what you do to me
Got me acting all stupidly
And from my love I speck truthfully
And the world full of lies you the truth to me

[Chorus]
You want me all alone (yeah, I heard that before)
But first I gotta know (gotta know if your insecure)
Can you take control (tell me baby can you read my lips)
Boy I gotta know
I wanna know if your built for this
Built for this
Built for this
I wanna know if your built for this
I wanna know if your built for this

[Bridge]
(built for this, built for this, built for this, built for this, built for this, built for this...)
I wanna know if your built for this
I wanna know if your built for this

[Chorus]
You want me all alone
But first I gotta know
Can you take control
Boy I gotta know
I wanna know if your built for this
Built for this
Built for this
I wanna know if your built for this
I wanna know if your built for this
