[Intro]
Hello?
Hey, yeah I just
I don't know

[Verse 1]
So much and I liked it
I did so much for you yet
You took it all for granted
But you know what? Forget that
You left me for 2 months, then decided to come back
But now I'm doing my own thing, now I bet you regret that

[Chorus]
I've moved on, I got a new plan now
I gave my best and you just sat around
I've moved on, I got a new plan now
I gave my best and you just sat around

[Verse 2]
Tell me, who you think you are?
Claiming you a star
I put in all the work for us to come this far
Claiming all the credit but you couldn't just admit it but I'm saying just forget it 'cause all of this is bizarre
I know what we had was fun but it's all because you changed, there was no love and it was enough for me to see you
But there's no helping
No, I can't explain it
No need for yelling
Just stop complaining
That's how you did, kept writing on my bed
So don't say a word, 'cause you know it's a fact
I've been taken for granted and that's for sure
I've been taken for granted but no more

[Chorus]
I've moved on, I got a new plan now
I gave my best and you just sat around
I've moved on I got a new plan now
I gave my best and you just sat around
