[Chorus: Black O]
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it

[Verse 1: Black O]
I heard they want that trap shit so I'ma give 'em facts
Niggas lie, bitches lie, but my scale never did that
I been up since seven thirty runnin' through a ten pack
Tryna get 'em to send another ten so I can wholesale that
The plug love me
Every time we link up he greet the kid with some bubbly
Twenty pounds of kush it's coming in this Sunday
Early monday morning, meetings talkin' 'bout them onions
Meet again on hump day, think I want Benihanas
Ruth Criss steaks got a nigga feelin' great
Liftin' all these pounds, you can say I'm a heavyweight
I ain't never have shit so I'ma grab me a big boy plate
I'm thinking lobster made to go along with the steak

[Chorus: Black O]
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Scooter I'm a dope boy, somethin' like Bambino
Every day I gamble with my life like a casino
Every day we juggin', I be posted in the trap
I got certified shooters, they do walkups, they don't rap
Large bag, countin' cash, I got bags
Paper tags, I got 'em mad, I paid cash
Twenty east, road runner, Colombia
I don't know your face, oh no I ain't servin' ya
I'm a certified trapper, I got rich off rap though
I got the recipe to make a mil out your trap bro
Lil Mexico, all we do is trap trap
I don't rubber band my money, I use saran wrap

[Chorus: Black O]
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it
I heard they want that trap shit so we gon' give it to 'em
They ask me was it rap money, I told 'em it's hood influenced
Yeah I be in the trap bitch, straight gettin' to it
Bust 'em down and bag 'em up, you know how we be doin' it
