[Intro: Ralo]
Yeah
FamGoon, yeah

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been takin' trips, them niggas trippin' (Yeah)
When niggas gettin' killed, we do the killin' (Yeah)
Ain't no need for you to ask me how I'm feelin' (No)
I turned my last six racks into some millions (Yeah)
Don't ask me how I'm feelin', this shit is feelin' too great (Yeah)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late (No)
I couldn't get engaged, won't be workin' minimum wage (No)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late
It ain't never too late

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
It ain't never too late to make a million dollars (Count up)
I'm good, love, you can enjoy them broke nigga problems
I'm rich now, not minimum wage for them petty dollars
No doubt about it, you know money solve all problems
It's too late to be real, you fake like all your partners
I ain't have to sign no deal to get my name poppin' (Street)
Yeah, it's too late if you talk 'bout that body
You just fucked it up for everybody, now niggas doin' life about it
Ain't no games in the streets, you get swallowed
Just put bricks in a suit and tie like a model
Fuck the law, Freebandz the only thing I follow
Everybody tell the judge to free Ralo

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been takin' trips, them niggas trippin' (Yeah)
When niggas gettin' killed, we do the killin' (Yeah)
Ain't no need for you to ask me how I'm feelin' (No)
I turned my last six racks into some millions (Yeah)
Don't ask me how I'm feelin', this shit is feelin' too great (Yeah)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late (No)
I couldn't get engaged, won't be workin' minimum wage (No)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late
It ain't never too late

[Verse 2: Ralo]
It ain't never too late
I was made to be great, God ain't make no mistake
I done gave so much that they wanna come take away (Yeah)
No matter what I do, they always havin' somethin' to say (Damn)
I ain't run away, I ain't run away (Nah, no)
I'm still out here doin' shit that can't be done today
Big B say he the last of that, but I'm the last of it (That, yeah)
You know I'm havin' it (Yeah), you know I'm havin' this shit, yeah
Let me tell you somethin' real quick, you gotta listen to me (Listen)
I ain't never paid a bitch to try to get some pussy (Nah)
I ain't never tucked my tail, I ain't never called on 12 (Nah, no)
I ain't never asked for help, I always did it by myself

[Chorus: Ralo]
We been takin' trips, them niggas trippin' (Yeah)
When niggas gettin' killed, we do the killin' (Yeah)
Ain't no need for you to ask me how I'm feelin' (No)
I turned my last six racks into some millions (Yeah)
Don't ask me how I'm feelin', this shit is feelin' too great (Yeah)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late (No)
I couldn't get engaged, won't be workin' minimum wage (No)
I tell 'em every day that this shit ain't never too late
It ain't never too late (Nope)
