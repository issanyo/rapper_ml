[Intro: Young Scooter]
Ayy Twaun, turn that beat down, haha

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Me and my boss bitch, we makin' moves (We makin' moves)
Finesse a nigga quick, that's what she do (Finesse)
Me and my boss bitch, we countin' up checks (Count up)
Sheisty bitch, she'll steal that chain from 'round your neck (Yeah)
Jugg queen, my lil' bitch, she act a fool (She act a fool)
Road runnin', I had to take that bitch to Skoob (Road runner)
Vacuum seal a half a million, that's how we move (Yeah)
She super gutter, rob a nigga without a tool

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
My bitch a criminal like Mike, yeah, she smooth (Yeah, she smooth)
In the streets it ain't no motherfuckin' rules
Real talk, you know that money overrule
How to traffic bricks, I took her ass to school (Traffic bricks)
If you listen to what I say then we can't lose (Nah)
She went from Air Max to three thousand dollar shoes (True story)
Lick over a ticket, that's the only way I move (Count up)
My bitch explicit, that's with everything she do (Finesse)
I need a boss bitch, bad bitch (Bad bitch)
I'm runnin' from broke bitches (Runnin' from broke bitches)
Shittin' on my ex bitch, gettin' rich with real niggas (Yeah)
Allergic to broke niggas (Broke), life ain't a joke, nigga
Pussy nigga piss me off, I let his ho work the door, nigga (Street)

[Verse 2: Karlae]
Okay, Karlae, yeah

Big pockets on me, bitch, I'm precious (Yeah)
Flawless diamond my necklace (Yeah)
