The streets on life support
The streets on life support

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Been jumped off the porch, lost some case in court
Fucked up police report, my lawyer knew what's up
They cross my name up, they tied me in with bra
Fuck every law they ever made, this world is fucked up
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
You know I got it handled
I know a lot of niggas snitchin'
But I'm still gamblin'

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I ain't goin' to court, I hate airports
You niggas workin' backwards
You ain't jumped off the porch
I'm really plugged in, I had to pass a torch
I let my niggas shine, enough money for all of us
Put away them foreign cars and buy the tour bus
All my niggas know I got them and Scooter they trust
I love my little daughter but these hoes I can't trust
You ain't bulletproof, anybody can be touched
Yeah, salute y'all niggas still on that corner
Casino say he know who want it
I done pushed more dope than Pusha T
Real dope boys, when they cook
They dope, you know they think of me

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Been jumped off the porch, lost some case in court

The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
You know I got it handled
I know a lot of niggas snitchin'
But I'm still gamblin'

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Aye, goin' on a date with my bitch, Nina
And me and Nina ridin' in my old Regal
A nigga can’t denim shoppin' at the D mall
Hair in a ponytail, Steven Seagal
Karate chop a brick, watchin' Sports Center
Gettin' head by the sink, stick a fork in her
Sharkskin suit on a helicopter
Land that bitch on the roof, serve everybody lobster
Lizard on my feet, hurt my big toe
Rest in peace Johnny A.K.A. Puerto Rico
Double D licked on the dice at my studio
But I can’t get it back cause he ain’t here no more

[Hook: Young Scooter]

The streets on life support

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I was on trial for traffickin' in 2010
Got caught on them back streets with 20 pounds of mid
But they ain't turned it all in, only turned 10
I told the judge I had 20 case dismissed

Ya own lawyer’ll try to play you
That’s how the system is
But it’s a Black Migo World, fuck who you with
50,000 every month, that's just on bills
20 apartments in the bricks house up on the hill
Undefeated with beating cases until I went to Ohio
And nobody ain't said shit
Police, they went and hired me
They tied me to (?), (?)
That left three niggas left
But they just started squealin'

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Been jumped off the porch, lost some case in court

The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
The streets on life support
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
You know I got it handled
I know a lot of niggas snitchin'
But I'm still gamblin'
