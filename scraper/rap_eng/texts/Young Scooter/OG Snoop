[Chorus]
I'm talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew
Talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew

[Verse 1]
Rollin' down the street, juggin', smokin', smokin' on that OG Snoop
Maybach, with my mind on my money and my hand on my nine
Later on that day, my partner hit me from the bay
An extra fifty K, he say he get 'em to the A
I told him send the bitches right away
Spook used to use the gin to stretch the yay
The four L get you stretched today
Rollin' down the street, smokin' out ounces
Servin' niggas pounds out the coupe
Maybach, with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew
Talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' but a G thing baby
Can't trust these hoes 'cause they shady
Scooter can you buy me, bitch you must be crazy
Bitch I'm bossed up, my ice game crazy
Swervin', flexin', in the coupe
Ridin' to that OG Snoop
Rollin' up that OG Snoop
Your bitch she a prostitute
I do what you rappers do
I got a million dollar crew
Scooter got on ten chains
And I got four watches too
Rollin' down the street feelin' like 2Pac
Bitch you know I got the juice
Maybach, with my mind on my money and my hand on my nine

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew
Talkin' pineapple Ciroc and pineapple juice
They still on that gin and juice, that's what them OG's do
I'm just riding in the coupe playin' that OG Snoop
A hundred bottles of Ciroc, I bought that shit for the crew
