[Hook: Young Thug]
Count it up with my boys
Ran it up with my boys
Whip bandanas with my boys
East Atlanta them my boys
Buy purple for my boys
Pass squirters to my boys
Young Scooter be my woadie
And I'm not from Magnolia
But I fuck her with my boys
I mingle with my boys
I'm living with my boys
And I can tell you I know it
I can tell, I swear to God
I can tell

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
If you ain't my boy
You need to get the fuck from 'round here
Don't need you in my presence, nigga
I can tell who you is
Thugger, that's my boy
You witness me fuck up a whole mill
Street money, nigga, I ain't got no fucking record deal
Leaning like a fool, point punched [?]  from doctor Phil
Take a good look at my ice, it's all real
Took a look back at my life
Don't know how I live
I let my boy, D.D., by street, you know he kill

[Hook: Young Thug]
Count it up with my boys
Ran it up with my boys
Whip bandanas with my boys
East Atlanta them my boys
Buy purple for my boys
Pass squirters to my boys
Young Scooter be my woadie
And I'm not from Magnolia
But I fuck her with my boys
I mingle with my boys
I'm living with my boys
And I can tell you I know it
I can tell, I swear to God
I can tell

[Verse 2: VL Deck]
I went  with the same niggas from day one
And the loyalty over royalty, we don't care about that
Birds don't fly for the flocking, yo
Every right or wrong, we be still whatever
That B.M.G. shit, I'm putting faces on stretchers
My nigga Young Scooter for neffa
Split pack with the ran, no presser
A lot of money in our pocket
Tell the bitch there is no pressure
Now, you can say what you want
But it look so we making all the noise
Two part shit, ain't making shit without my boys!

[Hook: Young Thug]
Count it up with my boys
Ran it up with my boys
Whip bandanas them my boys
East Atlanta with my boys
Buy purple for my boys
Pass squirters to my boys
Young Scooter be my woadie
And I'm not from Magnolia
But I fuck her with my boys
I mingle with my boys
I'm living with my boys
And I can tell you I know it
I can tell, I swear to God
I can tell

[Verse 3: K Blacka]
In my whole round, wammy, and my boys stop for me
The little pricks, they should think they cowboys how I fuck with them niggas
Hit a sissy for a half a zip, my boy have seven grams
Keep it real with you bruh, cut my heart with my right hand
Take a look, cause you are on hell's road now
I'm telling you, you can't trust no damn fool, so nigga
You been black, no bitch, never been no bitch
If they fuck with you, boy, I unload every stick

[Hook: Young Thug]

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Skeeted up with my niggas
Get richer with my niggas
Fishscale fishes for dinner
Balenciagas the winners
Sing a rhythm with my nigga, with your bitch on a crystal
She caught him leaving with club and blowed it like whistles
I won't hurt nobody
All my niggas rocking like a cut out stocking
Screaming free Pibb, no rocket
I wan't all the choppas
Came up with my nigga Willie
Stay gone you fuck niggas
You ain't my bro, you a fuck nigga

[Hook: Young Thug]
Count it up with my boys
