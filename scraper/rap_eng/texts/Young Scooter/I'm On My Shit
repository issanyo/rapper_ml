[Intro: Young Scooter & Future]
Yeah nigga!
You already know I’m on my shit nigga
The streets crazy right now
Huh, what the fuck you gonna do?
Swamp Mutha’fuckin Izzo! (count up)

[Verse 1]
Fuck, fuck the police cause they playing it dirty (yeah)
Locked up my whole clique, shit got me hurting (dirty)
I told plug, “You know I got you nigga if it cost a mill.” (a ticket)
I’mma get my whole clique out; I put that on my kid (I got ya)
My lil cousin up, got a fifteen, paying for his appeal (you good)
Plus, I’m doing this all with no record deal (street running)
A couple of years ago I was in the county cuffs (the county jail)
Now I’m pulling up with bails on dump trucks (bricks, bricks)
If you’re turned down, nigga I can turn you up (turn you up)
I drop my price everyday, nigga I don’t give a fuck! (jugg)
Everyday I’m making plays; eating bands for lunch (Freebandz)
The motor in the back; the trunk in the front (foreign)
My momma told me, “Son, you’re gambling with your life. (damn)
Leave the streets alone, shit ain’t right!
Your chances in the street just like shootin dice
At 7-Eleven nigga, you could lose your life!”

[Interlude]
Yeah nigga!
You better stay on your mutha’fucking shit in the street nigga
You already know Young Scooter nigga
I’m on my mutha’fucking street shit right now
...Count up!

[Verse 2]
The streets look at me now; I came a long way
From a three grand hundred, to them trucks of yay
I got so much money, I give that shit away
Bosses eat steak; you’re eating on paper plates
I just talked to my lawyer; I just beat a case
That’s good luck for the streets, I drop the price of yay
I’m plug-talking; I switch up numbers everyday
Every nigga around me is getting paid...
Freebandz, that’s that shit a nigga like
How you want your dough nigga: tan or white?
I get them on a boat, nigga overnight
Red, white, and blue, I’m about to take flight!
