[Hook 2x]
I see a lot of rappers wearing fake gold
I ain't wear Versace jewelry no more
Black Migo Scooter got a gold stove
I got 10 chains and they real gold

[Verse 1: Plies]
I just bought a Cuban, it was 7 kilos
Nigga try me, I'mma be where Hennessy go
I ain't scared of goin' broke bitch, I gotta a four
I ain't scared of jail bitch, cuz money talk
I don't take you serious with yo rappin' ass
I take yo chain and yo chopper , man you [?]
They say real niggas do a real thang
Tthat's probably why a real nigga got a real chain

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Fake chains turn a nigga neck green
Young Scooter; I'm a human money machine
How the fuck you real and your chain fake? (and your chain fake)
Why the fuck you wear your jewelry to your court date? (to your court date)
Right before this rap shit, the streets set me straight
I always kept it real with my nigga [?]
Took it round the city, me and Money Make
Black Migo Gang, we some paper chase
