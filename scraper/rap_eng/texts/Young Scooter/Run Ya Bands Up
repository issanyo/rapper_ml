[Hook:Young Scooter]
I live a dope boy life
When you're hustling some days you can't get right 2x
Run your bands up, run your bands up
Run your bands up, run your bands up
Run your bands up, run your bands up
Run your bands up, run your bands up

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I'm a bad chemist, I work bands up
You a dope boy, hold your hands up
You never saw a break, get your grounds up
You're a bad bitch, run your bands up
Baking soda, I got rich up on the hammer
I'm the king of the streets, I got it handled
Counting, counting checks, get your camera
All I do is flix, they can't stand it
Street certified, I don't rap lies
But I rap piles, I'm jugging over grind
Cross scooter and white chocolate talking homicide
The life I live got my family thinking I'm a die

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
You rapper don't respect me, do you like my nigga, Gucci?
A rapper don't respect me, than we gonna get to shoot
You niggas hating on me cause they can't fuck with Gucci
But jugg over quarter million last week with Gucci
I run my bands up and I don't run my friends up
About to change my rap game and leave my niggas plugged up
Cause we're running days with us, ain't nobody go fuck with us
All my partner loyal to me, nigga, in B and G we trust
Long as we're still breathing we gonna keeping getting the trunk
They put bands on my head but ain't nobody never trying the luck
No messing with co-cities on six, you know we're plugged up
I see some haters in this house, I tell them run their bands up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Bank Black]
OG, got bands from the old days
I remember I had dreams of a full way
Jugg it good, me and Ike on the four way
Everybody in the mob about that gunplay
Saw a nigga last week, he lost his whole face
Thirty murders in one year, they took the hood away
They're setting ducktape again, they try to build a case
I'm trying to serve these fucking packs above the pillowcase
Ain't got a come up for a nigga, pull up to the truck
Big Bank can't get caught up on a wild thing
If you're a real street nigga you understand that
Big Bank can't get caught up on a wild time

[Hook]
