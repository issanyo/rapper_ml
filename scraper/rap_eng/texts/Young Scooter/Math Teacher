[Hook: Young Scooter]
I got more money than my math teacher
I got more money than my math teacher
I got more money than my math teacher
I got more money than my math teacher
I'm in math class with 20 bandz
I'm in math class with 20 bandz
I got more money than my math teacher
I got more money than my math teacher

[Verse 1: Lil Mouse]
I just drove a Bentley, skurrt
Now they talkin' bout homeschool
I'm in math class on Instagram
My teacher hate 'cuz I got hella bandz
All of the young girls love Lil Mouse
15 with my own house
The stuff I seen I can't talk about
Yeah I bought 50 racks to school and they kicked me out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I'm from the streets but I finished school
Pull up to college, drop-top Bentley Coupe
It's winter time and I don't need no roof
I broke the rules and they kicked me out
50 Freebandz on me, flexin', pockets sticking out
I'm in math class countin' hundreds
Lil Mouse and Scooter worth a lot of money

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Mouse]
20 bandz in my front pocket
Got so much money I don't need a wallet
Pull up in Beams that are worth high schools
The latest 'Rari I'm a badass when I get the colors
When I'm in class a lot of money on me
Got tired of 50s, a lot of 100s on me
I'm a young flexer, keep a lot of money
Everytime I got a show, I be throwin' money
