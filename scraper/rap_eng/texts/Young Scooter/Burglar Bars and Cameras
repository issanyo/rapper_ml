[Chorus]
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
I can make the trap jump when the trap slow
Packs comin' in the front, right out the back door
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas

[Verse 1]
Brick thunderstorm, that's a cocaine shower
Thug and Future with me, you know that's the twin towers
I just sold a thousand pounds less than five hours
Road runnin' through your town, what you need? I got it
Get your calculator out with Scooter on the beat
I get them pounds for thirteen hundred and sell 'em for the three
I made more than the plug, street lottery
Jugg king, I just did a show for a key
I got six jugg houses on the same street
I got six plugs and they ain't got the same weed
You call your  partner big dog, he won't even let you eat
I get on every beat nigga and rap a recipe, Scooter

[Chorus]
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
I can make the trap jump when the trap slow
Packs comin' in the front, right out the back door
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas

[Verse 2]
I got the keys, the keys
Remix for twenty-three
Rolex off jugg houses
And everything for cheap
Still juggin' off public housing
Like eighty racks a week
Stash house in Stone Mountain
That I don't never see
Never let a nigga know when your pack comin'
'Cause niggas come and intercept that pack like Josh Norman
A half a million worth of cars and everything foreign
They dropped the price of bricks nigga and I'm to blame for it
Eleven hundred gram bricks, they cost an extra stack
Turn a nine to a half, an extra nine on top of that
Hit the club and buy the bar, you know we stand on top of that
Bitch I'm always in the streets, I out here where the robbers at

[Chorus]
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
I can make the trap jump when the trap slow
Packs comin' in the front, ran out the back door
Burglar bars and cameras, baking soda and Arm & Hammer
Black Amigo numbers got the trap goin' bananas
