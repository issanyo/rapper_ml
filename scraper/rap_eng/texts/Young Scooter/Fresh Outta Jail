[Intro: Young Scooter]
Fuck the judge (fuck him)
County jail (fuck em)
The prosecutor
I’m out of that bitch
Young Scooter!

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Fresh up outta jail, fresh up outta jail
I got clientele, still got bricks and bales
Fresh up outta jail, ready to make a sale
I could eyeball a brick and I don’t need a scale

[Verse: Young Scooter]
7 months locked in, long time comin'
With these fake ass lawyers spent a lot of money
20 thousand for a show, I lost a lot of money (that’s a lot of money)
I could buy a nigga’s ho with this dope money
I’mma buy some bricks from Hector with my show money
Fresh up outta jail with my own money
And been out 5 days, made 400
He used to be my partner but he told on me
Scooter outta jail, niggas lookin' pale
Lookin' at me stupid like I’mma stay in jail
I violate my probation – they talkin' 4 years
I got a whole lot of paper, this what it is

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Walk you the jail house into the drug house
These black amigo prices turn traps out
Turn your pockets up, light yo' bands up
I know Columbians who got dump trucks
The last 7 months the streets been turned down
Shit been slow as hell, can’t get off no pounds
Scooter back around, prices back to normal
Move low key, that’s informer
I’m fresh up outta jail, I can’t even sleep
I’ve been up a week, grab that team a street
500 for a plate when I sit down to eat
Yea ruthless, where the bosses be

[Hook x2]
