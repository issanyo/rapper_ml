Fuck serving this nigga let's take him out
We only sell clean dope, let's take half out
I just left a Bentley [?] and I drove off
And you know my diamonds shine even when the lights off
I turn the streets on, I turn the streets on

Take his ass off
A thousand pounds a day, nigga I get it on
We talking 'bout some business, turn your phone on
