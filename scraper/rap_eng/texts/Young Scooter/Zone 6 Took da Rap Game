[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Black Migo Gang nigga
Herion in this motherfucker
ATL Jacob
Freebandz Shit
You dig

[Verse 1]
Trappin' out Rudy's spot, just me and Dae Dae
I made a couple million out them project hallways
Everything I do is for the gang like the song say
They gave my little brother nine years like yesterday
Lost everything I had and got some bands from Bino
The day I walked up out that jail Future bought me a Benzo
Yeah I ran off on my migo, changed my name to Lorenzo
Everything I rap about is real talk, no pretendo
Lil Mexico City, that's where we at
I got a crazy jugg house right off the flat
You ain't seen your bitch, I got her driving packs (road runnin')
I don't fuck with 400 'cause he a rat (true story)
I'm good in fifty states, I got a million dollar face card
I don't make club music, nigga this for the dope boys
They know I want all the smoke so the feds took the cowboys
Blame it on my mama, bitch I grew up a wild boy

[Chorus]
Black Amigo Scooter, that's my name (street)
Real street nigga, fuck some rap fame
I'll never switch up on my niggas, I'll never change
Since Double died, a lot of shit ain't been the same (OG D)
I just blew two hundred thousand bettin' on games (count up)
You don't want no smoke, lil boy stay in your lane
All I want is free bands and cocaine (Freebandz)
Zone 6, we done took the rap game (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I don't play with hoes, I play with bricks
I got twenty hustles, that's how I got rich (jugg, jugg)
Made it through the struggle, now I'm flexin' yeah (flex)
Two to five on every outfit that I wear (racks)
More money, more problems
More problems, more money
Made a whole ticket on that Lac, me and Sunny (yeah)
Oh no I ain't money hungry nigga, I'm hungry for money
All this dope I rap about, I make the police horny (street)

[Chorus]
Black Amigo Scooter, that's my name (street)
Real street nigga, fuck some rap fame
I'll never switch up on my niggas, I'll never change
Since Double died, a lot of shit ain't been the same (OG D)
I just blew two hundred thousand bettin' on games (count up)
You don't want no smoke, lil boy stay in your lane
All I want is free bands and cocaine (Freebandz)
Zone 6, we done took the rap game (yeah)

[Outro]
I play with bricks
Jugg, jugg
Flex
Racks
Black Amigo Scooter, that's my name
(more problems, more money)
Real street nigga, fuck some rap fame, yeah
(I'm hungry for money)
Since Double died, a lot of shit ain't been the same (street)
