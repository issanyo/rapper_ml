[Hook: Young Scooter]
Drugs, everybody on drugs
Had a dose of Miley Cyrus then I fell in love
Drugs, I made my own drug, don't need no plug
Your partner go Hollywood, act like he on drugs
Drugs, drugs, make you turn up in the club
Drugs, drugs, raise your middle fingers up
Drugs, drugs, no I ain't on every drug
Drugs, drugs, will make you fuck some millions up

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I don't know nothing bout no love
But I mastermind these drugs (real dope boy)
I own my own drug hub (lil mexico)
If I ain't gettin' paid then I don't go to clubs
Grind, juug, keep that money up
I fuck with Mike Will, but Miley I'm in love
Pour a pint in a 2 liter, drinking mud
Walking through the mall smoking, I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I ain't no rapper I'm a talking drug
Million dollar drug habits, niggas can't afford
With my juug money, nigga I can make the Forbes
I built my name off drug money real dope boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I be Young Thugger but the molly talkin'
Everybody around me baby D like Walters
Aha, I'm having bricks I keep 'em fresh like coffees
Ha ha, ha ha, wake up high, cloud 9, ain't never walking
Drugs, D R U G S
I got 50, you got 50, let's have a contest
I don't need no gun but if you steal you end up armless
Street cook so much I done got hooked on like phonics
I sold them drugs and bought a Audi for my mom
Put up the hundreds with the painted on designers
I chuck that pack, like Walter Payton I start running
I'm on so many drugs right now this shit ain't funny
My plug gon' keep em coming
