All I'm thinking, get my Grandma off that dirt road
All I know is getting all my niggas out the hole
My partner got a L, still juugin down the road
I got clientele and I juug without a phone
I got Truck Loads (x4)
I got hot stoves, tan dope
It was water whipped, I hit it wit the coca cola

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Word on the street: Young Scooter signed to Gucci
Word on the street: Young Scooter signed to Future
Word on the street: What the fuck is Scooter doing?
Giving ya street knowledge from every angle, I been through it
I drop a album, 5 dollars off a CD
You used to be a boss, now you hood memories
All year round I just juug christmas trees
My partner got a plug but he really wanna fuck with me
They took a loss gambling, trying to play them backstreets
He know I'm a roadrunner, run them packs like track meets
I could get 'em to you though its gone cost a tax fee
Give me a million dollars, you'll see three trucks a week

[Verse 2:]
I got truck loads, I got truck loads
Expressways, over-sized loads
I got juug houses, with no doors
Every room in it got a gold stove
Fucked the plug money up, I bought it for my grandma
I paid him back and re'd-up, now I'm answering the phone for her
Every truckstop in my city, yeah, I own all of em
Every real nigga in Atlanta, yeah, I know all of em
I got truck loads, I make 4-4s
What you need nigga? Thats a 10-4
I got plug numbers, boy your trap's slow
Truck loads: free bankrolls
