[Verse 1: Marco]
Shout out to my essay, man that nigga from Spain
All these niggas hating on me can we keep a lot of money
Man we stunting on these niggas so hard, pulling up in the whip
Foreign whip we pull up
And we all way take a trip
Flying away from Mexico
My essay got it planned out
He send em bag I send em cash, everybody got their hands out
I shipped it all (x2)
We sell it all, wholesale
Y'all niggas sit on the work, I see why you can't sell

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Got 36 o's, truck full of bricks
Black Amigo gang got plug prices
Free Mario
94 bitch
Real dope boy locked up cuz a nigga snitch
You know I know essay
That essay he bring mocha
Its gon' cost you more if I bring that thang to Florida
Cuz I don't trust my lawyer
This whole world is loyal
These plugs still in [?]
In [?]
Everyday a payday
Count up with my essay
And we count up profit
I know the police watching
My essay got me topless
The whole neighborhood shopping
You want some swag then get it
You want some bricks then count it
