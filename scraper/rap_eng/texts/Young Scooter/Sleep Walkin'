[Intro: Gucci Mane]
What’s happening?
It’s Guwop!
I got these niggas, niggas with me
Turn up!

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I’m daydreaming, thinkin bout a million
Tryna run my bands, taller than the ceiling
James Brown, bout that money I got the feeling
That I make a lot of money, they wanna kill me
Now I’m sleep talkin, geeked up off that bitch molly
Now I’m sleep countin, thumb through a half a million $
In the club, fell asleep, 100 in my pocket
Keep some shooters with me and I know the robbers watching
I’m a taker, they ain’t never took shit out my body
Except that nigga hitter, I could say he got me
I’m just playin with yo brain, nigga don’t believe it
You know that was a throw nigga when I was dreaming

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]
Sleep talkin, talkin in my damn sleep
Sleep walkin, trippin over my damn feet
Sweet talkin, sweep her off her damn feet
She say she lost, she can’t find herself

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Talk about a ?, Im a fool with the paper
I could point at you, see every move on surveillance
Boy I’m getting Kd up, bad bitch pimp with me
Like they from Decatur, I could never hate you
Zone 6 neighbors, zone 6 raised me
Riding round in the Dually, zone 6 school me
With the Mac there like Gucci
I was skippin school, on the back steps makin movies
Rest in peace to Lil Ant, my nigga was the coolest (rest in peace)
When he died, I cried forreal
I’m sleep walkin like a motherfucker, you don’t know how Shawty feel
Keep going hard like a motherfucker
We'll throw up 30 bills
And I’m real, and I’m here
Call Gucci for the kill

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]
Sleep talkin, talkin in my damn sleep
Sleep walkin, trippin over my damn feet
Sweet talkin, sweep her off her damn feet
She say she lost, she can’t find herself

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Woke up with yo baby mama, what the fuck?
I used to run with yo baby brother, I gives a fuck
And yo big sister catchin nothing, yea she a slut
Woke up or I am asleep on South Beach
I’m sippin mud, I’m smoking gas, I got it bad
Sleep walkin my day job and this bitch keep out those dollars cash
Keep touring, I took your girl to dinner – it was boring
She was gorgeous but baby got er thinkin I was snoring
I’m in Europe, I’m sippin syrup
I’m in the foreign, it’s zone 6’s 5 o’clock but here it’s like it’s morning
Yea we ballin, we ball so hard that all my niggas know
I sleep with cold chick cuz I’m a sleepwalker, this a warning

[Hook x2: Gucci Mane]
Sleep talkin, talkin in my damn sleep
Sleep walkin, trippin over my damn feet
Sweet talkin, sweep her off her damn feet
She say she lost, she can’t find herself

I’ll show you baby
