[Intro: Young Scooter]
Free bricks two nigga
Aye Gucci we 'bout to finesse the world nigga
Count up!

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
On everything the streets'll never be the same
Petty niggas snitchin' just for pocket change
I rearranged the game and built my own lane
I'm all about the money, motherfuck the fame
I came up wit' a hustle, made myself a star
I was 20-years-old wit' 3 foreign cars
Lighthouse, $200,000 worth of real diamonds
Wasn't in the rap game, in the streets grindin'
Scooter took off and they don't like that
You think they should, you tell the folks the day I sold you that
But I ain't showed you nothin', I juuged you out a sack
From San Diego to Atlanta I got flying packs

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
R.I.P. to my old whips, all my cars got pink slips
Still shoppin' at Saks Fifths cause she eat a dick like rib tips
Takin' hoes on field trips, do you know how packed LIV get?
All my hoes Sicilian, vacuum-sealed the millions
I got money, I sold dummies
I miss Lonny, ain't shit funny
10 youngins wit' 10 Tommys and niggas can't take shit from me
Cut-throat - I'm dishonest, try me and you get punished
Kick do' yo' bitch runnin', you get cunnin', I get gunnin'
Back down from no one, got one and I got one
Take one to know one, get shot down from my shotgun
Amigos we trick those, kilos we miss those
Robin Hood of the six, I got Free Bricks for my kinfolk

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick
Free bricks, free bricks
Serve ya wit' one eye open, Slick Rick
Free bricks, free bricks
Young Scooter, Gucci Mane talking real slick
