[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Yeah, Quay cook that shit up, nigga
Pablo Juan cook that shit up, nigga
Hood

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Roll up the dope (Roll it up), gold on my rope (Gold on my rope)
Gotta stay in school, young nigga, get hope (Stay in school, lil' nigga)
Go get that money then fuck on your ho (Go get that money and fuck on your ho)
Take off the plug, it don't go for the low (Take off the plug, give me that)
Pint come sealed, I just poured up a four (Pint sealed up, pour up)
Fuck your career, I got money to blow (Fuck your career, lil' nigga)
Rich in the hood, I got bricks of the coke (I'm rich in the hood, Hoodrich)
I ain't gotta tell 'em shit, they already know (They already know what's goin' on)
Really in the trap, this ain't no fairytale (I'm in the trap for real)
Bricks and bales, I keep breakin' my scale (Bricks and the bales)
I cook with the mask, I can't stand the smell (Woo, cook it up)
If you get locked up, nigga, I know you 'gon tell (Pussy)
My shooters they ready, I pay 'em well (My shooters, they ready)
Let my young niggas go catch it and make a sale (My young niggas catch it)
Babies and baby bottles, it's a daycare (Babies and bottles)
Trap out the house, bitch, you know we don't stay there (You know we don't stay there)

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Come to the trap, have your money ready
I'm cookin' it in the pot like it's spaghetti (Cookin')
Havin' raw dope, nigga this shit deadly (Raw dope)
Three choppers with me like Ed, Edd n Eddy (Three choppers)
I just want nothin' but the fetty, them pesos (I just want money)
Dope good like they was tastin' the rainbow (Dope too good)
Don't give no fuck, I'ma fuck on your main ho (Fuck on that ho)
Bad lil' foreign bitch, I think she albino (I think she foreign)
I done got rich but I'm still on the same road (Candler Road)
Workin' two burners, whip the pot, the Django (Two pots)
Racks in my skinnies, addicted to bankrolls (Racks in my skinny jeans)
I know you wish you was a nigga, you ain't though (Know you wish you was a nigga)
Still in the trap, I ain't changed clothes (Still in the trap)
Try me, I guarantee you get your brains blowed (I'm killin', my nigga)
Give me that head and that pussy, no anal (Give me that head and that pussy)
Better have the pies, nigga, I sell it, case closed (Case)
One thing I never did is pay hoes (Never, uh-uh)
Can't pay attention to these niggas, they hoes (For real)
Go check my resume, I'm straight out the bowl (Check my resume, nigga)
Trappin' that dope, had to crawl out that hole (Trappin' that dope)
He started snitchin', we call him a mole (Snitch ass nigga)
Stuffin' them bricks in the back of the store (Stuff bricks)
Pablo the plug, bitch, don't ask what I sold (Pablo the plug)
I jump in the foreign and roll up the dope (Jump in that foreign, I'm gone)

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Roll up the dope, gold on my rope
Gotta stay in school young nigga, get hoes
Go get that money and fuck on your ho
Take off the plug, it don't go for the low
Pint come sealed, I just poured up a four
Fuck your career, I got money to blow
Rich in the hood, I got bricks of the coke
I ain't gotta tell 'em shit, they already know
Really in the trap, this ain't no fairytale
Bricks and bales, I keep breaking my scale
I cook with the mask, I can't stand the smell
If you get locked up, nigga, I know you 'gon tell
My shooters they ready, I pay 'em well
Let my young niggas go catch it and make a sale
Babies and baby bottles, it's a daycare
Trap out the house, bitch, you know we don't stay there

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Young Scooter, Pablo Juan, and we making' plays like Pablo (Jugg)
Aston with the rose gold rims, and I got a Murci√©lago (Foreign)
We put the pounds on the road, and we put the bricks on the cargo (Yeah)
Anything I motherfuckin' say, I bet the street niggas follow (Street)
Free Ralo, spin a nigga's block with the fully-auto (Brrat)
I got all this water on, I might need goggles (Eliantte)
Pay the bitch extra if she swallow, fuckin' bad bitches, models (Models)
We go full throttle (Yeah), just popped five hundred bottles (Flex)
Me and Pablo Juan, we get bales out the foreign (Jugg)
I put the streets on curfew, I'm 'bout to set the alarm (For real)
No less than fifty racks, each watch I put on my arm (Count up)
All I rap about is dope 'cause that's the way I was born, street

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Roll up the dope, gold on my rope
Gotta stay in school young nigga, get hoes
Go get that money and fuck on your ho
Take off the plug, it don't go for the low
Pint come sealed, I just poured up a four
Fuck your career, I got money to blow
Rich in the hood, I got bricks of the coke
I ain't gotta tell 'em shit, they already know
Really in the trap, this ain't no fairytale
Bricks and bales, I keep breaking my scale
I cook with the mask, I can't stand the smell
If you get locked up, nigga, I know you 'gon tell
My shooters they ready, I pay 'em well
Let my young niggas go catch it and make a sale
Babies and baby bottles, it's a daycare
Trap out the house, bitch, you know we don't stay there
