[Hook]
When niggas see the light they leave you in the dark
When shit ain't going right who can you call on?
A couple of years ago I was sleeping in the dark
Now I got them Bentleys in my front yard
Everybody straight, Everybody straight
Everybody straight, Everybody straight
My whole hood straight, all my niggas straight
All my plugs straight, my whole family straight

[Verse 1]
Black Migo Gang that's the blueprint
Riding to that Jay-Z The Blueprint
You can't knock my hustle cus my rent due
Drought season put the streets on curfew
1017 that's my way in
FreeBandz, Scooter worth some more mills
Had to take off, now I fucked that up next year
I remix them every second in a minute
I can't sell this dope clean I gotta stretch it
Mention Future name I'll shoot you through your necklace
Mention Gucci, Flocka name your hood we wreckin'
Got them tickets me and tickets straight finessin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I wasn't straight in 2008
I was jammed up come back from my case
Come back for estate
Couldn't even leave the state
I had no place to stay
But now I'm super straight
Now it's iced-out Rollies
And Audemar Piguets
Quarter million dollar foreigns with no license plate
No more paper plates my kids eat off gold plates
No more ramen noodles all I wanna eat is steak
Attract a lot of haters cus I'm flexin' everyday
Grind harder, having flashbacks of my broke days
Plus I kept my mouth closed when them folks came
Never fold on my niggas take it to my grave

[Hook]
