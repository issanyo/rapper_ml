[Hook: Young Scooter] x2
It's nothing important than money
Them Franklin, them hundreds, them hundreds
It's nothing important than money
So we hustlin' and hustlin' and hustlin'

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
It's nothing more important than a dollar bill
Dirty money up in cocaine deals
I speak Guapanese to you if I know who you is
I'm all about the money, fuck how you feel
That molly got me thinking everybody's snitchin'
I'm used a stainless steel pyrex on the weekend
Any language spoke, nigga I could speak it
You don't know your plug, labels they'll try to cheat ya
So when I take a loss I don't think about it
I'll take your ass off and I won't think about it
Wake up in the morning wrap the bricks in loving
Me and Zaytoven, birds of the feathers

[Verse 2: Marco]
Ain't nothing important than money
I can't stack it if it ain't them hundreds
Cause anything [?]
Cause I remember I ain't had shit
Step on the floor and I ain't had no clothes
Recycled everything my brother wore
He was a thirty eight, I was a thirty four
I tied them bitches up and swagged out the door
But now I'm getting money, can't tell me shit
I'm always paper chasing, trying to make a flip
And I only do gas, I don't do the bricks
And I'm a cash out, you can't front me shit

[Verse 3: Kourtney Money]
Ain't nothing more important than money
What the fuck these niggas think, I don't love money?
Hundred thousand dollar profit on my own
I been out here in these streets, money been grown
But when I think about it when I don't have shit
Who could I call to get me some, that's the same shit
But I ain't even mad, I jsut learned my lesson
Get this money on these suckers, leave the suckers stressing
And when I think about it, yeah, it feel good
There be another rich nigga out my fucking hood
And yeah this crowd of bad niggas out here hating on me
But I just grab my F&N and keep you stained, homie
And that's money
