[Hook: Young Scooter]
Ain't been in my right mind
Cause all my niggas doing time
Ain't been in my right mind
These niggas trying to steal my shine
Ain't been in my right mind (x3)
Cause all my niggas doing time

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Lil' Newt, he just took a fire
I can't lie, that shit hurt me inside
My young nigga, that's my right to die
But he got caught up on isle 65
I know you worried about me. but I'm all good, nigga
I got Blacky with me and these little niggas
These shooters in the cliffs throw away, them real pussy
I got extended bricks on my bricks, got remix in them
All I know is Geo Grime
The trouble make you loose your mind
Don't I mind, you were never fine
Meet the plug at the state line

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Marco]
Ain't been in my right mind
Since Lil' Brook got time
One of the real niggas I know, taught me how to grind
And you a damn liar if you say, he ain't gay or nothin'
Gave me my first couple of thousand
Told me run it up
And I ain't look back
Bought a pack, made some rags
Now, why the good nigga gone, somebody tell me that
But I'm a still here
So I'm a go get me paid
Got a pour up everyday, so I can start thinking
Shit killing me, they ain't feeling me
I don't mind playing
And still gotta watch out for the snakes
So I'm a true scrapper
Push your shit, too bad
And a really tall pussy, ain't no flaw in that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
The fans want me for my past
I escape the streets with a bang
They know I still clocking out
50 thousand worth a shopping bag
We niggas still in swag
I ain't really worried about that
I'm a real young O.G. boss nigga
A lot of niggas man 'cause that
Red, white and blue flag
Get money, man that's Black amigo gang, nigga
In my hood we scream free Pimp
Squeaky 2, that's my little nephew
Free my cousin Quae 40
Shoot your ass with that Glock 40
