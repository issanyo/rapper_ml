[Intro]
Yeah
Naughty P
I’m in the mother f*ckin streets for real

[Hook]
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set
From a [?] I got a check I don’t need no respect
A couple bad pull a rat from where you at and shoot up the streets
How the f*ck you gone beef with no check
I let the bands do the talking for less it’s hot in the street
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set
For praying with street

[Verse 1]
I took a shot but ain’t nothing
Murder or hire they know it’s coming
And no fortys all my n*ggas drama
We shoot out high boxes and chill [?]
All I want is bricks and bells and comma’s
They smoke that OG cush from California
There’s so much drama in the streets I gotta take care of my problems
We got some beef and I don’t care cause I’m a shoot ya partner
It’s raining bullets it’s raining bullets
I green light you, black hood
Fifty on everybody on shooting I told you p*ssy n*gga not to f*ck with scooter

[Hook]
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set
From a [?] I got a check I don’t need no respect
How the f*ck you gone beef with no check
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set

[Verse 2]
VL Deck air fifteen with the fallback
Hope you n*ggas militant with your hard hat
Ten racks flat get you n*ggas block attack
And once they clean up the scene p*ssy we double back
Homicide that’s where we bite Jack bond money on retainers [?]
Cool and Keith on the top of the Cal Tech
Hit em with the fat Joe watch em lean back
Heard you n*ggas want war but you on the corner
Automatic weapons make it hard for the corner
Got my bands up going to war it’s my persona
With the HK dibs so gone need an organ donor

[Hook]
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set
From a [?] I got a check I don’t need no respect
How the f*ck you gone beef with no check
I let the bands do the talking for less
It’s hot in the streets
When it rain n*ggas get wet don’t make my n*ggas come and shoot up the set
