[Chorus: CBM Lil Daddy]
Breaking down them bows, serving halves and wholes
Breaking down them bales when I'm on the scale
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
Breaking down them bricks, stackin' 'em up in splits
Jugging real quick 'cause I do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit

[Verse 1: CBM Lil Daddy]
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit
Dimes and nicks, now a nigga moving bricks
Broke so many scales I can't even count
Bought a money counter just to count a stack
Jugged so many bands, I'm talkin' bout that gas
'93 Octane, got it selling fast (boomin', boomin')
Pulled so many tricks selling dummy bricks
Me and Scooter just pulled another trick
Jugg, jugg, jugg, that all I know
How could I go broke when I'm 'bout to blow?
Trappin' with the rap just like sellin' dope
Came from rocking coke, now I'm rocking shows

[Chorus: CBM Lil Daddy]
Breaking down them bows, serving halves and wholes
Breaking down them bales when I'm on the scale
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
Breaking down them bricks, stackin' 'em up in splits
Jugging real quick 'cause I do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I just sold twenty bricks in one day
Eight-five south, me and Doe B
Rest in peace to Doe, rest in peace to Doe
You buying more than twenty, I bring 'em to your door
We ain't selling nothing less than a half a brick
You outselling ass nigga, you just average
Yeah I'm shining like a light, look at my carats bitch
A hundred thousand in my pocket, I'm a walking lick
Cocaine hard like seashell, we got bricks on retail
We got bales on retail, swap 'em out and resale
Breaking down them bricks, cooking on the stove
Scooter fell in love with them white hoes

[Chorus: CBM Lil Daddy]
Breaking down them bows, serving halves and wholes
Breaking down them bales when I'm on the scale
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
I'm a trap nigga, I do this shit for real
Breaking down them bricks, stackin' 'em up in splits
Jugging real quick 'cause I do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit
I'ma a trap nigga, I really do this shit
