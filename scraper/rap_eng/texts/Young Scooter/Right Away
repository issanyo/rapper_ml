I can see you hating niggas
Mad that you broke, right away

[Verse 1 – Young Scooter]
All my life I hustle to see a better way
Mama we won’t sell dope, I need that money now, right away
Bricks instead of pounds, right away
I never turn you down, right away
They on me now, I see the Jakes
Gotta touch the grass just to see the snakes
Oh lord I just [?], oh lord Imma be forever [?]
Flipping on them dirty measures, balling out
Cribs I want a thousand, [?] nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Trav]
I just talked to Hector, I told him send them bricks right away
The police looking for me, so I had to fuck around and switch my face
I got dope money, I get em juuging right away
You hate to see me flexing, don’t make me shoot you in your face
Can’t switch my hustle, gotta make these juugs right away
The streets fucked up, can’t front these bricks you gotta pay
Cause everybody snitching, these street niggas turning state

[Hook]
