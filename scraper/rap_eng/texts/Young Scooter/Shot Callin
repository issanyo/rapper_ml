[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow

[Verse 1: Loso Loaded]
Yeah, I want ten for a show
You can catch me ballin' in the snow
I want ten for that verse, I put ten in her purse
And that's racks on racks on racks
I get it in, I get it first
And I'm smashing right down Collins
Drop the top down off that vert
Walkin' up on Loso Loaded, nigga playin' gon' get murked, yeah
I used to like her at first, I had to side-eye the bitch
Designer sneakers on my shelf, they done retired and shit
Lil nigga just look how we livin'
I'm nicklin' three, poppin' dimes and shit
These niggas be rappin', they really ain't real, they really be hidin' the shit
Lil nigga I came from the rats and the roaches and sleepin' on everybody's sofa
And now I flex up on a lil bitty bitch and I'm praying the codeine run over

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow

[Verse 2: Marlo]
I'm just big mobbing, flossing, sending hits, yeah I'm calling
Big boss, yeah I'm bossing, thirty bricks got me balling
I want 10K, thugs say it's 10K for a show
Water whipping in that bowl, Marlo loaded with the blow
Bad bitches snorting coke while I'm pouring up a four
With my bro, on the way to count some racks on racks on racks
I run my side and that's a known fact
These niggas talkin' gangster, time to act
Them young niggas goin' crazy over the cash
I give 'em the word and then them niggas blast
The Porsche 911 real fast
I copped the coupe, Givenchy on my ass
That young nigga with a big bag
That young nigga with a big bag

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I want ten for a verse but I want twenty for a show
Twenty-four hundred for the gas, twenty-nine for the blow
All my diamonds water, ice cold like an eskimo
Even when the lights off I'm lit up like a lightpole
9th Ward, Black Amigo, bitch we bomb first
My face card will get you pulled off in that black hearse
My nigga this ain't what you want, ain't talkin' Lil Durk
I ain't get rich off rap my nigga, I came up selling work
I just made a jugg milo, so I tweeted Marlo
I don't even drank but popped a hundred bottles
And ain't no half stuff my nigga, I'm goin' full throttle
I'm the jugg king, what I say the streets follow

[Chorus: Loso Loaded]
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow
I'm just big ballin', ballin', shot callin', do it often
And your bitch want me, and she steady jockin', steady callin'
I want 10K, I want 10K for a show
Thirty-six for a brick, catch me ballin' in the snow
