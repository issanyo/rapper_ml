[Intro]
Mexican drug cartels have developed an intricate network using cities like Atlanta as a major distribution hub, and bringing with them a brand of violence rarely seen this far away from the border. Federal authorities say it works like this: the drugs are moved in bulk across the Mexican border to hub cities like Atlanta, where it's broken down in warehouse, shipped to other cities, then broken down again and sold on the street. The cash goes back to the hub cities, where it's packaged and shipped back to cartel leaders in Mexico

[Verse]
Feds want me bad, they want me for my past
They calculated truckloads of bricks that I passed
Other pussy niggas, you know we jugg swag
I'm so turnt, niggas in my own hood mad
I want six figures, I paid like two-hundred for that shit
You play with me, you gon' get your neighborhood killed
Lil Mexico, look at our city we done built
We got drug laws, I'm the fuckin' president
I break bricks down nigga, remix 'em, put 'em back together
I break bricks down nigga, remix 'em, put 'em back together
I break bricks down nigga, remix 'em, put 'em back together
I break bricks down nigga, remix 'em, put 'em back together
