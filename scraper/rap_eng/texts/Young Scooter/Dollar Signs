(Chorus)
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs

(Verse)
Wake up in the morning, money on my mind
From the streets, you know I’m never on time
Bails and bricks, I got that all the time
Disrespect the streets, this shit will take your shine
You ever see Js on the lunch line
All my trap houses got open, son
I know some rap niggers that ain’t got a dime
Couldn’t take the pressure when it’s crush time
You rappin lies, you rappin lies
I read your contract and you ain’t make a dime
I made my contract, so all my money mine
The jugg hoe’s where I resign

(Chorus)
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs

(Verse)
See, we’re talking dollar signs, this what I do by two some
Anyone can’t hang around me unless you can shoot some
House plus money, that’s a pile cake
Tell ‘em got that f’ing thing, so don’t get pancake
Listen, in the clubs we’re on reload
And the kicks come from relo, never text a bitch, she in though
Remember the spot in pink city next to C bone
Everytime you look up, bitch, I get my cook up
We can put the eye down, get the pirate patch
Put the gun in the sense like you would shoot that bitch
Always buy, never renting
And murders this shit, yeah, you got a percentage
You know this

(Chorus)
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs

(Verse)
Look up in the sky, got it raining money
Don’t hold your ass down, you might miss something
I started as a boss, I never been around him
My daddy was on dope, my mama was a hustler
My little brother gone, I got all the custom
I can see it in your face that you ain’t got no money
Anybody get it when I rap it, dummy
Sex, money, murder, I salute my homies
But I don’t gang bang, I got this bigger on me
I know I look like money, don’t you run up on me
Dollar signs, dollar signs
It’s good to run six, man, it’s grind time

(Chorus)
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Dollar signs, dollar signs
Looking at the ground, seeing dollar signs
Look up in the sky, seeing dollar signs
