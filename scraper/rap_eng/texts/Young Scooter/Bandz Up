[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Runnin' through the checks, dodgin' penitentiary
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', tell 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up
I ain't worried 'bout them bitches, out here tryna get it
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', told 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
Cobblestone flex, tryna get it out the mud
After school traffic, me and CJ catchin' juggs
First pack of tasty, got it from my big cousin
Twelve years old, first started sellin' drugs
Mama couldn't hold my hand up so I had to man up
Pistol on my hip, can't pull my pants up
I bought my first zip, stacked all the grams up
Twelve hit the block, I hit the cut, I can't get jammed up
When I leave and come back, tryna flip somethin'
Tired of being broke, I need an income
Fell in love with money, tryna get some
Eviction notice when the rent come
Old niggas all in my business tryna tell me how to feed my children
Never had a soul for my witness
Ain't nobody help me do what I did

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Runnin' through the checks, dodgin' penitentiary
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', told 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up
I ain't worried 'bout them bitches, out here tryna get it
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', told 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
We doin' anything for profit
Rich Gang, BMFBG, you know my niggas got it, yeah
You niggas livin' in the past
And you know I keep Future with me, right now I'm in next year
You know I ran my bands up after cookin' grams up
And we all armed and dangerous
I got so much respect I could have a million cash on me
And a nigga ain't gon' play with it (count up)
A nigga cross the gang, they get Dirt Gang
Avianne, Elliante, I'm in love with diamond chains
I'm my own CEO, I own Black Amigo Gang (BMG)
I'm never goin' back to zero
Free draco, that's my hundred gangster (Scooter)

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Runnin' through the checks, dodgin' penitentiary
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', told 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up
I ain't worried 'bout them bitches, out here tryna get it
Do whatever just to run them bands up
Old niggas say I'm trippin', told 'em mind they business
Do whatever just to run them bands up, yeah yeah yeah
