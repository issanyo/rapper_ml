[Intro: Young Thug]
Tell me what you want
You want the money or the crumbs?
You want the beans or the crumbs?
You want (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Do you want a milly or the crumbs? (yeah)
Do you want the bread or the brumbs? (yeah)
Do you want to be wealthy or bum? (yeah yeah yeah, yeah), oh

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We come and take over your ward, like a STD (yeah yeah)
I got lights on me bling in the dark, like a LED (yeah yeah)
Lil shawty photogenic, she collagin' (yeah yeah)
We gon' spin the block with the carbon if you're dodgin' me (yeah yeah yeah)
All us hard body, shiny diamond watches (diamonds hard body)
Chinese kitty cat, yeah, make it hard to not (oh oh oh)
Turn it up a notch, fuck about a block (oh oh oh)
Fuck curly head, fold him like a wallet (a skrrt), yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Whoa whoa whoa
Diamonds hittin' way from here to the Texaco
Grab the egg beater and a lil Coca-Cola
Bet my dawg I want what he want if it's ebola
I just be crunchin' the xans
This a green with Herm√©s
Saint Laurent with the kicks
Green dot, big business
Fallin' out 'bout a bitch
Kid rocks 'bout a bitch
Kid rocks, we takin' real chances
Got that paperwork written up
Some just like foreign sight shit, take it to four notches
Got a white bitch, no boycott, go at some boy notches
I made a forty-five, pussy I sort that
Maybach like a fat cat, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Rap game like the street game
Niggas do anything for rap fame
I'll bet a nigga never take my chain
These niggas be shootin' with no aim
You miss 'em, bring me my chain
YSL, BMG, that's my gang
Count music, yeah that's my lane
I don't get wet when it rain
Yeah they prayed on my downfall
But I flex on all y'all
Got more money then all y'all
Just spent fifty in Lenox Mall
Lost a million and didn't stress
VVS in my diamond necklace
Diamonds hitting like led lights
You niggas got on moissanite
I'm a trap star, real boss nigga
I don't chase hoes, yeah I buy bitches
Bought a Bentley truck, like you rap niggas
Not off rap money, I'm a trap nigga

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We come and take over your ward, like a STD (yeah yeah)
I got lights on me bling in the dark, I got LED (yeah yeah)
Lil shawty photogenic, she collagin' (yeah yeah)
We gon' spin the block with the carbon if you're dodgin' me (yeah yeah yeah)
All us hard body, shiny diamond watches (diamonds hard body)
Chinese kitty cat, yeah, make it hard to not (oh oh oh)
Turn it up a notch, fuck about a block (oh oh oh)
Fuck curly head, fold him like a wallet, yeah

[Verse 3: VL Deck]
Tom Ford trenchcoat, no Colombine (woo)
Exclusive Gang, ST, I spent a trap dime (all trap)
See the shit around my wrist, I'm dyin' 'bout it (VVS)
Forty-one busted up, this is not a Breitling
Trap rap, can't relate then don't recite it
Plus I'm livin' proof of winning, bitch I'm out the projects
And I lead and they listen, I'm a street prophet
Went from stalking bank tellers, now I make deposits

[Chorus: Young Thug]
We come and take over your ward, like a STD (yeah yeah)
I got lights on me bling in the dark, I got LED (yeah yeah)
Lil shawty photogenic, she collagin' (yeah yeah)
We gon' spin the block with the carbon if you're dodgin' me (yeah yeah yeah)

[Outro: Young Scooter & Young Thug]
I'm a trap star, real boss nigga
I don't chase hoes, yeah I buy bitches
Bought a Bentley truck, like you rap niggas
Not off rap money, I'm a trap nigga
Tell me what you want
You want the money or the crumbs?
You want the beans or the crumbs?
You want (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Do you want a milly or the crumbs? (yeah)
Do you want the bread or the brumbs? (yeah)
Do you want to be wealthy or bum? (yeah yeah yeah, yeah), oh
