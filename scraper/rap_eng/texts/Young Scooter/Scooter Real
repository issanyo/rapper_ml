[Verse 1: Ralo]
I told Scooter I wanted to rap about a year ago
Now here I go, five thousand dollars for a show
I used to sleep on the floor, I used to sleep on the couch, in Scooter’s house
I went and bought me an ounce, I had to bounce
Look at me now
I fell in love with that dog food, I fell in love with that money
None of my niggas ain’t wanting for nothing
Scooter I got you, believe me, I promise
Scooter done put me in the game
Scooter done put me in the game, yeah
Tell ‘em my life anything
Young nigga tryna make change, yeah
I get that mic and I rock the show
Tell all them haters they got to go
Tell all them haters they got to know
I got this shit out a pot and bowl
It ain’t a pistol don’t bang so
I went hard for that bankroll
It ain’t a place that I can’t go
Went down the road but ain’t told

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I did this all for me ‘cause nobody real as me
I’m street smart nigga, I’m a young OG
I fuck with real niggas like the runts in OGD
Salute my young niggas, keep it real until I street
These niggas ain’t real no more, everybody crossing everybody
Drive extra in the Maybach floor ‘cause I don’t give a damn about it
I damn near lost my mind, I was broke down, passing in the county
Now it’s 20 thou’ a show and I’m off in your county
These rappers say they in the streets, I never heard of ‘em
Cross Scooter, 187, murder
Jugghouse, if I don’t know you I don’t serve ya
House full of juggs, Atwon watch the camera

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Who keep it realer than Scooter do?

[Outro: Ralo]
All this jewelry we got on
This shit come from [?]
Ain’t no flaws in this shit
You can call Lil Elliot
70 thousand dollar watches nigga
Look at this shit here
Scooter ain’t take me to the middle of the mall nigga
He took me to the top jeweler in the motherfucking country nigga
Elliot, guess what I did nigga
I spent 500 thousand on that shit nigga
In a half a year nigga
Ralo
Fam, goon!
