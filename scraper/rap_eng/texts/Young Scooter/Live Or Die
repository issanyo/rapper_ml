[Hook: Young Scooter]
I just talked to mama today
Son, do you rather live or die?
Scooter got kids to feed
So you know I’m on the front line
Fake rumors in the streets, let them tell it
I been dead fifty times
Look at all the dirt a nigga did in the streets
Thank god I’m still alive

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Boosie said you an OG at 25
I’m from the streets so you know we jugg to survive
Ten times I almost died, thank god I’m still alive
So be cool at my show, my niggas shooting  crowds
I wish I could live forever, I wish I could live forever
Rap game made my whole life better
I’m street smart, I deserve a medal
I wish I could live forever, I wish I could live forever
I don’t want to die
I wish I could live forever, I wish I could live forever
Can’t let my kids down
Me and Thug both made it, made our mamas proud
Music made it overseas
Even through the ups and downs I still stayed down
Sacrifice loyalty

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I want them bands and that’s my whole fucking plan to get up out the streets
Hundred bands on the head of a man if I want ‘em, out the streets
Bitches all on me, she got cum all on her jeans
Baby hold on me, I’m just kidding ain’t havin my genes
Hey, share with the team
Hey, lil bitch I know trigonometry
Yeah, pass the bitch off
Yeah I know lots about all these rappers
Yeah these hoes, they gon’ fuck
I-I wanted it all and never get rid of it
Every time I choke on this kush it smell like children and shit
Ya digg?
