[Chorus:]
It’s a dirty game [x2]
Shit done changed
A lot of shit done changed
It’s a dirty game [x2]
Shit done changed
A lot of shit done changed
It’s a dirty game and I know you know it
It’s a dirty world and the police show it
It’s a dirty game [x2]
Shit done changed
A lot of shit done changed

[Verse 1:]
The street done changed, the street done changed
The f*cking police they know everything
I mastermind at rock like Jay and Dave
I don’t bang, I look bargain same
Out on these streets, in these hills I’m good
It’s a lot of fake banging going right now
Nigga that ain’t good
It’s a lot of fake police killing everyday
Niga that ain’t good
These rappers fake beef everyday
These niggas really ain’t from the hood
Ten times out of ten
Nigga I’m going in (turn up, turn up)
You niggas keep hating
I really get it in
My money so dirty, gotta wash it off
We twenty four hours, nigga no days off

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You’s meeting the lawyer
He played the news
But free Big Meeks cause he a real nigga
These judges dirty, it’s a f*cked up system
Don’t want you eat meals, they want you in prison
So I play it smart, everyday grind hard
Just for my kids so they don’t gotta starve
It’s a dirty game, you don’t want street fame
Your name get hot, that’s when the doorbell ring
It’s a letter from the Feds, you done been indicted
These niggas so fake so they keep it silent
Nigga get f*cked up, the whole clique get locked up
That shit too dirty, how they deal with Bobby Shmurda

[Chorus]
