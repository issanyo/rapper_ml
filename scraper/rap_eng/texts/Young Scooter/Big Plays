[Hook: Young Scooter]
We got what you need, you can order that
2015 whip, we preorder that
Meet the plug in the bottom, that’s where Florida at
A house full of bricks and players, place your order play
We make big plays, we make big plays
We make big plays, we make big plays
Taylor J, Young Scooter, we make big plays
What you need, place your order and give me a day

[Verse 1: Taylor J]
So many days, so many nights, so many loses
But twice as many comebacks, I was down to nothing
In every hood, it’s something bout the way I hustle
Every time, it never fails, I make me some
Cause how much frustrations weighs it makes me want to take me something
I was plotting on a bunch of niggas, just wasn’t saying nothing
Why the fuck they telling me to have it, ain’t they hating on me
Just in case they get the wrong idea, ain’t no safety button
Flexing tracks and checking tracking numbers, Taylor waiting on us
Scooter said “finesse em” think we paying and keep waiting on us
Seen the biggest play I ever seen and that shit changed me homie
Rubber band my dreams until the only thing I seen was money

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Got to make a big play, got to make a big play, got to make a big play
What you need? A trap load ain’t shit, nigga I juug that every day
You ain’t seen no weight, you ain’t seen no weight, you ain’t seen no weight
My dope man got on Louis’ nigga that’s how we play
They coming in Monday, Hector on the way
Paper trail shit, they come in every day
I’m in Atlanta but I’m juuging from two states away
Reek hit me with Taylor J, he say he got a big play
You know Scooter a real paper chase
Fuck nigga, you a fucking hater
Black Migo, we make big plays
How to finesse a nigga, I know 100 ways
