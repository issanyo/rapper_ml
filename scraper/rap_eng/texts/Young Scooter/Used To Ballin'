[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin', yeah

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Every day I ball, gotta get this guap
I'm always flexin', catch me ballin' on the opps
You leavin' one of ones, you are not a problem
I even dropped out the pussy 'cause the money callin'
My niggas shoot like Kyrie
Cocaine in my IV
Juggin' is a hobby
Bitch I'm the street lottery
Yeah I wanna smash but them bricks just came in
Every time I re-up cop a quarter million
Yeah my bitch asian but her hair Brazilian
I count a whole ticket when a nigga boring

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin', yeah

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I can hear that money callin' a thousand miles away
I blew like ninety thousand gambling yesterday
I spend that shit and jugg that check up, nigga right back today
From the project hallways, I came a long way
Now I'm ballin' like LeBron
I re-up on the phone
You need a plug, I could put you on
But ain't no talkin' on the phone
Yeah I wanna smash but them pounds just came in
Let the top back, her hair blowin' in the wind
Scooter why you always flexin', bitch I came from nothin'
Black Amigo Scooter lit just like a stadium

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
Girl I want to smash but that money callin'
Baby it's the truth that I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin'
I got used to ballin', yeah
