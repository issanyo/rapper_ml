[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Sun shining, top down
Everyday beautiful, I jugg eight hundred pounds
I used to struggle now it's free bandz good times
My son six years old, counting a hundred thousand
Plus I'm about to have a girl, now my life complete
Plus I don't got no girl, married to the streets
And this a money world, all my money free
It's a beautiful day when you can buy a key
I always ride around with bands on the seat
Your name hold weight when you can flood the streets
It's beautiful to sell six trucks a week
BMG I own my own company

[Hook:]
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, sun shine hit the wet paint
We smoke kush and sip drank, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2: Travis Porter]
I'm talking about bad bitches, gold rollies
I'm talking about getting digits, them hoes know me
Niggas in the hood still moving marijuana
Their biggest dream is getting rich and move to California
Like Uncle Phil, big truck with them monster wheels, hopping out with them ninos
I'm walking around all this gold on, that shit weigh a whole kilo
That East Side, that Glenwood, that Candler Road, that Flat Shoals
Riding round my top down, my year here, that's black bowl
Everything pretty, pouring up dirty
Presidential Rolly, cost about a birdie
Trying to see a hundred M' by time I hit thirty
Paint so wet, I pull up on out the girlies
Four Gs on the rims, sunroof open
Black can't see 'em, Ferragamo with the Tims
I drank a lot of codeine and smoked a lot of dope
You know I fuck with Scooter, got them packs that filt with coke

It's a beautiful day, I'm with this bitch from the Bay
She given pussy with no problem, I fuck every day
You're living up your ass, that's what it was on the sail
Been working hard for a long time, right now it's time to play
The sun shining so bright, diamonds shining so bright
That top down in the winter time, just thank God for the life
My bills paid, nigga, I'm paid
My crib laid, my bitch faded
Decatur raised me, I'm a nineties baby
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Rick back home, make me feel so good
Bro just did a seven, man, it’s all good
I gotta say fuck the feds, do that for the hood
We’re millionaires now, we on billboards
Everything I couldn’t buy, now I can afford it
Spin the powder around like the wheel of fortune
Outta that crack pot I done made a fortune
My partner PrimeTime told me stay focused
My OG homie Pop told me keep it going
I mastermind the block, I need a Grammy for it
??? Garden in New Jersey, remember that summer, homie
Salute my real niggas, that's like a home for me
