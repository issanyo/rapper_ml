[Hook]
Play with them kilos
Play with them keys like Alicia
Play with them keys, like I'm Stevie
Play with em, play with em, play with em
Play with them keys
Them hot spots my spots
The inside the whip is banana pudding
I smashed the bitch like Penelope
Know what to do with the recipe

[Verse 1: Future & Young Scooter]
A thousand of bags my repertoire
Land on the pad in the helicopter
It’s Mafia, Freebandz everything
(What else?) White or the pills, boy we got everything
Cocaine, cocaine
We got keys of cocaine
Whole thing

[Hook 2]
Play with them keys like Alicia
Play with them keys, like Cristina
Play with em, play with em, play with em
Play with them keys
Them hot spots my spots
The inside the whip is banana pudding
I smashed the bitch like Penelope
Know what to do with the recipe
Play with them keys like Alicia
Play with them keys, like Cristina
Play with em, play with em, play with em
Play with them keys, play with them kilos

[Verse 2 – Young Scooter]
All my migos, I play with kilos
The pesos, dinero, that’s how my day goes
Cruising down Melrose, press down on keys like Stevie
You know them bricks the key to every city
I’m on a juggathon, paper chasing these millis
Get rich or die trying like that nigga 50
Black migo, cocaine cowboy
Get a twenty to the [?] for 20 keys

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Cocaine, dope game, rap game
You know Scooter I’m in both lanes
Cut your plug off
I got em cheaper on that whole thing
Press down on them keys like Alicia
Make the pot sing
I keep a dope boy Rolex on, fuck a Brietling
He say he want that lightskin, half white too
I know you flexing money, through with you
Sold 100 keys in a day or two
I call shots like the mayor do
Run it baseline like Blake Griffin
You selling keys, then no snipping

[Hook 2]
