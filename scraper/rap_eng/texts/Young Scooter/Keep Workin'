[Intro: Young Scooter]
Ain't no motherfuckin' recession, nigga
Just don't stop workin'

[Hook x2]
Keep workin', keep workin', keep workin', keep workin'
Gucci workin', Scooter workin', you a street nigga, keep workin'

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Keep workin', we keep workin'
I got mid, loud kush, good purpin'
Keep servin', keep twerkin' and you will never find yo' son so stop searchin'
I tote this .45 everyday for one purpose: So I ain't gon' let a nigga hurt me
Hit a lick wit' ya cousin, he worthless
Swear I never seen a nigga so nervous
That pack came real early on a Thursday
$300,000 counted and it ain't even 4:30
I'm super swag jack so they don't really search me
You got yo' gun in the car; mines on person

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
No days off Young Scooter gotta work
Wit' this remix dope I got the trap goin' berserk
If I fuck around and take my shirt off baby you might see some work
I got bricks on top of bales and I got bales on top of Ms
Bentley, 'Rari, Old School, and I just bought me a M
Got two plugs in every country so I take off half of them
I got juug on top of juugs and I got bands on top of that
Behind 10 I'm ridin' rentals I got packs on top of straps
I got anything you want you know I keep a lot of crack
Every dope boy product in the country count yo' sack
Pull up anywhere wit' them bricks, Don't give a fuck 'bout where you at
Juug house on every corner, I know how to work a trap

[Hook]
