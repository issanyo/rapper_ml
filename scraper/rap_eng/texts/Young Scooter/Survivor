[Verse 1: Ralo]
I made it out of the struggle
Shout out on my mother
Mama said I can't have friends
All of these niggas my brothers
I survived over everything
Niggas dying over everything
Niggas talking when the feds came
Moving along is a bad thing
Everybody get tried
Only the strong survive

[Hook: Ralo]
A life like this, you won't survive
The crosses, the losses, the hustle, the judge, I survive

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I'mma survive, I'mma survive, I'mma survive yeah
Tell 'em I'm trying, tell 'em I'm tired, tell 'em I tried yeah
I'm gonna shine, 'til I get mine, I'm on my grind yeah
I have a life I will admire even if dying
I tell my best friend I hate him
Tell him I'm never gon' ask for a favour
I wasn't stable, even disabled
That can't erase him, fuck your eraser
They can never erase what was written
I done went places they never been
Tell 'em I'm never gon' sell again
They gon' wish they never lied to me
I'm back on my grind, back on my grind
When I was wasting my time
I'mma get mine, I'm doing fine
Don't think they had my behind
I put my life on the line
I put my bitch in a loaf
All of these bitches be pissing me off
I'mma go hard just like I was soap

[Hook: Ralo]
A life like this, you won't survive
The crosses, the losses, the hustle, the judge, I survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
All the hating, the snitching, the days I ain't listen but I survive

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I ain't listening to mama, fuck with the bats in the jungle
I get the pay by the bundle
None of my bitches done want them
I do whatever I wanna
They let me out of that ring store
Now I sit back and I brainstorm
Niggas was acting like they know
Keychain talking to hang on
I got up out of that cage
Tell 'em stay out of my way
Tell 'em stay out of my face
Tell 'em I'm not gonna play
Won't put up with these niggas
I won't fuck with these bitches
I fell in love with that kitchen
It get all my attention
All my pistols extended
Tell the robbers come get it
Tell them haters I did it
Ralo, fuck up the city

[Hook: Ralo]
A life like this, you won't survive
The hustle, the cases, the judge, but I survived
A life like this, you won't survive
The crosses, the losses, the hustle, the judge, I survive
Survive, survive, survive, survive
All the hating, the snitching, the days I ain't listen but I survive
