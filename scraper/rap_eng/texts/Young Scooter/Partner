Gotta keep it real with your partner

[Verse 1]
My partner ran off on me (he gone)
I had to let him live (fuck him)
I love his kids
But I ain't gonna blame them for what he did (naw)
I want the bills
But I ain't trying to sign the wrong deal (naw)
Before this rap
Me and my partners spent a couple mill'
Always keep it real nigga
Thats what you must do
And always watch the niggas standing close to you
And test drive every brick a nigga put in front you (what you mean?)
When she give you some bull shit
And now moneys through with you
You never sell dope again
You can't re-up
Nobodys gonna give you shit
'Cause you went broke
And they done switched up
Got set up by a bitch
You must be a lick nigga you over
I rap and sell bricks
And keep it real with my partners

[Hook]
On the road with my partners
On the block with my partners
Splitting bands with my partners
Rock the choppa for my partners
Thats my brother from another (yessir)
Put no one before him
All about a dollar
Me and my partner go harder

[Verse 2]
Me and my dog go harder
Show them how to turn the water
Taking sips up out the shower
Then we go meet our importer
Never play both sides
Nigga I am not a quarter
I got (?)
Plus I gotta feed my daughter
Never been a sit around
Nigga Young Ju man a starter
Me and my partner riding foreign
On the coasts always sporting
Got his bitch 'cause he boring
Flying G4 not Boeing
East Atlanta raised
But I'm with Georgia back to born
(?) nigga
That is in my blood
Used to say cus'
Switch it up and now it thug
One time for the real niggas
Its a lot of love
Young Juicy, Young Scooter
Thats my partner (?)

[Hook x2]
