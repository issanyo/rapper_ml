[Intro:]
You know how to do this shit nigga
Real street shit (turn up)
(Let’s go)

[Chorus:]
I ain’t tryna go back to jail but for my niggas
I will, I’ll kill
Don’t you fuck with my nigga
I made 1.5 off of shows last year
But this year you know imma spend a mil on my nigga
This rap shit fake as hell
Got K Black and VL
You know I rather invest in my nigga
Don’t leave the house without your pistol
Cause these streets done got twisted
Now fucking shout out Top Shotta my nigga

[Verse 1:] [Top Shotta]
[?]’ll choke you to death over my homie
Scarface just a movie cause I’m smart as Tony
Invaded by the rooks that call around while I was sleep
Fuck with ma niggas emptying’ toppers every week
So you and that motherfucker
And just don’t give a fuck
Ain’t going back to see my kids on the bottom of that top bunk
My flows, my rhymes, nobody cannot fuck wid em
I love my niggas but nothing closer than these
Damn that pussy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Feet to the ground
I get your [?]
Betta pay me
For ma pawtna nigga
K rick comin’a slay shit
Apply pressure
Man screw the a blast
Catch me with his brother
On the couch
Blowing in hash
I can’t leave the street
Passport I need ma family
Weasel past left
[?] stuck loose grip [?]
All my guns are from texas
Try housing like the cars
Made them ranks on me
Put me in the brink of that [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [K Blacka]
Kluk what now friends do (Young Scooter)
But to your club I’m speaking French tho
You know that Blacka don’t need no lingo
A thousand bricks if I say so
I don’t trust everybody but I know ma niggas got me
But could you not
Don’t play with me nigga
I ain’t goin back to that cell
I got ma same [?]
Pray to God they free all the real niggas

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
I’m vicious living like VL
I got Young Scooter move them bills
Got D Heav to check the mail
That’s ma nigga
On these streets we got them drops
I yell out Pookie you get shot
And that’s another body dropped by my nigga
I ain’t thinkin bout no jail
Cause with [?] you catch some shells
I know K Blacka will leave you out for ma nigga
Man these rappers fake as hell
I hear one mill he leave the deal
From the slide I never change on my nigga
(Stay 100)

[Chorus]
