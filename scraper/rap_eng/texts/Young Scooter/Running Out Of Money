(Intro)
Chea, (haha) now I ain't running out of money no more
Found a hustle nigga (ha)
Fuck the police (heh)
Road runner

(Chorus)
If a nigga get caught ain't nothing
I be hustling, I got money
These rap niggas broke fake hustling
These rappers running, Out of money
Real dope boy nigga i ain't fronting
I turn nothing, into something
I can see you haters' faces I be stunting
But I'm jugging never running out of money

(verse 1)
I see you hating but I love it
I'm just a hustler and you ain't nothing
You had a bud but it's gone, you had some money but it's gone
You riding foreign but it's a renter
Black Migo my niggas winning
Jugg house its my summer
Fuck a label i only sign with stunter

(Chorus)
If a nigga get caught ain't nothing
I be hustling, I got money
These rap niggas broke fake hustling
These rappers running, Out of money
Real dope boy nigga i ain't fronting
I turn nothing into something
I can see you haters' faces I be stunting
But I'm jugging never running out of money

(verse 2)
I get money, selling dope
Brick man long way from a four
M&m's we call em millions
I done stack my money way past the ceiling
I'm on the grind, I'm gone shine
I know you rob but you ain't never took mine
I got a bank but it don't fold
One hundred thousand in my hand whipping dope

(Chorus)
If a nigga get caught ain't nothing
I be hustling, I got money
These rap niggas broke fake hustling
These rappers running, Out of money
Real dope boy nigga i ain't fronting
I turn nothing into something
I can see you haters' faces I be stunting
But I'm jugging never running out of money

(Verse 3)
I got a deal, that's what they say
But I got deals, on the yay
Cocaina, remix
Nobody trust scooter he took slick
Ben Franklins, fuck a bitch
Fresh outta jail looking like a lick
My BMG chain cost 2 bricks
And I got sixty thousand wrapped around my wrist

(Chorus)
If a nigga get caught ain't nothing
I be hustling, I got money
These rap niggas broke fake hustling
These rappers running, Out of money
Real dope boy nigga i ain't fronting
I turn nothing into something
I can see you haters' faces I be stunting
But I'm jugging never running out of money
