[Intro: Young Scooter]
We got some real Mexicans in this motherfucker
You niggas from Flexican
Jugg King nigga

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Diamonds on me real
Niggas talk that shit, they know we drill
They know niggas 'round me kill
They know niggas 'round me steal
They know niggas 'round me rich
They know niggas 'round me traffic
They know niggas 'round me 'bout that action, boy what's happenin'
I'm a Clayton County nigga 'til the day that I die
We keep Dracos, we keep thirties, young nigga watch your back
All my shooters know they bool 'cause they big dog got a sack
We don't argue over bitches, we just fuck and kick 'em out

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Ain't no rapper sold more pounds than me in Zone 6 ever
Free my nigga Tiny, he used to keep the dopes out like a feather
I'm a real road runner, drive the pack in any weather
Yeah I want that thirty from you, buy a ten the price get better

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I jugg a hundred racks a day nigga, real talk
I ain't talkin' 'bout rap money, I'm talkin' 'bout off the fork

Plug pull up with them bricks and I ain't ask for it

My dope come in three colors, brown, white, or tan
Free my lil brother, his case cost me hella bands
My praying hands chain, I bought that shit off Instagram

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Ain't no rapper sold more pounds than me in Zone 6 ever
Free my nigga Tiny, he used to keep the dopes out like a feather
I'm a real road runner, drive the pack in any weather
Yeah I want that thirty from you, buy a ten the price get better

[Outro: Young Scooter]
