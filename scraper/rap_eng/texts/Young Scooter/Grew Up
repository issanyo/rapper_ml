[Intro: Young Dolph]
Yeah, yeah
Aye Dolph
I’m on the Paper Route too nigga
I’m on the Paper Route too nigga
(I’m on the Paper Route too nigga)

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips

[Verse 1 : Young Dolph]
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
Same color diamonds in my motherfucking ears
The pastor in the church selling my grandmamma hope
Dolph in the hood, counting money, selling dope
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up, got addicted to money and found the plug
Police run in here, it’s too much dope to flush
Remember I count 200 bands and said this ain’t enough
Super sport with wet paint, big feet
I pull up and kill shit, 6 feet
One street, 3 spots, a 100 pounds
8 scales, 10 straps, a 1000 rounds

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips

[Verse 2 : Young Scooter]
My partner gang bang but I ain’t joined the gang
Scooter run the fucking Black Amigo money gang
50 thousand dollar ring, watch plain Jane
My nigga Low key Cali creeping and he ain't bust a brain
I do a lot of Cali business, they got cheap things
Flush this shit, I know I’m never going broke again
Memphis Tenn', Paper Route
Flying packs landing at the juug house
I grew up a hustler trappin' at my mama house
When she go to work I turn it to a crack house
72 Chevelle same color the Crips
Dope with no smell, it go for 26

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips

[Verse 3 : Project Pat]
Patter flip off, money like a wendy’s burglar
Start big, I’m for a young nigga on a curber
Run to, "casa" hustle crack off the worker
Play with my dough, chop a bullet, might just murk ya
He said if I turned, mo bitch only twenty
Sellin' pills and weed, I was getting money
Just another nigga made a million off a words
Police arrest me like I made a million off a birds
I flip the strip and made a lick, I’m the shit like a turd
That choppa blow yo' ass away, yo' shoe left on the curb
A nigga gotta make a way ‘cause I ain’t trynna loose
I ain’t giving up, oh shit you can call me Scrooge

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
My childhood friend grew up and became a Blood
But I grew up and made a living off a drugs
Seventy G's invested in my own whip
72 Chevelle same color as the Crips
