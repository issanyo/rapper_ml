Zaytoven
Yeah, haha

Young Scooter

[Chorus: Plies & Young Scooter]
Yeeaaaah
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner?
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing?
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it? (Snitch)
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner? (You ain't no boss)
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing? (Flex)
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it?

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
You say you the brick man, but you can't make bond (What)
You say you ride 'Raris, but never drove a foreign
I'm a real brick man, and all my plugs, they foreign (They foreign)
I get bricks on say so, some days when I get bored
Some bitch just hit my phone, these hoes talkin' 'bout, "she's broke"
I play it how it go, bitch better come sell some dope (Work)
Take me to your boss man, nigga this ain't no joke
In my hood we got black Mexicans, Kirkwood, Lil Mexico (Young Scooter)

[Chorus: Plies]
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner?
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing?
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it?
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner?
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing?
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it?
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner?
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing?
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it?
You mean to tell me you fuckin' all these niggas, y'ain't got no money?
You mean to tell me, nigga, y'ain't a boss, you'se just a runner?
You mean to tell me y'ain't really got it, you just flexing?
You mean to tell me they got you downtown and made you tell it?
