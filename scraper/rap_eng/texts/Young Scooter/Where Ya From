[Hook]
I got homies, they just waiting for a bond
I got ice and I got Christian Louboutins
They gonna clone a nigga swagging and they gonna run
We get money fuck it up just for fun
We been working with that A1 since day one
I stay hustling like I ain't already won
Moving trucks, loads of midget by the ton
I know niggas just like me where ya from

[Future]
I ...get to the money, had to buy a bag with a bunch of money
I just ate and I’m still hungry
I've been throwin' and I'm still throwin'
These niggas fake, they really foreign
I stay draping and I stay touring
A1, F1B, my plug here, my bitch foreign
Gotta feel my niggas like ever time
They talk then on the phone line
We made a mill in no time
They still hating, we still shine
You fascinated by my life
I turnt up, you sound bite
My adlibs be too high, got white gold, got new ice
Got faragamo got new chanel, won’t hesitate to send them through the mail
I thank God I'm still here
I’m a trail blazer, you can’t compare
My hard times and my hard work
I sip syrup, wear designer shirt
I’m a trendsetter, I did it first
I been fly since my birth
It’s my gift, my curse

[Hook]
I got homies, they just waiting for a bond
I got ice and I got Christian Louie Vuittons
They gonna clone a nigga swagg and they gonna run
We get money fuck it up just for fun
We been working with the A1 from Day 1
I stay hustling like I ain't already won
Moving trucks, loads of midget by the ton
I know niggas just like me where ya from

[Trouble (ATL)]
The streets in trouble I just make bond
Flight risk, I’m always on the run
We got choppas we got hand guns
A million cash that ain’t nothin to us
Freeband gang we got all the dough
The life I live is international
Leaning on that field got me moving slow
Made so many jewels gave them to my folks
Without the fork I can still cook the dough
White Porsche I cooked out what I up the stove
The code of the streets is to never fold
Your partner missing nigga cause he snitched and told
