[Hook: Young Scooter]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend, be about your business
Stand ten toes down and get it
And work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
When you call a nigga phone and they don't answer for you
That mean that nigga never gave a fuck about you
You in the streets, don't keep your ID in your wallet
I got like six names, I can be anybody
Early in the mornin' got the stove rockin'
Everything I do I see somebody watchin'
Lost everything I had and Future said he got me
I turn them free bands to millions of dollars
Made some juugs with Dolph now I'm good in Ohio
Do you like my slick partner blow them packs by you?
Hit up dope phone, ain't workin' in the gump
So anything you want, I got it in the trunk

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend, be about your business
Stand ten toes down and get it
And work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
They say crime don't pay, well, if crime don't pay
Then I'm lying, I'm flying and the sun ain't shine
Say it all the time, It'll come in due time
I ain't got no time, Imma rob for mine
Don't ask how, I'm a cash cow
Can't wait then because I need it now
Say I'm insane cause my pistol hang
I'm at the shooting range like I'm Jesse James
Got great aim, yeah, I'm accurate
I'm a pimp nigga, I can mack a bitch
And I can't turn water to wine, bitch
But I can turn half a brick to a whole brick
That 2Pac, that old shit
Fill a nigga ass with holes quick
Use a nigga head for a trophy
Then dump a nigga body in the ocean
Finger a bitch with my trigger finger
Same finger that I roll a blunt with
How the fuck you a Hitman
And I paid you and you ain't hit shit?
Not Byrd Gang but it's Bricksquad
But I make a nigga whole set dip quick
Got a new Mac with a cooler on it
Hope you folks got insurance on it

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend, be about your business
Stand ten toes down and get it
And work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
You in the streets and you ain't got it
Nigga, you better take it
Every nigga 'round me is impatient
Down in Miami, I know a couple of Haitians
Man, guardin' projects the bricks stupid crazy
Before the day over, twenty to a eighty
Remix like a cater, I serve you like a waiter
You on the block with no pack, nigga, I see you later
Got dope all flavors, catch me working daily
All I want is paper, BMG we made it
We gotta go to work, you can't be looking crazy
Your trap will go berzerk, if you know how to play it
I had to switch my house, these niggas snitching crazy

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Only thing I know is get them packs in
Don't ever let a nigga think you need him
Fuck a friend, be about your business
Stand ten toes down and get it
And work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
