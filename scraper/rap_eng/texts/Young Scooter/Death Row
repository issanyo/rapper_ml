[Intro]
Yeah
You know what
It's a must I do this shit for my niggas in prison
Know my lil brother fightin' for his life, you dig?

[Chorus]
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row

[Verse 1]
OG Snoop beat the case, facing death row
Life have you goin' in circles like a merry-go
If anybody disrespect me, let them rounds go
They just gave Chuck a dub for playin' with the blow
Death row, you know that's the same thing as life
Late night, you can't walk around without the pipe
If I got caught with what TIP got caught with, I'd probably doin' life
If you was on death row, how would you spend your last night?
When you commit a crime don't let nobody know
[?] doin' two lifes, he be talking slow
You go to trial, they bring your partner out the back door
Now he a codefendant, that's how this shit really go (yeah)

[Chorus]
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row

[Verse 2]
I stopped Black from goin' to trial, facing death row
I remember he shot himself, I called him Plaxico
See that interrogation room, they take you out your zone
They say you on that murder scene, you done did something wrong (snitch)
I hope you ain't got no kids, 'cause you ain't coming home
Nigga you ain't seein' nothin' but you ain't played a role
First they got 'em on the phone, tryna talk in code
My face platinum in the streets, far past gold (Young Scooter)
See the judge gave you life, that's really death row
'Cause the moral of the story, you never comin' home
Yeah, I could be doin' life but I ain't gon' rap about it
I know a couple real niggas that never talked about it

[Chorus]
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row
2Pac, I know niggas on death row
Suge Knight, I know niggas on death row
You got more than sixty years, nigga that's death row
If the judge gives you life, that's really death row
