[Intro]
Ay, man, this is Swamp Izzo, world premiere

[Chorus]
Relationship, friendship, tell you the truth, all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business, add 'em both together, equals super rich (Hoodrich, nigga)
Relationship, friendship, tell you the truth, all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business, add 'em both together, equals super rich (Yo, Swamp Izzo, I'm reloaded)

[Verse]
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty equals Freebandz royalties
Young Scooter, I'm ballin' see, a boss man, I own my own royalties
Relationship, friendship, no thats not how my niggas kick it
We family, business, play it how it go, real street shit
Relationship, I ain't with it, I don't need a girl thats on that bullshit
What you talkin' 'bout? Thats irrelevant
I ain't never met you, must be snitchin'

[Chorus]
Relationship, friendship, tell you the truth, all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business, add 'em both together, equals super rich
Relationship, friendship, tell you the truth, all that shit irrelevant
Loyalty, business, add 'em both together, equals super rich
