[Intro: Young Scooter]
My nigga for real
Pep-Do and Ty-Rack now nigga
And I was with ‘em on that charge

[Hook: Young Scooter]
He say he your nigga for real
But will he take a charge?
My grandma hate the life that I live
Every time I catch a charge I break her heart
Josh was with me on my trafficking case
I went ahead and took the charge
And you won’t feel the shit I said
If you ain’t never been charged

[Verse 1: Ralo]
Black Amigo, Black Amigo, bitch you know we mobbin’
I know these niggas robbing but we never pillow talking
I sit in back of the foreign, I got my hand on that garbage, I get retarded
Me and my niggas ain’t arguing, they gon’ be sorry, all of my dogs be barking
None of these niggas ain’t making noise
All of my bitches gon’ take the charge
All of these niggas know we in charge
Scooter lieutenant and I’m the sarge
They used to talk ‘bout my voice, now that lil nigga the boy, bitch I’m a star
I just bought my bitch a car, she don’t never need a job, she unemployed
All of my niggas gon’ kill for me
All of my bitches gon’ steal for me
All my ex-hoes still love me
They gon’ be here if it’s real ugly
Bitch I’m the man, fuck what you saying, I got them bands
My niggas straight when they goin’ out, they know Lil Ralo got bond fare

[Hook: Young Scooter]
He say he your nigga for real
But will he take a charge?
My grandma hate the life that I live
Every time I catch a charge I break her heart
Josh was with me on my trafficking case
I went ahead and took the charge
And you won’t feel the shit I said
If you ain’t never been charged

[Verse 2: VL Deck]
Tell it to my nine, better yet my uzi
Bond money on deck, plus my lawyer Jewish
What y’all niggas know ‘bout being real, y’all foolish
And ask my nigga Scooter did I take the charge for the tooly
Oh this your main man? Will he take the stand?
Or he won’t, what you got soon as you hit the can?
Every nigga say they love me scare me, know why?
Cause I done seen the best of the killers go testify
Shout out to Jon Gotti, shout out to Frank Wright
Silent niggas who didn’t turn states for the white
Loyal advocate for Benjamin’s and my friends
If I get caught, I hang my pictures up, I do my ten

[Hook: Young Scooter]
He say he your nigga for real
But will he take a charge?
My grandma hate the life that I live
Every time I catch a charge I break her heart
Josh was with me on my trafficking case
I went ahead and took the charge
And you won’t feel the shit I said
If you ain’t never been charged
