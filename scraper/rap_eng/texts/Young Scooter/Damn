Yeah
Fuckin' all this money up
Damn

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Just lost my whole life savings in a dice game yesterday (Damn)
Just got outta jail and the first thing they said, "We got rent to pay" (Damn)
My nigga fucked up, got a bond and we can't even make the bail (Damn)
Everything was going good 'til the judge sent the subpoena in the mail (Damn)
My money ain't right, ain't where it's supposed to be
Took a loss last week damn near lost a whole 3
It gotta get better, it can't get worse
They say a broke man is a burden, I ain't tryna be a burden

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I need a get-rich-quick scheme someone I can trick, could be ya best man at your wedding, to me just a fuckin' lick
You better bring ya pistol wit'cha when you shoppin' in the six
You better check them bricks before you leave yo' ass won't have a split
Yo' baby-mama suck a mean dick, I swear the bitch a tick
And I was on my dick the day I met the bitch right in the Ritz
I remember I didn't even have a car in '96
4 niggas buyin' a 4, man we goin' in on a split
When ya drop the money, check the dope and watch out for the switch
And I'm ballin' like an athlete cause Gucci like to pitch
I got mob ties you mooliani, you a fuckin' prick
Kiss ya cheek and say, "Capisce?" then I mail ya mom ya dick
(Wop)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Everythang was all good just a week ago, 7 days later a nigga flat broke
Walk a juug in the house and do the julio, hit 'em wit' the dummy-bank and let him out the do'
Every artist Gucci got known fo' kickin' doo's, every time I switch up pots I hit up Mojo
Bring a pyrex and a four to yo' front do', everything I ever bought I whipped it out the bowl
I gotta sell these bricks so I can hurry up and make some mo'
And I could go broke today I'mma real street nigga; I never fold

[Hook]

[Outro: Gucci Mane]
I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke (Naw)
I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke, I can't go broke, nigga
