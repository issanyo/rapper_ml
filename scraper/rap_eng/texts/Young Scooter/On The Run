[Hook: Gucci Mane] x2
If a nigga got a 44, hangin' out the window
Lettin' the fucker go, I suggest you motherfucking run, run
See my plug send a kilos, gangster kush and indo
Bounty Hunters kickin' doors, 'cause they know I'm on the run, on the run

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Went on for the plug, he will showing  all the bricks
Front door back door I'm jumping over the fence
With 50 thousand grams nigga that's 50 free brick
Black amigo scooter known for taking niggas shit
Them young nigga hits your corner in that black van
Swanging dough Waka Flocka and let them guns blow
Bounty Hunter looking for me I don't give a damn
They kick my mama door found the hundred and fifty bands
Ever since they gave me most wanted for the gram
Real dope boy I been Hustle up the grand
Every day I'm flossing my jewelry match my swag
Two different spots don't put the bricks with the swag

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I got black pistols hanging out the black coupe
Jump about that bitch, Gucci everything with the matching boots
Selling dope since high school why I never went to classroom
Don't say nothing to me bitch shut the fuck up unless I ask you
Money on my mind and your bitch swanging on my nuts
On the block hanging Getting in up
In the streets I'm flaming bro, you know what up
Hey look these diamonds clear as water
Dude check out how they sparkle
I gave these niggas the blueprint but I ain't no Sean Carter
Every car I own up under the hood it got a monster
The city flooded with kush and they say that I'm the sponsor
If you see that hung around, hanging out the window
I don't mean no harm but I suggest that you keep go
