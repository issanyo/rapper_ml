[Intro]
Free El Chapo
El Chapo

[Hook: Future]
I'm getting that money like my name El Chapo
The hood they love me like I was El Chapo
I keep the shooters with me like El Chapo
I got a bitch, that bitch call me El Chapo
And they gon' smash you on sight
I know some niggas doing life
And we still playing with the white
I'm ballin' every single night
El Chapo

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Realest nigga in the rap game, nigga, y'all know
Wrapped a whole roll around the brick that's for the car note
Free El Chapo, head to Hector, that's who I know
Put wings on bricks, you don't know the shit that I know
Shots like my name, El Chapo
Don't lose a load, ain't tryna lose no guap, no
Squares hot, we wrap the bricks like tacos
As√≠ se pueden, I know you the po-po
Smashing all sides, I do tricks with the white
You get a Black Amigo price
Your plug ain't like mine
I make dough

[Hook: Future]
I'm gettin' that money like my name El Chapo
The hood they love me like I was El Chapo
I keep the shooters with me like El Chapo
I got a bitch, that bitch call me El Chapo
And they gon' smash you on sight
I know some niggas doing life
And we still playing with the white
I'm ballin' every single night
El Chapo

[Verse 2: Casino]
El Chapo hit my line, he said "you wanna buy the bundle?"
Catch a flight to California, meet me in a tunnel
When I turn that cash, oh they count it by the comma
To you they might be bossin' but to me they just a runner
Man my niggas on the come up, no longer gotta front none
A hater called my phone talkin' brazy, then I hung up
Got the type of killer, pray to God that you run up
Nickname they chopper Future, when they see you they gon' turn up
I'm up tied in Americo, but Casino from Mexico
Grab the snitch nigga, there he go
Underwater nigga, there he float
They find his body off the East Coast, that's how she roll

[Hook: Future]
Ho give me money like my name El Chapo
The hood they love me like I was El Chapo
I keep the shooters with me like El Chapo
I got a bitch, that bitch call me El Chapo
And they gon' smash you on sight
I know some niggas doing life
And we still playing with the white
I'm ballin' every single night
El Chapo
