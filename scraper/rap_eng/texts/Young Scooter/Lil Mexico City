[Hook]
Lil Mexico, that’s the hood I’m from
And everybody there eatin’
Edgewood is the hood I roam
And all my niggas they eatin’
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico is the hood I’m from
And all my niggas they eatin’

[Verse 1]
Bubba back home, and Yo back locked up
Thank god this fucking rap game saved us
Plugs snitching so the dope game fucked up
I found some loopholes in my case, they fucked up
Fresh out of jail, fresh out of jail
They want me locked down, and I could tell
Clientele, clientele
Young Scooter, I can rerock a bale
In every hood and every state in the world
It’s a nigga who snitching
And every time a nigga get shot or robbed
They put my name in an instant
But fuck ‘em

[Hook]
Lil Mexico, that’s the hood I’m from
And everybody there eatin’
Edgewood is the hood I roam
And all my niggas they eatin’
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico, Lil Mexico City
Lil Mexico is the hood I’m from
And all my niggas they eatin’
