[Chorus:]
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(I don’t know what’s wrong)
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(I don’t really know what’s wrong)
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(wrong with these streets)
This shit ain’t like it used to be
(shit ain’t like it used to be)
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(I don’t know what’s wrong)
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(I don’t really know what’s wrong)
I don’t know what’s wrong with these streets
(wrong with these streets)
This shit ain’t like it used to be

[Verse 1:]
I’m street smart
And I know something’s wrong
Niggas tell it man
I know it’s going on
Do your time boy
You know you dead wrong
Yeah I still shine
With no diamonds on
The police yea
They dirty in these streets
Try to [?] some bricks
On your jealousy
The shit I rap about
Attract police
I never change
I’m the same old me
What’s going on man
What’s really going on
Don’t call my phone no
Nigga don’t call my phone
You got caught with five bricks
Don’t tell a soul
They told on 400 niggas
Broke the code

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Streets sour
These niggas coward droppin names
It ain’t the same
The dope game
It done changed
These hoes plotting
The streets watching
I’m all about the
Fucking profit
Half a ticket
Out the hood
Cause I gotta sock it
My young niggas pop molly
Nigga I pop pills
Death to all snitches
And I hope your family miss you
Suppose to be a street nigga
But you soft as tissue
I don’t know what’s wrong
With these niggas
Jumped in the wrong game
In this shit for the fame
‘posed to be out here
Chasing paper
But you chasing bitches
Like a lame
But me
I’m multitasking
Sending thangs
On the plane
Getting pills on the train
You loving it
Benz nigga
Last week ran a train

[Chorus]
