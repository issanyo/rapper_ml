[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
You ain’t gonna find no other nigga like us berg
My life, my life so purped up bad
I got a big bad rollie, no one can follow up
But a chopper should have a nigga don’t holl up
This squad, got racks, got hoes that’s bad
Got hoes with ass, my upper body got bands
I got 20 on it, and I ain’t worry bout shit
Cause I got shooters in zone 1
And I got shooters from zone 6
But I’m from the [?]hoe, know me
As we’re streaming freeze with it
What the fuck you mean, what the fuck you thought
And I got your bitch all in the loft
Headed from the cash on that rollie thang

Lookin like a lick, smellin like a brick
Walking through saz but I smell like a field
And I know I got a gilt from a foot out the rim
Know I’m gonna hot cause I’m lookin like a split
And a brick, and a brick and a brick and a brick
And about 10 more them bricks
Politicians can’t scratch you bitch
Millionaire with a ratchet bitch
Pulled up in a double v6
Go, go, go, go, gadget bitch
Doe jumping out the road, macho man savage bitch
And I never had a stylist
Cause I can’t hang with no fagot bitch

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
Work for jewelry in the hood shooting dice
Lookin like a lick cause I got on this real ice

When you see that red white and blue, they my bricks
I just hit a lick and had to throw away my phone
Throw away pistols, we got throw away homes
Live a very long distance, I could get em to your home
I’ma push it to the limit, hunned million that’s my goal
I know how to handle business in the streets and on the stove Welcome to the mexico nigga where everything goes
Racks on racks on racks on racks, everybody on gold
Traphouse never fold, bricks on white, bricks on gold

[Hook]
Them racks, them racks, them racks, them racks
