(INTRO: Waka Flock Flame)
Damn, I wish they'd take the chains off
I wish they'd open the motherfuckin' gates
Free all my niggas
I wish everybody walk out that grave man
All my loved ones man, SQUAD

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
This one for the homies locked down the road (You Know)
Tryna get them bricks n' bales; thats that ghetto gold (Jug)
I would never rat a nigga out, could never fold (Flocka)
Stay down till you come up
Realest shit somebody ever told me
Molded by the OG’s, the game done show me (You Know)
Tryna to stay away from the police (Woop Woop)
A hustla ain't shit if he can’t save (Unh-uh)
Go to sleep and pray to god I wake up to a play (Yes)

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Shit Hot, streets ain't safe
New got fifteen just the other day (Damn)
Roots snitchin' in the street, what the hood say
My partna be doin' a life sentence, cause he didn't think
I know I'm facing thirty years fuckin with the sink (Whip)
I get so much money I can't even think (Jug)
Twenty years old, bought my first mink
Flashback, Spooks' spot, house full of things
Now my partner Polish, I jug off everything
What I know about the streets? I know everything, I sold everything
I know everybody, I hope you make that appeal, I'm talkin bout everybody

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shit hot, streets' ain't safe
I pray when I kick his door he got a safe (For Real)
Just dead presidents, my pockets stuck in graves (For Real)
Throwing Hail Mary's, Flocka out here catching plays (For Real)
One foot in, One foot out
Fox was home for a week and got took out (Damn)
Lord, why K.O. take his life away
Oh why Rah-Rah had to die, on his bike that day
Why my father have a stand off at the numbers store
I feel like I can't take no more
Dunk missed his flight and died in a studio
Plus my mama just beat cancer (You Know)
I'm looking at the sky for an answer

[Chorus]

(Outro)
