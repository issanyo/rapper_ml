[Stalley]
I came up, I came up
And now I see nothing but hate in their eyes

[Verse 1: Stalley]
All this jewelry on me dripping like a waterfall
Four Gs on the 6 series make the Beamer crawl
Beam on the .45 I make that Eagle bark
Bull dog a nigga eat his face when it spark
I ain't with the talk or that hating shit you on
Niggas pocket watching got the feds on the phone
Money busting seams on the jeans I can't hold it all
Niggas talking beef grab the draco that's that soldier talk
I been hustling since Motorolas getting quarters off
Chevy came with the hard top but that coke was soft
Whole city had a coke wave I was so involved
House bigger than a synagogue, I'm talking Mazeltov

[Hook: Stalley]
I came up, I came up
And now I see nothing but hate in their eyes
They hate I survived
Hate that I tried
They wish that I died
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I ain't gotta cut my grass just to see the snakes
I can see it all on these pussy's face
I can feel the hate
Audemar (?) diamond chains make these niggas hate
Fuck my lawyer, fuck the judge
I fucked my DA and bought the case
Everyday I'm flexing on these haters
I fucked the bitch and left the ho
You can save her
Scooter came up from nothing
Section 8 nigga
Yeah I came up off the rock
Like that nigga Jigga

[Hook: Stalley]
I came up, I came up
And now I see nothing but hate in their eyes
They hate I survived
Hate that I tried
They wish that I died
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes

[Verse 3: Stalley]
Niggas hate to see you up
So they try to pull you down
You know crabs in a barrel
With vultures all around
I built cultures with this sound
Ten toes down
I was planted in the trap
Put midwest on the map
Do the foreign on the Lac
Ack or the yak
Most my niggas sell pack
Trying to stack these dollars
Wear chains like collars
Learn the streets like scholars
Niggas hating for dollars
But still broke with no honors
All honest I been balling no college
Eight digits with commas
Niggas got loose lips
But their money is solid
All my chains yeah they're solid
All this cash get deposit
Goyard, platinum card in my pocket

[Hook: Stalley]
I came up, I came up
And now I see nothing but hate in their eyes
They hate I survived
Hate that I tried
They wish that I died
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
They smile in your face with that hate in their eyes
