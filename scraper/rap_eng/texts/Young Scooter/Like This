[Young Scooter]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
You don't got no plug you can't talk like this
All these free bands make me walk wit' a limp
Gotta have a chicken just to rap 'bout bricks
You searching for a plug then you gon' get hit
You gotta be a boss to live a life like this
Distribute alotta bricks to wear a chain like this
Everyday I'm in the trap I put my life at risk
Stop watching documentaries at the end they snitch
John Gotti the only nigga that kept it real at the end, Meechy too
I salute y'all for keepin' it real
Never snitch, never fold, that's the life I live
In the booth I put a stove I got crack adlibs

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
You gotta have a check, nigga, to talk like this
You gotta have a connect just to walk like this
Bitch look at how these diamonds hittin' on my wrist
I got at least 20 bad bitches on my dick
You gotta have a million just to flex like this
I bet you gotta be rich to wake up with my chick
I swear to god these broke niggas make me sick
You gotta be a vet' to work a fork like this

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I was ballin' 'fore the deal
If you ain't got a million you don't know how I feel
I spent a million in Vegas, I spent a million in LIV, I spent 2 million in cars, I spent 5 million in cribs
You say you eatin' pussy nigga but I'm seein' ya ribs
You say you served me but nigga you was tellin' a fib
I spent 10 million on jewelry, I spent a million on weed
You roll yo' blunts outta 3-5, I roll my blunts outta p
I bought so many bottles I didn't even wanna see the bill
They said, "$150,000," I said, "Is you for real?"
[??????????????????], I pay 10k for the wheels
It's a good day for a party, I buy my pints wit' the seals

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
You gotta have a check, nigga, to talk like this
You gotta have a connect just to walk like this
Bitch look at how these diamonds hittin' on my wrist
I got at least 20 bad bitches on my dick
You gotta have a million just to flex like this
I bet you gotta be rich to wake up with my chick
I swear to god these broke niggas make me sick
And you gotta be a vet' to work a fork like this
