[Intro: Young Scooter]
Black Migo Gang
DohLyfe Weebay in this motherfucker with me

[Chorus: Weebay]
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just want to put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just went and put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a, brick

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
All I ever wanted was a white brick
Black Amigo Scooter, he talk so slick
A fifty to a hundred, I ain't talking days
I did that in an hour, bitch I'm really paid
Mike Jack, make the dope moonwalk
Cook crack, cause a lot of white chalk
I65, I be chasing checks
Do what the fuck I want, I don't need no respect
Cocaina, cocaina, cocaina
Pull out the baking soda, drop it in the aquafina
A lot of dopeboy tricks, I done hit real licks
All my life all I wanted was a thirty-six

[Chorus: Weebay]
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just want to put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just went and put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a, brick

[Verse 2: Weebay]
Indicted my nigga, I had to quit trapping
Charges hurt a nigga soul, ayy
Cook the dope with no bowl, ayy
First rule don't fold, ayy
Whip the four to a nina
Turn my Chevy to a Beamer
Cook the brick in my Gucci
Residue on 'em, left 'em at the cleaners, ayy
Young niggas toting forties, they know I'm a hundred
Big Meech in my city, nigga ask your uncle
Cook the bird, made a mess, that's my baby mama
Paid a junkie to clean the shit 'cause she be with that drama, ayy
Nigga I really be thugging, my homies is killers and robbers
Broke but we shop with that iron, fuck them felony charges, ayy
Stare at the stove, I'm like ooh, stare at the money like ooh
Stepped on a brick in these shoes, serve you a bird, pour a deuce

[Chorus: Weebay]
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just want to put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
All a young nigga wanted was a brick
Turned a nine piece to a thirty-six
I just went and put a hundred on the stick
All a young nigga wanted was a, brick
