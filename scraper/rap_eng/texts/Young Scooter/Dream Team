[Verse 1: Ralo]
I came from the pots and whipping baking soda
I made it over them spots niggas don’t make it over
Why when you make it out the hood they say you can’t come back
I’m glad the niggas from my hood know I ain’t going for that
Think that we fucked up the city, how could they ever forget it
I do a lot of bad things, I hope the lord forgive me
I fucked all of these niggas bitches
And when I get that pack I put all of the [?] in it
I can’t [?] whip but I’m real good at flipping
We hit the strip club, look who doing the biggest tipping
We living, we live it up, we don’t give it up
We done fucked up a million bucks
Can’t get enough
If I’m what you looking for I’m in the back

[Hook: Ralo]
We these bitches’ dream coming true, dream team yeah
We with Mr. Clean, we be cleaning everything up
Niggas better speed up, I better speed up
I’m ten steps ahead, my partner ‘dem behind me
They say I’m living fast but it seem like perfect timing
I better speed, I think I better speed up

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Out here dodging cases, finally on probation
I used to dream of millions, now I’m finally made it
That dope boy calculation took me past my hater
My nigga Ralo serve more food than a fucking waiter
A thousand pounds of swag a week, I used to flood Decatur
Black and Migo name hotter than a radiator
300 thousand spent on ice, I got plenty paper
Yeah this rap shit saved my life, the streets tried to take me
Chasin’ dreams like I’m Meek Mill
But all my dreams came real
Niggas hate the way street live
But bitch I’m what the streets feel
Young Scooter!

[Hook: Ralo]
We these bitches’ dream coming true, dream team yeah
We with Mr. Clean, we be cleaning everything up
Niggas better speed up, I better speed up
I’m ten steps ahead, my partner ‘dem behind me
They say I’m living fast but it seem like perfect timing
I better speed, I think I better speed up

[Verse 3: Ralo]
Riding ‘round in that fast shit
Look where all the cash went
Back when I ain’t have shit
They couldn’t ask to have shit
Jump out the Bentley, hop in the Rari
Whoever rob me gonna be sorry
We get the bricks and fuck up the market
Whoever hungry gonna be starving
They want a spot on the dream team
She wanna suck on the D, D
I just been living out my dreams
Ain’t none of these niggas gon’ try me
I live a dream, I live a dream
I live a dream, hell yeah
Fucking bad bitches everywhere
I take my niggas everywhere
I thank the lord, I thank my boys
We gonna jugg, yeah yeah
We used to starve, we used to rob
Now we’s a star
We still waiting on that Bentley truck
Niggas ain’t gon’ take shit from us
We live it up, we don’t give it up
These niggas ain’t did shit for us

[Hook: Ralo]
We these bitches’ dream coming true, dream team yeah
We with Mr. Clean, we be cleaning everything up
Niggas better speed up, I better speed up
I’m ten steps ahead, my partner ‘dem behind me
They say I’m living fast but it seem like perfect timing
I better speed, I think I better speed up
