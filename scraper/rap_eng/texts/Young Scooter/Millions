[Hook:](x4)
I ain't signing no deal if you ain't talking bout them million dollars
Signing no deal if you ain't talking bout them million dollars
If you ain't talking bout them million dollars
I ain't signing no deal if you ain't talking bout them million dollars
If you ain't talking bout them million dollars

[Verse 1]
I always got a million dollar, you know I got a million dollar
The one dollar bills
If eyes I got a million dollar, tears I got a million dollar
Twenty got millions of dollars
So my problems got a million dollar, please they always poppin bottles
Fuckin a million dollar models
Reflexin on resources island
Got it off the corner man you know we got them blood diamonds
I'm a boss like Meek Mill just last in my clip fucked up ten mill
But we still in the streets steal with millions
Young school to ballin with no deal

[Hook:](x4)

But in lead of plug I told em fuck it I got another connect
Trial season out of made a million [?] to Brookshelf
Pent cold check my bed brown I got it on my shoot
No petch thought got a thing God for making [?]
I fuck with real niggas, fuck the mills like shine shout them
I got about that million dollar, her stash I thought I lost it
Do you only take you off and Mexico they on that ball shit
Braggin in the [?] bag, mother fuck the Louie shit
All my bricks 20 percent, plus I let em go for ten
Do the map if I get the whole five hundred in
Million pre-back game we get pack
So I ain't signin no deal if you ain't talking bout millions
