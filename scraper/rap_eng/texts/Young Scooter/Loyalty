[Intro: Young Scooter]
Young Scooter!
Told you I'd keep that shit one thousand nigga
Always keep it real, that's all I know

[Hook: Young Scooter]
They kill a nigga for rap fame
These labels playing money games
But they can't play the dope man
It's nothing I don't understand
These street niggas telling names
It's ugly in the dope game
Get caught with a thousand bricks and I won't tell a thing
Nigga you a snitch, you couldn't do the same

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Pac died 'bout this rap shit
Biggie died 'bout this rap shit
I probably die cookin' a brick
And all I want is money, I don't need a fix
It's flaws in the industry
You ain't who you supposed to be
Smoking mid, hood memories
Now it's two hundred dollar blunts, I'm smoking rapper weed
How I got it?
Nigga I stayed down
Lil Mexico city we got our own town
We got bricks in bails and they super cheap
Five in the morning, ain't nobody sleep

[Hook: Young Scooter]
They kill a nigga for rap fame
These labels playing money games
But they can't play the dope man
It's nothing I don't understand
These street niggas telling names
It's ugly in the dope game
Get caught with a thousand bricks and I won't tell a thing
Nigga you a snitch, you couldn't do the same

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I'm a count this change, free my nigga Tang
Way back in '09 I had a Johnny dang
Now I got six rollies, three plain Janes
Yeah I use this rap to distribute a move thing
The labels ask me will I sign (Nah)
I thought 'bout bird and didn't reply
He told me call my own shots
And he behind me til my casket drop
Me and Future la familia
I'm a young nigga, shoot chopper
Straight lean, sippin' out the pint bottle
I run the streets, I'm your favorite rapper's problem

[Hook: Young Scooter]
They kill a nigga for rap fame

But they can't play the dope man
It's nothing I don't understand
These street niggas telling names
It's ugly in the dope game
Get caught with a thousand bricks and I won't tell a thing
Nigga you a snitch, you couldn't do the same
