Intro Scooter
I can’t get no motherfuckin sleep nigga
All these haters out here
24 hours working black migo shit

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I can’t even get no sleep, cause a nigga keep on hating on me
I can’t even count my dope (count up)
Theres a hater knockin’ at my front door
I can’t even get no sleep, cause a nigga keep hating on me
I can’t even count my dope (count up)
Theres a hater knockin’ at my front door

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
It’s 12 in the morning I got five bricks left
Just sold 95 of them by my self
I ain’t been asleep the money geek me by itself
I serve my haters too but they don’t never see me there
Wanna see me down but I ain’t going back to jail
You out here in the streets better have some money for a bail
Everyday we balling eating steak and lobster tail
And everyday we jugg black miso cartel

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I can’t even get no sleep, cause a nigga keep hating on me
I can’t even count my dope (count up)
Theres a hater knockin’ at my front door
I can’t even get no sleep, cause a nigga keep hating on me
I can’t even count my dope (count up)
Theres a hater knockin’ at my front door

[Verse 2: Scooter]
They just sent the word round town
Them black amigos got them pounds (bmg)
And its courtesy of Young Scooter
Quarter million dollar jugg without my shooter
On my haters man I always turn up
Free bands I done ran the check up
My partner future he worth 10 million plus
I need to check the doctor whole year I been up (workin’)

I can’t even get no sleep, cause a nigga keep hating on me
I can’t even count my dope (count up)
Theres a hater knockin’ at my front door
