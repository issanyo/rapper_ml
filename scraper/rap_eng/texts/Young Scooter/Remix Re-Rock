[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Remix re-rockin', totin' rockets, came up in the hood I ain't have a option but to sell D (Uh!)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I remix so many bricks, sold so many splits, I done tricked so many niggas, I done hit so many licks
On the street top in my Reeboks and I'm higher than a tree top
And my choppa is on unlock, I got mo' guns than a gun shop
I got this stuck-up bitch that's smoking kush she say she got the hiccups
Smashed her in my pickup when she call now I don't pick up
I walk in, I take my mink off, smashed the bitch then washed my dick up
I know you thought I did a show, but I just dropped two half a bricks off
I never stopped trappin', I won't retire
These niggas just rappin', these niggas really liars
I smokin' on power, whippin' up powder
And these suckas buying swag but it really makes me prouder

[Verse: 2 Young Scooter]
Re-rock remix, remix re-rock
Finesse king, I got brick shops
I break 'em down, they get polished up, and put back together
Got bricks soft as leather, some hard as a rock
I put 'em on the block and then yo' traffic stops
I got all this guap from them remix blocks
My hustle never stops
I fell off I had to remix my way to the top
You want some free bands better re-rock it
I give them A-1 and then I re-rock it
You try to kick this do' you get hit wit' a rocket
Nothin' but plugs 'round me, Young Scooter the socket

[Verse 3: Yung Fresh]
Really I didn't have a choice
Early age jumped of the porch, early age I wanted a Porsche
Young dope boy driving them Rolls Royce
Dope boy got these hoes moist
You hear the dope boy in my voice
Used to remix all the things and hide my bombs down there by Ms. Joyce
Remix everything just to make a profit
Gettin' motherfuckin' money the only option
Man I can't go broke again gotta double up, double up, hustla, hustla
Baby I'mma hustla, yo' man a customer
I'm gettin' motherfuckin' money, what you know?
Used to be in yo' neighborhood sellin' them bows
Yo' front do', we sellin' them wholes
Get blunt out fast, we spend it 'til it's gone
