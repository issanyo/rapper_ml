You can get rich out the corner
Man all this made on the corner
Nigga feed the kids out the corner
Nigga I'm bout Bentley out the corner
And some real street niggas on the corner
The young niggas acting a fool on the corner
Everybody got money issues on the corner
You know you can't be slipping on the corner

[Verse 1]
The calling I'm bout the everything
These..took me a long way
Slug young nigga like the R Jay
The Joshy on the block every day
The maestro nigga we bust up
Don't talk your label talk bust all
On the corner they get their hustle on
On the corner you might lose everything
Soon..might bear everything
On the corner get it back then next day
My corner got the trial like the wrong way
Yo got only one way pleasure for my hundred play
Drive through, drive away
Salute my nigga look brick up
Get fuck out nigga got bother
Just corner forget you one year

But work nigga what you do
Don't let that corner..you

Hundred thousands pounds of swags all on the corner
And babies on vacation jet park on the corner
With a future on the road I left a bridge back on the corner
Acted back dough the nigga, brick house on the corner
Number money issues, ain't no rules on the corner
You got me buy your issue if you say you're from the corner
And smoke upon the gas got me 65 Hummer
