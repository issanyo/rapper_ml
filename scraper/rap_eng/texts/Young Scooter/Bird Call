[Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah, brrrr
Rich Gang nigga
You already know I’m making bird calls
Real street nigga

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Bird call
I ain’t serving y’all
Bird call
But I ain’t serving y’all
That’s a bird call
Flying packs in the sky, that’s a bird call
That’s a bird call
I put wings on bricks and fly ‘em to y’all

[Verse 1: Ralo]
My hood, they treat me like I’m El Chapo
You dig, I keep that dog food like I’m Ralo
I did that
They compare me to Pablo
They compare me to Meech
Look at my watch, look at my chain
They cost a brick a piece
I got it out the streets, they ain’t do shit for me
They ain’t give shit to me, I done made history
A young nigga made it that ain’t listen
Got no love for the snitches but that just come with the business
I fell in love with that kitchen, [?] all my pistols extensions
I made better decisions, put us in better conditions
Lord I know that we be sinning, I just want my niggas winning
I just hope that you forgive me, we just tryna make a living
Stack that money to the ceiling

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Bird call
I ain’t serving y’all
Bird call
But I ain’t serving y’all
That’s a bird call
Flying packs in the sky, that’s a bird call
That’s a bird call
I put wings on bricks and fly ‘em to y’all

[Verse 2: VL Deck]
Why
Ask about VL Deck
I’m still posted where it’s [?] at
Yellow tape, that’s a daily thing
Thirty clip out the 40s, look how they hang
Bird call, that mean them units in
Got this bitch sewed up from building 1 to 10
Trap houses and jugg plays
Got a nigga clutching every time I catch a play
I’m knee deep, I’m finna come K
My mama want me out the dope game
Fuck east side with Stunna
And if that shit don’t work, I’m back to the jungle

[Hook: Young Scooter]
Bird call
I ain’t serving y’all
Bird call
But I ain’t serving y’all
That’s a bird call
Flying packs in the sky, that’s a bird call
That’s a bird call
I put wings on bricks and fly ‘em to y’all
