[Hook: K Blacka]
I need money, I feed money, I see money, I take it
I don't fuck with niggas who be out on they fake shit
100 real niggas around me (x2)
A lesson to you niggas, don't you come out talking sideways
I'm the clique who with that shit, we cut a fucking niggas head
100 real niggas around (x2)

[Verse 1: VL Deck]
My niggas. my niggas, yo niggas ain't shit
Look right, BMG, cowboy, run shit
Choppas on, choppas on, don't get your ass lit
Choppas outside your home, make a nigga call [?]
Beef you don't want that, I bring it where you lay at
When it come to war time, man I AK that
Take pictures with them choppas man, you ain't gonna spray that
You ain't never seen no flamer, even never felt to keep back
You see your shooters, ain't real shooters
Superstars, we not salute you
Over here we swap it out, I take em out, and he gon' shoot you
See clearly we are not the same
Over here the clips hang
Think that bitch empty, and the choppa go bang bang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K Blacka]
Loaded guns around me, while we niggas who ready for war
Bitches can't catch shit when you know bustin' is more
I'm a boss who rap CMB
I'll shoot you up for BMG
100 real niggas around me
They fond about that streets shit
Niggas talking beef, grab the scraps, yea we're eating it
Don't know the niggas seal bottom, later on the TV bitch
All my niggas around me, you know they catching dirty snitch
I see money, my rehash then take it
Then you mind and wonder what a black can make
100% real nigga in me
What you thought about me
Got no killers with me
Bands with me, no stalkers with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: D]
BMG the cartel, with skeetes we go reeree
You don't cross the line nigga, so wish your face will be eaten
Shooters they gon' spray at me, you gon' make the TV
Must say heard about the rent, they feel shit with Uzi
I got killers out in Khaki, like I told them I ain't bout that
My project nigga get ill, fuck boi get in yo business
And If I'm in for murder, my lawyer get it or quit it
Bitch I destruct, I don't give no fuck
If you ain't ready to die, nigga then you don't wanna near with us
My shooter with that knowledge, with that 5, they leave you baken
On the pavement, shivering and shaking like caine
Cuz my nigga you ain't gon' make it

[Hook]
