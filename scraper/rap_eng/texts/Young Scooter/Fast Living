Scooter, you goin' broke, they say you flex too much
Just got a letter from the casino, say I bet too much
All my juggs complained last week, I stretched it too much
I can make a half a M, nigga, less than two months
Ace gave my first five racks, ten years old
He the first nigga I probably ever seen with a whole
Shit I grew up on the block, with the rock, young Hov
I got six spots, every room got three, four stoves
I done burned the streets up to the third degree
I got real OG's like Spook and Will with me
Rich young niggas with me, Slime and YB
I get you knocked off, nigga, please don't try me, street
