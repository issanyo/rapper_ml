[Intro:]
Yeah
Rest in peace
To the OGB
True story nigga
Let’s go

[Chorus:]
Half these niggas ain’t down for you
They’ll let you down
I went to jail
And Devil died on me
I asked God would he still [?]
I heard my partners talking down on me
Say I ain’t got
Niggas swear to God
I’m lying
Kep told me he’d die for me
That’s my right hand partner
Till I die

[Verse 1:]
Marco, Lil’ Nuke and OG Boo
Know a couple real niggas
From the horseshoe
In Four Seasons
Crip Blue
My diamonds see through
So all you fake niggas
I can see through
Broke bitches I don’t need you
In the streets how you eating
I can feed you
In all that hate
Turn into a young rich dude
I own the streets
So I can put em’ on curfew
A nigga shot your partner in the face
Tell me how the fuck you let that shit slide
Real life
No R. Kelly
Imma tell you right now
Pussy nigga
You can’t fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Went in chasing some money
Cash came with the fame
Gettin’ that junk in the game
High rollers and driving [?]
And then these niggas changed on me
Dang
These niggas ain’t the same homie
Even when I was struggling
I still had me a vision
To go chase me a million
Take all of my niggas with me
Then there was a slight change on me
Boy, my niggas weren’t the same homie
Dang
Hey Cub, remember the first time you met
Uncle Dub
In the club pouring that Moet
Gave us a glove
[?] look back nigga, nah
This shit ain’t just rap nigga

[Chorus]
