[Intro]
Yeah nigga!
I got diamonds and money
These real diamonds on me

[Hook: (x2)]
Diamonds and money, diamonds and money
Diamonds and money, diamonds and money
Diamonds and money, diamonds and money
Free bands in my pocket, and my wrist’s worth a hundred

[Verse 1]
Bundles of money; hundreds and thousands
Rolex, that’s light money; diamond chains off trap houses
Earrings with the pot money; I splurge with the cap money
Don’t fuck up the plug money; got a whole lot of drug money
I got on real diamonds, wrapped around my wrist
I jugg a lot of money cause I talk slick
Mix them diamonds with that money equal flexing
I got clear diamonds in my necklace
Saran wrap the profit from the water-whip
Mix that dope with that water; no telling what you get
I push a lot of weight, yeah I'm talking bricks
Everyday you know I'm juggin’ for that profit

[Hook: (x2)]

[Verse 2]
Wake up with my diamonds on; I sleep with my bands on me
Got a whole lot of dirty money; got a whole lot of dirty dimes
Them African blood diamonds, that Black Migo swag-pack
Know a plug in Iraq; them bricks for six stacks
But you can still melt it down, cook it, and triple that
I-I always make the work touchdown like a quarterback
More diamonds than jewellers got; more bricks than the partners got
More ice than the freezer's got; I splurge off these white rocks
Diamonds and money, fi-fifties and hundreds
Twenties and tens, Be-be-bentley’s and Hummers
Money and plug, diamonds and drug
Everyday I blow a check cause I don't give a fuck

[Hook: (x2)]
