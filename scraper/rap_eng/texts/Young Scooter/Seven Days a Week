[Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah, haha
You already know I make real street music
Yeah, real shit
Seven days a week, seven days a week
Count up (Count up), jugg
Count up (Count up)
Chophouze on the track

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Yeah)
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Jugg)
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Workin')
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Nah)
Monday, I get money (Jugg), Tuesday, I get money (Yeah)
Wednesday, I get money (Count up), Thursday, I get money (Whip)
Friday, I get money (Yeah), Saturday, I get money (Jugg)
Sunday, I get money, I'm really doin' numbers (Yeah)

[Verse 1: NAV & Young Scooter]
Last month I made like thirty racks a week (Whoa-oh)
They plot on me but I ain't losing' sleep (No-oh)
Seven days a week, I hit seven freaks (Seven freaks)
Seven days a week, got a hundred bands on me (A hundred bands)
My devil emoji chain hitting' on repeat (Bling)
Bought my whole squad plain janes, forty racks a piece
Feel like my money got no limit like I'm Master P (Uhh)
But I'm mashin' out, my chain cost a Jag
Since Scooter taught me how to jugg, the trap ain't been the same (Jugg)
Finessed a half a brick and flipped it for a diamond chain (Yeah)
Everybody 'round me changed, but I remained the same (Fuck 'em)
Got a racket, tennis bracelet, tennis diamond chains (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Yeah)
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Jugg)
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Workin')
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Nah)
Monday, I get money (Jugg), Tuesday, I get money (Yeah)
Wednesday, I get money (Count up), Thursday, I get money (Whip)
Friday, I get money (Yeah), Saturday, I get money (Jugg)
Sunday, I get money, I'm really doin' numbers (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter & NAV]
I took off, now I'm out of reach (Whoa-oh)
The streets is dirty, yeah, they play for keeps (Whoa-oh)
It ain't no limits, like free Murder, C (Whoa-oh)
Real talk, we do it for OG D (Whoa-oh)
Seven days a week, I'm countin' checks on the regular
Seven days a week, nothin' but Freebandz on my schedule
Get up off your ass and get some money, what you better do
All my niggas get money, can't hang with the broke crew
You ain't no boss, you a fuckin' worker (Whoa-oh)
If I don't know your face then I don't serve you (Whoa-oh)
Street pharmacist, I got it cheap (Whoa-oh)
No less than fifty thousand cap a week (Whoa-oh), Street

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Yeah)
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Jugg)
Seven days a week, seven days a week (Workin')
I can't get no sleep, I can't get no sleep (Nah)
Monday, I get money (Jugg), Tuesday, I get money (Yeah)
Wednesday, I get money (Count up), Thursday, I get money (Whip)
Friday, I get money (Yeah), Saturday, I get money (Jugg)
Sunday, I get money, I'm really doin' numbers (Yeah)
