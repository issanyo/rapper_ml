[Intro]
Yeah you know how it go, sacrifices

[Hook]
Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won’t sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life
I had plug ties, I had to make a sacrifice
I can never sell my soul would never sacrifice
Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
Every day I’m making jug, I don’t want your sacrifice
Make sure all my niggas cool, a lot of sacrifice

[Verse1]
Made it in the rap game they say I’m Illuminati
It’s a scarifice for who to shake they hands and found it
I’m a sacrifice the lean but I’m still on the Molly’s
Stay down on that corner till I made a profit
Look at me now, rich nigga with millionaire outfit
I see you fried I’m on the top and ain't no way to stop me
I’m a boss I don’t need nobody
I got me, put the hood on my face I know my niggas got me
Fifteen years right no license I will sacrifice
You pussy niggas buy love when that shit is priceless
You have 80mil hoe I’ll take a 40 from it
And sign a prenup when you matter she don’t have no money

[Hook]
Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won’t sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life
I had plug ties, I had to make a sacrifice
I can never sell my soul would never sacrifice
Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
Every day I’m making jug, I don’t want your sacrifice
Make sure all my niggas cool, a lot of sacrifice

[Verse2]
So sacrifice Tony stright took his life
It ain’t no sacrifice bossing joy and bricks for white
You got the juice now since he quit bitching
Kill my homeboy, I sacrificed a whole city
They kill you kid then fuck that let’s get these niggas
I wish I never ‘fronted you okay I got a kid
Sacrifice my life everyday look how I living
You can’t trust these dirty bitches
They sacrifice their lives for money
I can’t stand a petty nigga that sacrifice they life for nothing

[Hook]
Late nights, cold nights, hard south life
Made a sacrifice but I won’t sacrifice my life
Just give me sources straight up
Bitch will sacrifice her life

Sacrifice her life from early you know love is priceless
