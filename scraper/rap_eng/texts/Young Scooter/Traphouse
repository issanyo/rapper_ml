[Intro]
Pull up in anything nigga
BMMBG

[Chorus]
Pull up in that drop and niggas drop they head
I flex so damn much they say I'm goin' fed
They like "Scooter what you doin, paper chasin'?" Yeah
Everything I fuckin' touch I turn that shit to cash
Flex on you with them bands
Cook up dope in the van
Remix bricks with my niggas
Dope [?] make it triple
Flex on you with this ice
You need that Black Migo price
We plug talk with the work
I could change your life

[Verse 1]
$60K of profit got me flexin' like a retard
[?] might go get it [?]
Residue [all on the scale, the fumes] got me nauseous
Made myself a boss by pushin' packs off the porches
Your girl told her bestie my diamonds make her horny
A deuce on the four I call that shit [?]
I just had a trio with your bitch and she on Aderol
[?]
Water on my neck the shit runnin' like a waterfall
All my partners M'ed up you can say they superstar
Racks in my skin and bankroll blue like 60
I just bought a hot stickity spit shooter 50

[Chorus]
Pull up in that drop and niggas drop they head
I flex so damn much they say I'm goin' fed
They like Scooter what you doin, paper chasin'? Yeah
Everything I fuckin' touch I turn that shit to cash
Flex on you a with them bands
Cook up dope in the van
Remix bricks with my niggas
Dope [?] make it triple
Flex on you with this ice
You need that Black Migo price
We plug talk with the work
I could change your life

[Verse 2]
So much damn diamond chains and Rolex [?]
Sold so much crack in the trap I can bring Jesus back
Nigga caught with bricks and turned to snitch it ain't no need for that
Rich, broke, then rich again, I ain't goin' back
Scooter what you doin' flexin' on the feds?
We trap out them Benz and Beams and Escalades
50,000 to a quarter just give me a day
All my diamonds water you could ice skate
I could change your life
I know your plug ain't right
I know it's priced too high
And you can't really get by
I got [?] Migo numbers
Plus they cheaper this summer
I'm chargin' 24-50
But I took out 350
Scooter!

[Chorus]
Pull up in that drop and niggas drop they head
I flex so damn much they say I'm goin' fed
They like Scooter what you doin, paper chasin'? Yeah
Everything I fuckin' touch I turn that shit to cash
Flex on you a with them bands
Cook up dope in the van
Remix bricks with my niggas
Dope [?] make it triple
Flex on you with this ice
You need that Black Migo price
We plug talk with the work
I could change your life
