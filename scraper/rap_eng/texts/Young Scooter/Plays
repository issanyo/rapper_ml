[Chorus: Young Scooter / R.I.C.O.]

Plays, plays plays, plays plays

([R.I.C.O] I walk inside the spot
With a pocket full of hundreds)

Drugs, drugs drugs, drugs drugs
Stacks, stacks stacks, stacks stacks [guap!]

([R.I.C.O] These bitches really
Love it when you playing with the money)

Drugs, drugs drugs, drugs drugs
Plays, plays plays, plays plays

Drugs, drugs drugs, drugs drugs
Stacks, stacks stacks, stacks stacks [guap!]

[R.I.C.O]

I'm 'bout to bend the corner mane and catch me by
The player two
Leave it with lil buddy, it's gone take him 'bout
A day or two
Let him feed the block, we gone see what this
Yayo do
I stay in coupes and you know I kick it like a
Player do
Extra sauce, know I got that  juice just like
Flavor do
2Pac get down like [incomprehensible]
I'm an animal
Eat you pussy rappers like a meal
I'm a cannibal
Run a marathon, hit your bitch
I got stamina

This a marathon, catch up
No hamburger, thats no beef
Nigga catch a cold, nigga [Incomprehensible]
Got my bitch, staying on the grind
Get them commas up followers
Boy you better get your fucking dollars up

[Dreco]

Hey heres real talk [real talk]
Reality rap [that raw!]
Dreco probably turn that church
Into a trap! [straight up]
Wherever I'm at I roll me up loud
Mix it with crack [smell it]
Made a mill off the loud
And then I switched to sell the crack

Ask me why I did that [why?]

We was all on the news

[incomprehensible]

We came outside, we bustin them tools
You can pull up, you can get a split [raw!]
You can google my whole crew
Rico on the news [straight up]
Weezy on the news [no lie]
Dreco on the news [me too]

We did what we did, had to do what we did
But this shit that ain't cool [this shit ain't cool]
Trying to stack me a stack till I fill up my
Mac turn that bitch to a bull!

Hundred thousand stacks, all blue hundreds
I used to roll round in a hundred [gold runners]
Commas, commas commas commas commas commas
You fake ass niggas ain't one hundred [fuck you pussy niggas!]

Don't get it twisted nigga, its one black migo - gang
My jewelry iced out on my chain
Servin out the duffle bags before two chains
