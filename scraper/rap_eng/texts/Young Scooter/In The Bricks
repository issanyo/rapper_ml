We be in the bricks

We be hitting licks
That shit happen in the bricks
Finesse your plug out his bricks
I popped a foreign in the bricks

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
We in Zone 6
I be posted in the bricks
And everybody [?]
But you never see no fighting
Nothing but shots fired
Look out for the drive-bys
Every day a homicide
I will never testify

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We be in the bricks

That shit happen in the bricks
Finesse your plug out his bricks
I popped a foreign in the bricks

[Verse 2: BMG Sunny]
The bricks call me Sunny
The streets call me Slime
I hear them some millions
I can’t say that they lying
Niggas going at BMG
A hundred shots we firing
You know we got plugs on file
We can get a truckload at any time
Just shut down the city
V12 back to back
And I’m Sunny 2 Cup
Every day I pop seals and drink a rack
Draped in diamonds, Medusa heads all on my back
Juggin’ in the bricks
That’s why I keep foreigns, and I stay spending racks

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be hitting licks
That shit happen in the bricks
Finesse your plug out his bricks
I popped a foreign in the bricks

[Verse 3: Ralo]
I thank god for the bricks
Thank god for the heroin
My whole team bad
We [?] and we don’t bear none
My niggas be having them guns
They just be blasting for fun
Niggas ain’t talkin’ ‘bout none’
All of them niggas gon’ run
My pockets bigger than Pun
Niggas can’t do what we done
I own a [?]
I get them bricks by the ton
Niggas can’t even buy one
Nigga I won
I’m in the bricks with them bricks
None of my shooters ain’t never gon’ miss
We can afford some problems
We don’t avoid the robbers
We in the bricks

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be hitting licks
That shit happen in the bricks
Finesse your plug out his bricks
I popped a foreign in the bricks

[Verse 4: VL Deck]
Fuck that
Fifteen hundred, where his brain at
Officer friendly called strip and got whacked
Cameras on the poles when you pass by
Old folks hit the ground, they used to drive-bys
Niggas taking hits for gas bags now
Plenty y’all still do a brick and break down
Niggas 15 on they vans, out there foolin’ niggas
Beware bitch, ‘cause it go down in the bricks

[Hook: Young Scooter]
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be in the bricks
We be hitting licks
That shit happen in the bricks
Finesse your plug out his bricks
I popped a foreign in the bricks
