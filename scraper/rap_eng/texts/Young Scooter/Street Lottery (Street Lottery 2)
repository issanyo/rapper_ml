Streets dictionary i know everything about the streets
Im in my own lane, count music, Street Lottery !

Verse 1] Im in my own lane iont see nobody ahead of me
Pimpin out here wit me and its fuckin up my memory
Lil Scooter and his momma know i got em they depend on me
Long as my niggas happy its all good they like family
Cannot take juggs off i can't let nobody handle me

Wrote a street dictionary cuz i master mind these dirty streets
Workin out the jugg house nigga 7 days a week

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
I got niggas doin 40 max so i can't play on [?]

Take care of all the kids who the fuck you know real as me
You can give em to the kid you ain't gotta go to Tennessee
