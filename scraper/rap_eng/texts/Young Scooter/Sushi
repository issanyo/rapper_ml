[Intro]
Yeah
Eastside in this bitch, haha
Chophouze on the track
You dig?

[Chorus]
I'm a product of my environment like Boosie (Like Boosie)
Nigga, all my dope raw, nigga, sushi (Raw dope)
They keep askin', "Why you ain't did no song with Gucci?" (Yeah)
I keep countin' money, wrappin' bales in Gucci (Count up)
I had the key to the streets, way before Lucci (Streets)
Me and your bitch just made a movie, she a groupie (She a groupie)
I just pulled up in a vert, I ain't talkin' Uzi (Foreign)
I got cocaina, softer than a smoothie (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'll probably never do another song with Gucci Mane
Real talk, I did just four shows for a hundred bands
Young Scooter I took the harder way, came up like Derez
All these pussy ass niggas be snitchin', they got Ralo in the feds
I'm the king of jugg music, you pussy niggas know that
All that juggin' in your raps, you niggas should thank me for that
Sell a million dollars worth of sacks, you wanna walk in my shoes
Shit, I made myself a boss and I play by my own rules
Yeah, I'm one of the realest rappers who ever did this shit
You know half you rap niggas ain't sold a nick
I'm a product of my environment, they named me after the pavement
Street, street, Zone 6, real 80's baby

[Chorus]
I'm a product of my environment like Boosie (Like Boosie)
Nigga, all my dope raw, nigga, sushi (Raw dope)
They keep askin', "Why you ain't did no song with Gucci?" (Yeah)
I keep countin' money, wrappin' bales in Gucci (Count up)
I had the key to the streets, way before Lucci (Streets)
Me and your bitch just made a movie, she a groupie (She a groupie)
I just pulled up in a vert, I ain't talkin' Uzi (Foreign)
I got cocaina, softer than a smoothie (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I got sushi, cocaina, shit be soft as ice cream
Throw a brick and a half of remix in the re-rock machine
The dope'll moonwalk 'cross the pot, like that boy Billie Jean
My trap look like a parking lot, each cost twenty racks a piece
Ain't no limits on this money, call me Master P
Half you niggas dick riders, call 'em Master D
Ask your CEO, he probably bought some bags from me
I done seen it all before so you can't handle me
I got the key to the streets, I got the master key, makin' eighty like every week
A million dollars worth of ice, the police, they harrassin' me
They thought it was over, I recharged like a battery
I jugged a whole mil' in the hood with Alley B

[Chorus]
I'm a product of my environment like Boosie (Like Boosie)
Nigga, all my dope raw, nigga, sushi (Raw dope)
They keep askin', "Why you ain't did no song with Gucci?" (Yeah)
I keep countin' money, wrappin' bales in Gucci (Count up)
I had the key to the streets, way before Lucci (Streets)
Me and your bitch just made a movie, she a groupie (She a groupie)
I just pulled up in a vert, I ain't talkin' Uzi (Foreign)
I got cocaina, softer than a smoothie (Yeah)
