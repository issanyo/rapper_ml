[Intro: Young Scooter]
Yeah
From the apartments
Now we worldwide
I'm taking my nigga around the world

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I'ma take my niggas around the world with me
Black Migo Gang ballin' everythin'
Real dope boy known for sellin' blow
Yeah I fuck with shawty but I don't trust that hoe
We grindin' from the apartments now we worldwide
Young ghetto children now we worldwide
We ride on tour buses and private planes when we fly
Now worldwide chasing Freebandz till I die

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I don't leave the house without the pistol with me
And everywhere I go I got my niggas with me
And when I'm with a bitch I got a shooter with me
Real diamonds on cause a lot of attention
These hoes they play these games but I'm far from my lane
Finesse king, I invented the game
And I'ma stack these bands till it can't stack no more
Pull up in a helicopter pull off in a boat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: VL Deck]
Go hard, finesse, gotta make that for a least
Wipe you fuck niggas know the back we won't miss
[?] my partners, cause BMG they gon' move sum'
[?] in every clip [?] handgun
Five racks on a private flight on a real nigga for the fashion
Ten whip far scary [?] when we [?]

Ciroc [?] nigga bet you say nuttin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phil]
Trappin' [?] projects [?] dice on a private jet
Whenever Young Scooter call, I know it is about a check
Spendin' a quarter million on a coupe, and the same shit around my neck
So much money I'm lean dog, I flex with a stupid check
BMG got it now, so fuck whoever coming next
I'm [?] millionaire, if [?]
[?] wrist game [?] no check
We worldwide now, young nigga from the apartments

[Hook]
