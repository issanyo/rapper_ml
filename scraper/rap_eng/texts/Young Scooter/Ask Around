[Intro: Young Scooter]
Ya
We Top Dawg like K. Dot nigga
You dig
1865 BOG shit
Juug

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean (street)
We Top Dawg like K. Dot
Me and K$upreme (ya)
You know we be supergeeks (geeked)
Percocets, mollys, lean (do it)
At the club in a helicopter (plain)
You know I just took the scene (huh)
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean
We got a real ice
Me and K$upreme
Zamiries and Balmain (ya)
These two-thousand dollar jeans (do it)
We pull up with ten sticks
You know that's a murder scene

[Verse 1: K$upreme]
I got a real ice (ice)
My diamonds shine so bright (lit)
My diamonds shine at night (Kpreme)
Nigga, I could fuck your wife
Got some clean lean and cracked the pipe (lean)
Stick on me nigga, you know I ain't gonna fight (brrrrr)
Takin' a risk, don't go gamble with life
Slime out to Cudi, you know he real white (ya)
I'm in a trap house with Scooter (do it)
I can't go to my show without a shooter
He got exchange, it's as long as a ruler
I really be drizzlin', you wanna come through though
I'm in little Mexico, fuckin' with Scooter
Totin' an AK, ain't totin' no Ruger
These niggas they broke, they capped, they losin'
Glock on my side when a nigga maneuver

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean (street)
We Top Dawg like K. Dot
Me and K$upreme (ya)
You know we be supergeeks (geeked)
Percocets, mollys, lean (do it)
At the club in a helicopter (plain)
You know I just took the scene (huh)
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean
We got a real ice
Me and K$upreme
Zamiries and Balmain (ya)
These two-thousand dollar jeans (do it)
We pull up with ten sticks
You know that's a murder scene

[Verse 2: K$upreme]
I'm with the black Migo gang (BMG)
I got a car on my chain (ice)
VVS diamonds, my ring (ice)
Diamonds from Ice but they hit like Lou King (lit)
I'm a HotBoy, boy, I feel like I'm Wayne (Wayne)
I fucked this bitch because that nigga was lame
White on white coupe, that shit look like cocaine
I am too geeked, I feel like Kurt Cobain
I am too clean, but you won't find a stain
All hundreds on me, but you won't find no change
Bust down my watch, I don't fuck with the Plain
Magic on Mondays, we makin' it rain (Kpreme)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean (street)
We Top Dawg like K. Dot
Me and K$upreme (ya)
You know we be supergeeks (geeked)
Percocets, mollys, lean (do it)
At the club in a helicopter (plain)
You know I just took the scene (huh)
Pass around in the streets
You know my face clean
We got a real ice
Me and K$upreme
Zamiries and Balmain (ya)
These two-thousand dollar jeans (do it)
We pull up with ten sticks
You know that's a murder scene
