[Intro: Speaker Knockerz]
It's the Speaker Knockerz

[Hook: Speaker Knockerz]
Started out with nothing, I was hungry
Now I got a couple niggas' bitches on me
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
I had to make a couple bands by my lonely
Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
(Young Scooter, rest in peace to Speaker Knockerz, nigga)
I can't let a nigga run up on me
So I keep 20 sticks around me
Tony Montana, don't you play with me
Rest in peace to Speaker Knockerz, this a crazy beat
I was born in '86, I ain't got no tattoos
Another way for the police to identify you (fuck the police)
You try to ball, and go broke and gon be lonely (fo real)
Jugg, I ain't going back on E
Yeah, push that dough we movin
Lil Mexico that's Young Scooter

Independent yeah, I push my own music
A little help from Gucci and Fut, but did it all by my lonely

[Hook: Speaker Knockerz]
Started out with nothing, I was hungry

Fuck nigga, I don't wanna be your homie

[Verse 2]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, you mad, or nah?
Fuck nigga don't want war
Them things go rah-rah-rah
These thots don't get no love
My pockets is on large
I'm swimming in the guap
I got gold all on my watch
My belt cost more than your check
I'm throwing all this money like Brett
I know I make ya girl so wet
I know this pussy nigga upset
I'm winning I'm winning you lose
That's your fault should have never snoozed
You broke, never make no moves
I be making movies, no Tom Cruise


[Hook: Speaker Knockerz]
