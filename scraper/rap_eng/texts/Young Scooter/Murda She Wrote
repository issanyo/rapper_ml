[Verse 1: Cartel MGM]
You dealin’ with El Chapo, bricks like a fast speedboat
Fucked the city up like a pussy, I grabbed her by the throat
Have you ever seen a Mexican from the slums rockin’ a mink coat?
I bust because I need more, you drownin’ tryna stay afloat
I’m dancin’ like a fool, my diamonds so ice cold
My lifestyle, Mafioso, I pulled up in that two-door
Ride forth through them slums and you know I keep them drums
Joseph keep that K, and Psycho keep that pump
Ran out with them bands, I’m on that Freebandz shit
Drive-by broad day, I’m on that Flocka shit
Show me where his mama live, I don’t play that fuck shit
Everybody know I’m true to this
This that life I chose to live…

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shootouts, we undefeated
Them fuck niggas (squad) we don’t need that
He ran off with a pack, I can’t believe that (stupid)
Found out where his mama work and where she sleep at
Murda she wrote – bricks take a fast speed
Smoke every time my phone rings – c-note
65,000 for a brick of dope – they don’t want no Reekos

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Real street nigga ain’t no changin’ me
You where the rappers at I'm where them gangstas be
I fuck your girl, she thankin’ me
My shootouts they make history, muggin’ won’t do shit to me
My shooters they right next to me
Up ahead, make you rest in peace
I’m ridin’ with all felonies, guess that’s just the thug in me
My Phantom ghost Monopoly, it’s 65, you want a key
Hit the lights, I seen the folks
Make it rain on Rex Road
El Diego if you want an elbow
We got it for the low
Gangbangin’, robbin’ niggas, and we sellin’ blow
Takin’ all day, man, my youngins lettin’ forties go
These niggas know, we gon’ show that
Thirty bands in the club, we gon’ throw that (blow money)

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shootouts, we undefeated
Them fuck niggas (squad) we don’t need that
He ran off with a pack, I can’t believe that (stupid)
Found out where his mama work and where she sleep at
Murda she wrote – bricks take a fast speed
Smoke every time my phone rings – c-note
65,000 for a brick of dope – they don’t want no Reekos

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
The street’s fucked up, I’m ‘bout to up the price
65,000 for a brick of white
I took a 9 out, I never do it right
R-r-r-remix, remix, remix and let ‘em take flight
Young Scooter, yeah, I live a dope boy life
I’m talkin’ 20 shootouts and ain't been hit yet
65 licks, I done hit that
If you want 65 bricks you could get that
Interstate 65, I done jumped it
Lil’ Mexico City where my ‘hood at
Shootout (shootout) drug house (yeah)
Me and Flocka Flame ‘bout to cash out

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Shootouts, we undefeated
Them fuck niggas (squad) we don’t need that
He ran off with a pack, I can’t believe that (stupid)
Found out where his mama work and where she sleep at
