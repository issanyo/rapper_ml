[Hook]
Real street nigga (x4)
Never tell on nobody
Never sold a brick before

[Verse 1]
Pay my respect to John Gotti
Look at all the shit he did
Ain't tell on nobody
Real street niggas, they don't talk in interrogation
Folks put the pressure, on them on the investigation
But with every street nigga, I am money making
I got it at the streets too, jugged up and down the pavement
All my life, paper chasing
Fred Grant, Jessey Lincoln
And no, I ain't gang bang
I know real gang bangers
I'm a real street nigga
Can't no nigga outtake me
Most of you rappers have never seen the streets, so stop faking
Big to your hustle, know that money make you impatient
Real street nigga work the doughs at their track crazy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
You ain't no street nigga
I can see through you
Where my niggas Juggie
Where my niggas working
If you out there in the streets, money is the purpose
Gotta know to work the corner, you get time for it
In the road, run up tricks, I put my life on it
With all these plots, I could be a brick mason
With all these bags, I take money vacations
Put G's on the plot, shout a risk crazy
Put G's on my watch, got a real diamond
I never see you on the block, when I was out grinding
I got bills in the air, I got bricks flying
I'm a real street nigga, the other rappers lying

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
They gon' vouch for me
They gon' vouch for me
All the real street niggas
They gon' vouch for me
All the O.G. bossing
They gon' vouch for me (x3)
Young Scooter got a lot of street credit
Pull up in any hood and sell a hundred bills
You in the trap, you gotta have some clientele
You wanna ride foreign, gotta whip it Yale
The code of the streets is to never tell
The streets, how I eat, I eat bad meals
Just tell me what you need, I can make a deal
The streets have B.M.G working

[Hook x2]
