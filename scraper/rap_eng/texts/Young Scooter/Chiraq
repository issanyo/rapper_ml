[Intro]
Everywhere I go
I get money everywhere I go
Count 'em!
Chase is up nigga

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I'm in Chiraq I ain't gotta shoot
I went miles and shot at [?]
I'm in the streets everywhere I go
Making jewels from Chiraq to New Mexico
I'm in Chiraq I ain't gotta shoot
I went miles and shot at [?]
I'm in the streets everywhere I go
Making jewels from Chiraq to New Mexico

[Verse One: Young Scooter]
Triple beams
Hella murder scene
I got an A1 but they ain't clean
What the fuck you mean
I charge you 23
I know niggas in the [?] but who pay 43?
Bein' G that's how I eat, own the company
A young OG and I don't know a G as real as me
Li'l Mexico I ball 10 acres [?]
There's no fake, a 100 real niggas around me (around me)
Facin' 10 years but I ain't panic
They couldn't pull my fingerprints off the wrapper
My partney got up 20 for empty brick wrappers
So keep your circle tight and [?] around the step

[Hook: Young Scooter ]

[Verse Two: Lil Mouse]
We ride deep everywhere we go
My squad winning everybody know
I'm wearing plugs everywhere I go
It's 11 miles to New Mexico
Scooter hit my line and said what up lil bro
He finna slide on me then go get Heavy Lo
When we in traffic Scooter pourin' fo's
Hollows in that [?] have me rolling dough
Going to court, oh my God, you better not show
Get that word from big homie then they at yo' dour
Dressed in that black, with the Mac you know how it go
Shooter leave him in the river, make that body float

[Hook: Young Scooter ]

[Verse Three: Heavy Lo]
It's HBN in his [?]
I'm finessing right now so they thirty
Just to bring 'em in my drive I charge a whole key
I finessed then told shorty poke 'em when I leave
Niggas talk about moving bricks but movin' 63s
In New Mexico, fucking hoes and crackin' moves
Swipe for 40 Bens and spent that shit on losin' truce
I got some trill ass shooters, they gon' make the news
I only ride coups, ride them shits on 22s
It's [?], bad bitches and they lady shoes
Got money on a Sunday just to pay my dues
How my hitters come and hit 'em if that paper lose

[Hook: Young Scooter ]
