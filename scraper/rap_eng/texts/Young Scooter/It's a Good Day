[Intro: Don Q]
Yeah, today was a good day
It's a real good day to play the hood
Yeah, yeah
Yo Jamz turn me up I can't hear my shit

[Chorus: Don Q]
It's a real good day to play the hood (play the hood)
It's a real good day to hit a jug (let's hit a jug)
It's a real good day to catch the plug slippin' (catch the plug slippin')
It's a real, real good day for drug dealin' (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Don Q]
I'm about to play the strip for the night (for the night)
I don't see no plain clothes in sight (in sight)
Fleezy 'bout to make a sale for the pint
I got my work, I need my scale and my knife (need my knife)
Now don't be talkin on my cell about the price (must be stupid)
I think them crackers on my tail at the light (skrt)
They pull me over, I make bail by the night (go)
You know I'm far from sober, dropped two yellows in my Sprite (yeah, yeah)
Triflin' whore, you think I ain't never seen your type before
I might explore, soon as you stop beggin' me to pipe it raw
Had a sweet 16, a TEC, I got down to my final four
Louis V that I collect you'll never find inside a store

[Chorus: Don Q & Young Scooter]
It's a real good day to play the hood (play the hood)
It's a real good day to hit a jug (let's hit a jug)
It's a real good day to catch the plug slippin' (catch the plug slippin') (That Migo Gang)
It's a real, real good day for drug dealin' (yeah, yeah) (QP what's up)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I got on all black but Scooter sell white (white bricks)
I got niggas workin' day shifts and night shifts (night shifts)
It's a real good day to make a jug (jug)
It's a real good day to flood the hood (yeah)
Like Nike I don't think, I just do it (go)
Two hundred pounds with no license, I used to do it (real talk)
All the dope boys that I influence, ride through the hood with a Patrick Ewings
Thirty-three bricks on you pussy niggas (street), Don talk to 'em

[Verse 3: Don Q]
Ridin' 'round in the ghetto like, "Who got that Donatello?" (purp)
I fell in love with my Spanish bitches poppin' yellows
I'm above it, he got thirty shots inside the metal (metal)
On our way to Elliot to go flood out the bezels (bezels)
My shoppin' rate got me runnin' outta closet space (I'm runnin' outta space)
I operate the plays, never give my robbers brakes (I never give 'em brakes)
Hide your chain 'cause they pull up and they confiscate
Watch me dominate the game until they wide awake

[Chorus: Don Q]
It's a real good day to play the hood (let's play the hood)
It's a real good day to hit a jug (let's hit a jug)
It's a real good day to catch the plug slippin' (catch the plug slippin')
It's a real, real good day for drug dealin' (yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Don Q & Young Scooter]
Yeah, yeah, Don
Today was a good day
