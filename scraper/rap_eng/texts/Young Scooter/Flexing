[Intro]
Ay, we just flexing
Ay, ay, we just flexing
And we flexing
Young Scooter flexing

Ballin' with no D, I’m just flexin'
Yeah I'm flexin’
Young Scooter flexing
Ay, ay

[Chorus]
Thanks to my connect, now I'm flexing (Flexing)
Damn it feel good to be flexing (Flexing)
I'ma live my life just flexing (Flexing)
We at Platinum 21 just flexing (Flexing)
Ridin' through the city just flexing (Flexing)
Exotic whips back to back, just flexing (Flexing)
Eighty bands on the seat, just flexing (Flexing)
I done shut the city down, just flexing (Flexing)

[Verse 1]
Gucci's on my face, Louis on my feet
I ain't even matching, you ain't flexing like me
Young Scooter, Scooter man I always gotta flex
Best man, shawty, at my worst I'm at your best
Yeah, I got a check, stupid, dumb check
Give me my respect, Scooter ’gon finesse
After I finesse, know I’m 'gon finesse
Catch you on a dummy, catch you at your best
Damn I be doin’, Young Scooter H.A.M
Good God, damn, man we goin' stupid
Pounds in the cooler, wrapped in Saran
Ask Young Ran, I just blew a hundred bands

[Chorus]
Thanks to my connect, now I'm flexing (Flexing)
Damn it feel good to be flexing (Flexing)

[Verse 2]
Shawty out here flexing, man, where he get them cars
I know he putting on, he ain't cash out for them cars
Last year he was broke, now he made himself a star
Foreign whip shawty, foreign bitch in every car
Everyday I'm ballin', living like a super star
Shawty out here swagging, man, shawty getting off
Fuck laws in the city, I can park it in my house
Walmart numbers, got the city going, "Wow"
Visit the court, shawty, come and see what we about
Signed myself a deal and had my whole hood [?]
Thanks to my connect, he came through in the drought
Thanks to my connect, he came through in the drought

[Chorus]
Thanks to my connect, now I'm flexing (Flexing)
Damn it feel good to be flexing (Flexing)

[Verse 3]
Big steak and lobster tail, mid-grade and fish scale
Cooling downtown in the 12 counting big mail
Balling with no deal, we be flexing (Flexing)
I just hit four-eighty bands, I be flexing (Flexing)
Pussy calling up my phone, know he flexing (Flexing)
Talkin' 'bout how he go [?], know he flexing (Flexing)
I just copped a hundred bails down in Texas (Texas)
With my thick mixed bitch, I named her Lexus
Old eight nigga, we living like the Jetsons
Me and bro, we futuristic, we the present
Your crew the past, y'all niggas, you irrelevant
Big piece on my stomach just flexing (Flexing)

[Chorus]
Thanks to my connect, now I'm flexing (Flexing)
Damn it feel good to be flexing (Flexing)
I'ma live my life just flexing (Flexing)
We at Platinum 21 just flexing (Flexing)
Ridin' through the city just flexing (Flexing)
Exotic whips back to back, just flexing (Flexing)
Eighty bands on the seat, just flexing (Flexing)
I done shut the city down, just flexing (Flexing)
