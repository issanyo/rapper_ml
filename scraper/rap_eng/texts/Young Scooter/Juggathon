[Hook]
I get em every winter,spring, summer, fall
I can make them bails do a somersault
Throw em in the air, watch that money fall
I can make them bricks do a somersault
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
I'm ballin' wit these brick, I'm on a juggathon
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
200 bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon,

[Verse 1]
I'm flexin', makin' juggs, shootin' basketball
Throw them bails in the air, free bands fall
I'm standin' in the booth just like LeBron James
I got 45,000 in my gym shorts
I got flyin' past my house, look like a air port
Every other bag free when you shop with me
Thats how I like the streets, I got the recipe
My partner Big J on a juggathon
Just made it to amigo, money marathon
Juicey say he got a jugg, he wanna take em off
You know I wrap em pretty, then I dish em out
To Mexico City, everybody boss

[Hook]
I get em every winter,spring, summer, fall
I can make them bails do a somersault
Throw em in the air, watch that money fall
I can make them bricks do a somersault
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
I'm ballin' wit these bricks, I'm on a juggathon
I'm on a juggathon, I'm on a juggathon
200 bails on my wrist, I'm on a juggathon

[Verse 2]
Jugg, jugg, jugg, I'm on a juggathon,(JUGG!!!)
Count, count, count, I'm a money counter(COUNT UP!!!)
Walk in my jugg house, bricks on the counter
I get money, large amounts and bags, I don't even count em
I'm in Decatur, I'm on a jugg, I'm in Stone Mountain
Young Scooter, diamonds clearer than a water fountain
I get price of the year, nigga of the streets
Anything I do, I'mma jugg the streets
My daughter gotta eat, I gotta feed K.B
Jugg, jugg, jugg, money all I see
All these dead presidents for these jugg plays
Every damn day for me is jugg day
