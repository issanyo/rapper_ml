[Verse 1]
Everyday I chase a check, I push the bricks like that
I move a hunnid at a time I really jug like that
300 dollars in my blunt I got it laced and wet
You niggas ain't got enough dope, I could buy yo trap
I could buy a nigga ho, but I don't want a bitch
All of ya broke ass hoes y'all ain't relevant
Young Scooter on my zone 6 veterans
Ya gotta watch out who you serving, niggas telling shit
Everyday jug season gotta wake up and jug
To Mexico [?] I put my face on the hood
[?] make sure you good
I never crossed my niggas, put that shit out for

[Hook x2]
Jug season, jug season, jug season
Jug season, niggas robbing for no reason
Jug season, jug season, jug season
Jug season, tryna run up on some millions

[Verse 2]
365 ya know nigga jugging
I 95 on my way to Brooklyn
Low key dog 10 shit can't see it
I'm tryna buy nigga ho for the weekend
I know a lot of bad bitches all they do is jug
Real niggas behind the walls still making jug
4-4 jugs in 40 states to keep my pockets full
My whole hood riding and everybody jug
So everyday I paper chase I gotta take care of the fam
So I revision turn 3 hunnid to a thousand grams
Pull up on me buy 2 bricks for ya whole hands
That's 50 bands
Except bands call me jug man

[Hook]
