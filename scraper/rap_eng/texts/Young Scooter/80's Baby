Dope boy mindframe like the 90's
But you know I'm an 80's baby
Dope boy mindframe like the 90's
But you know I'm an 80's baby
Yeah they call me Young Scooter
Yeah they call me Young Scooter
Yeah they call me Young Scooter, Young Scooter
Better known as street, count music, jugg music
Young Scooter got a thousand fucking shooters

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
When you see me out with VL, Blacka and my nigga Diddy
All you pussy niggas better keep it moving
Yeah I finessed alot of niggas, robbed a nigga without a pistol
I'm the finesse king nigga you know how I do it
I was born in the 80's thank you momma congratulations
Yeah my momma was the plug in the 90's
You can ask every real street nigga
They'll vouch for what I rap about
You probably think I'm lying
Young Scooter, Young Scooter, Young Scooter
Young Scooter, Young Scooter don't move around without his shooters
I was born in the same year that they made crack
Crack baby you know my daddy was a user

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Listen to the guitar play
Listen to the guitar play
Shawty won't you sling my weight
I can't miss your face another day
Crack cocaine it was made in the 80's
Born in the same year as Young Scooter
Yeah I own a brick house, no light, trapped out
Came a long way from serving all these users
Young Scooter, Young Scooter, Young Scooter
Young Scooter, Young Scooter be repping the same hood as Future
I was born four years before the 90's
Even hit but I got 90' babies shooting 'bout Scooter
