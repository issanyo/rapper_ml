[Hook 2x]
I see a lot of rappers wearing fake gold
I ain't wear Versace jewelry no more
Black Migo Scooter got a gold stove
I got 10 chains and they all gold

[Verse 1]
Shout to to 2 Chainz but I got ten chains
I got on red bottoms I don't gang bang
Jugg house on flames call the fireman
40 thousand dollar Rollie on my left hand
BMG gold chain cost me 50 bands
Bullshit plug from China call him china man
Pound of purp for a stack it go for 4 bands
I make more than the plug I'm his boss man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fake chains turn a nigga neck green
Young Scooter I'm a human money machine
How the fuck you real and your chain fake
Why the fuck you jewelry to your court date?
Way before this rap shit the streets set me straight
I always kept it real with my nigga (?)
Juggin around the city me a money maker
Black Migo Gang we some paper chasers

[Hook]
