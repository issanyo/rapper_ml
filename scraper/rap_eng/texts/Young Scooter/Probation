[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
30 At Probation, Keep On Calling Me
Want Me To Turn Myself In & Say "Fuck The Streets"

Like I'm out Here Starving, They Gon' Give Me Something
Don't Care What The Fuck I Do, Don't Go To Court For Nothing

You Got To Pay Me For My Time Bitch, I'm From The Gutter
You Can Keep On Looking For Me, Imma' Keep On Running

[Young Scooter Prison "Check-In" Phone Call]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
The Police Asking Questions About "How's Your Case?"
They Say I Took A Million Dollars From Their State

$90,000 Cash Only Out In A Day
I Say The Word Nigga, You Could Die Today

I Just Got A Letter Just To Drug Test Me
They Know I Got Drugs In Every Intestine

I'm Always Hot, I'm Guilty At My Video
I'm Always Blowing OG Kush & Pouring 4's

Anything You Want, Nigga Pull Up
I'll Meet You Anywhere Nigga, I Don't Give A Fuck

Draw Your Pistol Down, I Won't Give It Up
Real Street Nigga, That's How We Live It Up

Now They're Trying To Charge Me With Bribery
Trying To Tie My Name In Them Robberies

I Got Aisles In The Juughouse, Lot Of Groceries
You Probably Listen To My Music; Scared To Shop With Me

But If You From The Streets, You Know How It Be
Anything For Profit When You On "E"

I'm In The Streets, Motherfuck The Industry
It's "Freeband Gang" Fuck The Police
