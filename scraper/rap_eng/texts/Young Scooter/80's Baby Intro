[Verse 1]
I was born in '86 nigga just like Drake
From the bottom now I'm here just like Drake
80's baby you know this my ninth mixtape
Real talk I know a boss in every city and state
Cheek knows [?] the bricks and [?] that OG Kush I roll that wet
Nya Nya Nya Nya Nya
What the fuck he said oh yeah you know that music wet
You know No DJ on this tape I had to bring the streets back
It was a drought in every hood I had to flood the streets with crack
Yelling out the drop top "Free Guwop" (Free Guwop)
Count music built my own lane in hip hop
You rappers think and write your lyrics I come right off the top
The shit I rap about for real and yesterday serving blocks
