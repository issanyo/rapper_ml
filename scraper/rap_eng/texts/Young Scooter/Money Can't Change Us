[Intro: Young Scooter]
Zaytoven
Yeah, motherfuckin' money can't chance me, nigga
I been have a check, street money
Count up

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Man no money can change us (Nah)
You get rich you come and shop with us (Jugg)
Took my niggas anywhere with me (Yeah)
Man the money can't change me (Count up)
And the money can't change us (Nah)
And the money can't change us (BMG)
And the money can't change Street (Nah)
Take my niggas around the world with me (Freebandz)

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I was sixteen with like thirty G's
So no money can't change me
And I jugged it all for fifty (Jugg)
All my niggas mean a lot to me (Salute)
Man no money can change Street (Nah)
Cheap bricks, I let the hood eat (Yeah)
Grind, grind, I'm talkin' no sleep (Grind)
Young Scooter, where the hood be (Yeah)
Everything change when the money come (Money come)
You gotta watch who's your partner (Your partner)
So I sleep around the robbers (The robbers)
Shootin' choppers 'bout Young Scooter's problems (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Man no money can change us (Nah)
You get rich you come and shop with us (Jugg)
Took my niggas anywhere with me (Yeah)
Man the money can't change me (Count up)
And the money can't change us (Nah)
And the money can't change us (BMG)
And the money can't change Street (Nah)
Take my niggas around the world with me (Freebandz)

[Verse 2: ?]
Money, ain't tripping, I've been rich so ain't no changing me (Nah)
I been sliding in foreign whips before we ever touched the industry (Skrt skrt)
Moving bails out of town, twenty on that pinky ring (Hold on)
My lean go down, we coast to coast
Tell these bitches to treat us like we kings
Not a rapper, real street nixer, I don't move that G
I don't need security 'cause my partners carry pistols fool
Same shit, a bigger bag, same pot, got badder bitches
Me and Scooter used to cap a sixty just like every week [?] (True story)
Me in Mexico, we hit them licks and blow them racks at Lenox
Now we state-to-state, pickin' up checks, still ride extended
Cash out on them dippers, now my whips come equipped, expensive
BMG the money can't change us, 'cause we been gettin' it

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Man no money can change us (Nah)
You get rich you come and shop with us (Jugg)
Took my niggas anywhere with me (Yeah)
Man the money can't change me (Count up)
And the money can't change us (Nah)
And the money can't change us (BMG)
And the money can't change Street (Nah)
Take my niggas around the world with me (Freebandz)
