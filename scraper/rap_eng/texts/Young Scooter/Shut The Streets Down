[Verse 1: Ralo]
I promise, we will shut this bitch down
You ain’t got to look around, I’m that nigga now
All them bitches put me down, want me to hit that pussy now
They used to call me black and ugly, I guess that I’m good looking now
Your bitches stuck in my pot of gold
I do not fuck with a lot of hoes
Tell ‘em that I’m not a pot of gold
I done came up off a pot of dope

She gon’ be beggin’ me not to go

Fuck all that shit, what you talkin’ ‘bout
Stick on me now, make you walk it out
Fuck all that shit, what you talkin’ ‘bout
I got the racks and I whip ‘em out
Shut the motherfucking screen door
Street sweeper, hit 100 rounds
10K on my neckpiece
Reach for it and I gun you down
Acting like a nigga 15 with these Dracos, I’m still riding around

One call shut the city down
Moon rocks, sell paint
When you land here got to call V
Hands in on everything
When it come to Atlanta, nigga I’m a beast
