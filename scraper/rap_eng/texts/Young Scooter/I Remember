[Intro: DrugRixh Pe$o]
Yeah, let me tell you a story
A real cold story, too
I remember the first time I saw a lot of shit
I'll never forget it, though
DrugRixh

[Chorus: DrugRixh Pe$o]
I remember the first time I saw a junkie hit a pipe
I remember the first time I hit a lick and stole a bike
I remember I had to learn this English like a sacrifice
It's something scary long along this path, but niggas seen destruction
I'm cooking crack, that shit so sour and it smell musty
Ain't no more trust, if you get close, I might just have to bust you
I'm popping Percs, I don't feel sorry for none of you motherfuckers
This shit amazing, shit so brazy, I had to stay down and get focused

[Verse 1: DrugRixh Pe$o]
It's just a blessing back then I was sleeping with the roaches
These streets get vicious, all a nigga raise is some vultures
I might get dizzy while I'm vibing 'cause I smoke the potent
My young niggas cherish murders in their pockets like tokens
The bitch just wanna fuck because I'm up, so I poked it
She wasn't going, I was on that block mugging, posted
A local joker took this DrugRixh shit global
But through this road, took this test, I had to get focused
My bitch is bad and I'm stressed
Went from projects to a jet
She sell me good dome, don't want nothing else
I'ma buy a bag for her health
I pray to live, fuck death
Come from serving crack till the death
This for all my niggas in the rest
And for all my niggas in the chair

[Chorus: DrugRixh Pe$o]
I remember the first time I saw a junkie hit a pipe
I remember the first time I hit a lick and stole a bike
I remember I had to learn this English like a sacrifice
It's something scary long along this path, but niggas seen destruction
I'm cooking crack, that shit so sour and it smell musty
Ain't no more trust, if you get close, I might just have to bust you
I'm popping Percs, I don't feel sorry for none of you motherfuckers
This shit amazing, shit so brazy, I had to stay down and get focused

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I started with a 50 slab, now I'm selling bricks in half
And I ain't have no hustle, making 60 off a 50 slab
Stayed down, had to find my [?]
I'm grinding, got these niggas mad
Dope boy Benz, I drive on Monday
Sunday, I'ma drive the Jag
I used to sleep with the junkies in the room in house
Bricks and bales, clientele going in and out
Rap money, street money, I got large amounts
I don't trust a bank with my money, I bought a stash house
Scooter

[Chorus: DrugRixh Pe$o]
I remember the first time I saw a junkie hit a pipe
I remember the first time I hit a lick and stole a bike
I remember I had to learn this English like a sacrifice
It's something scary long along this path, but niggas seen destruction
I'm cooking crack, that shit so sour and it smell musty
Ain't no more trust, if you get close, I might just have to bust you
I'm popping Percs, I don't feel sorry for none of you motherfuckers
This shit amazing, shit so brazy, I had to stay down and get focused
