Real niggas, real jewelry, we got real ice
Real bricks, real pounds, we got real pints
Real percs, real xans, we got real ice
Real dough, real jugg, we got real white

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Bitch I’m Black Amigo, you know I got real bricks
150 racks or better, you know I hit real licks
You want Xans, you want Percocets, just come to Zone 6
Yeah my hood like a pharmacy, pills and pints and shit
Bales of retail, dope hard like seashells
Ten thousand dollars, made that shit like every day last year
[?] poured it up, I got the same kind of clientele
Six fifty a pound, I got them good ganja swag bales
Really you can’t fake it ‘round them real niggas
Cause a real nigga don’t really want to deal with you
And all you fake hoes claiming y’all some real bitches
All you fuck niggas fall back off a real nigga

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Real life, real facts, nigga real rap
You only rap about this shit, I’m working real traps
Real ice, real whips, million dollar flips
If you didn’t notice, real paper bring a lot of haters
Niggas want my spot but they ain’t got what I got
I flood the city with flavors, nigga the city know me for trapping
All they know you for is sucking dick to blow up rapping
Old rapping ass nigga
Every time you see me, “Dolph, what’s happening?” ass nigga
Three hundred thou’ on ice, a million dollars on cars
They ask why I keep shitting on these niggas, I say just because
I got a whole lot of all this shit, ay!
