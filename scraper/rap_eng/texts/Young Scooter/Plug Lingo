[Intro]
Haha, yeah nigga, count up
Black migo, count up

[Verse 1]
I just hit up Avianne, told him I want clear stones (real diamonds)
I'm 'bout to say fuck this shit, it's no more talkin' on cellphones
Flyin' packs from Hollywood, coolin', juggin' out the load
When they touch Atlanta, plug prices in Lil Mexico
Jugg and finessin', they ask how I do (finesse)
Get your calculator nigga, I make count music (count up)
You can count to it (count up), smoke an ounce to it (yeah)
Or go and make a jugg, nigga this is plug music (plug)
So I speak plug lingo (yeah), remember I used to four four? (yeah)
But now it's twenty for a show so I don't four four no more (nah)
But I still got bricks though (bricks)
Hoes full of bales too (remix)
Same clientele my whole life, I just ain't servin' you (Young Scooter)

[Chorus]
The plug talkin' nigga, I speak plug lingo
Multi cocaina nigga, indoor, outdoor
Truckload nigga, that's Black Amigo lingo
Count up, that's Young Scooter lingo
We plug talkin' nigga, I speak plug lingo
Like how I sell a bird for twenty and they cost three-oh
I know Hector and he really got 'em low low
In FreeBandz meeting we speak Black Amigo lingo

[Verse 2]
My producer did this beat, shout out to Metro
A jugg want a brick right after the show
That nigga the police, I know though
I'm street smart nigga, and you know how that go though
Everybody want to be a plug but can't handle it
Soon as he get caught with a brick he start tellin' shit
That's why I finesse every new nigga, try to buy a brick
But I won't let you play me nigga, I'm the king of pullin' tricks
I'm talkin' to the labels, speakin' plug lingo
These bricks ain't goin' nowhere, I need y'all for promo
The price went down on cocaine, it ain't high no more
Remix remix remix, that's Freebandz lingo

[Chorus]
The plug talkin' nigga, I speak plug lingo
Multi cocaina nigga, indoor, outdoor
Truckload nigga, that's Black Amigo lingo
Count up, that's Young Scooter lingo
We plug talkin' nigga, I speak plug lingo
Like how I sell a bird for twenty and they cost three-oh
I know Hector and he really got 'em low low
In FreeBandz meeting we speak Black Amigo lingo
