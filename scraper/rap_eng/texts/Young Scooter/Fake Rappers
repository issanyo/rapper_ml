[Hook: Young Scooter]
Come to little Mexico you won't survive
Cause all these other rappers all they rap is lies
I wonder, can they wrap a brick in the jugg house
Don't know what a brick weigh so why you rap about it
I'm bout to put you rappers in the jugg house
See if you can work a scale, or work a block
You ain't from the streets so why you rap about it
Fake rappers wouldn't last a day on my block

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Fake rappers, welcome to my jugg house
Do you really live that life you rappin` bout
I know you don't, so what the fuck you talkin` bout
36 O`s, and them bells, come and cash-out
I dun seen a lot, out them dirty pots
You know yo shit gonna flop if you don't touch that block
Them falcon`s flew in, you know they came in flock
Word on the streets, you rappers ain't got no guap
Word to my momma I rap what I'm bout
One day shawty they goin` hand it out
Straight from the booth to the jugg house
Nigga you just rappin, I just flood the drought

[Hook: Young Scooter]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Them folk`s hit the corner nig` what would you do
I ain't talkin bout the police but the robbin' crew
He dun lost his budd man that nigga through
House full of pounds I just ran threw
We put that L.A. Reid money in the trap
Free band we plugged up, we got packs-on-packs
Them black migo`s jugs a whole lot of racks
The streets vouching for me all across the map
You can hear it in my voice, that I'm from the trap
Everyday you know I jug a different pack
I put you on the row see if you make it back
It's too much pressure for him he won't survive the trap

[Hook: Young Scooter]

Fake Rappers wouldn't last a day on my block
