[Intro]
Yeah
I feel like Lil Boosie
Shit, the world fucked up (dirty world, dirty president)

[Chorus]
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty judges (dirty judges), we got dirty cops (dirty cops)
Dirty D.A.'s (yeah), we got dirty Glocks (blat)
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty niggas (dirty niggas), we got dirty bitches (we got dirty bitches)
We got dirty birds (we got dirty birds), we got dirty pistols (blat)

[Verse 1]
I caught a four-four case, me and 4-4-G
In Ohio, felt like we hit the lottery (true story)
Same time I'm facin' trafficking, I couldn't sleep
I wish the world made everybody as real as Street
Scrape them dirty pots, get that dirty money
I got clean hundreds but I got dirty twenties (count up)
I know dirty judges, I'm talking cars to london
Dirty cost like Channel-man, chase you, take your money
So many niggas behind the wall, every day they call (damn)
They took my lil brother from me, it got me throwed of (K Blacka)
Dirty D.A.'s, put you in the box
They gave Lil Toe eight years for shooting at the opps

[Chorus]
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty judges (dirty judges), we got dirty cops (dirty cops)
Dirty D.A.'s (yeah), we got dirty Glocks (blat)
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty niggas (dirty niggas), we got dirty bitches (we got dirty bitches)
We got dirty birds (we got dirty birds), we got dirty pistols (blat)

[Verse 2]
A lot of dirty labels, check your contract
You was broke when it happened, that's why you signed that
I was in your same position and I signed that (true story)
And then I took a boss position, bought my contract (Scooter)
You can't be Freebandz if I don't stamp that
'Cause I'll send the vamps where you lamp at (blat blat)
Hit up Eliantte, that's an ice attack
Pull up with five sticks, you have a heart attack (yeah)
It's a dirty dirty dirty world that we livin' in
It's money over everything, it's all about the benjamins
A lot of dirty lawyers, niggas disloyal
Dirty ass nigga, I can't do nothin' for you (street)

[Chorus]
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty judges (dirty judges), we got dirty cops (dirty cops)
Dirty D.A.'s (yeah), we got dirty Glocks (blat)
It's a dirty world (dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
It's a dirty world (it's a dirty world), it's a dirty world (it's a dirty world)
We got dirty niggas (dirty niggas), we got dirty bitches (we got dirty bitches)
We got dirty birds (we got dirty birds), we got dirty pistols (blat)
