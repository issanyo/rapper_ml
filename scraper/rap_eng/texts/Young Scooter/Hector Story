[Intro]
Wake, wake up in the morning; crank that 18 wheeler
Hector hit my phone; I'm gone in his direction
He say he out the game; he left it up to me
Gave me a road map and spots overseas...
Aye Izzo, bring that shit back nigga
I see these street niggas fuckin’ with me

(Dj Swamp Izzo talks)

[Verse 1]
Wake, wake up in the morning; crank that 18 wheeler
Hector hit my phone; I'm gone in his direction
He say he out the game; he left it up to me
Gave me a road map and spots overseas
He say amigo crossed him; he ain’t keep it real
I told him, “How the fuck you gon’ let him live?”
He say that's his brother by his wife kids
I told him, man that nigga fucking up my mill
I say, he gotta go so suck up your pride
I make a mill a week, you how I survive
He say he gotta drive; I told him I'll drive
Them folks looking for him; so he don’t come outside
Mon-money conversations: have them underground
He say he’ll give me what I want to put them bricks down
Cause these niggas get caught and try to take you down
Nothing but bosses in my circle; ain't no squares around
Count up! Cause I got squares around
Some are 30 thousand...25 thousand...15 thousand...75 hunned
I'm the remix king, none of my bricks one hunned
Real road runner, road runner music
Anything I say you traffic bricks to it
I-95, I done did that
I-20 East, drove my own packs
‘75 North, a lot of free bands
Young Scooter done draped up an ambulance
You know it hold 500 swag bags
I send them 65 down to Louisville
I-10, I know some O.G.'s worth a lot of mill
I'm leaning on that pill; I'm on that Texas shit
I mastermind them back streets of Barrel City
Add up them trucks I’m road runner gettin’ it

[Outro: (x3)]
Road runner, road runner
This road runner music, you a road runner
