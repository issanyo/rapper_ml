[hook: Casino and Young Scooter]
Big bags, good gas, get cash (get the cash baby)
Big drip, big splash, I spill (I be spilling shit)
Big foreign, big jet, no deal (ain't no dealing with it)
Big cuban, big charm, I'm lit (man we lit in this bitch)
Big forty, big clip of stick (of this stick and shit)
Big bags, good gas, get cash (get the cash real quick)
Big drip, big splash, I spill (I'mma spill this shit)
Big foreign, big jet, no deal (ain't no dealing with it)

[Verse 1: Casino]
Charm around my neck a thirty six
Forty around my hip it hold a thirty
Taliban around ain't got no worries
I'm geeked in a Tesla rolling early
Yo' bitch sucking dick, it's seven thirty (good lord)
Bitch suck the dick, the birds chirpin (good lord)
I fucked her friends, sister and her buddy (good lord)
Casino going crazy seven thirty (good lord)
I just made you a deal on a birdie
I just signed your deal on the birdie
I just want the racks in a hurry
The bags dropping in, I got good weed
Lord I'm a inner-city, they can't stand me
I'm gone 24/7 of the addie
They broke playing to the left, get from around me (go get some money, it's friday bitch ain't no credit)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I ain't got no deal but you know I get big checks
Rolex richer mills, APs and Pateks (Aliante?)
Ain't no love for you pussy niggas, it's always disrespect
Respect the shooter, we paying pictures nigga come through with  that tec
Do it big can't do it small, spent a hundred racks at the mall
Don't kill my vibes like Kendrick, you know Scooter I'm topdawg
You know sky is the limit, I'mma ball till I fall (ball)
Scooter has big stones, [?] cuz baguettes (real diamonds)
Keep it real, never eat it long, let everybody get a check
Do it big like Boosie Webbie, me and Casino we gone flex
Do it big pussy nigga, I can't do it small
It's a must that I do it big for the niggas behind the wall (street)
