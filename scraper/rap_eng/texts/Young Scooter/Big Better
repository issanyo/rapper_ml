[Intro]
[Young Scooter]
You know I'm a big better
Black Migo Gang
I got too much money to be holding this shit

[Hook]
Walk out a casino with a half a mil
I'm a big better, I'm a big better, I'm a big better
I bet LeBron win that shit again
I'm a big better, I'm a big better, I'm a big better
I say Floyd never lose a fight
I'm a big better, I'm a big better, I'm a big better
Black jack they gotta pay me twice
I'm a big better, I'm a big better, I'm a big better

[Bridge]
Left right, right, right, hit 'em Mayweather
Hit 'em Mayweather, hit 'em Mayweather, hit 'em Mayweather
Every stack I bet you twenty, nigga
I'm a Mayweather, I'm a Mayweather, I'm a Mayweather

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
45 and 0 and out of that he knocked out 26
Ortiz tried to sneak a shot he knocked him out for that shit
Why Floyd ain't fight Pacquiao? He know his tests ain't legit
Back with the money team, automatic double lip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Crunch time fade-away LeBron all net
For every stack I bet you 50,000, call the check
He the best to play the game but still ain't finished yet
I'm talking crazy with the rock, how he kill them with finesse
Back to back championships, now it's time to three-peat
Black on black Rari that I bought, beating with the Heat
LeBron running circles around you jerks, like a track meet
Put you on a poster, talking 360 backing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Fastball, Red Sox
Bird call, Seahawks
Real nigga, green dot
All of my brothers we don't even got the same one
Floyd Mayweather, Floyd Mayweather
Bird crank that G5, move in any weather
Nigga winning like Kobe (???) is still together
No disrespect to Jordan, LeBron gon' be way better

[Hook]
