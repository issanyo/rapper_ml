[Intro]
Yeah
You know I had to make a whole lot of drug deals to get where I'm at nigga
For real

[Chorus]
I got it off of drug deals (count up)
My whole life a drug deal (street)
I got rich off drug deals (jugg, jugg)
I made a lot of drug deals (count up)
My mama hate the way I live (yeah)
Like why the hell you sellin' drugs still?
That's how I built my name, off drug deals (drug deals)
I blew and made millions off drug deals (yeah, street)

[Verse 1]
I be smokin' weed and poppin' pills (yeah)
I got million dollar ad-libs (count up, jugg)
Right now I'm in my bag still (street)
You know I'm ballin' with no deal, yeah (flex)
This a dirty world, everybody on drugs
Real talk I used to bust a thousand pounds in the tub
Rich Homie said, "I'll never squash my problems with Thug"
But really he was super geeked up off them drugs (street)

[Chorus]
I got it off of drug deals (count up)
My whole life a drug deal (street)

I blew and made millions off drug deals (yeah, jugg)

Black Amigo Gang, we run a street pharmacy
We got bottles, pills, lean, percocet, ecstasy
If you ain't worth a half a million don't you stand next to me
Used to sell two thousand pounds a week and got it for free
I really rap the shit I live (street)
Every day I make a drug deal
Future got his name off drug deals (yeah)
Seventh letter worth a couple mil (G)
I'm a Freeband nigga so I'm all 'bout the drug deals (Freebandz)
Neighborhood dope boy, could sell out the club still
A hundred pounds for a hundred thousand, you know I got them plug deals
I'm a walking drug, so you know my whole life a drug deal

[Chorus]
