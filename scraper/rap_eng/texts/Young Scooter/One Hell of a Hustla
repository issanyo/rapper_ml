[Hook]
Yeah hustlers all I know is counter

Yo scudo a one a hell of hustler
Oh one hell of a hustla

[Verse 1]
I run a kartel got way more than brick fell
And I know essays that sleep what
Know all of you can’t even show there face
Then in the house find you
20 thousand for a show without a record deal
I pop ferrari in the hood and ain’t even no doubt about it
When I popped up in that hood bitches crow around
Is just too much going on so I just move in silence
Ten toed down jigga nigga that’s how I got it

Yea this is for all my hustlas
Ye I do this for my hustlas
And don’t you trust every customer

[Hook]
Yo scudo a one hell of a hustla
A one hell of a hustla

And you just a customer

[Verse 2]
I hustle grand and stock it I’m a trap addict
You can’t play me by my check I know mathematics
Drug lords and bells comes in white relm
On the weekend I’m a rapper through the week I’m a trapper
And I don’t keep it five hours when I get a package
When those girls have a shower let the streets have it
I got hustler habits chains 20 carrots hustle up on it
Remember I didn’t have it
Yea yea this is for my hustle bitches
Who get money without me nigga
Yea and they for my boss nigga

[Hook]
Yo scudo a one hell of a hustla
A one hell of a hustla
A one hell of a hustla
A one hell of a hustla
Me I’m a boss man
And you just a customer
A one hell of a hustla
