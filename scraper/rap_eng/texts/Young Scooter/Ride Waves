[Intro]
Yeah, haha
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves
Haha, yeah
Chophouze on the track

[Chorus]
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Yeah)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (I don't ride waves)
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Own wave)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Count music)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Cars and planes)
Salute the real bangers, but I don't gangbang (Jugg)

[Verse 1]
I don't gangbang, I let my chain swang
I ain't in the rap game, I'm in the dope game
All you dickriders goin' to the hall of fame
Young Scooter, Street, I got two names
All my friends are dead, bitch, I'm talkin' bout racks
Them dead presidents, I got a lot of that
If a nigga play with me, I tell him, "Roger that"
Five hundred pounds a week a year, I pre-order that
I ain't got no surfboard, bitch, I work for it
I'm Lil Mexico's landlord
The only rapper seen more pounds than Boston George
Freebandz a circle full of bosses, boy

[Chorus]
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Yeah)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (I don't ride waves)
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Own wave)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Count music)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Cars and planes)
Salute the real bangers, but I don't gangbang (Jugg)

[Verse 2]
I'm a wave creator, I know construction, a brick decorator
I really came from nothin', I'm from the slums, you was born a hater
Really jugg truckloads, spot hotter than a radiator
Black Amigo, Freebandz, we turned that shit into a label
Create my own wave, I made millions off it
Treat the trap like Lauryn Hill, how I kill 'em softly
I always got 'em on my face, it ain't never cost me
Nigga, I re-up with nothin', still plug talkin'
Hundred racks in the Fendi back
Two-hundred racks in that Louis bag
I only sell swag weed, but I smoke real gas
Hundred pounds in the trash bag
Throw 'em in the trunk and hit the slab
Most of you niggas be dickriders, broke as hell with no cash

[Chorus]
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Yeah)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (I don't ride waves)
Create my own wave, built my own lane (Own wave)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Count music)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I don't ride waves (I don't ride waves)
I don't ride waves, I ride cars and planes (Cars and planes)
Salute the real bangers, but I don't gangbang (Jugg)
