Kyeahh!
You know im riding 'round the city juugin'
These niggas don't understand this shit man
Im on a motherfuckin paper chase

[Hook (X2]
Im on a paper chase
Im on a paper chase
Im on a paper chase
Im on a paper chase
I say im ridin round the city and im juugin
Im ridin round the city and im juugin

[Verse 1 - Young Scooter]
Ridin through the city, stuck in traffic, me and casino
Known for drug trafficking the work in 'lil mexico
Cartel shit, clean work no
Good prices through, plus you can double yours (Holy Sh-)
And shit I know it cost $270,000 for it
It's worth it, you can make a million dollars twerkin'
Im certain, I get them bales and I wrap 'em perfect
Im working, I can hear them dead people talkin
Im after them, cuz you know im tryin to rubber band them
Scooter got a dope boy vision, they can't stand him
Especially, when im on a paper chase I dummy them
My specialty, freebands nigga I want all of them

[Verse 2 - Young Scooter]
Im ridin through the city, I got prices lower than you
I can serve whatever I dont fuck with dog food
Whenever, however I get them off and splurge through
I flex so much I never know my next move
Ridin past the aston martin all orange guts
Off tan bricks man you know I fucked them up
Im on a juug-a-thon counting, running bands up
Im on a paper chase them old hundreds band up
Swag bales, stacked up all the work whipped up
Im ridin thru the city straight juugin free bands
You buy a hundred pounds get a free ten bands
You want that A1 holla at Future I remix a nigga' ass
