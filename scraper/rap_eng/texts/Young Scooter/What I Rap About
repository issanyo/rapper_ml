[Hook:Young Scooter]

I don't play on beats I'm from the streets

You're favorite rappers a pussy he ain't street
He ain't eat so he don't do the shit he rap about
I don't listen to you nigga's music rap to many lyrics

Cause this cocaine shit i rap aboout (remix)

[Verse 1:Young Scooter]
Cocaina diamonds wet like aqua fienda
50 bricks in the speakers

You know everything i do illegal
The streets talking like scooter we need you
Cause i rap about the shit that you going through (true story)
And everytime its a drop i come through

Everyday they go in and out i was born in the streets raised
By the og s so the street shit all i rap about
