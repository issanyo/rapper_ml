[Chorus:]
Juug house rollin doin' numbers and we got cooked crack
I give a damn if the work don't lock nigga you can't bring it back
Juug house rollin doin' numbers I done took the crazy bag
Anything I touch I turn to money I'm juugin' for them free bandz

[Verse 1:]
Juugin' for them free bandz and now it cost you 6 bandz
Two colors white and tan I cook dope in a frying pan
I'm known as the dope man, bitch I never hold hands
All I do is count bandz a trap god like Gucci Mane
Juug house rollin doin' numbers our daily job
Scooter make the moves with the rock like a point guard
10 thousand spent on choppas let my young niggas do the job
100 bricks right out the boat my cousin a coast guard

[Chorus:]
Juug house rollin doin' numbers and we got cooked crack
I give a damn if the work don't lock nigga you can't bring it back
Juug house rollin doin' numbers I done took the crazy bag
Anything I touch I turn to money I'm juugin' for them free bandz

[Verse 2:]
We got bricks and we got bails and we got cooked crack
100 bails don't need no scale that's how I move that
You dropped the brick brought back a half you can't get shit back
I'm talking 55 percent you get 3 bricks for 60 racks
Juug house rollin doin' numbers and I can't trust a soul
I spent a quarter million dollars all on jewelry I'm talking gold off dough

[Chorus:]
Juug house rollin doin' numbers and we got cooked crack
I give a damn if the work don't lock nigga you can't bring it back
Juug house rollin doin' numbers I done took the crazy bag
Anything I touch I turn to money I'm juugin' for them free bandz
