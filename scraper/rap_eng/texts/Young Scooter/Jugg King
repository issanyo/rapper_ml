[Chorus]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned

[Verse 1]
I'm a real nigga
Lick hitter, bitch getter
Quick flipper
Pot whipper, dope dealer
Fly nigga
If I pop I'ma ride nigga
Goyard
A hundred racks inside nigga
You a fuck nigga
I could get you touched nigga
I be in your hood
So I know what's up with you
You a worker nigga
Hang around plugs nigga
You the dope man
You ain't got no drugs nigga
I'm a boss nigga
I'm bossed out like Rick Ross nigga
Five-fifty Benz
You know what that cost nigga
My shit paid for
You paid a note, you ridin' a rental
I got Freebandz
You know Future that's my nigga, Scooter!

[Chorus]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned

[Verse 2]
Real dope boy
Nigga you a ho boy
You move a brick a month
That means your trap too slow boy
Every day I stunt
I put on a show boy
You ain't got no money
Nigga you a broke boy
I do what I want, I got real cash
They call me the Jugg King
'cause I got real swag
I ain't talking clothes
Bitch I got them bands
You know this a pound house
And we don't sell halves
I'm a boss nigga
Yeah I took a loss nigga
If you in the streets
Watch out for the cross nigga
I don't trust niggas
'cause I can't take no loss nigga
I got Freebandz
Yeah Casino that's my nigga, Scooter!

[Chorus]
You say you a hit man but you ain't hit shit
You say you a lick man but you ain't hit no licks
You say you a dope boy but you ain't sold no bricks
My baby mama left, I bought another nigga's bitch
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
I do what I want, you do what you can
I stashed away a mil just if shit don't go as planned
