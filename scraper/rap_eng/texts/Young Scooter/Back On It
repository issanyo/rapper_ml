[Intro: Young Scooter & Offset]
Yeah, haha
You already know it's that muh'fuckin' Trap Holizay
(If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Got Offset with me
The best producer alive, Zaytiggy, yeah
(Zaytoven)
You know what I'm sayin?
You can't get on Zay' beats without wrappin' cocaine, nigga
Yeah, real dope boy
Offset, takeoff on these niggas
Woo, woo, woo

[Chorus: Offset]
Walk in the club with the cash on me (Cash)
Gang in the club with the strap on 'em (Gang-gang)
I cut you off, turn your back on me (Cut)
I hit a lick, double-back on it (Huh)
I got four dubs who want back on it (Woo)
Stuck in the kitchen, the MAC on 'em (Stuck)
Stuck in the pot cookin' crack on 'em (Stove)
Perky and Molly, I'm back on it (Woo)

[Post-Chorus: Offset]
Bitch, I don't play with that money, no (No)
Boy, what you say? Got a mil' of those (Woo)
Don't dunk a brick, rather finger-roll (Finger-roll)
Bitch ridin' dick on her tippy-toes (Agh)
Fuck all this pack, nigga, fuck all this fame (Uh)
Nigga, I'm up like I'm sellin' cocaine (Woo, woo)
Takin' this jet to Quebec in this fame (Woo)
My pockets loaded, can't walk, need a cane (Loaded)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Great Dane, big dog, continental, blue frog
Pumps sawed-off, what a good day to cut the top off
Playin' with the gang get you knocked off
It was all games 'til we popped off
MAC-11 sprayin' like salt, diamonds shinin' when the lights off
I don't care about the price, dawg
Dominican bitch with some nice jaw
Creepin' in the night with your lady
Niggas hate it, but we been the greatest
Never lazy, pull up in the latest
Your pockets slim and you real shady
I'm with the mafia, cookin' tilapia (Cookin' tilapia)
Shawty real popular, her not the opposite (Her not the opposite)
That money you flexin', I know that this all of it (That's all of it)
Won't text you 'cause I can't wait to just stall a bitch (Stall a bitch)

[Chorus: Offset]
Walk in the club with the cash on me (Cash)
Gang in the club with the strap on 'em (Gang-gang)
I cut you off, turn your back on me (Cut)
I hit a lick, double-back on it (Huh)
I got four dubs who want back on it (Woo)
Stuck in the kitchen, the MAC on 'em (Stuck)
Stuck in the pot cookin' crack on 'em (Stove)
Perky and Molly, I'm back on it (Woo)

[Post-Chorus: Offset & Young Scooter]
Bitch, I don't play with that money, no (No)
Boy, what you say? Got a mil' of those (Woo)
Don't duck a brick, rather finger-roll (Finger-roll)
Bitch ridin' dick on her tippy-toes (Agh)
Fuck all this pack, nigga, fuck all this fame (Uh, yeah)
Nigga, I'm up like I'm sellin' cocaine (Woo, woo, [?], nigga)
Takin' this jet to Quebec in this fame (Woo)
My pockets loaded, can't walk, need a cane (Loaded)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Do it for the streets (Yeah, do it for the streets)
Let e'rrybody eat (Yeah, let e'rrybody eat)
Sell dope on beats (Yeah, sell dope on beats)
BMF, BG (Skrrt, BMF, BG)
YSL (Slime, YSL), Offset, QC ('Set, Offset, QC)
Four pockets full (Count up, four pockets full)
Everyday for the streets (Yeah, everyday for the streets)
Walk in the club with a hunnid rounds
Everyday I leave the house, got a hunnid-thou' (Yeah)
Nigga turn up, get turned down (Turned down)
Everyday 'round street, it go down (Go down)
You ain't no boss, nigga, you a ho ([?])
I used to get money with your CEO ([?])
The second rich nigga from Lil' Mexico ([?])
You never did straight business, had to stretch the blow (Free Meek)
Me and Offset, we count up checks (Count up)
My jewelry box got ten Rolex
Used to be broke, that's why I flex (Flex)
A half a million 'round my neck (Count up)

A wish a nigga turned his back on me, I get him whacked, pronto (Street)
