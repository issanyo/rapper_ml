Feat. Ca$h Out

[Chorus]
The streets will never be the same again
Nobody wanna go to jail no more
The streets will never be the same again
For what is all they put the trap too slow
The streets don't change, nigga telling name
Keep it low key if you got cocaine
And I'm just trying to get my paperwork
But I ain't trying to be no nigga paper work

[Verse 1]
You niggas get caught with bricks
And don't even do a thing
You nigga rap I'll, next time they turn gay
I'm in the trap still, I push a lot of weight
A nigga caught what is all in a year and that's okay
I get caught when it's all a thirty day for day
Ask be fake so beats a lot of rappers in the way
I teach you how to cook the dope rap and then say yay
You made the wrong move, won't see your family another day

[Chorus]
The streets will never be the same again
Nobody wanna go to jail no more
The streets will never be the same again
For what is all they put the trap too slow
The streets don't change, nigga telling name
Keep it low key if you got cocaine
And I'm just trying to get my paperwork
But I ain't trying to be no nigga paper work
Nobody wanna go to jail
Every nigga don't wanna no bail
So what they mean they know but they don't tell

[Verse 2]
Have the niggas switching numbers
Got fans pulling up in them homes
I don't know you, nigga
I told them niggas I'm working at patchwork
Take a brick, put it together, call that patchwork
Give my shit, a hundred percent shit, we can matchwork
No more ready, use my wrist, let's see if that work
And I always gotta keep protection
You're protected by police, witness protection

[Chorus]
The streets will never be the same again
Nobody wanna go to jail no more
The streets will never be the same again
For what is all they put the trap too slow
The streets don't change, nigga telling name
Keep it low key if you got cocaine
And I'm just trying to get my paperwork
But I ain't trying to be no nigga paper work
