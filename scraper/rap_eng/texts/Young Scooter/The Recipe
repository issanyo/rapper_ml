[Hook: Young Scooter]
All you pussy niggas coppin’ pleas
Like you convicted a felony
You lil niggas ain’t beefin’ ‘bout money
You might as well call off all beefs
Turn fifty to 200 Gs
Bitch I got the recipe
Black Amigo, we speak guapanese
You can hate but ain’t gon’ fuck with me

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
You gotta watch who you sell that dope
Because these pussy niggas coppin’ pleas
I do what the fuck I want, bitch I’m a street lottery
Trap runnin’ like 24, we got indoors, we got outdoors
We take a week to sell 20 pounds
But fuck nigga your trap slow
I got truckloads like Costco
I got tons of gas like Texaco
Hundred real niggas ‘round me
From Edgewood to Lil Mexico
Trap house with no doors
A couple mill out the dope bowl
I see through these fake ass niggas
And no I do not trust hoes
You niggas ain’t beefin’ ‘bout money
You niggas rather beef ‘bout a bitch

[Hook: Young Scooter]
All you pussy niggas coppin’ pleas
Like you convicted a felony
You lil niggas ain’t beefin’ ‘bout money
You might as well call off all beefs
Turn fifty to 200 Gs
Bitch I got the recipe
Black Amigo, we speak guapanese
You can hate but ain’t gon’ fuck with me

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I got to ride with the rifle
I got to ride with the bible
I got to keep it beside me
I got to keep it beside me
I got a book bag beside me
It got a QP inside it
I’ma hit hard when we [?]
Young Guapo might start up a riot
We did this shit for the streets
I count up the money with street
Young Guapo don’t fuck with you creeps
Get it back in every week
Niggas been callin’ off beef
Talkin’ ‘bout 200 to 3
We know you gon’ cop a plea
You was never in the streets
Don’t know you, I speak guapanese
We want them pints and them Ps
[?] Hendrix with me
Got too much money on me
Smoke on that reefer and choke
Scooter just got off a boat
Got shooters you know that they toke
Young Guapo, I’m far from a ho
