[Intro]
Motherfuckin' money can't change me nigga
Been' had a check
Haha street money


[Hook]
Money can't change us
You get rich come and shop with us
Take my nigga's around the world with me
Man, no money can't change me
Ain't no money can't change us (2x)
Ain't no money can't change street
Take my nigga's around the world with me

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I was 16 with 50 g's
So no money can't change me
And I [?] off of fifty
All my niggas mean a lot to me
Ain't no money can't change street
Cheap bricks I let the hood eat
Gran gran talkin' no sleep
Yo, Scooter where the hood be?
Everything change when that money come
You gotta watch who you call your partner
Niggas sly so I sneak around the robber
Shootin' travels but we all on Scooter problems

[Verse 2: BMG Sunny]
Money ain't trippin I been rich so ain't no changin' me
[?] was before we ever touch the industry
Movin' bills out of town
20 on my pinky ring
[?]
Now a rapper real street
[?] that street
I don't worry 'bout security
Cuz' my partners carry pistols
Same shit big n' bad
Same plot got bad up bitches
Me and Scooter used to cap a 60 every week I meant it
Me and Mexico we hit them licks and blow them racks all in it
Now we settin' stakes
Pickin' up checks
Still I will extend it
Cash and I won't [?]
Now n' my whip, call me crazy expensive
BMG the money can't change us
Cuz' we been eatin'

[Hook](2x)
