Hook:
I got flying packs landin on the runway
25 hundred pounds sold in one day
19 jugg houses on a one way
I just count up 3 million dollars in one day
I got flying packs landin on the runway
25 hundred pounds sold in one day
19 jugg houses on a one way
I just count up 3 million dollars in one day

You know I rap my bricks in the parachute
I send em to your dawn nigga I could fly
So everywhere I go I got them AC's with
They turn me to a black amigo mama tish
Every time my talk the..will be talking mean
We gotta understand that we can't cross each other
We live by the cold, we like club brothers
I don't spend the whole lot of drug money
300 dollars run for whole..
I just bought a mention not for role running
I just cat..the rari out for 8 diamonds
200 bricks in the L bricks storm coming

Connected with the plug, so while I do his jug
Breaking down cocaina so you know I double up
Hustle every day so one day I'll be rich as f*ck
Stepping on my toe will have me shoot from the neck of
First class kush pack, shout out to my dog habs
Running to the money in and out like I'm running abs
Weak house, they house, got all kind of different traps
Up city on other timers I make stupid caps
Got me no bounce while a cube hoe, give me that
Drug throw me bricks and bale
Bitch I ain't gotta big
2 chains on my moe beyond superflex
Me and scooter slipper strong while we count checks
