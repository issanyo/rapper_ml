Feat. Bun B

[Chorus]
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery

[Verse 1]
I'm the street's dictionary
January to January
I'm after money, cocaine runner
I got odd numbers, 3 40 for a pile, let me go number
That noter out in the street if he want some money
I always keep it real, never snitch in front of you
When I was nine years old I didn't have a lot of money
Dad inspired me to get money
Now I'm riding in the Porche thinking
I think I'm beying franklins
I was young, my momma had a package
I was born as a round rapper

[Chorus]
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery

[Verse 2]
Back in the days when I started the game
It was all about the loyalty, the cast that feel the same
It was all about getting down together for the change
It was all about the fame and fuck whoever came
We was young, but down for each other in the trap
Fighting in the streets way before we had the straps
Fucking on these hoes way before we had the money
So niggas gotta pay in store, acting funny
We understood the rules and the cause of the Gs
Never beet for the pussy, just money or the cheese
To go from BGs to OGs, that's how it's gotta be
Is the young trio niggas, we're the street's lottery
For real, nigga

[Chorus]
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery

[Bridge]
Growing out as a young nigga, everybody wants to be a boss
Have to build my own lane, I could show OG how to ball
I know everything about the streets, never did time behind the wall
I know some young niggas gone, never coming home, behind the walls
Who had no money for a lawyer
Probably defended their destroyer
Cases beat with a lawyer
You a young nigga, this how they try to spoil you

[Chorus]
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery
Growing up as a young nigga
Young nigga running with them OGs
I know the streets in and out, nigga
You can call me the street's lottery
