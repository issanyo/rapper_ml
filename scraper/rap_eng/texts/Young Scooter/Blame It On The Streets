[Intro: Jose Guapo]
CO[?]
Sometimes, the streets the only thing a nigga know
For a lotta, lotta niggas, ya dig?
Thats the only thing they know
Let's get it

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
See we get so much money, it's a damn shame
Real street nigga, nigga don't give a fuck 'bout fame (fuck)
And how I'm feelin', fuck, I might go cop a China dame (China dame)
And I was raised in the streets so the streets to blame (streets)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Don't blame it on me, blame it on the streets (let's get it)

[Verse 1: Jose Guapo]
I go crazy with the money, need a psychiatrist (I go crazy, ho)
I drank Act, I drank red, don't drink Qualitest (I don't drink it, ho)
Got a homie out the feds, gotta clean his piss (four fo' a g)
And I ain't new to this, nigga, naw I do this shit (let's get it)
Every time I be with street, we in the street (street)
These niggas mad 'cause I had their BM in my sheet (big ol' facts)
I'm in the Vette it sit too low, can't hit the concrete (I'm in the Vette)
I go gorilla on these pussies, they some monkeys
I got my gang from the street (street), I keep them Raf K's on me (yeah)
We know you broke you a leech (yeah), AP on me on fleek
They know what happenin', they know I ain't cappin' (I ain't cappin')
They know I ain't just rappin' (I ain't rappin'), I know she really [?]
Hell yeah, I'm fuckin' right, I'm vouchin' (I'm vouchin', bih)

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
See we get so much money, it's a damn shame
Real street nigga, nigga don't give a fuck 'bout fame (fuck)
And how I'm feelin', fuck, I might go cop a China dame (China dame)
And I was raised in the streets so the streets to blame (streets)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Don't blame it on me, blame it on the streets (let's get it)

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Blame it on the streets, blame it on me (street)
I can get 'em to your door without a shipping fee (street)
Michael Jordan, I got gas bags for twenty-three (yeah)
I'm throwin' off, it ain't 'bout money, it ain't important to me (jug)
Every time somebody get robbed they blame it on street (street)
Money hungry, I ain't goin' back on E (nah)

Blue hunneds, old hunneds, I got real money (count up)
Dope money, weed money, I got street money (count up)

Do my math on all my jewelry, I spent a mill on it (yeah)

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
See we get so much money, it's a damn shame
Real street nigga, nigga don't give a fuck 'bout fame (fuck)
And how I'm feelin', fuck, I might go cop a China dame (China dame)
And I was raised in the streets so the streets to blame (streets)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Blame it on the streets, blame it on the streets (not me)
Don't blame it on me, blame it on the streets (let's get it)
