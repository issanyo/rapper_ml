Whip Whip Whip

Water whippin on the track
Water whippin for the pack
Water whipping in the trap
Water whippin for a pack

I got niggas and they water whippin
8 ball to a quarter flippin
Got the pirex standing in kitchen
Tryna get a rich porter ticket
I send them thangs up the Missippi
It's official then it's coming back
Serving raw uncut
Fuck around and have a heart attack
I'm calling plays like the quarterback
Make them things ratta tat tat
You ain't really sold drugs
Youngblood now I want to run a frontal pack
I make it bounce like a jumping jack
That ain't real nigga what is that?
I had to switch up the mojo
Imma kick it like a dojo

Water whippin on the track
Water whippin in the trap
Water whippin for the pack
Water whippin for the bag
Northside they be water whippin
Southside they be water whippin
Eastside they be water whippin
Westside they be water whippin

Big bails of the gas
You could smell it through the bag
Trash bags of the white girl
Turn the city into the white world
He the plug on the Xans
Whole thangs of the percocets
And if you spending about a bag
He gone show you what he working with

Water whip
Water whip
Like Gunna got drip
Fifty thousand dollar watch on my wrist
All that rap about bricks
Running through the six with them all
Everyday nigga we ball
All I make is one phone call
My niggas come knock down walls
In my kitchen water whipping dry whip bricks
In my click ain't nuttin but real niggas and convicts
I fall off I start selling niggas dummy bricks
Juug king cuz I mastermind that street shit

Water whippin on the track
Water whippin in the trap
Water whippin for the pack
Water whippin for the bag
Northside they be water whippin
Southside they be water whippin
Eastside they be water whippin
Westside they be water whippin

All my niggas trapping like a foo
Selling straight white, that peru
They animal, they come fresh out the zoo
I swear I miss d money he gone shoot
You come with beef we eat it like some food
Don't step on work cuz we ain't got no shoes
My young boys fucked around and made the news
They repossed their houses and their coups

Water whippin on the track
Water whippin in the trap
Water whippin for the pack
Water whippin for the bag
Northside they be water whippin
Southside they be water whippin
Eastside they be water whippin
Westside they be water whippin

Big bails of the gas
You could smell it through the bag
Trash bags of the white girl
Turn the city into the white world
He the plug of the Xans
Whole thangs of the percocets
And if you spending about a bag
He gone show you what he working with
