[Intro]
I don't give a fuck, twist your fingers up
Load the clip up, jump in your whip and stunt
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Like Casino, do what the fuck I want

[Chorus]
Middle fingers in the air if you don't give a fuck
You see a hater, throw a chair if you don't give a fuck
I burn millions every year I just don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Selling fake dope and weed, disrespecting customers
Young Scooter on some rap shit (I straight don't give a fuck)
You know my niggas by action and [?] niggas up
I just don't give a fuck, I just don't give a fuck
Like 2Pac, hit em' up
They tried to hit me in
I play it high cool
I know my plug for sure
I [?] a ticket down the street from the red stone

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We in this dirty world
How can I explain?
It's a shiesty sheisty
So I stay in my lane
Don't want nobody fame
It ain't no famous
These niggas not 100
I still roll run em'
I just don't give a fuck, black Migo game we stay countin' up
(Rest in peace to Pimp C and DJ Screw we stay poured up)
I kept working and working until a ran a million
Yeah rapping and still serving, I just don't give a fuck

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Like 2Pac, hit em' up
I just don't give a fuck
I spent a million last month, I just don't give a fuck
I just don't give a fuck
We missed a truckload of bricks, I don't give a fuck
Wake up, had a hundred racks up
I turn my own self up
Free Gua he got caught and likely he don't give a fuck
