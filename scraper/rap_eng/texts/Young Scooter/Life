[Intro]
Uncle Will, yeah he saved my life
Black Migo Gang nigga, true story

[Chorus]
Life, can't be playin' with your life
Niggas snitchin', stealin' from they people, shit ain't right
Life, leave your wife, that bitch ain't right
These hoes ain't loyal, that's a part of life
Life, hustle, grind, and stack it every night
I do this shit for my kids, they my fuckin' life
Life, thank god I'm still livin' life
I did a lot of shit wrong but I still paid the price

[Verse 1]
I know my OG Double watchin' over me
I'm from apartments but they play my music overseas
In Toronto, Jamaica, Africa, and Belize
I done seen so much shit you probably wouldn't believe
I done seen niggas get whacked
Four five six, that's a head-cracker, head shot, a dead dead
Yeah these dirty streets will take your life
I seen a nigga get Slaughter Gang in the back with a knife
Life, I blow twenty racks a night
White, cocaine that's my fuckin' life
Flights, private jets when we take flight
Thank Uncle Will for what he did, that nigga saved my life

[Chorus]
Life, can't be playin' with your life
Niggas snitchin', stealin' from they people, shit ain't right
Life, leave your wife, that bitch ain't right
These hoes ain't loyal, that's a part of life
Life, hustle, grind, and stack it every night
I do this shit for my kids, they my fuckin' life
Life, thank god I'm still livin' life
I did a lot of shit wrong but I still paid the price

[Verse 2]
I know niggas doin' life 'cause they ain't had no lawyer
Nigga lost his whole bag and he couldn't afford it
So the judge took his life like life ain't important
Nigga you shouldn't trust your wife, I seen that ho with Jordan
There's nothing important in life
You only get one chance at life
Listen to my music, you'll change your life
I just made like eighty thousand last night
I hope everybody doin' life get that appeal
But keep it real, don't you snitch and work a deal
And if you real I know you feel the way I feel
This a dirty world that we fuckin' livin' in

[Chorus]
Life, can't be playin' with your life
Niggas snitchin', stealin' from they people, shit ain't right
Life, leave your wife, that bitch ain't right
These hoes ain't loyal, that's a part of life
Life, hustle, grind, and stack it every night
I do this shit for my kids, they my fuckin' life
Life, thank god I'm still livin' life
I did a lot of shit wrong but I still paid the price
