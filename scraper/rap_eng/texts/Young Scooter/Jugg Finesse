Hah
It's Guwop
Got free bricks... two
Free bricks

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I turned something to nothing, in the Cutlass I'm buttless
Don't give a fuck if you pretty
Don't fuck with me 'less you fucking
If you ain't sucking I'm bucking, bitch I'm so cocky, I'm popping
We'll go club-hoppin' in London, and if you fine, take you shopping
And I got so much money, I swear my pockets is sloppy
I'm rockin' foreign designers, where everything is so cocky
My money winning, you jocking, all my hoes spoiled rotten
I bought a Bentley a masterpiece, so the jack-boys glockin
Red beam on yo' head, now you're homeboy shot
I got a gun and an extender for every chain I got
And if the bank was to give a nickel for all the brain I got
I'd be a multi-billionaire, I'd have to explain this guap, it's Guwop

[Hook]
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
I rap 'bout schemes press down on jacks
I work that triple beam, I'm the man in the trap
I'll show you shit you never seen, you get rich off that
I'm talking million-dollar months, you could double yo' sack
Smoke $200 blunts, every box that's a stack
Mix it wit' the caviar, while I cook up the crack
365 I gotta juug, paper-chasin' the sack
I got all these free bands, don't give a fuck about rap
All we do is juug, me and Gucci gettin' it in
1017, that's a brick wit' a extra 10
You buy a brick from me a 36 you get a 10
You shouldn't've shopped wit' Scooter, he done did that shit again

[Hook]
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
Juug finesse, I'm gone with the sack
Ain't no need callin' fo' yo' money back
