[Intro]
Haha
Yung Lan on the track
Trauma Tone
Jugg king

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Real street nigga, ain't no flaws in me (Ain't no flaws in me)
Half a ticket on and I ain't brought it all with me (Count up)
If you my nigga, I keep it real, I let you ball with me (I let you ball with me)
They caught us with it, I took the charge, ain't let you fall with me (The charge)
And I ain't gon let you walk with me if you ain't crawl with me (If you ain't jugg with me)
Ten chains on but I ain't brought it all with me (Eliantte)
Bale thunderstorm, pounds dropping by the fifties (Droppin' by the fifties)
First foreign I ever had was a 650 (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Me and 550 had pounds for four-fifty (Four-fifty)
My partner Ty gave me half on a 650 (Skrrt skrrt)
Fuck the feds, free Trident and OG Ricky (Fuck 'em)
I'm part of the Mob just like Gotti, get the strap, 50 (Brrat)
And I ain't leavin' out the house without the sack with me (Racks)
At sixteen I was in school and I had crack with me (Cocaina)
Every day we breakin' in houses, me and Mob petty (Finesse)
Stayed down, got a thirty-six, call it Jerome Bettis (Yeah)
Fucked the money up and told Side bring a fifty (Count up)
A hundred a piece from slime and Future, that's a quarter milli' (Count up)
In six months I made two M's, stretchin' work like a gym (Jugg)
I love my niggas just like brothers, so thank God for them (Street)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Real street nigga, ain't no flaws in me (Ain't no flaws in me)
Half a ticket on and I ain't brought it all with me (Count up)
If you my nigga, I keep it real, I let you ball with me (I let you ball with me)
They caught us with it, I took the charge, ain't let you fall with me (The charge)
And I ain't gon let you walk with me if you ain't crawl with me (If you ain't jugg with me)
Ten chains on but I ain't brought it all with me (Eliantte)
Bale thunderstorm, pounds dropping by the fifties (Droppin' by the fifties)
First foreign I ever had was a 650 (Skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Bought that 9 milli' from Q BayBay, cost me six-fifty
Used to punch on niggas with Scooby and JJ
Foe caught a body, I was sendin' him JPay
I ain't wanna die, was only in sixth grade
We was gettin' shot at, I'm callin' ShayShay
I know last week sent my mama a dub
Then walked in Barney's and spent like 8K
I was like 15, up in the club
Glock under my belt, had that bitch on hug
When I got shot, tell the police none'
My mama knew she raisin' a thug
Walk in that bitch, three empty guns
She just gon' sweep that under the rug
'Member I ran through that sixty and ain't had none'
Took some lil' pints, told 'em get it in blood
Now I'm spendin' a whole bunch of hundreds
Ayy Lil Pint, what you sippin', lil' blood?
What I'm is? With Bloods
What I'm is? And 150 thugs
That's how we went on the run
We'd get bored, shoot niggas for fun
We try and practice some' (Bah)
Oh, he thought he wasn't no factor, huh?

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
Real street nigga, ain't no flaws in me (Ain't no flaws in me)
Half a ticket on and I ain't brought it all with me (Count up)
If you my nigga, I keep it real, I let you ball with me (I let you ball with me)
They caught us with it, I took the charge, ain't let you fall with me (The charge)
And I ain't gon let you walk with me if you ain't crawl with me (If you ain't jugg with me)
Ten chains on but I ain't brought it all with me (Eliantte)
Bale thunderstorm, pounds dropping by the fifties (Droppin' by the fifties)
First foreign I ever had was a 650 (Skrrt, skrrt)
