Black Amigo Gang, that's the clique I claim
Pay attention nigga while I chase my dream
Like Meek Milly all Philly nigga I sip lean
Exclusive outfit nigga I stay clean

I'm a young nigga, count it up
OG, count it up
Bad bitches, count it up
Real nigga, count it up
Black Amigo Gang, that's the clique I claim
And I don't see no other rappers I'm in my own lane

[Verse 1]
Black amigo gang, lil mexico the set
Cold rolex 50 thousand dollar bets
Chasing them blue M&M's
I salute to PeeWee dem
Money power ammunution, Scooter got a 3 of em
Bricks in duffle dirts
Got duffle plugs in Baltimore
My nigga shoot out the corner store
So don't go past the red store
Scooter rock the red, white and blue flag, but I don't gangbang though
You know they [?] fuck around and get smoked
I ain't crippin' but my partners do
I ain't players but my niggas who
Keep it real ya I fuck with you
You a runner I ain't through with you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If theres a bad bitch in Atlanta I done fucked them
If a nigga open in Atlanta I [?]
She take out the autotunes off, these rappers ain't nothing
Before these rappers [?] I was in Cali jugging
Along as he was with me smoking ride through the 6
Flying packs through the hood, taking chances with [?]
One pointed at my head, [?]
My whole hood was ready before I heard a bitch boy
I just took a [?] he want a V12
Lil Mexico city, cocaina for sale
Every state I do a show, they tell me I'm too real
I bought 20 [?] this rap fake as hell
