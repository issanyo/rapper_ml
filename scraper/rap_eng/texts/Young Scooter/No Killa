[Intro: Young Scooter & Guap Tarantino]
Yeah, haha, BMFBG
Yeah, haha
Oh yeah, oh, you shot him on sight?
Big drums, nigga
Say they sell drugs, sell drugs nigga
Say he sell drugs, sell drugs
Say you sell drugs, sell drugs

[Chorus: Young Scooter & Guap Tarantino]
Nigga, you ain't no killer, nigga, you ain't no killer
You just hang around the robbers and the drug dealers
Used to run the block with them thug niggas
One word'll get you popped, you a dub, nigga
I get ice, an ice attack, fuck your bitch then give her back
In the streets, we handle that, young FreeBandz Gang is Taliban
I fuck your bitch then hit her friend, these niggas really copycats
One call will get you whacked, young nigga havin' rack-rack-racks

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I don't really rap, I sleep in the trap
We got pounds, I don't sell no sacks
Lil' broke ass nigga, I buy your trap
You ain't no shooter, you sold your strap
Gelato, smoke a lot of that
Protect my ice with fifty straps
This AP cost me sixty racks
Just lost fifty grams and whipped it back
Aston Martin with the rose gold rims
We all brothers, I ain't got no friends
All my work jump out the gym
Bales go out and bricks come in
Triple salute the gang I'm in
I'm a FreeBand nigga, I play to win
Worldwide superstar, I'm Black Amigo hustlin'

[Chorus: Young Scooter & Guap Tarantino]
Nigga, you ain't no killer, nigga, you ain't no killer
You just hang around the robbers and the drug dealers
Used to run the block with them thug niggas
One word'll get you popped, you a dub, nigga
I get ice, an ice attack, fuck your bitch then give her back
In the streets, we handle that, young FreeBandz Gang is Taliban
I fuck your bitch then hit her friend, these niggas really copycats
One call will get you whacked, young nigga havin' rack-rack-racks

[Verse 2: Guap Tarantino]
1'5, you know big Guap, I bring the birds in
Boy, I heard you wasn't really servin'
Big Guap in this bitch, I got them racks and went Tourettes
If the feds watchin', bitch, I'm still ridin' with that TEC
Spent some racks on meds
Fuck your bitch and then go to the neck
Hundreds on the bed
I just made ten thousand through a text
I heard that I was next
Niggas doubtin' me, I told 'em bet
Real OG, I don't owe debts
These niggas cap, you know the rest

[Chorus: Young Scooter & Guap Tarantino]
Nigga, you ain't no killer, nigga, you ain't no killer
You just hang around the robbers and the drug dealers
Used to run the block with them thug niggas
One word'll get you popped, you a dub, nigga
I get ice, an ice attack, fuck your bitch then give her back
In the streets, we handle that, young FreeBandz Gang is Taliban
I fuck your bitch then hit her friend, these niggas really copycats
One call will get you whacked, young nigga havin' rack-rack-racks
