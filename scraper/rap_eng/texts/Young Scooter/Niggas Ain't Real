These niggas ain’t real no more
These niggas ain’t real no more
They try to divide and conquer
I know how that goes
These niggas ain’t real no more
These niggas ain’t real no more
(These niggas ain’t real no more)
When they got the upper hand
They try to play you low
These niggas ain’t real no more
These niggas ain’t real no more

These niggas ain’t real no more
These niggas ain’t real no more

[Verse 1]
That’s how I feel, yeah that’s how I feel (that’s how I feel)
These niggas ain’t real oh no these niggas ain’t real (these niggas ain’t real)
I ain’t got no deal oh no I ain’t got no deal (ain’t got no deal nigga)
Went out the radio, I’m winning still ([?])
They turn the state, these niggas turn the state (pussy niggas)
A statement took that boy away (boy away)
The games they play, this shit go either way (either way)
You get locked up, yeah they throw the key away
Niggas say ‘real’ that don’t mean shit
I seen real niggas roll statements
Pussy nigga he told on me his bitch, she ain’t even say shit
That’s the definition of a real bitch
Got down with bricks, got real bricks (real bricks)
That Migo gang was on six
A hood full of bosses

Yeah he got him, and I see it coming
Would never fall out bout this rap money
Split the hundred thousand in jewelry with my trap money (real time)
Nigga keep it real, don’t come short with that pack money (real nigga)
If a nigga selling he’ll turn right around and tell on you
Nigga say he’ll boss but the pussy nigga ain’t even got bail money (say what?)
Ain’t got no loyalty, no love at all (at all)
Free all my real niggas behind the wall ( free all my real niggas)
That’s how I feel, yeah that’s how I feel (Scooter!)
These hoes ain’t real, you know these hoes ain’t real (shit)
I got deals, cocaine deals (cocaine deals)
Real talk, seen a mil for this rap shit (caught up, caught up)
