[Chorus:]
Gave Yo’ a whole ten and he didn’t deserve it
Gave Emmett 15 and it really hurt me
Gave Trevor [?] and I’m still working
Gave me the life sentence and we still serving
Streets man they really dirty
These streets man they really dirty
These cops man they playin’ it dirty
These snitches out here playin’ it dirty

[Verse 1:]
They gave my brother a dime
And I was right there
In the Fed Building
Felt like he got the chair
He called me from the cab on that same day
I did the 4th double J couldn't find the [?]
Two hundred in the suitcase
Blow fast
For everybody an they lawyer so they can try to wax
Whole fam charged up
Even got my daddy
And my step momma too
They all jolt with trafficking
It hurt me to my heart boy
I swear to God
That nigga gave me anything I wanted boy
Had bro in the same place Meechi at
Yay’ brother died but best believe he cut em fast

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Worse charge that ever caught me an’ Lil’ Josh
Tryna keep it real
Charger got the plug and ran off
But that’s ma nigga still
And he a black amigo boss
Right hand snitchin
Nowadays you get triple crossed
They gave Five 55
Nigga ran off in his house
Yo’ got a 10
I sat down and started to think about
Same case I caught with Lil’ Joshy
Helped me burn out
I wish I could help him now
But he can’t find out
He says our childhood friend told him
Know him when he had no clothes
You put some clothes on him
So I put a darker tint on the Range Rover
If you ain’t working with a brick tho
Game over

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My [?] nigga prayin on em
They fake as hell
Ya’ll might fit a ransom
I get called
I’m making bail
[?] gotta wrote down, went on appeal
Traffickin in Mexico
That shit get real
No Pepsi Coke
Ain’t no lead shots
Emmett at the top
Shootin nuttin but head shots
Standin on the block
Hundred [?] dialin’
That same block
I used to be nickle’ n dimin’
Ain’t no rewind
Betta play yo hand right
They ain’t shit free out here
Betta get yo cheque right
Watch who you serve
We got Fed tight
Do your research nigga
Been silent all my life

[Chorus]

[Instrumental track plays to end]
