[Intro]
Yeah
You already know this that
Yung Lan on the track
Motherfuckin' count music
I ain't gon' keep tellin' niggas
You hear me, get your calculator

[Verse]
Count music, nigga, get your forks, boy
Get your stainless steel pot and a brick, boy
It's time to go back to the basics, niggas snitchin', boy
If you a hustler, cook your own dope in that kitchen, boy
I bounced back like cooked crack, got these rapers jealous
These niggas get the big head like they forgot who helped 'em
Dirty money, legal money, don't put it together
Bird call, yeah, them birds fly in any weather
Rest in peace to Lo, king of Bankhead
I'm the Jugg King, I got real bread
Seventeen-five, bitch I still got 'em
I remixed 'em half-and-half and I ain't even dry 'em
I got chickens, I got chickens, every day I fry 'em
All the fuck niggas livin', real niggas dyin'
Trump crazy, he just passed a law for dick-ridin'
Human calculator, Scooter always multiplyin'
I know so much about the street, nigga
I know like fifty ways to eat, nigga
I'll get you whacked, I ain't gon' beef with you
Fifty to a hundred bands a week, nigga
Count up
