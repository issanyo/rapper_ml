[Hook]
I ain't crippin' but my partners do
Shout out to Dre he going out to true
Red white and blue that's what we do
Shout out to Flocka can't forget piru
Six money murder yea that's [?] crew
GDs and BD, MS13 too
I don't bang but my partners do
You disrespect my name they'll run and shoot


[Verse 1]
I was born in it, you was sworn in it
Since day 1 I've been committing
Taking shots at a nigga fitting
An OG who still handles business
So let me catch a nigga slipping
Red lights nigga trippy
But we really set trippin
Me and Flocka flame just dippin

[Verse 2]
Sit 100 Benz, hot set of rims
Pulled up on some twins
Got some footage for my friends
Niggas in the pen, wait to see them again

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You'll be missing if I point at you
In the kitchen turn the 9 to 2
I pay homage to my OGs like Rich the Truth
They gave me game nigga that I could never show to you
My Scooter walk around with all that money on him
I had his jury with this cash half a million on him
I don't gang bang the police think I do
And I ain't gotta bitch sleep with the robin crew

[Verse 4]
I'm all about my money count checks
Everybody know that about Scooter
I was born with respect no flex
Yea that's why I made truth called music

[Hook]
