[Verse 1: Spree Wilson]
Welcome to the new game Apprentice
A landscape of bumps we jumpin' like fences
You too can throw your shit up on the YouTube
Until [?] go on and block it like Prince did
A misfit of bandits, plan it
On the planet I put it on like the bandit
Shit I kick harder than spaceship damage
New Jack is back and Swingin' like a hammock
So why would I never take advantage?
Every second I turn a minute to utilize flow
Put it all together with a little bad weather
And I bet you my style you find as quick as Nemo
Let's see
From the beat poets, to the everyday folk my shit is common as the lowest
Denominator, rap style innovator
Keepin' the torch lit until I need a generator

[Hook] [Novel]:
We gon' get there, we gon' stroll to a place where we belong
To another, 'nother land
To another, 'nother land
Where we stoppin', I don't know
Where ever it is we gon' go
To the mother, motherland
To the mother, motherland
Uh ho

[Verse Two] [Novel]:
And I'm here to say he on the mothership
Uh, uh, uh, uh I'm on some other shit
Give me a snare and a bass line
Rap is like a democratic party I take mines
Get it?
We gon' thump when we win it
Till we ball till we fall till somebody's invented
Paul's sittin' in a straight jacket gettin' it fitted
So I'm diggin' into this hip hop, a city committee
Uh, cause I got hot spit, I got fire
What I got will make a nigga retire
In his entire full empire
Oh yeah baby like Austin Pires
I meant Powers
Oh that's sour
You so tasteless, I'm seasoned like Lawrys
All these cowards fall over like towers
Another MC another nigga of the hour, deflowered

[Hook] [Novel]:
We gon' get there, we gon' stroll to a place where we belong
To another, 'nother land
To another, 'nother land
Where we stoppin', I don't know
Where ever it is we gon' go
To the mother, motherland
To the mother, motherland
Uh ho

[Verse Three] [Joell Ortiz]:
Check it out, close your eyes
Life in my motherland
Peace sign in my left, mic in my other hand
Righteous mind states, nice to your brother man
Beautiful sized plates, no more feeling hunger fam
No more a need to put your money in a rubber band
You ain't gotta hustle ain't no gutter damn
I swear I can see it, it's nice
I'm covered in gold and my queen is in ice
My friends reachin' for price
We getting married barefoot on the beach and it's white
Let the good times roll like casinos and dice
All my homies locked down ain't in affairs no mo'
All my people underground ain't dead no mo'
They all alive and well
They all lightin' L's
They all sippin' alcohol in a fly hotel
At my reception, like, "We love your wife Joell."
My mother land the flip side like a life in hell

[Hook] [Novel]:
We gon' get there, we gon' stroll to a place where we belong
To another, 'nother land
To another, 'nother land
Where we stoppin', I don't know
Where ever it is we gon' go
To the mother, motherland
To the mother, motherland
Uh ho
