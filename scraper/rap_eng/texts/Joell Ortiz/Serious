[Chorus: Joell Ortiz &  Joe Budden]
You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz &  Joe Budden]
Man, y'all done gone and did it, well come on with it
The fifth got a kick, but won't slip, I rubber gripped it
Wrap you in them sheets on Christmas, I'm double-gifted
Double barrel shotty, you double jointed when you flippin'
Ask about your boy, they'll tell you I'm not the fella
Tomato sauce whoever tryna shred up my mozzarella
I guess it's in my genes, no prints if I got the poke out
Man, let these nigga's reach, I'm Iverson with the blow out
Sometimes you gotta show out, just to show 'em what Joe 'bout
Give 'em the green light, well fuck it, where we even goin' now?
Got shooters on the scanner, you never know what we spoke 'bout
Picture Tony Montana with hammers runnin' in Sos' house
Ghost Town
Bullets in the beach chair, lines drawn, break the sand
Got bad news, sit 'em down, nah, nigga take a stand
Dirty crackheads run up on you, "What you was sayin', man?"
It's lights out, won't even take a bath, ha

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz &  Joe Budden]
You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho

[Interlude]
You dick-faced ass nigga's asked for it so, here they come

[Verse 2: Joe Budden &  Joell Ortiz]
No matter where they from I disappeared and dump
No choice but to swear they dumb, but we're not dumb
I'm on my Luke Skywalker, get your Jedi spun
I'm on my DMC, I hear them things rev, y'all run
Guess it's begun, get the private jet, pilot set
Alibi in check, to the island head, make sure it's no survivors left
'Round up all the hostages, bum stiggity bum, stiggity bum
Hey, I mean a lot of them, shit be soundin' like Das EFX
I pay no mind to the talkin' 'til it's a heightened threat
Never baby nigga's with envy to give me my respect
I eject bullets from rifles wearin' a sniper vest
Find your body OTC, you're like a Prilosec
Y'all won't even hear me comin', Michael Myers' steps
Hear that thing ch-ch-choppin' 'til no tires left
Bulldogs bark, 4s roars like a lion's breath
I love new toys, so I invest

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz &  Joe Budden]
You niggas want war? Trust me you don't want war
Homeboy, you don't know how serious it could be
Man, the feeling starts, it's a million man march
No games, all my soldiers as serious as can be be
When we pull up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
Then we run up like, hey ya, hey ya, hey ya, ho
