[Verse 1: Steele]
When Smif N Wessun preforms it's guns out
Not Daryl Simmons but D Ace I runs house
Smack earth, wind and fire out niggas who run mouth
Streets cold like the winter, birds gone fly south
Put your kids in a corner like time out
Look nigga, I don't give two fucks what you rhyme 'bout
All your boring war stories, your shorty's, your lyin' 'bout
Get you all up in the hallway your body is lying now

[Verse 2: Tek]
Nigga, we dough getters
Ho' hitters, you got to feel us
Cocksuckers
You know why? We gorillas
Spot rushers, head busters
The flow so vicious, you motherfuckers made you can't touch us
Gun holster on my shoulder
Money folder, bank stopper
Brand dropper, six thrower
Louie rocker, bottle of clicq' popper
And for the green card I get your ass laced proper

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
See me, I ain't got ta'
Introduce myself I'm the bank stopper
Win the dice game proper
7-1-8 Partna'
The zip code, where the fifth flows, a clip load
At your kinfolk, get dough, no info
For the price though, we gutter we don't talk
Leave it on the streets like skellyboards and old chalk
These things on our waist somehow give us a cold heart
The closest thing to a Benz in my hood was a go-kart

[Hook: Rock]
We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
Nope

[Verse 4: Steele]
The hammer come with a coola'
That might slam into your medulla
It's bug what I do for the love of Karim the ruler
Showed me maneuvers I use the Ruger to shoot ya
For snoozing I leave you losers behind a pool of manure
Do ya just like Medusa, body stiff not moving ya
Your mommy sitting boo hooin'
Your boo is screwin' a new friend
You and your crew gonna need more than a deuce deuce to move in
Got guns like Bruce Bruce on heavy metal music

[Verse 5: Tek]
You're kinda young so just let me learn you
That I keep a 40. underneath the thermal
And a leather pair of stowaway gloves
So it's, no prints, no bodies, no judge
And that means no case no charges
You an atheist if you don't fuck with the god
And I turn stacks, thousands from pennies
Coppin' PRP jeans right from [?]

[Verse 6: Joell Ortiz]
And I cop bottles of E&J from right from Richie
Liquor store, get a whore then go pipe her silly
In a room for like 50 dollars
No we not doing dinner at no Benihana's
I just ordered chicken, holla
Ma I'm so gutter, no sister, no brother
One mother, no father, no problem, oh brother
Y'all gonna jump me again? Let's do it bitch
Cuz like the only thing running is my nose when I'm sick


[Hook: Rock]
We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
We're gonna stomp through
Any hood we feel like stomping through
Dump, on anyone of you
Just say you want it who?
We from the swamps
Tryna get up and get out and get that money, true
But we ain't who you wanna run into
Nope
