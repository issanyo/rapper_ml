[Hook]
He's easing in the city
He's dangerous, sly and shifty
If he should happen to write your name down
Don't you try to fly outta town
You see he's slick
And he can't be tricked
He ain't never made a mark
He could not hit!

[Verse 1]
He wore a mean pair of gators
Always chewing now and laters
All flavors
Womanizing cause his talk game major
Wore gold like the Lakers always kept a slew of haters
Cause his paper long like his hair draping over his blazer
His name was Vinnie Vega
I thought he owed the bodega
I later learned he was the number runner and local player
Oral like the mayor
Gave money to all the kids
Wouldn't come as a surprise if you told me they all was his
He played them dominoes, I mean rarely would papi lose
He was standing slam the feature while screaming out capicu!
I was too young to drink he would go in and and got me brews
Every now and then when he had the time he would drop me jewels
Took me under his wing you could say that he got me smooth
Impressive with the ladies he taught me to not be rude
School me that, there's a thin line between cocky dudes and a jerk
I tell his story with a smirk

[Hook]
He's easing in the city

Don't you try to fly outta town

And he can't be tricked

He could not hit!

[Verse 2]
Now remember I told you that Vinnies paper was sort of long
Well some kuckleheads in my hood been scheming like all along
Disrespectful dudes pulled an auto out on his moms
Kidnapped her making demands kept calling him on his horn
Never do that to Vinnie
Okay, you all been warned
Must admit that they had balls, but here's where it all went wrong
Vinnie threw out a number for anyone with a clue
Sure enough he got a ring from a clown that these niggas knew
They met up in the park, he tossed him all of they names
Told him mommy whereabouts and how this was all insane
When he was done talking he asked him to pass his guap
A man of his word Vinnie just handed that man a knock
Vinnie asked for it back, here was what Vinnie said
"For knowing and not telling you paying to not be dead"
Shorty gave back the dough, and Vinnie just scratched his head
Told him "get out my face 'for I fill yo ass up with lead"

He's easing in the city

[Verse 3]
So Vinnie paid a visit to all of these niggas cribs
Told they family what must be done for any of them to live
They must of got the word cause they kept ringing his jack
Saying stupid shit like "nah we gon die if we bring her back"
He gave them all his word like "I ain't gon kill you guys
Y'all young and dumb and lucky my mother is still alive
It's 3 o clock now by 3:10 she better be home
If she walk in 3:11 y'all getting lead in ya dome"
Sure enough they returned and now everything going smooth
But see Vinnie from the hood and I'm sure that y'all know the rules
This happened in the winter by spring they had made the news
I know they ain't think that this shit was over man they was fools
But Vinnie ain't do it, they died in each of they cribs
All of em in they sleep, what a coincidence this is
But remember Vinnie told they family what had to be done to live
Well here's what he said on Mother's Day you poison them kids

[Hook]
He's easing in the city
