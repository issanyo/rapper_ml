[Intro] [Joell Ortiz talking]:
Awww man. Y'all already know what this is. It's that recession music right here. Niggas doin' what they gotta do to get that money

[Verse One]:
I'm in here six in the mornin' finna lift a box
They want them stacked up neatly but I just pick a spot
I don't know how much patience they think a nigga got
This job make me sick, I'm gettin' that itch like chicken pox
I wanna quit and I would if I didn't need the check
I'm just quiet, doin' my job tryin' to be the best
I mind my business, bother no one, never be a pest
It's like my boss don't never be comin' at me correct
But I'm a man, I swallow that and tell him, "holla back
Yeah you right, I'm always wrong." Just let my dollars stack
I almost got enough money to leave my momma's shack
I already got my eyes on this hooptie that I'mma mack
But awe man, there's this pain that's inside back
I be standin' there, outta nowhere I feel like I'll collapse
I really think that I'mma quit today
But I'm a fighter, if I get fired I'll still get paid
I'm bout my money

[Hook]:
I don't know what y'all heard 'bout me
But when I'm sweatin' don't wanna hear the boss man scream or I'm jettin'
? I got mouths to feed
Bills in the mailbox I ain't about to leave
I'm 'bout my money
Cause still don't nothin' move but that
I'm 'bout my money
Cause I know what to do with that
I'm 'bout my money
See y'all dudes ain't used to that
I'm 'bout my money
Let me show you what I do for that

[Verse Two]:
I'm out here lookin' for somethin' on my fuckin' bike
Funny this ten speed somethin' I caught the other night
Who left the window open? Is that a laptop?
These hustler niggas be havin' the weakest stash box
Know I keep a spark plug ridin' by the park thugs
A ski mask on stand by for the dark mugs
Who got a dice game poppin' with a couple stacks
Nobody move, if I hit you, you not comin' back
Sometimes I get greesey, for real I might snatch your jack
And get it off for the haze man for a bag of that
Don't let me see your old lady with the cataracts
Give up the purse granny or you'll become an acrobat
You'll be tumblin' and rollin' for them crumbs you holdin'
And you too old to walk up in Bingo with somethin' swollen
Y'all can say I'm a petty crook but hey
I do this right, might catch me a little jook today

[Hook]:
I don't know what y'all heard 'bout me
But when I'm robbin'
Can't earn a dime round me
Man I'm starvin'
Who dares wear they jewels by me?
Count they money at the bar, they a fool like me
I'm 'bout my money
Cause still don't nothin' move but that
I'm 'bout my money
Cause I know what to do with that
I'm 'bout my money
See y'all dudes ain't used to that
I'm 'bout my money
Let me show you what I do for that

[Verse Three]:
I'm one of them dudes out there before the store opens
Crust in my eye, a fresh bundle of raw hopin'
A nice rush will be plus for my next flip
It's easy to get in but so hard to exit
So my fate I accept it, man I'm a block boy
I'm into chips, new whips and a few hot toys
Things that make a lot noise when drama around
Fuckin' the girls I couldn't cause they hollerin' now
They know I'm 'bout my money
Man, my cash never salt and spoil
Man, I think it's my grandmother's fault
I want the finer things so I'm on a grind mission
Nah, you can't pump that over here, that's mine, pimpin'
And I'm willin' to spaz, drug dealin' is bad
So it ain't all good till I finish this bag
I got a whole lot of bills to pay
I do this right, I'll be layin' up with crills today
I'm 'bout my money

[Hook]:
I don't know what ya heard 'bout me
But when I'm pumpin'
Can't move an herb 'round me
Yo we thumpin'
Who got the same stamp as me?
Let me find out in the air where your hands will be
I'm 'bout my money
Cause still don't nothin' move but that
I'm 'bout my money
Cause I know what to do with that
I'm 'bout my money
See y'all dudes ain't used to that
I'm 'bout my money
Let me show you what I do for that
