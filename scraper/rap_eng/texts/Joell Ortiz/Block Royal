[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Hey yo Carl Blaze, tell Screw we did it
BR

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
If you never ran, never will
Sit up in the can, wait it out, never squeal
Then you Block Royal
See that the team is fed
When it gotta go down, you aim beam at his head
Then you Block Royal
It ain't easy being a rider
But I guess sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta
We're not guaranteed a tomorrow
But when you're royalty on the block, you're dying with honor

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Who practically own your jeans
Play up in X-Bar and deep with Prostyle and Camillo, we rep hard
Screw army, BR, BR, BR
Don't tool on me
We are, we are, we are
More than a million strong, who want what
Hey Carl Blaze just passed, we tight already, you could get stomped up
I'm usually calm but, I took too many losses last year
I swear I'm finna call Akon up
My Senegal Africans get to clappin' for niggas, yeah
Sit 'em in your anthem, get it crackin' and disappear
We ain't a clique, we ain't a gang, we a family
We're in New York, we're in LA, we're in Miami
We definitely in New Jerz where plenty murders occur
So just splurge when a nigga says: "Yo, that's my word"
Free Flav, Cessa, free Jo Lo
Free Umph, Mike My, free Joe Joe

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
If you never ran, never will
Sit up in the can, wait it out, never squeal
Then you Block Royal
See that the team is fed
When it gotta go down, you aim beam at his head
Then you Block Royal
It ain't easy being a rider
But I guess sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta, gotta
We're not guaranteed a tomorrow
But when you're royalty on the block, you're dying with honor
Block Royal

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Who VIP up in Exit with the bottle sloppy
Ain't let us up in Lotus, so we tore down Roxy's
On the side of the booth with Enough
See I'm buggin, I'm drunk
The shorty ugly, but her booty is tough
And I stays after ass, I have to have something with a bounce
Like a track from Dre at Aftermath
Somebody said: "Let's slide to Ringside"
It's popping a 2-Tone
Inside with that wakatezee they watch out
Clockin' the way we move
Rockin' the crazy jewels
But God forbid they should plot
We'll be poppin with eighty-two's
They don't call him AK for nothing
What you're thinking 'bout?
He'll lay something down in New York and take the Lincoln out
All the way down to Sweets, get a shape up and eat
Call Big Joe walk right in, y'all been on line for weeks
Dennis line the freaks, so that VI's packed
So I'm probably lying when I tell you that I'll be right back

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
If you never ran, never will
Sit up in the can, wait it out, never squeal
Then you Block Royal
See that the team is fed
When it gotta go down, you aim beam at his head
Then you Block Royal
It ain't easy being a rider
But I guess sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta, gotta
We're not guaranteed a tomorrow
But when you're royalty on the block, you're dying with honor
Royal

[Outro: 2-Tone (Joell Ortiz)]
Yo Joeezy, I told you (I know)
Screw saw it (That's right!)
Carl Blaze repped it (Uh-huh!)
You already know how 2-Tone feel about it (C'mon!)
Now everybody gonna feel it (Uh-huh!)
Heavy Hitters got us (Let's go!)
All Pro got us (Uh-huh!)
We run around owning tha clubs with Hitless
New Life is fammo (Big Joe)
We don't even know what a club line looks like (Ha-ha)
When you Block Royal you walk right in (That's right!)
How many people?
What you mean how many people?
2-Tone plus seventy-three (Ha-ha!)
Yaowa! (Yaowa!)
