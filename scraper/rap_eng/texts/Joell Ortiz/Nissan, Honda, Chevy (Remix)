[Hook]
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, my stash is never empty baby
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, Nissan, Honda, Chevy
Nissan, Honda, Chevy, the D's will never get me

[Verse 1 - Joell]
In my hoopty I be swerving, the public's who I'm serving
Boost phone forever chirping, I be out there putting work in
Know them dirty boys lurking, if they nab me then it's curtains
So when I go see a person, I spin the block so I'm certain
That it's cool, I'm no fool, see Raul is more than reckless
So I meet him when it's busy at that Meeker/Morgan exit
Off that BQE near Mickey D's
And occasionally treat myself to a nice little fish and cheese
I'm really, really in the street. Being broke's my enemy
Teachers said I'm dumb but I dropped out and I know chemistry
I make that soft get hard and meet my homey Pito
In the parking lot of Home Depot off Northern Boulevard
I got my route down pat, I'm about my stacks
And my mouth don't chat, I let my Pow Pow clap
But I ain't with that though -- I'm trying to get that dough
Beamer, Benz or Bentley - oh no - I stay low in that:

[Verse 2 - Jim Jones]
I remember gettin' souped when I first had the Ac
It was the '9-7 coupe, I didn't know how to act
When Juju did the stash, the body shop on Jerome Seven Fourth
Way before the Boost I had the flip mobile phone
Before that it was the beeper, had one street-sweeper
We all cut class so we hardly knew the teacher
When The Rink was really hot, rockin' minks was really hot
We was on the car waggers wasn't thinking about a drop
Now I scoop you in the Charger, drop you off in the 'ghini
Let you out on the corner right before your boyfriend see me
Keep a low vehicle when I'm low speedin' through
And I'm scoopin' up your ho, they don't notice that it's you
Used to watch my uncle do it, scoop 'em up in the Buick
One chick Dolores turned fiend, she was gorgeous
Speakin' about cars, I think we still got a Taurus
I ain't gon' mention bout the color cause it's still takin' orders
