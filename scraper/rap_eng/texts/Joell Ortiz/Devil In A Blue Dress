Y'all don't know
It wasn't always like this yo

I used to cop it for 65 a gram
Add the Quinine cut throw it into the grinder till it's sand
Had the bags already stamped ink drying and then bam
Lil scoop and the half tape tying rubber bands
A couple hundred dollars used to make a couple grand
I was trying to step it up see this thing had other plans
I found myself wanting to bag up as much as I can
No mask on my face no gloves on my hand
Used to be at that table feeling cool as a fan
Smoking my cigarette sipping brew from a can
And one day I said "Fuck It!" I'm doing it man
To this day I tell myself just how stupid I am
I ran to that bathroom and threw up my ham
Then my eyes got low like a dude from Japan
The high was incredible I felt like a pimp
Knew I was walking regular but it felt like a limp
But that little bag a day would no longer keep me high
I moved to the next phase I was doing 3 to 5
My nod became serious my head by my ribs
Embarrassed to see my boys I served heads out the crib
Remember like it was yesterday this custy said "Joell
Can I do this in your kitchen, man I'm feeling sick as hell?"
I sat there and watched him heat the spoon with the flame
Extract the heroin and shoot it in his vein
I told him "Tie me up." Tapped my arm until the vein showed
Then he injected me and everything became
Soo ssllooww wwhhooa
Now I wake up sick
My bones be in pain I gotta taste that drip
When I can't get off E I gotta make up shit
Hoping they give me credit or somebody got a sample
It's turning into a monster My body's an example
Sometimes I skin pop shoot it in my skin
Don't even look for a vein I just want it to go in
Shit make me so itchy man all I do is scratch
My arm could do its own album its got some many tracks
Bumps all over me foot sores from all the stepping
Face drawn in like them things from I Am Legend
Headbanger fell off traffic like a seven
They said that GooGoo good I might try that in a second
But now the veins in my arms is dead
I gotta shoot up in calves instead
That's what you gotta do to get a fix
My partner ain't got no veins this nigga shooting in his dick
Anybody got a shop I'm selling food stamps
Last night I broke into a car I gotta cool amp
I like my living room dark. Who wanna a new lamp?
Gotta get my hands on that bag with the blue stamp
Meet the lady all my dudes stress
The Devil don't wear no Prada, the Devil's In A Blue Dress
