[Intro]
Strong Island, Keith Murray, Miami, DJ EFN

[Verse 1: Joell Oritz]
Oh you feel that you crazy? What make you crazy?
What make you feel above this rusty 380?
What make you think you could walk through this crazy hood?
What make you think plea coppin' gon' do you any good?
Where you from? Who you know? Where you tryna go?
Don't answer that just listen before I let it blow
Why should I let you go? Boy you don't know
It's drama down here so much blood be wettin' the flo'
You got a pistol on you? You try and line me up
You try and get the drop on me little grimey fuck
Them niggas send you through for like 90 bucks
Dirty ass nigga just for that I should light you up
Or maybe I'm just p'noid?
Maybe you just passin' through my hood and I'm a wild ass d-boy
Either way I got the drop can't fall back
So e'rything is your pockets I need all that

[Hook]
Now can you say what you want? I tell you off top
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
Hit 'em with a little, hit 'em with a lot
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
So is you wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
You wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
If you ain't really wit' us then shut the fuck up!

[Verse 2: Chris Rivers]
Yo my heart's incarcerated with bars that I jot on pages
The hardest artist regardless my verses are carbon plated
Soon as a six spitter diminish ya six figures
A vision the gift to winners depicted as Chris Rivers
Switch hitter, two face niggas get hit viciously
One on each side cause lord knows I love my symmetry
Mentally I'm parallel to all you niggas lyrically
You will never come close touch, or even visit me
Nothin' to lose, blast rush in these shoes
I love music spit a verse and bust a nut in the booth
You fuckin with truth, chubby nigga chasin' that cheese toast
Knock a nigga out runnin' his mouth it's the east coast
Planet earth, pack a hearse spectacular vernacular
Ambassador I'm smashin' you amateurs with excalibur
King or the fiend wanna be slaughtered be destroyer
All I do is make music drink water skeet daughters

[Hook]
Now can you say what you want? I tell you off top
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
Hit 'em with a little, hit 'em with a lot
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
So is you wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
You wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
If you ain't really wit' us then shut the fuck up!

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
I'll be damn if I do, I'll be damn if I don't
Take a chance to get rich, I'll be damn if I won't
Will I chrome when I tote? You know the shit is dope
Where I'm from in the streets, you know hope floats
This elixir mr. got a maze in Vista
On your girl, mom and sister play a naked Twister
Thought I was sleep no, hybernatin'
Comin' out poppin' Murray gets it shakin'
Terror on the streets, terror on the beats
Era I'm a eat, watch what you say to Keith
My Furious Five pack toasters no holsters
Find the grandmaster and the Flash is over
D-E-F, DJ EFN
It's a Crazy Hood we livin' in
I'm a grow regardless nigga nuff said
Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead

[Hook]
Now can you say what you want? I tell you off top
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
Hit 'em with a little, hit 'em with a lot
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
So is you wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
(Fuck bein' tired, I'll rest when I'm dead!)
You wit' me? (whattup) You wit' me? (whattup)
If you ain't really wit' us then shut the fuck up!
