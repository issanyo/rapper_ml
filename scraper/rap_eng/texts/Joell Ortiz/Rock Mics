[Verse One] [Joell Ortiz]:
First things first, ya'll not fuckin' with me
I'm so far from a sucka MC
From off stage I spot the bitch that'll suck a MC
Finish the show and grab that ho like, "You comin' with me."
The name's Joe, E double L O.R.T
An I.Z with an I.Z. you can find me on a Brooklyn block
Hand on my crotch, cannon cocked, I ain't shook to pop
You niggas is a son of a son, I'll mush your pops
Where I'm from, we don't pay off them crooked cops
We throw shots, really turn 'em into crooked cops
We pioneer back blocks with crack rocks stashed in that sock
Not that sock, that sock's cash I snatch gwap
Rap hot, my mascot barks
.44 Bulldog, your ass not walk again
They say when it rains it pours
My life real, it never even drizzled in yours

[Verse Two] [Butta Verses]:
Next thing's next, fuck rhymin' man, sign them checks
I got goals, way behind in debt, time to tick
Get ghost, I don't just want bread I want toast with the jam on it
(Nucleus joints) Get jam on it
You're foul I'mma And1 it, wild like a pandemic
Spread it and music or mankind get it
The lames can't follow anywhere I'm headed
I'm right there, wrong regret it, I'm bullheaded
I beeped your fiancee, nah, there's no wedding
Just a Dear John letter like I had to do better
I do it up right, cool, don't like to get uptight
But somethin' might pop, make the right guy drop
For the boys for the birds for the block this is what's what
This is what set it off, this is that hut hut
Fire off the line, my entire design
Just playin' five years, retire, I'm fine
That's right I'm so...

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three] [Butta Verses]
Mic trip off
The haters, make 'em pull back the boat
On a Colt, fire that off, you feel the jolt
Take quotes from something I spoke, I glow and I gloat
Behind the times, enemy lines, they catch a catapult
They ain't made they a myth
I bet I, treat 'em like a Jedi
Youngling I'm a Sith and they weak then the shield lifts
Still a little stiff
Tell 'em stretch it out, you dealin' with your destiny now
Uh huh
