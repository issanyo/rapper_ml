[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Sometimes I wonder if he knows I love him
I don't feel that daddy squeeze when I hug him
He says "I love you" when he hangin' up the phone but it's muffled
Like he's uncomfortable sayin' it, so his voice has trouble
Gettin' the words out, his mother gave up bein' my baby
She packed her bags and hit Atlanta when he was a baby
Man them first couple of years it was crazy
I'm back and forth to child support then she agreed he could stay with me
On Christmas vacations, I would lift him up, raise him
So high in the air, my eyes tearin', this kid is amazin'
This year is the fourth generation PlayStation I know he's awaitin'
It's under that tree waitin'
It's that look on his face when he's happy that makes me proud to be daddy
When he runs over and grabs me, filled with true joy
In the same moment I'm bothered, I mean he knows I'm his father
But am I just that once-a-year homie with new toys?

[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
Sometimes I wonder if rap is a gift
Every 25th he's unwrappin' his gifts
Pardon me if I curse when I'm rappin' and shit
But sometimes a fuckin' curse comes wrapped as a gift
A curse comes wrapped as a gift
Sometimes a fuckin' curse comes wrapped as a gift
Every 25th he's unwrappin' his gifts
Am I a bad Santa?

[Verse 2: Jared Evan]
Will you show up in the middle of night?
Will you be the one to turn off the lights?
I hope so
When I see you, everything is alright
But will you really be here tonight?
I don't know
It's like all this time, I've been wanderin', waiting for you
You stay on my mind, cause I belong to you
Santa...

But sometimes a fuckin' curse comes wrapped as a gift
A curse comes wrapped as a gift
Sometimes a fuckin' curse comes wrapped as a gift
Every 25th he's unwrappin' his gifts
Am I a bad Santa?

[Bridge: Joell Ortiz]
It's you I'll always be there for
I'm just wishin' I could be there more
This music's keepin' me on tour
But I'll be right back to see my boy
