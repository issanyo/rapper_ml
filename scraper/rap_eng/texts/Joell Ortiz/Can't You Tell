"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game" - Jay-Z 'Blue Magic'

[Verse One]:
Natural born hustler
Satisfying a customer
With this little box along side my jugular
I got the voice of a champ, flow like the levee broke
Fade away? I bet a Dre publishing check he won't
I love money too much, I gotta have it
It been like this for some time, I got a habit
Of lickin' my thumbs
And flippin' through ones and crumbled fives
Before rap made them hundreds arrive
That was me (where?)
On that block, drunk with some of my guys
With bundles and dollar signs in each one of our eyes
Sometime we stay there until the sun would arrive
When you awake, I'm in last nights clothes gettin' that cake
Till the last bit of work was gone and then I skate
So it's nothin' personal Interscope, I couldn't wait
I need a release date cause a date mean doe
I hope my fans understand and don't hate me though
But yo

[Chorus]:
Y'all just be lookin' tough, I'm in the lab cookin' up
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"
Product of my environment, that's why I got the fire, kick
"Can't you tell that I came..."

Y'all just be lookin' tough, I'm in the lab cookin' up
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"
Product of my environment, that's why I got the fire, kick
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"

[Verse Two]:
See, in the game I came from we was poor
So when you got a lot of gwap, you ain't stop you get more (let's go!)
Don't think a little change gon' make me lounge
You rappers ain't safe until the Lord send his angels down
Man, this life don't owe you, you got a lot of nerve
Everything I get, I get cause I get what I deserve
Cause I earned it
Y'all see how I design them words
Some of y'all say I'm a nerd but it's easy to find a verb
Couple adjectives and some nouns and give it rhymin' swerve
And make it fly like when guys come and buy a bird
See, a lot of my metaphors from the dope game
If you ain't from there, you won't hear/hair them, you need Rogaine
Truth of the matter is, I came up wearing no name
My mom used to tell me, "Walk ahead" to buy her cocaine
And food stamps held me down like steel
That's a large part of the reason I feel how I feel
But yo

[Chorus]:
Y'all just be lookin' tough, I'm in the lab cookin' up
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"
Product of my environment, that's why I got the fire, kick
"Can't you tell that I came..."

Y'all just be lookin' tough, I'm in the lab cookin' up
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"
Product of my environment, that's why I got the fire, kick
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"

[Verse Three]:
Uhhh
Ain't a damn thing promised in the dope game
Money make your man dishonest in the dope game
I'm tellin' you, the guns the hottest in the dope game
So please don't turn Carl Thomas in the "dope game"
And get emotional, just do what you supposed to do
Producers send more than one beat cause I'm tryin' to roast a few
And keep my snare poppin'
And DJ's hands choppin'
The Ortiz high won't die, it'll keep the fans coppin'
The haters is man jockin', they mad cause my Hancock is
In big bold letters on checks and they waitin' on Flex
To drop a bomb, I'm Vietnam, your boy ill watch
Everything there gon' disappear like my real pops
Hustler ambition
Dope boy grindin'
Don't forget I'm old boy that Snoop's homeboy signed (Dre)
Things happen for a reason, y'all gon' know Joe name
I left the packs I'm with the tracks, this my new dope game
But yo

[Chorus]:
Y'all just be lookin' tough, I'm in the lab cookin' up
"Can't you tell that I came from the dope game"
Product of my environment, that's why I got the fire, kick
"Can't you tell that I came..."
