[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Yo, it can't be louder than my voice
Throw a rose in the Royce
Riding with ya boy
I provide waves from the flows with the tone
Remembering the days with the throw away phones
Watch the cops infiltrating what drug free zone
And how we used to feel when the homies came home
And bbq still get lit
No pig
With the party pack
If anybody ask for a cig
I don't wanna be old
Being owed
Put a mill in the bank for my son
Keep it froze till he 21
What
If you got ears than you hear me
If you gotta problem better kill me
I done seen the worst of the worst in the worst way
Undercover TNT Tuesday's and Thursday's
Uh
Harlem
Spanish in the front of that
Looking for another like me
Tell me where he at
I done took my hood to Chile and Mississippi
I wonder if I really retire who gonna miss me
I wonder who gonna fill up my shoes and do it bigger
I relate to whoever that care to listen to me nigga
Little arrogant
But I'm always frontline
I could fuck your bitch
But I really like mine
Sitting on a crate, slippers on read the times
You lucky that I rhyme
Cause I really like crime
I'm built like this
You lucky that I rhyme cause I really like crime
I'm built like this
You lucky that you rhyme cause I really like crime

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
I'm built like this
Lucky that I rhyme cause I’m such a fuckin' dime
Nigga, I’m built like this
Ya lucky that I rhyme cause I'm such a fuckin' dime
Tell them bitches hold up like I’m on the other line
Young honey in my prime
Keep a chica under mine
I just put the lime in the coconut and shine
Now these labels wanna dine with me
Fuck around and sign
I don't know, but the facts is these rap niggas clap for me
Never dab but my trap niggas got daps for me
Just a little loopy so they always run it back for me
She gon the lick the cat, tickle that, roll the pack for me
Damn, coulda been another kinda plan
Coulda been another fan watching idols on the gram
Now I’m Miami cooking jams with the man
Talking Puerto Rican power wit that Yaowa and the Bamz
Lucky that I rather eat a rapper when I ain't full
Instead of calling up ya chick to sit up on my facial
Yeah, I know bad bitch would suffice
But why you I’m flashing these dimples boo?
I’m nice
I'm built like this
Nigga, I’m built like this
Lucky that I rhyme cause I’m such a fuckin' dime
Ya lucky that I rhyme cause I'm such a fuckin' dime

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Built like this, ya lucky that I rhyme
Every motherfuckin' line blow your motherfuckin' mind
Like a motherfuckin' mine so watch who you step to, nigga, I'm
A product of crack rock in blacktops reebok blacktops
A fat Glock pop, push black top mad blocks away
This is pre-Dr. Dre
Chasing aftermath, no Detox today
Get another E&J and some plastic cups
Two green and one red dice, a bag, a Dutch
And watch out for the gold car they acting up
Dope line around the corner cause my stamp was tough
Anybody see Joell I was such a creep
Project roof with a freak called it Pebble Beach
I went through all the phases, flat tops to waves
To sitting between her legs getting tender headed braids
With the black comb
Nextel with the chirp that’s the bat phone
My legacy do way more than last long
I still stroll through my hood in slippers when I go back home

[Outro]
I'm built like this
Y'all lucky that I rhyme cause I really like 9s
I'm built like this
Lucky that I rhyme cause I’m such a fuckin' dime
I'm built like this
Y'all lucky that I rhyme cause I really like 9 Millimeters and a liter of that good Bacardi lime
Some fine weed to smoke and a dime
Oh I'm built like this
You lucky that you rhyme cause I really like crime
