[Joell Ortiz]
One plus one ain't always two
It's one me, one music we want and it's wonderful
That's why I still get upset when y'all wonder who
Is the best, I'm in the flesh, mic check, one, two
I said "Is this thing working? Do y'all not hear me?"
Like err website keep they dot-com near me
I'm on the playlist in these kid's iPods
Fuck execs, all their interns think I'm hard
I don't go up to radio to talk
So lose the questions, bring up a beat and I'll freak New York
Make you wanna go to the roof and clamp the heat you bought
Cause you be pumped like the feet on the skeets I tossed
They say "Me, I'm more", I say "Me, not yours
But me like your culo so me want more"
And they know the routine, we ain't gotta rehearse
And shorty give me back shots like I shot at her first
