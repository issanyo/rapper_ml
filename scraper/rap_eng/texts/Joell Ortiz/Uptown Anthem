[Verse]:
"Hey you can smoke a spliff" - Naughty By Nature
Hey you can say you spit
"Hey you can smoke a spliff"
Hey you can say you spit
Hey you can say you spit and you rip but I still don't think your rhymes is tough
Remind me of a duck
Your stories nasty daddy look at these Laffy Taffy ain't really classy
I'm unhappy with the rap scene
When I hit spots, hip hop just rocks
That proves the truth and so they root they Joell troops
I got a flow and my fans just know
That I'm real, I'm not my garbage competition that chase doe
Beats I take, then smoke like coke and haze
I split up in a philly on a ?, so tell a hater
Get off my dick, I'm not on Aftermath and that's it
But I don't really give a fuckin' shit
Your stories corny but mines greater
The majors said, "Nah big man tell big fam no Def Jam."
The other ones looked in my eyes, said that I'm no star
Now no matter where they turn there I are

[Chorus]:
We gotta break
Joey
We gotta bash
Joey
We gotta throw
Joey
We gotta smash
Joey
We gotta break
Joey
We gotta bash
Joey
We gotta throw
Joey
We gotta smash
Joey
