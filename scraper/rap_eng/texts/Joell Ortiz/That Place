[Intro]
Here we go again, huh?
I meet you over there
I can't stand that place, man
Never know what's goin' happen in there, man
Good news, bad news, shit

[Verse 1]
Pacin' back and forth in that hospital hall
No phone signal, I could not get a call
Ain't speak to doctors at all
My homie voice in my head like, "you got a game today?
I'm watchin' you ball, I'll be there soon, let me stop at the store"
Had one of them off-games, I couldn't get one shot to just fall
The coach benched me, it's forty-somethin' to like
Forgot, what's the score?
I open my flip to like a barrrage of missed calls
From anonymous but a lot that I know
I hit my partner back, "yo?"
Here's like it's Ral my nigga, they shot him up, Joell
He like, "I'm parked outside the apartment, let's go!"
I left my gym bag and hopped in
Not him, we just chopped it up
He said he was on his way to watch me shoot
And now they shot him up
I'm in the ER like, "where my boy, man?" They shot him up
A bloody gurney races by, he looks at me, they shot him up to ICU
I lost my homie on that third floor
Can't believe that I'm the last person he saw

[Chorus]
I swear to God I hate the hospital
I can't even stand the smell of that place
It's the sin of sickness and death, tears dwell on your face
They whisper news but hit you like they yelled in your face, man
I swear to God I hate the hospital
I mean no disrespect to what the nurses or the doctors do
Sometimes y'all make a miracle appear from the impossible
But when my people there, gettin' outta there's an obstacle

[Verse 2]
Pacin' back and forth in that hospital hall
No phone signal, I could not get a call
Ain't hear from doctor's at all
My momma voice in my head, like
"This ain't a game, don't let them condoms come off"
But I wanted to feel it so I'ma go raw just one time
But one time mean every time
And one time that fun time ain't quite pull out in time
And now it's son time
I walk into the room, throw on some scrubs
My baby mom's pushin'
Screamin' for that Depo shot, squeezin' on my arm
Lookin' down at her private, cryin', in hope's to hear cryin'
I am in shock as the top of his head came pokin' out
Why is it split in half?
That's when I noticed he was feet first, breech birth
Umbillical 'round his neck it made him breathe worse
They tryna reposition 'em before she deliver
I'm prayin', "please work"
My first born cannot meet earth before he meet Earth
The cord unravels, the battle's won, tears pour
I can't believe I'm the first person he saw

[Chorus]
I swear to God I hate the hospital
I can't even stand the smell of that place
It's the sin of sickness and death, tears dwell on your face
They whisper news but hit you like they yelled in your face, man
I swear to God I hate the hospital
I mean no disrespect to what the nurses or the doctors do
Sometimes y'all make a miracle appear from the impossible
But when my people there, gettin' outta there's an obstacle

[Outro]
R.I.P. all the fallen soldiers
You gone but you still here though
Welcome, to all the new life, yeah
