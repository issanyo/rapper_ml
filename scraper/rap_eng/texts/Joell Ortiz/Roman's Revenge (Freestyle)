[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jazmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead these bums is laggin'

[Verse: Joell Ortiz]
Yao, wa
Roar, roar, like a Brooklyn lion
Flow got good hearin', deaf defyin'
Anybody thought that they're actually wildin'
I kill the bad man like Dexter, stylin'!
Razor under me tongue, for extra smilin'
Laser under me gun, no lesson firin'
Nike stock room, yeah the checks is pilin'
I'm getting my green up like Rex-y Ryan
Once I chitter-chattered on the track your little blabber didn't matter
Sped your flow up I did it faster
Made it slow up like a appli -- cation
Download on a old PC without a camera
You edible I'm so incredible, Bruce Banner
Hang it up fresh nail and a hammer
Soft way and you can't fuck with Joell Banners
You a flush I'm 'Full House' Michelle Tanner,
Never floss for my 6 got a ho scanner
I'm out here spinnin' a wheel tryna bone banners
Spit ill, so throat cancer
I'm grindin why you whinin'? Pole dancer
Hip-hop is my boo I'm a romance her
Wear it out, rub her feet when her toes cramp up
Even though I know you have no chance to
Hit it, here go the digits, no answer
Grab life by the horns I got both antlers
Giddy-up, pretty buck, nope don't scamper
Take this dick, embrace the tip
Steak that drips protein, mommy taste a sip
I'm on my A game when I'm on my basic shit
Only time I get a F is when I lace the whip
With gas, y'all trash my god I'm nice
So raw, raw, no condom, twice
Yao, wa
