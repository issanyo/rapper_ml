[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]

I don't look left and right when I write
Full steam ahead on this ten speed bike
I pedal you through the ghetto where they peddle hard white
And metal will have your mom in falsetto all night
Every cup is plastic, every dutch is mastered
Everyone's fucking blasted, celebrating another night
No one got fucking blasted, dice rollin' the cards shuffle
It's a sixty a bagel and seventy for a hard bundle (c'mon)
Them D boys got the grind hot
Cameras errywhere we serve fiends in the blind spot
Prices went up so them baggies came down
Cutsies don't give a fuck long as that high's still around
That's real rap nigga, a lot of y'all just real rat niggas
Just put words together, never bought work to shred up
In your momma kitchen wishing it was the first forever
Literally hunger driven for this cheddar
Better watch it boys
I'm on a mission give me vomit noise
Hold your stomach throw up sick when you hear that Yaowa voice (YAOWA!)
I hope you haven't forgotten
I started this atom from the apple and its rotten
My Adam's Apple and larynx get it popping y'all mimicking me
Secretively under my umbrella Mary Poppins
My alter ego's a quarter of the slaughter
But all alone y'all fuck boys Sodom and Gomorrah
I don't want to call a truce this is an order
Every hip-hop supporter
Tell your favorite rapper get out the water
Little 'Octopussy' swimming 'round a orca
That's predatory torture
National Geographic make a offer
You dealing with a different kind of monster
Walk up in AMC and shoot a fucking feared one with a walker
They handing out awards but I ain't running out of swords
I'll cut your hand off for trying to grab what's not yours
You want a war well its war you got
And I ain't got it all man that's all you got?
My bath water was hot from a boiling pot
You lil lukewarm twats meet my balls and cock
No more nice guy, I'm fed up
I put some Shady bread up
Built a studio now I'm set up to never let up
If anything I say strike a nerve we can go head up
I let these Air Max give your asshole a check up
The nod that I give to these beats'll twist your neck up
Give you the Elvis lip, make you want to lift a TEC up
Fire to everything around you dry, soaking wet up
The mind of a poor child and '89 music
250 Broadway, 8am standing in line-music
The staple in your money grind movement
My hood people know what it do
When them 1's, 5's and 10's was red, yellow and blue
It's okay to be scared this what veterans do
Y'all lying, man your closet is a skeleton zoo
You don't fit my size youngin' this one hell of a shoe
My dope scale was Wonder Woman, yeah my heroin(e) flew
Pre-rap, man my crack;
Used to hop off the plate when I cut it
And my coke; you couldn't feel your face it would numb it
And my E? Nah I never sold that
But I popped a couple of 'em nigga fuck it
I don't care if they post that last line in them tabloids
And it's on MediaTakeOut makin' mad noise
I rubber band my arm and shoot rap 'roids
Rip your face off like Castroy with this pad boy!
Man I don't care who on the way up
I blow right past them look back and tell 'em "Stay up!"
I'm so BK'd up, I'mma help keep Jay up
Two years from now I'mma fill that Barclay up
You niggas make fast breaks feel like hard lay-ups
Make a walk in the park feel like a marathon, wait up
This shit ain't fucking rocket science
You want your shit to take off you put the hardest Puerto rock behind it
I know the law but I'm not complying
Fuck Wall Street I hold heat on on every street I'm occupying
You could feel so alone when your partner die and
Every night it's like they throw Patron man them shots is flying
So we duck, duck, goose, sippin' on that grey hoop
Trying to cranberry juice they whole stoop
Last week we made an example out of some floop
Like a real good sample I'm never out of the loop
Cause I don't call or check in
I rolls up, hops out, post up and toast up with real niggas repping
Think shit a movie ain't no theaters in my section
Just Orville Redenbachers that'll pop off in seconds
I'm watching hip-hop and it's sad
Whole bunch of misguided niggas trying to fit in
And mirrors trying to wiggle into pants they don't fit in
How could you ever be a stand out when you just sit in?
And copy what everybody doing, it's probably not even you
Now y'all matching squares like a capicu
You really like your socks that color?
Y'all wearing space suits off of Star Trek brother
Whatever! I'm here to rap, maybe my hat a snap
But I did that way back I ain't new to that
I could throw on 40 belows, army pants, a bubble goose
And some big ass goggles and say "I bodied that!"
But it was done before, if y'all bringing back
Back in the days what y'all fronting for?
Screaming yaowa loud, in ten years I still be
Hot dog, getting buzz while you rock in front of sour crowds
I swear I'm having fun I'm sparring, but that's not the scary part
The scary part is I ain't done evolving
Who want try and come and solve him?
Like soft dick and dry ass pussy I'm a fuckin' problem!
