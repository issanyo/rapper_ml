[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Uh, I got bitches on my dick, I don't want 'em near
Closet full of brand names, I don't wanna wear
Everybody got advice that I don't wanna hear
World in your palm but you don't wanna share
Still I'm followin you - are you leadin me with a weapon drawn?
Co-dependent on her but got me in bed alone
You say if you love it let it go, nothin set in stone
Plus every rock they throw, I use as a stepping stone
Got questions, say the answer's better left unknown
Though I may not never see you, I should know you never gone
So I break the mirror, cause everything it's showin me is wrong
Grab your hand and go along - cause I'm followin you
I say I should be pleased, what if I'm saddened?
Always say I've been through worse, what if I haven't?
But if that holds true, here's the lesson
If you keep your head down, you might miss out on the blessing, sing

[Hook - Joe Budden] - w/ ad libs
I don't need the money (money), I don't need the fame (fame)
I don't need the lifestyle, I don't need the pain (pain)
I don't need the clubs (uh), I don't need the cars
None of that really matters to me (whoa)
I don't want the bad bitch, I don't want the strain (nope)
I don't want the highs, enough shit on the brain
I don't want whatever's gonna help me be sane
I just wanna follow your lead

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
You sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead
Brought me to my knees, he must wanna holla at me
When the world feel like swallowin me
When every decision costly and I ain't got a dollar on me
Check it, I don't wanna pretend, I don't wanna live a lie
I don't wanna be judged, don't wanna be criticized
I don't wanna talk, there's nothin I wanna say
The more I let 'em get to know me, the more they just run away
And that, must be your way of sayin we should stay together
I know how to fuck it up more than I can make it better
I figured folk around me would learn to take it better
Instead of tryin change me, I've been this way forever
Time will reveal more will be shown
You pushed it, I thought the door closed on it's own
But uh, nevermind what caused it
Livin a dream, nothin in this world powerful enough to pause it, sing

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
He's sayin follow my lead, follow, follow my lead (uh)
Cig in my mouth, prescription bottle by me
And even when I think you might be makin a mistake
I may not know the destination but I make it there safe
Check it, when I feel like I can't get weaker, uh
You always come and make a cameo or feature
I'm good with my insanity and fevers
Cause Pac's lookin from heaven sayin "they ain't understand me neither"
A lot of times you leave me exposed
And laugh at me, still thinkin I could be in control
Help me weather the storm, altogether I ain't know him
Cause I always disagree, though you ain't never been wrong
Listen, I was feelin nearly unstoppable
And now I'm facin what appeared to be impossible
Feelin unimportant enough to have to bother you
But I'm down here alone nigga, all I got is you

[Break - Unknown Female Singer]
Uh, follow my leeeead
Follow my lead

[Verse 4 - Joell Ortiz]
Check it (yaowa), I can't fit it all in a sixteen
The night that I was tipsy and all them bullets just missed me (oh!)
The day they rushed the block, I was strapped but they didn't frisk me
(Damn) Why I ain't fuck that stripper? Don't ask and now she's sick B
The drop on that jewelry store for fifty
And I backed out last minute like "nah, this shit look risky"
One of my mans dead, the other one in Poughkeepsie (man)
Another one in the Feds, he'll be there until he's sixty (no!)
I want to thank you for the blessings and the gifts
And the lessons and the messages they left, I get the drift (I know)
Fuck the cheddar or whatever, it don't measure up to this (naw)
I mean never did I ever not remember you exist (woo!)
When I hop up out my bed, hands together and I wish
Swear to you it's from the heart, inside my chest you let it tick (thank you)
I love you from the soul with every spiritual molecule (word)
Fuck Twitter, all a nigga gotta do is follow you
