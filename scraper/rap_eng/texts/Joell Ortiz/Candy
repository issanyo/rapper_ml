I call her candy
My honey bun
My sugar pie
My candy
She give me everything I want
I call her candy
And if it all came crashing down
I still got candy
My candy girl

[Verse 1:Joell Oritz]
That's right, uhh
My sweet lil sumthin' sumthin'
No matter what I ain't givin' baby up for nothin'
Cuz she was there when Joell was just a motherfuckin'
Tryna rap basketball player, tryna hustle onions
Y'all don't know what we been through
It wasn't simple
She was bringing them ends through when it was rent due
I would scoop her from uptown inside that rental
Drive gentle, niggas staring cause she a 10 too
Flyest thing on the block, had to bag her up
She look soft but hardbody I be cracking up
My lil' boo be doing big things
Shorty got a bunch of nicknames but

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz}
Yup, uhh
We manuevered around the ups and downs
Them times I ain't go to pick her up I was fucking rounds
She still put all that money up when they was coming downtown
To bail me out when I bailed on her for a couple pounds
She bought me all my Air Max's and I would run the town
Spinning Pun around in my CD player and bubble down
If it wasn't for shorty wop y'all wouldn't love my sound
Candy funded all of my early work on the underground
Before the red eye flights and all the limelight
I lived the high life baby she had my mind right
24/7 from AM until the twilight
Baby made sure I was a'ight

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mally Stakz]
Say you're my candy girl
Ooh girl you rock my world
I know you love me
Can't nobody take you from me
Nah
Say you're my candy girl
Ooh girl you rock my world
I know you love me
Can't nobody take you from me
Nah nah

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
It's hard to find a love like this y'all
We hung out on the 6th floor when I was piss poor
Tired the elevator broke and it was piss all
On the staircase so we stepped it up, they was pissed off
Cuz you turn a hope that into a cold fact
They watch them dirty Bo Jack's become a gold Ac
I'm married to a new bitch and shorty know that
But she'll be ready if I go back

[Hook]
