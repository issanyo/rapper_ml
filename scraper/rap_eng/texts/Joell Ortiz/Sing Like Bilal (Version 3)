You remove the big label that be backin' them (uh)
The moistened nine, ice the fake platinum
And bring it back to rap I will flatten them
I'm the best across the board like Tat and 'em
New York, if you feelin' like me then you tired
Of listenin' to liars, wishin' it was fire
But none of them is hot not the flicker of a lighter
I'm about to blow up in they face Richard Pryor
Your industry buzz ain't valid on the streets loser
We don't care about them mags and them weak rumors
Your secret wack parties with free hookah
Ev'rybody walkin' 'round tryin' to be cooler
Nah! See I be where they keep ruegers
You ain't got to be in beefs the police shoot ya
The ox will give ya a ill buck fifty
New rappers is cool but we still bump Biggie (Baby)
I walk and perfects with a ill one with me
Fitted to the side on my Brooklyn shit
No V.I.P. I ain't shook for shit
I'm at the bar like after push ups and dips
As for this mic they don't want nothin' (Why?)
'Cause I eat 'em for breakfast, oatmeal corn muffins
Lil' insects y'all all buggin'
Flex I got you, next time I'll call up and record somethin'

W-When you hear-W-W-When you heard me rewind me
From the city where niggas known for puttin' in work
I-I-I-I make 'em nervous, I do it on purpose
W-When you hear-W-W-When you heard me rewind me
From the city where niggas known for puttin' in work
This here serious
Sing-Sing like Bilal

Check, I see your mouth movin, but you ain't sayin' nothin'
Ya boy's speakers all heat like my neighbor's oven
If I'm anywhere near a mic, then I'm claimin' somethin'
I can't resist "The Temptation", David Ruffin'
Haha! Who feelin froggy? Hop, kiddo!
I see to it Miss Piggy is a chopped widow
Before I saw gwap from Joell features
I had the corner on lock, Darrelle Revis
It's so I treat rap like coke, bet it
You want lines, gimme mines, homie no credit
Y'all was hyped about homes like, no sweat it
He turned out to be a "Bus", Jerome Bettis
I'm on my chiro shit now, +back+ at it
Steady spittin' that crack, I'm a crack addict
The belt sittin' on my wiast, take a crack at it
My craft'll put you to sleep, hehe, Craftmatic
