Classic!

"Big-Big L, rest in peace!" - DJ Premier

A couple things changed…with Ebonics…

[Verse One]:
A bag of piff is my herb
A key of coke is a bird
When I’m twisted, I’m slurred
With new gear on I swerve
Cars is wheels and sneakers is heels
Money is loot, movies is boot
Also, pads is homes
Horns is cell phones
Cocaine’s a little shveer
Cigarettes still bones
A radio is extinct
Anything sharp is a shank
A little ice is some rocks
And boys is cops
And if you got robbed they had drop
You got shot, you got popped
And if you got double crossed, you got got
Your bankroll’s in your jeans
A choke hold is a fiend
A scribe is a note
Akon is a singer yo
And if you got punched that mean you got cracked
If you clean you off crack
If you mean, you hardcore rap
I know y’all like the way I’m freakin’ it
I talk with slang that’s that Brooklyn Puerto Rican shit

[Hook]:
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill

[Verse Two]:
A burglary is a crib
A job’s a gig
Pun, L and Smalls explained the meaning of Big
If you caught a felony, you got a stripe
If you got killed you got stretched
And if your shit is bangin’ you got bad breath
When you, 730 we say you special
Hit you on the hip means text you
Angel dust is coffee
If you got AIDS, you got the bug
And if shorty got your meat burnin’ then you got the rub
Layin’ up is to chill
Guns and pistols is steel
Condoms is shields
Cracks is crills
The food you eat is a face slice
A victim’s a vic
A dead room is a small club
A yama’s a chick
Your apartment is your crash
And I don’t know what’s a dad
The studio is the booth, when tight I’m mad
I know y’all like the way I’m freakin’ it
I talk with slang that’s that Brooklyn Puerto Rican shit

[Hook]:
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill

[Verse Three]:
The iron horse still a name but, champagne just bub though
Shorty’s straight up ugly she’s an ug’ mo’
If I say she nice then she fine
A fatty’s her behind
Brain ain’t her mind
It’s somethin’ you love before you grind
Genuine’s that ass
A big face is what you put inside your stash
Nigga’s grill, we say they put on a mask
If you creepin’ to see a chick like every other weekend
You slidin’, not cheatin’, but everyday is beastin’
Stinkin’ is hummin’
If you throwin’ you cummin’
All the hustlers is dumbin’
A brick of coke, thirty somethin’
A room key is a telly
Peanut butter and jelly’s called a salmonella
Don’t wanna put that in your bellies
Strong arming is to use physical force
If you focused then you on course
If you the man you a boss
I know y’all like the way I’m freakin’ it
I talk with slang that’s that Brooklyn Puerto Rican shit

[Hook]:
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill
Speak with lyrical slang
That’s just the way that I talk yo
Vocabulary spills, I’m ill
