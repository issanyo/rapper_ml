[Intro]
This nigga with the [?] let's rob him, bro
What you said? Yo, what?
Yo, where my mother fuckin' [?]
The toolie really 'bout to come out
Mmhm, not true, dawg
Shit

[Verse 1]
These bitches tell it all, you ain't special, nigga
It's what that pussywhip pillow talk'll get'cha
You ain't even know I knew Vanessa, did ya?
That's beside the point
From man hunt to escapin' that manhunt when we robbed the joint
We smoke L's to the brain on the roof
Washed it down with a cup of E&J and a Loosey
We got fly and rode trains to the Deuce
When I got signed, I had models let niggas run train and chuck deuce
But when that change low, here the change go
And real niggas never 'pose to mention when they exchange dough
Them quote-unquote loans was gifts
Did I complain? No
'Cause you was my nigga
Now my nigga tryna line me up
Trust me, boy, I'm ready, fam
I got a whole lotta fetti and my shooters got a steady hand
So you come try to take what I used to offer
That block where you stand is that block they gon' scrap you off of

[Break]
Word to my mother (mother)
Word to my mother (mother)

[Verse 2]
I can't stand you, you can't stand me
Later on at night, fine and dandy
We break up Monday, Tuesday: Family
That was just us though 'cause you was my candy
Sweeter than a licorice Twizzler, thicker than a snicker
My little snack, I go way back wit'cha
I paid your mom's rent when that welfare dissed her
Put hands on that dude that used to hit yo' sister
For this song, you'll be Melissa
Melissa, you let me down, I thought you'd always be my hitta
My hitta been makin' rounds, I saw the paperwork on Victor
You pointin' niggas out, singin' like The Pointer Sisters?
Damn, nigga, what'chu gon' say?
You'd never tell on me or put a sell on me?
Not Joell Ortiz
Do me a favor, lose that number to that cell on me
And, respectfully, get the hell out of my V

[Break]
Word to my mother (mother)
Word to my mother (mother)

[Outro]
Why?
Why?
