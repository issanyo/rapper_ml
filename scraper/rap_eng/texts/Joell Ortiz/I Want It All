[Hook: Iffy The Badman]
I gotta get it before it’s too late
Oh I’ma go grab the moment so it won’t slip away
I just want it all, (I want it all yeah)
I just want it all
I want it all

[Verse 1 : Joell Ortiz]
More money, more money, more money
I wanna feel like new money till I’m old, money
We ain't have no money, mami will owe money
Now I gets show-money, mami can blow money
I ain’t stuntin', naw, this is celebration
Poverty strickin' hood nigga, elevation
Man I’m just dealin' with these adaptations
Tryin to get use foreign car acceleration
Enjoyin' all this foreign broad penetration, man
I can’t believe I fucked one of those
Those the one from slumdog in them bummy clothes
Bad body pretty eyes extra funny nose
Who knows, I did, climb out of the loop holes, I did
When you close your eye lids, Dream!
Of a beautifully perfect get away
Now wake up and get it, don't let it slip away!

[Hook: Iffy The Badman]
I gotta get it before it’s too late
Oh I’ma go grab the moment so it won’t slip away
I just want it all, I want it all yeah
I just want it all
I want it all

[Verse 2 : Joell Ortiz]
I keep a hand sanitizer, I’m disgusting
Cause money filthy and that's all that I've been touchin'
You outside this bar, probably dressed, but that means nothin'
I’m fresh off the block with our guest so I get rushed in
Money moves everything
So money moved everything and sat in that section where "yeah
We can do anything" I’m doing just fine
Cause I’m Jesus with these rhymes so
Send a few more bottles yeah I said "let there be whine"
This lady show em everything that they mami designed
And it all makes sense So I’m surrounded by diamond
And now I’m all loud in spots I wasn't allowed
From being in the crowd to being the in-crowd
I be in a European that’s speedin', I slow down
Defeatin', pull on the lean in the seat and she goes down
And jeez, I can't believe she's still breathin', it feels beautiful
I tell her be easy, then nail her, cuticle

[Hook: Iffy The Badman]
I gotta get it before it’s too late
Oh I’ma go grab the moment so it won’t slip away
I just want it all, I want it all yeah
I just want it all
I want it all

[Bridge : Iffy The Badman]
I want it all, I ain’t got time to waste
I ain’t got time to waste, no
Every minute, every hour I'm paper chasin'
Baby, on the road to riches
And diamond rings
You can't settle for less when you work for everything
Cuz

[Hook: Iffy The Badman]
I gotta get it before it’s too late
Oh I’ma go grab the moment so it won’t slip away
I just want it all, I want it all yeah
I just want it all
I want it all
