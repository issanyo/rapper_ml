[Notorious B.I.G.]:
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck him, I didn't want to go to Heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talking 'bout some praise the lord shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her, and dump her body in the sewer
Our Father – My pops stuck up dope spots
Big black and mean with the fifth by the gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin?
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggas keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake?

[Joell Ortiz]:
I ain't here to make friendships
I'm already cool with a bunch of fool ass niggas that extend clips
And get they blast on
You'll be better off walkin' through Manhattan with a Bin Laden mask on
I walk in the club – hammer's get to passin'
You walk in to clubs with Hammer – you a has-been
I'm what's hot now, don't get mad at me
I'll make sure your ever after ain't happily
They'll bring flowers, light candles, post pictures up
Spray paint handball courts – dead nigga stuff
And you don't want that, so breathe easy, relax
The shotty make your body real easy to detach
The doc'll have a hard time trying to put your BACK together
So get your ACT together, scrap
Now who had said Puerto Ricans can't rap? (huh?)
Homeboy please, this is Joell Ortiz

[Jay-Z]:
When the gun is tucked, untuck - nigga you die
It's like nunchuks held by the Jet L-I
I'm the one thus, meanin' no one must try
No two, no three, no four, know why?
Because one's four-five might blow yo' high
You ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God
It's a match made in Heaven when I (bam!) 'splay the seven
Put you on the nigga news, UPN at 11
Where you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm
(bl-blast) that I'm so sin-surr?
I'm especially Joe Pesci with it friend
I will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again
