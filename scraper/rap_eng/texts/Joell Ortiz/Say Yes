[Intro: Sahlance]
If god came to you
And asked you: "Will you give me your all?"
Would you say "yes"?

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Lord, I'm all your's, forgive me for all flaws
There's so many, there's so many, there's so many
There's so many, there's so many, there's so many
I've been disobeying your laws
I've been living life how I felt, I been saying "yes" when I want
I've been dipping into temtation, it was that fool's gold that I'd flaunt
It was them devil riches I seeked
It was all of your jewels that I lost
Lord, I wanna take this time to thank you
Even when I starting driving off course
You ain't let me crash into that wall
Feel like I was never driving at all
I felt your hands all on that wheel
Heard your voice in every dope deal
Saw your light in every dark thought
I was out here, ignoring your will
I left your side, but you ain't leave mine
How many times I said "it's the last time"?
Lord, I just gotta get off this last time
I'mma get a job, save every last dime
I lied to my god, life is so hard
One of my most used excuses for me to just
Hold tools and live ruthless
Buying that pro tools was just useless
Dust collecting, wait a fucking second
I just cussed cuz check it
Even though I'm rapping, lot of blessings happen
It feel like I'm slapping even more than before
Am I disrespecting when I'm spitting this message?
Every time I can
Will my fans accept it? Should I even care?
Still second guessing when I know what's first
I'mma miss this blessing, man I'm just confessing
Yeah I'm out the hood, but everything ain't good

[Bridge]
There's so many, there's so many, there's so many
There's so many things that I could

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Be out here doing and knowing that I should
And if it's not getting done, I'm adding more wood
To the fire, I'mma burn in later, when I turn, the saviour
Gon be standing there like you would
Be in my kingdom, but I was singing
And your ears was ringing, you would feel that tingling
Kinda scratch it off and continue mingling
In a party drinking, all that unclean thinking, while it's blasting off
Your new record felt good now, didn't it?
You was on fire, now it's infinite
Man, I'm getting scared as I'm writing this
But I'm quiet in the flame as I'm spitting it
See this is my deliverance
For the first time I ain't only talking, I'm living it
No more laying down with women just
Lusting disgusting, trust me my faith is unlimited
No more posting and pivoting on blocks like I'm getting it
Countin dividends
Work up in the Timberlands, servin ‘em like Wimbleton, hurtin my community worse, every person I distributed
I attributed to they spirit givin in, so every time they sin again that’s another strike for me
Can’t believe that kind of livin was aight with me, man FUCK my life, they say life’s a B
Guess I was fuckin her too, no surprise to me, since I was handin out pipe for free
5-foot-3, nice physique, hop up in the ride with me and lean back in the driver’s seat
Every night with a stranger, but look how I changed up, I’m chillin on the road, got my wife with me
And my boobie’s smooth while all the groupies drooled, she just smilin and enjoyin this life with me
But see lyin to God has only lied to me, so Lord, them dopeboys still tied to me
I ain’t buyin ki’s but they’ll die for me and I’ll die for them, that feels right to me
If I’m wrong keep your scrawnies [?] and fight for me, I got a little bit of Christ in me
But I ain’t perfect, I feel that worship for your word as it grows inside of me
But I feel guilty cause though I feel it I don’t fully embrace it, man I just conceal it
'Til we all alone and then my knees get filthy as I drop before you like “Lord, you feel me?
You must think I’m silly, even I don’t feel me, ” feel like I’m actin while my conscience filming
Feel like my soul is sayin “Joell, really?” Feel like my soul is sayin “Joell, really?!"
There’s so many, there’s so many, there’s so many, there’s so many
Things I gotta fix for any of your joy really fulfills me
Forgive me Lord, man

[Outro: Sahlance]
Say yes, ohhhhh
Say yes, say yes
Say yes, ohhhhh
