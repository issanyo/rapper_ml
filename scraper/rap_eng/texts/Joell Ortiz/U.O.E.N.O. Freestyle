[Hook: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and U.O.E.N.O it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and U.O.E.N.O it
This a half a million dollar car, U.O.E.N.O it
I came up from bottom, U.O.E.N.O it
My niggas all ride with me on, U.O.E.N.O it
Got killers with me right now, U.O.E.N.O it
This a million dollar watch nigga, U.O.E.N.O it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, U.O.E.N.O it

[Verse: Joell Ortiz]
You did fucked around and stumbled on the wrong block
You ain't even know it
We blowing charvel with new jennies on cock
You ain't even know it
See them jewels man, they looking like dinner to the wolves
You ain't even know it
Man this thing about to get it, let me get another pull
She ain't even know it
You 'bout that live,, come up out that ice baby boy
I don't even wanna blow it
The hole from this ratchet, closing that casket baby boy
They don't even wanna show it
You already know it, so don't be heroic
Running I'mma throw it, around my neck
Show you how you supposed to do it
Cuz I know how to do it, you just looking stupid
You ain't even know it
Anyway these two-hundred dollar shots in my cup
You ain't even know it
Yeah I fold in this five, but I'm so in the cut
You ain't even know it
I got a snowbunny named Molly on champagne
You ain't even know it
I'mma take her home and enjoy that
But shawty gon' know that, Yaowa!
