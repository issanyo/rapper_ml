[Intro: sample (Joell Ortiz)]
If he had left here in a natural way (In a natural way, then what? Ha-ha)
I would feel better when I hear me, say (What?)
A good man is gone (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1]
A half a G and E&J out in the big park
When it got dark, we occasionally let the fifth bark
You was a hustler, I was a rhyme writer
You would serve customers, I would ignite cyphers
We rode around, try and get ass in a white Mazda
'til one day you just disappeared like my father (hey)
'Member you talkin 'bout that out-of-town dough, you was drunk
Most of the time I ain't think you'd be out, yo, you was drunk Most of the time I ain't think you'd be out, yo
Sure did, took your wife and your kid out to P-A
Right around my B-day, guess you had it mapped out
Always knew the crack route
Had them kids in that small town shook rollin dice with your gat out
I visited time to time, I had to check my dude
You had the hoes on a string, they always blessed the crew
A shotgun shell turned my man flesh to stew
Damn Jizz, we miss you
A good man is gone

[Chorus]
("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
Gone, a good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone")
Gone, gone, gone ("A good man is gone")

[Verse 2]
Uh, I met you at Sue's Rendezvous on a Tuesday
Flex spinnin, I see it like it was today
Block Royal emblem on your Polo tee
Handsome nigga, no homo B, you had that glow though see
I 'member you asked why I'm so low-key
With such a fire mixtape I need a promo V
You introduced me to the family, took it out to Jers'
Studio in the basement when I pronounce the words
Studio in the basement when I pronounce the words
I 'member you goin crazy, "Told you he get his flame on"
Right after that's when you introduced me to Akon
We 'posed to get a track that was nuts like acorns
Years since you gone I'm still getting my wait on
Anyway, your boy getting his fame on
Aftermath gang, got my Eminem and my Dre on
Still rep BR, know I carry the name on
Damn Screw, we miss you
A good man is gone

[Chorus]
("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone")
Gone, gone, gone ("A good man is gone")

[Post-Chorus]
This is for anyone who's ever took a loss
In bed, lights out, you just turn and you toss
It wasn't they turn, it wasn't they turn
Listen, we all got something to learn

[Verse 3]
Two things is certain, you live then you die
And I'ma do a lot of livin 'fore I get to the sky
'Fore I sit with that guy and repent for my sins
On my knees hands together and I pray to get in
On my knees hands together and I pray to get in
But until then (what) man I'm playin to win
I came in this game po', I'ma say YAY at the end
You ain't super duper nice don't be displayin' your pen
I'll expose it, none of your friends'll claim you again (who?)
Joell Ortiz is the name I defend
In the streets, on beats, on every stage I attend
I'm official! God forbid I'll die by that pistol
Say YAOWA, we miss you (word)
A good man is gone

[Chorus]
("A good man is gone, gone, gone") Gone
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone, gone, gone")
A good man is gone ("A good man is gone")
Gone, gone, gone ("A good man is gone")

[Post-Chorus]
This is for anyone who's ever took a loss
In bed, lights out, you just turn and you toss
It wasn't they turn, it wasn't they turn
Listen, we all got something to learn

[Outro]
A good man y'all, a good man is gone
I know you lost somebody
This is for you, and you, yeah
Keep 'em alive y'all, keep 'em alive y'all, keep 'em alive y'all...
Keep 'em alive y'all, keep 'em alive y'all, keep 'em alive y'all...
A good man is gone
