[Intro: CyHi The Prynce]
Yeah, it's yah boy CyHi The Prynce
Hystori 2.0
We got Slaughterhouse, Shady Records in the buildin'

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
Just ambulances, scoopin' up damages but the damage is never done
Niggas get left with pellets in their bellies
And stiffen trunks like elephants sniff
To debt is intent, let it be beef, I'd rather be peace
But if it's not, I'll be on top of many things but never the fence
Play offense, never defense, every cent
That I've made since I've been ballin' like I played in the playoffs
And the playoffs since
The seat under my fanned up physique never the bench
Karma catches everybody like the chicken pox
I have niggas wishin' they could just switch and get the shots
My kind of fly ain't landable
The dollars I got, they nothin' to me
I look at 'em like they my intangibles
Whenever they're gone I never miss 'em
I miss Maya Angelou
Triggers is poppin', niggas is droppin'
It's bigger than Biggie and Pac
As big as the Kennedy killings and we here to thicken the plot, nigga

[Hook: CyHi The Prynce]
Black leather, beret cap era
Guns at your capitol take it to that measure
It's Huey nigga, it's Huey nigga
Never been a victim or rebel against the system
Lames wanna diss 'em and women just wanna kiss 'em
It's Huey nigga, it's Huey nigga!

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Check me out, doe
Hands down, every time that my hand's down
On this paper, it's man down, for this paper, I ran 'round
Like a Major League ballplayer, pants down
Yeah I show my ass for this plate, crack, crabs and steak
From that Hatchback with Jake on my ass
Throwin' crack bags and weight through the glass
To this black Jag on 8's
From now on when I tweet, I'ma hashtag #TheGreat
Cause it was nothin' short of that, how my black ass escaped
From that hood, boy you hear that (oooh)
Somebody momma cryin'
They done pumped a boy full of iron, he dyin', I'm lyin'
Like I ain't seen nothin', I hug him inside that box
Where he lyin', tryin' to keep on survivin'
Shells flyin', I'm firin'
Partner I'm from down a block from Marcy
In the slums, get rich designin' coffins for the young
When "Cough Up A Lung" dropped I was regroupin' from 3 shootins
In my P's movin' P's nigga, Huey P. Newton

[Hook: CyHi The Prynce]
Black leather, beret cap era
Guns at your capitol take it to that measure
It's Huey nigga, it's Huey nigga
Never been a victim or rebel against the system
Lames wanna diss 'em and women just wanna kiss 'em
It's Huey nigga, (yeah!) it's Huey nigga!

[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Young god, OK
This when your arch-rivals send them sparks by you
I'm Stokely Carmichael with a large rifle
And it's shower posse's like your broad's bridal
When they reminisce over you, I will fall 'side you
Snuff in the glove, next to the car title
Insurance card and a small Bible
(Haha) My momma said, "As long as you got God by you
No weapon formed against me shall prosper"
The man who wrote that, momma, never held a yapper
Never been to Burger King, never smelled a Whopper
Never drove a box Chevy, CL or a Mazda
I'm just bein' frank and I did it like Sinatra
Went from pitchin' the broccoli, sawed off tip with the shottie
Get rid of the body, from where carryin' a pistol's a hobby
Traphouse full of trees like I was Mr. Miyagi
I'm Al Sharpton in the club, this a political party
Mothafucka

[Hook: CyHi The Prynce]
Black leather, beret cap era
Guns at your capitol take it to that measure
It's Huey nigga, it's Huey nigga
Never been a victim or rebel against the system
Lames wanna diss 'em and women just wanna kiss 'em
It's Huey nigga, it's Huey nigga!
