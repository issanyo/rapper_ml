[Verse One] [Eternia]:
Hey yo, figured this chick ridiculous a long time ago
The antidote to wack rappers like a Reef quote
Underfunded, well-groomed so fuck it
Threw a "motherfuckin" in there so y'all ignorant one's love it
But I
Speed it up for all the duly rap Kool G Rap lovin' cats
Imagine that, I could snap your neck back
Viciousness rip your head off like liquorice
You could come one come all, it's still effortless
I had a lot to prove and now I don't get up to throat
Choke on your own shit, you weaker than your own clique
So step to it, I could break you down like a therapist do it
You insecure, stupid
So say what you want or write your problems in a bottle
Throw em in the ocean like a corny Danielle Steel novel
Cause ain't nobody see you, I'm above sea level
I am an island that y'all cling to
Rap, could have left that shit alone but that's too easy
I see the way you eying me, taking me for a cheesy type
Chicken don't confuse me with your woman
Who play with many balls like a baseball mitten
Unforgiven that's a lesson you could learn the hard way
Like being sent to prison wrongly convicted of child rape
I hurt you, woman or man it's not personal
Learn the girl that birthed you, find her and reverse you, bye bye

[Verse Two] [Joell Ortiz]:
Rap messiah rapid fire at you tired-ass liars
Mastermind crack writer that inspires that biter
Don't want to sound like me, the underground OG
That'll go in the booth drunk from guzzling down OE
And paint the soberest picture for the world to see
Only thing on earth that's nicer than my girl is me
I know that I'm cocky dude but how could I not be rude?
I can't begin to try to count all the artists I probably chewed
And the broads y'all stress man I done had mommy nude
And I was butt-ass myself so we mashed like goppy goo
And the rest is a given, nah fuck that I'm a tell you
Man her neck was in rhythm then we sexed in the kitchen
Trying to tell you that's what you get when you're fresh with your spittin'
So in New York or not I'm still next to a pigeon
Hip hop fans better form a rescue division (why?)
Cause anybody gets down on my journey to the ground

[Verse Three] [Eternia]:
Your bitch ain't as nice as me cause I ain't a bitch
I'm that grown woman that bitches aspire to be
Their cats try to see on the low
They tell their chicks they're going to check a show
But it's me that they're checking for
Then they tell me that they don't want their wife
They want a life with a rapper chick
Grass is green and shit, that's why I'm celibate
Fought for the hell of it, I get bored I dip out
Your boyfriend text me when he get bored of you, you flip out
And act like you know but you ain't got shit on me
I roll with one army that's me, you can't harm me
Or what I live for: God, music, and family
All three out of reach bitch, please understand me
I'm Untouchable so don't be Sean Connery
My pops was a gangster, mother is God's property (true story)
That makes me something sort of special like an odyssey
What you think you got you don't got on me
