[Verse 1]
I'm not one of them dudes that you used to hearin'
I'm one of them dudes you gon' have to get used to fearin'
Cause just when y'all think my music nearin' it's peak
I dig deep and beat the song that was on last week
So ahead of my time - I can't wear a watch
In less than a second the minute and hour hand stops
Then the glass break, then the band pop
I'm a major-leaguer y'all pitchin' in the sand lot
I'm in a different division, you still spittin'?
I [cough] money 'till the whole crew sickens
You can't feel the raw I release from my tongue
I don't need a whole track, just a beat from a drum
I'm on my way to bein' the greatest of all time
Y'all remember what I said in the fourth line
If you don't, push rewind, take a second look
I'm off the hook, did somebody say hook?

[Hook] x2
I mean business - I ain't here to play no games
I mean business - I'm far from the same old same
I mean business - You could learn a thing or two from me
I mean business - I'm everything I work hard to be

[Verse 2]
It's Ortiz, ball please, you ain't ready, listen
I'm so focused, my flow 20/20 vision
I'm a problem, no way you could solve him
Just try to involve him in everything and be awesome
Since a lil' dude I knew I was a star
My mind gleamed like the high-beams on your car
I'm so not regular - I'm young, I'm smart, I'm nice
I'm handsome, I'm cool; etcetera, etcetera
I mean you know when you know you have it
That's how I feel 'bout my vocal habits
I'm the total package
No more, no less, no in-betweeen
I'm a --- myself, I don't need a team
Only child, no brother, no sis
Just to hang on the wall sock-ball all swish
That's how I came up, now I done came up
Flow flame Joe name gon' change the game up

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
That's word to my loved ones the boy is chosen
I was put here to make sure my noise is spoken
My flow is as smooth as and oil and lotion
Y'all dude's full of it - Okay
My thoughts come easy, it's hard to not joke about it
When I'm in the booth it's nothin' but hope around it
You know why, Ortiz is fire
Scrub, do yourself a favor and please retire

[Hook] x2
