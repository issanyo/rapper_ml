[Verse]:
Y'all know what it is, my flow is the biz
So me and my lawyer often (shake)
Hands, after a check get cut
I'm the best you suck
Who wants to (shake)
Free of the music everyone's doin'
Just tryin' to make a booty (shake)
I'm raw as a brick that's never been hit
You dudes be spittin' like the (shake)
When I hear a beat, my head to my feet
Just start to tremblin' and I (shake)
The pen until all that ink is gone
I think it's wrong the way I (shake)
The shit outta rappers, wasn't a bragger
But y'all sweeter than a (shake)
With cookies and cake, you rookies is fake
I'm lookin' to take the game and (shake)
It upside and grab all of the gwap that drops
I'm hot you not, let's (shake)
And really agree you'll never be me
"I love Ortiz", okay let's (shake)
The bottle you drink, let everything sink
So we can see what drugs you (take)
Ha ha, that's crazy, I just let me head (shake)
In disbelief the shit you speak and sick, you weak
You got the (shake)
Sssss
With an S at the end
I'm twisted again now (shake)
What your momma gave ya
While I'm behind ya till you (shake)
Then I'll take the condom off, my cock is soft
Come give it a (shake)
Now give it a kiss until it gets stiff
It's round two, the bed will (shake)
Like ba bumb ba bumb ba bumb eeh eeh ba bumb
Until it (break)
C'mon, who rhymes this ill?
Give me a (break)
My bad I should've said (take)
But when you nice I guess you (make)
It do what it do, it's beautiful
I feel the building (shake)
When I walk in with my goons
And dap the DJ like "What's (shake)in'?"
And the baddest broads go extra hard to (shake)
That's when I throw ice in the cup and fill the bitch up
And give it a (shake)
Cause after that I choose the bitch that gets to pet the snake
Haha
