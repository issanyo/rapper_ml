[Intro]
Joell Ortiz
Moss, what it do, baby
You know what we do
Who me?
Check

[Verse 1]
I don’t really need no introductions
Fuck it though, I’m Ortiz and I’m disgustin'
Need to be rushed in your nearest hospital and plugged in
Monitors pumped then electrocuted my function
And vital signs looks quite aligned when I write a rhyme
I define fine art
Murder you by design
I’m terminal, I recline in my death bed hear the track again
Got dragged in and then dig deep for this drift
The little plastic pin trickle down my thoughts
I pissed down your pores just pore like the nigga that
Dribbles down the court I appoint myself
In a world that is melting of metal makes the smallest nigga
Feels like the hell seen the devil from hell sees
Karaoke in my projects hearing high notes and niggers
Moms high with them objects
Look down to her son and shut down his lungs
Gotta watch you walk up to your up towns and guns

[Hook]
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Down down they don’t want to be bad
They just want what they don’t have
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Really want to be good
Then they would have stayed good
But they hood now

[Verse 2]
If you getting ships make sure you hit this
Because all you do is get high and talk positive
But they hypocrites no that they running a drill
They got a little bit so when they
So when they always pay to the cause they don’t give a shit
I’m a product of that violating and I’ll go back
Find me on your block with a chopper
Like its your time from match
But fuck the cannons my hand are animal laundromats
Watch a dag of junk metals anyone want a scrap
I don’t think so and it’s as far as this ink go yea
I want to see my American power my link goes
I control how them ships go no point go
I think my number just got called bingo
I got my foot in wraps ask where the things grown
Told me whatever your else speaks domingo
True niggers real spitter in the house
But that just when the grass interferes with this cash
And I blast

[Hook]
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Down down they don’t want to be bad
They just want what they don’t have
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Really want to be good
Then they would have stayed good
But they hood now

[Verse 3]
I know you hardly ever heard me angry
I’m just having a moment can you blame me
My memory full of regrets this evening
My life’s looking like the next this season
Lot of losses I frequent in that cemetery
Lost of homies march when It’s in february
Lost my granny in october I’m not sober
And on that booze bottle I’m knocked over
This music keeps my sanity in tact
I doubt it I’m depressed and
I’m having panicking attacks
I’m like a drum and piano when I snap
When that hundred cash flow
I’m danage on a track
Seen a couple greens when I’m standing in the back
Did a show in north shore a couple of dominicans in black
Fans Screaming my name like I’m the saviour
Its coming through if ya’ll don’t get in my way
I’m on my best behaviour

[Hook]
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Down down they don’t want to be bad
They just want what they don’t have
See everything you see where I come from
These little kids will lay you down
Really want to be good
Then they would have stayed good
But they hood now
