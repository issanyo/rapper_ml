[Intro]
I don't need the cheers from the crowd
To make me feel big, to make me stand proud

[Verse 1]
I ain't trying to make you feel sorry
Or burden y'all with the strugglin' story of me and my mommy
I'm just talking, so pardon me
I'm my personal therapeutic session
Lugging that trumpet to music lessons but never tootin' my own horn
The clothes that I threw on was wrong
Shoes worn, pants short, shirt too long, come on
Enough of the jokes, ain't I ya boy? Then why y'all clownin' on me
You don't see the girls laughing at me, why y'all wildin' on me
Sounds cliche but my life was rough
I hated when moms told me to walk ahead cuz that means she was behind me buying that stuff
Fast forward, I'm supplying that stuff, dodging the iron cuffs
Mask over my face like "open the safe or I will bust"
But that's over, God shined his light
Every rhyme I write is for my homies behind the wall that's forced to fly a kite
For my homies not here at all, up in the sky with night
Steppin' through heaven, reppin', they checkin' my thoughts when I cry at night
Damn

[Hook]
I don't need no cheers from the crowd
To make me feel bigger, to make me stand out, out
Cuz you see all the people that's with me
But I'm for my city, and I make it feel proud, proud

[Verse 2]
I do this for more than me, many people surround my story
I'm like a toddler's fingers man, everyone's countin' on me
It's cool though cuz I already made it if you look back
To the dark times, I took that to Tina crib and shook that
Mayonnaise jar with baking soda in there as it cooked crack
Gave away all them samples like people who clear a good track
Out in front of 340, .40 tucked in the leather
While I guzzle the 40 ounce yelling "40 I 5 and better"
Fast forward, the finest leather seats recline
I let the roof down despite the weather, still chilly, I'm hype
I never thought things that I write would get my puzzled life together
This talent, it bailed me out, been in trouble for like forever
So trust me man, I'm no better than you
I'm just extra clever, words sever every letter my competitors spew
And I'm thankful that God showed me what I was destined to do
I rescued my family and I'm going back for the rest of my crew
My word

[Hook]

[Bridge (x2)]
The streets already know
Ridin' through my city so they with me yo
Don't say I don't put on
Don't say I don't put on

[Verse 3]
Man I look from off these stages amazed at how many came
And the screaming, the yelling, heads that be nodding, hands that be raised
It wasn't long ago I stood on them corners with wrinkled pages
In my back pocket, flaming a cypher until they gave in
Like "imagine if this rappin' shit happen"
Like "yo imagine if this rappin' shit happen"
Just the other day I was dreamin' my condo looked at Manhattan
Pinched myself and not a damn thing happened
Haha

[Hook]
