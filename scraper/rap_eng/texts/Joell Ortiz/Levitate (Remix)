[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
You know I keep my eyes wide, East side fly guy
Flatbush tye-die, purple label, bow tie
Shoot straight, cross eye, gold gun, golden eye
See police, slow the ride
I had a bitch with the flyest fabrics, I broke her heart
Used to call me Escobar, skin fade, waves with the part
We dressed alike but our mind was on different levels
I drove her crazy till the chain broke, switching gears
Foot on the pedal, I'm going forward, fuck outta here
I blow a kiss and I got her, I never have to stare
Who using stairs? This that escalator style
Spit hot lines, I charge a fee when you start to dial up
You niggas boo boo, band aid when you got a cut
I got a scar face, forever feeling tough
My heart pump bravado since Eddie Jones, Cedric Ceballos
Before Kobe went to LA and was popping bottles
For real, homie, from the twenty-one two
I'm with the realest of real, so what the fuck you gonna do?
Before I leave, 100 Keep It to the Gs
Who come home with jail IDs and state greens
Like "what," nigga

[Hook: Nitty Scott]
Sometimes you gotta levitate up out your situation
Levitate

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I made some really poor decisions, a youngin lost, a system
That strongly forced division amongst us all was winning
Made a brother switch sports from basketball to pitchin'
Not baseball, just base, tryna ball off of them hittin'
Crack right in that glass pipe, I was on some mission
From hand to handing it all, to phone calls, commissions
Then one shot unclouded all my vision
My cousin gone, I miss him, they did him around my way
To this day, feel like I'm paying the true cost of livin'
It's my fault they hit him, I pray the Lord is wit' him
And when it rains it pours, Feds came storming in
And I escaped indictment but my boys all in prison
I was left with this pen in my hand, telling my damn story
Feeling it's a way to repent and get the past off me
So I scribble in this pad softly
Knowing there's a reason I got one more shot, demand glory

[Hook: Nitty Scott]
Sometimes you gotta levitate through it
Levitate through it, let it take you and levitate you

[Outro: Bodega Bamz]
Yo, you know niggas levitate like that
Like Chris Angel and that David Blaine nigga, but
That real shit that real niggas feel, you feel me though, pa?
