[Intro: Skyzoo]
We just wanted to live
They told us that countin' up somethin'
Seems the only way you can live
Swear to God we just wanted to live
They told us that countin' up somethin'
Seems the only way you can live

[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
In love with a mattress that was somewhat outta place
Where due to old habits it can double as a Chase
Talkin' major key, let it cut you out a case
And tryna run the city 'til it run you outta state
Told us all of this is straight, and it's worth what you wait on
Starin' at the exit like "yo I ain't tryna stay long"
Kitchen table decorator situate a plate on
Je≈õus, heavy is the head the crown lay on
But all of this straight
Runnin' outta state is what you play for and stay for
To turn to what you leave for, get your 16 on
Like talkin' mic check, throw the beat on
Or talkin' 'bout a key but being 20 OZ short
16 ain't enough, Andre features
As quick as you can be on, you'll be gone
Waiting on a detour, couple U-turns to where you belong
At best you can get your sight see on

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Just need a couple dollars
A couple dollars baby
Bet you I can plug 'em
Til the wallet dropping babies
Just need a couple dollars
A couple dollars baby
Told if I can get 'em
All of them will save me
Saved in a drop top BM
Right side, DM
All praise due up
Tell him when I see him
Started with a couple dollars baby
Was told if I can get 'em
All of them will save me
It's off a couple dollars

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
And it sounds like beautiful like the truth
Like "she bad but even more beautiful in the coupe"
And seeing that was seeing all that I would need to pursue
The e-class that was used to corner me off the stoop
Was as clean as the book that your hand on
When you prayed that we stayed away from them anthems
Fuck is left for us except for us to go stand on
A box with a rope and a bottle of Spade
Carpe diem, carpe diem, make it pop it for the day
I threw money to jeweler, sneaker box full of change
Know me, I'm no better I'm about it the same
Cause on a box with a rope is how we got in this frame
Now flick it up, one time for 'em, one time for 'em
Know it's lit if they in here with the 9 on 'em
One time for em, one time for em
And the parades lining up along the side for 'em

[Hook: Skyzoo]
Just need a couple dollars
A couple dollars baby
Bet you I can plug 'em
Til the wallet dropping babies
Just need a couple dollars
A couple dollars baby
Told if I can get 'em
All of them will save me
Saved in a drop top BM
Right side, DM
All praise due up
Tell him when I see him
Started with a couple dollars baby
Was told if I can get 'em
All of them will save me
It's off a couple dollars

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
As a youngin', had a lot on my plate
I ain't finna complain, just had a lot on my plate
Razors, 12 12 skinnies and 58s
I cooked a 6 deuce and came back with 58
I ain't stressin', I ain't stretch it, I just cheffed it in the butter
Orville Redenbacher, had it poppin', word to mother
Swervin' under covers, had it local, had it OT
Whippin' up P-O-T tryna get to the T-O-P
Get in and get out, that's always the plan
But all of them bands to a kid in the project who had nothin', so damned
Hard to let go from starvin' stomach, hollow with the echo
To the hardest Marc Ecko extra large retro
MJs before they dropped, but a lot started to drop
Stick up kids got the drop, my sneaker box dropped
Dropped crack, switched to diesel when some fiends dropped
Feds eavesdroppin'' on my drop, got 'em street blocked
They dropped by my man's spot so now he locked
I drop to both knees prayin' dimes don't get dropped
Dropped it all, be the bird locked in the coupe
Or take your talent more serious and lock in that booth
I chose the latter, and thank God for showin' Joe the ladder
Helped me climb through these rhymes
Who said I would never matter?
Look at me, such a hard act to follow
Lookin' forward to tomorrow, you'll never hear me holler
