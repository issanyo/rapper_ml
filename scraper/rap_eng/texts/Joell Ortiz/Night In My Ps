[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
(YAOWA)
A night in my Ps
Three fiends teamin' up to get one hit
Little dude on the roof tryin' test how his gun spit
Hennessy cups spillin' wildin' out to Big Pun shit
Dice game in the lobby, homey bank is a hundred
Shorty keep walkin' by wanna suck on my son dick
It's sad (why) that's word to me this ho is a young bitch
Cops ridin' slow if they hop out we run quick
Slam a door in they face and just laugh at them dumb pricks
Haze in the air, the smell stays in your hair
Hustlers on the strip wearin' yesterdays gear
Dressed in all black on a bike, he's a robber
Hood rats with they seed pointin', like he's your father
Undercover druggies tryin' to sneak a cop
Man get the fuck outta here man, that shit Meeka pops?
I just thought he smoked weed a lot
Dog be careful where your v is parked
That nigga there'll sneak thieve your drop
Son on the court tryin' to work on his jump shot
It's funny this is all on one block
Jamal and them locked, the cab had they face on cam, dirty
I know they sick doin' a bid for a buck thirty
You see that nigga right there? Yeah with the Bucs jersey
I got word on the low that son bucked Percy
These surroundings make it hard for yall to un-earth me
I shall remain Ortiz, this is a night in my Ps, nigga

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
They say where I'm from, stars are born
The bloods is strong, and uh
Crips is thick, the guns is long
And my P's are sick, it's outta control nigga
The block is hot, the guns explode
And the hood is psycho, you already know
They leave holes in your Girbauds
When it come to that dough
Cuz its all about that money, murder, and ho's
Yo here's an example when a nigga come home
First he, come out the slammer
Then he, pull up with bama?
Then he cock the hammers, and the drama is on
Won't be long for you know that niggas gone, doing bids
Leavin his bitch with another kid
It is what it is
I love the hood, grimy as shit
Down to the rocks I chop and  chicks that I rip
Runnin from the d's, makin cheese, puffin piff
To that whip I pimp and the yak that I sip
If you a G from the p's then you fuckin with this
Keep a bitch on her knees, and a gun on her hip
With 1 and a half and 16 in the clip
And every nigga who spit rep the hood they with
I'm reppin QB nigga, you know what it is
M.O.B. motherfucka, we reppin' the bridge
And wherever your hood is, throw it up kid
Get that guap and don't stop, handle your biz
