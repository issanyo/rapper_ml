[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I can do this all day
Y'all playing with it
Nuttin like J
OE and 2 Ls I'm lit
Who nailed ya bitch?
Me
Even bought her some new nails and shit
Carwash just detailed the whip
I ain't answering emails for shit
Nah baby I came out to play
In that new I8 out the way
E Drive don't make sounds a lot
I'm feeling the hate now but stop
Stash boxed this trey pound I copped
Spin around and lay down ya block
I’m a rapping dope boy so chill
All my niggas is doughboys for real
No Cubas to hop out the car
Just shooters that hop out like raaahahhh

[Hook]
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
Champ is here
Now I'm getting lit
Chicks in front of me
Lights on
Camera shy
Lost boy
Rubbing checks
Shorty drop it low
For this money, money
Show me what you mean
If you really love me
Niggas do whatever
For the cudi cudi
Straight out the ghetto
Where it's pretty ugly
You the one I'm liking
I need the reason
Cause everybody had you
Like the season
Tryna grow old with a pretty flower
Like a little cold
With a little lava
Hot hot
You know I like it baby
Hot hot
You know I like it baby
Ratatatat
Ratatatat
When she throw it back
Make her ass clap
They way you break hearts
Get your ass cap
Songwriters, composers, and publishers
All love her her
Her sex is a leathal weapon
I might Danny Glover
Like Gary Payton
No rubber
Ima smooth mothafucka

[Hook]
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
I make the trigga go, rahh rahh
Okay, I reloaded
G Class, snatchin’ ya pass, I revoke it
Rat, tat, banging dem baskets free throw it
If it make ya back ya ass up, chances we wrote it
Her back half lookin a tad bad
She bomber than Baghdad
The brain got her passing her math class
She know her worth and she add tax
Smokin’ fatties with a baddie, I don’t pass that
This shit remind me of Bikins of Wakiki
I'm feeding kiwi to my bitches in a teepee
I don’t know why you keep suckin on pee pee
You niggas couldn’t be me with a personal genie
Indigenious, digital bitch
I ain’t afraid to let ya know when I’m a diggin bitch
Santeria from my Tia, they sniffin a witch
Shake her hips and have a nigga all gripping his shit
That’s what the jungle do
This is animal behavior on the jungle juice
We just burn a lotta tree, know a truck or two
Try to move in on the tribe
Niggas come for you

Rahh rahh rahh
Rahh rahh rahh
