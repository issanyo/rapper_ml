[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
(Pay attention yo)
I'm a real dude, so let me let y'all know something
Always be the first one riding, never hit Joe frontin'
But see I'm not a yes-man, I keep a "no" button
So don't ever question my loyalty 'cuz of Joe Budden
I'm real to myself fight for what I believe is right
Regardless of what bloggers blog, or what these people write
Slaughterhouse, and my known involvement affects the movement
But we spoke, they respected it and I kept it moving
I ain't a troublemaker, I'm a gutter-hater
Wanna move my mother out these projects into something major
I want my son to see a world that I ain't never saw
I want my man to pick up a check instead of raw
As far as Benzino, I ain't know son
My man said "he used to own The Source", I said "ohh, son"
He ain't gotta like my flow son
That's his opinion
But my niggas get pumped when niggas show guns
(His man: But also chips)

[Hook: Novel]
If you know, like I know
There's gonna be hard times
If you go, wherever I go
Trouble may follow
Help me lord, save my soul
Before it gets good, it's gonna get bad
Gotta get these devils off my back

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
"Now tell me why I gotta come home and the crib dirty looking
I don't wanna eat out no mo', girl where the home cooking?
I snatched you out the projects, I don't ask for much
Why them dishes still in the sink? That's stuff we had for lunch
The other day
My mother says I should leave you
My friends say I should leave you
I'm arguing with these people
My reasons is getting weak, boo
They killing me, help me keep you here
No, they're not tryna be foul, it's just these people care
When I come home in the AM, I get the evil-stare
No I wasn't cheating, I was rapping, aight?
You know, the shit that pay the bills, keep you chatting at night
With your thumb on that remote, turning to channels you like
On that big-ass flat-screen with the ambient lights
Reflecting off the wood floors you never had in your life
Do you know how many girls would love to be in your shoes?
Fry some chicken, sweep the kitchen, that's the least you could do"
(Come on girl)
