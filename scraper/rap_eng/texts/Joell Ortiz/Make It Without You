[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Rest in peace Grandma
I'll always love you
Your grandson
Joell Ortiz

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Where you going?
Why'd you leave me?
My heart is broken
Eyes is teary
My head is aching
Chest is wheezing
I feel so empty
You left's the reason
I need air, something fresh to breathe in
Forgot my jacket, my neck is freezing
Man I'm so tired, ain't slept this weekend
The fans together, doing separate grieving
Dear Lord I'm upset this evening
My stomach rebels, won't accept the eating
"Sorry Joell" on every text I'm reading
They trying to help, but it ain't stress relieving
You the best at the lesson teaching
And I let you down before so I guess we even
You took my Grandmoms may she rest in peace and
Crying's all I can do, but I know she up there wit you
So

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
I’m gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I’m gonna find a way to make it without you
I’m gonna hold on to the times that we had
Tonight, I’m gonna find a way to make it without you

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I pour a little out, then commence the drinking
My eyes get blurry, when I get to thinking
Bout that long ride in that Limo Lincoln
Through the cemetery, and your casket sinking
You gone but it still ain't sink in
I walk past your room and I still just peek in
Hoping you reading or
Hoping you sleeping or
Hoping you eating or
Hoping you breathing or
Just hoping, it's sad I gotta hope
Best part of my birthday, Grandma envelope
Best part of my punishment, Grandma would say no
He coming out with me Michelle, go and grab his coat
She cried when I signed to Aftermath, that was dope
And hung every magazine that ever had a quote
I quit a while ago but I think I'll have a smoke
Crying's all I can do, but I know she up there wit you
So

[Hook: Alicia Keys]

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
My moms is mourning
Tried my best to try to keep her calm this morning
But her moms is gone and
That's all she had besides me and my sons
Her dad was 39 when he passed, he died young
Trying to make it through without Grams
I really can't believe I'm writing this right now damn
My youngest son's sad but he don't really understand
My oldest one cried on the phone, my voice held his hands
I'm sorry I couldn't see with all the tears
It's hard to let go someone you been with all these years
Grandmom I hold up that a wall for you I swear
Aight freak freak I can't do this shit no more
We gotta stop this shit now

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
