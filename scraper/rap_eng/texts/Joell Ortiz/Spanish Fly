[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Dope in my palm, yeah, hands is high
Everybody give it up for the handsome guy
Pimp juice on amplify
Fly my Spanish women in for some Spanish fly
Body suit painted, let me vandalize
Go on, give this spray tan a try
At the Tropicana high with the tiger in my eye
Just ordered some pizza up, come and live the Life of Pi
He say, she say, me no play that
Me say DJ please hit playback
Cause she say she may chill just stay back
And let her friends go, tell me take that....
Got them pocket aces, baby, and I'm all in
So don't fold now, let it all in
Bass bumping and the speakers rocking
Looked around the room, I got at least 3 options

[Verse 2: Bodega Bamz]
I was uptown in Post ave posted
Dominicana with the red heels smoking
She like it hard and she know I'm not a novice
My grammar bad but you know my pockets swollen
Mira mujerona Dame un segundo
Cayate la boca y dame es culo
Chicka un perrita mi nombre es cujo
Te gusta un sucio
Te gusta un sucio
Ima heart breaker shorty wasn't fond of playas
1st nut raw maybe use the condom later
In Miami getting jiggy with it
Silly with it
5 thousand for her booty did titties with it
Know you like when I'm naughty
She like yo “PAPI I'm horny”
I gotta crib couple stories
Make a movie record me
She like
"Dame papi chu"
I'm like
"Let's go to Peru"
First class with your church bag
Cuz I need offering
Papa dios calling
First class with your church bag
Cuz I need offering
Papa dios calling

[Verse 3: Nitty Scott]
Big hoops, hugging the stoop and that's Spanish fly
Make the medicine vanish and then I pacify
Fuck niggas, no lo quiero tampoco
Hit the kitchen, I'ma whip it like a Sancoho
You know I could make it wine to the basline
Throw it like a gang sign, this Butter Pecan taste fine
True, True, mira it's the crew
Hit my titi throw a hex, what the fuck you gonna do?
And I ain't bluffin
Nigga I got cousins
You know Latino multiply, like by the dozens
Catch that Mami linda, uptown and it's nothin'
With a baby on her hip while she cussin' out her husband
Who 'dat, blew 'dat, knew 'dat, too fat
Merengue with the Reggae
Nigga do that, do that
Never seen a Naturalista with the rich curls
I'm out the park and now they calling me Sosa
No I ain't fuckin' with her, she a Bochinchosa
I ain't nothing but a little mariposa
And if it be a problem you could lick 'dat chocha, nigga

[Outro]
Fresh cut, yeah, the handsome guy
For all my Spanish women in for some Spanish fly
Top down, keep your hands inside
For all my Spanish women in for some Spanish fly
Fresh cut, yeah, the handsome guy
For all my Spanish women in for some Spanish fly
Top down, keep your hands inside
For all my Spanish women in for some Spanish fly
