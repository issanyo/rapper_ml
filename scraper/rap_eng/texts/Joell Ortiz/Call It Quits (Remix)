[Intro: Apollo the Great]
Call it quits, none of you rappers are kickin it half as hard as this
Ca-Call it quits, none of you rappers are kickin it half as hard as this (2x)

See when I tell y'all niggas to call it quits I really mean that shit, man
Just in case y'all thought I was playin, I wouldn't got one of the nicest niggas in the game for reinforcements
Joell! Holla at em, man

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I hop out my bed, and pick up the lad, did you heard what this nigga just said
That's something that I hear often, when I stribble you dead, now hop on this year coffin
Look at my legs so muscular, for runnin that shit for so long, some of my spits is so wrong
They hopin I call it quits but I just blow on, giving my dick to blow on
Uncategorized a bull don't tryna sit me next to no one, this is mister shogun, every hits a homerun
Cheer for the underdog, the first thing at school, sneaker kicks where so wrong
Down he fell like a clown, no money around, he tried to pimp the old ones
Enough about the past though,.......the rest is coming up.......
