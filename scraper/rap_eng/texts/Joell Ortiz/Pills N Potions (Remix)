[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
The flyer kids used to laugh at me
Mom's tried her best, but we didn't have daddy
My grandmother, she just passed sadly
Couple childhood friends up in Coxsackie
Couple more catnapping under grass that be
Their spirit keeping this pen and this pad happy
They right there on them stages with me lit up
I ain't give up praying when them hates prayed I give up
Waiting for my spins on the radio to pick up
And that Nissan, Honda, Chevy low waiting on the pick-up
But nah I ain't quit, I'm nasty with the spit
Type you the shit and tag me cause I'm it
It happened in a flash, they flashin' me their tits
Flashlights pullin' me over cause I'm flashy with the whip
The wheels in motion, chill, I'm coastin', this is real devotion
I was in this booth while y'all was in these clubs on them

[Pre-Hook: Nicki Minaj]
Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook: Nicki Minaj] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful
Even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful
I told 'em it’s no friends in the game, you ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible that they love you
When really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on ‘em
I just reflect on 'em

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga’s life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now it’s kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy
I see the envy when I’m causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em
Cop cribs in the hills on ‘em

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we’ll be fine
In due time
