Y'all know who I is:
Marijuana Man!

[Verse 1]
Ok, I got the best pot in town
But before you get with me, boy
I want you to shop around
So when you come back this way
You know you dealing with that piff
I'm a king of the spliffs:
No ands, buts or ifs
It's them magazine-heads from down MIA
I got 5 G's a P, don't worry what I pay
Put your 20's in a bag
Slide your 50's in a jar
Niggas could move hundreds
If they hustled up to par
I drive a nice car off the strength of that plant
Just breaking up my bud'll have your fingers all damp
I'm 'ready treated like dope
And have my shit stamped
Call it, word to everything I love, all you need is one bud
To fuck up your camp
I'm on the grind all the time
Y'all be knowing my steez
Environmentalists be hating how
I'm moving them trees
But I can't stop, that pot keep
Knots in my pocket unless I get shot
Or knocked, y'all not gonna knock it
Who I is?

[Hook]
Marijuana man, high as a Marley man
20 in my right, nice philly in my other hand
I'm a hustle man, I'm just tryna double, man
Stack a couple hundred grand
Everybody puffing man

[Verse 2]
I got it all colors
What kind of smoking are you trying to do?
Looking for something sweet and smooth?
Right this way: I'll show you them blues
The best part about this - go ahead
And toss it on that scale
That this only a .7 - this bud is fluffy as hell
Want something a little stronger?
I got something that'll hurt you
Follow me over here - see that right there?
Yeah, that's that purple
The bud's a little tighter
And I'm sure you smell the fumes
It tastes just like it smells and that high?
It packs a peww.. this fella right here
He's both fluffy and he's right
His nickname is "Albino", he's a rhino
And he's white. I'd leave him in a jar
So they could see him and get hyped
Cause he's drenched in THC
Looks like a tree with Christmas lights
And last but not least: he's plain green
But he can push! Grand-daddy of them all
Look at his swoosh, they call this "Kush"
Now it costs a little more - but my oh my
Will this one go. And so there you have it bro
Last thing left is get this dough
Who I is?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can dabble with the other stuff
And make a lot of paper
But a couple guys I knew got hit with
Numbers like the Raiders
Real stand-up dudes, they ain't even
Mention a player, so I switched hustles
Cash ain't as fast, but it's much safer
I'm in and out of state
Without even half of the risk
A weed case is like a bracelet
Little slap on the wrist
But enough about getting locked
Cause ain't nobody getting caught
Everybody getting guap
The whole world smoking pot, baby!

[Hook]
