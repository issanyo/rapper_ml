[Scratch Hook]:
"You all know how the story goes!"
"I'm back"
"Ah yeah"
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"You all know how the story go!"

[Verse One] [Sheek Louch]:
This hip hop
Levi Denim, room in 'em
Who comin' back? I'm poppin' off as soon as you send 'em
Donnie
Half an ounce on that Ronnie, Bobby and Mike
New Edition, laid back, jewelry glisten
Shell toes
Classic, white on white
Stripes down my arm
Peace like Walaikum Salam
Iraqi, Ugandi, everything I make is the bomb
Pussy and money, the only thing that's keepin' me calm
Women love me, they follow everywhere that I go
Labels want me, they see the whole reality show
New York, New York, Flava and Chuck D's clock
Kool Herc, my man KRS and Scott La Rock
I'm a G
All y'all dudes know is Biggie and Pac
I'm a gangsta, you already know I'm holdin' the Glock
I done did little shows, arenas and tours
Y'all ain't hip hop, my rap collection bigger than yours

[Hook] [Sheek Louch]:
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"You all know how the story go!"

[Verse Two] [Joell Ortiz]:
It's hip hop
Romeo, Michigan, Kid Rock
Audio crack, Ortiz rap from a Ziplock
In the booth in my flip flops
Lips cocked, ready to clap anybody who feel they big shots
I just got, back from Europe, makin' this shit pop
Woke up hungover on a big yacht
Them Hungarian bitches know how to kiss cock
Had me pitchin' up like "Oh my God. Chick stop."
That's hip hop
And I love it
I get on any beat and trip like fly luggage
I'm a beast if you haven't noticed
And you about as scary as a bag of goldfish
In the streets, your boy's name is Loco
They can't see me, right now the radar's loco
Damn right I'm braggin' again
I'm nicer than those number runners with this pad and this pen

[Hook] [Sheek Louch]:
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"You all know how the story go!"

[Verse Three] [Termanology]:
I'm hip hop like Red and Meth jumpin' off the stage
Gazelle frames, Puma kicks, high top fades
It's Def Jam Donnie
Reppin' D-Block
And Puerto Rock Term reppin' S.T. dot
We that G. Rap, Kane, Kris language
The same shit Fresh Prince and them
Beyond Kid N' Play
House Party niggas that'll play Scrabble with the words
Got rowdy, bullet shatters, someone shit upon the curb
(Word?)
Then I'm coke with graffiti on the back
Strapped, pack under my black Adidas jack
I got, hoes and money
Enemies and cutties
And never dap a nigga up if he look funny
Good lookin' out
Louch, this easy to slay
I'm a Gang Starr, no Solar in the way
I got Notable Quotables
Body your man and do a show with you
That's why the punchlines fly over you

[Hook] [Sheek Louch]:
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
This hip hop
This hip hop
How get up out your seat and let this shit rock
"It ain't nothin' like hip hop music"
"You all know how the story go!"
