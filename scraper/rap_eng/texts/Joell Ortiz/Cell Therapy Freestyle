[Verse]:
Who's that peakin' in my window?
That's my nosey ass neighbors and they kinfolk
Tryin' to get some info
Hatin' on my Benzo
He can't be gettin' all these pretty things from just his pen yo
Man listen, you can't be serious this is pecanio
I'm tryin' to get that cheese like the old Jay Leno
I play an instrumental
And turn into the Loch Ness
They know I exist but can't see me boy, I got this
Tired of the gossip
The dropped from the Doc shit
I'm no longer on Aftermath ask me some Koch shit
You know, some Street Hop shit
The flows still toxic
So all that show doe it still goes in these pockets
I'm flier than a rocket
And if I was on one I'd be in the cut gettin' brizzle from a fly astronaut bitch
If I seem obnoxious...
Good motherfuckers cause I am
I could have folded but I called and that flop hit my hand
