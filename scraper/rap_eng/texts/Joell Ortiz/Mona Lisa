[Intro]
The beauty's in the flaws

[Verse 1]
I wipe the coal out of my eyes and let the light in
Look to the sky as I'm invitin' the sunshine
The lightnin', the rainfall, the downpour
The snow and how it whitens the whole ground
And somehow that brightens my whole day
Run away? No way, come right in
I'm one with all the elements
The benefits of writin' is I can remain here but go there
I'm flyin', I'm fallin', the parachute just opened
Look, I'm glidin', arrivin'
Thoughts heightened to the point I feel a slight wind
Goosebumps appear, you see 'em clearly on my light skin
Letters begin swarmin', words form and take shape
Without a warnin', I can feel my palms warmin'
And it's happenin' again
All that I'm imaginin' is transferrin' onto this pallet
As I scratch it with a pen
The first facet if a gem
The corresponding' scriptures start matchin' at the ends
It's soundin' like my soundbytes are at a ten
The tone in my headphones have grown to a frequency unknown
Some of us call this the zone
Every instrument is on they own, but not alone, it's like
We rent separate apartments in a harmonious home

[Break]
All I see is sounds, all I hear is colors
All I feel is nothin', it's a numbness like no other

[Verse 2]
Time is nonexistent, like forever in a moment
Wish this moment was forever but it's forever been just moments
I'm starin' at a canvas that was once blank
Contemplate, "if this was read aloud, then what would one think?
How would they perceive it?
Will everyone receive it in the light that I intended
Comprehendin' every meanin?
Or will they just breeze through it like a gentle summer evenin'?
Is this even worth leavin'?"
My easel, I flip the sheet and there's a
Brand new canvas waitin' for me, how convenient
Its eyebrow raisin' how I scrap a Mona Lisa

[Outro]
All I see is sounds, all I hear is colors
All I feel is nothin', it's a numbness like no other
The beauty's in the flaws
All I see is sounds, all I hear is colors
All I feel is nothin', it's a numbness like no other
The beauty's in the flaws
