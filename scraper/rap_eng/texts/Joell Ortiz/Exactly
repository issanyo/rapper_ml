Yeah you know who I be, violate and you E-I-D
When I’m in the B-U-L-C I ain’t in P-I-V
I’m on the dance floor me and my M-A-E-T
You know N-Y-L-K-Double O-R-B
We on that bullshit, stay in your E-C-A-L-P
Don’t D-O at the R-A-B
And be the only one left in the spot when the door E-S-O-L-C
Cause your L-R-I-G on my K-C-I-D
You shouldn’t have brought her anyway yous a D-R-I-B
Never bring sand to the fucking H-C-A-E-B
The hyenas’ll turn her to a Y-E-R-P
You blink to get a drink and shorty E-N-O-G
Right in the telly where she supposed to E-B
Baby girl hed game was outta this world like she dated T-E
Ya’ll motherfuckers is backwards in this E-M-A-G
That’s exactly why I spit this how I D-I-D, see?
