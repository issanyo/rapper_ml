[Verse]:
Lock your windows, close your mouth
I'm finna show the average Joe what a flows about
How 'bout I speed it up?
How 'bout I slow it down?
Maybe I say things twice twice, prove that I'm nice nice
Maybe I'll hold the word that's at the end
So you can say, "This boy done switched it up again."
Tell a friend to tell a friend that Joell is gone
And the rest of y'all should hang it up, like a telephone
I'm hazardous, my mic had to get a skull and bones
Cause I rock it and leave a toxic film after I tell a poem
I escaped the Terror Dome where shells get thrown to the ground
Out a metal chrome pound over who's sellin' stones
So don't ask me why I'm thorough on beats
Like a handicap groundhog your borough is weak
I'm a grown man, understand I don't play with boys
I'm just right for this website cause I'm makin' noise
Loud
