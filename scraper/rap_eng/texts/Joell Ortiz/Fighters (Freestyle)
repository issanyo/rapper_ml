[Sample from the film 'Almost Famous']:
William Miller: I've been doing some stuff for a local underground paper, too
Lester Bangs: What, are you like the star of your school?
William Miller: They hate me
Lester Bangs: You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle
Lester Bangs: You know your writing is damn good. It’s just a shame you missed out on rock’n roll. It’s over
William Miller: Over?
Lester Bangs: Over. Do you take drugs?
William Miller: No
Lester Bangs: Smart kid. I used to do speed. You know sometimes a little cough syrup. Stay up all night, writing and writing. And like 25 pages of drivel about the phases of Coltrain. You know, just to fuckin' write

[Chorus] [Novel]:
The fighters are all around
And the lovers are underground
No one will save you, anymore
So what's happening?
What you rappin' about?
Is it boys? Is it cars?
Is it girls? Is it money?
Save the world
The world

[Verse One] [Novel]:
Katrina tragedy, Jena 6
? trapped and rappers rich
Yeah we came from rags to this
So when we ever gon' get past this shit
Ain't tryin' to judge I'm the same as you
I feel pain and anguish too
I spit broken language too
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Gotta watch my back nowadays
Gotta look out for my own
Everywhere I go I roam, I know the government be tappin' my phones
Let's go against the man, let's stand out
Put a fist in the air, throw a hand out
Open your eyes son and revolutionize
Everybody choose sides, let's see what pans out

[Chorus] [Novel]:
The fighters are all around
And the lovers are underground
No one will save you, anymore
So what's happening?
What you rappin' about?
Is it boys? Is it cars?
Is it girls? Is it money?
Save the world
The world

[Verse Two] [Joell Ortiz]:
Who the best in the booth son
Got the Internet goin' crazy every time he give a website a new one
Who never mention that he shoot guns
Still gets the ooh/uzi and ahhs when everybody call him "New Pun"
Brooklyn, yeah I rep that
Champion hoodie with the Mets hat low
In case I'm in the hood and have a set back
And one of my man's got to step back and let that go
I'm gonna get that doe
I don't wanna be po' no mo'
That sucks when your pockets feel like they got hit by a Mack truck
So when they pull the track up, I don't just act up
I wild till the studio calls for back up
Opportunities something I never pass up
Yeah I'll do that, give me that, yup that too
That game's sick, you the man or you ain't shit
So I flame shit till my name stick like a tattoo
Achoo, I sneeze on the game till everybody's sick
Let everybody spit
Okay everybody done, I'mma have a little fun
3, 2, 1
Everybody shit on they self
You ain't never heard a flow like mine
Seen a show like mine
See hoes like mine
Let me know I'm fine
Yours are whores of course because your boring lines
Don't work with women, they work with little sluts
See a few bucks won't give a nigga a nut
Mine's got jobs and credit, they know the game
Put something in they name and I get a little butt
And maybe I'm wrong but the ladies I bone
Are rewards for not rhymin' my Mercedes on chrome
Or how your brain be all gone when the mag is out
Man I can't stand what y'all rappin' 'bout

[Chorus] [Novel]:
The fighters are all around
And the lovers are underground
No one will save you, anymore
So what's happening?
What you rappin' about?
Is it boys? Is it cars?
Is it girls? Is it money?
Save the world
The world
The fighters are all around
And the lovers are underground
No one will save you, anymore
So what's happening?
What you rappin' about?
Is it boys? Is it cars?
Is it girls? Is it money?
Save the world
The world
