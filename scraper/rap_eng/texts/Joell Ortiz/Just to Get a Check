A little kid just walking up the block
He sees a boombox with a crowd so he stops
Not too close though he sort of easedrops
Hears one kid say "I'm movin' all of these rocks"
And the next line rhymes with the line before
Then the next dude goes but the guy's a bore
That's when he realized that he's near a street cypher
So he ran across the street up the stairs and he's hyper
Finallyhe  finds a pen and a couple loose sheets
Writes his first sixteen to a Das EFX beat
It wasn't Smith & Wesson either way he was weak
But he ran back down spit his shit and it was deep
Not his rhyme 'cause that was filled with fifth shots
He was just amazed how they let a little kid rock
He been up stairs since now look his shit's hot
And that little kid's now a big boy in hip hop
Just to get a check
