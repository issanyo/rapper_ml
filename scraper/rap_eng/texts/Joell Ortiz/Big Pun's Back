Big Pun’s Back!
Big Pun’s Back!
Where all my Puerto Ricans at?
Wave your flags like that

[Verse 1 - Joell Ortiz]
Still not a player I am just here
Out here tryna crush if it’s phat
Dead in the middle of little Italy blowing her back
Now you can catch me in a cherry red 750 sippin’
On a nut cracker cruising with the semi with me
I seen this ho tryna stare
She said, “I know you I swear”
I said, “what you said your name was again?
And I know you from where?”
High school? Go thata way
Man I’m doing it, every night
Feel like a Saturday
You can’t ruin it cause
See the flow that I have put Joe’s in a bag
Like a toe with a tag
So I know why you mad
When I roll down the Ave.,
Real slow With a bad one making you guys at home look sad, but
Please don’t be like this other dude that was thinking dumb
He tried to snuff Joe, so the Puerto Rican rum
Opened him up put a cease to his fun
A couple right hooks put a leak on his gums
Reached back to the TS
Homie from the BX
But BK bees where I’m from

[Hook]
Big Pun’s Back!
Big Pun’s Back!
Where all my Puerto Ricans at?
Wave your flags like that
No need to worry to worry mi Boricuas
Yea your primo is back
Joell Ortiz the new Christopher Rios of rap
And thats a wrap!

[Verse 2]
16 but I'm not done
A few more strokes before I come
I am innocent in a lineup
In other words listen up niggas: I am not the one
Ol’ timer, new comer anybody Can get it
I'm so serious about these ones
This is how I feed my sons
So until the air leaves my lungs
Fee fi fo fum I’m a giant in the slum
Take cover when ya’ll hear me come
I’m colossal man, I squash you underneath my feet like gum
I rep the Rotten apple my squad will clap you
When they point that nozzle at you
It’ll heart attack you
Skippin’ on the beat like Pun
