You know a lot has changed nowadays
People don't make art no more
People don’t make music as if-as if it was a canvas
They don't even care no more
I remember when-when makin' music was like
Takin’ a stroke of the brush and creatin' somethin'
That would live on for years, that would last a lifetime
Maybe somethin' out there like a Mona Lisa
