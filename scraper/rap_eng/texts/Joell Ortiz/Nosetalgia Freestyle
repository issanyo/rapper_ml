[Verse]
They wanted me to rhyme on this
Who the fuck is your favorite rapper?
What is that he or she does that makes them a factor?
What did they do to earn your vote? You democrat or
Republican? It's all politicking
If I hear swagger one more time I might slit my own wrist with a rusty dagger
Fuck your ice, my flow cold as a polar's tongue in Alaska on a frozen tundra
I try my best to hold in tons of hate, I hope and wonder
Will it circle back to back when Hov was younger
When him and BIG was back to back on just who's flow is dumber
And Big Daddy Kane was sitting back like ''you know where they from, uh''
I'm just a 'rican from Brooklyn
You disrespect with indirects and believe me I'm hookin'
14, this shit is locked, y'all ain't leaving the bookin'
I'm leaving my book inside of the oven, y'all see what I'm cookin'
This how I'm feeling, yeah, this how I'm feeling, yeah
Joell wasn't heir to a million, but I'm a millionaire
Couple of shoeboxes in the ceiling near, the central air
The breeze feel like money while honey chill in her underwears, yeah
I fuck bitches in their hey', you fuck 'em when they okay
Wife'ing used to be bad bitches back in the day
You laying on the couch looking stressed
I just finished biceps, I'm about to do chest
Your checks bounce
I make niggas bounce, get a check then bounce
The dashboard look like a calculus test, I'm out
I ain't looking back, y'all back looking for who can rap
Cause rap looking like new niggas who swear to God they took it back
I was taken back, God, I swear these new niggas can't rap
I took steps back looking at these niggas, y'all aight, but fuck that
I'm out
With this pencil I go to war, soldier
Every order is for my core soldier
Radio make you sell your soul, give your heart away trying to cross over
But I keep it Tim Hardaway with the crossover
A.I in the street clothes with the cornrows
On the sideline like ''fuck guidelines''
Get on the court, hold up, wonder if anybody thinking
They better than the YAOWA cause I leave everybody stinking
Like they never took a shower, in the after-hour drinking
Smoking sour, who get soaked from dancing soca in Jamaica, listen
I'm rapping major, God bless the savior
It's funny how being in first became second nature
But even with the extra paper and success
I played the block with the Ciroc on the rocks in the 'jects with gangstas
Pusha T gave me a high five
Said it's cool meeting other rappers still able to go outside
After my ''Outta Control'' it went out of control
Kendrick we aight, just know I'm not getting out of this throne
And I ain't try to stir shit up
Just let y'all know it's all love, but I'm about to hurt shit up
I've been quietly loading clips, boy, I'm about to murk shit up
Crazy how I ain't hearing nothing, but feel like I heard enough
It's about to get bad, boy, word to Puff
Every verse is just a vet versus a verse and an evil vet versus a pup
I guess I'm vet in reverse cause I'll bark on you, doc
You hearing verses from a vet, your boy bad, let me stop
You stuffing a hundred bands in the ceiling
I just dropped a hundred bands on the ceiling
Soundproofing so the tenants won't hear the band when we illing
Downstairs in the studio, oh man, what a feeling
Y'all hoping that the times get better
Well, I got better with time, this shit is mine forever
