[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I heard the whispers, they thought that I was done before
They thought Dre said I was something he don't want no more
They thought I got dropped, they thought I would stop
I thought not, hopped out the square and thought out the box
Listen, I keep it real, I was hoping that the major work
But I was indie again, time for some major work
Already hungry, but the non-believers made it worse
Had me posting up in that booth like every day the 1st
Who was supposed to give up? Nah, not me
Man, post this shit up on Nah Right, B
Hello world, I'm a star, look what I invented
Rap radar identified what my spider senses
I had the hip-hop game on smash
And a title locked up, like Akon's smash
And then I linked with three dudes who also say y'all trash
With another chance to show you again
So I'm holding this pen

[Hook: Keely]
Bet never thought that you'd be back in this position
Got no answers for their questions
And it kills you just to listen
That you know
There's nowhere else left to go
And I ain't coming home
I ain't coming home

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
It started with assault charges, B&E’s, burglaries for keeps
And a dark back alley block in them Jersey city streets
Who knew, that I could prosper spittin' aca off of Hennessey vodka?
And dudes who were meant to be partners will mentally block ya
And paying with pennies ? from Denny's to Lobster
But your own actions is what could essentially stop ya
I come around and the track get nervous
If you wrote them off, then be able to track that purchase
Hooked up the IV, so ? that I be deceased in the near
My heated wrist feel on the reaper's ears, but he can't hear
If you're talking chain of command, I want to be clear
We're different links, how can an A-Lister and Z share
Rodman with the trash talk, Magic or Walt
With the black ball, way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
Move relentless through the rumors
And my mere presence says God's got a funny sense of humor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Bet you never thought that you'd be back in that position
I'm talking to you bitches, arch your back in that position
Your ratchet ass was missing, you thought that I fell off of Shady Aftermath musicians
Got me packing ammunition
I'm back, the circle gang boss
Witness the resurrection came 'cross
Jesus, name a vixen I can't toss
She use her mouth to clean my thing off
And I call it getting brainwashed
Slaughter's hotter than ever
To be hotter, you gotta cop a ? Prada ? leather
Walk in an executive's office and holler, "You better
Hit my pockets with cheddar
Feed me paper like my pockets are a document shredder"
You really thought I’d get this money and behave?
Niggas left me for dead, did the dougie on my grave
I'll break your purse for my perseverance
Them same labels getting raped for a verse of clearance (for real)

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
God's favorite, dark horse of the devil's family
I'm Plan A 'til it's my damned day, failure's my Plan B
From ashy to fancy, behind bars, to behind the bars
To made it, so I can fit an jail cell inside of my pantry
My daughter's a doll, she loves to see her father come
She loves to blow bubbles with her bubble gum
Now she lives inside of one, just accept it
Got Martin King's heart and Martin Sheen's son's blood, cuz missed me with your questions
I am the Martin Scorsese of this profession
That's why I'm outta here like Martin Lawrence said, get to stepping
And I did it doing the kind of music I like
You's a fool, you thought that "Boom" would be my only highlight
Slaughterhouse been outcast, first we're here, then we're there
Then we started to rhyme like we pretend to load our pens with lead
Now we moving on up like the Jeffersons
Cause things came full circle like the top of Sherman Hemsley's head

[Hook]
