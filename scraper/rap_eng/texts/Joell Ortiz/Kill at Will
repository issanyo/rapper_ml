[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
(Yoo) Wait a fucking minute
I don't think you know who in it to win it, I spit it definitive
Ripping every lyric, they spit it ridiculous
Listen this kid is very gifted like St. Nicholas, on the twenty fifth, let's get it nigga we on!
They gave me a Blood diamond, Sierra Leone
Make the beat rock Celine would be Dion
Pass in the zone when ET pointed home he tried ringing my phone in other words we gone
Worse every verse a curse I need a clone
'Less I'm in the mirror I feel like I'm so alone
Animals and mammals that channel my vocal tone, I'm the hannibal cleric so wanna bone, I'm a monster
Conquer rastas, living past the choppas redenbacher poppin til the top off
Your mouth comes apart like hot pasta, a mobster when I chomp penne alla Vodka
Sorry that I'm braggadocious, but what matters most is, rappers notice, I'm in combat
Fully on the pack of roaches, and the back of the stove Iâ€™m about to raid and spray it, they all flat
I don't think they know who they playing with, I don't think they know who they playing with
Had to say this shit twice, make sure I reiterated it, your career hated it, hand it up, Basquiat painted it
Who do you impress? Doing advanced of night checks in the cemetery, doing it to death
Move to the left, with your muscle shirt glued to your chest
News check, you're in school with a vet

[Hook: Big Daddy Kane]
I ill and kill at will, teach em' a skill that's real you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I bill
Science I drill until my rhymes fill, your head up
Cause I ill and kill at will, teaching a skill that's real you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I bill
Science I drill until my rhymes fill, your head up
Don't even get up, the teacher is teaching, so just shut up

[Pre Ad-lib: Token]
Shyea!

[Verse 2: Token]
Remember the time in the presence
Who enlightened the menace, who can rhyme like the best, with a co-sign from a legend
But when hiding your message with no sign of direction, but the eye is respected, in my eyes you're a peasant
Handing me nines like detention, like they sliding a debit because I will pretend this
And you sugarcoat your lyrics so much you gon make a diabetic die, die in bed, full of die embedded (wow)
Back off of this, mad artist will lack confidence
Mad obvious, cause he might be defensive
(Which means) he's hiding aggression, (which means) he's fighting himself, (which means) his time will be endless, (Ehhh, let's go)
Everybody talking like you perfected this some kind of a method
But I see crack on the back of your diamond embedded, it's not even a kind of impressive, I'm trying to get it because
You do everything he do because everybody loves him
But nobody gonna pay for two people doing one thing
So you might have views but you cancelled the ticket
(Damn man) better get it, (blam, blam) when I kill it, (and fans) will be flipping, (handstands) like a gymnast, (and) man in a minute, (grand) stands will be biggest, (grand) can any woman, (slam) stamp every lyric (Ayy!)
That's why they root me for real
You said that you've never failed
But right now our fresh writers you have gone stale
You caught red hand and you read with your hands like brail
Hell naw, you ain't near it
I'm the epitome, the peak, the apex, the pinnacle of critics
I'll enter lyric with every piece of grammar
You might meet Token, but you will not meet his standards

[Hook: Big Daddy Kane]
I ill and kill at will, teach em' a skill that's real you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I bill
Science I drill until my rhymes fill, your head up
Don't even get up, the teacher is teaching, so just shut up
