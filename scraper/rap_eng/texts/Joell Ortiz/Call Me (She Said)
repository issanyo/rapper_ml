(Aww man, ninety five) She had that perfume with the only smell
Hair scrungied up in a pony tail (woo)
Gold hoop earrings with her name of 'em
I had the colliseum fronts with the fangs on 'em (what)
Oh, Thinnest waist with the fat ass (damn)
Had me all happy to go to math class
Yeah, I had to go for it baby
Sent the letter over circle yes, no or maybe (remember that)
(Uh) And she looked back with a cool blush
Showin' me the results of a nice toothbrush
Yeah, we rode home on the same school bus
Confident consistent I'm crushin' these new Pumas (woo)
Yeah, and she told me she from the southside
Told her I'm from Cooper she looked at me with her mouth wide
Like, I got fam' out there
I gave her the number now you got a fan out there
Man I really hope this girl

Zipped the Haley Hanson out the do' good to go
She standin' there stretch pants fifty fo' elevens
Yellin' hurry up they want me in the crib before eleven
