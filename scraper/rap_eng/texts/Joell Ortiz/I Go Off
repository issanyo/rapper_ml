[Verse]:
So here's a quick lil' somethin' cause I feel like frontin'
Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with me so don't say nothin'
If you feel otherwise, please don't be subliminal
Sneak thieves ain't the same as a real live criminal
One nigga dissed me that's one too many
I ain't throwin' back shots like they from New Henny
I'mma punch you in your nose till your facet leaks
Blood e'rywhere like you double crossed a leech
Little man shut your mouth when the bosses speak
I am terminally ill, your little cough is weak
If you can't stand the sand then get off the beach
Your lil' jab will have a tag hangin' off your feet
(I'm the cavity)
If you think New York is sweet
(Defy gravity)
And jump like you lost your seat
(I'll fire rapidly)
And dump till I toss your Jeep
(You'll die in agony)
Slumped, parked across the street
Can't beat 'em then join 'em, you serious man?
I can't beat 'em I train til the day that I can
Failure ain't somethin' that I'm just finna
I'm such a sore loser I make sure I'm a mothafuckin' winner
I'm a bear, not a teddy that you cuddle in the winter
If I saw Goldie Locks she would have been mothafuckin' dinner
And this hip hop game got drug
So fresh off of the corner like A-Rod's glove
Comes me, salivating for a slice of livin'
When I look at rappers all I see is rice and chicken
I'm toxic, make the right decision
Just try to eat me, you get Poison like Michael Bivens
Not a snake though it sounds like I might be hissin'
That's just my tongue sizzlin' like Chinese kitchens
Ever feel like you runnin' out of shit to say?
Man that's fucked up cause I could do this shit all day
Every time my wrist switch I make your clique gourmet
Y'all niggas gotta get better like Chris Pauls' J
Just bein' honest I'm not a hater
But the number in my loss column, dials the operator
You niggas get the ball and fumble like hot potato
Every time I get the ball I score cause I'm a player
Every bitch me on my balls, I score cause I'm a player
Well not ever one, but I be havin' FUN!
Every night a different whore tells me "Mi amore"
I know she lyin' but I let her tell me more
Then stop her mid sentence and put her face in my drawers
Then tell her, "Keep Your Head Up" like Shakur in '94
And I usually don't brag about ass
But some of your future wifey's I fucked in my past
You rap and you spit, hit the gas and you split
And that whip is so sick how attractive you get
Don't let you hop out if your fashion ain't sick
Your hat matchin' yo' kicks, it's a wrap for this bitch
I'm just displayin' why they say I'm the best
Long as I'm here you #2 like you takin' a test
I'm here to put all the debating to rest
Firecrackers I'm the bomb like I'm a favorite of Flex
Ortiz over there, look at you breakin' your neck
To get a glimpse of the messiah, a glace at the champ
Raise your white flag higher or I won't cease fire
I'll lift your whole shop like Winonna Ryder
I'll sell anything when I approach a buyer
Audio crack jack, I'm a known supplier
I wish a nigga would try to knock my hustle
Put a leash on the beast, he gon' pop the muzzle
What good is puttin' shackles on a Frankenstein?
They can't restrain a creature that's 8'9"
With an extremely dangerous brain design
By a mad scientist with a tainted mind
A few years ago
A friend of mine
Died from a shotgun shell in his spine
I cried, they said, "Stop Joell", now I'm fine
But I'm not, I hear that shot every night when I recline
My man is gone
My cousin, gone
I can't stand death
Left tour for a week when my grandmoms left
Aww man I'm stressed
But I ain't gon' stop till they land my jet
And from there I'm stretch limo chauffeured to the Grammy's
And hold a couple up in front of all of my family
But the road in between gon' be some rough shit
It's like we interrupted by rappers that's disgusted
With me being on top, but throwin' shots from a musket?
Will blow up in your face cause that nozzle is rusted
But me?
I got a clean
Semi-auto machine with a beam that's able to split a bean
From two football fields away with four teams still playin'
Don't become the first down, kna'mean?
Just know business is something I mean
And anyone can get iced when it come to my cream
I don't like to talk I like to prove I'm wild
So here's a quick 88 on this tune/Toon like Al

[Outro] [Joell talking]:
Haha. You gotta be a Jets fan to understand that last line. If you not...fuck you nigga! Haha
