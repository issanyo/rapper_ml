I dominate break loops
I rock beats that's mega trifle

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I walked out my project building at the age of nine
With a piece of paper in my pocket with my favorite rhyme
Approaching the cypher like watch what I say this time
I gave thought to these bars now they ain't just lines
They ain't know what was going on in this brain of mine
Daddy jetted, that affected mommy's state of mind
Mommy habit graduated from just blazing vine
Now she running back and forth just exchanging dimes
She in her bedroom crying for his lame behind
I'm in my bedroom dying want to break his spine
Put my problems on paper gave my pain design
It was two things left to do, pray and cry
And I did both so when we toast I really taste the wine
When I eat a steak I straight 'til the plate get shined
I feel like karma gonna come around and take my gift
So I live in paranoia I gotta shake this shit

[Hook]
I gotta shake this, drop shit off me
He ain't get a release from the got shit off me
I-I gotta shake this hate shit off me
This fake shit off me
I'm beasting on these beasts little bitch get off me

I dominate break loops
I rock beats that's mega trifle
I dominate break loops
Giving mics menstrual cycles
I rock beats that's mega trifle
I rock beats that's mega trifle

[Verse 2: Scheme]
I'm trying to shake off every demon in my past
The voice of the malicious child is the most vicious
These hoes is fictitious
These vindictive good-for-nothing sons of bitches
Got me wishing I was cold hearted, look what you done started
I witnessed the coldest winters in the vacant heart, agree
Cordially think that this paper's all I need
Push the pain annihilate the monsters in these sheets
Ready talk but would unleash the beasts on any of these beats
Ay, speaking about, nickle and diming and kicking 'em out
Fuck every demon for thinking I'm weak
And then figuring I'd never figure it out
[?] foes and mimicking hoes
I'm wrecking heaven and [?] blows
Fight for the right despite what you might
Think, G shit is more what I know
Healthy when gotta thinking about it they never thought I would make it up out
I been the realest, a killer since dealers with figures was really just barely nickle and diming
Picking my time and never rewind, there ain't nothing better doing it now
I'm shaking off all the leaches and reaching for beaches and mansions to honor the power

[Hook]
I gotta shake this, drop shit off me
He ain't get a release from the got shit off me
I-I gotta shake this hate shit off me
This fake shit off me
I'm beasting on these beasts little bitch get off me
