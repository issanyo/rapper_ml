[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)
My mama worked double shifts, she had three jobs
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta go and hustle quick, I gotta be somethin'
(I ain’t never had nada)
I’m livin' uptown, I stay by that weed spot
(I ain’t never had nada)
I gotta upgrade to J’s from them Reeboks, brrrrr
(I ain’t never had nada)

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
My mama was single, my father, he left us with nada
Not even a dollar for diapers so she doubled her hospital shifts
Just to give us a quality life, uh, now I’m chasin' this money
I’m sick and tired of askin' what the price is
And I’mma need me a couple of millions for my sacrifices
Yeah, now the landlord called
Said he need a couple of G’s for the lease by the first
I live in the hood where they beef over turf
Yet them rich folks still wish them streets would be theirs
Now they just built another fuckin' Starbucks
But the corner store close, killin' our bucks
How we supposed to be a breadwinner
When we livin' off them little fuckin' crumbs that they toss us
It’s a tossup, wanna chalk us out
‘Cause we shoot each other up over Porsches
Lil’ mama like a pro, pro-choice
'Cause her man just endorsed her for gettin' an abortion
I wish it was different, it isn’t, we livin' with drama
All the homies doin' anything to eat right now 'cause we never had nada

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz]
Cheeseburgers, fries and Coke, my mama worked in White Castle
I ain’t never had nada
She used to sniff lines of coke, enough to build a white castle
I ain’t never had nada
We ain’t had a dime, we broke while I’m dealin' with life’s hassles
I ain’t never had nada
Man, niggas had all kinds of jokes but this is right back at you
Just when y'all thought it was a wrap, I thought of a couple of raps
Took the money from the trap, hit the booth on ‘em
Said let me give this a crack, I’m tired of slingin' that crack
I started spittin' this crack and it grew on ‘em
First bookin' was a wrap, word to Brooklyn, it was packed
Man, it happened in a snap how I blew on ‘em
Had the haters face blue on ‘em, watch face blew on ‘em
Bitches blew on ‘em, niggas tried to race the whip
And I blew on ‘em, shit fast dude
Remember that fast food fiend, well she clean now
Floor model gone, flat screen now
Livin' in the condo of her dreams now
Bank cards, no more EBT now
We chillin’ on a little somethin' partner
Money meetings and button up Prada
But you’ll never see me frontin’, I’mma stunt
And I remember when I never had nada
