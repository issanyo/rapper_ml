[Verse 1: Alex Fitts of The Kickdrums]
Tell me my friend, have they gotten to you?
Have they gotten inside your head?
Into the world trying to face existence
Will they remember us? Here we are hesitant in speech, lost
Just trying to let him know it’s all a joke
You shouldn’t take that serious or else you might crack up

[Hook]
But hail to the thief, he’s getting away again
The world wants its fees, might be you and me in the end
While one wants to believe, another one wants it to burn
It’s just a game, it’s all a game, it’s just a game

[Break: Joell Ortiz]
Clap, if y'all listen closely, y'all hear me clapping live in the booth
Those are claps of joy, know what I'm saying?
They said we couldn't make it, look at us though

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I was young but wasn't dumb ma, I knew the deal
But I swear to everything, I ain't mad at you for real
You was getting high but you tried to keep your bull nill
And look, I won't conch again another music deal
But on the low, you ain't know I was pursuing pills
I was on that block flying and still moving crills
I know you hear this, you probably gonna be disappointed
But this the Devil kingdom, God, let 'em get appointed
He tripped, had me chasing a little bit of joyment
And had my liver fiending for all that liquor ointment
Well I still fiend for that, I gotta have a sip
Helps me escape reality and break the baddest bitch
Remember being in the store, stealing a bag of chips
A little nigga stomach was growling but I ain't have a grip
Y'all can say I relate but y'all don't know the half of it
Saying I was poor is about accurate, ah man

[Outro: Alex Fitts]
It’s just a game, it’s just a game, it’s just a game
