[Intro]
Monsters in my head
Monsters in my head

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
What if I told you I wake up screamin’ and swingin’
Dreamin’ that I’m fighting demons
Dreamin’ I’m swingin’ on heathens
Competin’ and schemin’ to eat every piece of my peace when I’m sleepin’
Need a priest and a deacon
When I’m speakin’ to preachers tell ‘em I’m only at peace when I’m drinkin’
I’m sinking deep into hell, thinkin’ I’m fiendin’ for freedom
‘Cause being in a well isn’t good for my well being
A walkin’ zombie I be comatose, nobody loves a nobody
Who probably overdosed in the lobby of the omni hotel
Probably find me with an empty bottle of oxy
Shakin’ like an earthquakes inside me or I caught the Holy Ghost
Wonder if therapy can take care of these monsters
Before I kill more innocent people than Jared Lee Loughner
They spit on me, shit on me
Society kicked on me, hit on me til I was sick and exhausted
Flipped and I lost it off hallucinogenics
They using a clinic, I saw Lucifer’s image
The elephant in the room are my skeletons in the closet

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Wake me up before I’m dead
Don’t bury me with monsters in my head
Monsters in my head
With monsters in my head
And underneath the bed
Underneath the bed

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
I always see ‘em out the corner of my eye
Scared to death to fully see ‘em but I try
I just wanna ask ‘em why they follow me around
And they reply when I hear a sound
Or they walk by and give me a chill I can’t explain
It feels so strange is that a high
My anxiety’s at an all time high
One second I’m good then I flip a switch
Then I’m thinkin’ I might die
These dizzy spells are so annoying
From the outside looking in
Y’all thinkin’ I’m enjoying myself
I need help man, I’m destroying every positive force
With all these negative thoughts
How can I find happiness when I can’t remember it's lost
I do so many temporary things
To smile for just a minute
Hat low but not for style I’m tryna hide under my fitted dog
It’s wild you wouldn’t get it
Try my best to make everybody laugh
But that’s just a disguise, I’m really timid
Somebody make these feelings go away
Forget it, that’s my problem, y’all go ‘head
I hate these monsters in my head

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Wake me up before I’m dead
Don’t bury me with monsters in my head
Monsters in my head
With monsters in my head
And underneath the bed
Underneath the bed

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
It’s lights out like where the Amish stay
PAC, you can’t tax me
I’m like Wesley Snipes in a sovereign state
I’m a surviving walkin’ oxymoron
Obviously I can say that I am alive
And I’m tryna die this way
Ya’ll on your faggot shit
I’m on my "dragging my magnum clip"
With monsters in my head like Earvin "Magic" dick
Niggas dessert me like eating after the entrée
But I’ma keep it 3000 like after the Andre
I’ve adapted to a private life
Yeah right, you saying that is like sayin’
I’m shooting dice on a floor made out of dykes
I made out alive, this chaotic life
I just figured just quit giving dick to trick bitches and stay out of fights
But I’m on my high snortin’
You see this monster ball is like seeing Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton
It’s fucking classic
As far as rap, I wish I could wrap it in plastic
And stick it up your fucking asses
I’m a MONSTER

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Wake me up before I’m dead
Don’t bury me with monsters in my head
Monsters in my head
With monsters in my head
And underneath the bed
Underneath the bed

[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Take heed to what I’m giving you
Beefin’ is habitual
He just ridicules wants me in critical
Will appease and get rid of you
Maybe the only thing I seek is biblical
The scars are internal and the bleeding is invisible
Got a friend named depression, a pill I take to relax him
But when he regurgitates it’s the aches you just couldn’t fathom
Got a few talents but looking for a new challenge
I’ll let you walk in my shoes once I find a New Balance
With faith I stand peaceful, I know every man’s equal
So I’m playing with the monsters like a Space Jam sequel
Give ‘em two choices
Since they wanna do the least, tell ‘em they can get off my dick or renew the lease
Persevere though my bed is corrupt
Expect I give up when left to destruct
But I give less than a fuck
Sit back comfortably, react to what they want with me
The bright side is that they keeping an insomniac company

[Hook: Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
Wake me up before I’m dead
Don’t bury me with monsters in my head
Monsters in my head
With monsters in my head
And underneath the bed
Underneath the bed
