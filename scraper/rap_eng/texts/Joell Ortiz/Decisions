[Intro]
Mmm
Oh boy
I'm just sayin', I should just
I don't know
Think about this man, think about this road
A lot to lose, man
Uh

[Verse 1]
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, now which way I'ma go
Keep moving this fire blow or spit a fire flow
Hit the booth or hit the stoop and watch the sirens glow
Carry a gat or a napsack, my nigga, I don't know
Decisions, decisions, writtens are sick in the kitchen
Rhyme flex or Pyrex, shit, which is your vision?
Hit the block or book a studio block
Push all the rock or push yourself to rock a number one spot, hmm
Hit 'em with that bounce and find a nice pocket
Or stash another 8-ball in your side pocket
Kill 'em with the talent or kill 'em with talons
Metaphors and similes or meddle with chimneys
Small hallways or songs all day
Carry a sawed off gauge or get hauled off stage, hmm
Hit the plug and get a quarter or write some quotes, boy
Have 'em like, "That boy dope!" or be a dope boy

[Chorus]
Decisions, decisions
Honestly, I don't know what to do
This rap don't pay the bills but these crills, man they move
But if I go to jail, man I lose
Decisions, decisions
Honestly, I don't know what to do
This rap don't pay the bills but these crills, man they move
But if I go to jail, man I lose

[Verse 2]
Get it in my neighbourhood or fuck up the city
12-12 skinnies or plug up the midi
Have the fiends feeling like they base jumping
'Cause your base jumping or get that bass jumping
Decisions, decisions, trust me, this wasn't too easy
Stay in the trap or try to rap and keep up with Weezy
Try to impress Nas, Jay and Eazy, get your CD
Up in piece and riches or keep gettin' rich off the PC
Show off in that whip 'cause your album is sick or shit
Pull up to that bitch like you're Alpo and rich
Go in and out of town to get that show money
Or go in and out of town to get that low money
Fill that sneaker box, 999 trap money
Or W9s, 1099s and tax money
Working single non-stop until you make it crack
Or throw that powder in a pot until you make it crack

[Chorus]
Decisions, decisions
Honestly, I don't know what to do
This rap don't pay the bills but these crills, man they move
But if I go to jail, man I lose
Decisions, decisions
Honestly, I don't know what to do
This rap don't pay the bills but these crills, man they move
But if I go to jail, man I lose
