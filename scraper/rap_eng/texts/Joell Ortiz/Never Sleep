[Mr. Probz]
We never sleep
The block's hot 'till it rains
An I'mma keep goin' 'till the devil come and get me

[Joell Ortiz]
I can't rest up
I got a habit
Kid I'm out here messed up
Y'all don't know the half of it

[Mr. Probz]
We never sleep
The block's hot 'till it rains
An I'mma keep goin' 'till the devil come and get me

[Joell Ortiz]
Why the devil try'na take me away?
Why the devil try'na take me away?

Uh
E'day you walk past, you pro'ly notice me
I'm right there in the garbage gettin' my groceries
An' e'day I ask the lord: " 'dis is how is 'posed to be?"
Wintertime it's freezin' out here and my coat is weak
Summertime it's even worse, I damn near overheat
Ain't no AC strong enough to cool a [?]
I get jealous when the neighbors say that home is sweet
I can't go in: I'm always outside like Bruce Bowen's feet
Man, I remember when I had enough dough to treat
E'ry Mother's Day we packed in my Range Rover jeep
Me, my girl, my moms, and grandmoms used to go and eat
Red Lobster: 45 minutes before you on a seat
So here's a jewel for potheads: if you smokin' cheeba
Watch ya man's fill the Dutch up and control the leaf
I ain't know my man smoked [?], he was so discrete
Now e'day I'm sellin' e'thing and can't go to sleep

Uh
Man, I wonder what's in 'nere 'dat got me chasin' 'nat
No appetite, 'cause when I eat I only taste the crack
The smoke got my teeth yellow like my Laker's hat
Made my smile ugly, dog, I used to major mac
My son buggin' out, he treat me like a steppops
He still holdin' that grudge, 'cause I sold his Xbox
That boy crazy, think I let that go for 2 jacks
Man, I got a bundle for dat: I ain't no new jack
My fam' ashamed of me: they ship to them programs
I clean it up while I'm in 'nere, but I come home an'....
Y'all know the rest, a carpet ride in the sky
It's funny: I swear I hate it, but I like to get high
I grab that pipe an' I fly
When I come down, I'm so mad [No!]
So I hustle up ya bread to get one more bag
The other fiends, they just jealous, man, I watch 'em hate
Ya see they need the whole 10, I get my rocks for 8

Uh
I'm tired, it's like I'm standin' up half asleep
I don't even need a whole night, a lil' nap is sweet
This habit got me runnin' round like I'm an ath-a-lete
Underarms bangin', homie, I ain't take a bath in weeks
An' that's funny, 'cause, how I'm smellin' so foul
But go in grocery stores and clean out they whole soap aisle
I wanna quit and I would, but I don't know how
No I don't on second thought I think I wanna smoke now
Life sucks, 5 bucks was a beef and brat
No it's just 3 bucks away from a decent rock
I'm tired of e'body tellin' me I need to stop
You like the shit and try to quit, tell me that it's easy, pop
Trust me: you won't say nothin', you be fiendin', ock
Mouth on freeze like it's studyin' to be a cop
E'day I wake up like "That's it, Imma beat the rock"
But e'thing change when I turn that corner and see the block
