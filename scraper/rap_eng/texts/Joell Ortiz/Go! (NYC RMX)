[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Yeah that's right, I stays on the move
See yall tired a seeing my face on the tube
'Til the clubs spinning my joints to make it pop
'Til my feet in white sand and ya feet still play the block
Ya still tryin chase that deal, aight guys
I'm chillin, got a nice little spot in a high rise
Execs still telling yall all the laws got bye bye
That sucks, just bought a truck and new bike that I ride
It goes, 'vroom vroom', with a fatty in a thong
Sorry I had to go, but I'm happy that I'm gone
Don't you wish you could rhyme and get at me on a song
Well yall can't and I can, like Nas, so run along
You won't break me, instead I'm a break free
And paint a clear picture for the world in HD
So put ya eyes underneath where your shades be
Baby I gotta glow, feedback, but I gotta go

[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Each day is a moment, every second a bonus
Look up my name in the game, every record I own it
I'm a hex and an omen, I'm the best and I upset opponents
Stretching your neck and colon like wrestling Greco-Roman
Got a concert in Wisconsin fall
Turn Lambeau Field to a concert hall
Split personalities, my conscience brawls
I got more lines than a conference call
So hang it up, my bars payroll, got me in Barbados
Shooting videos in cars that star J-Lo
Depends how the day go, at the bar lay low
From a spark bars evolved to volcanos
Halos over your head hovers, the ground with reds covered
Pronounced dead while the blood bled flood us
Take years to get ahead of us
Looking at pro studio booked, I gotta go

[Verse 3: AWKWORD]
I watched my mom die, I wanna go too but I won't
My girl kicked me out, left me homeless and alone
Sold my car for cash, spent it on booze and dope
Guy on the couch, barely moved for the phone
Truth is, I was born, emotionally broke
And music's, how I handle all the ominous tones
Almost sold my Supras but I took 'em on the road
I know I can be super, I'm just starting slow
Gotta walk the tightrope, avoid curve balls thrown
Give me Trinidad's gold, even I wanna glow
I've always been afraid of not pushing envelopes
Now I leave myself notes and they all say 'no'
Even MTV folk, tell me that dope, though
Most people in the game hide behind cloaks
I guess they say God says you gotta keep hope
Even Agnostic AWK gotta keep it on the go (Go!)

[Verse 4: Aaron Cohen]
On your mark, ready, set, go
Like em' fat, got a heavy set, flow
Like em' thick, got a heavy set, ho
Aaron Cohen, though, you already, know
Cause all these other kids spitting silly shit
I spark the cypher, step up and get your Philly lit
Oh you a kingpin, nah, tell us what you really did
I stay flyer than the hockey team from Philly is
And these labels try and wheel and deal the kid
Like I'm new to this, I'll expose you like a nudist is
No religion, where the Buddha is
Dog I really do this shit
ICK the squad, never ask me what the movement is
And watch us go to war with these stars like George Lucas did
Cause that's the type of shit that I'm on
I ghost write for God, then ghost ride the whip and I'm gone

[Verse 5: K. Sparks]
I'm twice sicker the mic ripper the star bender
I make a living off of bars I'm a bartender
I run up on Elm street like yo where Freddy at
Stick em for the fedi that's deadly but we already that
Nobody checking for your album ahk truly wildin
When you come out, it does nothing for you Jason Collins
I murder features every time and I'm never stressing
Who the elephant in the room, now watch me bench press 'em
Not hypothetically legibly it'll never be
Instead of me I readily dead em because I'm better, b
Demanding I spit, my mans in the whip
Attitude included, sisters with they hands on they hip
See everybody tryna rap until the acting fails
Orange the new black until they really living black in jail
I black on beats and lyrically I murder them
Power to the people fighting evil out in Ferguson, Go!
