[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
She looking at me with the lusty eyes
Like what a guy
Ordered a slice of peanut butter pie
She fuckin' my head up
I wanna lift her dress up, kiss her from the chest up
Drop to both knees, lick the mess up
Cutie with a booty straight out of a movie
Juicy and I'm woozy, I gotta go do me
She telling me she dreaming of being an actress
7 months of practice, takin' them classes
Told her I know people that know people
Did some castings in Manhattan for my own people
She asked if I can plug her, my mind went to the gutter
Told her I'll make some calls, she gave me her number
Flashback to the club, champagne glass
She gave me her 'Gram, said she don't exchange math
Oh, well, guess I'm getting somewhere
The bill is clear, dropped my card, said I live near here
You can crash, not imposing, just an optional route
We both drunk driving and them coppers is out
She said, "Cool, you in the bed, I get a spot on the couch?"
I said, "Sure... but we all know what that shit about."
Got to my house, she said you got something I can sleep cool in?
Gave her a white tee and some ohlas I hoop in
She said these shorts too big, I'll do the tee
I'm proud of her, she shot her first movie with me

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz + Nitty Scott]
Little pre-madonna in the diner
Body on Kim, attitude like Rihanna
Face sorta-kinda like Beyoncé
I ain't tryna wine and dine her if I can't get behind her
Shorty tryna send me home mañana
Take me to the casa
Tryna break me off proper
Think you cool like that?
Yeah, I'm smooth like that
Nigga, you cool like that?
Yeah, I'm smooth like that

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
It was last call, let me call me a taxi
Then he passed me, talking to me raspy
Said this ass too classy for the backseat
We could slide and ride, you know, the afties
Now we rollin' and he gettin' me antsy
Told me the anatomy remind him of Cassie
Surfin' on my wave like the nigga was Max B
But he know if he touch right now, he gon' be at sea
Hold up, papa, please no R&B
That shit too blatant love, not in the V
Cop another pack 'cause he pack like armory
And he tryna give a mami the pump like artery
Let you put it in your mouth at the Waffle House
It's like 5am, ain't no falafels out
Get took, give him a look, you know the model pout
Big brain, after the rain I whip a novel out
Saturday up in the club we was trippin'
I don't usually dippin', must be what you had me sippin'
Now it's Sunday morning, think he up for scoring
Church goers looking at us like they know we been sinning
I'ma let a nigga get in like there wasn't a cover
I ain't beat for ya lover and I ain't meeting ya mother
Keep ya eyes on the road, highway to glory
You fuckin' with a Bori, another west side story

[Verse 3: Bodega Bamz]
I'm emotional
Cause my shorty let me go
She told me I can't fuck with you no more
Words keep playing in my head
If I had a dollar for whenever they try to holla
I swear to God we would be rich
Use to hit your celly
At any hour, no second guessing or worry about who you with
All I ever wanted
Was to be with you and me
I go out just to fade out, media take out
You ain't catch me fuck
I understand I was making out
Peer pressure called
It happened when I was breaking out
You know this lifestyle, might not make it
I'm human, most times might not take it
But this time shorty dress matched her complexion
And all I did was think about her naked
Face, run from the problems, never solve it
You was with me when I was whipping a Honda
And you came along when I was buying a foreign
I thought you be smarter
I thought I'd be too
On this lonely highway, she I might re route
I might peek a boo and see what you doing
Nah, nah, nah, that ain't my style
Plenty women love, I can pick one probably now
Ya voice up in my head, I can hear you say, "Boy, sit down."
Shorty crazy
Might shed a tear hearing half on a baby
Might kill somebody if I hear you really hate me
Through with who
I was the best nigga you ever had
My bitch bad though, shit I fucked up
I get a call from Joell 'cause he lucked up
Met some shorty in the city with the big butt
And he bragging like, "Bamz, why you left alone?"
I met this joint, had to take her home
Good for you, I replied
Then I get the FaceTime
I pressed cancel, sent a text, "Lol."
Told the nigga send a pic of hoe
When she's out the door
He like aight hold on, then he sent the pic
Ain't this some shit, Joell done fucked my bitch
Replied back like, "Oh, man."
He like, "What you mean?"
I'm like, "Oh, damn, nigga, do ya thing."
What goes around comes around, maybe that's right
On this lonely highway, swerved off Dyckman
