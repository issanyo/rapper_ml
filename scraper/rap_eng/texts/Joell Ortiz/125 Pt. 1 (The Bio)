[Intro]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all

[Verse]
Joell Ortiz but of course you crazy?
That kid's been nothing but short of awesome lately
His mixtape received 4 stars in the U.K
Turned S.O.B's down several Tuesdays
Valet it up on hot 9 with Kay Slay
He on NBA Live 05
Cuz EA sponsored the rap battle last year that he won
A flight from L.A. headed back to where he from
Six hours so he copped a little something to read son
Source Mag page 66 was a regun
He got Unsigned Hype the recognition had begun
Very next Monday was XXL's Chairman Choice
Recently the P.R. Parade got to hear his voice
Now he back in XXL this time show and prove
Cuz he writing hit records and his shows improved
He's the dude you need to worry about
Three more mixtapes done he fina' put those out
Thats how he laugh at doubt
If I was you I would clear his path
Cuz everything about him say you wouldn't really wanna feel his wrath
He turned down three deals this last month
Labels playing tug a war with his name, he who they want
He signing over here "Nope", He signing over here "Nope"
The both of ya'll wrong, he grinding over there
In a city near you trying to strengthen his fan base
Layin down cuts like a band-aid
Know how many dudes this man paid, the list is endless
He carried big crates just to get in the club
And when he got in the club he gave out his mixtapes
His work ethic is great, his drives like T-Mac's
You let him go or share a poster, RELAX
Ease back give him room to breathe
All those who hated will all soon believe
All those who made it will all soon just leave
Once their fans get a whif of Mister Ortiz
He spits it raw please, don't confuse him with these other cats
He's a full workout they three jumping jacks
Front to back he's an obstacle to overcome
I mean you know nothing's impossible but don't be dumb
He grew up in Cooper Projects so you know he's slum
The only child, homie wild, he the only one I ever heard nick named the Peoples Champ
Underdog all his life earned his stripes doing things he ain't like
Like igniting the fifth all night hugging the strip serving a pregnant bitch hard white
He happy that his mom's never sucked a glass pipe
She use to sniff, getting her off that shit was a fight
Why the fuck you think homeboy go hard when he writes
Trying to make his future bright cuz his past got him tight
His cash might be light, pockets empty kid
But same time next year its MTV Cribs
He put his life on it twice on it
To make sure he can't ask that, his crib must gon' have a nice price on it
Chandalier's with the ice on it, Persian rugs with no mice on it
Huge T.V screens with classics episodes of Miami Vice on it
Indoor pool and the floor got a mic on it
Plaques all over the wall with his name engraved nice on it
Man listen his ambition gonna have the game locked like the box in San Quentin
Fin to win his race cuz he ran different
In through the nose out through the mouth
Not worrying bout his competition radio clout
Look straight same pace let them nigga's be out
They true colors gonna show later on, when they breathing all heavy and they legs is worn
Duke gone from having an ill buzz in the street
Yo yo, don't nobody give a fuck when he speak
I know, it could happen in a couple of weeks
Lifes a bitch ain't it?
But me I love every picture that this kid painted
He the difference between artists and rappers
Artists draw hits, rappers take flicks
Other rappers trace-it, man these nigga's ain't shit
Everything's ba-sic, they should claim the same clique
That's why everything he give hip hop came sick
Like the syringe in the vein of an AIDS patient
Kane spit on this BK remix take that
The kid is co-signed by the dudes who made rap
Face facts G Rap told Mike he got a problem on his hands
Mike is Joell's A & R just so y'all understand
KRS responded with one word "Damn"
The cyphers complete once he shake Rakim hand
He a one man movement
General, Colonel, Sargent, Major, Private, and them youngin's on the front lines shooting
Gun high trooping through this war with his music
And he ain't gonna stop till he drop get use to it
He speak English fluent his spanish peque√±o
So doing reggaeton is a slight problemo, plus he sound moreno
They ain't know he was spanish till he transformed form quick and got his government established
But none of this matters, if you nice you nice
You could be Ethiopian rhyming for rice
You could be Hatian trying to rhyme for your rights
You could be South African writing rhymes for ice
You could be Cuban rhyming to cop you a nice, little boat that'll make it to the U.S. coast over-night
It is what it is, in this biz you live
When you die, that's when your records sales sky high
He tryin to rep while he alive, his heart still beatin'
Brain still dumbin' his nerves still tweakin'
Stomach still growlin' cuz what he's eatin
Ain't enough, bring the twelve gauge out its duck season
Give him one reason your career is gone
Say his name on a song he'll put yours on a tombstone
Not a pizza either, I'm talkin everybody black down crying to the words of a speakin preacher (Amen)
He's a deep believer, in what goes around comes around and whats coming around is dope
And what went around is his name and the strength of his flow
His ill show his radio appearances and mo'
Some things is maybe's and some things for sure
Some niggas is crazy and some nigga's M.O
Some nigga's is lazy and some nigga's just won't stop working till they get what they deserve, ya know!
That nigga is Joe E double L O R-Tiz, pa' please you one match in the snow
He's like a crib on the sun sitting next to the fireplace with the heater on a million and one
This young man is hot he'll sun tan your block
He gon' keep firing, your gun jam alot
Heat rise, expect to see this man on the top...

[Outro]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the most feared up and coming emcee of them all
Joell Ortiz what they call you crazy
That kid has been nothing but short of awesome lately
