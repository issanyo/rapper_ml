[Intro]
One, two, one, two
Turn this thing up a little bit
Yeah
For all those who been wondering what's going on with Joell Ortiz:
It's a lot man, it's a lot

[Verse 1]
Feels like I finally found my House Slippers
My mind was going, I stood around niggas
Wearing this pokerface, like I'm holding aces
That so wasn't the case, this
Business is such a business - don't take it personal
It's more than these beats and letting verses go
Don't end up locked in and wilding
Like a deaf person buying a rollie, better watch what you signing
Freedom is overrated until they take it
When it's gone, feel like nothing can replace it
Shaking the hand that's feeding you, but you hate it
Disappointed in meetings cause of your weight
Just imagine this man with your career in his hands
Giving a fuck about your fans
He just looking at that black and white
Seeing you ain't sell too well
You trying to tell him that you was on an Indie that wasn't acting right
He don't care, them numbers fucked up his appetite
Your past just fucked you twice, like a hermaphrodite
You watching niggas win who ain't half as nice
Faced with the choice of giving in or hit the pad and write
But see the fans can't know
So you leaking freestyles and you nail that flow
Kids leaving out the venue like "he killed that show!"
Screaming YAOWA everywhere, but you ain't on that though
Your loved one's sick all in the mist of this
Watching moms shoot insulin, it's ridiculous
Your son got a mask on his asthma bed
His older brother acting up, cause he don't have his dad
The grind took forever, but it happened fast
Listen close y'all, it happened fast
Red eye flights out to cali, signs to Aftermath
Come back, sign to Koch, you and Allen laugh
You drop an album over here, left the label over there
Finally let it go y'all, the past's the past
Sorry for the delay on your order
But even in my off time I ran around the world with the Slaughter
My alter ego is a quarter of the best rap group
But I'm back to being me, yeah the Puerto-
Rican, niggas standing on the corner
With that work for the fiends who wanna hear him more maturer
Story of a project nigga, a New Yorker
Getting money with the I-still-fuck-a-nigga-up-quick aura
Man, this ain't for radio play
This for the radio raheems who let their radio play
For the heads on the neck clicking, looking for the best writtens
Turning to their man like "you hear what he say?"
Y'all niggas tryna recreate back in the days
I'm just trying to rap my ass off
Hoping maybe I'll impress a few niggas from back in the day
Because I'm finishing these new niggas that's rapping today
You turn this up, but not too loud niggas
Feels like I finally found my House Slippers

[Outro]
House Slippers (fading)
