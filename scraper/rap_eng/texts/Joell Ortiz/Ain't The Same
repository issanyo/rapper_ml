[Intro: KRS-One]
You know it's Kris!

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they running this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and popping them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we popping they brains out
It's supposed to be about seeking in the seek out
You witnessing injustice, you got to speak out
If you claiming you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you running over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A hip-hop guild we got to begin building 'em
It's supposed to be no police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of our lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about making it better
You see, hip-hop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead, be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doing your part, that's how it's supposed to be
Pursuing your art, that's how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, that's how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you moving slowly
Then talking junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I Touch "50 MC's" like Tony
Everybody in the hood ain't your homie
I spit the truth, but I'm not the only
There's plenty, K-R-S-O-N-E

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one, it's supposed to be
