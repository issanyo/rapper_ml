First of all I'm the realest, Down South I'm about to make the whole East Coast feel this
This dude is the illest I'm so cool this summer I'mma do chinchillas
Plus I ain't never scared I'm fearless all you ever do is Cop Out, Bruce Willis
I don't wanna go to jail but I'mma kill this
Lemonade was a popular drink and it (still is)
Had to take a sip of this, with a flow that's ridiculous
You don't know who this nigga is I get hoes like St. Nicholas
Every show is like Christamas I can just go and pick a gift
Get some dome in the sickest whip send her home when she finished with
I ain't no pimp but my talk game legitimate
I'm from a housing tenement down in Brooklyn like B.I.G and them
I'll be here Forever that's why I stood next to Eminem
Haters wanna be like me but that'll just make them synonyms
Everytime I lift a pen baby boy I just get it in
Maybe that's why my pockets seem like they should be sponsored by Entenmanns
You hit it right on the button I get them Benjamins
My attitude could be so disgusting but I'm a gentleman
But you violate I'll annihilate your career
This year I'mma make sure I buy Sanna Lathan a beer
Like when doctors shocking your chest I'm just making it clear
'010 is mine so give it up or I'm taking it there
Everybody's hands in the air it's a stickup
Don't flinch don't move don't hiccup
I don't wanna hear you breathe you wheeze Ortiz'll be lighting this bitch up
This been my dream since I was 13 in the seventh grade
When I hear my record played it feels sweeter than lemonade
