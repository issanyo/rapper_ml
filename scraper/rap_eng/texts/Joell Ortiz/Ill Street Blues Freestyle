[Verse]:
I'm right in front of my projects, thinkin' of a plan
On how to get this gwap, see my pockets be in the sand
I'm callin' papi, he got me, prolly drop me 100 grams for starters
Time to turn into a barber, shave the crack up
12 12 regulars, get packed up
The fiends is gonna be buggin' when they see the size of mine, I'm finna stack up
Biggest misconception of this hustle is that you gotta stretch
You bag more, but I flip like a million times, you dudes ain't finished yet?
I gotta keep the fiends happy so they tell a friend that tells a friend
Before you know it, they chipped in, bought Joell a Benz
That's where the sellin' ends
Get yourself a strip, a couple hungry youngins, move onions and once you get a brick
Man, you got the hustle in the palm of your hand
You bag up like half, the other half you add on points to the gram
Supply scrams, you got a plan that was just like yours
You doin' it son, now where's your gun (why?)
Cause some kids quite poor
They eyein' you, from afar like they just might score
Matter of fact I'm buggin', what you think that dudes get right for?
C'mon, use your head, spend that bread, keep 'em fed, they'll become your led
You'll never have any problems puttin' crumbs to bed
Oh yeah, never name your clique, let's stay away from Feds
The minute you try to organize they'll try to listen in on what you said
And you don't want the kind of numbers they be givin'
Some dudes literally live in prison, better not touch that television
Niggas is in the best condition that they ever been
I mean, scrap if you gotta scrap, but listen homes, nine out of ten...
You lose!
