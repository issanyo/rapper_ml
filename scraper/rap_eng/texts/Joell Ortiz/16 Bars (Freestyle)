[Verse]
I make everybody on the block rejoice
Feel your bitch pussy, I bet your mommy moist
You pick them over me? You made a sloppy choice
I ain't got to say my name, ya know the papi voice
And I don't need to make a hit, I got dumb rhymes
So y'all make the hits, I'll rip em and they'll become mine
I just been sitting back watching niggas piggyback
On that "bring the city back" slogan but that shit is wack
'Cause New York never left homie
I just been shredding this weight on the bench doing chest homie
What y'all thought, I stopped rapping? That ain't like me
Fam I be in every city lab like a white tee
But the game's full of lame niggas poliing
Never do a feature if they feel you gon' body 'em
But stumble on a hit, and they all jumping ship
But see, I'm Captain Phil, I got a trick for Somalians
Either embrace me or face me
'Cause when you don't befriend me, then that offends me, I'm angry
And I hope a nigga says "Tell 'em why you mad?"
So I can punch him in the face and let him tell you how I jab
This booth hot 'cause I'm the truth [?]
So turn the volume up and let your box boom on The Boombox
