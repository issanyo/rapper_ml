[Hook: Novel]
I've been going crazy, working past midnight on that night train
So, I lay down my tracks, and I can't complain
I'm not going to give up until the whole world knows my name

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Got long days and longer nights
Navigating through a world full of wrongs and rights
I'm too tired to fight
But too strong to die
So, I pick myself up and keep pushing on tonight
Man, I'm grinding to the bone sweatin' 'til I dehydrate
Waiting for something better to get my life and my mind straight
Steadily taking penitentiary chances with my fate
Trying not to be a statistic behind the high gate
And I don't know what the future got for me
But, looking back at my past, it's got to be a better story
Got to be a bit of glory
On the other side
Sweet chariot swing down, let a brother ride
Tonight
I understand that the world ain't perfect
I just want to be sure in the end that it was all worth it
Worth the struggles
Worth the troubles
And the pain
All the stress on my brain
Putting my days in on the night train

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It's been a long road
That's what my songs told
Fans before their hands were waving, I was on hold
With fuzzy cornrows
And being the norm blows
So I perform flows
With no darn dough
And with torn clothes
I'd wipe my face and say
Drop the bass then spray
In a sort of Jamaican way
I'd make them sway
To the hatin's nay
And I won the race then hey
They say come, Mr. Yates and play
With EPMD, Quik and Kwame
But it was graduation day
So I chose rap
But a KCMO cat
Was slow tracked
To the finicky industry, it was no haps
I wasn't a type to rock gold teeth and throwbacks
So I froze that
And I gave major record companies the bozack
And now my life's changed
Me and Travis had to ignite Strange
Music, keep moving through it and fight pain
Now the way I'm living is nice mayn
Cause I strained
Got migraines
Writing flames
On the night train

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Damn, this desert feel like a 142
I want to chill at the base but I got a tour to do
This backpack feel heavier when you on the sand
My sergeant, he moving our squad to Afghanistan
Damn, I miss my man
Rest in peace Doc
I see him shot
Just screaming and then my dream stops
The food is extra trash so I don't eat a lot
What I wouldn't give for that cuchifritos spot
Or a pizza shop
Or a sneaker spot
Or little chica's twat
Why I leave the block?
I wonder who bumping in everybody speaker box
And how many RBIs my nigga Jeter got
I'm 4 and a half hours after, it's 3 o' clock
I've been killing kids with this freaking Glock
They say you sleep better if you doing the right thing
This must be wrong, I'm wide awake, them bombs is louder than night trains
