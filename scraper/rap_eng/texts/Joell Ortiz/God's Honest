[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
I'm from New York City my nigga, I'm never overdoin' it
Thinking till I make it, "I'm too real for all that stupid shit"
Murder music, I'm provin' enough to make this lead fly
Jiggy like I'm mason and witty like I'm from Bed-Stuy (Biggie)
R.I.P. but I'm a Tanboy
Took a camera crew with me to see me hand to hand, boy
Sitcom I'm a stand boy
Pay that commissary get my people out that can boy
Fuck a retweet and a favorite
Drink that Henny slow ‘cause every sip, I gotta savor it
Flying South for the winter, Atlanta, Decatur
Fuck True Religion, I'm the savior, curly hair with the razor
In the morning say a prayer, "God forgive"
But I'm not him, and I got bills, and I got kids to look after
This ain't no reggaeton, I'm a Latin rapper
If I could take your life away then I could dig the hole after

[Hook: Bodega Bamz]
Load the motherfucking clip
Cock the bullet in the chamber
Now get these motherfuckers killed
Load the motherfucking clip
Cock the bullet in the chamber
Now get these motherfuckers killed
Load the motherfucking clip
Cock the bullet in the chamber
Now get these motherfuckers killed
Load the motherfucking clip
Cock the bullet in the chamber
Now get these motherfuckers killed

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
God forgive me, I'm armed with millis
My squad is silly, armed robbery, chilly
Ice mug marksman fiendin' to launch
A million little pellets in your heart's artery, really
This ain't no rap shit, niggas clap shit
That's God's honest, you feel me?
Your little hoes ain't love me
A nigga nose was runny
A nigga clothes was bummy
My mommy ain't have no money
So I'm back and forth to that sto'
For them trap trappers you know
But what happens after you go
A couple times and they start to like you
Yep, my first package was blow
Lil Ido traffickin' snow
That's the nickname that they gave me, now I got Bo Jackson [?]
Niggas ain't have no jokes no mo'
Niggas knew my hands a go
But they heard I back out that fo' fo'
They wondering if my cannon blow
But nobody wants to be the first to find out
Lucky them ‘cause I'd a blew they mind out
Young dumb and stupid with nobody to put me in time out
Yeah I went the rhyme route, what y'all know what I'm 'bout?
I move tan, boy, now I move with the Tanboys, let me find out
