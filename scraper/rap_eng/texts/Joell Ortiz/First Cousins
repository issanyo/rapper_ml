Now we all get to know what it's like
When I..some assholes is gonna step out of the dark and blow your head off
I want you to know what it's like to live that way
You tell them what I shine
Yeah I swear I'll be that son
Brooklyn going under
..any Brooklyn you know
..I know what it is, let's go
My surroundings..sounding gangstas..
Dead and puff bodies get founded
Brooklyn what a finding street puffing
Be..noisy people in the window hoping that see something
Fees buggin the live the short
..plan and both courts and hustles with all source drunk
Grindings game is also source..truth thugs
Puertoricans on their stupid nug
Think up these across the street and who these little villains
Young cats up in the stores dealing
Pussy nigga you snuffin and all..
Lot of tryin to hit for that million street rappers
Hope bag and murder mouth..burning out the flash
Shoot patch and stash in the grass
All this hustle in the crack in their ass
I mean that's just like
My fire just want to be gangsta and ..begins by guns
Ad find excuses to fire
It's the possession of broken nobody's hiring..profiling
And mother fucker they smiling
Great to have the baby she's pregnant now for the eight
The father stuck the child support the screaming it ain't mine
Hard I see the burn when return the corn..
And if somebody get murder nobody saw in nothing
Everybody is a .. and say a..pot
Get their first advance and blow it all the rest shot
Little kids are hustling when they're hiding work for their mom dudes
What rats is fucking their bullets the Louie Vuitton boots
They kill the..doing for the right proof
Recipe's the side and that's the hard truth
I tear apart boom my shit is the road
No matter where I go..New York

Hook:
Is the birth place spitting we're pushing into the limit
You talk about it but live it, where you from where I'm from
We the pitchin and selling pussy hustlers on the corner thugin
And haters are mean buggin, where you from where I'm from
We've been hustling in the park but they working at the dark
Man you gotta have hard where you from where I'm from
..fronting you ain't from where I'm from
We get body livin..
My surroundings used to get..my caffes
Standing out side of the high ride these past days
Always wonder why those breast less cops
Take this picture while this men took express less shots
Round here you might see a garden.. around the block
..the church don't care 'cause it feels upstairs
..pills upstairs, round here people talk
Cracks in the air made us here hookers..never heard from a gang gone goodbye
Really really streets get the..and kill it to me and..
You could real finish time to go we write the story
In category fully rappers you..euphory
Bitches wonder why they single and lonely
Belong me the first night you kiss the canoly
That's life, that's right that's build over the goons
Coming Mc's stop em I'm running heel
First show me you might be going..
Get off the corner..strange thing that's happening
Team is in position now we international
I ain't left the spaceship holding down the..you will running down the..
Higher than your average grind, the snoop wonder my pistol still illegal
Cause I'm done gun up, silence on the ..premeditate your feet
So unfortunate still my..trouble
Beast on queen what's wrong with me
I had the FBI watching my family
I learn the deep cold gangstas on this stand on me
I rain the streets cold guess..I wash them all breathe most randomly
Stop and get em real

[Hook:]
