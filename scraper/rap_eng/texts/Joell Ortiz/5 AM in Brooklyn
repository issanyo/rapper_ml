Y'all know me, I flex muscle on anything, ain't a beat safe
Can't just go flaunting that heat in Joell Ortiz' face
Been hoping that a frog would jump, it's so much leap space
But yeah, nobody took to the air, I got their feet placed
Firmly on the pavement, nobody want it with greatness
I'm mean mugging these niggas and never getting a facelift
How is he your favorite? Them bars he give up is basic
Guess niggas start sounding better when YAOWA take a vacation
I've been running around the world with the Slaughter, but boy I'm back
Get ya papi right back out on that corner with all the crack
A couple kilos of raw, just shot a couple of packs
And a couple of y'all'll flip if a couple'll spit out this mack
Man, the whole block changed, this the hip hop game?
Sweet kool-aid running through niggas' popped veins
Must a Brooklyn enigga come through again? Pop chains
Smack niggas and make 'em dissapear like it's pop's name
This my playground, be scared when I swing through
Fear when I slide by, y'all seesaw what the kid do
I was hot when I was a baby, on fire as a young toddler
Dry ice as a teen, todya I'm made out of lava
I swear to God when I say I'm the best, man, I really mean it
Not confident or conceited, just standing here undefeated
Please don't be fooled by the quantity from these heathens
When your head is full of air you could do a lot of leaking
See my name next to it, know a flame swept through it
And that's the song on the joint where the mixtape get stupid
Got throwaway bars that could go invade mars
And I hang with the kind of Marshall that don't tow away cars
5 AM - that's the time I set my alarm
Wash up, throw on sweats, go jogging along the pond
That's what I call a river my condo is sitting on
Which house has the pretty stars y'all niggas just wish upon
You could kiss Joell, baby, just don't kiss and tell
You ain't gotta tweet me, my digits is in your cell
Please no Instagram, a picture can only tell
A thousand words, have a million positions all to yourself
My personal life is private, my public life is a riot
Write on so many planes, my pen of choice is a pilot
Diffent currensy, different customs, my body is tired
But everything is working out, so yeah, I decided to dye it
Lost a couple of LB's, no more triple XL tees
And my pythons look like anacondas, you'll yell please
If I put you in that sleeper, plot a Joell squeeze
Then tighten it to your knees, Give in and you spell Z's
You know I can really fight, right nigga?
Your man'll think I'm wrong if the right, right'll hit ya
Your face gone look like a great white bite ripture
Two evenings in a row, yeah, night, night nigga
I've been jumping hurdles since Excitebite, nigga
You probably was with your sister making light bright pictures
I came up in the projects, you niggas ain't that wild
Walking up the stairs I was crunching up crack vowels
Walking outside, I was ducking their clap louds
Sounded like a M.O.P. kind of record, click clack blow
See, stand-up niggas get easily sat-down
And the cops get there three hours later for pat-downs
I've been rhyming forever, forever been seeming short
Infinity is like a blur, I'll never run out of thought
Broke as a motherfucker, I still held down the fort
Respect don't have a price tag, some things can't be bought
I was schooled by the OG's, right up under the action
Bottom of 40 tapping, right there on Kingsland and Jackson
Dopeboy fashion, ropes, gold caps, Girbauds and Bo Jacksons
When starter hats was snapping
Funny, I'm just rhyming, y'all listening like I'm snapping
Any rapper indirects, I'll be listening like ''what happened?''
I gotta make sure I ain't gotta go break jaws
Or have my goons in your hotelroom on the 8th floor
Before this Twitter shit y'all ain't even know I was funny
Cause in every rhyme I uttered I gave you the gutter from me
I got a sense of humor, see, I ain't have a choice
Your jokes had to be fly when you came up bummy
Nope, no money, yup, so hungry
When food fell on the floor we picked it up in a hurry
Saying ''God made dirt'' and dirt don't hurt
Really, I stomach like throwing that out ain't gone work
Yeah, I started from the bottom now I'm here
Not the top, not the bottom, I'm somewhere
In the middle, not coach, not a layer
Ain't wake up in a new Bugatti, but I steer
Through these New York streets, I see clear in my rear
-view-mirror all the bad bitches stare
Guess I'm rolling smooth enough to things I'm doing in this truck
Please, no jury duty, man, I swear (no joke)
Anyway, to all my fans, yo, I'm sorry
I gotta end this verse, but these niggas know they can't harm me
Don't ever try to keep me out the party
Invited or uninvited, I'll be in there with my army
