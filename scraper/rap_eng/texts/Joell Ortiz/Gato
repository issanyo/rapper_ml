[Verse 1: Bodega Bamz]
Chachooo, that's the life of a gato
Big cat, mixing up with the Sazon
Did that, I remind them of Lavoe
Two hours, Came late to my own show
El Watusi, Hiyabusa, Pop willies
Watch movies, halfway, shawty do me
Missed calls, I counted; like twenty
That nigga interrupting my heady
Moe Moe Moe
I'ma ign'ant fella
And shawty left you 'cause I listen better
And I get you angry, but I ain't get you angry
Blame her, only her, if it makes you happy
Called a taxi
Send her back home with the shame face
Sex anywhere I don't come from the same place
All the time high, I don't come with the same stakes
One of one
No namesake
Sazon

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Just out sold out Tokyo
Y'all know who it be, the yogi wit da Bori flow
Hate bogies but I’m always wit a smokey hoe
No karaoke though, these niggas all Pinocchio
I’m like okey-doke
Send 'em to the chokey bro
I ain't really here to add to your portfolio
I been up, marauding on award tour
Check the scoreboard, who I’m doing scores for
Zoolander, know these bamas wanna ban her
Catch in me in the bando with a tan bandana
Goddamn, I be rocking like ya man, Santana
If you wanna eat Chiquita gotta show me the banana
Wrecka since the first EP
Only chick wit chancletas on B-E-T
When if pop, better not, call it P-O-P
They don't want me on the charts, what if we odee?
I heard bitches think we waiting on batons
You the only one nervous at the marathon
Promise when I get it I won't forget all my bitches
Imma show you how to go for ya riches, & PUT 'EM ON
Think you betta, suck a teta, puñeta
Might straight ash on ya tape, it's so mierda
I’m baked, making a plate of chuletas
All my girls came to play, they muñecas

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Chacho
Live the life of a Gato
Big cat and the 5th with the kick back
Wrist wrapped and the Roley don't tic-tock
My chick back
Look like she only did squats
Bad bitch uptown like, "Whoa."
Can't look down when I fuck her like, "Whoa."
Man, I'm blessed, Fort Knox near my chest
Got it on me even in my sweats
Be my guest
Rap niggas know how I mastered the flow
Racks on the road, yea they packed at the do'
After the show I'm relaxed wit ya hoe
Back at the Hotel glasses of mo
Got some Ricans in the dirty dirty
They one whistle away from New Jersey, heard me?
Chacho, head honcho muchacho
No mentiroso papa let shots blow
