Hook
One gun in the bedroom closet
Keep one downstairs my basement rocket
I keep another in the safety deposit
Shit, I got two of'em with my moms in the projects

Verse
When its beef nothing matter we pull up with nannas
Show up ready for work with ratchets and hammers
Faces under bandanas out the way of cameras
Cannons looking like fire trucks with extended latters
Go ahead and knock the playboy I don't play with ops
Before I signed with Dr.Dre I used to Dre my blocks
My (??) was named Pito and he stayed with blocks
I gave it a bath and it rock the fiends favorite stock
Was my spot round the clock we was making that guap
Ask still Pedro made it hot tryna cater to cops
See I grew where the death of yah is regular
We poured a little henny but etcetera etcetera
We cry dried mucus then
Life kept movin' an
Next day we kick it like (street fighter sound)
Its survival of the fittest
Hittas dying every minute
I ain't talking low bows when I put iron on yah fitted
Run it
Come up off it start tryna forget it
Act like you never had it that pride gon get you clapped
Dont be stupid and die from tryna to come get it back
Cause thing stay with me I ain't gotta go get the strap
These shits attached to my hip I'm siamese with gat
Baby bottle nozzles fire these you take naps
Yall dont see me in them clubs I dont do well with crowds
So if you see me Fif just know that them Fifs around
