Let me tell you what i'mma do today
Today is just me and you , you & I for Q & A
I know the questions that you gonna ask
But i'mma do is say
What's on my mind i'm just telling you why

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz ]
This ain't, snapback meets new era
This new era gets smacked till they necks snapback and that goes for whoever
I ain't done workin
I'm just one person
That promises to keep this shit pure like a young virgin
Your dumb virgin(version) of Hip Hop got us uncertain
Your daughter dress like a nigga, nigga your sons twerkin
I'm still a two steppa, steppin with two heffers
Still step to your crew extra quick that's what I do
Let's tell em why I'm a thoroughbread
Born and raised in that Brook, you shook, look what my borough bread

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz ]
All this time away from working solo snapping photos
With my bro bros in the slaughters been an honor
But I’m back to dolo
Feet is Nike the hat is Polo, I’m no fashion logo
No gay bashing, but if you tough don’t be acting homo
Let me tell you why I hit the tread
Wasn’t to lose weight and get this bread
Naah homie you’ve been misled
Last year I shot a fair one with my nigga Fred
And damn near drop dead
I should’ve won but I got whipped instead
I ain't liked that so I stopped that liquor to the head
Dropped the Newports
Copped new shorts and watched my figure shred
You coughing chicken heads, speaking of cuffs
I made the slut merry my nigga in prison
To give him visit head
Man let me tell you why I’m real rap
Why I don’t need a rope chain
Or dress like Soul Train to bring that feel back

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz ]
This is for those who ain't know that Ortiz spit clean
Its every lil girl's birthday, here’s a sweet sixteen
Went from a 40 waist to 36 jeans
But that forty still on my waist, with mean sixteen
But I ain't here to talk how I protect myself
Or how I lived in the gym last year to perfect my health
Nah, we can rap off, I off you rap niggas with a rap off-the-top
I ain't wrapped too tight, back off
Off the back door to the bleachers hit the teacher off
The black board and in Ya’ll in-crowd but mad off
Ya’ll [???] and tight slacks with hard bottoms
Hit the bottom hard after you moon walk like Mic Jack
Huh, BRB I don’t mean be right back
I mean B you’re R&B singing, I write raps
But Ortiz you went all complex and said this shit
Yeah you right, aight cool let me extend a clip
Penmanship my pen is sick
You in the Pen then hit the bench and lift
Chest against the bar, do an extra six
Every year some new nigga they put the best against
Put their neck on the line but I twist it up like the exorcist
If I’m your comp I understand why you a pessimist
Point blank with infrared scope bet these pests will piss
Their pants they can't shoot at Godzilla, man them pellets itch
The fire that be leaving my mouth will melt your whole relevance
Lil niggas, lil boys is cute
My bars hard they hurt like Ray Mercer you don’t want it Duke
So save the subs for Quiznos keep the talking mute
Cause I punch you in yo big nose and watch yo faucet shoot
Ya’ll chasing pop hits, fuck a pop hit
One of my joints pop, shiit another cheque deposit
