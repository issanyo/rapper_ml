In the beginning this was a hobby
Instrumented in a lobby 40 of old English nickel bag from papi wrote My own English, sloppy with the led notebook folded like Gotti with the feds
It's like dope metaphors have a party in my head i done formed a whole yawa army what I said from not having a dollar on me to this bread make Jowell Mattel keep Barbies in the bed
Every day I am on a flight
Every other night I am on the stage getting right
Every other second in between I just write
I am a machine like the Jordan collector i fiend for the mic
Can't run away to tell you the tales that I've been hurt
I couldn't count on one hand how many lie in dirt

Human flash is no match for heavy iron squirt fireworks make Brooklyn when it seems like it's July 4th i wake up to candles and empty henny bottles
You ain't gotta fear homie but fear the semi nozzle
It'll  change you from husky with a heavy wobble to in a hospital Skinnier then a fendo model
I attended the curb weight in this past summer ten minutes hug and slash mother in these streets you gotta bring you're A game like the bash brothers
It's bullshit that's why I carried Jordan last number
My arms strong like Bj on a sharp night come for these bills and end up in a cart right see
I refuse to die at their hand
A nigga fire from man a survivor i am it was not long ago I was buying them grams fucking hiding for benz take a nine from Joann
I am just being the best like the rest should
From the best hood Bk to the Uk with Westwood
