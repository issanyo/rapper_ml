[Joell Ortiz]
What?

[Woman]
Why are you hanging up the phone on me?

[Joell Ortiz]
Cause I'm not feeling you no more, yo
I knew it was like this, I knew you was playing games

[Woman]
Fuck! That is not true, hello
I don't even hear from you

[Joell Ortiz]
What the fuck you want me to do? I'm a fucking rapper

[Woman]
I don't hear from you
And, you gave me a fucking snotty attitude the other day
So what the hell I'm supposed to, like, think anymore?

[Joell Ortiz]
You fucking run around shaking your little
You fucking, run around shaking
Your little fucking ass at these, nightclubs
And then you fucking call me when you feel like it
I can't go through it yo

[Woman]
And you wasn't with nobody in the nightclub?
Cause you was with a whole bunch of chicks

[Joell Ortiz]
I'm a rapper!
