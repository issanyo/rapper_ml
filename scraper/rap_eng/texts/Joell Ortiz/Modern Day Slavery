[Intro]
They say nothing wrong
A change is gonna come
You know and I know
You know that I know
I know that you know that a gotta change is gonna come

[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
First you clean his hands from top to bottom
Grab the fabrics, then wash 'em
Then you go pick the cotton
Listen, y'all, I'm tired, man, I swear
(I've been running) for so long
Tryin' to be strong, but yo (I've been running)
I'm exhausted, my feet hurt
(I don't) Wanna run no more
(I don't) Wanna run no more
They said (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Ain't nothin' changed 'cept the chains
They're restrainin' our physical frame
Mentally we're still livin' the same
It's lockdown, they knocked down the Towers to raise tax
Anything they borrow we pay back
I live in the hood; you'll never bump into Pat Sajack
But we spin the wheel every time we chill
Cops hate Blacks and Hispanics
They draw gats and just blam it
Before they ask where your hand is
I don't see how a wallet can be mistaken for a cannon
So please don't let 'em play us no more
In every way I'm ready, willin', and able to war
Like any day now it could pop, I'll be in the front
Like, "Please may the force be with me and this pump."
Housing want me to work 'cause I'm still on my mom's lease
Threatenin' to raise the rent if I don't pick up them park leaves
Ain't nothin' in this world for free
But somehow they got us fooled like this world is free

[Hook]
This is modern day slavery, you see, carry ID
Water is a fee
This ain't how it's supposed to be, man
(I've been running) for so long
Tryin' to be strong, but yo (I've been running)
I'm exhausted, my feet hurt
(I don't) Wanna run no more
(I don't) Wanna run no more
They said (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)
When? (a change is gonna come)

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Our people are the product of genocide and slavery
Everything in the ghetto was how it was made to be
Designed in a process, Prison Industrial Complex
Niggas transformed into numbers and objects
We pay the Devil rent for livin' in hell
'Cause the projects was built on the spot where Lucifer fell
Incarcerated knowledge heavy weight
Every black man should read Deuteronomy Chapter 28
Cursed in the city like we're cursed in the field
Cursed on the border, and cursed by the New World Order
Our sons and daughters were stolen by another people
Yoke of iron, end of the Earth, Land of the Eagle
This is the sequel to the prophecy
Freedom, whether peaceful or violent, is my philosophy
I built an army, now I'm gonna build a nation
The foundation of a new civilization
And overthrow the plantation

[Hook: Immortal Technique]
This is modern day slavery, see?
It was designed to be, Patriot Act 3
Just wait, young nigga, you'll see
(I've been running) for so long
My people been so strong, but yo (I've been running)
I'm exhausted, my heart hurts
Gunning them all, I'm gunning them all
I said, we gotta make a (change come)
We gotta make a (change come)
Quick, motherfucker, lock and load!

[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, Joell Ortiz
Harlem, Brooklyn
You know what it is, nigga
The rebirth of the Young Lords
Coming soon, motherfucka
You sleep and you die, nigga
Good night, motherfucka!
