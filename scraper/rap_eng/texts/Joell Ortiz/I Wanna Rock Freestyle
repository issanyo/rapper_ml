[Intro] [Joell talking]:
What up Peter? It's Joell, I've been on tour. These girls been lickin' my peter. Check. Yaowa

[Verse]:
Ortiz got stupid flow
So let me go and give this beat from Snoop a go
No tres, no dos, I'm uno numero
The Puerto Rican Rosenberg, of Jew/you don't know?
E'rytime I rhyme the throne get closer
E'ry show some hoe gets roller coastered
E'ry verse get worse, I'm better with time
I'm the alpha and the omega, y'all lemon and lime
You got a brand new leather in mind
I got a swear to God I'll take out whoever in mine
I'm only on the first leg of my grind
Long as y'all here I'm vampires, suckers that'll never get shine
Jeah, I'll make your career rot in the cemetery
My name pop, I'm on top like missionary
I can't stop, I'm hot like 9-7 every
Single day tell Cipher I said "Hey!"
