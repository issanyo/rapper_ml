[Intro: samples Eddie Arkadian, the villain from "The Last Dragon" movie]
Welcome to my little party in your honor
The guest list has been compiled
So that you go out in style
You don't mind if my friends introduce themselves, do you Leroy
Then let the games begin

[Verse 1: Jean Grae]
Back up in the booth and my "V" is for Vendetta
Fuck the last rhyme, to tell you the truth I got ten better
I bend letters over til they look like "n's"
And then offend so many men with them they look like fems
I'm a feminine rebel, forever cleverer than your shit
Never be level with niggas' shit, my flow can float bitch
Figure out the dosage to administer vaccines
Sickness I invoke in close, considered the Black Jean
It's Blakroc, it's Blacksmith, Miss Grae and I'm back, bitch
Hulk-smash, harass a motherfucker most passionate
(Passionate, passionate) Fashion plate, magistrate
Fascinating lady, grab your Vaseline and masturbate
Emasculate your manhood, possibly damn good
Dismantle all your posse turn them pussy with tan hoods
Don't push me, I don't land good
Liable to fly up off the handle like a pan would
And swoosh, hit Mrs. Woods

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Salt rivers flowing out my eyeballs
Pierced side, broke legs, bearing my cross
The old heads told me life wasn't a game
But mine steady feeling like pinball, dodgeball
Chasing freedom, establish a kingdom
And build a stone castle out of thinwall, drywall
I'm a keep going til God call or the sky fall
Or they blast me on a grassy knoll and try to blame Oswald
Average Joe Blow, mastering my mojo
Cinderblock, karate chop, practice in the dojo
If it's so-so I'll probably be a no show
Shooting the willy bobo out on Nostrand with the po' folks
Black dragon rap, flames out the nostrils
From Crown Fried to Roscoe's I'm spreading the gospel
I overcame like the Saints done the Falcons
Like Hoover did to Malcolm

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
YAOWA
Y'all know what the fuck I do, bubblegum buster
So easy to fucking chew, lyrics I blow bubbles to
Unoriginal, it's easy to make another you
Finding my telly keys the only way you'll get a W
Niggas ain't grizzly, y'all all soft and huggable
I came up in the gutter, you came up like all the Huxtables
You don't want me to black-belt-to-death you
Karate chop your pops, Liu Kang kick your nephew
HIYAOWA, to hell is where I send em
Y'all just learned the art, I been tighter than your denims
I'll Ryu or Ken em, I'm classic with the pen
Give me five minutes I'll show you I'm deadly with the venom
Poison with the darts, see your boys be in the park
My boy be in the park, he annoying all the narcs
We two different types, see, you spit what you write
What I spit is the truth and truth comes to the light

[Verse 4: Mos Def]
Bang bang, tobacco road, smoke show, mofo sensei
Blue cloak, red stripe, get right head shot
Bass bang, necks crane, fresh construction when
Ski percussion blend Auerbach "Boogie Man"
Brought all my cousins again, sisters and brothers and em
Bey's day, Center Edge, overs and unders of them
Ain't no fucking with them, ain't nann suckers within
Never closed, hella flows, ice cold, never froze
Me and the exceptionals, too high to get over on
Abdul-Jabbar tippy-toes, game point
Pick and roll, give and go, no ordinary miracle
Freedom fighters' spiritual, eagle eye aerials
Sun spot, mountain top, fresh water fountain drop
Open-eyed dreams, fresh green, quartz countertop
The ashtray, that 3rd water Kings county rock
Black heed powerhouse, can't shut the power out
Tell 'em quit wildin' out, show ya what I'm bout about
Tune in, senator, this how you turn a party out
She get fresh, yes, to help her stretch your body out
Get live and hurricane black don will air your body out
Cash and carry then I'm outty out
ONE, Center Edge
