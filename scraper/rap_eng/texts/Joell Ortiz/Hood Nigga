You ain't no hood nigga (repeated)
(La la la la lalalala)

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
You understood nigga
You ain't no hood nigga
Barbecue chips and a butter roll it's good nigga

Let me see you roll one
Where you get that dutch from
When you had your last fight
Where you buy that, Shop Right?
Cause you ain't come in this store
Nigga with your glass jaw
Why you think you hardcore
You don't want this .44 pointed at your mug
Cause I'm wetted off a drug and that molly got me bug
And your chain is looking love
Ha
You ain't a hood nigga
What's good nigga
Chicken wings and fried rice is good nigga
I ain't turn bougie
I be in the hood drinking liquour in my Gucci
Real nigga's salute me ha

[Hook]
You ain't no hood nigga (repeated)

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Bubblegum wrapper fronts manhunt that's my car
To gold fronts and a manhunt from clapping at pa
You ain't no hood nigga
We don't believe that
Now tap the bottom of this brown where that weed at
I bring the fiends back with that hard white lambing on the crate
On the block but the rocks in a magnet on the gate
Never catch me slipping I'm in slipper but whatever
The beretta's in the store I go to war in Chancletas
I'm a hood nigga
You get with house work
You ain't never come outside and when you did you took the outskirts
You let me ride your bike I had it the whole night and your moms forced you to fight

[Verse 3: Billy Danze]
You ain't no hood nigga
You scared to leave your section
Relying on the police for protection
I don't know your kind of hood nigga
You got your face all mean rocking a girly boy top matching your spandex jeans
It's either good due or Gorilla, there's nothing in between in my hood nigga
Everything is what it seems
If your realest beef is on Twitter
It's fit for a Queen
Don't come outside with these killers get ripped at the seams
You ain't a hood nigga
I bet you curl up on the couch watching the lifetime network while twerking it out
It's like your chromosome get rattled when hood nigga's battle
We get loose and I ain't talking bout the booth

[Verse 4: Trae The Truth]
You ain't no hood nigga
Where your stripes at
Where your block bitch you ain't built like that
You ain't got no hood pass where you play your nights at
Say you keep that toolie on you nigga where your pipes at
Nigga's doing time bitches they don't give no kites back
Nigga's trying to look at some pussy where you Nikes at
Pork and beans and weiners Ramen noodles and a chopper hoe
Eight nigga's one rule: re-up in the locker hoe
Hoping we don't fuck it off
City try, block's dead everybody talking
You the main reason the block's scared
You ain't that gangster type nigga you just gangster type
All across the internet nigga that ain't gangster like
