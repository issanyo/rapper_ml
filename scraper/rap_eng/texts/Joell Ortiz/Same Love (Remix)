[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Sorry mother, I don't mean to be this color
I don't mean for people who don't really mean it to call me brother
I don't mean to be harassed by undercovers or beat up
Like that trucker by them sucker ass police that one summer
Violated like they did to Louima in '97
Get my wallet confused for reachin' for my weapon
Or get killed after the bachelor party before my wedding
50 shots, not guilty in a New York Times heading
I told mom, "we movin' to a nice neighborhood, watch"
But even then, we not safe from the neighborhood watch
And there's a million other cases not as famous, the cops
Just lookin' more and more racist though they claimin' they not
We just a car full of minorites they waitin' to stop
Night stick action, when it's late and it's dark
Or just a bunch of bullseyes when they aimin' them Glocks
Why do I really feel I grew up on a dangerous block?
I think about it every night when I lie down
And the news kinda looks like a re-run with live sound
I'm not Puerto Rican speakin' on behalf of blacks
Look closer my people, I'm light brown... I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm [x4]

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots
Behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate
Yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same but that's not important
No freedom til we're equal
Damn right I support it

[Hook: Mary Lambert]

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause
Progress, so march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Till the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful
Some would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper
Isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us
We have to change us
Whatever god you believe in
We come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath, it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]

Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
