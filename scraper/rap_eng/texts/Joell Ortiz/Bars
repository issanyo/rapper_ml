[Verse]
Bars, bars, bars
I got y'all with those by far
Above par repertoire, bizarre
My assembles scar your garbage artists
Come learn who I are, it's the boy from PR
Brooklyn veteran, ex-drug peddling medicine by the jar
Turn booth super human, hear me roar
Start a stampede with YAOWA and a jungle, fuck a tar
Yeah, man, I fuck up the guitars
Beat up any drum barehanded like a paw
Million karat diamond rhyming trying to find a flaw
Better off trying to find an undiscovered dinosaur
And an unidentified flying object flying off
When they seeing  a yeti taking selfies all aboard
You niggas look bored, wanna see a monster? Well, come on
Sarom play the horn, I transform like Con
Edison, better than whatever you niggas is on
I can't stomach you niggas, kettle corn
You design an umbrella, can't weather the storm
I'm pure toxic, rain pouring in metal form
Magnetic maggots, out-rap you faggots
With the track playing backwards and the ProTools crashing
Why you look surprised like you don't know what happened
When Ortiz decided to do a little bit of rappin'?
Brainwaves blacking, anything whole in front of me turns fraction
Friction to fraction
Listen you freaking frat, you're no match when I'm spazzin'
So nigga fall back, hope you caught that
Anyway I'm back in my groove like a zipper
Move like a wizard, full of hot air in your balloon, it's a figment
Of your imagination, I'm smooth as the witch that gave Judy Ruby slippers
No place like home, booth and some liquor
Preferably Patron, nickels don't mixture
I'm out here getting money, I'm a bad honey twister
Fucking on somebody mother, niece or little sister
You niggas got hot, caused a few blisters
Those'll get popped every time I drop a sizzler
Man, you can't be serious acting like the Riddler
Dressing like Robin
Matter of fact like Robin after he left the 60's
As a young boy I wanted the Ac Vigor
Got a little older, wanted a black Six
I'm back to the act bigger
Not the car, I just act vigorous on my matte blaxk GSXR
Carry the .25, now my pat pats bigger
Clap you and detach that ligger-
Ment from the rest of your body, you mad disfigured
This album is gonna be dangerous, the artwork is a hazmat picture
But I don't wanna talk, I let the work speak
I make the internet flood when the verse leak
So motherfucker here I am
This next solo album for the fans, fuck a first week
