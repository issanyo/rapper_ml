[Intro]
These little groupies talk nigga
That's how you feel homeboy?
You don't want them kinda problems I'm trynna tell you man
No, you don't want that man
I'mma do this one joint, and I ain't talkin' no more: word to my mother

[Hook]
Beef is real on my side of town
Keep ya eye on all them put puts that ride around
Beef will provide all them siren sounds
Have ya moms with extra tear drops sliding down
Beef will have you relocating
But we gone catch up to you lil homie, we so patient
Beefs whatchu' don't want with me
No money on yo head, I get it for free
I hope you keep iron on you (2x)
You niggas act tough runnin' round with all them guards
Rich faggot niggas, ya'll ain't hard
I hope you keep iron on you (2x)
And you blow that

[Verse]
Ya'll must got me fucked up
I'm hood, I will fuck ya'll up
I'm signed to one nigga, that signed to Jimmy nigga and run with 3 niggas that can't be touched. (SLAUGHTERHOUSE)
But it ain't about all them bars now
I'm trynna let you know who I are now
This rap shit is ya'll dudes dreams?
This shit make my street doe clean, you get it
I had that dirty money commin' in
Coochie loonies, had my dudes with that stuff in the pin
I was really in that Comfort Inn
Bazooka Joe I was bubblin'
I'm a product of the Gutta fam
No bank accounts, Nike box and thick rubber bands
Before rap I was the peoples champ
Nothin' less than a 9 on that diesel stamp
Ya'll new jacks on the block
Gotta get the head nod to move crack in my spot
I was bootcamping that pot
And go in their soft, come out hard as a rock
Leave me out of all them rap beefs
Because I ainâ€™t finna write rhymes I'mma crack teeth
On camera y'all some mean goons
But a bunch of Powerpuff Girls in these green rooms
My finger itchin' on the trigger
Ya'll verified on Twitter, I'm verified by real niggas
Ain't they don't hashtag, they toe tag
Have me send a DM to ya folks pad
Can't walk through New York without a Yaowa
Or a chick trynna have me to herself for an half hour
I'm so not hard to find
I'm in the north side all the time

[Hook]
