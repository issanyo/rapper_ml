Yo
It ain't no fun if the Yaowa can't have none
It ain't no fun if the Yaowa can't have none
Problems with Ortiz, nah you don't want that
La-laugh in the mirror, yeah nigga fall back
I lost my marbles, lost my scruples, lost my bean
Lost my temper, losing everything, man I'm so lost flight 815
Look at how times flies, I'm 45 before 8:15
If I stays this mean, I'm a feel nine deep
In the 1 to the 993, I'mma make this cream

Style and flow in two thousand and four
I'mma take this scene by storm with a wave so mean
When I'm gone you can put everything I say in between two songs
That make the shape of a letter a J-O-E-L-L
Don't forget the second L, man, I hate when you spell it that way
Listen to the grapevine, man, I'm great, that should take time
Add another L, Lakers without Pau on the baseline
What the deal? Y'all want me give it real?
Want the shit to get killed? Want me to write it a will?
Oh, that's really how you feel? A'ight chill
I'mma let a couple spill from my grill
Bada bada feel, but I bought a meal
Suck a dick without a bill, undercover by my Bonneville
Saw the Silent Hill but not that (?) or the Jill
I ain't say a motherfuckin' thing but it sounded ill!
But this nigga will

[SEBASTIEN]
You don't know about Sebastien, and my passion for rappin
Get your head bashed in a bad fashion gon' happen
And get you laughin now get you cracking
Now f'in' to ask you without packin'
Will get you smacked in your face?

Then I suggest you relax
Nod your head to the track
Like you heard the best batch of Bodega
Don't get dumb bro, with the mumbo jumbo
I'm a violent mumbo like a track with Omega
Street Fighter without a scratch on me
Like I ain't never ever had a scrap with Vega
Ya listen to me and you listen to them
It's like PS4 goin' back to Sega

[Joell Ortiz]
Nigga shut up! You still play Sega nigga!

[Sebastien}
No I don't...

[Joell Ortiz]
Nigga you still play Genesis nigga!

[Sebastien]
No I don't...
