[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
Mmm, mmm, mmm, life takes some interestin' turns, don't it?
It's all good, just can't get off the road

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I ain't gon' lie, a lot of this is hard to take
I'm watchin' 'em praise the okay and overlook the great
I'm not sayin' that they ain't straight
I'm just sayin' that- nevermind
No matter what they gon' turn this shit into hate
So fuck it, let it alone
Headphones, dead in a zone like Rick and Michonne
I'm feelin' better on my own
Took a sec for me to accept that next time I'm on the road
Won't be no Crook, won't be no Royce, won't be no Joe
Just lookin' at the Hudson river right now, sittin' on the rocks feelin' like my reflection's life reflection, is it not?
Some people bought the ferry, other people dock a yacht
But the waves keep crashin' while the ducks just sit and watch
Sometimes, I daydream about me sittin' at the top
I see the clubs goin' crazy everytime my record drop
I see plaques on the wall and glass cases
For awards that I done got
Performin' for like a million a pop
The truth is, it's like one in a million to pop
And the only artists that really get the millions is Pop
Bein' simple is a yes and bein' skilled is a not
Havin' substance is lame, usin' substance is hot
So here I am still the hottest nigga in my barber shop
To get a number one but not that number one spot
I'm in a weird place, my fans don't expect me on the charts
Guess when you gifted, sometimes you rap yourself into a box

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
But still I jot
The way I put words together look complex so whatever
But still I jot
I'm just speakin' from my heart, my bad if I come off smart
I'm just tryna jot down a couple lines and see
If y'all like a couple of my rhymes as I-as I jot

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Four chicken wings fried hard with pork friend rice
Egg roll, two duck sauces will suffice
Fill my stomach up until it's time to get nice
Five sink cups, juice to chase it, a bag of ice
Whatever be decided, we gon' sip on that nice
Pocket full of work so fiends can come and get right
Two green, one red dice, you call a point through the weed smoke
Hammer underneath coat
That A-B'll lead to C ya later when that D-E choke
Just leave broke
Keep minutes on your cell, a sneaker box to dig in for your bail
And a team full of hitters who wouldn't tell
Wanna get it off quicker, then don't be stingy on that scale
Stuffed 'em, sandwich bags overpacked to twelve-twelves
Be on your fourth re before the first flip sells
That's the pre-music Joell
A Joell these check writin' executives don't really know well
I should win a Nobel
From carryin' my pieces to guardin' my prize possessions to Peace God, yeah, that was Marshall in my session
Now that I think about it, bring another bottle to my section
Let's celebrate that my apartment ain't from Section Eight no more
Ain't no more hungry nights
Momma, we don't wait no more
The First don't hold weight no more
I tell that waiter wait, no more
I gotta watch my figure, can't put on weight no more (Why?)
'Cause if I truly want a shot at the top I gotta drop
That's what they said
I guess I'll jog before I jot

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
The way I put words together look complex so whatever
But still I jot
I'm just speakin' from my heart, my bad if I come off smart
I'm just tryna jot down a couple lines and see
If y'all like a couple of my rhymes as I-as I jot

[Outro: Joellz Ortiz]
And there you have it
That all
Heh
