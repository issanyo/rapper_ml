[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
She say she love me and her mouth mean it
And her heart mean it
And her eyes mean it
But her mind leanin'
Toward the life she lived before me, often I'm seein'
Her mood switch up right before me when we're life dreamin'
Layin' our head, I'm seein' 4 years ahead
She seein' 4 years ago, wishin' she wasn't in this bed
Instead, she miss the club life, the pop bub' life
The life she used to love is fuckin' up our love life
It's tough cause I'm lookin' at her knowin' she the one like
Man... look how far we've come
All our friends say relationships are hard, we're numb
This natural high exceeds every single bar we've done
And I ain't tryna keep you home, baby, nah we young
But that departin' from them clubs at 4 AM when shorty's party done
Is a life that I watched your love part me from
I ain't tryna not be fun, just tryna grow

[Hook: Father Dude]
This song's for you
Even though we might be through when this song is through
Who woulda knew?
Who woulda knew?
This song's for you
Even though we might be through when this song is through
Who woulda knew?
Who woulda knew?

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Last time I checked, nobody checkin' on my ID
I'm grown, plus everybody know who I be
She comments on everything you post, I see
But I'm a G, I don't argue over IG
Told me you could handle my celebrity, but fight me
And question my integrity whenever someone likes me
If you don't like what you read then stop readin'
Baby I got an army to lead, I'm tweetin'
You worry 'bout my page, got me startin' to worry 'bout your age
They say it's just a number, I wonder if you behave
Like a grownup but miss makin' mistakes
Baby hold up, I'm just raisin' the stakes, but you know what?
When the weight of the world's on your shoulders it gets heavy
And too much brainstormin' could break the levee
But baby I'm here, I got so many ideas and I'm ready
I'm thinkin' you just love the idea of bein' ready, girl

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I'm preparin' for more, this house feels like a kitchen
You standin' at the door like this house feels like a prison
Used to fuck you on the terrace and let you look at the town
Now I fuck you on the terrace, feels like you lookin' around
Like the grass gets greener or maybe you miss smokin'
That green grass with Selena on the ave near the cleaners
Laughin', reminiscin' how y'all smash La Marina
With homie you used to smash with the stash in the Bimmer
Tryna change the scene as we chase this dream
Our relationship is in a league of its own
Cause I'm finally on my favorite team, let's embrace this thing
I'm tryna iron this shit out but am I wasting steam?
I feel like you wish the past was the present
The gift's in our future and you gon' fuck around and pass on the presents
What we have is a blessing
But it'll turn into somethin' we once had if we let it
Don't let it
