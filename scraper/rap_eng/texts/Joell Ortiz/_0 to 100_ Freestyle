[Intro:]
Ay yo, your man got work?
Damn man, nah my nigga ain't got shit either man
The fuck going on out here man?

[Verse 1:]
I go 0 to 100 nigga real quick
Keep it 100 man and 0 nigga, real shit
Like my favorite white girl went on a field trip
Can't nobody find her, when they do, that bitch is real hit
And they're still trynna charge a nigga 43
I mean 43, c'mon dog, this is me
My man said he's doin' a little special 38
Sell me that shake and bake, you'll meet my special .38
I don't play, I'm on the grind boy
Why the fuck y'all think I rhyme, when I wanna rhyme boy?
A nigga take his time boy
My boy is a Nine boy
Coffee grinds stamped rubber band
Grab a coffee , fiends spend their stamps
I'm poppin' rubber bands
House Boy, you ain't never leave the house boy
I'm out here with my gang
I ain't talking about the house boy
But they got some shit in common
Both rap niggas - some rhymin' some embalming
We can do it niggas
That language you tryin' talk
I speak it fluent, niggas
I'm in Ruth Chris with some ruthless niggas
They know they way around beef
Young gunners, like homey that used to stay around me
From the slums bro, don't be confused by the dumb flow
I still wire money down south to them gun shows
I just been sitting back, watching
Loading up a clip, pullin a fifth back, cockin'
Preparin' to feel like kickback
Plottin' on takin' my city back
All that chit-chat, stoppin'
Move left, disrespect, fuck a who's next?
Once I get to airin', all I care about who's left
Yooowaaa
Man, you lookin' at that powder
Rap's purest form, no soda no flour
Don't nobody want it one on one
Homey I'm a one of one
You all fucked up like a 1-0-1
Have my dog spot you like 101
Dot you with one, then drop you like summer buns
Don't fall back now, thought you wanted some
This is good sex to me
A whole bunch of fucking fun
Man, I do this with my eyes closed
I be on that pyrex with nothin' but that pyro
I ain't frontin' nigga, real shit
Yesterday I bought 500, nigga, real quick
Oh Lord, they like, 'why you still a hustler?
Same reason NBA niggas be at Rucker
A nigga love the game, real shit
I go from zero to a hundred, nigga
Real quick, real quick
