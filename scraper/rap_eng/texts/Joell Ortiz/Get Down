[Intro]
Get down, Yeaaah

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Ohh , wave at me baby I’m wavy
White Tee and yankee is navy
JOE L L, yeah I’m jiggling baby
Picking up ladies in the cinnamon Cedes
A1  flow I’m out here  getting this gravy
Steak out my crib, turn you into a Filet mignon
You ain't got [???], I’ve been lifting this eighty
I turn your selfie into a pic in The Daily
News know the rules, boy my city is crazy
Empire state with the liberty lady
The towers drop but  them twins still around
Twin Glocks fourtie or these twin four pounds
Who wanna dance I spin you around
Bring you back and kiss you goodbye with a round


[Hook: Joell Ortiz]
Ahh, now shorty how that sound
I know you’re from outta town round here
That’s how we get down
You’re in the city that shoot
Beside these bitches nothing really that cute
We get down
We don’t play at the [???]
One band two band shaking the spot
We get down
Ain't nothing bummy around here
Girlfriend we getting money around here
This is how we get down
Ain't nothing funny around here
Girlfriend a lot of money around here
This is how we get down


[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Anywhere I’m at is the turner (turner)
They scream turn down , I’m yelling  for what? (for what)
Winter time I turn the collar of my fur up
Summer time top down flipping birds up
Trying to tell these niggas, now I’m stunning on ‘em word up
Fuck it I’m that nigga when it comes to fucking words up
Move without security , and post on any curb yep
Tryina bust a move and watch the eagle lift a bird up
Any now I wanna lift a bird up
Break her off crazy have her shaking like a nerve suck
Looking at her in the corner all curled up
Gave her the Anaconda now its curled up
Pimp juice I should be Jheri curled up
Dripping from all this game that I’m kicking like the world cup

[Hook]

[Bridge]
It’s a whole lot money around here
Baby girl we get gully around here
I don’t know how they got down there
But trust me we get it popping around here

[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Pop up pop bottles and pop ya’ll ladies
Nah I don’t pop molly cause I get crazy
I pop they pop, them nines pop baby
Pop off , nah pap’s for real we don’t play, Paa!
I get it live so easy, nah I don’t mean do this for TV
But you see me

Having reappear in the Feegies in bikinis
You mad, you got it bad boy face facts
Do it big take a nice puff and tell her take that
