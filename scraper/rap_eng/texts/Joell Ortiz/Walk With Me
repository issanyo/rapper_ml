[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Walk with me, talk with me
Have some chicken, rice, beans, grab a fork with me
See the people watching awkwardly?
That's a mixture of Puerto Rico and New York City
Come on, rock an iron horse with me
Grab a ?, twist it up, have a cough with me
This that fuego so I know your voice hoarse with me
That's cool, ? go down awesomely
And our ladies, man, our ladies, they the best baby
Walk past you ? neck crazy
Man that's only in the morning when they dressed ?
In them heels, man it's real, you can see that thing jiggle every step, baby
I know it's hot but don't forget your heater
This that ?
? tripping like ?
And nobody ?

[Hook: The Whispers]
My city's like no other, ?
?
Crooked cops to the ?
We play
Take a walk with me, walk with me
Take a walk (X3) with me
My city's like no other, ?

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Walk with me, talk with me
Come on, play some dominoes on the porch with me
See that bridge? Come across for me

It's mad love, but I move around cautiously
Haters probably day dream about offing me
But you ain't taking nothing off of me
I tuck the Star Wars in my drawer, Skywalk in the force with me
? from the gut, baby

? you fucking crazy?
Get out the place, and then never see your face like the nanny from the muppet babies
Guess that's why I'm so real
In the rap game, try to keep my kind concealed
But my mind is filled with rhymes, lines, and skill
Clap for me, if I sign this deal I'm ill

[Hook]
