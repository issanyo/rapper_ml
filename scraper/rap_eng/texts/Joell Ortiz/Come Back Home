[Intro]
Lookin' sad and dreamy
Uh, my how the time had past
Lookin’ sad and dreamy
Wow
Just yesterday I was backflippin' on pissy matresses
Smokin' blunts under the fuckin’ slide in the park and shit
Wow
Uh

[Verse 1]
I scrolled through the 'Gram and seen old friends I hung wit'
Had a couple drinks, smoke blunts with, did dumb shit with
You know, slum shit, slung mix and rung fifths
Run quick, hop over gates, escape that one trip up North
I asked myself, "What'd I do so different?"
How did me and the younger me become so distant?
Or are we not?
Are there pieces of that block and parkin' lot parked up
Under this facade of a kid who made it out
But still feels trapped 'cause his bills stacked?
And Hip-Hop minoritize real Rap, that's real, rap
I purchase things and get alerts from my bankin' app
Like, boy, you ain’t supposed to be doin that
Who you think you is?
You ain’t never had no single on the charts
Only thing top forty about you is that new Glock
Sittin' up in your closet next to that old trap phone
You might have to pick both of those up and come back home

[Chorus]
Won’t you-you come back home
I need you-you to come back
Won't you-you come back home
Sometimes we go far and forget who we are and we gotta come back home
I need you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm one of the few that could say I made it out
But when I got out, did I do the things to make it count?
Did I invest, find some things to feed my bank account?
Or did I buy material shit that I coulda stayed without?
It's my time, I’m real ill, I'm 'bout to get mill mill's
You haters with ill will take chill pills, that ain't how I still feel
Thought I'd forever be a cash cow
But I ain't gonna cry over spilled milk
I keep it pushin', beat cookin', rep Brooklyn, give whoopings through the pen like it's summertime in the bookings
I'm lookin' off of these stages at faces that follow me through the Stages of my career and appreciate that I never staged it
What you see is what you get
What you hear is legit
I'm from the era you ain't shit 'less we feel you could spit
I've come to terms with the fact that I never might pop
Just glad my relevance ain't rely on if I ever went Pop

[Chorus]
Won't you-you come back home
I need you-you to come back
Won't you-you come back home
Sometimes we go far and forget who we are and we gotta come back home
I need you

[Outro]
I'm thankful for all that I have and all that I do not
I promise I won't lose sight
Came back home
