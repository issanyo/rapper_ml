[Intro]
Please don't hang around with me
Careful where I'm from, bruh
Don't play your games with me
Shit
I'm from that project right there in Brooklyn, Cooper
13th Buildin', 7 story high
But, oh boy, did they let it fly
And there we have it

[Verse 1]
I 'member the first time I gave someone a buck fifty
And they blood hit me
I was drunk, pissy, screamin, "boy, don't fuck wit' me"
A buck sixty wet, five-seven, but a threat
My boo step in Fifty-Four-Elevens through the 'jects
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
We smoke L's in the stairs, sip Cisco with thots
The best head was on a roof, that was top notch top
My Glock cocked
Bubble Goose, I move red tops
Nickels, five dollars a pop
5 for 20, they cop like clockwork
I cop work, get Kenny to chef it
R.I.P. to the best coke, Cookie a legend
A half a G of E&J and big bag of Frito Lays
Me no play
This jump off my hip, you DOA
See your way through my E's if you ain't from my hood
'Cause askin' for a buildin' number ain't good

[Chorus]
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that's us
Chillin' in front of the buildin', made a killin', drug dealin'
And we don't bust traps in front of children or old folk
We grown folk, villains
Tryna devise a plan to turn these grams into a million
I don't wanna be civilian
Too spoiled for a 9 to 5
Baby, I'm alive to be the guy my hood could idolize
I'm 'bout to buy the five, bring it to my guy
And get the stock rims, revitalized
Pop up out the car, watch like surprised, I buy a prize
Invite 'em with my team watchin' cable
Only time of servin' squares in my circle is at the table
Add 'em a lil' water, that Eve, I hit the block
Long as I got that 'caine, I'm able to flip the rock
I swear to god, I finger-fuck this fortyorty like we in a orgy
And have these bullets shakin' up whoever comin' for me
Sexy thot talk from a G that pulls strings
Like them old school forefinger joints, my name ring

[Chorus]
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot
Projectiles, the nighttime alarm clock on my block
I wonder who I left outside that might've got shot

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Real easy, real careful
Walk lightly through my hood
Hehe, word up
