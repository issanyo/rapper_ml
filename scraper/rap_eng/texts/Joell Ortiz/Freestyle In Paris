[Intro: Joell Ortiz]
One half of the bloodbath

[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse
Yo, broadcasting live from Babylon
Living like a million dollar don
It's Crooked, the phenomenon, rocking a vodka ron
Coupe fast as Ramadan
Treat Crenshaw like the Autobahn
I was born to be a beast in this musical octagon
It's like I'm the spawn of Chewbacca and Chaka Khan
Get out the way when you see a G flexin'
You pussies need to cut it out, you need a C-section
See it's No Limit, me and X at p n' e sessions
You can't even see me, I don't even see a reflection
They havin' dreams of beheadin' the champ
Take your best shot, them shooters you got better be Kevin Durant
Beretta, you can't, 187 your tramp
That Mac-11 lift you in the air, better than ramps
Whenever I'm amped, I go hard in the paint
No binders, a nigga better than me, sorry you won't find 'em
I'm mostly inspired by rappers who die, so rappers restin' in peace
They my ghostwriters and co-signers
In my low rider with the 4-5 call it Flo Rida
It makes hits so its on sight if I don't like ya
Even though your talk is cheap, I don't buy it
Die in my sleep, the only way I'll go quiet
You niggas so tired, was gonna fuck your bitch but I was so tired
So I decided to spray my name on her face and nut after a handjob
That signature move's the John Hancock
I keep the blam cocked, in case the shot'll have to welcome niggas to Jamrock
With one damn shot

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
And I ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
Bonjour, I'm on tour with the Slaughterhouse four and your whore behind me
I do some things with that paper sort of like origami
Got me shitting 'round the world like a porta potty
Don't try me I travel with a metal and pearl piece
That'll thunder at your hard head, I call it Metta World Peace
I could nonchalantly bomb your nonsense army
Your whole entourage be yellin' and screamin' like YA'LL THE SHIT
But I'm more pompous calmly
I wanted this shit from Atari
Started off kinda square like Nintendo, guess I was just trying to get my game on top
But that was the Genesis
Now that I'm super nice, I play on every station
And I go "Wii" in your X-box
Now look at me, trucking through with no rest stop
Cause I put my foot down motherfucker, step pop
So take your best shot at Eisenhower, man your rifle's sour
As Crooked I and Yaowa snipe you from ze Eiffel tower
