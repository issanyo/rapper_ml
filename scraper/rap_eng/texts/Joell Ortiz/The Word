[Intro: Joell Ortiz]

The fifteen year old, sixteen year old kid that cyphered on the block wants to battle
That guy in me wants to battle
The recording artist wants to stay out of that ring
I've always rapped with my back against the wall because I've wanted to knock down that invisible wall of "He's nice for a Puerto Rican"
I love it, I love it I'm proud to be, you know, what I am
But like when it comes to like this music thing like I think like since it's something just for the ears like I don't think people should look at it with their eyes
When it's all said and done and they bring up Joell Ortiz I want them to be like "Son was nice"
