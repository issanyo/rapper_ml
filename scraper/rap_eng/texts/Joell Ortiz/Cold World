[Intro: Lee Carr]
I got money on my head, man ain’t this a cold world
Man these suckers want me dead, damn it’s a cold world
‘Cause all I see is hate in their eyes as I rise they won’t need to fall
Man ain’t this a cold world

[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Sh-sh-shivering cold, f-f-frigid below
Z-z-zip up your coat, listen them niggas is froze
Oh but the di-digits you know, f-f-fifths will explode
Load that c-clip up and go, and if you li-lick it then glow
When you g-get it they hate, plot to g-get at your plate
They d-dinner ain’t steak, but papi this shit isn’t safe
They’ll find your c-crib through your plates, ye-ye-yeah they go there
Sh-show up from out of nowhere to tell you to strip out of your gear
Respect it, d-drop or get wet, d-don’t try to hide the Rolex
Come of those rocks on your neck, d-dig in your pockets then jet
B-better watch who you sexin’, b-be the opposite sex
L-l-linin’ you up after they m-mop you to death
Over the dollars you left, then gaspin’ tryin’ to get breath
Aspen climbin’ yo chest, you askin’ G-God what’s next
This how the story get told, k-keep warmin’ the cold
This is the hand you got d-dealt, you gon’ p-play it or f-fold

[Chorus: Lee Carr]
I got money on my head, man ain’t this a cold world
Man these suckers want me dead, damn ain’t this a cold world
‘Cause all I see is hate in their eyes as I rise they won’t need to fall
Man ain’t this a cold world

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Li-life in the street, we all t-tryin’ to eat
G-g-grinders’ for sweet, some grindin’ to f-find it for cheap
And learn to q-quietly creep, to dodge them guys on the beat
And dodgers dyin’ to keep b-bars made of iron your sleep
I know ‘cause I-I was in deep, my p-pop wasn’t sweet
On some n-nights it got so cold I provided the heat
P-peep my diary, weep. shh-shit that I did, shhh
Don’t tell them ‘bout the person you was a kid
I’m afraid of k-karma, man I’m just prayin’ my m-momma
I kn-know that you know I changed, but today and tomorrow
B-but it’s yesterday’s drama, g-got me stayin’ up longer
Scenarios p-play in my head, I b-became a monster
D-dressed in Satan’s armor, man do I th-thank you f-father
All my p-pain is gone, I called and you came for the Yaowa
But though I ain’t nothin’ to Feds, I ain’t p-pumped up with lead
Still I feel I got money on my head

[Hook: Lee Carr]
I got money on my head, man ain’t this a cold world
Man these suckers want me dead, man it’s a cold world
‘Cause all I see is hate in their eyes as I rise they won’t need to fall
Man ain’t this a cold world
