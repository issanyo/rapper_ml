[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
See you try to eavesdrop on the heat rocks
Please stop there's only one Ortiz, pop
I'm sort of like beat cops in the street
I walk around with a mean sixteen got
Jean drop off my ass where my cheeks stop
Newspaper feel snug cause you're me not
But I really hope you scheme not
Machines pop, how your body finna to drop like Detox
I'm one quarter of the slaughter and my team hot
A rubberband pop got my guap in a slingshot
And the ladies I see you looking
Ya party in Manhattan, don't wake up in Brooklyn
Yaowa, I'm pretty sure you heard that
This usually the sound before a verse that
Keep these rappers all timid when I speak
Let me end this like Dallas, I'm finished with the Heat, auh

[Hook]:
Feel so, feel so good [x3]
Feel to me, feel to me
Feel so, feel so good [x3]
Feel to me, feel to me

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
It's a bright sunny day
Think I bring a little money out to play
And finish up this, I put the six hundred away
Got the ring loud to their doors gone
I'm just looking at some booty
I park in front of the Gucci
Free those meet Louie, be thug in the
To anybody wishing they was us
Hating under their breath cause a whisper'll get 'em touched
New York niggas is tough like oak wood
The front of a Mustang we keep it so hood
We thorough, we clutch bangs and that whole woods
Stop your breathing, but this evening feel so good
So nah, I don't want the drama
I just met Tijuana
And there's no way her mouth could become my baby mama
I'mma stop into a Pilot, get a fresh cup and pick her brain
And get brain if it's cool she might get sexed up

[Hook]

[Outro: Joell Ortiz]
Please stop there's only one Ortiz spot
I'm one quarter of the Slaughter and my team hot
Please stop there's only one Ortiz spot
I'm one quarter of the Slaughter and my team hot
