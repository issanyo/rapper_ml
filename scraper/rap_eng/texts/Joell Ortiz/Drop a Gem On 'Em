I could drop a gem, they'd drop a dime if they could drop a stem
So trusting in these fiends'll have you saying "not again"
I don't care how long you know 'em, they watched you grow up
The thought of not having your shit, just makes 'em throw up
The last thing they wanna have to do is have to go up
And go cold turkey, eatin' cold turkey
So if cops jam him up then they could seem so worthy
"he got guns, he got tons", while they scream "don't hurt me"
And now they tryna hang you like Marino's jersey
And you don't even know it, the fiend won't even show it
He'll just walk up in your lobby like they did before
They don't care about your life and how your kid is four
Or 'bout how before you hit the block, how your fridge was poor
They just hustle up the gwap 'cause your nicks was raw
The moral of the story is: a fiend is a fiend
The person they was before is who they were when they was clean
