[Intro]
How did all of this trouble begin?
Livin' in America!
There's nothing wrong

[Verse 1]
Ahem, yeah, I hope this right here is the one
Before I say anything that offends you
I just wanna say, "fuck you and every male that you look up to"
Yo' daddy, brother, and uncle
Your basketball coach, the public school mascot
That used to hug you
That Pastor that butt-fucked you, holy shit
Yeah, holy shit
Who's the boney bitch you had livin' in the holy pic'
Clothes that don't really fit?
That's the new rap homie kit
Who's the boney bitch screamin', "I don't do this"
Then they blow the dick just like a pro
And spit like every hoe I know and shit
I off the top rope a bitch
Nikolai Volkoff a bitch
Grab my bulge a bit and tell a hoe to come cough on this
The headboard bangin' on the wall and shit
Neighbors bang on the wall and shit
'Cause I'm bangin' the walls and shit
Bangin' that off the wall and shit
For real, why that? Where that Barry White at?
I said I'm daddy in these blankets, baby leave that mic jack (Hehe)
I can't believe that she believed that I'd really be right back
Shit, what's her name again?

[Chorus]
Cocaine fingertips, when I get dumb, I get numb
Can't even feel the words on my tongue
Got them cocaine fingertips, you gon' be high as a kite as I recite the pure white that I write off these
Cocaine fingertips, this that in front of the store
What I'ma cut it for? It's all raw, boy
Them cocaine fingertips, yeah, that's some good shit

[Verse 2]
The nerve of anybody on this Earth that think they like me
I'm Godzilla in Japan way back in five-three, five-four
The raw fresh off the jaw, Loch ness monster on the high seas
Sometimes I ask myself, 'yo, where they find me?'
My mind be on Interstellar, extraterrestrial
Biochemical, celestial weaponry
I can think you into residue (Pew)
Don't even need the worst of me to get the best of you (You)
A couple healthy words from me and turns you vegetable
Any rapper is edible
I'll clap you off your pedestal
Pedal you on the back of my Vespa to an incredible desolate Desert location next to some sort of federal military installation
Install some more lead in you then make you write 'yaowah'
A million times in blood, legible (Do it again)
Some people say I'm not normal
No formal introduction needed 'cause if I see you, I am not cordial
Hold this fist across your head, that's how I forewarn you

[Chorus]
Cocaine fingertips, when I get dumb, I get numb
Can't even feel the words on my tongue
Got them cocaine fingertips, you gon' be high as a kite
As I recite the pure white that I write off these
Cocaine fingertips, this that in front of the store
What I'ma cut it for? It's all raw, boy
Them cocaine fingertips, yeah, that's some good shit

[Outro]
Yeah, bruh, that shit is-that shit is really potent, yo
