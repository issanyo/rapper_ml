[Intro]
Getting to old for this shit
Running from the police
OG said "go get a job"
Running from the police
You can't spend your whole life
Running from the police
Concreatures Shit

[Verse 1]
Cause it's maximum prison if I get caught with this package of Skittles
This for all my critters on the block with that mag on their britches
That be feeling like them cops with the badge is against them
Fresh out, released, go back in the system
When they get out the police go back where they flicked them
Six mob the street where the traffic be clicking
So them jump out boys stay hassling niggas
Grabbing their pistols yelling, "Freeze! Don't move!"
While you standing there looking, thinking please don't shoot
Either this booking's got to plead to a duece
Or beat him on foot, I'd rather flee and allude
And leave him in the dust, hit the gate, threw the Glock
Thinking that I must get away and not get caught
You can catch me if you can like the gingerbread man
Hit a bitch, trying to catch my second wind
Still running from the police

[Hook]
Cause my license is spun
All my niggas living life on the run
Still running from the police
Cause we got felony 1's
And we can never get our record expunged
So we running from the police
Mag and my uncle dodgers playing laser tag cops and robbers
Still running from the police
And Helicopters
We running from the police
Here come the coppers
We running from the police

[Verse 2]
Kept the burner had to throw the set
Wanted for triple murder and I ain't going back
When I get nervous, I cock the .40 back
It's the delivery man, but I ain't order that
It's out of my hands, I'm just a quarterback
Where I'm from, 52 grams will get you 40 flat
I write raps for niggas who write back
Doing life max, running laps on the back ???
Got sidetracked, tried sidestep
Made a side bet and the dice crapped
It's like that
Concreatures right back, with lead
What the fuck you said? I'll be right back
Then holler you down, Jay holler they style
Put you bitches to bed, no nightcap
My metro wiretapped
On the low from the feds like my dawg Black
Running from police
