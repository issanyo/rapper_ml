[Verse 1: Boldy James]
Damn, what happened to us?
When I wanted to stay, you didn't want me around
(What happened?)
Now that I want to leave, you be hunting me down
(What's wrong?)
Throwing shit up in my face, steady talking me down (It's cool)
Fuckin' with them lame-brains, that was on at the time
Now you want to take claims 'cause I'm talk of the town
On your Instagram page, trying to flaunt me around
Make me wish I could rewind back further in time
So I could turn the hands back to a quarter to nine
Nine years ago from the day, now my daughter, she five
And my baby boy one, that's my heart and my pride
You said it was fair exchange, but I call it a bribe
Tryin' to play the blame game but all of it's lies
And instead of pointing the finger, I point at the nine
Finna pop her but she had a doctor's appointment at nine
The tension was so thick, had me warring with minds
Got me considering divorcing my bride
Said she loved me and she won't

[Verse 2: Aaron Cohen]
Work hard, never rest
Shout to Khaled, but we the best
Angelina Jolie, get this off your chest
Used to shop at Ross, had to dress for less
Now I get free clothes, accidentally flex
It's never less than excellence
My whole squad sick, that's pestilence
Rap game, same shit as wrestling
Choose a back story, grab a corny outfit
Then strut around yappin' like you really 'bout shit
It's 2013, ain't givin' no vouchers
They say I just started, well, bitch, I've been out here
I live this, I breathe this, I sweat this, I bleed this
I want this, I need this like Kanye need Jesus
Like khakis need creases, my world fell to pieces
I stuck to my thesis, the realest, believe it

[Verse 3: Alexander Spit]
Uh, let's coast
A couple sirens in the cut gettin' their apple hole
As this scout watched and all beyond his vodka tone (Tone)
'Tone Rossi, shoot cannons like rocket launchers
Through the headlines, readin' that, a new dawn upon us
I redefine perilous scares who painted every line
We're here tonight with lyrics between (In between)
Now men get busy between whisky and head, yah
Flick of a finger, they call it flick of the table
We lookin' ice with that Andre, three stacks, ice cold
Unbuttoned button-ups to cuttin' some tight flows
The baby's pukin' off the side of the boat
The bitch is pukin' off the side of the yacht
Alexander on this system when they glide in your block
She kiss at me like a sailor when I arrive at the dock
Drop top, you got' watch with any sniper you got
Real window, Hitchcock, I know you dyin' to watch
Stay close
