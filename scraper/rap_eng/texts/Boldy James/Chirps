[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Bandidos, bandidos
Left pocket full of BBQ Fritos
Bandidos, bandidos
And this is not your cheese, bitch, Doritos
Bandidos, bandidos
Free Chi and R.I.P. Santino
My gambinos, for selling dinos
I got a pocket full of flamin' hot Cheetos
However you want it my nigga you can get it
I usually sell 'em whole, but for you I can split it
And cook it right in front of you, just give me 20 minutes
And that's gonna cost you if I gotta show you how I did it
Mixing baking soda with the yola, I'm a wizard
And my wrist game colder than an Oreo blizzard
Spend 15 O's out a quarter of a chicken
5 O's over that's an extra 10 big ones
If you really getting money, in Detroit we say you getting 'em
If you got it all on you, shit then where the fuck is it
Cause I don't fuck with no snitches
I keep most of my bidness
On the need to know and all you need to know is what's the ticket on a chirps

[Hook 2x]
(Kilos, birds, chickens, eagles, bricks)
(Kilos, birds, chickens, eagles, bricks)
(Hard, soft, however you want it nigga)
(Hard, soft, however you want it nigga)

[Verse 2]
I got them bandidos
And I been coppin soft, nigga you can ask Gino
R.I.P. E Flowers and Moschino
Been getting money in the park ask Bino
Free D-Lo, what up Cino
The whole crack spiff love me, ask lil B-O
And skito, remember me and little D-Bo
Used to live in house on mana behind the P-O
Or when I was in Boysville, paying the C-O
To sneak in morphine pills for me and Speedo
Cortez like "What you gonna do when you get free Bo?"
Buy 2 guns and another quarter a kilo
While y'all niggas is at Northlands, skating in trios
I was on the highway with a quarter a kilo
And I did it all my way, without Carlito
In the hood brick life and with that libo
And [?] selling chirps

[Hook 2x]
