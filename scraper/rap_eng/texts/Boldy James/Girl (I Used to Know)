[Verse 1: JMSN]
How you doing, how you been?
See you still got the same so called friends
But I ain’t judging, to me it’s nice
To know this is what you made your life

[Hook]
On the surface everything can look so nice
But if you meet the girl inside you might think twice
She’ll be your habit, yeah, your one and only vice
Don’t you know that everything you want comes with a price?

[Hook]
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
Girl I used to know
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her
It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Verse 2: JMSN]
Say what you want, say what you like
Her eyes will keep you up at night
No matter what you try to do
She’ll always have her hooks in you

[Hook]

It’s been a minute since I’ve seen her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
She ain't the same, actin' all brand new
Things will never be the same, she ain't the girl I knew
It's King James, it's true
Concreature, first they love you
Then they hate you, then they love you again

The girl I used to know, just another face
It’s the classic mix up, honest mistake
Looking at her picture, sitting by the lake
Ain’t seen her in a minute but we still conversate
On a platonic basis, cause’ it’s complicated
You and your friends been had a bad reputation
If I’m not mistaken, only thing I was chasing
Was a dollar and a dream, just trying to make it
Difference ‘tween me and them, I’m a gangster
I admit you had me whipped, dominatrix
Had to flip the script, lot of time was wasted
My time is money and I don’t got the patience
I could be flipping bricks, I’d rather pound the pavement
With my Concreature congressmen congregating
Presidential shit, call it Obamanation
That’s big spit pimp soup, real conversation

[Hook]
