[Hook]
Birds of a feather flock together and you winging it
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick
Quick, a 28 by 36
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick
Birds of a feather flock together and you winging it
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick
36 for the birds and I need a brick
Man this shit is for the birds and I need a brick

[Verse 1]
Blocks, I p-p-push it real good
In that salt and pepper Chevy with them woofers and them subs
On them spinderellas, I can hit the Kenwood
Remote and change the channel while I'm breaking down the bud
Smoking a perfecto, drinking on the bud
Finna roll another rello up and take it to the lungs
Pedaling that rego, racing through the slums
Pedal to the metal in a race against time
With nowhere to go but up, Bo on ?
Cause you damned if you do, I'm heading nowhere fast
And you damned if you don't, slow your role young man
'Fore you crash and you burn, I can't hold yo hand
Through this shit and ? better know yo ledge
Knowledge is the key to success, it's all in your head
Yea, to be or not to be, if you can see what I can see
As far as the eye can see, narcotic ?

[Verse 2]
Got 'em for 25, get 'em for 17
How he expect to fly if he don't ever spread his wings?
4-5 Desert Eagle with the beam
He talk fly, shoot him out the sky, clip his wings
Over a bird of 'caine, run up in your bird nest
Put 'em in yo bird brain and yo bird chest
Over that pack
What's the sense of putting all of your eggs in one basket if they don't hatch
Mother Goose and the old lady who lived in a shoe
Lining all my ducks in a row, duck, duck, goose
Red Bull and Grey Goose mixed with champagne
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
Where they let 'em fly and throw bullets instead of tantrums
In the hood, on the stoop, where them pigeons landed
Got them fruit loops, Toucan Sam
And put yo ass six feet like the old Jordan Jams cause
