[Intro]
Yea
Yo niggas come up to me all the time and shit man
Like yo, yo dawg where you be at?
You don’t be out here like that
Shit I’m like I be out here
I just don’t be in the spot y’all be in
I’m thinking of a whole different perspective homie
You thinking I’m in the club down the street
I’m halfway across the world dawg
Sipping some Bailey’s in Bangkok homie

[Verse 1]
Label me your favorite underdog as fly as every one of y’all
Niggas feel awake cause I don’t try to chill up under y’all
Spot a bad bitch and push up on her like a wonder bra
Run her and after I get some plays then I punt her off
Money’s my motivation but it can never rule me
Snakes slither like scotty with nino in that pussy
You ain’t fucking with yours truly
Grind me to the death
Like gunner man taking his last breath
Touching an uzi
Rock-a-bye baby
Why am I so shady?
Why is it when I visit yo bitch she goes crazy?
Couldn’t check this east side off of me if you paid me
Hernandez and I out to the cop car, yo they hate me
Dookie link with the cane hanging out the Derango
You be getting robbed, unchained, they call you Django
I don’t speak on Zimmerman, niggas know how the game goes
Skittles inside the barrel of his mouth, taste the rainbow

[Chorus]
Rappers come and go I’ll be posted here in the same spot
Murder me and we don’t be playing, letting the gangs pop
I’m a different fabric, yo we ain’t cut from the same cloth
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok
Bailey’s up in Bangkok?
Fuck, that was the gangs’ spot
I don’t do coke raps so I ain’t about the name drop
I be up in every single spot that you lames not
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok

[Verse 2]
Somebody better tell that fuck nigga to chill
I really know them streets, yo I know them niggas for real
You ain’t a killer you just around some niggas who kill
So don’t mistake yourself for a nigga that really will
You’s an OG groupie, but I’m respected by them
How you justify yourself being a low key floozy?
You living like a movie looking real goofy
Double barrel smoking like some twin doolies hanging from the ride
Banging by my side brought a line
Iron high transform
Columbine, type a tragedy up in your man’s dorm
Whiskey sipping, jack tripping spring up from the back seats clap beach
And turn the scenery to Jack Reacher
Real shit banging up out your speaker
Finger popping your broad until she leak
Then hook up the bra with the C cup
Fuck you looking crazy at me for?
Pass the weed bruh
Get your dough and cheese we softly divide the pizza

[Chorus]
Rappers come and go I’ll be posted here in the same spot
Murder me and we don’t be playing, letting the gangs pop
I’m a different fabric, yo we ain’t cut from the same cloth
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok
Bailey’s up in Bangkok?
Fuck, that was the gangs’ spot
I don’t do coke raps so I ain’t about the name drop
I be up in every single spot that you lames not
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok

[Verse 3]
I’m just another cat rapping from the east you should applaud me
Could have been pulling ‘raris on your mommy with a tommy
Instead I chose another route almost went to the army
Psychologically no telling how Uncle Sam would have harmed me
Was better of walking the streets
Dealing with beef
Chilling with heat
Bodies laying still in the sheets
Losing homies, feeling the grief
Busy fighting my war, mentally and physically
More focused than Clubber Lang, Rocky 3, Mr. T
Stand alone on my own, just me and my trusty grown
When its on, bullets dance around niggas like puffy cones
Shut the studio as quick as making the band
All on your head like Miguel when jumping over some fans
I am still the man, just more improved with a plan
Nothing to fuck with like the clan, you know, the Wu nigga
I been here who are you niggas
I barely can relate and vibe with all you new niggas

[Chorus]
Rappers come and go I’ll be posted here in the same spot
Murder me and we don’t be playing, letting the gangs pop
I’m a different fabric, yo we ain’t cut from the same cloth
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok
Bailey’s up in Bangkok?
Fuck, that was the gangs’ spot
I don’t do coke raps so I ain’t about the name drop
I be up in every single spot that you lames not
Tripping with some bitches while sipping Bailey’s in Bangkok
