Killin' the 5th as we smoke up the quarter
Feeling refreshed as a cold cup of water
Hittin' my chest, you the best and I can't lie
So don't be shy, open wide, baby say aah
Girlfriend ain't the first lady I made cry
I hurt her feelings but first I made her say aah

[Verse 1]
Oooh lala, imagine your wildest dreams coming true, voila
What it do mama, you got that ill na na
Foxy Brown, mixed with a lil Zsa Zsa
Wipe me down in the impala
No Benihana, Coach, Fendi, Prada
Just a whole lotta screamin' and hollerin'
And the thing about it I didn't need a dollar
Holla if you feel me mama
I know you kinda shy but I'mma get that out ya
Tried to told her before the night was over
I was gon get up out her now I got her open
Moanin', I be strokin'
Hittin' yo bay in a wave-like motion
Killin' it
Got her drippin' sweat
I know her man can twist he runnin' in the west
Or get it wet but I get it wetter
Niggas done hit before but I can hit it better
It's my pleasure

[Hook]
Killin' the 5th as we smoke up the quarter
Feeling refreshed as a cold cup of water
Hittin' my chest, you the best and I can't lie
So don't be shy, open wide, baby say aah
Girlfriend ain't the first lady I made cry
I hurt her feelings but first I made her say aah
I break hoes in half before I say bye
I Trey Songz they ass and make 'em say aah

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' sackchaser
When we fuck I put her in the back breaker
And break her, left her gasp faced
When she cum she run because she can't take it
Face it, I'm the best baby
One on one, she love me cause the sex crazy
Sweet lady, would you be my sweet love for a lifetime
Grind, it should be a crime
My hunny my bunny I love her cause the bitch crazy
But she mines, that's my baby
And she fine as wine, drive me crazy
Out my mind, that's my pastry
After we wine and dine, that's my danish
Down to ride, on the Daytons
In the trap with the stars and them straps, she Famous
Barker, Travis bang
