[Verse 1: Boldy James]
It's Concreatures, 'til I can't say it no more
With my Concreatures, interstate straight to the O
Rental car spinning with a cake taped in the door
I'm hitting your region, whipping h, weed and the blow
With my door, eat a nigga stay blazing the joe
I'm blazing the dro, while he play the Playstation
With my Macky on my lap, while the k in the floor
Stuffing baggies full of crack rock and yay on the stove
Just so happened I can rap and it's taking it's toll
The way that I'm ?, concreatures breaking the mold
The way that we roll, some gotta give on the up and up
Cause I got a deal to move this big o ain't nothing up
I ain't gotta deal, and them pigs know it's something up
But I'm not these niggas in this biz for a couple bucks
I got some niggas doing bids over 100 plus, plus I shot a nigga as a kid for 100 bucks

[Hook]
Throw yo 7's high, throw yo 6's low
If you from 7 mile, or McNichols road
Drug Zone, 6 mile raised
7 mile paid, neighbor gang (x2)

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
Just before the paragraph I indent with intent
Slung a quarterback and a half, six time what I spent
2 Deuce and a quarter with reds riding Envy's with tints
Young Detroiters gettin' cash, I extended my clip
Six and Hill block. Little Quarter mags and  swiss
Six to twelve shots, chilling on the crab with bricks
We still got quarters, halves and zips
350 for quarters, halves for 6
We still rock quarters, bagging nicks
Who pill popper snorting drags of this?
We deal spots, corners, aves and strips
We deal spots, corners, halves and scripts
I still cop quarter bags of chips
Used to steal pops from stores, bad as shit
I still quarts and halves from Chip
The deal block scorching ashy nick and ripple
On Hell block pouring Yac with Rec and Little
An deal cops who want my last and middle initial
To cell blocks with all my Stabs and Beans, We miss you
It's Hell block Boldy Chap from West McNichols

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Boldy James]
It's 4 quarters in a O
64 in a boat
36 a quarter crow
Brick of blow on 44
Times seven that's a brick
Miles 7 to the 6
Curtis Curve Curve
South Veal Service Drive
[Hook]
