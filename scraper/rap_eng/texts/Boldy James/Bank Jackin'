[Hook: Boldy James]
Cock the four pound, and the 74
Pull my mans down, like you ready to go?
Let off a couple rounds, soon as I hit the door
Everybody laid down, get down on the floor

[Verse 1: Czar Rae]
Don't do nothing stupid, you know what we here for
All the money is assured, we ain't got to kill folks
Don't be a tough guy, try not be a hero
Bitch you got your phone out, you think this a fucking joke
Boy I got the door, nigga just go get the dough
Slapped him in the head with the burner, just to let him know

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
Made an example out of him, had to fire the guard
Caught him reaching for the silent alarm
Hopped the counter on the teller, grab the bitch by the arms
Put the gun to her head, then I asked where the cash at?
And the safe deposit, boy show me the way
Cracked open the safe, duffle bag check
Cleaned out your accounts and your assets
And now it's time to bounce like a bad check

[Hook: Boldy James]
Cock the four pound, and the 74
Pull my mans down, like you ready to go?
Let off a couple rounds, soon as I hit the door
Everybody laid down, get down on the floor
Bank, bank, bank jacking
Straight, straight, straight jacking
Bank, bank, bank jacking
Everybody laid down, get down on the floor

[Verse 3: Czar Rae]
Three minutes and now we finished
Three minutes is in it for the Benjamins
Everybody in  they position

[Verse 4: Rick Rude]
Stolen getaway car,  peeping the scene
Two fully loaded carabine 15's
Looked up, two squad cars on the scene
Here come Boldy and C's with two bags of g's
This the shit that you see on a big screen
SWAT team, M16's
That's when I hopped out, and cut that chopper loose (blocka, blocka)
I know I hit a cop or two (blocka, blocka)

[Verse 5: Boldy James, (Czar Rae) & [Rick Rude]]
That's when I get to popping too
(blocks let's move I got you boo
Then we dove in the whip like a swimming pool)
As the glass shattered cause they was shooting at us
[Smash the gas pedal, now we Audi 5
In a Audi 5, all wheel drive]

[Hook: Boldy James]
Cock the four pound and the 74
Pull my mans down, like you ready to go?
Let off a couple rounds, soon as I hit the door
Everybody laid down, get down on the floor
Bank, bank, bank jacking
Straight, straight, straight jacking
Bank, bank, bank jacking
Everybody laid down, get down on the floor

[Verse 6: Rick Rude]
Ghetto bird out, and them news cameras
High speed chase and I'm a loose cannon
Man the cop cars quick, but we move faster
Caught a good down slide trip, move past it
Bolds telling me to drive, duke's a hazard

[Verse 7: Czar Rae, (Rick Rude) & Boldy James]
Man fuck this shit, I'm 'bout to do damage
I let a whole clip off, too scandalous
Out the back of the window like, you bastards
(Making love to the money is my true passion)
Sure, trying to stuff a hundred in my new mattress
Cause if the catch us they gon' send us to a new planet
I'm talking 'bout Jackson, no Janet
Hold this motherfucker steady Rude, don't crash it
Cause if this bitch lose control, we ???
Cop lights on the rearview flashing
Open up the bag it's a bad pack, blue magic

[Hook: Boldy James]
Cock the four pound and the 74
