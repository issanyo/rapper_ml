[Intro: Boldy James]
What else?
And send it up in flames
It's game time, it's time to kill the game
(It's only us) Light a match then you blow the joint
Blocks

[Verse 1: Boldy James]
Like sliding down a 50 foot razor blade
Landing into an alcohol river
They talk a good game, but they not at all killers
And my pain run deeper than Pac on malt liquor
I'm talking (Pain)
I lost my Uncle James to that Heroin
You never felt pain 'til you felt mine
Was too pressed for time
I had to stress to moms
Don't put up the house cause i'm a run
Just had my burn
A million ten percent
That's a honey bun
Niggas never been through shit so I don't feel them none
Cause pain is love and love is overrated
You only as good as your plug and money is the motivation
Champagne for the pain

[Hook: Boldy James]
No pain no gain
Watched it all go up in flames
And it left quick as it came

[Verse 2: Peechie Green]
First mistake that I really made
Fucking with these wishy washy niggas and their bitchy ways (Bitchy ways)
Jealous hearted even envied me
Wanted what I had and all I did was hustle constantly
Put my work in
Took everything for me the tenth time
Pussy niggas (All this [?] on me six times, bitch)
Got to grind like wine when I made mine
Name got hot in these streets when I bought mine
A real hustler push off anything (caine, blow, pills, weed, drank, I'm in every game)
The realest nigga since Jeezy
Nigga don't believe me shit I put that shit on Peechie
Champagne for the pain

[Hook: Boldy James]
No pain no gain
Watched it all go up in flames
And it left quick as it came
