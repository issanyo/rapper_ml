[Intro]

Roses are red, (yeah)
Violets are blue (concreatures)
When the roses are dead (Boldy blocks!)
I'd die for you (King James)
Detriot

She loves me
She loves me not
My love is deep
So I hug the Block

(Connie!)

[Verse 1]

You had me open, that's when you stole my heart
Then you broke it, now I need open heart
I quit smokin, but now I'm smokin carts
Drinkin whole fifths, because my sober thoughts
Full of emotion, you must have throwed me off
From being focused, cause seems like my focus off
You need a moment, now that we've grown apart
It's been too long for me to fix your lonely heart
But being broken, I sat alone in the dark
Singin' this song that I writ you that I wrote from the heart
But when I wrote this, you were gone now I'm lost
& heart broken, though I know in my heart I've gorwn
Went from being torn apart to Hulk Hogan
Mixed with the Incredible Hulk on such short notice
I tried but you don't want to talk
Now you want a divorce, I just want to be yours

[Chorous]

She loves me not
She loves me
She loves me not
My old lady steady bullshittin
Telling me to stop
But I'll leaver her ass before I leave this fuckin' block

She loves me
And you ain't got to love me
Cause if you don't, the block will hug me

She loves me
She loves me not
My love is deep
I hug the block

[Verse 2]

She loves me, when you don't
Connie does shit for me that I know that you won't
When I ask if you love me, you'll proabably say that you don't
Denying how you feel when you know that you do
Quit lying to yourself if you know that it's true
All the times we shared, this the moment of truth
Cause truth be told, I'm in love with you
But you did me wronger than two left shoes
And love is an emotion you can't choose
But since you chose, I've been stuck and glued
To what's under the soles of my 1's and 2's
You did a nigga bold left me so confused
She never did me wrong, I trusted you
And you left me in the cold, and crushed my grove
She put a nigga on, you cut my fuse
And took a nigga soul when you upped and moved

[Chorous]

[Verse 3] - Tennile

Baby I won't leave you
My eyes light up every time I see you
Low profile, GQ smooth
Your own style, nothing like these other street dudes
You different, that's why you the one
I was right there with you when you shot your first gun
Scared shitless, surprised you ain't run
Had nightmares with you, tossing in your bunk
Damn I miss you (They caught a nigga up)
All them nights spent with you, I'm falling in love
All over again, want to spend my life with you cause you more than a friend
And it feel right when you take hold of my hand
And the steel in the night, let go and you dead
If you get yourself bodies, I won't forget the times you stood by me
You my number one concreature
Love
Connie

P.S. The block
