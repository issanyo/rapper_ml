What's good my dude
Concreatures
Sig-Sauer boys

[Verse 1]
It's no success without struggle
That's why I hustle
Free Meechie and the fam
Thinkin' about what my cuzzo told me, this a jigsaw puzzle
And the pieces of a man is in the heart of the humble
Reach down and dig and you can tell who love you
Deep down within, unconditionally, unintentionally
If I gotta carry a gun every time we do a deal
Then there's trust issues with me, we agree to disagree
That's the difference between you and me
Anybody can be touched, some easier than others
We all we got and I'm my brother's keeper
We supposed to be brothers
Finders keepers, the life of a Concreature
It's losers weepers, move your feet or lose your seat
Ever since when fish ride bicycles

[Hook]
They like who that Concreature cool kid?
Ain't it obvious that he the coolest, cool it
He cold chillin' and krush groovin', coolin'
He the meanin' of what cool is, cool then
Cause cool is what cool does
And he was schoolin' y'all niggas on the schoolbus, foolin'
But don't get him confused with this music and do something stupid, doofus
He got ones and twos with checks and swooshes
Up next it's the honorary cool kid
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish
From black mags on the dino to a moped
Sunkissed movements jellyfish blowfish
In the Pyrex pot full of goldfish
One sip, two spliffs, three bricks, four trips
When fish ride bicycles go fish

[Verse 2]
No sin is greater than the next
Cause your own fam will play you to the left
When you do wrong for all the right reasons
The same niggas you feed will cater 'til your death
Impostors, they hate what they can't conquer
So they label you a threat
When they don't understand what angle you comin' from
They anglin' their guns at somebody momma ?
So respect who respect you
Until he disrespect you, then you show him otherwise
In a house of pain I became a man when I put aside my childish ways
And trust in the lord
If a man knows anything he realizes he knows nothing at all
It's just the luck of the draw, it was God who shuffled the deck
I'm just cuttin' the cards
