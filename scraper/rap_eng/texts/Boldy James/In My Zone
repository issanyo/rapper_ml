[Intro]

I chilled on Sugar Hill, Blue Hill
Cherry Hill, Murray Hill, Homby Hills
But until we get over the hill, niggah...

[Hook]

I've got sunshine in my pocket
I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tapedeck
I'm just moving right along
All these haters really love me
But pretending that they don't

I've got sunshine in my pocket
I'm just right here in my zone
In my zone (zone)
In my zone (zone)
In my zone (zone)
When I'm in my, When im in my zone

[Verse 1]

Where we at with it?
Been doing this since bales
Trumpets, drums, and carousels
Straight up and down, kept it parallel
But you can catch me in Detroit on the 6
Like bitch I'm Terry Mills

New V, only thing missing was a set of wheels
Got that cookie and OG, mixed with the [?]
Dodging these fake street niggas trying to catch every sale
Knowing deep down inside that these niggas scared of jail

No fairy tale
But until that little house on the prairie well run dry
Imma parasail
And set sail through the sky like a pair of quail
Or a set of turtledoves higher than a pair of hills

Turning up, living life at these heights
Can barely clear the rail
May not succeed at first in life
But can't be scared to fail
Don't nothing beat a failure but a try
Can barely spell, read or write
But I can sell green and white very well
Uniform full of stripes and I wear it very well
Just let me live my life and tare my scale

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

I got sunshine in my pocket
Duckin' one time in the projects
When my broski's on the front line
Quick to drumline with that chopper
With them hundros in them clippers
Watch them tumble when I flip them
I get money on sieta and the drugs on [?]

Used to hustle off of Pickford
Double cup full of elixer
I love pistols when they standard
And my kush rolled in a swisher
Saw my gang on MTV Jams, face looking bitter
Now that's Boldy James on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter

It took them by surprise on JMSN Pricilla
You can look me in my eyes and see the face of a killer
B done took them for that ride, no trace of a squealer
Unorthodox as Raekwon, Ghostface and RZA
Sip sippin' on some sizzurp, servin' coke sniffers
Burning Space Ghost Purp, You can call me Smoke DZA
Cause it's 227
Me and my hitters tote thrillers mo' triller
Just opened up on Bentler and I got sunshine

[Hook]
