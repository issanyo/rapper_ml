I'mma be the first one up
When the sun come up, boy, I'm getting that cheese
I'mma be the last one down
The first one on the block and the last to leave
Gonna get that, gotta go get that money
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money
I'mma take what the block got for me
Gonna get that, gotta go get that money

It's Boldy J, shout out to my nigga Tray Forway
The man in the middle 'cause he oughta brought his money
That do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do, Bisy Bambino
That I got a big ego
I'm tow up on the floor up and I came up from the bottom
So don't show up when I blow up
Too late 'cause you already blew me, my Toronto Blue Jays
Got ' white stich, Carolina Blue Jays, lose kush, indictments
Carolina Blue Jays, yeah, I'm talking of oxys and rocksys and the blue flame
Moving them things, running through the change
They had a decent night sleep last few days but

I'mma be the first one up
When the sun come up, boy, I'm getting that cheese
I'mma be the last one down
The first one on the block and the last to leave
Gonna get that, gotta go get that money
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money
I'mma take what the block got for me
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money

I go and get mine, never looking for no hand downs
Fucking with the mafia so you know we brought them bands out
You might catch me with your bitch, I'm whipping, she got her pants down
Already hit the pussy and she bout to get me head now
Everything I know ain't good but it's all bad
Doing good enough to hit the mall, spend it all on credit cards
Just show up cash, you say buck, only dash to the money
As fast as I'm spend it I'mma get it back
No income tax, we sipping, leaning, smoking trash
Holding them bitches back to back, fucking these bitches good
So when they leave I got 'em calling back
I'mma mack like goldie, bitch act like you know me

I'mma be the first one up
When the sun come up, boy, I'm getting that cheese
I'mma be the last one down
The first one on the block and the last to leave
Gonna get that, gotta go get that money
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money
I'mma take what the block got for me
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money

Cash, I'm about my business
For the cash I be chasing, not a lot of friendships
Wife ain't franks and them 20s that PG
Got 50 different hustles, can't shit out, speak me
Jumped off the ' momma couldn't buy a birdie
300 on the curve where the boys serve
Big bank hate, man, I get it good
Fans blowing with your girl on my dick, she a drooler
Had to get the bag 'cause my pockets was too full
'going to the crib, sun out till it burst out
18 old trip, 20 000, boy

I'mma be the first one up
When the sun come up, boy, I'm getting that cheese
I'mma be the last one down
The first one on the block and the last to leave
Gonna get that, gotta go get that money
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money
I'mma take what the block got for me
Gonna get that, I gotta go get that money
