[Chorus]
Walked in this bitch, man we trying to fuck it up
I’m losing my section man we came to bust it up
Glock on my hip, so they won’t catch me slipping
We ain’t fucking with you niggas, man we trying to get these bitches
The dope man had to take some time out the kitchen
The dope man had to take some time out the kitchen
We ain’t fucking with you niggas we came for the bitches
We ain't fucking with you niggas we came for these bitches

[Verse 1]
Ice sauce dripping fresh up out the pot boy
Small talking won’t get you far boy
Put my arm in the top and whip it
Like a broke stove in the kitchen
Hey i came down like a riding slab
But i came out like a situation
We use to split five at the tennis court
Now we going to drop the top up in the leisure
Hey i walk in with beef in the lighter man
And now we about to get a 100 grand
I need a mill plus a hundred more
Rest sent straight to the floor
Hey she love the way that we be flexing
Light skin ass fat in houston Texas
Now I’m on a lean like a country seal
Now I’m on a lean like i cracked the ceiling
Open this bitch baby I’m trying to fuck it out
Norkles in my section man yea we trying to bust it up
Locked on my hips so they won’t catch me
Fucking with you niggers I’m trying to fuck these bitches
Dope man had to take some time off kitchen
Dope man had to take some time off kitchen
We ain’t fucking with you man I’m trying to get these bitches
We just fucking with you nigga we just came for these bitches ass
I was 400 degrees fresh out the juvi
Running through bagging for  a 100
I would have killed
Store Tyre rear hot block on fire
100 G’s at the top spot set off admire
Break dance the whole bag in a heartbeat
Posted up in the track while strapped in the car seat
Screamiong free my nigga puple game rule Bruno
In the kitchen wrist flick
Trying to roll me up a huge blow
With six game chain wrist game
Hurricane cane Hugo sipping all this drain
Got me somewhere up in pluto
Mix the water with the soda
The starter got the others where they got me
Yo all day lookin dope like my aunt molly
My wrist rollin trips talking four five six
It's a ladies night break the ice
On the dice right quick like your wife think twice
I don't like that shit
Spilling activist drips on my all white fits
I had the ball white 10’s
The clocks in all white 10’s
The four door side on my daughter all white benz
Cause i got you a job i hope you good with your hands
I just tossed you a lot now pay me back when you can
Eggs in the pans she’s greasing the pot
I burn on low i don't want to burn down your house
Just toaster in the juice pancake in the box
Girl can you really cook or we ordering out

[Chorus]
Walked in this bitch and we trying to fuck it up
I’m losing my section man I’m trying to bust it up
Glocks on my hips so they won’t catch me slipping
I ain’t fucking with you man I’m trying to get these bitches
The dope man had to take some time off kitchen
The dope man had to take some time off kitchen
We ain’t fucking with you man I’m trying to get these bitches
We just fucking with you nigga we just came for these bitches ass
From the whipping [x5]
