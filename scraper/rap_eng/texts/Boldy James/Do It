[Intro: Boldy James]
Where we at wit it?
Block
227
Whateva

[Chorus: Ricoelite] (x2)
Do it (x8)
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it

[Verse 1: Boldy James]
I do it
Ran it up and I blew it
Put a one on the 126 finna 252 it
Pullin' up in my Buick
454 big blockin' on the open road no pit stoppin'
No this ain't my first rodeo no a nigga like me been poppin'
In the hood gettin' to it
No Sprite had to Mountain Dew it
Chopped it up finna screw it
'Fore you can get yo hands on it I dun already ran through it
Nigga hit me back said his man wanted pump fakin' already knew it
So I turned the bitch back around
Know I had to Michigan U it
Unc taught me how to put them bricks together so I had to redo it
Mix it down and EQ it
On 6 Mile runnin' through it
Thirty-twos on the Dually truck got yo baby momma wanna do it
Let's get it

[Chorus: Ricoelite] (x2)
Do it (x8)
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it

[Verse 2: Boldy James]
I did it
I done it
I got it
I had it
I get it
I run it up
I run it up
I stack it
I'm in a whole 'notha bracket
Skull and bone on the jacket
Twenty-twos on the benz ooh
Color coded to match it
Only fuck with hoes that's attractive
From a centerfold or a [?]
Got a bad bitch with a bad bitch in the studio gettin' graphic
Hunned thou tucked in the mattress
All the plug needed was an address
Cookin' up a bricky in some holy water got me feelin' like I'm John the Baptist
When it come to this trap shit, I'm the landlord
Just sold a half brick, on my Android
Got rid of my bad phone, duckin' from the Elroys
Hit it with the lactose now a nigga pockets on steroids
Let's get it

[Chorus: Ricoelite] (x2)
Do it (x8)
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it
If I said it I'ma do it
Gotta get the [?] do it
