[Intro]
This the type of shit you gotta have your shit on point for
SG please excuse the delay, you know it take time for perfection
And we do strive for perfection, yeah
Ab solar system (clears throat)

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I got dreams, I got goals
Aspirations of plaques that are platinum and gold
This is fact, not for show
This is actually happening, I'll have you know
I mastered my craft
Faster than average lapping you slowpokes I'm after the cash
Cause Soulo is so broke that I need a cast
Please understand this ain't quite what it may seem
This rap shit ain't all that it's cracked up to be
So until my name ring like the Liberty Bell, I'mma raise hell
It rains and it pours so much it could fill a well
And I know that well, and if you don't then oh well
Got a dime of kush, tryna [?] the tree
Like the hotel
A blunt to the face only time I take a L
And I never fell even if I slip and fall
I get up, dust myself off and pick up where I left off
You know what

[Hook]
I got too much heart to stop and give up my dreams, so I won't
And I refuse to let you tell me that I can't so I don't
I've been struggling, tryna see it see it 'til end and I will
Cause it's evident
I can't stop, I won't stop, I can't stop enough

[Verse 2: K-Boy]
They keep on whining, I keep on grinding
Stacking this paper then get up my shining
I know the sunshine right after the rain
Deal with the pain and I never complain
Born in the struggle, my mind is a muscle
I go so hard with the grind and the hustle
Learn in this game not to screw up the biz
This ain't about me, I just do for my kids
Work and no play, got no time for no hoes
I'm set so I'm tryna accomplish my goals
Love for the craft but its all for the cream
Stress on my back, tryna build up my team
Niggas gon' hate but, shit most of 'em fake
I pay it no mind, I just stack up my cake
Don't know how to fail, homie that ain't my thing
But better believe I'mma get to my dream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tone Trump]
Lil' nigga with a dream like Dr. King
I want the fancy cars, I wanna rock the bling
I want the pretty girls, I want the big house
I want my momma living somewhere far way out
I want my going to school with the whities
I want a sneaker deal, somebody call Nike
I wanna shoot movies, somebody call Spike Lee
This for the kids in the ghetto just like me
If you want it then get it, you gotta work for it
I wouldn't want it if I didn't have to work for it
So I grind and I push then I push some more
I ain't in but I'm right at the front door
You know you close when the haters start hating
You know you close when the real start faking
I keep a law first and I go hard
I came from nothing, it's only right I show off

[Hook]
