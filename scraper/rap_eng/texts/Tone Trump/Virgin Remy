While you run base like the ballpark hiestes
I put that grip to your head like tyson
And take half off like walmart prices

These rev run bullets that will lift your ass up
Until the cops come caprisun sip your ass up
And i can tell niggas is mad that
Your new shit is chicken pox nigga i had that

[Verse 2 Tone Trump]
I put that on my city i put on for my city
The west side of philly man i run that shit like diddy
In a porsche banging biggie i put that on my bitch weave
Little thick blonde bitch she like a young eve
They love tony they hate tony
I dont give a fuck as long as i get cake homey
All about the grind kill them downsouth
Five features yesterday i survive in a drought
Trying to black ball a nigga i survived all about
Put my name in they head they kept my name in they mouth
Twenty mill made off the street rest in peace to the ones i weep
Live family like hov and bleek
See im all about my money im all about my paper
S five fifty balling on you haters
Came from the bottom so i reaching for the top
Fifty fourth and market man im speaking for the block
Talk alot of shit but we not speaking to the cops
Niggas reach for the chain i each for the Glock
Tattoo tears my brother doing years
So it ain't just me i have to get it for his kids lets win

Hook 2x
Boy i put that on my city
Put that on my bitch weave that its remy
God Forgive all the real niggas die
Then i bet my heart stop
