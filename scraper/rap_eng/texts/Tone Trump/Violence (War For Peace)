Boy, violence
Violence
Boy, violence
Violence
Boy, violence
Violence

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Niggas comin' through with that violence
Niggas mix two with that Molly
Ain't got nothin' to do with that money
I'm comin' through with that chopper
Niggas come and deal with that violence
As far that gun that's silence
Niggas come and deal with that violence
Ain't know nothin' about it
Come through and we redrum-ing
Murder a nigga off of that donkey
If it ain't nothin' funny 'bout money
Look fuck nigga get money
In my car and I self park it
Hop out then get to sparkin'
Give it to however you want it
I am 2pac for the moment

[Hook]
Violence
Got no love, violence
Boy, violence
Violence

[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
See we are, far from takin' flicks with guns
I murder the beat with the sticks and drums
Break bread with brothers, turnin' bricks to crumbs
Then we put it in the mix to addict the young
This is somethin' you must understand
Music can just kill a man
A mean poker face and wild card in my hand
Tone Trump out of Phila-stan

[Verse 3: Tone Trump]
Middle of the summer we don't chill
Them West Philly mahfuckers kill at will
Fresh Prince of the ghetto man I feel like Will
Only workin' three jobs just to pay them bills
I could kill 'em with the gun rather kill 'em with my mind
My little sister pregnant but my brother doing time
My baby boy squeal but my baby mom stressin'
I only fear Allah but the uzi on the dresser
Bang, bang like my hittas from the Chi
Niggas looking rich but they barely getting by
We was selling crack when they was selling lies
Al my young bulls violent, you can see it in their eyes
I stood tall when that fuckboy folded
I'm sober now but I was high when I wrote this
Dreams like Martin but I'm strapped like Malcolm
My plug from the A got me ballin' like a Falcon

[Hook]
Violence
Got no love, iolence
Boy, violence
Violence
Boy

[Bridge: Cee-Lo Green]
Say, say
I'll write a life sentence on a stick pen
Real rappers record on yellow tape then
Cop a plea all the [?]
Institution that allows it to make men
[?]
Gon' turn it up for the cops too
It's still a crime to be silent
So speak up and get violent if you got to

[Hook]
Violence
Got no love, violence
Boy, Violence
Violence
