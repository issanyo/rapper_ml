I flip work, get money, rock ice
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
Base surfin, white keys, 2 in the shoe box, spike lee
Ever paid 60 bands for some nikeys
Stacked in the closet like them white keys
Hunneds on the floor, shit looking like a rug
Know it’s fucking money, cause it’s smellin like the drugs
Asking my young, he a highway leter
Get him right to your door, with your cuff more set up
Rolex today, rock the audemar tomorrow
Bentley today, I’m in my other car tomorrow
Let the key to my rolie off in my new Bentley
Chopper on the back seat of my new Bentley
Versace be the frame, yeah the fam know the name
Pyrex king, what I be without the cane
Dope boy cashed out, it’s the world how I feel
Bullet be the corner vet, cardie windshields

I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is

On the corner bagging up, that’s what I call a multitask
Real grooving, drop bands and make the rollie dance
Killers on standby, we winning by a landslide
If somebody called you different
They just told a damn lie
Big face, ill tie, with a couple rubber bands
Same place all summer, call this shit the summer camp
Came off of the puff, just swear like it was 2 of me
Now you see how one, got on all this jewelry
I came up, now these hoes fuck with me
I’m like flight that, you ain’t come up with me
Copin so much ice, thinking like what’s up with me
It’s time to do it young, cause I wanna touch 50
Cd’s plus, vd’s plus, cte and d, that’s what’s with us
Weapons, bang time, come on
Everybody throw your fucking gang signs

I flip work, get money, rock ice

I flip work, get money, rock is
Throwing up gang signs, mob life

Throwing up gang signs, mob life
I flip work, get money, rock is

I’m the man you can’t deny
You reed away like a dike
Blowing kush out the roof
In my coupe with no lights
Gotta stunt, can’t be the only one
That’s in the crew ice
Bend the lot, but the faces on them haters was criss
Gimick get excited, I’m kinda important
I don’t fuck with no… they might be informers
I’ma real good, I’ma give you this warning
Not a good but I’d rather point your fan to be more
Couple guap, couple play it cool
On the road to the mill and I ain’t go to school
Foreign shoes, foreign whip with a foreign
Young, getting money like this ain’t my fix
Balling like the 60 second paper, getting to it
Why you talking bout a bag when you can’t move it
Do it like nike cause we want a check
Gold boys cash out, fore reals
