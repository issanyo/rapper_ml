[Chorus - Jeezy]
Copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Jus copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before

[Verse - Lil Cory]
New ride, suicide, Ima fly at ya haters
Supa fly, do or die, gotta try to get my paper
Gettin money everyday, yea it's feelin like the lotto
Don't talk no shit, empty the clips of the semi auto
I'm takin trips in my whip or chillin in tha grotto
Fuck you bitch this my shit call it grand theft auto
Get it how you live, yea that is always been my motto
Why the hell would I need hoodrats if I got the models?
Family turnt they back on me, hommie slipped some crack on me
People want me dead I heard ya homeboy put a stack on me
No longer am I trafficking bricks on the triple beam
They ask me what is happening, so I tell 'em everything

[Chorus - Jeezy]
Copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Jus copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow

[Verse - Lil Cory]
Look around what you see? Bunch of fakes on TV, when it's me you should see. Hypnotized in ya mind giving signs to the blind in a world that is cold, I'm of men of old. Power and glory, still no one know
Honor and bliss long been dismissed far from the days when fame wasn't shit. Now in the days when fame giving hits yall people is tricked thinkin fame give ya this, they give ya that. Feel this is it. Blood in my veins and it's colder than rain in a world full of pain used to be safe. Female gender's lost they consensus, losing they senses, losing they mind's to niggas that's ignorant. Tired of the drama, tired of the bullshit. If I could go back I would lose my existence
We losing allot refusing to stop, infusing the thoughts that we had at the top. Time don't exist to a man jus like this. Make ya ball up ya fist, yall lookin pissed. Gnashing your teeth findin reasons to beef instead of seekin a reason to seek. Yall so naive yall believe in deceit. Go ahead sell your soul but don't ask for receipts

[Chorus - Jeezy]
Copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Jus copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow

[Verse - Lil Cory]
My mind ain't gone, it's jus a lil off track
Ya fuckin around with me and I'm breathing fire down your back
24/7 man I'm on this new grind
20-12 waiting on the planets to align
Got beef wit me? Bruh na you can't hide it
Ima be comin into your kingdom like Ima Somalian pirate
Got my choice between grenades, the hammers, and the AKs
Put my muddy feet up on yo couch bitch I am Rick James
[Chorus - Jeezy]
Copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
Jus copped the new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash
Now that's Thug Motivation for your mutha fuckin' ass
Ain't nothin' to a G, shit I been here before
MR. 17.5, ya damn right it's gon' snow
