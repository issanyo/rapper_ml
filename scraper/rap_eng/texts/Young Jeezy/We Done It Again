[Intro]
Uh uh uh yeah
Every ghetto in the world...
Y'all feel me out there? (World)
You gon feel me (world)
Every ghetto in the world...

[Hook]
This for every ghetto in the world
Every little boy, little girl
I don't know you but I feel your pain
So for real I'm making it rain
We waiting on a savior, maybe Barack
Cop a new drop head that's missing the top
It's us against the world, we playing to win
We done it again

[Verse 1]
What the hell's going on this evening?
Feeling like Trayvon Martin, I'm barely breathing
On my back, looking into the eyes of my killer
You can take my life, but I'm still that nigga
What does Romney know about my ghetto to say the least?
Last time your partner got killed over a Caprice
Tell me thats the cost of life, a box Chevy
Make you wanna call Katrina up - Who broke the levy?
Got nothing but love for New Orleans they bounced back
See first the water came in and left just like that
See one thing about my people we got pride
See we work 'til we got laid off and not fired
GM go bankrupt, we out of work
That'll drive a single father in Detroit straight berserk
When you can't feed your family and kids, what's the solution?
Only one word for that: a Revolution (Shit)
Now Chi-Town looking like a war zone
Like they went to Afghan and brought the war home
When all the penitentiaries packed just like the club
And its supposed to be the land of the free, at least it was
99% of the country - they in debt
Trillion dollar deficit, nigga that's a definite
Got two words for that, thats just duty
Can't fix in one term what Bush fucked up in 2 (What?)

[Hook]
