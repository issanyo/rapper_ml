I'm in my Cool Whip, inside's Jello
Hop up out that pretty muthafucka like hello
(Hello) Hello, ladies how you doing
That nigga crazy girl, don't say nothin to him
They know they know I got white low low
Rob who, take what (gun cocks) hello
They know I give a fuck about them haters
Young jizzle been getting paper
Granite, wheels on the coup like savors
Hit da club with twenty broads like Flava
I'm on the top floor no neighbors
Who you kidding I get my 87's tailored
