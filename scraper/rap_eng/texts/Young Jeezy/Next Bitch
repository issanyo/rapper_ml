[Bridge: Jeezy]
Said bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Skeeting ain't fucking, you know I'mma leave 'em
If ya want the whole thing, nigga, holla at my people
Black boy, white girl, I ain't talking jungle fever
Pussy nigga, what's up?

[Verse 1: YG]
Uh, I still love my ex bitch
But now I'm on to the next bitch
The only time you gettin' a text, bitch
Is when a nigga need some sex, bitch
So much paper, hoodie custom alligator
I fuck, she said she was pregnant two months later
Uh, eighteen years with her, I wasn't with it
Like Doughboyz, I had to cash out at the clinic, woah

[Hook: HBK]
I still love my ex bitch, but it's on to the next bitch
I said I still love my ex bitch, but it's on to the next bitch
I still love my ex bitch, but it's on to the next bitch
I said I still love my ex bitch, but it's on to the next bitch

[Verse 2: Doughboy Dre]
I still love my ex bitch
Even though that bitch ain't shit
40 cal, got a 30 clip
Don't play boy, I let it rip
Doughboyz, yeah we in this bitch
Been getting money since '06
Dolce shoes with the matching shirt
Whole city know who got that work
While you bitch ass niggas hurt
I be ballin' cause I want to
Do it with finesse
All these gold chains just hanging from my neck
Quis in a vet, I'm in a Range
Grab my bitch a bracelet and Chaz grab the chain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Payroll]
Louis jacket with the sweats, bitch
Left wrist VS1 infested
Jesus piece on, I'm a blessing
Now my ice game sick like my ex bitch
I don't give a fuck about a ho
If I was broke, shit, I couldn't get a buck up out the ho
I need one with good credit, get a truck up out the ho
I don't catch no feelings, I don't suffer by the ho
Bought a pad in the burbs, but I moved out quick
Cause you around niggas I done had shootouts with (dirty bitch)
And you wonder why they call you bitch
Cause the respect I had for you, you done lost the shit, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Doughboy Quis]
20 thousand on my tummy, now she money hungry
See that a nigga eating, now she swear she love me
And think of me when I ain't had nowhere to stay
Now I'm hanging out with Jeezy, riding foreigns in the A
Sippin' Perrier Jouet with my brand new wifey
And we got matching rollies like my parents in the '90s
I keep her right beside me, I know I got a bad bitch
Anything she want, I swear to God I'mma cash it
That broke shit is past tense, nigga, I'mma boss
Everyday she get a gift like I'm Santa Claus
I'm lost with you, but I'm winning with her
In the winter, matching furs, with a crib in the burbs

[Hook]

(Pussy nigga, what's up?)
The only time you gettin' a text, bitch
Is when a nigga need some sex, bitch
