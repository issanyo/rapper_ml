[Intro: Akelee]
Have mercy on my soul, shine on

[Hook: Akelee]
Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
First off I wanna apologize
Every time I made my momma cry
Leaving these pussy ass niggas traumatized
All the bad names I called ya when Lil Bleek and Lil Ivy died
Blessed me over and over again
The more he blessed me the more I would sin
Guess I was moving too fast in the wind
Got tied and pulled my ass in the pin
Now I'm looking at the past, thinking 'bout the future
Glad I got another chance, see ya feeling's mutual
Protect me in the streets when the times got crucial
When niggas slung iron, you made me blind to the shooters
And now I'm all alone and I'm calling on you daily
Asking for forgiveness and I'm asking you to save me
Protect my T-lady, don't stress my old lady
And you and I know how much I love my seven babies (alright I'm sorry)

[Hook: Akelee]
Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Thinking 'bout them nights that my momma cried
Only son since my only brother died
Surgery on surgery, I can feel the pain
Have mercy on the Lord, please don't let her hurt again
God you blessed my auntie Brenda be the living proof
Had a tumor in the brain size of a grapefruit
It's for them ghetto saviors that's living major
Now they missing like the flight 370 to Malaysia
We was skinning and grinning, thought we was winning
Heard it's hot in hell so I'm packing linen
And lately my conscience be shaking me, waking me right up out my sleep
Keeping it 100 I ain't sleep in 'bout a week, hey look
Gotta do it for my little cousin, Chastity
See her boyfriend took her life
When I think about the daughter that she left behind
Pardon me, can't let you see a gangsta cry, Lord have mercy

[Hook: Akelee]
Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on

[Verse 3: Boosie Badazz]
I was lost in a world-wind, now I'm sorry
Five different baby mama's coulda been on Maury
Staying up all night, smoking purp for hours
Can't even get my ass off to church a couple hours
Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I promise I'mma make ya proud
A lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty
Thugs cry, no lie had to hit my knees
Like please please, have mercy on me

[Hook: Akelee]
Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on
Have have mercy, have have mercy
Have mercy on my soul
