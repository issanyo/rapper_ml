[Intro]
I’ll say it, middle fingers in the air, at the mall, what
I’ll say it, middle fingers in the air, at the mall, what
I’ll say it, middle fingers in the air, at the mall, what
I’ll say it, middle fingers in the air, at the mall, what

[Hook: Jeezy]
Beelapee owners I got on, yeah
And it's still motherfuck em all
Why you playing boy you know me
While we at it, boy you owe me
Boy you stay the same all these niggas change
It’s a dirty world and a dirty game
Why you playing boy you know me
And he used to be the homie

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Tell the lord my god baptize in this vodka
But a nigga need to go and get his life right
Drinking all day everyday, clubbing and between
Yeah a nigga still caught up in the nightlife
Cold bad movie, watch the niggas turn snakes
Made a dummy brick man these niggas so fake
I see death around the corner, haters cross the street
Got Versace round my waist, got Versace on my feet
Spent twelve hundred for these shoes nigga, you ain’t even know it
900 for the belt nigga you ain’t even know it
Money is the root of evil, ho niggas be ya downfall
You leave me no choice but to stay the fuck around y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
You used to be my nigga yeah you used to be my mate
We shared the same clothes, we fucked the same bitches
Went to the same high-school, same elementary
Now you mad, is it cause my Rollie presidential
Used to do that white girl that I love lucy
Should have know you was at first cause how you always ate sushi my nigga
Yeah you was my killer
But you know too much about me
So I prolly have to kill you my nigga
You the type to do a nigga like Rico did Mitch
Leave a nigga slumped in a ditch
And I can’t stand a bitch that would fuck a nigga homies
Have a nigga trippin off these brodies off mollies

[Hook]
