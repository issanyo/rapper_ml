Drumma boy (Drumma boy)

I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word

[2 Chainz]
Niggas know I call my Porsche the baby elephant
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment
Everything I got, I got from selling shit
And who I sold it to is irrelevant
Pocket full of Dead Presidents I'm good with whatever
I pull my dick out and tell her sit where ever
I done stood on the block nigga from 9 to 9
And I done sold a 9 at least 9 times
9 Milla, clientele Look Like Thriller
If my baby mama cheating I Hope God with her
You not iller I'm Godzilla on hard liquor
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH

[Hook:]
I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word

[Young Jeezy]
I'm slangin Chickens, I'm slangin Hawks
I take the 4 up out of the brick bitch I can write in chalk
You know I know that white and green like a chalk board
What you doing? Just chillin look like the top board
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup
Must be some owls in this bitch, cause I keep hearing "hoo"
This for my niggas cooking 9s like they chicken breasts
You know we trynna hide the six that's why the chickens dressed
I had the Lam Black and green like a Parakeet
No, I ain't tripping, put the pigeons in the Cherokee
Everything a nigga got, I got from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slanging blocks I got from slanging words
Snow

[Yo Gotti:]
I got a car, that bitch a classic
White on red, inside out that bitch nasty
When I pull up on them sixes, speakers blastin
Black scale white work clear plastic
And everything I got I got from selling birds
Half a brick to do a verse, I guess I am selling words
That dubbed it up
Niggas send me dranks so they double the cup
Got two chains on, bitch I'm icey as fuck
2 brains on my arm that's a 100 and up
We sell dope it ain't nothing to us
New whip, new bitch, nigga change for what?
And where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for some
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playing with us
Work

[Birdman:]
My bad bitch, my money long
Car game filthy and my game strong
The kitchen hot
My block rock
My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot
Nigga on some money shit
Got back on that other shit
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn bitch
Money is for show shit
Gettin it while we blow this bitch
All the time we are gonna show where we are flowing bitch
100 thousand on the watch
Living lavish off top
Neighborhood watch
Cocaine flocks
The coke game strong
Overseas phone
Nigga made it home
So we gettin it on
