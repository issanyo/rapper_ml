[Verse 1]
I want a real bitch and I fuck her girlfriend
Real ride with me, slide with me till the world end
Do the damn thang, we gonn live like stars
Till the feds come through and repo the cards
Till the da kick the door of the crib
Till the atf know exactly where we live
First night we met yeah I knew I had to have her
Right here, right now nigga not a moment after
With the magic in my hands yeah everytime I grab her
Last thang she do to me is fuck another rapper
Life’s too short and my money too long
Together everyday and the bonds getting strong
Yeah it’s like love I don’t know what it is
Last night I had a dream that we had 50 kids
Just me and my bitch no time for the fellows
Just me and my bitch think the homies getting jealous
She whispered in my ear say she wanna fuck with
And in the same breathe told me she is my gangster bitch

[Hook]
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
It’s all a nigga need
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
It’s all a nigga want
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
Even when I’m dead broke fucked up and high
She gonn roll with me, we can ride, we can die

[Verse 2]
Don’t matter if it’s daylight or night time
Long as me are together feel like the right time
Might be going overboard, I think she my lifeline
I don’t think another nigga got a bitch like mine
Must be from heaven cause she feel heaven sent
Say the right think just to give me confidence
Tell me don’t worry baby walk around the corner
Sit back and chill nigga smoke the marijuana
Me and my bitch don’t fuss, we don’t fight
And when we all alone like to grip on real tight
Can’t go to sleep unless my baby spend the night
She on the left side on the bed, I’m on the right
Laid up, late night, smoke and conversating
Chasey got ... all these bitch niggas hating
She told me don’t worry cause it’s hustle get some more
And when the smoke clears, we gonn be standing tall
Just me and my bitch

[Hook]
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
It’s all a nigga need
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
It’s all a nigga want
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
Even when I’m dead broke fucked up and high
She gonn roll with me, we can ride, we can die

[Bridge]
Just me and my bitch
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch, yeah
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
Just me and my bitch
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch, yeah

[Hook]
Me and my gangster bitch, me and my gangster bitch
It’s all a nigga need

She gonn roll with me, we can ride, we can die
