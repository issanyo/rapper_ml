[Intro:]
I can't tell you why
I just changed, from one day to the next
I'm too tired of everything
So, I decided to express my frustrations
You know what the thing about revolutions is?
You don't plan them, I didn't at least
There just happened to be alot of people that agreed with me
I happen to be the voice that spoke
They called me El Jefe

[Hook: x2]
Niggas wanna go, we can go nigga I'm talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now I'm fed up
Hatin' on another grown man get your bread up
We can bread down nigga then keep your head up

See timing is everything
Right now, you and I watch
Streets been watching us since '04
And they still us

[Hook:]
Niggas wanna go, we can go nigga I'm talking head up
Sick and tired of the bullshit and now I'm fed up
Hatin' on another grown man get your bread up
We can bread down nigga then keep your head up

[Verse:]
Niggas tryin' to take the spot yeah you know they gon' try
You ain't gotta say a word know them numbers don't lie
I ain't spazzing, I ain't hating, I ain't trippin' I'm just focused
Came back to claim what's mine I think everybody noticed
Ye I know I got a feeling that nigga's really real was understood
Ain't gotta beef said you niggas know the deal
Got a hole from my partner one time he taught me thirty
Got a nigga wanted 2 way I need another birdy
I'm a kid when he come to get money kinda nerdy
Started kinda 6 fifteen without my 7: 30
If it's up to get some real shit you know I'm going in
Keep your opinions and your comments niggas I can't give a damn
Say, that's the way it is
That's the way it's gonna be
Baby happy till I'm in the same place as Max B
For them niggas do your thing dog you know how cats be
Anything you wanna know about them things just ask me
See I might be from the ghetto but I'm gonna be classy
You can hate it if you want but I'm gonna be flashy
See I do it for the time that I was broken and shit
Bitches say you want them clothes all week, you nasty
See Fox said it best, real niggas don't die
How you niggas so opinionated you don't know the guy
If you think you're going forward then you don't know the guy
If you thinking there's a limit then you don't know the sky
You ain't feeling me guess you ain't fucking with the game
If you ain't feeling me I guess you fucking with them lames
Ye you niggas ho how the fuck you gon' doubt me
Let you niggas see me, how the fuck you gonna out me
