[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Come ride with me, come pray with me
Come ride with me, come roll with me
Roll with me, ride with me

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
All we ever do is rock ice, pour gold
Ever since we was bout 12 years old
Middle of the summer and the streets still cold
Every nigga here got a story untold
(Only N Atlanta)
Gave it to the free men but they wanted love
Diddy said he blew a quarter million in the club
Every nigga here got a box of Arm & Hammer
Every nigga here think he Tony Montana
(Only N Atlanta)

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Welcome to the city where them lil niggas die
Like everybody Gotti, even the broke niggas fly
Every night sun, and it's sunny, we in the club
Got no problem getting this money, just need a plug
Nigga invest more in his chain than in his crib
Nigga invest more in his car than where he live
Swear that bitch in the club at least a 7
Niggas do it all for the fame, be living legends
Shit cost 700, the bottle of what he's sippin'
And if a bitch look like a model she probably strippin
Probably work at Onyx or probably the Blue Flame
An ex street nigga, he called my nickname
For everybody going for self, nobody's changed
Niggas dead-broke still living like millionaires
The welcoming committee, we call them the robbin' crew
There's a very good chance them niggas will rob you

[Hook:]
All we ever do is rock ice, pour gold
Ever since we was bout 12 years old

Gave it to the free men but they wanted love

Every nigga here got a box of Arm & Hammer
Every nigga here think he Tony Montana

[Verse 2: Shad Da God]
Well ye ain’t talkin that belingo
And we playin mad while rippin up the Nino
The big homie guy light up bricks and they gorgeous
You can really get yo ass in jail, go to forge it
Feed the pistol right there on the deal say Feragamo
And niggas out here trappin just to do shit for they mama
We act like some stronger, that’s how we start the flaky summer
And we ain’t got shit but middle finger for your honor
And every niggas wishin we the same, think he baller
And every nigga in the expedition got a 40
And every nigga round me, get your mind on some money shit
We walkin round, we stride like the fuckin government
Every nigga run this bitch, you’re nervous to the bullshit
On that south side, you getting yo fake crap by fuck shit
We hit our measure, tryin to get a plane of shrimp shit
RIP to Double D, king of that pimp shit

[Hook:]
All we ever do is rock ice, pour gold

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I was born in the town where it all goes down
Since the roll had the white hit the bluff with the brown
Man I'm proud to admit, after housing them bricks
Man I'm still a free man blowing loud in the 6
And I'm rich more than a nigga could imagine
From where you get from rappin' or from trappin'
Only in Atlanta can a nigga get it poppin
Off at Magic City, 'hundred thousand in the pocket
Only in Atlanta can a nigga ride D
15 years on 15 key
Only in Atlanta can nigga get paid
Trappin' broad day with a new AK
How we ever do it? Pop bottles for a ho
Roll on 24's with a chrome snub-nose
All we ever get is bank rolls, rubber band round that
Just a message so you can get recognized where you at...

[Hook]
All we ever do is rock ice, pour gold

[Outro:]
You know what I'm sayin?
A-Town nigga! Yea
