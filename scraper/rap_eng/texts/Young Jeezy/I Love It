[Intro]
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I luv it, and I luv it, let's go

[Hook]
We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show
Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I luv it, and I luv it

[Verse 1]
Once again it's on, I'm back in the mu'fuckin' booth
These niggas still lying, I'm the mu'fuckin' truth (yeah!)
I don't believe 'em, I need some mu'fuckin' proof
I ain't want the four door, I copped the mu'fuckin' coupe (haha!)
They tryin' be me, I'm just tryin' be G
And everything comes to da light, you'll see
These niggas in the dark baby I just shine (shine)
I do it from the heart homie, they just rhyme (yeeeeeahhhh!)
Check your watch, nigga it's my time (hey!)
Mind made up I was on my grind, that's right
So pay attention, yea you on my time
In that case time waits for no man
Do it again I done that before man (yeah!)
M.O.E., you ain't part of the program
Or maybe you niggas ain't listening
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I blew up, but they ain't like that
They switched up on me, and I ain't like that
Sold my first brick, yeah, I came right back
Fast forward the tape, nigga look at me now
And I never turn back, so motherfuck that
Nike's on the ground, got my head to the sky
Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high
Stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try
And live for the moment, Lord knows I'm gon' die
And when I get to hell, Lord knows I'm gon' fry
I woke up this morning so I'm still alive
36 O's I sold them all for five

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Been around the world, it's the same ol' caine
Been around the world, it's the same ol' thang, dro
All the real niggas either dead or in jail
And if you're looking for me homie, I'm in the A T L
You gotta play it how it go, you can't cheat on life (yeaaaah!)
Ya better drink a Red Bull, you can't sleep on life
I ain't tryna do you, I'm tryin' do me
Last album did two, I'm just tryin' do three
Fresh out the pot yeah, the work was hard
Ride with the top down so I'm closer to God
My P.O. telling me I need a 9 to 5
But I already got a job, and that's stayin' alive

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it, and I love it
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it, and I love it
