Thug Motivation 103, on the way, nigga

[Verse One]
Guess who's back up in the building, mind on a million
And, with some bitch from Decatur, she be holding my cash
And, I be holding her, she be holding my work, and I be dicking her down
Just got a call from the other side of town, say he trying to come up
The opposite of down, just hope he ain't the Fed, nigga, I'm a new me
Said he's coming right back, he's going to need another free
Two plates, four birds, one nigga, Mister 17-5
Yeah, They know Shawty Lo, anything about dope
Bet your ass, shorty knows, now all the real bitches say 'Go Shawty, go'
I'm a black tee wearing, no, I ain't caring, I'd wreck this bitch
And, come back in a McLaren, know the Fed's stare, I ain't even caring
That's my eighty seven soft, niggas' show them what I'm wearing

[Hook] [x2]
I done, done it all, next shit, Chevy's, Benz, Rari, boats
You ain't ever in your life seen a nigga this focused and I did it all
In a pair of Air Forces
