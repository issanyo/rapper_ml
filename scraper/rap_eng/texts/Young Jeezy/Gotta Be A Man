[Verse 1:]
I'm up early in the morning tryna get it
Come to this paper I ain't never bullshitting
You fucking with a boss baby I be on my swazy
Just know that I'm a street nigga so I'm a little crazy
Fucked a couple bitches in my past that I regret
Same bitches see them out in public I reject
All that carrying on like they really know a nigga
All that carrying on like they really for a nigga
One thing about you if my stock just dropped
Be the same bitch with me in a cardboard box
See all these bitches coming baby loyalty is real
Besides a few mishaps the loyalty is there

[Chorus:]
Coming by the fires baby like the Temptations
I'm only a man that's a lot of temptation
That alcohol and the weed yeah alter my decisions
And every now and then I be losing my religion
Yeah I might rock a few shows, fuck a few hoes
Chase that check, pursue a bankroll
Gotta keep the faith baby it's all God's plan
Until then I hope you understand
A man gon be a man

[Verse 2:]
You could see it in my eyes just now I'm focused
When it come to greatness I'm just tryna get the closest
The haters want me gone being all that I can be
Street nigga with a dream baby what you see in me
When you from where I'm from make it hard for you to trust
Shit I seen niggas do make it hard for me to us
The line around the corner baby just know them bitches waiting
They want to be in your shoes hey that's why them bitches hating
With a ass like that yeah that's gotta be a crime
With a body like that yeah that's gotta be a fine
Every night another city every day another town
Got the club going up so you know it's going down

[Chorus:]
Coming by the fires baby like the Temptations
I'm only a man that's a lot of temptation
That alcohol and the weed yeah alter my decisions
And every now and then I be losing my religion
Yeah I might rock a few shows, fuck a few hoes
Chase that check, pursue a bankroll
Gotta keep the faith baby it's all God's plan
Until then I hope you understand
A man gon be a man

[Bridge:]
You ain't fucking with a weak nigga you fucking with a street nigga (Just know that)
I'm talking grinding all week nigga hardly ever sleep (I'm all for that)
And baby one thing about it baby two things for certain don't nothing come before this paper
And if you ever try that Ima hang up this phone and I won't call your ass later

[Chorus:]
Coming by the fires baby like the Temptations
I'm only a man that's a lot of temptation
That alcohol and the weed yeah alter my decisions
And every now and then I be losing my religion
Yeah I might rock a few shows, fuck a few hoes
Chase that check, pursue a bankroll
Gotta keep the faith baby it's all God's plan
Until then I hope you understand
A man gon be a man
