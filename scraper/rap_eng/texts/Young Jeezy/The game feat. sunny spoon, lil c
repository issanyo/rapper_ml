[Verse 1 - Trae]
They like "Trae, where you been?", niggas actin like I ran away
Hear not, bitch I'm still the king, check the resume
Asshole til they bury me or I get sent away
Ballin off, don't apply to me, I'm thinkin 10 a day
Anyhow, anyway, niggas out here actin gay
Point em out, line em up, bet they ain't gon play with Trae
9/11, flowin panoramic like you been away
(?) there she went today
Tell em that the truth is undisputed and I'm nothin less
Yellow stones, ballin like I'm Kobe when I rep the west
Bitches out here hopin for a trick, my pockets out of use
I keep it G, like my nigga Chris and hit em with a deuce
Fuck em, I got somethin with a bunch of ass skinny waist
Bout to catch a case the way she beat my dick up with her face
Ain't no use in makin plans with me, she know I'm here for sex
On another note, where them haters at, I'm here to plex
How they talkin talkin guns with a pistol and a couple beans
Bitch I'm talkin armageddon shit, they "Yes, you the Marines"
Ain't gon be no chance, you bout to go to sleep
Hit you where you breathe and then you feelin like Miami Heat

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy]
They like young where u been niggas acting like I got goosed
Til I came back in that black on black phantom ghost
Looking better the picasso ya'll should frame me
Killing niggas kunta kinte ya'll should hang me

[Chorus]
Rap game fucked up but you can't blame me
See them come see them go U kno how the game be
Snowman's back, young and too wild
Had to switch it up, man, niggas tryna steal the style

[Verse 3 - Young Jeezy]
Anyway anyhow the stering wheel's black and mild
Make your broad back that ass up think I'm Juvenile
My leather too soft just like Wayne and Baby nem
Teacher ask me what I wanna be told dat bitch an ATM
Dream was to turn my whole block into a CVS
Can't trust them broads around the way them bitches DVS
Drop it in watch it make it circle like a DVD
62 and 125 half a quarter key

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Young Jeezy]
Anyhow anyway it's snitches born everyday
Best thing to do is get your money and stay out the way
Hustla of the year damn right let's be very clear
If u sell them bricks to rocks and stones now it's Belvedere
Posted on the block with the choppers, guess it's vodka now
Hard slowed up niggas switched playing soccer now
Do it for the killas and the dealers know you heard of me
Young came back to save the day see the urgency

[Chorus]
