I'm in a new SS and the tag still on it
And the pussy niggas hating cause all the hoes on it
She ask me why I looked so mean
I said the Benz just boosted up my self-esteem
Nigga I'm the shit and if I ain't y'all let me think what think
Matter of fact tell the waitress let me drink what I drink
Nigga think I ain't
No need to brag
Man these hoes love Jeezy they just like my swag
The way I do my thang
I'm just a young ghetto nigga wit a big ass chain

If you feeling like a pimp dog gon' brush ya shoulders off
I'm trapping lil daddy gon' get them boulders off
And I'mma teach you how to stunt
As soon as my niggas roll up these blunts
She said she like my domineer
Between you and me I think she's digging my Beemer
Love the way a lil nigga spit so slick
Plus she heard I gotta big dick that's it
Yeah put it on me girl
Matter of fact tell ya friends put it on me girl
Gangsta shit we got dro in the air
Bottles of Crist', Grey Goose everywhere

I gotta stable full of hoes and a trap full of dealers
A house full of bloods and a house full of killers
I'm heavy on the streets with a rep long as old Nash
I hit a hater wit a heat from a cold gat
I'm posted up on a corner like a street light
Making sure the money move making sure I eat right
Dollar for dollar and dime for dime
We out here hustle for hustle, nigga grind for grind
We got them nines in a halfs
Even them old things grinding on them hash
Folding for doe mane
We all in the dope game
Buying and selling
You haters buying and telling
But what is my niggas yelling

[Hook]
