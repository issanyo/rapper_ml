Say, drama this on my momma, I served em like Benihana's
Took them numbers down, they ate em up like them piranhas
Swear I had the whole hood bitin like them iguanas
Had them chicken tenders all lined up, like the McDonalds
Up early thuggin, cookin this breakfast in my pajamas
Dropped a thousand but I lost 28, at least I'm honest
Man these niggas lyin all on tracks, all on wax
We don't wanna hear ya imagination just state facts
Nigga either ya didn't or you did, just don't lie
Look, nigga either you was or you wasn't just don't lie
Use to cop them bitches 3 at a time call that a trio
And if they short, then fuck you too just like I'm cee-lo
What you know about so many bricks, fill up a neo?
Shit I meant neon, run em back like I'm deion
Treat em just like Pacquiao, they gotta weigh in
Can't even come outside, they gotta stay in
Kink put me off in the game, I gotta play then
Tryna get the play dough, but nah, don't play though
Got a case, he callin ya phone, what's the connection?
Hang up, Fuck figurin it out, bad reception
And you ain't gotta be a detective just to detect em
Any nigga lie to ya face, how you respect em?
In the kitchen cussin the pot like my baby mama
That 4 ain't lockin up right, that's baby drama
Make me start deporting you niggas just like I'm castro
Any nigga play both sides, he donnie brasco
And I ain't seen when I was making them movies like tarantino
Last time tellin you, shit bigger than nino
Bigger than nino? Ask G-Money, spent it all fuckin night
Like the shit was free money, like my My-Face on it
Like the shit was me money, if the dogs hit the bag
Then you know it's D-Money. You know I run this shit
Like marlo, these niggas avon, had my auntie sellin that shit
Like it was avon, yall know what's real or what's fake, that's on shake
What you call it when you whippin that thang? Vanilla Shake
What you call it when you whippin that thang? Vanilla Smoothie
Call that shit that wouldn't jump back, Vanilla ooo-wee
Snow is you worried bout niggas? I'm like, Fuck No
Straight up outta low cash, these niggas gusto
And I don't give a fuck if it's been bout 10 years
I can come back with 10 years and 5 jeers
All I need is trap life cross my belly, I'm makaveli
Coupe got the pasta seats, look like spaghetti
Yall ain't ready, clips long as machetes
I said, yall ain't ready, clips long as machetes
Use to drive a 500 to school, could fuck the teacher
First thing she said in the morning "Turn off ya beeper"
I said, excuse me miss, I'm tryna be P and Jay-Z
If you think I'm missin out on this money you cray-z
And all these niggas talkin these diamonds, appraise me
See I'm the one who made it straight out the streets, they praise me
All I know is one way to trap, and that's hard
If so I trapped hard then that make me a trap god
Bow down and kiss the chucks I'm bruce leroy
Sell 10 mill tomorrow I'm still a D-Boy
The real is back
