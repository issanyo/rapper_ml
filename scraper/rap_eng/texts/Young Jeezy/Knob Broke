[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Homie just keep it real, I know what you was thinking
Between all the hater raising and all that liquor you drinking
You was probably thinking that I go out like a sucker
That’s what you get for thinking you ignorant motherfucker
It’s Jeezy G from the gutter, these rappers fraudently busters
Post up, served the cluckers and used to dare em to cuff us
Got the work from the Mexicans used to dare em to trust us
‘Cause we taking that shit like it got caught up in customs
Bad bitches they lusting’ real niggas discussin
See them taking them shots, they bounce off of them it’s nothing
Don’t let this rap shit fool you , run up on him, he busting’
Don’t let these rap niggas fool you , that’s the end of discussion
See I would die by this shit, and whatever that’s worth
You niggas step in my yard I go to war bout my turf
See , Young one of the realest niggas that's walking this earth
Nigga you heard what I said and that’s the end of my verse

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Nigga if you’re about to issue, then you know how I feel
Look dead in your eyes and let you know that it’s real
I see these niggas is faking so I’ma be realistic
See these niggas is playing so let me kick the ballistics
Throw that brick in the oven, bake that bitch like a biscuit
Way I weigh up this yolo, you'd think I majored in physics
And I’ma stay sucker free, that’s right I’m gon keep my distance
Can’t fuck round with these suckers, I learned that there through experience
If the subject is trapping then I’ma head of the class
Heard you niggas is broke, and you might need a cash
Yes, some niggas get money, but that shit don’t make ‘em real
If you lie good enough, you just might get you a deal
I’m a real one for real, real shit pay my bills
If I wasn't rappin, baby I’d be still counting mills
If I wasn't rappin, baby I’d be still toting steel
See I made this shit yea, so I can turn up for real

[Hook: Jeezy]

See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Sometimes it feels so awkward
She watch me take a shower
I asked her why she didn't join me
She said because you didn't ask me
I said damn, I didn't think I had to
Then she take off my towel, I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me
Just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it
See we ain't got much in common
So we don't do that much talking
Cause every time she try to tell me something
She open up her mouth and I stick my tongue in
She got a piercing in her vagina
A skirt with nothing under
And she say when she don't see me, she feel like Stevie Wonder
That's when I said
Work, work, work
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt
And she made me cum 100 times
She made me cum 100 times
She got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now
I'm calling you first
And then made her cum a 100 times
She kinda green but I'm color blind

[Hook 2: Lil Wayne]
See we ain't got much in common
