Keep my name out your mu'fuckin' mouth (out yo' mouth) {*3X*}
Cause I was raised in the motherfuckin' south (in the south)
Keep my name out your mu'fuckin' mouth (out yo' mouth) {*3X*}
Cause I was raised in the motherfuckin'...

[Ludacris]
(Luda!) Southside, College Park, yeah I rep that
Where there's money, all my dawgs, go and fetch that
Niggas robbin' in the hood, we don't sweat that
Throw some some red dots up on your head and connect that (HAHH!)
I guess you in the right place, at the right time
And I been drinkin' I'm not really in my right mind
The wrong move'll make a nigga grab the right nine
Knock your livin' daylights out, bitch, night time
Come off up them stacks, if you don't give 'em then we gon' take 'em
Go and get 'em or we gon' chase him, go stick him and might erase him
Or turn him into a patient, any demon's we gon' face 'em
Or see all the pigs and all that bacon, we gon' as-salamu alaykum

These pussy niggas only talkin' cause they got lips
Guess them choppers only bustin' cause them bitches got clips (YEEEAH~!)
Got them niggas bustin' off the motorcycle like Chips (haha)
Think I seen them round Bloods, so they mighta been Crips
All this rappin' ain't no action, see I can't respect that (nah)
Bout to ask him for that trap, and nigga I'mma check that (DAAAMN)
Hundred units in the living room, and you can bet that
I'm so high up in this bitch look like I got a jet pack (WHOO)
If you a real street nigga, won't you tell me how it feel
So bought some 26s before you played her like Bill
So keep your name up out your mouth, gives a fuck bout how you feel
Cause in these motherfuckin' streets, +I Am Legend+ like Will

[Ludacris]
These niggas is sweeter than a sweet potato, softer than Play-Doh, hope bitch nigga, lay low
A-Town by the way of Illinois and our blocks come together like Legos, they know
Who I am, I'm the man with a plane and a nigga with verses, blowin' a rapper to pieces
Got a crew full of untamed dogs, and I'm thinkin' that I'm really bout to let 'em off the leashes (WOOF)
I'm scratchin the surface, the nigga with the million dollar verses (WHOO)
These rappers are worthless and all I really wanna do is piss 'em off on purpose
I'm possessed, stick a needle in your back like a nigga doing voodoo curses
Givin' them a two piece with a biscuit and hell no I ain't talkin 'bout churches (OHHH)
Get nervous, get robbed of your valuables nigga like I'm snatching your purses
And I got a couple urges to clown on you niggas like a three ring circus
If you ain't got no warrants, then you best to believe it'll be no searches
So keep my name up out your mouth before I close your curtains
