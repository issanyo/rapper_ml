One of the realest niggas to ever bless a beat (told these niggas mane)

Aim for the sky, thats all I can tell ya (yup)
Roll the purple up and get high like Delta (aye)
Now I'm in my own world, way up in the clouds (clouds)
Gangsta's paradise, no haters allowed

[Slick Pulla talking]
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on Drama
I don't think these niggas heard my big homie nigga
Play that shit back in the re-bump nigga
This CTE USDA the voice box of the block

Aim for the sky, thats all I can tell ya (yup)
Roll the purple up and get high like Delta (aye)
I'm in my own world, way up in the clouds (clouds)
Gangsta's paradise, no haters allowed
It all happened so fast, take time think
Pinch myself, take time to blink (aye)
So what do ya do wen the whole world loves ya? (loves ya)
The hustlers and the gangstas put nuttin above ya? (chea)
Love is love, ya just can't fake it (uh uh)
These niggas really happy to see one of us make it
Don't talk much, do a whole lotta thinkin'
My nerves still bad, do a whole lotta drinkin' (deeam)
Hot summer nights wake up in a cold sweat (sweat)
Gave my partner ten he ain't came home yet (nope)
Still I ride big boy coupes through traffic
Can get 20 years for what I got in this plastic (ha ha)
And it don't stop there, look at my passenger seat (aye)
Can getta another 10 for just packin the heat (deeam)
Cuz nowadays, man, these niggas'll kill ya
Think ya hard like concrete? These niggas'll drill ya
It ain't a criiiiime until ya get caught
Just thought I'd take a minute to bless ya with my thoughts (ya know)
Money is a terrible thing to waste
Thats why ya stack it to the ceilin' hide it all in ya safe (whoo)
I'm so complex, I got a beautiful mind
I'm such a hustler, I got a beautiful grind (I know)
And I can take ya niggas back to the gentlemen's club
You can catch me upstairs I'm such a gentlemen's thug
Get off my dick thats what you need to do (need to do)
O.G. and Shuga can't vouch for you (ha ha)
In '98 I had the GS4 (wha?)
Gettin' my Busta Rhymes on, nigga gimme sum mo'

You niggas just rap about it, I was livin it
Take ya back when Timbo and Dave and them was gettin it
Cook it on the stove, not the microwave
Back when niggas rolled around and had finger waves
Can't forget them Edward J mixtapes
When niggas went to Mechanicsville just to get straight
See these rap niggas wouldn't know nuttin' 'bout that (nah)
Like a V.H.S., just rewind it back (deeam)

I risk my life just to talk like this (yup)
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
I swear I ride through the city in a two-seater (yuh!)
Fo-Five on my hip, black wife beater

All I need is one mic, or a half a brick
Gimme a, half an hour I be on some shit (yeeeahhh)
Trap stay boomin', yeah, we breeze through the packs (packs)
This rap shit easy, I just breeze through the tracks

When you hot, ya hot, when ya not, ya not (not, ya not)
Prolly why them white boys keep rushin' the spot (yuh)
An errbody tellin me how nice I am
But I'm a real street nigga so ain't givin' a damn (uh uh)

A day in the life, just another episode
I'm in the streets like them lines in the middle of the road (aye)
New Lambo got the feds all curious (curious)
So you can stop watchin' me, I take this rap shit serious (yuh)

So why not stay in the studio for hours?
When you can make same pay as you do wit powder (yuh)
Chi-town's lovin me, L.A.'s feelin' me
This clown keep talkin lil' nigga ya killin' me (ha ha)
Or better yet, ya killin yaself (yup)
Fuckin' wit the big boys could be bad for ya health
I take shit personal I'm so sincere
Lil' nigga talk at me so I'll end his career (ha ha)

Catch me cruisin through the city in sum'n bout a buck-fitty (neeermm)
Top down, iced out, won't na'an nigga fuck wit me
And I was shinin' like this before my album dropped
That was right around the time that yo album flopped
