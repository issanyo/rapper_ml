[Chorus]
My Partner just got gunned down in his hood last week (out here in these streetz)
My nigga 24hours out the feds, say he gotta eat (so we back off in these streets)
Real niggas gettin money
Why you givin' all yours to the freaks (when you out here in the streetz)
It's a jungle out here
Everyday we on point, neva weak (we out here in the streetz)

[Verse 1]
Ima hustle cuz I gotta, splurge when I can
This the conscience of a God fearin' man
They say you live by the Glock 40, you die by the 45
Missin' the day Lil Mike and Big K was still alive
Dem bitches missin' yo swag and ya momma missin' ya smile nigga
When I got the call I almost threw in the towel nigga
Lately been stressin', shit been giving me migraines
Got some foul niggas round me, that keep on playing all these mind games
Seen a black president, I ain't see no change tho
They say street life numb ya, all I feel is pain tho
I can tell ya some stories that make a grown ass man cry
Aye dis wat it what it sound like when a grown ass man try
Heey

[Chorus]
My Partner just got gunned down in his hood last week (out here in these streetz)
My nigga 24hours out the feds, say he gotta eat (so we back off in these streets)
Real niggas gettin money
Why you givin' all yours to the freaks (when you out here in the streetz)
It's a jungle out here
Everyday we on point, neva weak (we out here in the streetz)

[Verse 2]
I been smokin' so much lately, really think my brain fried
Thinkin' so much lately really think my brain tired
See, I'm from a small town called we don't give a fuck
Population bout four thou, so I'm never givin' up
Like Jizzle had big dreams, like Jizzle had big goals
Saw him the otha day, nigga looked like a lost soul/
Streets taught me stand tall, chest out neva fold
That real stand up, guy shit, never gets old
All he need was a quarter, now he start with a good seven
Flipped it a zillion times that made him a livin' legend
I can tell ya some shit that make a grown ass man cry
Aye dis wat it sound like when a grown ass man try
Heey

[Chorus]
My Partner just got gunned down in his hood last week (out here in these streetz)
My nigga 24hours out the feds, say he gotta eat (so we back off in these streets)
Real niggas gettin money
Why you givin' all yours to the freaks (when you out here in the streetz)
It's a jungle out here
Everyday we on point, neva weak (we out here in the streetz)

[Outro]
Gotta watch for the task force finessers and robbin crew
Nightmares for anybody dreaming of robbing you (in these streets)
Court cases nigga lawyer fees
Escaping the luxury got the federal custody in these streets
All the good jobs firin, ups ainâ€™t hiring
Man this stress getting tiring in these streets
Own potna out to get cha an if u cross that line own potna get his issue
Heey
