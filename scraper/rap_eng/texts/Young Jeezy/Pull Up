[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Know I've been drinking, smell like Marijuana
People pulling me over, I'mma be a goner
Every time we hook up, Smell like California
She said "Baby make it happen"
I'm bout to pull up on her
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I said I pull up on her
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I say I pull up on her
With them copper tops and a Calico
Lil 2-2-3 and lil' snub nose
That 40 cal and that desert owl and that 38s'll set ya straight
My weed strong and my money long
And my bad bitch in my safe home
Ain't no telling what I been drinking on
Keep fucking riding, I won't make it home

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I pull up like monkey bars, OG and sweet cigars
Might just bust their brain when I pull that wet thing out my garage
Bought that shit for the broads, souped up and supercharged
Your main bitch a super freak, won't you send that on my regards
My dank stanking everywhere I go, feds want a nigga head I know
Nike box wa my piggy bank, I make a bitch faint with all the bread I blow
Bend it over girl, head to toe, pulled it out and she's trained to go
Bitch tripping, get 86'd if she don't suck a dick in my '84
My eyes red and my mask black and that loud pack, I just passed that
And you dumb niggas get jacked then ainâ€™t got the nuts to come blast back
And I'm thugged out, stay tooled up big dolo straight jeweled up
You rap niggas might talk tough, but they pulled off when we pulled up

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

She said "Baby make it happen"

I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I pull up, I pull up

I pull up, I pull up, I pull up
I pull up, I say I pull up on her

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I got 22s on that coupe, roof back on that 'rari
Them hoes choose when I come through, if they were with you well I'm sorry
We pulling up, hopping out, we pull 'em in, just point 'em out
We going hard, they going in, we showing up and they showing out
We throwing out that loose change, got bank rolls at blue flame
Got 50 thousand in cheddar knots, it's like I'm still slanging that cocaine
On fire like propane, kick it hard like Rogaine
With a bitch who'll get a bitch, go ask a bitch "What's your name?"
My nigga Jeezy know the little freaky hoes
I got the ones who with it but it's a secret though
In the presidential suite - all broads, we trade 'em like baseball cards
Probably y'all broads, we ball hard, we pullin' up and it going down
Been drinking all day, drunk as fuck, I got blunts of bubba kush going round
