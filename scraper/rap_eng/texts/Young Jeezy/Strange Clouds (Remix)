[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I've been drinking so much my bitch said that "You're a alcoholic"
Every time I find something I'm good at you gotta spoil it
She said "Boy you need some help, damn right, you got it bad"
I say "Bitch we'll see next time that I buy your ass a bag"
Yeah Jizzle talk them birds, last time he seen a brick
What the fuck he rapping 'bout, last time he had a hit
In the back I got it loud like "Who the fuck you talking to?"
All that yelling, all that screaming, what the fuck you 'bout to do?
I don't do the lean but what's up with them double cups?
I say put vodka in both them muhfuckers, double up
I'm so high up in the clouds I hope I make it home
I'm so fucked up in the booth right now I hope I make the song

[Hook: B.o.B]
All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

All we do is pour it up all night, drinks out
(That's all we do, that's all we do)
And all we do is light it up, all night
All you see is strange clouds
(Strange clouds, strange clouds)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Uh, on the private jet, left to right I be coast to coastin'
Ay, I don't get throwed, I just twist up and get roller coastered
Ay, I'm gone, grandaddy purp cologne, nigga stop
So high I live in the sky, Leroy Jetson dro nigga
Okay, if I ball they dodgeballin', elementary
I be smoking that OBomb, that Oval Office, presidents
She pop, her knees drop, cuz these bottles are complementary
All night we making history, paparazzi be documenting my clique
You sideline, I'm headline at the top left
Take home the gold then hit the bowl, I'm Mike Phelps
Rings out with the prize belt, Olympic ganja, damn right
I'm 12:30, I'm groovy baby, all day, all night

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Every time you see him shorty going in
Go to jail, get back, here we go again
Back of that black Benz, get into that dough again
Million, Grand Hustle real nigga, no pretend
Bank roll can't fold, dough to the ceiling
A legend where he lived in, Bankhead brilliant
Ghetto bougie with bitches with ghetto booty, let's go cutie
Swagger so art deco I Ecko, Prada, Margiela, Louis
Blowing sticky-icky, get her gooey-ooey
He say she won't licky-licky, he don't know me, do he
Ay truly Tip is just the coolest, thought you knew this
Guess the proof is in how long a nigga do it
BOW
