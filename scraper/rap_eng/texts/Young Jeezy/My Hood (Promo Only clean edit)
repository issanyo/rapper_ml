(Chorus)(Repeat 2x)
Every time I do it I do it for my hood
And every time I do it I do it for yo hood
And every time I do it I do it for they hood
It's understood I do it for the hood

The streets love jeezy and I love 'em back
If I still had the work I getcha sack
It's all gravy still reaching wit my words
And make 'em feel good on the first and the third
Take you back when I was sixteen wit a bankroll
Posted on a corner like a light pole
They used to call us trap stars
Before they even stopped we ran to dem cars
And everybody on the block got the same agenda
Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga straight drinkin brown (7/11 nigga you know)
You know 10 to 4 shake 'em up talk shit get my drink and let 'em go
Even when I'm on the road the gangstas stay in touch
Why the fuck you think they love me so much? (ha ha!)

(Chorus)
I'm talking bout summertime cookouts and wintertime flights
It ain't nothing we hearing shots all night (bow)
Ford Taurus pulls up everybody run
White boys jump out pointing wit they guns
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back (hey)
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack
Real recognize real I suppose
I guess that's why the gangstas be at all my shows
Got the deal nothing changed but my clothes
Still catch me in the jects fuckin wit dem hoes (projects!)
Like coo-coo cal
Lord I wish mad Lou could see me now
Wish gold mouth was there wish mailman was free
A lot of niggas crossing over dog no not me
Plus I been in the commercials when I watch TV
And everybody know I rep these streets faithfully (hey)

(Chorus)
Ford Taurus pull up everybody run
White boys jump out pointing wit they guns
Ford Taurus leave everybody came back (hey)
Hope dem boyz didn't find my sack

(Chorus)
