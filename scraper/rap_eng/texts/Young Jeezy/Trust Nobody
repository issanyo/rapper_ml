[Intro]
Cause the average black male is
Is, is dead by the age of eighteen
And, 'bout 14 they carrying guns, automatic weapons
Or at 21 they in jail over half of their life
The rest of their lives
You know it's like they kill each other one by one
You everyday just fight, just kill each other
I, I don't know what's going on

[Hook] (x2)
And I don't trust no motherfucking body
I'm paranoid, two K's in my Maserati
Puttin' liquor to the head
Weed got me feeling like I'm stumped
Stressed out and iced up

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't even look me in my eyes
Speak behind my back, said his partner wasn't mine
Money is the motive, and jealousy's the reason
But I'm 'bout to set it straight this evening
And nigga motherfuck the fame, you can have that
Real niggas keep it real, this shit is past that
Take a kid grown man, that ain't the game plan
We were selling dope then, I'm a changed man
The only thing I tried to teach ya, be ya own man
And nigga get up your ass, you a grown man
Still trippin' 'bout that time dawg?
Mentally incarcerated, still doing mine dawg
And it was what it was, those kids nigga
And when he did the same for you, that's on my kid nigga
And now you let this bullshit tear us apart nigga
How could you do me like that, you was my heart nigga

[Hook] (x2)
And I don't trust no motherfucking body
I'm paranoid, two K's in my Maserati
Puttin' liquor to the head
Weed got me feeling like I'm stumped
Stressed out and iced up

[Verse 2]
Niggas in my dream tryna kill me in my sleep
Huddled, came in all black, and unleashed 40 deep
But I couldn't make it out, kept screaming three letters
Couldn't hear em for the guns, they were lot of screeches
Breaking up on my sleep, cause my past come to hold me
Call up, cause real niggas get lonely
She said she love me, she probably on the tape
But the pussy so good, make you wanna get raped
I can assist lil young nigga, keep pace
And maybe y'all can help me, cause I got a situation
She know me from the streets, so we know the same niggas
But coming from where I'm from
Man these bitches frame niggas
You know they run they game, but this ain't a game nigga
Man these bitches get you killed, man especially lame niggas
She filled up my heart but don't fill up my soul
When I looked her to the eye, all I know this bitch cold

[Hook] (x2)
And I don't trust no motherfucking body
I'm paranoid, two K's in my Maserati
Puttin' liquor to the head
Weed got me feeling like I'm stumped
Stressed out and iced up

[Verse 3]
I fall to my knees, lord knows I'm misshaped
Why everybody close to you gotta take
Can't give him this mess, cause I need his advice
But I ride on these motherfuckers, don't think twice
Me and my pops ain't cool as we should be
Maybe cause he left me out dead, that's what it coulda been
No choice but to grow up tryna be a man
So he lost his only son, hope he understand
No time to be in charge, tryna stay alive
Breath stickin, phone ringing, closing my eyes
When the only thing I had in this world was my rocks
That was tucked deep way down in my socks
You want to pass, but he already failed me
Moms out the sewer, what the fuck he gone tell me
If I ever leave, give her what's in the safe
And open casket, even if they hit me in my face

[Hook] (x2)
And I don't trust no motherfucking body
I'm paranoid, two K's in my Maserati
Pourin' liquor to the head
Weed got me feeling like I'm stumped
Stressed out and iced up
