[Intro: Young Thug & Chris Brown]
Wrist, tip, four, tip, four, tip
Wrist, tip, four, tip, wrist
It's Breezy, Tom Thugger
Wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, tip, four, tip, four
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Cause my wrist still dripping, 44's still tip
In the cut with my hittas, no they do not miss
I'm a champagne pouring nigga, I love big asses and tits (show me them titties)
And if you're here just to witness, I just promise this

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Skrr, pull up in a Barbie
That's a brand new 16, 10-4
Excuse me, darling
Yeah, are you a nympho?
Baby are you for the police?
I ain't never ever got no info
Hoe, I'm sorry
In a nigga bitch mouth like Trident
I'mma, raise all the K's
AK's and SK's and Techs on my side
Better watch what you say
Cause I'm with that bullshit, I'm so ready to die
Right babe, what do you need?
I'm on the phone with my supplier
Bitch I'm armed like a sleeve
Don't get stuck with a knife

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Young Thug]
Bitch go ahead look at my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
She told me murk it baby, no problem
I'mma kill that pussy like OJ
Then I'mma turn her over, hit her from the back
Talk to her like my name Rappin' 4-Tay
Slang that dope, get codeine
Make your whole body numb
You can call me the marathon man
Bitch I make your whole body run
My wrist dripping, your bitch tripping
Yeah she on my pole, she moving like a stripper
Rolled a swisha sweet, got her in my bed
She was on my dick and I was on the liquor
Wrist 100K, clips is 50 rounds
Bitch you know my seats is peanut butter brown
God damn, must be the bread
Got me fucking up her lace fronts, gimme that head

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Bitch go ahead look at my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip
Wrist, drip, 44's tip
