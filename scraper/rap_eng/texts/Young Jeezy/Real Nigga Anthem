[Verse 1]
Look nigga I told y'all
Young don’t bend,don’t break,don’t budge, or fold dawg
And I done-done mo' with less
One stove,one fork, nine O's nigga tons of stress
When I'm against all odds is when at my best
It was me against the world, I stuck out my chest
Shit is real man a nigga got migraines
But I doubt tylenol will help me in my pain
I need some champagne and a bad bitch
So I can tell her about the times that I ain't had shit
Slow down baby I'm on a bottle
Paid blood, sweat and tears for the Murciélago
And lord have mercy, I need to keep my soul clean
But don’t stop this party by any means
You tell them motherfuckers bring it on (Bring it on)
Now all my real niggas sing ya song (Yeah)

[Hook]
Some niggas said I won’t make it (make it)
And other niggas can’t take it (take it)
Shits real can't fake it (Yeah)
You know they say life is only what you make it (Ha ha)
Cuz real nigga is getting money (Getting Money)
Real nigga is getting money (Getting Money)
Real nigga is getting money (Getting Money)

[Verse 2]
Why you think this industry hate me
Niggas can say what they say I ain't lettin em  play me
These Industry Niggas play ho games see me
I'm a street nigga dawg we play no games
I know you never heard it before maine
This rap shit damn near worse than the dope game
So far gone only god can save me
All the shit I been through maybe God  is crazy
When all your homies dead or incarcerated
You gotta take your time to thank god you made it
Made it out  the streets nigga must be smart
Say the nigga so cool he wear his shades in the dark
Got on my grind like there was nothing to loose
Then I stay down nigga till there was nothing to move
You tell them motherfuckers bring it on (Bring it on)
Now all my real niggas sing ya song (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
YallI know I got that dog in me
Yeahit ain't secret no they got that hog in me
Yeah that’s right for both greedy and viscous
Ever had a taste of success its delicious
Eat whole plate no time to do the dishes
Too much at stake no time for the bitches
Cuz when you cased up They put on they make up
And go and fuck the same nigga that got you cased up
Fuck hoes, life's a bitch nigga
Who you gone replace me with, these niggas(ha ha)
Y'all crazy  never seems to amaze me
These niggas ain't even themselves and I’m crazy(Yeah)
That’s right yall crazy If these niggas 30 a brick then I’m 80
You tell them motherfuckers bring it on (Bring it on)
Now all my  real niggas sing ya song (Yeah)
