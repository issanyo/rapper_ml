(Dolla $ign)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I got a bad bitch and she feisty
Red bottoms on, no Nike's
I'm a Aries, she a Pisces
We fuck, clean it up with a white T
And she don't wanna be no wifey
I'm a dub, she a dime piece
She never wear the same clothes twice
I hit it raw, yeah, I roll the dice
Eat it 'fore I beat it, I'm a coochie eater
Fucked her in my chucks and my white beater
Taste like water, smell like Chanel
Pussy wetter than a wishing well
She keep saying she gone leave me
But she don't cause she need me

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Fuck her from the back cause love is blind
Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign
Fuck her from the back cause love is blind
Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Look back at it, all you see is Dolla $ign

[Verse 2:]
She told me fuck her like a gangster
Choke her out, pull her and spank her
Dick won't fit, use my fingers
She only want me cause I'm famous
I met her at the supper club
We fucked on the first night
Big booty, brown skin
Say my name when I'm pounding
Pounding, pounding
Bust once, she told me put another round in
She said my dick bigger than a mountain
Let her ride just to stretch it out
But first I put it in her mouth
Then I hit it from the back cause love is blind

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Now I'm all my ladies drop, drop real low
And pick it up pick it up, pick it up, slow down
All my ladies it drop, real low
And pick it up pick it, up pick it up, slow down

[Verse 3: YG]
I can be yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I fuck you like yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I can be yo nigga, fuck you in the backseat of that Porsche
Ass up, face down, of course speed it up like bam bam everytime I'm come through
And I use my tongue too
I can be yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I fuck you like yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I can be yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I fuck you like yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
Don't tell me what yo home girl said that she saw a nigga do
Unless you saw a nigga too
Don't tell me what yo home girl said that she saw a nigga do
Unless you saw a nigga too
Girl, I can be yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
I fuck you like yo nigga, but I can't be yo man
Don't tell me what yo home girl said that she saw a nigga do
Unless you saw a nigga too
I do it for them dolla signs
From the back, love is blind
All she see is Dolla $igns
Baby girl, love is blind

(My Cabana (Remix))

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Light the swishers', bring the bottles, been on my grind, stacking mills
I need all my real bitches to put your hands in the ceiling
This the remix, bad bitches gotta feel us
You already ready know a real nigga in the building
D-boy, used to sell coke
Black Rolls Royce, I swear it float
Got some Howard bitches and they all fine
When I’m in DC they all mine
My Cali bitches, they just wanna smoke
Them Dayton County bitches got that deep throat
My Brooklyn bitch she just wanna ball
Have her orgasm when she see the mall
Drunk bitches like me in all black
She grab my chains while I hit it from the back
My Houston bitch like to pop mollies
And take her clothes off like she workin’ for it
This my cabana, yeah…

[Hook]
My cabana, my cabana, my cabana
How many girls can I fit in
My cabana, my cabana, my cabana
How many hoes, hoes

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
White girls love to do coke
Black girls always want to smoke
Asian hoes like to drink sake
My Spanish bitch want to pop a molly
My top ten bitches wear Chanel
I hate bitches wearing fake nails
Dumb bitches think I can't tell
She got butt pads on that's a fail (that's a fail)
Them Greystone girls all 10's
Them ugly hoes can't get in
Hundred bottles every weekend
The bitch on drugs peakin'

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
Nah nah, nah nah
La da da di da di da daaah
Nah nah, nah nah
La da da di da di da daaaaaah
Oh Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Dolla
