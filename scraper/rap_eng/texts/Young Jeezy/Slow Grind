Slow grind
Slow grind
What you niggas know about that slow grind?
Somtimes it dont come fast, it take time
What you niggas know about that slow grind?

[Verse 1]
I ain't bullshitting at all, need a Tylenol
So I can lay it down and go to sleep till its time to ball
I can do this shit im my sleep I ain't trying at all
Bitch you know I been here before I ain't lying at all
Had to get back up on my feet, had to grind it up
Took them plastic bags out that box, I was tying em up
When I get that iced out watch, they'll be dying to fuck
Bitch I'm talking so many coupes, I'll be dying to truck
So many colors on the Chevy its Candyland
Everytime I ride through the hood there go candyman
Three point fives and them sevens im hand to hand
Bitch I hit that brick with the hammer I'm da handyman

[Verse 2]
Somebody roll another blunt I ain't ready to go
Bitch I'm just chillin doing me so just let me snow
Got that Glock 9 on standby and its read' to go
Hustler got no time for a cut I'm just lettin' it grow
And I dont know where dis coming from I'm just lettin' it flow
Damn right this is what I duz, I'm just lettin' you know
Say empty pockets? Just to get, I got bills to pay
So I had to add traffickin to my resume
Yeah I rolled straight passed the task with a half today
Then I took some time countin cash da other half today
That's why I had the 'Rari for the deal just ask Jazzy Pha
Cause I beat that bitch with that force just like Annie Mae
