[Hook]

I tell it like it is
Not how it might be
Straight from the heart
That's why they don't like me
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)

Me crossing over
Naw they ain't like me
Never bite my tongue
That's why they don't like me

The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)

[Verse 1: Young Jeeezy]

The mixtape king
Y'all know I ain't lying
Had the whole muthafucking world trapping or dying
DAMN
Then I made the dope boys go crazy
Guess they ain't understand me cause then they tried ban me
Yea I sold soft but I can't change that
Whats done is done
Look I can't explain that
Real street nigga
Don't knock it till ya try it
Time to re-up
Can't sell it till ya buy it
Nothing against B.E.T but somebody hating
Y'all can explain to the streets why I ain't get nominated
I'm in the NYC getting my Summer Jam on
But I ain't nominees so I'm guessing they was on

I tell it like it is
Not how it might be
Straight from the heart
That's why they don't like me
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)

Me crossing over
Naw they ain't like me
Never bite my tongue
That's why they don't like me

The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]

They ain't want a nigga in so they locked they door
Ain't take NO for an answer so I knock some mo
Then I kicked that bitch down knocked it off the hinges
You see me on stage catalog is endless
Ain't much to think about the punch lines is simple
But it straight from the heart, got damn he hard
The real niggas love me
The haters can't stand me
I can pack any club on the muthafucking planet
The last dragon the eye of the tiger
I got this rap shit in a cobra clutch
Its C.T.E ain't nothing fucking with us
Bout to bring the streets back
Now how real is that


[Hook]

I tell it like it is
Not how it might be
Straight from the heart
That's why they don't like me
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey

Me crossing over
Naw they ain't like me
Never bite my tongue
That's why they don't like me

The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey



[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]

The truth in the flesh, the man not the myth
Its not a sight that he speaks like a prohet
Speaking of profit, how much we making?
Uncle sam won't hear us, how much he taking?
Either way, the words to the birds
I ain't tripping little daddy I'm just trying to be heard
You wouldn't understand so just leave it alone
Somebody tell me the definition of wrong (Yeaaaaa)
Back against the wall I was forced to grind
Money came so fast I was force to shine
Then I stepped in the booth and gave them the trap
And just like the song the rest was a rap



[Hook]

I tell it like it is
Not how it might be
Straight from the heart
That's why they don't like me
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey
The underdawg hey

Me crossing over
Naw they ain't like me
Never bite my tongue
That's why they don't like me

The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
The underdawg (hey)
