[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & (Jeezy)]
The Rumor has it
That you're back in town
Seen your face
I Heard your name for awhile
(Dope man, dope man)
Everything still the same
People want it, just got to have it! yeah

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Got the world at my finger tips
I swear I'll never slip
Gorilla chops and it came with banana clips
Two tone 62 hard with a silver back
62 in the pot tryin' to bring a 100 back
The boy talk blow like its stuck in the 80's
Automatic locks now im stuck in the 'Cedes
With my first three grand, I copped a four and a baby
Then I dropped my first week I did a about 180
That's why my attitude is like fuck you, pay me
Nigga's pockets get slim and they get shady
And you ain't got to ask
You know what im bout'
We agree to disagree
We had a big shoot out
You nigga's talk to much
Don't kill me already
If I was you nigga i would of done it already
My cell phone ringin'
My ice still blingin'
Fuck y'all I got money to get wassup!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & (Jeezy)]
The Rumor has it
That you're back in town
Seen your face
I Heard your name for awhile
(Dope man, dope man)
Everything still the same
People want it, just got to have it! yeah

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my AR copped back, I keep it right on my lap
If you lookin' for me dawg, I'll be right in the trap
If you lookin' for my hands, they'll be right on my strap
I keep my friends close but my enemies closer
All black, forty cal', two clips, no holster
24's on the Phantom, all black no chauffeur
Just a stove in my trap, no beds, no sofas
Now I'm sprayin' Frebreeze just to hide the odor
Keep ya eyes on the window while i mix this soda (Yeaaah)
Get it crackin' I'm the life of the party
But the hatin' nigga's want to leave holes in my body
Wassup!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & (Jeezy)]
The Rumor has it
That you're back in town
Seen your face
I Heard your name for awhile
(Dope man, dope man)
Everything still the same
People want it, just got to have it! yeah

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
I'm from Atlantis Apartments
The area of Atlantis Park
Where lil' guppies sell drugs for titanic sharks
You hear M80s and gigantic shocks
From the jump out van, man them frantic cops
Lil' skateboard sitin' on his skate board
Watch them rob a crew, strategize to make war
Nightline News, this is what you call a Kate Ture
Pavlovian paper chase [it's?] been a long, break boys (uh!)
The fireworks that's the 5-0 and the equipment is right
You see a kite, then that mean it's a new shipment of white
I skated at night, do you still? Not hardly and oddly
I make beats, look good, fuck bitches and parley
I don't party, 'cause that's a another million probably
I wish you could see what I see through the frames of these Cartis
Money to burn niggas, you gotta love it
Sneeze in 50s and wipe my ass with 100s

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & (Jeezy)]
The Rumor has it
That you're back in town
Seen your face
I Heard your name for awhile
(Dope man, dope man)
Everything still the same
People want it, just got to have it! yeah
