I am on a 24 hour purp kush diet
Clubbing while I'm blowing nigga
Maybe you should try it
I'm only just saying this cause I don't have to buy it
My homeboy supply it
That's why I'm on that high shit
I am what everybody in my past still want me to be
You know I saw what everybody in my past didn't what me to see
Damn right I made it
Ask me how I did it
Look I was so committed
God damn, came a long way from [?]
Now I'm here, tell me what can they say though
It's stretching like playdough
We catch it, damn right I'm a beast
Yeah you know I don't play though
Get toast, get toast, no toaster
Till ya'll made of eggo
Get it in, yeah stack it all up
Like a nigga playin lego
Playing pringles
Call me young iTunes
Now used to sell singles
Now bring it all back
Bring it back like that
28 like bingo
Moet used to get so wet
Used to call the girl Nemo, can't lie
Get me hard as a brick
Just call the boy Yayo
She in love, she in love with a dick
See my boy need a halo
Can't lie, got a new bad bitch
Bitch bad like J-Lo

Got a 36 purly white and I ain't talking Colgate
Hands hurt from counting, pardon me while I rotate
They can't help it and I can't blame them
Since I got famous, bitch, just for talking the blow
Getting it in

As soon as the bag come, I'm buying the 10
Talking the blow, blow-oh oh oh, blow-oh, oh,..
Bitch still talking the blow oh, oh, oh, blow-oh, oh, oh
Bitch still talking the blow
