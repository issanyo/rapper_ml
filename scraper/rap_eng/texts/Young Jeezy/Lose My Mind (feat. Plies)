Why yall trippin, I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout dat time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

I'm hearin voices in my head think I'm skitzafrantic
I swear they sayin let's get it from anotha planet
36 a thousand times I'm doin summer saltz
Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off
I'm out my mind, yea a nigga seein double yall
Now tell me what's the chance of jizzle fuckin' both of yall
She said as long as we can do it wit ya ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin to a boss, my goons got goons
How stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms

Why yall trippin, I'm just fine
12:45, bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby (ha), waste 2 stackz
(Aye young dis me bruh bruh) hardest thing in the lot, that there mine
(Hood affiliated baby)
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

Guess wat my momma told me, she hate my patnas
Guess why she hate em though
Cuz all of em robbin'
Fuck da police, cuz all of em problems
White girls fun, cuz all of em swallow
Why I ain't fuck ha at the house, cuz the bitch hollered
And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin
Ol broke azz nigga, stop cock blockin
Security, I need help cuz the bitch stalkin
A half fuckin mill, that's what the whip cost me
One-hundred dollaz, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hatin, that's when the nigga lost me
Fantastico, that's what the hoez, that's what the hoes call me

Why yall trippin, I'm just fine
12:45, bout dat time
Couldn't get it it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind

This shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz
Hardest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

Drop the top, no broad, got ha titties out
Mention my name and bring da whole city out
Doing what I do best, d-boy stuntin
New car, old money, d-boy stuntin
Step in cleaner then a new Glock-40
Nick name in the A, strapped up shawty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothepick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-Code, black shadez and my black chainz
But if you wouldn't undastand, it's a black thing
You kno we drink that rozay til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out

Why yall trippin, I'm just fine
12:45, bout that time
Ain't done it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind

Dis shit crazy, way to bad
Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz
Hardest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind
