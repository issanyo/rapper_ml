[Hook: Nelly]
I got 5000 ones, looking for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm looking for her, I'm looking for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwing it up
I'm looking for her, I'm looking for her
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no

[Young Jeezy]
They call me Young, my money long
I make it rain, now lose your thong
Now lose your bottoms, now lose your tops
You saw what I just spent, I could've bought a watch
I could've bought a car, maybe a couple bricks
I send my hood bitch to Fifths on a shopping trip
5000 ones, yeah, you know Young with it
So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it
Still Mr. Magic City, you know no replacements
This is what I do, I got a pole in my basement
If I can make it to Onyx, I bring Onyx to the condo
Call little bro, bring me 20 grand, pronto
