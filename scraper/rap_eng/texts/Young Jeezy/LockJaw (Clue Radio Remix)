[Intro: DJ Khaled & Jeezy]
This the remix
It be hard to watch the 10 when the haters keep watchin'
Clue, what's happenin'?
Woo, woo
Remix

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana & (Jeezy)]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin' (Straight up)
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin' (Yeah)
I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin' (That's the one)
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin' (Yeah)
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin' (Y'all know what's happenin' nigga)
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin' (Snow)
Bite down, bite down (Low key, this your block)
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin' (Rest in peace, Bankroll Fresh, you know)
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
It be hard to thumb through it when the hundreds keep stickin'
Got some niggas out in Tampa, yeah they payin' Scottie Pippen
In the 'rari, by him damn self, boy, Jeezy trippin'
And it's candy apple red, see I thought that he Crippin'
Y'all gon' have to pardon me, I got haders on my sideline
It's a fact motherfucker, your baby mama on my timeline
Yeah bitch, I run my city like I'm motherfuckin' Prime Time
Prime 1 12, South Beach, I like to fine dine
You rappers on that rap shit, Snow was rich before that
That Draco in the drop top, screamin' free Kodak
She gone off the Xannies, got my hand down her panties
She say her name Lateesha, why I keep on sayin' Tammy

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Know I gotta hold it down, with my dogs, doin' time
Money order's in his name and his daughter's doin' fine
Real estate for the seize, Bo Jackson in his prime
Side line with the heat, Jordan, number 9s
On the first day, she got me 2 pairs of the 3 stripes
Nicki watchin' me and Meek shootin' with 3 dice
Helicopter pads, Ferarris with 3 pipes
Casting call for the models, party for 3 nights
Condos and Corvettes, Quotin' at cheap price
Flow's old school, I'm close to a D Nice
AMA Awards, all the homies seats nice
Lady Gaga seen a boss, didn't even think twice

[Verse 3: Kodak Black & French Montana]
I chew your lil' mup, I'll boot a nigga up
Got them snipers in the dually truck and we tooly'd up
I be tryna change my life , but a monkey on my back
I've been rollin' all night, I got a monkey on my back
(skrrr, skrrr)
All about the mula
Throw a hundred chains on, tryna cool off
I know a nigga blessed, pray to God
Soon as the floor hits my feet I'm getting high
Eyes bowleg, lookin' crooked in the face
She keep lookin' in her drink
Probably think the liquor laced
Nah bitch, I'm 1K
And I'ma keep it one-hund' though
Bitin' down, 'bout to rip my tongue off

[Hook: Kodak Black and French Montana]
It be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
Got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
I ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
She ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
Still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
It be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
It be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
Bite down, bite down
It'd be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
