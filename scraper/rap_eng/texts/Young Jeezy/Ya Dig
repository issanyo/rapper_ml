[Chorus]
Got the Chevy sittin' on 24s (Ya dig!)
Hit the trap and move a couple of them O's (Ya dig!)
Every nigga 'round me sell white (Ya dig!)
Re-up and move the shit in one night (Ya dig!)

Got the Chevy sittin' on 24s (Ya dig!)
Hit the club and grab a couple of them hoes (Ya dig!)
Every nigga 'round me rock ice (Ya dig!)
Re-up and move the shit in one night (Ya dig!)

[Verse 1]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Nah I ain't dancin', I'm just whippin them grams up
Got the stove on medium, I'm cheffing them yams up
Got a nigga waiting at the store, 'nother at my trap house
Weigh it , bag it, tie it, then I smash out!
I betcha can't do it like me (nope!)
Stretch four ways like Laffy Taffy
Bet it come back white, like Fabo's glasses
This is business as usual, I'm a usual suspect
Not Carlito's, but Jeezy's way
You want a 125, and that's easy pay
I'm out, just re'd up yesterday!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Lean wit' it, Rock wit' it
Body rock, body rock, chopper make ya body rock
Monday night, Magic City, throw yo grands on that hoe!
In the club 100 deep throwin' grands on the flo'
Meet me at the mall, it's goin' down
Slick Pulla off probation, bout to clown
Got stacks on deck, and the work around the corner
I still keep it at my auntie house
Get it right, whip the yams, and let the pyrex lean
Can you believe this bitch asked me to see my grill?
They say shawty stay wit' it, she a beast in the bed
My patna turned me on, he said her name was Blockhead (Ha Ha!)

[Chorus]
