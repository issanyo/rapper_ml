(Intro)
A-ayeee (Haha)
A-ayeee (Yaa)

(Hook)
Pass me my mic, soundman get me right
I hope you niggas ready cause it's goin down tonight
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
I got it packed front to back, ohhweee
Look at all these real niggas here that came to see me
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)

(Verse 1)
I heard the hood up in here, well let me hear ya
I see the jack boys lookin, don't make me kill ya
I walk that, talk that, been there, bought that
Dropped this, whipped that, sold this, know that
Feds take pictures, so what Kodaks
That don't stop shit, more work, more stacks
More cars, more clothes, good weed, more hoes
More choppers, more ki's (in them bricks) oh-k
No way Jose, your price too high
No front, cash out, that's right, we buy-
More clubs, more fun, more bottles, more guns
I rob no-one, please sit and have fun

(Hook)
Pass me my mic, soundman get me right
I hope you niggas ready cause it's goin down tonight
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
I got it packed front to back, ohhweee
Look at all these real niggas here that came to see me
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)

(Verse 2)
Yeah these niggas hard, but I'm so much harder
They asked me how I made it, I was so much smarter
Gotta focus on ya strengths, motherfuck ya weaknesses
Y'all know I stay high, so I ain't knowing what week this is
They say "Oh, he's so G", killed that slowly
My swag, my flow, swagger-jackers, y'all know
Believe them, yer dumb, there's only one Young
Since there's only one Young, fuck these niggas come from?
I know, they know, I go so hard
I know, they know, I really sold hard
Full house, packed show, bad bitches, front row
Trap-stars in the back, 87's full of stacks

(Hook, to fade)
Pass me my mic, soundman get me right
I hope you niggas ready cause it's goin down tonight
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
I got it packed front to back, ohhweee
Look at all these real niggas here that came to see me
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
(Tell 'em it's showtime, tell 'em it's showtime)
