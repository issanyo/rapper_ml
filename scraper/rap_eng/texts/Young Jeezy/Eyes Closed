[Verse 1 2 Pistols]
Blood money money by all means
Instead of 2P call me young triple beam
Got fishscale got oil base
Lawyer paid up in case I catch a sell case
Nah I ain't stuntin' them crackas
Magician with the work call it dope boy magic
Dey he go stuntin' again
Top laid back put the dro in the wind
Oh did I mention I was shinin'
Blue, white, yellow, black
Pink diamonds (You already know)
That my favorite line
If your shit shined like mine
You'd say it everytime

[Hook X2]

Frostbit neck, and my wrist froze
You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed
Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds
Shawty shinnin, still grindin

[Verse 2 Young Jeezy]
I know they watchin'
I pose for the photograph
Those indictment papers
Hope you want my autograph
We don't trip, we just live life
Trying to dodge them handcuffs
And them blue lights
Frostbit neck and my wrist froze
You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed
Ask them hoes, with the extra blow
The nigga with the louie luggage down in Mexico
In a A-town fitted cap
I'm so hot tower
I think I need a thermostat
