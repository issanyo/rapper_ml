[Intro]
Fresh up out the shower, smelling like some money
Spent another hour thinking bout some money
These nigga' want the fame, bitch I want some money
See ain't nothing changed, I just want some money
This for them hatin' niggas and them hatin' hoes I can't forget
I been on the Avion all night, you know I'm lit
She say Young  your neck sick look like it need a check up
I say bitch one thing about I try to run the check up

[Verse 1]
My neck's game killin', wrist game killin'
Hop up out this motherfucker smelling like some millions
Right hand cross your heart, other hand to the ceiling
Say bitch I was born broke just know I'm dying with these millions
Wrist game proper, keep that chopper
And take surgery with them squares I play doctor
Go to sleep thinking check, wake up thinking check
[?] Young will not rest till all my niggas get a check
Bitch you know I'm bout it and you know I got it
Like my cars, my bitches and my bitches they exotic
No need for a money counter, we just thumb through it
The 10's and the 5's we just let them ones do it

[Hook]
I say I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up old bitches catch vapours
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I just came [?] I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a [?] 'round my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm [?] up checks

[Verse 2]
I said excuse you superstar in your grey Benz
Tell us how you done it with your right hand
When you chillin' in the strip club, them bands will make her dance
When you standing at the store nigga, [?] don't give a damn
Stretching like yoga, using that soda
Came back 12.50, that's at least an extra quota
Going hard in the paint, Arm & Hammer on my shoulder
Heard you had six hundred horses in your motor
I know that might sound crazy, sound like a stampede
Thought I [?] a Ferrari [?]
Right now I'm thinking check, yesterday I was thinking check
On my way to get a check, still thinkin' 'bout a check

[Hook]
I said I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up [?] bitches catch vapours
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I just came [?] I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a [?] 'round my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm [?] up checks

[Verse 3]
I say I'm tryna run up checks, I'm tryna run up checks
Thirty-two-K gold chain round my neck
Their [?] a little heavy, you might need a massage
If I bought another car I'mma need a new garage
Young you gotta face it, you runnin' outta spaces
You might just have to move [?] Versace suitcases
On the phone with my realtor, bitch about to faint
When she asked me what I'm looking for I told her "bitch a bank"
It's that [?] celler, count it like a teller
Have that white folk runnin' on slippers: Cinderella
I just gotta check, talkin' 'bout a check
So don't ask me the amount, I lost count, I gotta check

[Hook]
I said I want that paper, need that paper
Hustling in my veins, I just bleed that paper
Nothing on my mind but some money: Las Vegas
When you run it up [?] bitches catch vapours
I just wanna check, I just need a check
See I just came [?] I'm thinkin' 'bout a check
Put somethin' in my safe, put a { ?}  'round my neck
That's why I'm always on my grind cause I'm tryna run up checks
