Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash
Catch me on the block in the '07 Jag
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Rubber band 'round my money and my neck full of ice
When you see me on the block, I got it for the right price
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

However you gotta get it, nigga, get that dough
Spit that flow, flip that hoe
Push that dro, or pimp that hoe
You know the work in the house, go kick that door

I make that money, Jizzle, chase that money
Yeah, you know I ball, and I drink that money
All in my sleep, I could taste that money
I go to jail, fuck it, buy the case with the money

When you got the game up, you go waste that money
Let me spit in your face, yeah, show me that ya love me
At the end of the day, a gangster don't trust ya
For money over bitches, can't knock the hustle

Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash
Catch me on the block in the '07 Jag
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Rubber band 'round my money and my neck full of ice
When you see me on the block, I got it for the right price
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

My hustle getting strong, gotta be strong
I hold my whole family down on, on
I'm in the rap game helpin' on as one of the thugs
And the faith on my click, we only smoking the drugs

See this year I'm doing a rave, last year I did purps
This year I want stick, last year I got a dub
Pass me the bud, let me give you a sweet
Pass me the cush, let me take the heat

Pass me a beep, I don't recall what's next
Ya, I left you the other day, gon' go get another chick
He deserves sick, but the strips okay
She's appreciate whenever she get K

Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash
Catch me on the block in the '07 Jag
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Rubber band 'round my money and my neck full of ice
When you see me on the block, I got it for the right price
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Whether it's hoes on the strip or bricks on the street
One thing for sure is a nigga gon' eat
One thing for sure is a nigga gon' get it
Show me a sweet hustle, B Gizzle gon' hit it

Chopper City, the business, how you think I made it double?
I hustled and I struggled and I hustled and I struggled
Can't be ending now, real niggas never stop
Quit, I think not, man, I do it for the block

I was still hot, running shit through the pot
Now I'm on it like, gimme that number one spot
Wanna learn how to grind, sit back and watch
I'm a Spiderman, from the bottom to the top

Hundred grand in my bag, steady getting cash
Catch me on the block in the '07 Jag
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Rubber band 'round my money and my neck full of ice
When you see me on the block, I got it for the right price
'Cause I hustle, hustle, hustle
Watch my hustle, hustle, hustle

Oh shit
What did we do to that motherfucker?
But on that note, I'm keeping his money
I'm hustling, nigga, you gotta hustle like me
Chill, chill, chill
