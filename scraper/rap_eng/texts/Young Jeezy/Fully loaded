[Intro: Young Jeezy]
I told her take off work, call in sick
Give me some of that, I give you some of this
Let it all out, I’mma put all in
Now she on the telephone, tellin’ all her friends

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
Oh baby this evening, you know you better let me in
I wanna give you this feeling
That you’ve been missing
But for now we came here to party
And then we going to the after party
You fully loaded, don’t hurt nobody
I hope you got a permit for that body

[Verse 1: Verse Simmonds]
Little black dress, six inch pumps
Girls night out, looking for the fun
You’re not the type to go so hard
But no one knows how drunk you are
Looking at me, looking at you
I know what you wanna do
Girl I want you now and later
Come hop on my elevator
You’re so dangerous
Hot top, like a smoking gun, na na na
Sexy, and when I hold you in my hands
I know that you special
And I don’t wanna let go
Oh baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
If I told you come jump on this thang
What would you do?
If you can have anybody here, who would you screw?
Dark skin tatted up nigga draped up in this gold
Three words for the way I do it, out of control
The shit that be strapped niggas talk I’m really bout that
Nigga really doin’ what he said, I really doubt that
Dom P sparklers and bottles and good liquor
Thats the recipe to get to the sex quicker
No quickies, no vickies
Gotta get home to your man with no hickies
See you got the Louie Voutons on leave on your heels
I’mma ride it like a new set of Forgiato wheels
Whats up?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Verse Simmonds]
With you cutie is the only point of view
And out of all those girls in here
I see you
Not the typical, that’s something I can get used to
It’s whatever you want
That’s what we can do
Cause you’re so
You’re so dangerous
Hot top, like a smoking gun, na na na
Sexy and when I hold you in my hands
I know that you special
And I don’t wanna let go

[Hook]
