Turn The Lights Down A Little Bit
Turn My Mic Up A Lil Bit

Here I Stand A Grown Ass Man
All By Myself A Grown Ass Man
A Young Nigga With Some Grown Ass Plans
Don't Point Fingers, You Don't Know That Man
You Dont Know Whats Hard
You Dont Know Whats Pain
You Ain't Lookin Through That Scope
You Dont Know Its Aim
Minus All The Videos Stickers And Flyers
Most Of These Rappers Are Compulsive Liars
