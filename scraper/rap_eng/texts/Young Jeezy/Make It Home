I don't always do what I should
But I do what I gotta do
You've been at the bottom, you see the hunger inside of you
Don't say what you won't do
Cus it can all change
When the going gets tough it'll drive you insane
See I done dodged a couple shots
Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops
A broke a couple rules
Didn't graduate from school
Cus I was busy hustling, man, I thought that shit was cool

See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cus the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap
Cus we really know that we don't want that

But if I don't make it home tonight
Tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother
Girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight
Take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas
Cus where I'm from
Niggas outchea dyin every day
And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way
And I ain't no different
So if I get missin
These are my last wishes
I hope you get them right
Girl if I don't make it home tonight

I know it's harsh
But this is how I feel, girl it's comin from the heart
I hope it doesn't end the way it had to start
Cus it started out bad but I made it this far
But everyone here ain't trynna see me make it
Or they only wanna see me win so they can take it
Cus I know it's hard to find a job
So niggas kill and rob
There's a chance that I won't make it here tomorrow
Being honest

See I gotta keep it real with you baby
Cus the shit I used to do is what made me
And I'm hopin I ain't gotta go back to the trap
Cus we really know that we don't want that

But if I don't make it home tonight
Tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother
Girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight
Take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas
Cus where I'm from
Niggas outchea dyin every day
And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way
And I ain't no different
So if I get missin
These are my last wishes
I hope you get them right
Girl if I don't make it home tonight

Would you miss me? Would you miss me?
Would you walk up to my casket? Would you kiss me?
My life is schizophrenic, I'm just tryna stay sane
Pour a cup full, hope it take away the pain
I said you know I I I I
Came from the projects, nigga
Don't care if it kill me, I die, I'll stay in the projects
You know I'm fresh as a motherfucker, in case that I die tonight
Got a lot on my mind, you know that I'm high tonight
I left that black Hublot at home
So really I don't got the time
My nigga got by a quarter, heard that he dropped the dime
Failure's no option nigga, you out of yo fuckin mind
Mixin my life and my freedom fool
So ain't none of you stopping my...

But if I don't make it home tonight
Tell my mama that I love her
Leave some flowers for my brother
Girl I love ya
But if I don't make it home tonight
Take some money to my sister
I don't ever want her chasin after niggas
Cus where I'm from
Niggas outchea dyin every day
And they ain't no bad, ain't they just tryna make a way
And I ain't no different
