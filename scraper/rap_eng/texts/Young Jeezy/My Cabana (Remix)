[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Light the swishers', bring the bottles, been on my grind, stacking mills
I need all my real bitches to put your hands in the ceiling
This the remix, bad bitches gotta feel us
You already ready know a real nigga in the building
D-boy, used to sell coke
Black Rolls Royce, I swear it float
Got some Howard bitches and they all fine
When I’m in DC they all mine
My Cali bitches, they just wanna smoke
Them Dayton County bitches got that deep throat
My Brooklyn bitch she just wanna ball
Have her orgasm when she see the mall
Drunk bitches like me in all black
She grab my chains while I hit it from the back
My Houston bitch like to pop mollies
And take her clothes off like she workin’ for it
This my cabana, yeah…

[Hook]
My cabana, my cabana, my cabana
How many girls can I fit in
My cabana, my cabana, my cabana
How many hoes, hoes

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
White girls love to do coke
Black girls always want to smoke
Asian hoes like to drink sake
My Spanish bitch want to pop a molly
My top ten bitches wear Chanel
I hate bitches wearing fake nails
Dumb bitches think I can't tell
She got butt pads on that's a fail (that's a fail)
Them Greystone girls all 10's
Them ugly hoes can't get in
Hundred bottles every weekend
The bitch on drugs peakin'

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
Nah nah, nah nah
La da da di da di da daaah
Nah nah, nah nah
La da da di da di da daaaaaah
Oh Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign
Dolla
