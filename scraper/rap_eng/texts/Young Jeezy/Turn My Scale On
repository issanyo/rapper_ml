Chorus (2x)
Hopped up out the bed
Turn my scale on
Took a look at the work and say wussup
Yeah we gettin money

Verse 1:
They say the hood looking for you
Time to bounce back
You gotta feed the streets, Young
It’s in your contract
Right here, page 1, paragraph 3
Do what the fuck you wanna do, nigga
Just feed the streets
Remember when I tried to pay 28 bands
Had the nerve to be short 28 grams
I’m gonna need to check your folks
Somebody stole one
Say what the fuck you wanna say
Somebody owe him one

Good dick, tatoos, bitches like that
Talk to em any kind of way
The bitches like that
They say its all about the fit
I say the right hat
They say its all about the kicks
I say the right stack

Chorus (2x)

Verse 2:
I feel like stuntin tonight
Got all my chains on
Nigga you ain't said shit
Thats my theme song
And if you ain't gettin money
Then your themes wrong
And if you ain't dream livin
Then your dreams wrong
White floors, white brick
Thats my dream house
100 bricks the long way
Thats my dream couch
Can you imagine me just sittin on them shits
Wait for the drought to roll around
And make a killing on them shits

Man its such a beautiful day
Do some lawn work
?
T hats why my arm hurts
23 for the B
That’s that Lebron work,
Home invaders
I don’t know my alarm work

Chorus

Turn the scale on
Turn the scale on
