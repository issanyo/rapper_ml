[Intro]
Grind never stop man
I don't give a fuck how much money you got my nigga
I don't give a fuck how rich you is nigga
You still gotta hustle
It's a holiday everyday nigga

[Hook]
I got hustlin' on my resume
I didn't think they'd never ever hear the hustler's say
(That he didn't wanna hustle no more)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
And this a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it never ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more

[Verse 1]
We hustle on our birthdays, we hustlin' on Christmas
Don't care if it's my worst day, the kid gone get their cream up
Got eyes on the prize, yeah, eye of the tiger boy
If we talkin' hustlin' you know who the messiah boy
What a hustler need a bed for? I ain't tryna lay down
When you on the come up, all I know is stay down
You don't see me at the club nigga
I don't see you at the bank though
When I walk up in that bank nigga
I walk in through that back door
I can't lie, I love the grind
I can't even stay awake
Here you go, I love you momma
I even hustle on mother's day
Kept me hustlin' Thanksgivin'
Stack it like a black Jew
Just know today a holiday for hustlin' niggas like you

[Hook]
I got hustlin' on my resume
I didn't think they'd never ever hear the hustler's say
(That he didn't wanna hustle no more)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
And this a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it never ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more

[Verse 2]
Hustle Monday through Monday
And we ain't missin' one day
We all gone be rich one day
Put that on God on Sunday
If you lazy bitch, stay away
We even hustle on Labor Day
And I ain't been home all week
I wonder what the neighbors say
Ain't no such thing as "I can't"
If I want I get that
They talkin' bout how you fell off
When it's all about how you get back
Hustle every minute, every hour
Shit can go from sweet to sour
Right from sour back to sweet
You just practice what you preach
We don't do no vacays
We hustle every day nigga
Just send you on that vacay
We count our paper, pray nigga
Hustlers don't get no sleep
You niggas stay sleeping
I've been griding all week
I'm hustle at weekends

[Hook]
I got hustlin' on my resume
I didn't think they'd never ever hear the hustler's say
(That he didn't wanna hustle no more)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
And this a hustlin' holiday
Wouldn't make it never ever hear a hustler say
That he don't wanna hustle no more
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
