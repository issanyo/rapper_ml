[Hook – Slick Pulla]
Me and my man do our thing with the splits
Now we coming down, matching feet, matching whips
Drop it in the [?] watch it come back to chips
Now we lockinb down the block, this like [?]
We don’t break shit, one week we gon get that
Bad bitches, double em up, we gon hit that
Pass a gram of sand, we gon spit that
That real D boy lingo, we gon kick that
Yeah, for real

[Verse 1 – Slick Pulla]
Fourway on my feet
The kid go hard for the money
You sweet ass niggas want the honey
Treat them things like the homies, yeah we keep em moving
A bass mouth in the coupe, I’m tryna get some chewing
If you ain’t cashing plugs out then what the fuck you doing
Like John Travolta when it come to a Olivia Newton
Snow put me up on game, showed me how to push it
Now I’m in Texas playing big like my name Cushing
Corner the market, massive distribution
Met a new sick chain, got them hoes puking
And the loafers clean, nice, suede
And the linen shirts perfect cause the boy’s paid
In full

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Jeezy]
Chain so big it look monkey
Addicted to this cash, I’m a motherfucking junkie
Niggas mad cause I passed, and they motherfucking flunkies
If it’s really like that fuck nigga, then slug me
Came invalidated, I didn’t need no validation
Pope to the streets, I’m the leader of a nation
I took my cane and my pain and my other mindframe
And I told em bout the game and accumulated fame
Told you back with Fab on do the damn thang
If the number on the right, I can move the damn thang
And the, coupe’s clean and the top’s suede
And the F&N working cause your boy’s paid
I’m full

[Hook]
