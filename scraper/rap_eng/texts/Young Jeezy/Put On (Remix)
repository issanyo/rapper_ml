[Intro: Young Jeezy]
I Put On x3

[Verse 1: ApolloX]
I put on when these bitches get to trippin I think they be fucking snitching
When they do it, it'll be fluid
So I guess I got something to say and that is the things that you do everyday will be counting on your city so make it fucking count cause
I put on for my city every motherfucking day
Them fuckers staying in the fray
They gonna have to go away
If they don't then I'll make em fly far far away
And they gonna die today cause I don't give care what they say
You know who I am my name ApolloX but I'ma pass the mic to the next his name is Mistik, the next best one in this booth
If you wanna argue then go fucking pull a tooth
Don't care anyway so go suck off that doofus
Recession came in now you gonna die another day
Another way
Couldn't give two fuck if you wanted to say some stupid things
Now, what you gonna do now
You know you gonna lose now
Then what I do after that is I Put On

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
I Put On for my city
On, On, For my city
I Put On for my city
On, On, For my city

(2 Mistik) Yeah Nigga

[Verse 2: 2 Mistik]
I put on for my city ever since I was young
Ain't nobody fucking with me cause I stay strapped with a gun
No nigga thought I could cause I came straight from the hood
Haven't seen the things I seen
I guess life isn't what it seems
Now look at me I'm living all of my dreams this is destiny
To compete up to the realist niggas in this game nigga
Life is insane nigga
Flock a flames nigga
When these niggas dissin they start to think I be trippin
But I gotta say what's on top of my mind iv been hustlin and grindin ever since I was nine all these niggas think I'm fake but I leave it up to faith every night I pray about looking back up to this day

[Verse 3: ApolloX]
If you want to get in the booth then go do it your way
Our way is sitting in a closet and recording
So don't let no one tell you what you gotta do
All you gotta do is go find something to motherfucking cool off
Now, Listen to me when I say its gonna fall on you when you say its going through
Don't have much time left
So ill have to say this in a very short way and what I gotta say is
You gonna have to put on for you city

[Hook]
