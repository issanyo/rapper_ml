Whoever said "trap or die", well, I'm fucking with that
Now they looking at me crazy like I've done it with crack
I told them all down, yeah, I've done it with stacks
Sometimes, I ride by myself, just me and my strap
That boy Young Jizzle, he so ill
He's straight up out the hood, how he get him a deal?
And now the gotta deal with me
And I ain't vouching for you niggas, yeah, you mysteries
As I stack my cheese, run through my Kraft
Or should I say Velveeta, it's all the same
I'm talking big chips, nigga, just like tacos
Stack the all up, nigga, just like nachos
Smoke good every day, yeah, the boy got flavor
Made a little money, now the boy got haters
It's okay 'cause the boy keep choppers
Stay a hundred deep, yeah, the boy got partners
Now, tell me I ain't sell that white
Bedtime for you lame ass niggas, good night
