[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Young done jumped on that G-mix
100 like 3 bricks
O's dropping like bird shit
Young back on that bird shit
Shooters behind me in that Benzo
Young pull up in that Enzo
Red rarri got 2 doors
Cost a million, want 2 more
2 seaters, got 3 hoes
Florida bitch she got 3 golds
Speaking of shots lets take one
20 bands and then take one
Young nigga you crazy
Fuck you doing in Little Haiti?
100 deep, maybe 80
All these motherfuckers crazy
Duncan Block is what raised me
Thats why niggas can't phase me
Whole hood on that blue shit
While I was riding around in that new shit
100 grand in my pockets, 50 bands in my motors
Dark side of my chauffeur, shirt off with my toaster
All you see is my tattoos, all you see is my big chains
Right up under that Versace belt, all you see is that big thang
87 be the logo, been getting ask Polo
Long money that hurt shit, 2 and a baby that bird shit
Mama called she want a new place
Homeboy just caught a new case
Leave the room just bought a new safe
Audemar just got a new face
Blowing that Obama
Riding around with that llama
Solid gold's my uzi
Free my nigga Lil Boosie
