(Cannon)

(Verse 1)
Guess whos bizzack
Still smell the blow on my clothes
Like crispy cream i was cooking them o's
Like horseshoes i was tossin them o's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
Im emotional
I hug the block
Im so emotional
I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me
So whats realer
Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa
Its kinda hard to be drug free
When george and pie won't give a n***a lights free
Switched hustles been killin em ever since
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense

(Chorus)
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my colar then i swing my chain
If you catch me in the club pimpin doing my thang
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
They pop my colar then they swing they chain
All the gangstas in the street that be doin they thang

(Verse 2)
Won't stop till my whole team in thug mansion
And i sell like pac
Thats a thugs passion
And this the realest shit i ever wrote
And all eyes on me like a microscope
Young jeezy give em one more chance
They try to spit like you and get your whole advance
Like my main man pulla talk real slick
Look im ok but my watch sick
You dont gotta like a n***a
Just respect my mind
This is how im eatin now
So respect my grind
The way i put them words together
Reminds me about how i put them byrds together

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Buy 18 the hard way
Now have a younger n***a thinkin bout gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns
Alotta hoes alotta drugs dog
That shit ain't fun
So i suggest that u dont play with my chain
Or ill send these hollow's at you
Let them play with ya brain
The streets is watchin
The name is warn
The products white
A star is born
Pimpin im so fly
I take this parachute off
I might fall and die
Wrap the work with spandex with the latex
Then we ship it outta town
Call it safe sex

(Chorus)
