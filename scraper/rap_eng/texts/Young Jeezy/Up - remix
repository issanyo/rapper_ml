[Young Jeezy]
I'm just chillin' in that Phantom bumpin that Yo Gotti
He's the boss of the town, call him young John Gotti
Sittin down with the plug, bout to order up some taco's
Talkin' velveeta hella chips, nachos
And you really gettin' money, say cheese in this muthafucka
Bitches on your dog like fleas in this muthafucka
So many chains might freeze in this muthafucker
Walked past a bitch like breeze in this muthafucka
Black and gold stones, Drew Brees in this muthafucka
Don't make me start talking quarter keys in this muthafucker
Shell cases, night vision, ain't nothing stupider
Clips filled up, outta space, Jupiter
Don't make me start it up like a new Kawasaki
Drop me, hit ya in ya face, you'll be chicken teriyaki
While I'm on that new thug passion, that Belvedere and Saki
Chopping bricks with some chop sticks, i told you i got this

[Chorus]
You know they mad cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You ain't never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm who they be, Chronic by the P, living comfortably
Come with me, round and some would see why they fuck with me
Bentley's pulling up in three, multi-coloured fleet
Y'all sour me, my summers sweet
Kiss my mother feet
Hate just makes chop em as they creek
Life forever sweet
Life's a gamble and I play for keeps in these streets
Magnificant flow or magnifique
Rookie have a seat
Them lil niggas just my parakeets
Macking masterpiece
My life is good, my bitches bad
I'm switching pads, changing watches in my christmas bag
I got the gift of gab, talked my way in and took some ass
Whips and cash, come through half stepping and then get whipped in half
Southsides my heart, too hard to forget the past
Lost too many niggas (?) keep the liquor stashed
My flows off the ropes, uppercuts, stick to jabs
Shorty wanna grab, catch a couple nuts, hit the cab

[Chorus]
You know they mad cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You ain't never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Kanye West]
We keep these G's in an alloy safe
And stash the weed in an altoids case
They say good things come to those who wait
So I'm gon be at least an hour late
I'm so fresh I should be arrested
New Tody Chester with my nuts on your chest bitch
She said "hey 'Ye"
I said "Yes Bitch"
Damn I'm only asking you a question
I met this milf at the allstar getting action
A cougar with more rings than Phil Jackson
Told her beauty is why God invented eyeballs
And her booty is why God invented my balls
I'm a rockstar, huh, start it up
Start it up, huh, start it up
So popular you should get a shot of us
Niggas gon take shots at us that is only obvious
The first album I vomited, the second I colonic'd it
Ain't nobody fucking with me, I plutonic'd it
Bet I got some slippers on, bet niggas gon honor it
These ain't even real clothes homie I'm pajama rich
Banks told me homie go switch the style up
These bitches on me homie only to arouse us
Told her I ain't paying tonite I'm only browsing
She pulled her blouse up, said "it's free", I said WOWZER!

[Chorus]
You know they mad cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You ain't never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute

[Swizz beatz]
Ninja, Kawasaki, Ducati, my old Harley
Rock the party
Move ya body
Wassup, wassup
Everybody
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Start it up (vroom, vroom)
Wait a minute
[Ryan Leslie]
Lets get it started, get it started, get it started yeah yeh
Ladies and gentleman
[Fabolous]
Plenty hate, they be taking shots, never penetrate
Money generated, if we ain't in the house, renovate!
Tryna eat, we ain't finna wait
Where's da dinner plates?
BMW, ten to 8, interstate 95, passenger
Baddest bitch in the states, half Spanish half trinidad
Complexion Henny straight
Y'all ain't got your business straight, track star, finna state
Time is money and I can't afford to be a minute late
It's time to make a movie let the haters watch
Diamonds spinning round the bezel thats tornado watch
My independant chick, I like my ladies Koch
She got an appetite for dick, I guess I place my crotch
That soft as tater top, long, try me not
Under the wings, fried rice at the chinese spot
I hear 'em talking it but they ain't really living it
Opinions are like assholes so who gives a shit

[Chorus]
You know they mad cause cause cause I'm hood rich
You ain't never ever seen good trick
You want a problem
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Start it up (vroom vroom)
Wait a minute
