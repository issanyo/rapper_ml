[Intro: 2 Chainz]
I got me more blocks than Dikembe (x4)

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Fuck what you think
I fuck with them niggas thats sipping that drank and, smoking that loud
Getting so much money I should just live in a bank
I whip it like Kinte [?]
It might be a Benz day
I got me more blocks than Dikembe
I got me more blocks that Dikembe, ay okay (x4)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Did it for the summer, married to the game, smoking marijuana
If you fucked my baby mama then it's "Fuck my baby mama!"
I see death around the corner so I bust a Uey
You need popcorn for this movie
I've been a grown man since Juvie
Might spit on a nigga like a loogie
As a matter of fact, you gon' need a fat machine
Pockets so fat, I'ma need a racks machine
I said "Lord, have mercy, these hoes thirsty"
I'm riding around with my friday ho, not your ho, cause she's so thirsty
That old news, put it in the house, put a code blue
Get on Pro Tools and ride a motherfucker like an old school
The bitches im with is so bad, she aye okay
I'm whipping that work into glass, this aye okay
I'm getting that chips, turning that shit into frito lay
She left the room, I told her she owe me like 6 to 8
Shitting me, better get your shit straight
Been had a million dollar, made it off a mixtape

[Hook: 2 Chainz]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I live on the block with a two way, came back with the doors up
Came back with so many blocks y'all, fill the back of a whole truck
I don't know shit about these rappers
I do not live like these rappers, nah
You can call me the OT
I am the Original Trapper
See me sliding in, riding in something
Then you know the shit major
Talking about something so [?] man
Something so fruity man, nigga CJ might be gay
Nigga i've been grinding so long
Nigga hustling so long
Middle name might need to be paper
Gotta have a whole lot of blocks or a whole lot of M's
To live around here ask my neighbors, yeah
I am not talking about Fader when I say it came with a magazine
What he got in his ears, fuck he got in his ears
Don't it look like some tangerines
Got a bitch out in Cali, more keys than a valet
Get to streching that shit, get to whipping that shit, type of nigga to make the block do ballet
Yeah
