[Intro]
You know what it is when I do this
Come through I have these niggas asking where the roof is
Call the camera man tell him hurry we can shoot this
40 on the seal swear to God don't make me shoot this

[Hook x2]
How you want it, hard or soft
Get 'em in, get 'em off
AR, flat screens in the front room
Quarter bricks, half things in the back room

[Verse 1]
It's over for 'em, the real back
Niggas ain't running shit they can kill that
Kill that, yeah, funeral home
Take the brick out the casket yeah funeral home
How you want it, the more the merrier
Long she ain't been touched like the Virgin Mary
Got that bullshit step, it's been stepped on
If you people show you that then they dead wrong
Call them niggas up, get your money back
Come holla at yo boy, get this Cadillac
In and out the back door, lock the dead bolt
Bout to flood the whole block, need a sail boat

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Cut the air condition on set the microwave
Chance to make it out slimmer than some micro-braids
How you want it, it's on the stove now
When you want it, it's one the road now
Glade plugins, whole house stink
Feds run up in here, the whole house faint
Passed out countin' twenties, wake me up please
Running water in the kitchen, need some jet skis
Take the fork in the water, that's a water spoke
Y'all know I'm bullshitting, that's my water joke
You know this shit funny you can laugh nigga
They show up with that search warrant that's yo ass nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Money coming, money going
Serve my out of town niggas yeah that money foreign
Said the Latin niggas servin that pretendo
We don't play them type of games, yeah nintendo
Y'all don't give a fuck weigh it on your iPad
If it's anything over then it's my bad
Thousand five, thousand eight
That's a new pair of Js another thousand straight
You know it's jumping out the bowl nigga gumbo
Coming back stupid big I'm talking Dumbo
Tell em meet me at the honeycomb hideout
Bumblebee Lambo, honeycomb ride out

[Hook x2]
