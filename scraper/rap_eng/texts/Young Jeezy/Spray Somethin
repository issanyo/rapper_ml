CHORUS:
G shit is all I do, dirt by my lonely
Thuggin is all I do, I keep that thing on me
Ain't no workin it out, I gotta get this change
All I know how to do is get this change
I told him bring it all, if he ain't bring it all
Ima leave that nigga layin there
I might just have to spray somethin baby (spray spray somethin baby)
Home got me fucked up, I am not with it
Dont matter what the target, AK’ll hit it
Who gives a fuck, call the ambulance to come get it
Then its back to the (money) dont stop get it get it
Hold up, slow down, speed up
Nigga the 12 right behind us just put the weed up
We got guns in this bitch, we got funds in this bitch
20s stacked up like 1’s in this bitch
50s stacked up like blocks in this ho
Thats probably why its smellin like blocks in this ho
You know im tryin to eat, so a nigga ridin dirty
It ain't even lunch time, its just eleven thirty
CHORUS
When it goes down, I hope my shit dont jam
Reason I get hit, I be god damned
Keepin my soldiers on deck incase we go to war
120 deep like we bought to do it too
Yeaaaaa, pull up in firelane trucks
And they all coffee black, nigga starbucks
Had it crackin like the drive thru at mickey D’s
Instead of fries theys pickin up them quarter ki’s
Who you with mother fucker this ya roll call
Keep them 50 shots with me, them my road dogs
Know what they say, if ya get caught with no vest
CHORUS
Then its RNG shit with no test
