(feat. Slim Thug & Bun B)

[Slim Thug:]
Yeah, Slim Thugga, the motha fuckin boss
(It's southern smoke you heard me)
Bosshog outlawz boyz in blue
(Southern smoke nigga)
More money more problems I'm back in court
Baby momma tryin to stick me with that child support
White folks tryin to hang a nigga bitch make me sick
That's what I get for thinkin with my dick
Man these hoes are scandalous
Niggas are snakes
They glidin on my pocket like I'm their big break
I be a damn fool to think shit all good
They lookin at a nigga like they take it out the hood

Man big southern smoke (southern smoke) niggas jackin my slang
I got a feel on these niggas they ain't actin the same
Album ain't even dropped still considered a rookie
And niggas already out here catchin that pussy
Cause I'm makin what they make in an hour
That's why I got the club takin champagne showers
Switch cars every season hundred thousand or better
I got addicted to the smell of new leather
H-town transcend a niggas follow my lead
They try to catch up but can't follow my speed
Bosshog outlawz run the motha fuckin city man
Call me down to southle with it man
Fuck what you think and fuck how you feel
We gettin paid down here nigga it's fo real
The feds want a hotter nigga cause I'm livin large
I got a million worth of cars up in the garage
Dope game make the same down in texas
Boyz gettin knockin straight get to talkin reckless
Quick to takin street fame and riches
But can't take their charge so they quick to start snitchin
So excuse me if I seem a little cautious
But it's a lot of niggas tryin to knock down us bosses
I'm dodgin crosses rollin along
One deep with the chrome is the boss I'm gone

Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth
Re up on the first and again on the fifth
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga
And all these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga

[Young Jeezy:]
(Southern smoke)
[? ] on the block rain sleet no sunny
Slow motion don't [? ] money
Trap all day with no lunch breaks
It's to the time for the gangsta cookin pancakes
Rubberbands when we wrapped em stack
Time to ship it outta town you know saran's the wrap
Think ahead in case them k-9's get loose
Inner tubes like the tires on my mongoose

Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth
Re up on the first and again on the fifth
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga
And all these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga

[Bun B:]
(Southern smoke)
Yeah back up in the hood again
Wheres it all good again
Ridin candy slabs grippin on the wood again
Out of line niggas get back in place where you should have been
In case you don't understand I'm a make it understood again
King of the underground my gangsta will never fail
You bout to make me go postal for fuckin with my mail
Yeah you got the connect but you ain't got the clintel
You a jokes and niggas know it this shit ain't hard to tell
Rat bitch recognize that your cheese ain't fin to sell
See I'm fin to break some bread with the feds you dumb as hell
I've been around the block before sold it off and rocked the blow
And I don't fuck around when them feds in town I gots to go
Respect my mind cause I'm a trill old schoola
Summer time get to hot I wait for winter when it's coola
UGK for life free the pimp you know the deal
If P.A.T. is trap or dyin and we ain't down for gettin killed?

Smoke purp by the pound goose by the fifth
Re up on the first and again on the fifth
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga
And all these hoes love a nigga cause they know that we the truth
Got the chevy same color tropicana orange juice
(Yeaaaah)
We trap or die nigga
We trap or die nigga
