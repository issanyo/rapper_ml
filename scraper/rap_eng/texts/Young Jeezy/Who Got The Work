[Intro: DJ Drama]:
4 times? 4 mixtapes? And we 4 times platinum? We still got the work! I got it! CTE got it! (laughter)

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
We got the bread, nigga, who got the work?
(x4)
What's happenin?

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]:
There's no business like snow business, you see?
And your business like slow business
You been on that same bag damn near two weeks
What, you a day-care, nigga? Babysitting the yams?
Is your name Keith Sweat? Make it Last Forever?
You can call me Babyface: I got the that whip appeal (Ha-Ha!)
Get it? Haha, whip appeal! Ziplock the o's; a half a brick in the stove
School of hard knocks, I majored in chemistry
So you know I passed with flying colors!
My wrist iced out, so my arms is cold
Shit jumpin' out the gym, call it Armor All (Ha-Ha!)

[Hook]
