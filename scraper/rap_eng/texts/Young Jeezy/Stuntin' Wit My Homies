Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What we doin'? Gettin' money
So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga
Jezzy the boss

I'ma psychic motherfucker, yeah, I can see ya future
Rap about me and a nigga might shoot ya
Serve the wrong nigga and the Fed's might swoop ya
Just bring a hundred K and a lot might coupe ya

Tryin' to drive me crazy like them boys Gnarls Barkley
Mad 'cause my paper stand is tall like Charles Barkley
CTE motherfucker we ain't nothin' like them other niggas
Try to sip it, you'll be over like that other nigga

I don't fuck with buster nigga either or sucker niggas
Loud talkin', ass pussy, motherfucker niggas
Licks on the wheels, same color as the car, bitch
Trap star shit, 'round my way, we call it lipstick

And you is a dipshit, for actin' like a dipstick
Automatics 'round here but you can get ya gearshift
Ballin' in charge, late bull, I'm ridin' dead on
White on white image, snowmizzy in the middle, what's up?

Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What we doin'? Gettin' money
So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga
Jezzy the boss

CTE, motherfucker
I'ma stunner like my homies, stunner like my homies
Stunner like my homies
CTE, motherfucker
I'ma stunner like my homies, stunner like my homies
Stunner like my homies

Lookin' for the rightest, tell them boys fired up
Pussy niggas hatin' on us, better keep that mouth shut
CTE the clique, bitch, still on some real shit
Niggas 'bout that monkey business, feed their ass banana clips

Standin' like I'm runnin', so we ridin' new cars
What they doin'? Hatin' on us, still at the Vibe Awards
Young nigga, filthy rich, Jezzy got a bad bitch
Yeah, that's my thing, homie, flippin' like a sidekick

Hittin' like drummer boy, hit 'em when their comin', boy
Panoramic sunroof, shitin' on them other boys
Used to come get us, charge us, what's happenin'?
Ridin' on 22's, we don't ride with used Magnums

Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What we doin'? Gettin' money
So I gotta floss, CTE still a label, nigga
Jezzy the boss

CTE, motherfucker
I'ma stunner like my homies, stunner like my homies
Stunner like my homies
CTE, motherfucker
I'ma stunner like my homies, stunner like my homies
Stunner like my homies

Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What they doin'? Hatin' on 'em
Chromed out 4-5, what you doin'? Hatin' on 'em
What they doin'?
