[Hook: Yo Gotti]
It's a new year, I can think clear
$1000 shades, I can see clear
European made, motor in the rear
Gettin' the phone tapped, Feds gettin' near
Near, near, Feds on a sweep
Shut the trap down, moved it down the street
Kush super strong, Jakes took the pier
I'm multi-nominated, Gangsta of the Year
Year, year, Gangsta of the Year
Multi-nominated, Gangsta of the Year
Year, year, Gangsta of the Year
Year, year, Gangsta of the Year

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
All I rock is white, bitch, I'm cocaine crazy
First check I cashed was like a half of mill' from Baby
Love for my homies, don't give a damn 'bout a lady
125 grams, that's four and a baby
20 cent 50, shooters coming with me
Body hit the ground and your soul be uplifted
Beat break down, them racks add up
And all these haters actin' mad at us
Gangsta of the Year, and I don't want a trophy
I just want these fuck niggas to pay me what they owe me
Gangsta of the Year and I don't mean to brag
But the title with the tags is 200 on the dash

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Gangsta of the world, know I'm nominated
Bring it home every year, my own mama hate it
Twelve hundred on my face, velour, Versace shots
I left my filling on her face, yeah that Versace top
I'm the last man standing, bitch, I need a trophy
So much bread in my pocket, bitch, I'm feeling toasty
Heard them snitch niggas singing, yeah, that karaoke
Don't fuck with police-ass niggas, bitch, don't even approach me
Don't you niggas know you can't stop a moving train?
Look at me now, getting paper, still moving, mane
Ship it up in your face just like Benihana
Told that bitch she make it back, I'll buy the bitch a Honda
And I ain't see 'em move shit, call me Jeezy Wonder
If ain't nobody vouching for him, that make Jeezy wonder
Gangsta of the Year, human chandelier
Would tell you, feel my pain, you might shed a tear

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Jadakiss]
Yo - I'm really in the 'hood, all they do is pass through
So hands down I've been a winner for the past few
I got the work to prove it and I got the cash, too
A couple niggas still breathing, guess they passed due
That ain't no surprise, sitting on these pies
LB, millionaires, sitting on his eyes
We at the table sipping red and we puffing Cubans
I done made a bunch of bread with a couple Cubans
Yeah, you got a bunch of guns but you never use 'em
Everybody get a run, is you win or losing?
Shut the trap down - nothing moving
Gangsta of the Year 'til they nominate a new one (what's up?)

[Hook]
