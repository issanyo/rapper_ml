I'm killing these niggas man this shit ain't fair
Give me the death penalty the electric chair
I'm in an electric coupe
With the electric roof
Its electric blue
With the electric top, Just gives me a rush yeah electric shock
And that mother fucker Crip'N got that navy seats
Catch me riding round town with a navy piece
Got the FN rifle yeah that navy heat ha ha
She gone off that goose told me call her cranberry
I traded in the scale for a new blackberry
I'm so confident damn right i'm so sure
A hood nigga straight turned entrepreneur
I'm killing these niggas

The games in trouble but helps on the way
This for my niggas that move a brick every day ( i am killing these niggas)
Still the realist nigga in it thats all i can say
When on the highway this is what you play ( i am killing these niggas)
The games in trouble but helps on the way
This for my niggas that move a brick every day (i am killing these niggas)
Still the realist nigga in it thats all i can say

I gave em everything i had yeah thats all i got
And if that ain't enough then give me back my pot
Give me back my block, give me back my life
Give me back my days, give me back my ways
Why pay to get it catered i can chef it myself
Why let em get the extras i can stretch it myself

I guess love go with hate thats apart of the game
Less water that you use yeah the harder the caine
Fuck bein positive man a nigga tryna live
Now my chain cost more than my fuckin auntie crib
I know what you thinking thats a God damn shame
But a nigga ain't gave me a motha fuckin thing
I stood out in the rain yeah i stood out in the heat
Niggas tryna short stop I'm in the middle of the street
The preacher told me i'm going down the wrong road
But now i ride good up and down the same road
Kept my spot in the hood even got the same stove
And i'm still iced out so i got the same cold
I am killing these niggas
The games in trouble but helps on the way
This for my niggas that move a brick every day ( i am killing these niggas)
Still the realist nigga in it thats all i can say
When on the highway this is what you play ( i am killing these niggas)
