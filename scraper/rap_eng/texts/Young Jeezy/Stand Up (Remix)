[Chorus: Future (Fabolous)]
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), real niggas stand up (Stand up)
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), real niggas stand up (Yeah, yeah)
Heard you caught them bodies, and you kept it silent
Get more money than a nigga graduating college (Turn up)
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), real niggas stand up (Stand up)
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), real niggas stand up (Yeah)
Put your hands in the air (Yeah), if you never fold (Yeah)
Death before dishonor, yeah, we sticking to the code

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah, them people ran up on me
Asking me do I know something
Looked them in they eyes and said
“If I knew something I wouldn't know nothing” (Facts)
Heard a lot about me
You ain't never heard that I told nothing (Facts)
If I'm hungry, I go hunting, I ain't doing no Go Fund-ing
In the afties at four sumthin' (Lit) drink up, smoke sumthin' (Lit)
Big boys, no youngins (No), run it up, no Runyon (No)
Big rings, no Funyuns (No), lamb chops with no onions
And a bad bitch that knows money
She so cold, have your nose running (Ha!)
Lost friends when I found stacks (Yeah)
Lost it all and then bounced back (Yeah)
Only counting on my niggas
Any other time, I count stacks
But money don't make real niggas
Real niggas make money (Make money)
Money come and go, real, you can't take from me

[Chorus: Future (Jadakiss)]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Lips sealed, I can do sign language and order a ki
What I look like being thirsty when water is free?
I ain't bring them people to you, you brought them people to me
Still I never said a word, I just knocked off every bird
All them bundles on the benches
On the front line in the trenches
All them Bentleys, all them Benzes
Shit you was doing was senseless (Senseless)
On the road, we was caking (Caking)
The code, you was breaking
Get exposed when you faking
Let you tell it, I'm just hating (Uh-huh)
Not the case, I do the safe (Yeah)
You rather do the mall first
Lord forbid, they ever pick you up
Who you gon' call first? (Who?)
Yeah, you know how I'm getting down (You know)
Nah, I hold it on the strength, I don't know 'bout sitting down
All my

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
I might pull up in a coupe, make 'em take a photo
One thing about it, I'm the real nigga logo (I am)
Holding down my niggas, keep it real with my amigos (Pull up)
Say I want a Cuban link, that mean I want a kilo (Word)
Trap house jumping (Jump), bitch I'm doing numbers (I am)
Bring it to the door, but we gon' keep that on the under (Shh)
I fell in La Marina, nigga, that was on a Sunday (Flex)
Top drop on the phantom (Flex), pistol by my stomach
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), fuck nigga lay down (Lay down)
Keeping it real gon' pay off, just gotta stay down (True)
But them niggas be impatient, so them niggas started hating
Pussy niggas cross the line (The line), I'll send shots to they faces

[Chorus: Future (Jeezy)]
Real niggas stand up (Stand up), real niggas stand up (Stand up)

Got my gangsta bitch, you ever seen her wild?
Well she getting off like Snoop (Yeah)
With a cute face and that gangsta walk
And them sexy jeans with her big ass (Ay!)
Fly nigga with that gangsta talk
Stay on the scene with my rich ass (Woo)
That drop top, that Rolls nigga
When I copped, nigga, paid straight cash (Straight cash)
All that came from moving weight, nigga

Keep hating, with your snitch ass (Snitch ass)
Stay broke, with your bitch ass
Fuck what you heard I'm self made

G shit, I'd die for (Die for), take the stand, I'd lie for (Lie for)
Told my bitch get life insurance (Why?)
