September 2nd, nigga
We in this bitch, seen it all
Y'all niggas sleepin
Let me talk to them, though

It's a wrap when that Seen It All drop, nigga
16 tracks in a ziploc, nigga
One listen, you can whip a wristwatch, nigga
Said it to my second, streets back on lock, nigga
Can (?) a 100K, you want a co-sign?
Your song featuring me, that's a co-sign
When my new shit drop, it gonna take the world
Nigga, if yo' bitch ain't bad, you should change your girl
I was dreamin' 'bout them ends in the fifth grade
8-ball, lunchbox, nigga gettin' paid
Why you in the booth, when you tell it to the stove
Hardest shit I heard, was Seen It All (?), ho
Ain't that beautiful, you the boy, Ross and Game
Every time my bitch here, she say go insane
(?) cognac, look at how I flip-flop
It's real life, fuckboy, this ain't hip hop
15 told me go hard, (?) lane
Slick P told me show 'em that it ain't a game
(?) with YG about a week ago
He was overseas, he might have been (an ignant?), ho
Bounce right back, cause I'm a hustler, nigga
Fuck your favorite rapper, he a buster, nigga
Me and Wiz selling shit out like it's Woodstock
Ten years, five albums, wish I would stop
Last night, 20,000 hands in the air
Nigga rappin' 'bout them bricks, they don't even care
Graduated with the model, check my resume
For the Lamborghini, Jizzle drove a Chevrolet
17 years old with a pack, nigga
17 years old with a sack, nigga
Hit that Lexus dealer then I cashed out
Then I bought that double R for my trap house

Shout out to my second, nigga
(?)
Slick P, what's happening?
YG, what's happening?

West side

Then I bought that double R for my trap house

Seen it all
