[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Lets start off with the Feds, heard about me through they mans
Heard how I put them white bricks inside the vans
No skateboard shit, I ain’t talking vans
Got a 12 gauge chopper in the barrel of these cans
Forges on that ho, got them in a trance
Got dancing shoes on, she say she like the way it dance
Yeah, get money count bands
Where I'm from motherfuckers see the grams equal grands
Pop that crystal plate, better check my resume
Not the 50 though, couldn’t have a better day
You niggas caught up in the hype, these niggas day dreaming shit
And I was trafficking the white

Work, what you know about it nigga?
Realest nigga in it, ask your ho about me nigga
Glock and a beam real nigga team, I'm just tryna see that life from a dollar and a dream
5 for the Bentley, 10 for the Hummer, and my verse half a quarter ain't look back from her
Hunned bricks later, album and the label, gotta thank the streets cuz they put food on my table
And I stay hot, undercover Tahoe,
Talkin codes to my driver (watch out for them pot holes)
Conspiracy nigga, seriously nigga
You don’t wanna go against they Grand Jury nigga
So when I see you in the club with your jewelery nigga
About them bricks that you sold I ain’t heard you nigga
Road trips yeah I’m trafficking the white
Go with this shit yeah you might get life

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I switch cars with the Mexicans
I just hope this ain’t the car they arrest me in
The highway is on fire
Diesel in the doors, coke in the tires
It’s the price that you pay when you’re a supplier
The lord knows I’m just trying to make it to the buyers
Seat belt on, 2 hands on the wheel
I break it all down, it’s least a couple mill
Get rid of the weight, keep all of the pills
I ain’t gotta be here, I just do it for the thrill
A nigga waitin on me say he want the whole shit
Never spend the profit, put it on the whole flip
Those that like to gossip, they don’t really know shit
What you gross this year, I made in ’06
When I hit the crib, I’ma smoke a whole zip
Cause I made it back safe from another road trip
And I’m gone

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
Road trip, yeah I’m trafficking the white

Road trip, yeah I’m trafficking the white
Please lord don’t let me go to jail tonight
