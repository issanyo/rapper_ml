[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]
When that deal ain't work I said fuck rap
Then I thought about how far I came and said fuck that
It's either this or I'ma pump packs
Front crack and cut no slack
Way ahead of niggas, yo future to me a throwback
I could move a hunnid right nah
Shit, where the load at?
Gotta play ya part
All that leachin I don't condone that
Is he really real or he lame?
Money expose that
Use to have my mama whip my work
Where the stove at
Fiends knockin' at the do'
Granny like control that
Mane on my line with a sale
Like where the O's at?
Bad news I only got 2 left
Had 10 but those other 8 O's just left
Had to stay fresh after shit got right
Had to loosen up some bags man shit got tight
Serving dimes all day and fat nicks at night
I'll be damn if I'm bummy and my kicks ain't nice
All these comparisons embarrasson
Niggas must be lacin' they blunts up with Heroin
Use to bag work at the Sheraton, don't answer the do'
Rather shit fast or slow I just go with flow

[Chorus: Payroll Giovanni]
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I said pocket full of knots
Basement full of blocks
Long live Roc
Top down jamming Pac
Ayy, how long will they mourn me?
This for the, this for the hustling niggas only
Look It ain't no secret I'm addicted to cars
I got a bitch out in the D that look like Nicki Minaj
Got a spot out in the A, shit it came with a lake
Bought my first 7 grams started scraping the plate
I took a 9 up out the brick and re-rock that up
Then them niggas start complainin'
Think I hit it to much
[? 1:46] can't get that back
Drop head Maybach I'ma order it black
Got designer on my feet
B's on my seat
Lil water, lil soda
Watch me mix the concrete
Front some niggas cross town
I make money while I'm sleep
Call my hood the buffet
Nigga errbody eat

[Chorus: Payroll Giovanni]
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream

[Verse 3: Payroll Giovanni]
I'm just livin' wearing linen with diamonds hittin'
On Vilas with exotic women we Tequila sippin'
Use to be stuck on the block with limited vision
Settlin' for less now niggas mad at my progress
They rather see me fightin' a case
Instead of walkin' in the club bout to buy me a case
"Like ya'll out of Dom P?" fuck it then give me Ace
Niggas showin' love with hate written on they face
Feedin' my lady steak at some 5 star spot
Just left the car lot, wait 'til you see the car I just got
Dodgin' cases like the Matrix, It's days I just pray
Like stop lettin' my friends get caught with cocaine
Stickin' and movin' like a boxer
I know it was a crime but they just made a Bentley Truck ya honor
And I gotta' push it through the scene
With stacks bulgin' all through my jeans
A niggas' tryna live a dope man's dream

[Chorus: Payroll Giovanni]
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream
I want the diamond chain, the diamond ring
And all the nice shit the game brings
I want the fastest cars, the baddest broads
I'm tryna live a dope man's dream
