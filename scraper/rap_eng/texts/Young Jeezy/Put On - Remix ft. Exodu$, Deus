[Hook: Young Jeezy]

I put on, I put on, I put on
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city

[Verse: Exodu$]

If you catch me outside, that's a rare sight
Messing with the fam, don't play, they will end your life
Repping p$ycho till I die, Piqua, Ohio is the city I reside
Hometown, Texas. Rolling like a Lexus, life on the road is always reckless
I'm bringing that that new style leaving em' breathless
Yes I've sensed this, feeling a bit relentless, when i wreck this
Like anonymous you better expect us, don't start to complain or make a fuss
When me and Deus on this track, like m&m's we about to go nuts

People said we where never going to make it but we're steadily killing it
Me and deus repping p$ycho and our city's we gotta be feeling it
Like the governments mass destruction on it's own people they be concealing it

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

[Verse: Deus]

You know I try to put on for em
And every now and then I try to take time for em
Everyday I try to find a way to make it better
Get a plan to find myself in Gucci leather
Gotta work hard in the underground to make it up
These days you do a good thing you'll be stuck
But even if you suck you can make it out famous
I don't wanna the muthafuckin lamest
Rapping on a beat with bars that are brainless
Can't be doing that when I'm reppin' the p$ychos
Gotta be a heavyweight in need of some Lipo
What I'm saying is you gotta rap it right tho
Picking yall off like a sniper...rifle
Takin' shots big enough to knock ya lights out
Yea we ain't playin' no games
Issa new year but ain't a damn thing changed
Cause I put on

[Verse: Exodu$]

People said we where never going to make it but we're steadily killing it
Me and deus repping p$ycho and our city's we gotta be feeling it
Like the governments mass destruction on it's own people they be concealing it

[Hook: Young Jeezy]

I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
I put on for my city, on-on for my city
Put on (Eastside) put on (Southside)
Put on (Westside) put on, let's go!

[Verse: Exodu$]

Exo, psycho is the only thing I rep
Deus, might bust, on this track so take a check
When you, want to battle man i'm on deck
All out, about to show you guys how I wreck
Any-day, everyday hustling hard like texas tech
Suave, always fresh on the beat it's in effect
Well being, death brings up your past so you better reflect
You know, i bestow loyalty to my fam so you better respect

Look, all you motherfuckers thinking your coming and bringing it better

But i'll show you how I do it, every time I spit it sounds so fluent
I don't be giving fuck a opinions, If i see it i'mma do it

Trying to lyrically murder me i'm already dead, motherfuckers you already knew it

You had a chance when I felt more alive but you already blew it
Anybody, wanna really wanna catch a body, it's a funeral so u i'ma view it

I can see right in your bullshit like a cat-scan, i'm seeing right threw it
All these other cats, scratching for a name i don't be giving a fuck about the fame

Everybody be thinking it's a game, so i grab a sniper then I aim
Shooting in the distance, hitting the main vein, claiming the kill i have no shame

Trying to group together like a html frame, but i be spitting fire, leaving the house in flames
