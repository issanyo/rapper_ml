[Intro]
Let's get it shawty
Oh this that shit right here nigga
What's up
Yeah, what's up nigga
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, you know when this shit drop in the club nigga
Yo, yo, let's go
Let's go

[Hook]
Why y'all trippin'
I'm just fine
12:45, 'bout that time
Been at it all week, time to unwind
Drink like tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
Rose baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Young Jeezy]
I'm hearin' voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic
I swear they sayin let's get it from another planet
Thirty-six a thousand times, I'm doin somersaults
Do it right and you can leave your whole summer off
I'm out my mind, yeah a nigga's seein' double y'all
Tell me what's the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all
She said long as we could do it with your ice on
If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand Swisha Sweets
In my black and orange Charger, call it trick or treat
It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms

[Hook]

[Drake]
Do I love these hoes ? Mmm, kinda sorta
I got 'em drinkin' Sangria like it's fuckin' water
Some Miami women, tan lines showin'
And they really 'bout whatever, shit is mind-blowin'
Fuck what they talk, do what I say
Bust it open girl and send it my way
You say you like it like that I think I like it too
Half a million in a week, it's only right I do
All seein eye, my eyes seen it all
I talk a lot of shit, I swear I mean it all
Yeah, one-oh-three
And both fingers to the haters try and front on me

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy]
Drop the top, no bra, got the tittes out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doin what I do best, D-boy stuntin'
New car, old money, D-boy stuntin'
Step in cleaner than a new Glock-40
My nickname in the A, strapped up Shawty
You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big
G-Code, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand it's a black thang
You know we drink that Rosï¿½ until we black out
Wake up, drink some Moe' and pass back out

[Hook]

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
What's up nigga
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, nigga 103
Yo, yo, let's go
Let's go
