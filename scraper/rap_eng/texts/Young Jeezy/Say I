I got the urge to scream out
Pull out the bird, it's me now
And I don't know about you
I'm got it popping like I'm suppose to do
Don't want the rich girls scream out
Sweat out the perm pull the weed out
And tell the world this time and that we going to love you and hurry scream out loud
Say III..

[Chorus]
I'm going to make it happen
I'm going to make you wait
If you've go something to prove
If you feel the same way
Say I....I

I'm going to keep it gangster
I'm going to make it hot
If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I.....I

You want to dance then get down
You tryna chill then sit down
Do what you wanna to do
Don't let let nobody tell you what you re suppose to do
You want to go...you grinding
Tryna get me in bed
Tryna do the timing
I know you feel this rough
Hey
And let me see your hands up

I'm going to make it happen
I'm going to make you wait
If you're parent's don't approve
If you feel the same way
Say I....I

Ya heard the lady
Say I if you feel it
Yeah

I'm going to keep it gangster
I'm going to make it hot
([Young Jeezy] Yeah you already know me Snowman)
If you feel like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I.....I

[Young Jeezy]
My nephew getting known and starting to talk
Now my mom's gotta sit and she can't walk
No high school diploma But I know math
Ain't write one song and she still want half
Dad beat dad is what the media say
Best father in the world is what my son's saying
Won't stop til you roll, that's what his mom's going to say
But hey
That's the type of game you play
The media talk so bad about me
The streets doing so bad without me
Can't band the snowman
This is thug motivation is just part of the program
The first day of class and all you gotta do is stay class to pass
Don't mind me I'm just thinking out loud
Pert Got my head in the cloud

Getting to it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try
We can make it if we try, make it if we try (say I)
Ain't nothing to it
Let's just take it
We can make it if we try
Say I

Let's just do it
We can make it
I know we'll make it if we try
Say I....

Whoaaa...

I'm going to make it happen
I'm going to make you wait
If you're parent's don't approve
If you feel the same way
Say I.....I

I'm going to keep it gangster
I'm going to make it hot
If you feeling like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I.....I

Getting to it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try
Ain't nothing to it
Let's just take it
We can make it if we try

I'm going to make it happen
I'm going to make you wait
If you're parent's don't approve
If you feel the same way
Say I.....I

I'm going to keep it gangster
I'm going to make it hot
If you feel like I do, then people throw your hands up
Say I.....I
