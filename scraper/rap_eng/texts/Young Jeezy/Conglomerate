[Introduction]
Most people would consider this illegal

[Hook]
Since we are the best and you'd agree with me right, no need to debate
The way we run shit, see we're kind of like the government
So just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
It's Busta Rhymes and I'm back with the crack and the thugs and the drugs
A nigga's black, oh, the best to do it, we only deal with the facts, bitch
Blazing that I'm so amazing on the tracks, bitch, bounce of them
And I jump and I skip and I hop and I flip over niggers' like gymnastics, hey
Watch the way and I'm giving the streets acid, bastards
Niggers' know I'm the king of the classics, drastic measures
I'm spreading like a rash bitch, class is in session
Uou're about to get your ass kicked, emperor of every round table of the house
And when I speak, niggers' respect me as leader of the councilman
God rap, God persona, God scrilla, God body in the flesh, call me Godzilla
Now you know, you see we be the most prominent, dominant niggers'
Respect my conglomerate

[Hook]
Since we are the best and you'd agree with me right, no need to debate
The way we run shit, see we're kind of like the government
So just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate

[Verse Two: Lil' Wayne]
Young Money's in charge, yes, it´s Lil' Wayne but the moneys enlarged
Priorities, Young Money and God
Now they want to know how I be getting money on Mars
Because I'd be getting paid like out of this world, hip hop is a bitch
And I´m proud of this girl, when the sharks come, see how the fish curl
This is my game, you gon' need a referral, I know more about tree than squirrel
Me no talk much but the heat so verbal, brand New Marc Jacobs
Pink coat's thermal, gun's outside of the gear external, I´m so fly
Ya´ll still at the terminal, I´ll put you in the dirt
Just because I see the worm in you, Dirty South, bitch, admire
And acknowledge it and respect my conglomerate

[Hook]
Since we are the best and you'd agree with me right, no need to debate
The way we run shit, see we're kind of like the government
So just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate

[Verse Three: Young Jeezy]
I tell them, 'Hold up, swoll' up, you ain't see us rollin up'
See them broads froze up, soon door's open up, hey, ladies
You're liking what you see, American gangster, my strap's European
Came wit a scope, got a Navy feel so I can ambush niggas like the Navy Seals
My defensive line lookin like some linebackers, most six cars
The other half's car jackers, ballers' with them things, yeah
We call them contractors and if you're in boys right
Then they might contract you, forty cal's looking sweet
On them honeycomb seats, just like Cassie, my Sean John's freak
Get you what you want, just not that deep, yet, thirteen will split
Got them A Rod seats, two for the Madonna, the A Rod freak
You know I've brought the whole so we're A Rod deep

[Hook]
Since we are the best and you'd agree with me right, no need to debate
The way we run shit, see we're kind of like the government
So just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate

[Verse Four: Jadakiss]
Workers, bosses, Ferrari's, Porches, dope fiends' nauseous, crack spot losses
Race track horses, big meetings at the round table to discuss what the cost is
Money changes you, devils, angels, we're the ones who say what you can
And what you can't do, respect, power, kush, sour, haze, airy, pills, powder
Gangsters', varmints, ice garments, don shit, real niggers' who I get it on with
When I'm around, my colleagues ain't comfortable
They've all got a sick with my verses for a month or two
Wrong nigga to have a problem with, the blade first
Then the bullet gon' follow it, if you're lucky, I might hollow it
D Block, just respect my conglomerate

[Hook]
Since we are the best and you'd agree with me right, no need to debate
The way we run shit, see we're kind of like the government
So just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate, just respect my conglomerate
Just respect my conglomerate
