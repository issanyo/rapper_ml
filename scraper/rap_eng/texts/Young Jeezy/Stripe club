Life is like a strip club
When you spendin all your money then you get love
When you run up out of ones then you throw dougs
When you spend up all your money ain't no love
Yeah

Verse 1:
Spend
Its 20 for the top 10 for the bottom
Like them girls bottoms man they wanna see me drop
Bitch nigga fuck yall ain going no where
You can take it all off bitch i ain't gone stare
Looking so good got that ass read up
Did what i had took them stacks and re up
Why thee whack hoes prayin on my down
Then wonder why i won't answer they call
Broke hoes hate man broke hoes in it
Stay away from fake shit fake shit ain't in me
When young was in the buildin can't say it didn't flow
Better get there early might be later for the show
Now niggas change cuz ain been through in awhile
Like every time i came through ain blow a few 1,000
Give you everythang i got yeah i know you love that
But when its all said and done bitch where the love at

More money more problems that a mutherfuckn fact
And i can do bad by my got damn self

But when its all said and done nigga where the love at

But when the money gone
Im standin all alone

Look now i gotta go,, i gotta go,, i gotta go
We gotta go ,, gooo
