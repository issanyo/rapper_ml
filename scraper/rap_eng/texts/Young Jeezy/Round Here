[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Welcome to the city of the shady motherfuckers
I'm talking College Park, [?], Grady motherfuckers
Home of white boy Marko, Big Worm, and Big Nuk
Neighborhood troop, Kente and Big Boo
I used to roam with Tank, he the professor of finesse
He know why I get down, I slap them choppers on the dresser
Out of town niggas run around like they fake
All of where they from they ain't even got a face
This one's for Double D, they gunned him down in his Maybach
And me and his fine ass sister, we go way back
Heard about Crusty, say he fucked his whole crew up
Plus I heard what's her name, the one that set a war up round here

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I said I'm low key bossed up, moving through my city
Like my fat head nigga said moving through my biddy
Old Nat looking like we're on 3 street in Cali
Where the rich niggas wear the Chuck Taylors, not Valleys
Niggas acting like they hustling, but they really out here boosie
On any given night, you just might see him up in Houston
Living off they old mayne, caught up in the old fame
Always flexing out when you see us, that shit is so lame
Upstate motherfucker, you ain't never been a hustler
A lot of pop ass nigga, you gonna always be a sucker
All bread nigga campaigning they like shit sweets
Getting my bread nigga, home invaded next week round here

Where everybody ain't rich, they damn sure act famous
Ain't trust nobody, nigga everybody business round here
Yeah, round here, round here, round here, round here
