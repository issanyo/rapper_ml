[Intro - DJ Drama]
Jeezy and Drama together? That's a clear win-win..

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a four to a nine, make history
Half to a whole overnight, this is victory
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
100 Bottles in a club one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
They write god damn young, nigga where the album at?
Nigga talking like he fell off, just imagine that!
Know anything about Young? He ain't having that
Flip a 20 milli 20 more he a acrobat
Think I came on this way so ya'll can out a nigga
Took them road trips
Whole things so y'all can doubt it nigga
Who you think count the money up and rubberband clams?
Put it in the Chevy turtle tops like Rubberband Man
3 9 24 - two deuces that's a 36
Show you niggas how to cash out
Bought me 30 bricks
Counting in my man's apartment, in his living room
Paper all on the tv, need some mirror room

[Hook - Young Jeezy]
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a four to a nine, make history
Half to a whole overnight, this is victory
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
100 Bottles in a club one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy]
Trapper of the year, Where the fuck my Trophy at!?
Ever was a real nigga title, guess who's holding that
Popping rose in the club, guess who's told em that?
Standing on the stage making rain, guess who showed 'em that?
And we ain't took nobody to the spot, half million there
Before I ever even seen the mic, was a millionaire
Seems it's a stunna gangland
Diamonds in the chain, if you look a little closer
Diamonds spell his name
With the hundreds with the hundreds
Yeah that's right, straighten up the mail
Got enough shit in my head to send me straight to jail
Welcome to a day in the life, they just talking drugs
Co-sign half these niggas: I'm the fucking thug
