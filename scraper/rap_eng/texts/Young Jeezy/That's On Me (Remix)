[Intro: Yella Beezy]
That's on me, baby
Shun On Da Beat

[Pre-Chorus: Yella Beezy & 2 Chainz]
Yeah, you can snooze if you wanna, but not on me, baby
And nah, I ain't takin' no losses, yeah I got heat, baby
No, I don't know nothin' 'bout dozin', no, I don't sleep, baby
You niggas ain't gassin' me, nigga, yeah I'm on E, baby (2 Chainz)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I hire the strippers, Pitino
Mixin' VLONE with Valentino
I wore a pinky ring just for the vino
I keep it G, like it's ten C-notes
I take the beat just like I'm Deebo
I shoot my shot like a free throw
Opportunity was knockin' at your door
But nigga was blockin' the keyhole
One and a half on a wedding
I bet she never forget it (Never)
I bet you niggas is deadly (Deadly)
Turn your dreadlocks to spaghetti (Fire)
I got my niggas on call (Hello?)
You got some niggas on stall
Pay no attention to y'all
Got too much cushion to fall
Richard Muir, yeah
That's on me baby
That bitch cost one-fifty (How many you got?)
And I bought three baby (Damn)
You know what's goin' on
Stop textin' me baby
I'm the big dog
You need to flee baby

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Yella Beezy my dog, see all this shit I got on
With a splash of expensive cologne
Got her all in the zone
Slurpin' 'til six in the morn'
Switch up a hit and the homie, she want it
Be gone for a while and be on in a moment
Don't run from me, walk right up on the opponent
From rappin' to trappin', I'm truly the king
They still tryna see how I do everything
From movies to business to politics, real estate
Used to take risks with this shit on the interstate
Now I make moves to make sure my kids is straight
Hold up, let me get this straight
A giraffe shouldn't be worried 'bout the ways of a turtle
One eat from the trees and one eat from the dirt
You tough on your song but you timid in person
That shit counterfeit, shouldn't get paid for your verses
Dick be so good, make her go in her purse
That's how I found out people be wearing them purse
Now all I demand is all the dessert
Came in this bitch and I had it my way
Gon' die for respect, let's get that out the way
Lookin' for smoke, you can have it your way
With patience to spare, I don't happen to play
And besides that, nigga Dime Trap on the way, on me

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
Got all designer on me, that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, that's on me, baby, yeah
These niggas be lyin' on me, that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, yeah that's on me, baby, yeah
All these diamonds on me, that's on me, baby, yeah

Keep that iron up on me, yeah that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, that's on me, baby, yeah

Got a new chopper, finna shoot (Grah)
Got a bitch jumpin' through the hoops (Hoop)
Got a money rack, it's to the roof (Rack, rack, rack)

She bad, I can't leave her lonely (Nah)
Why the Rollie lookin' phony? (What?)
Why these niggas tryna clone me? (Clone me)

She bad, might leave a tip (Tip)
Hundreds on me, make a flip (Flip)
Ooh, she slippin' like spring water (Spring water)
You a trick, put a bag on her (Bag on her)
I can't trip, I got cash on me
I was broke, had no racks on me (Rack rack rack rack rack)
Ooh, pull off like the Men in Black (Men in Black)

I was broke, had to keep me a sack
She was callin' so I might call her back

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
My dog fronted me a nine, I ain't never looked back (Never looked back)
Seats in the Mulsanne look like cooked crack (Off-White)
D&G layin' on the G, shoes quarter key (Damn)

Got it from Houston, took Atlanta, straight cross state lines (State lines)
My dog just hit me from the feds, talked to him on FaceTime (Hello?)

[Verse 6: Trapboy Freddy]
Steady tryna stack these commas
Yella Beezy, nah didn't see this comin'
This that blue, know you see these hundreds
Ball all winter, we gon' stack in the summer
All she ever wanted was a Trapboy
I used to want to be Diddy like Bad Boy
Instead I had Glad bags on the dashboard
Hood nigga still tryna get a passport
Young nigga drippin' in water
You better watch where you walkin'
I know you heard them stories
I been the man since Carter
Know you can snooze if you want
And I'll be in your dreams baby
That Glock on me baby
I was sellin' rocks at 13 baby
My niggas on lock, gotta send 'em some cheddar
I send 'em some pictures, I send 'em some letters
I'm stackin' this cheddar, I'm back and I'm better
I'm slicker than leather
Red bottom steppin', I'm fly as a feather
Can get you whatever, any time, whenever
They diggin' this shit, gotta buy a new shovel
I'm higher than the sky, tryna find the weather
You can snooze if you want, you gon' die if you test us

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
Got all designer on me, that's on me, baby, yeah
That's on me, baby, yeah, that's on me, baby, yeah
