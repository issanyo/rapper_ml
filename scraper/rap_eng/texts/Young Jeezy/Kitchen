[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I go hard in the mother fuckin kitchen
Using baby bottles for the lean, wifey say I'm trippin
Plus I got Maybelline smeared right below my zipper
I’m a kama sutra reader and a conjure drinker
Hot on the stove, smoking like reefer
This work ain’t bout shit, that’s why its cheaper
This ho ain’t bout shit, that’s why she cheaper
All we blow is strong, that’s why you weaker!
Wait up, your status change when your weight up
Waiting on the meal, I already put my plate up!
Nigga fall back up, I already put my rake up
Everytime I leave the booth, they put yellow tape up
Hair weave killer, messing up her make-up
Pyrex vision and I’m bout to cook a cake up
Get a fork, add a little water
Get on any track, and I ride it like Marauder

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
It’s Jizzle 3 Watches, yeah that asshole!
One platinum, one white, one rose gold
Drive a solid gold Rolls to the Rose Bowl
Rosé in the club for my rose hoes
Man fuck these niggas I got blow goals
I count money all night, I need some no-doz
Hater, try one of these, you need a bank roll
Throw the money in the trunk, bitch the bank roll
I go hard in the mother fuckin kitchen, nigga
Got me staring at that water like I’m fishing, nigga!
Never know about me, I pull a bass out
Drop a 250 in and pull a half out
Had to do it for the town and the trap niggas
Me and 2 Chainz, its over for you rap niggas
And nothin says butter like Parkay
And nothin make them Jay's stutter like hard yay

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!

[Verse 3: Pusha-T]
Started in the kitchen, king of the whipping
Denzel in glory, tear drop was missing
Just like the roof is, riding in that Chris Brown
Two seater deuces, peeling like I skip town
Pocket full of brick money, neck full of black gold
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like Manute Bol
That’s 2 Chainz, I'm 2 Stoves
For every one I cook, I make two clones
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamera
Two in the Four like the Porsche Panamera
Look in the mirror, look in the mirror
Vision clouded by the coke, ain’t making it clearer
I make it look easy, I rap it up greazy
Bandanna round the brick, I make it look look Jeezy
But I push a ton of it, get the name right
Who else could fly it in and land on the same flight?...

[Hook]
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Half thing, whole thing, nigga I'm pitchin
Hit it with the soda make a nigga start whipping
Hit you with the choppa make a nigga start flipping!
