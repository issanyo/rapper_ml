[Verse 1: Jeezy]
You know me I don’t give a fuck I’ll headbutt that brick (Ocho)
Came to Neiman Marcus now, I’ll tell you what ain't my nigga (polo)
If you steady talking then you know how to live my nigga (popo)
Got a whole thing in a dope bag right now nigga solo
Just left the spot and I swear a nigga reek of narcotics
Cause’ you fucking the stove, yeah you swear a nigga eat narcotics
Foreign whip, foreign bitch yeah got a nigga hooked on phonics
Got the kitchen smoked up like the shit hooked on chronic

[Hook: Jeezy]
I can't even sleep (I got trap shit in my head)
I can't even eat, (I got trap shit in my head)
When I be in the club ( I got trap shit in my head)
Me and shawty be makin’ love (I got trap shit in my head)
When I’m in my whip (I got trap shit in my head)
Stendo that be the clip (I got trap shit in my head)
When I be seeing drugs (I got trap shit in my head)
When I be in the club (I got trap shit in my head)

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Hold up
You thought a nigga really wasn’t gonna talk kilo’s no more?
Hold up
Like a nigga hit the studio and never ever ever sold no blow
Hold up
All I need is 36 hours, nigga like I’m Derek for real
Hold up
If I was Boston George, I'd off Diego for real
I ain't buying no cristal
Tell me what you drinking ho
My niggas spent about ten thou’
Put him in a Lincoln ho
Stove on like a steak on it
Wrapped up with the tape on it
Stack it up, put a vase on it
Only the rat got a face on it
Either that or a boss, nigga scoring or something
Don’t ask me if I did it, nigga, I’m talking like Memphis, what’s up
You got two 125s so you already know what you missing
Residue in the glass pot
Gave my lil’ cousin 200 dollars, tell him do them dishes

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
This one time this one time and I ain't talking bout’ band camp
Told man something wrong with this
Check it dawg, look at the damn stamp
This re-rock, this compress, you paid for it you damn fool
The first thing they teach you on the first day of yayo school
New mechanic, I keep 2, and I don’t panic I keep cool
20 blocks at my nigga house call it brickmade Sunday school
Put together everybody money, that way everybody lasts
Get to talking about a math test, that way everybody pass
