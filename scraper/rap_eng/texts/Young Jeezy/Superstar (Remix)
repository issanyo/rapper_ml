[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
Ah, ah, oh my God
All this for me, I must be on my job
First album was a classic, never got an award
Took my first 10 grand and bought a Honda Accord
And then I pack them thangs inside the Honda Accord
And put them on a highway and watch the Honda Accord
"Excuse me engineer, hope you pressing record"
And on behalf of the streets, I just can't be ignored
I stay in all black just like a new Glock
All the broads screaming like they just seen 2Pac
Say his earrings 'bout as big as his ego
Keep a fresh bald head like he just left chemo
This ain't even mine, this is Lupe's single
And every time I watch The Wire, it's like I just left B-More
Call me Marlo, come be my Snoopy
Superstar, baby, why wouldn't you do me

[Hook 1 - Mathew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
You on your 15th minute of fame and on the 16th
Beginith the lame, and on 17 you lose everything
The 21st is the worst, wishing you was 11
Popping like you was 7 with the feeling when you was seconds
Reminiscing when you was just in
Now you just him, no longer the trend they dressin'
Now you wondering where all the press went
You no longer impress them
Get arrested, paparazzi will press then
I fell on purpose to stay a freshman
I lose, but Lu attend the school for X-Men
So when I get my cap and gown and put the rapping down
I'll only know half my powers, but I spent half an hour
Like a senior citizen, having a baby shower
Haters wanna budget, but my fans still love it
So you can ask them exactly who I are
Nine weeks at number one, I'm a superstar

[Hook 2 - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
OK now, Anyone who know me, they know me to ride
But when the shit was selling slow, it's just my homies and I
Had to get rid of all the phonies and the homies's disguise
So you speaking and I don't reply, homie, don't be surprised
You ain't gotta ride for me, I ain't asked you to
Take a journey on my own, I would gladly do
You go and turn around, now, I call the cab for you
I stand up on my own two, he kissed a ass of who
No way, Jose, we pop Rose, blow dro, that's more than okay
See but don't say, my folks they flip, more yay than Cirque Du Soleil
Keyser SÃ¶ze, oh they, kill people and get off like O.J
You catch your case, just shut your face, don't get caught singing do-re
Mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, ghetto hero, G Code. I obey
He's so gay. Didn't have no business hanging 'round me, no way
It's okay, life lesson learned, I suggest that you go your way
I be straight, no conversation, man, this all I'm gon say

[Hook 3 - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
Wishing it would stop raining, just finished slanging
Rap ain't selling but I'm still maintaining
Tryna to keep changing, same old shows
Rich get richer and the broke get poor
Q did for came back game swoll
Now Jimmy locked up with 9 months to go
A nigga named slow used to get money fast
Lil' David has a Cadillac I wish I had
Young B got killed, now we miss Big Wrath
When homicide came, guess who they grabbed
I remember Rico everywhere we go
He would pay the DJ just to let me flow
Everything we know, we get it from these streets
Can't wait 'til the day Lil Bud released
Now my sister in jail and my brother is too
In case you wanna know what my mother going through

[Hook - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know

[Verse 5: Young Jeezy]
I met this lady she said she my auntie
Never got to meet her cause my daddy didn't want me
The light bill due and the water bill late
Time got her, got a little girl yesterday
Just made [?] and he right back in there
Get him out. What he did? I don't even care
Yeah, he got popped when his kids was around
Took his to Chuck-E-Cheese and got gunned down
Now he on the run, hope he never get caught
Charges he facing was not his fault
The police shot the wife, he got a lawsuit
Hit him in his arm for nothing, what would y'all do?
My niece Tina ran away from the group home
I'm tryna get custody, it's taking 'em too long
So if you didn't see me in the video with 50
Just know I'm in the ghetto, somewhere in my city

[Hook - Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are
A ghetto superstar
Then have no fear
Cause the gangsters here
And I'm gonna blow the dro
You already know
