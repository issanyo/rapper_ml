[Intro: T.I. & Young Jeezy]
Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
Chea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga? I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggas what to do on you, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Goddamn my money's sick, hey, I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it at night

[Hook x2: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dro, my trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm riding through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high, I'm the best thing blowing now

Hook x2

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk, sound like the man knockin'
Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and my mind on mo'
To hear myself think, I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sitting on chromes, that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood, you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music, ba-bounce to the beat
The top down, hop in and ride with a G

Hook x2

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet black
Digi dash, hit the gas tell them niggas check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' light
808 ain't even kicking I bet you could still hear it
Lord forbid I cut it up, I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still hid
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding

[Outro: T.I.]
Now that's a motherfuckin remix nigga
