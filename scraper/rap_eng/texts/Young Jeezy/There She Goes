[Verse 1: Jeezy]
There she go, here she come
Got her legs around her head, and her face in the pillow
And I'm beatin that box like a drum
Gave her the nickname call her M-16
Cause that girl keep bustin' like a gun
She keep saying oh my God, oh my God
Like you must be some type of nun

[Verse 2: Bando Jonez]
She drop it down, she take it low
Her body soft, trained professional
But I write it off, she chasing dollar signs
Way she works the bone, make me feel number one

[Hook: Bando Jonez]
There she go, there she go
Walkin' round like she don't know
That ass follow her, it's so big a nigga want that
How the hell can I get that? Ain't down for lookin' thirsty
Fuck that, just let me throw my cash
There she goes, I'm like damn there she goes, go
I'm like damn, there she go, damn there she go, damn there she go
She make a nigga feel like he's the only one
I'm like damn there she goes, damn there she goes, damn there she goes

[Verse 3: Bando Jonez]
I can keep trying to beat the streetlights
Fast paced, trying to get a (?)
Cause I know you beauty is worth all of my smiles
Cause I swear I see you by my side
Rolling all my blunts, getting high
Let a nigga feel on that left thigh

[Hook: Bando Jonez]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Got her wetter than a typhoon in Thailand
Now the liquor kicking in and I'm straight wildin'
She lookin' at the mirror on the ceiling and the top
Well you already know, shit, I'm straight stylin'
Imma change up the tempo, slow motion
Up and down in the yard, roller coaster
Rolex tattoos, hit it from the back
When she get home, missin' a couple tracks
She want a real nigga, not no square
He ain't the type of nigga gonna pull your hair
Look you dead in your eyes, ask you how you want it
At the same time got his hands all down there
Got to my condo, she a nasty girl
(?) in the (?), she a classy girl
You want a Rolls Royce with an ex trap nigga, shit
You can even go and get ratchet girl

[Hook: Bando Jonez]

[Outro: Bando Jonez]
There she goes, there she goes, she make a nigga feel like the only one
I'm like damn, there she go, damn there she go, damn there she go
Yeah, damn
You're the only one (?) I see
Damn there she goes, go
Damn there she goes
