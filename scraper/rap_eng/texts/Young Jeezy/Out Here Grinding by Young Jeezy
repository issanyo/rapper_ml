We the Best Season has returned
I do this for the streets, the RUNNERS
Cause I'm Out Here Grindin'
Cause I'm out here grindin'
Hey Hey
I don't care what nobody say
I'm a be me (be me)
Stay hood stay rasied in the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
Niggas Talking about greatness whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie
I gotta get me me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slipping 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me cause I am the streets
[Rick Ross:]
Ricky ross
Put my life on the line
But I'm likely to rhyme
I'm on top of the game
Fuck If you like it or not
Ask how I get freesh
Strawberry swishy freshhhh
You'll be dealing with H when you dealing with G's
Flashing deal with the realest
Shopping like it's still december
Diplomat on the fender of the phantom I'm the winner
I do it for the hood

You suckers wish you could ricky ross is in the bank
[Plies:]

I wake up to get my cake up I'm algie brown
What can I say
I'm a product of my environment
Uh oh, I'm in the game
Watch me do me
Ke ke ke ke ke khaled man call that bruce lee
Summer winter spring I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog
A diabetic and all
All I want is my paper
I don't care what they say
They stick their tounge out when they bow their head (Cause We Da Best)
[Trick Daddy:]
You niggas fly
Before you were just maggots
I'm the shit
Because I'm black flagging
Yes sir DR the new sqaud
You niggas soft
We go hard
They like oh god there go t double
He got his click and his brothers
I know it's gon be trouble
Dark boys on the black gas see they don't black mask
Now they can stand my black ass
[Akon:]
I don't care what nobody say
I'm a be me (be me)
Stay hood stay rasied in the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
Niggas Talking about greatness whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin')

Ain't nothing to me cause I am the streets
[Ace Hood:]
Knock knock im knocking on the bank door
Gimme the million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
See you ain't heard I hit a nit
Now my money right
Spend it on the u-haul tipping on the turn pipe
Call up my dogs
Rag on my face
Bodies gon fall
Tell em it's ace
If I catch a charge
Then nigga I'm gon flee the state
Get my niggas LA Reid and Khaled
Watch me beat the case
[Lil Wayne:]

And weezy be the shhh
Like two H's after S
I got these niggas on shhh like I gon deaf
And I'm right right
And your wrong left

I am regularly irregular
Khaled best DJ
Weezy best rapper
If khaled say it's a movie then weezy best actor
[Akon:]
I don't care what nobody say

Stay hood stay rasied on the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')

(Cause I'm out here grindin')
