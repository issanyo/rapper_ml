My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?
My president is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C., anybody feel me?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
My president is black, in fact he's half-white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
If you have racist mind you'll be a'ight
My President is black, but his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'ma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me, baby
Never thought I'd say this shit, baby, I'm good
You can keep your puss, I don't want no more Bush
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the president is black

My president is black, my Maybach too

And I'll be goddamned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Good morning, America, sorry I woke ya
I just had to say what's on my mind, like Oprah
Got the whole world like wide open, his mouth
Same reason during Katrina that he opened his house
Helped raise food, helped raise water so
God knows who can feed their son or their daughter
Say what I wanna say cause I'ma say, say it
Say what I'm gonna say cause I'm a taxpayer
Bill O'Reilly, eat a dick, nice try
You're really being a racist asshole in a nice tie
And tell Dennis Miller his show suck anyway
And I rather watch Jimmy Kimmel any day
I got some white friends and a white Benz
Parked out front and, yeah, also white rims
'Cept my president is black and I'ma be heard
Don't ever try to tell me now I can't say the b word
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my jewels light gray
I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamn if my rims ain't too
My money's light green and my jewels light gray
I'm in a lux t-white, nah I much too paid
(How much did you pay?)
My president is black
My Blackberry is too though by the way
