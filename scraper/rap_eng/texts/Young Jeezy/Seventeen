[Intro]
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen
(Guess the dream is true hah?)

[Young Jeezy]
Uh yea wussup?
It’s the world baby
Uh yea wussup?
It’s the world baby

[Hook]
I was on my grind when I was 17
Only half a thing for a stack worth of 17
Took a road trip, came back, have me 7 nins
When I turn 18, I’m worried by 7 things

Yea, look, take ‘em back when I was 17
17, I had a cutlass it was extra clean
Always thuggin’, always on the scene
It’s the word it’s 2 to bat, need some bigger chings

[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
I gotta get it, I want, I gotta have it
Tie the knots in the bag then I’m right back at it
Yea, 14 grams in my attic
The dealer or the user, who’s really the addict?
For this fast money I'm addicted
She kick me out the house, I got evicted, damn
Guess mama don’t love me no more
Said she might not even let me use her oven no more
125, fresh off the press, smell the aroma
My uncle slick on the couch, he in a coma
And I swear that shits louder than an ambalance
Came back with extra 50, did the hammer dance
My grandma keep telling me I need some help
But I keep tellin’ her that I need some wealth
Cutlass with the alpine, got the two knobs
Blow and the hard, bitch I got me jobs

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs]
At 17 I had a 9 with 17 shots
East 17, 5-17 block
Fitted to the left, whole hood claim Lord
Shout my niggas from valley Bronx to Concord
Nigga, used to play ball
Class, I took the day off
Tryna buy some new J’s, hopin’ I get the skate off
Fully automatic shootouts, call that a spray-off
Before I ever see 17, I bust the K off
And my homie got me blowed in the worst way
7 gram for 17 birthday
In the school hall we was getting cheddar then
Seventeen hundred in my Letterman
When I was 17

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Slick Pulla]
17, we was the clean team
Up in Lenox food court, polo’d up, pullin’ everything
Some lil niggas ‘bout their fra skins
Got my first QP 5 points from the africans
Had ‘em dimes stuffed fat then
Had ‘em stashed in the old spice can, thought I was slick then
Then it went to whole with Nando and Cho
Went from halfbacks to four ways a glass
Then it went to black vans and the task
Now we drinkin’ milk, throwin’ up slabs
Young and wild, chest out for the cash
Just a little nigga tryna come up on some green backs

[Hook]
