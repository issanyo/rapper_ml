[Intro]
Fury
Yeah, yeah, huh, aye! What the fuck I got to worry about now?
Nigga, you think after weatherin' the storm and comin' from the extremes I came from
You think I'mma come all this way to get scared? Hahah!
Nah, nigga, I'mma motherfuckin' win
Nigga, if all this shit go out the window right now, man
I'm all too familiar with this shit
My nigga, I'm straight, you dig? Please believe that shit, man Hey!

[Hook 1]
You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers
Let me fill up my Impala, go and holla at my partners
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 1]
I gotta couple of V's wit' the kits, MPV's on my wrist
A lot of glamour and glitz, but shawty I don't need it
My beginnin' was a humble one, a hustler I'm a son of one
Taught me how to number run, I went from that to number one
Had a hundred ones, I bought a slab, flipped another one
Sold my little three-eighty east, and said I need another gun
The littlest in the trap, and got it poppin' like some bubblegum
Junkies hatin' on my stacks, sayin' I'm nuttin but a young
Buck, niggas say, "What?", then he see me raise up
Just wanna see the little boy wit' nuts change a old nigga whole face up
Cause I spray the nigga's whole face up, wet the nigga from the waist up
They'll try you once, 'til you pull a .40, then tell 'em shawty don't play wit' us
I'm fourteen in the dope game and don't care 'bout catchin' no case, bruh
Don't consider me, not statistically, another nigga it's too late for
Hey, wait, bruh, bet any nigga came from that?
Who lose it all the day, I bet he say he changed from that

[Hook 2]
Hey, you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine, and somewhere I can slang
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down
So I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 2: B.G.]
Okay now, now when I spit it, I spit it how I live it
Every verse I ever gave ya, it was fact, nothin' fiction
I'm a livin' legend.. no stuntin', no reppin'
You can check my track record, I'm highly respected
I'mma gangsta in the game, go ask Lil' Wayne
Ask Judge Johnson, how many times he saw my face
For, "pistol here, pistol there," "violation here, violation there"
Betta ask Rank, I ran the jail when I was there
I held it down, where-ever I go
When I'm in the A wit' the King, or in Detroit in the snow
I'm a pro, whether it's movin' snow or movin' 'dro
That's between me and you, I can get it for the low
But that's nothing, everybody say they got a story
Mine on "Larry King," theirs is on "Maury"
At the end of the day, it seems to won't go away
I guarantee the heart of the streets is straight

[Hook 1]
You can keep the car, the clothes, the money and the hoes
Just gimme a couple of O's, drop me off at the sto'
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the dancers and the boppers, the plexers and the poppers
Let me fill up my Impala, go and holla at my partners
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
Snowman bitch (bitch), I ride two-seaters (vroom!!)
It's a cold world, so I keep two heaters (geyeah!)
I'm straight, you betta ask somebody (body)
Matter fact nigga you can just ask me (me)
A little over aggressive, yeah I just might be
But half the niggas in the hood just like me (damn!)
You wonder why a nigga talk eight balls all day?
You should try standin' around wit' eight balls all day (YEEEAAAHHH!!)
Somebody pray for me, I don't know nothin' else (AYE!)
Why should I help you, when you ain't tryin' to help yourself
I came in this game, fresh out the streets (yeah)
Who you kiddin' nigga, I put my life on these beats (YEAH!)
Fuck bein' broke, this a reality check (check)
While you mad at ya girl, ya betta check reality (AHAH!)
Gotta crawl 'fore you walk, you gotta think before you talk
Damn right they gon' hate (geyeah!) but tell them niggas I'm straight (AHAH!)

[Hook 2]
Hey, you can keep the game and the fame, the haters and the lames
Just gimme some cocaine, and somewhere I can slang
And I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight
Hey, you can keep the clones and the clowns, the throne and the crown
Well-known in the town that I'm holdin' it down
So I'm straight, hey, shawty, I'm straight

[Outro: Pimp C]
Say what it do? Young Pimp C know what I'm talking 'bout?
Yeah, nigga want me to speak on some "king" shit, know what I'm sayin'?
On the cool y'know.. young nigga T.I. jumped out there
Said he was the king of the south
He ruffled a whole lotta niggas' feathers
But niggas didn't really understand what the nigga was talking 'bout
Y'know.. and uh.. so everybody had it twisted but..
Me I understood from the get go
That what the nigga was tryin' to put
In these motherfuckin' stupid ass niggas' faces!!
Was the fact that it's a whole bunch of kings down here
And as long as you takin' care of yo' business and doin' king shit you a king!
What these niggas shoulda been tryin' to do was tryin' to get close to the nigga
And get some understandin' about the type of game
He was tryin' to put in these motherfuckin' niggas' ear holes!
Understand what I'm sayin'?
So I'm layin' back I'm watchin' the game from the sideline
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
And I'm seein' all these ol' pussy ass niggas out here
Talking 'bout they this and they that, but they really ain't doin' nothin!
Cause they motherfuckin' paper ain't right
When I see them in the street, they diamonds fake! Know what I'm talking 'bout?
They shit ain't cut right, ya shit ain't right!
Shit cloudy and chipped up, know what I'm talking 'bout?
And them niggas talking 'bout they "trill niggas"
Don't even know what the motherfuckin' word mean!
Know what I'm talking 'bout? This comin' from the O.G. style trill
Know what I'm talking 'bout? Not these ol' fake ass niggas
Tryin' to come on the scene later on and tryin' to take glory for some shit
Some other niggas paid dues for, know what I'm talking 'bout?
So this is what is.. we bringin' Georgia and Texas together
All you ol' BITCH ASS NIGGAS that ain't down wit' the play
Move on to the side, all you old school rappers like 'Pac say
You niggas flabby, lookin' like Larry Holmes
BACK YO' BITCH ASS UP!! And, and, and, and move around for the South
Cause it's our time to shine, know what I'm talking 'bout?
Now let's do this shit!
