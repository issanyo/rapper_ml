They want it, I got it, damn right I'ma flaunt it
Do anything you want, just don't get up on it
Them O.G.'s raised me, you know them streets made me
Equipped with the gator, drive these young bitches crazy
Baby that's crazy, work match a straight jacket
We stack it all up, and then we Greenbay pack it
Never in ya life seen this many rubber bands
Ye ain't never in ya life seen this many hundred grands
Not even in the bank, you ain't seen this money man
And so I would assume, that you was in the room
Money so dirty gotta sweep it with a broom
Plus you got a nigga trickin' early afternoon

Go hard on my liver, feel sorry for my bladder
I stop when I die, bitch it don't even matter
Dead or alive, bet I'm in ya top five
Even ask ya hoe, bet I'm in ya bitch ride
Everybody be cool, I ain't tryna make a scene
First new Camaro that the city's ever seen
And that bitch clean, and that bitch runnin'
I ain't got a bitch, so I treat her like my woman
I tell her slow down, now baby speed up
Gon' show ya ass, let them haters see us

Red, white and blue stones, yeah them chains like Haiti
Sak pase, I gave my jeweler a buck eighty
My folks get it in like the Coast Guard lay
That's why my crib lookin' like a postcard baby
Tell 'em what you think of me, so far lady
Clip so long it need a chauffeur baby

Go hard on my liver, feel sorry for my bladder
I stop when I die, bitch it don't even matter
Dead or alive, bet I'm in ya top five
Even ask ya hoe, bet I'm in ya bitch ride
Everybody be cool, I ain't tryna make a scene
First new Camaro that the city's ever seen
And that bitch clean, and that bitch runnin'
I ain't got a bitch, so I treat her like my woman
I tell her slow down, now baby speed up
Gon' show ya ass, let them haters see us
Red, white and blue stones, yeah them chains like Haiti
Sak pase, I gave my jeweler a buck eighty
My folks get it in like the Coast Guard lay
