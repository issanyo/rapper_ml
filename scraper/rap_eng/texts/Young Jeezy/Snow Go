[Intro x6]
Snow, Snow Go

[Hook : Jeezy]
First you open up the bricks, see the logo
Cocaine prices up and down, yeah its pogo
Fresh Louis V button down no Polo
That’s a snow go, snow go, Yeah a snow go
First you open up the brick see the logo
Snow go, that’s a snow go
See the flakes in this bitch that’s a snow go

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Ain't nobody trippin’, money already made
And the plug ain't trippin, he already paid
Talking white home jerseys, them Atlanta Hawks
Twenty seven a kilo-gram that Atlanta chalk
Bout to knock em’ all off, this a murder scene
Until there’s nothing in the bag, that bitch is murder clean
My nigga fuck what you heard these niggas barely happen
My nigga fuck what you heard this the birdy captain
Follow Ben Walt to get a few snapbacks
And all they scream is snow, please bring the trap back
Broke an eighteen down into eight teens
Was working with an eighteen when I was eighteen

[Hook: Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Slick Pulla]
Fuck a green light see this a snow go
Got us some walkie-talkies for the po-po
I’m fresh as hell, YSL
I drop it in the pot and watch that girl swell
When I’m dropping on the block they say “that boy hell”
Young hard ass nigga man, that boy shell
See thru top, yeah I’m bail swell
Blowing loud in traffic, nigga fuck jail
I hit him in the chest, he couldn’t exhale
Kinda clumsy with the K, but grip that fin well
And every time I hit that [??], man it fish-tail
A snow go, bring the Glock, we got them big scales

[Hook: Jeezy]
