[Intro]
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Let's get it!

[Verse 1]
I used to hit the kitchen lights, cockroaches everywhere
Hit the kitchen lights: now it's marble floors, everywhere! (haha)
Call the carpenter, the roof on the coupe's gone (chea)
Give a fuck what he sold - I'm the truth, homes (that's riiight)
Kitchen's fumed up, niggas jamming 2pac (chea)
Get my Benihanas on, working 2 pots (dayumm)
Baby need shoes, partner need bail money
Bloodhound for the bread, I just smell money
You niggas just write, I recollect (recollect)
Hands on, Jeezy really counted them checks (yeahhh)
I'm Donald Trump in a white tee and white 1's (chea)
The conversation is money: nigga, you want some? (aye)

[Hook]
Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
Let's get it!

[Verse 2]
I'm what the streets made me, a product of my environment
Took what the streets gave me: product in my environment
Now it's 28 inches on the brand new Hummer
Telling you right now - It's gon' be a cold summer
Blew the brains out the Chevy, call it suicide
It's a way of life, that's how us young niggas ridin'
Trap Or Die gave 'em hope, they waiting for the sequel
It's clear to see: the boy Jeezy do it for the people

[Hook]
Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
Let's get it!

[Verse 3]
I'm the author of the book, yeah a genius wrote it
There's a message in my words, you gotta decode it
I seen it all, every gram, every bird
I spit the truth, every noun, every verb
I never exaggerated one line, one dime
Never lied to the people, not one time
A hard head make a soft ass
And hard white will get ya straight cash

[Hook]
Aye, Aye
Aye, Aye
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Aye
You ain't never seen them pies
I'm talking so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes
I really lived it man
Counted so much paper, it'll hurt ya hands
