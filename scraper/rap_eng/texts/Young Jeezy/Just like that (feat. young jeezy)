[Hook]
Just like that, niggas dont know how to act
Bet when them niggas hear this they get to grabbing their strap
Just tell the DJ, they know
They get to bringing it back
Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set
I said, now just like that, bitches dont know what to do
And when we hit up the club, you know them broads coming through
I told her hit up her girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told yall then what I do
I say now just like that

[Verse 1]
Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling
Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggas Im balling
These niggas holding they nuts
As you see I ain't stalling
Swear these niggas are trees
As you see I ain't falling
They want me trip on my strings
Want me fall on my face
Get a lick for a hundred, damn, it fell in my safe
Sexy, no alcoholic, but she drink like a toilet
Gonna do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet
I know just how she like it
She might think Im a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it
Niggas front like they know me, they must got me mistaken
Bitch, Im pleading not guilty, youll never charge me with faking

[Hook]
You see my back on my Chevy, you can tell Im swagging
And you know that I got it, you can tell I ain't bragging
Them Rollies wear big faces, drink Ciroc by the cases
Im Neo out this bitch, feel like Im stuck in the Matrix
Im talking so much white, you would think I was racist
See I came from the bottom, Im talking under the basement
Threw the roof off this bitch like we just had a tornado
Desert Eagles, they twins, I call em Cain and Abel
Hundred K in my pocket, that shit as thick as a Bible
Superstar in my hood, so that would make me an idol
Had a hell of a night, so Imma say me a prayer
In the lockout Im balling, so that would make me a player

[Hook]
I got em popping and leaning, I got em drinking and smoking
I told her take off her clothes
What she say? That she open
If youre getting to money, my nigga, ball like a dog
Them cigarillos so big, them bitches look like they logs
Im the life of the party, bring the party some life
You know Im dead-ass serious. Why? Cause I said it twice
We talking straight suicide, we taking shots to the head
Must be drinking amnesia, cause I forgot what I said
Stack up so much bread Imma need me a toaster
My partner ride with his chopper, this nigga think he a soldier
Why Imma stand in the section when I can stand on the sofa?
So yall guess what I does, you never say I ain't told ya
