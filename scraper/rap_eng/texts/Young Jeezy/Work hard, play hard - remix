[Young Jeezy]
I say suckas all in my lane
Yo ain't got dough thats some change
Murcielag’ got Georgia plates got no brains insane
Matter of fact, it’s schizo, bad bitch she a thick hoe
Hit the club go sicko, no ? she a sick
Every night it’s champagne, key to life, maintain
Nothing change but the change
What way to keep my change?
Straight cane, young strappin like
Certified can’t stand beside me
I’ll make you rappers look lame
Ugh, bet a hundred racks I’ll bring a hundred straps
Move a hundred packs, 2 presidents, no ice in that
Cost a hundred stacks, ugh
I buy all the clothes, rock all my shows
Rock all the gold, fuck all the hoes, smoke all the dro, can’t ask for more

[Chorus x2]
The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go

[Hook]
Work hard, play hard (x4)
Work (x8)

[Lil Wayne]
I be killing them hoes, lock me up for murder
Make that ass shake, shake it like it’s nervous
Lil tunechi, I’m high as Wiz Khalifa
I swallow that pearl, tongue like I’m having a seizure
And I work hard, go harder
No father, no problem
Semi-crew at your neck, like a t-shirt with no collar
Holler I’m poppin, red bone you perfect
But when her period down man that bitch a brand new person
We are all gifted people, just don’t open the gift too early
She on her knees waiting for that dick like a verdict ahhhh
Work hard, play hard. My dick stay hard
But suck my skateboard!

[Chorus x2]
The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go

Work hard, play hard (x4)

[Wiz Khalifa]
I’ll be working, I’ll be working
I’ll be going to different countries, gettin money
If it’s poppin’ I’m near it, I’ll make an appearance, they want me
If you smoke in my section its bun free
Got my shit, ain't no-one front me
Do a show spend it all on Givenchy
Drive my own shit, now I’m in the front seat
Like oooh, niggas talking what I might do
Talk about the new car, I’m in the Ocean villas like blue
Smoking weed living like a star, work hard than you might too
I play hard cause my bank long, keep ya day job
Uhh, rich ? cool dude, Rockstar like U2
Camo’s on, you too, 100 million views on Youtube
Private plane we Vegas trippin’ with Marley Marl
Vegas strippin’, you going hard and you think of winning
We all can ball if you play position

[Chorus x2]
The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwin’ mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go

Work hard, play hard (x4)
