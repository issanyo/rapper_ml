You got, Young Jeezy
Aka countin' the money in the summer
And we gon' talk about these bouvale cars
These bouvale paint, these bouvale rims
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout

And if you didn't know pimpin'
Bouvale is Haitian for bullshit
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Let's check me out

Top down, still flossin'
I got my Tino on my lap 'cause it's talkin'
Semi-perfect day, got it sprayed at birdhouse
No runs marks, y'all, everythin's perfect

Got the matchin' steerin' wheel
Watch a nigga work, Alpine everythin'
Watch a nigga twirl
Comin' over, soundin' like an earthquake
Got young niggers on your corner doin' triple take

Where y'all from, dawg? Y'all might call, y'all paint candy
But where we from, dawg, see we call this shit candy
This shit is not a game, I don't know what a nigga think
I got that laffy, taffy mix with skittles, jolly rancher paint, hey

On your Lexus, on your Benzo
On your Bimmer, 22's or better
On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers
On your Hummers, 22's or better

On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks
On your Chevy's, 22's or better
On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks
And on your Harleys, 22's or better

Now if your ridin' on that bullshit, put it back up
I got the 24's on the 'lac truck
You see, my Aunty Bridget, she never understood this
See me swervin' through and be like, "Oh my goodness"

It's Young Jeezy, y'all, ain't no body cooler
When I park, all the kids just break out their rulers
Shit I changed the grill, so you know that bitch grilly
Hit one button and watch the screen straight drop out up the cielly

Mister, mister, how could you afford this?
This look like some shit that we saw, consort this
Gather 'round kids, I got a new word for y'all today
If it ain't 22's or better, then it's bouvale, hey

On your Lexus, on your Benzo
On your Bimmer, 22's or better
On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers
On your Hummers, 22's or better

On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks
On your Chevy's, 22's or better
On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks
And on your Harleys, 22's or better

Drunk as shit, [Incomprehensible]
Car can barely park but the bitch moonwalk
Stay strapped, y'all, keep a 9 for the jack
We used to call them Jordan's
Now we call them Michael Jackson's

G,G,G yall, he be 'bout his cheddar
Get over 19 but they be 22 or better
Don't holler at the hoes 'cause the chrome is gonna get 'em
'Cause you chillin' with Michael Jordan, he got Emmet with him

See bounce, swerve, drop the top, all up in your Cutlass
But the only exception is, y'all, these 19 is butt nicks
Rap some shit before me, dawg, you must be crazy
I'm the same young nigga that got a credit line at Baileys

On your Lexus, on your Benzo
On your Bimmer, 22's or better
On your Lac trucks, on your Rovers
On your Hummers, 22's or better

On your Cut, dawgs, on your Skylarks
On your Chevy's, 22's or better
On your Duallies, on your Ram trucks
And on your Harleys, 22's or better
