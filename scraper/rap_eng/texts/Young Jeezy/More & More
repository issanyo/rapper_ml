[Intro: T.I.]
Some shit never change, nigga
Aha, ayy, yeah

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Frank Muller, put one, two to your medulla
Oblongata, there is none hotter
I'm so in love witcha girl, it's just somethin' 'bout her
I'm havin' fun with her, you better come get her
I fuck her face, bust one on her concealer
And make another girl lick it off, I'ma dumb nigga
Since a young nigga, I've been a made man
My bitches come with fat ass and a spray tan
Spend a whole bag, then run up more
I won a 100K shootin' dice, 10 to 4
Playing poker, put the sack up, go all in
Lose, double down, win, go to Dubai
If you wanna win big, the risk gotta be high
Want them bad bitches all on your dick, you gotta be fly
Yeah, he cool but he not a T.I., I will be damned
Watch him do designer drugs by the gram, get what they asked for
Life be action packed but don't nothin' distract from the cash flow
Dope boy fashion, avoid fuck boys, hate 'em with a passion
I'm sucka-duckin' gettin' money, a hard dick all a bitch got comin', yeah

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You know what this is)
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (Wassup)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke (Tip, I got you, nigga)
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You, know what this is)
Hunnid bands

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Dope boy, bitch I ain't got to say it again
It's the king and the don, you gotta play it again
Drop the top, lace your boots up, grab your scale
All you see are triples Es like you're weighin' a whale
See, I'm straight up out the gutter, it ain't hard to tell
Flex, made that yellow butter, it ain't hard to sell
Thirty rounds up on my hip, make it hard to walk (Damn)
Caller from a private number, make it hard to stalk
Drop the top on a 'Rari, nigga, I'm so made
Left the Dawn in the Bend, Dade, I'm so paid
And she came to the mansion, yeah, the bitch got slayed
Skinny dippin' in the pool yeah, lil bitch got saved, huh

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (Aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (More & more)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for
Hunnid bands

[Verse 3: T.I.]
All I know is get this check and the respect
Fly the family from Atlanta to Hawaii and back
Why would you act slow? No, I'm not an asshole
Get your ass blown smooth off for doin' too much
Had it with the other nigga that was tryna move up
It is what is, ain't no way to make a do-up
Better know that we was sellin' crack until we blew up
Was trappin', everybody knew us and then the mill' came
Done been through so much shit that I'm numb to it, don't feel pain
Just heard Urban Legend the other day and it still bang
Get a hustle (Get it)
Make it double, want some weight, you need some bigger muscles (You need it)
Finesse the plan, then work your way throughout the filibuster
Tryin' not to kill a sucka, that's a hard job (Ya dig)
But I'ma still try my hand with a car shark
Boy, I've been gettin' it out the mud since 14, makin' it do what it does
True trap nigga

[Chorus: T.I. & Jeezy]
All I know is more & more (Aha)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for (You know what this is)
Hunnid bands (Yeah)
All I know is more & more (Aha) (More & more)
Goin' to the grave 'fore I'm going broke
Do it all against the odds, baby, lord knows
Puttin' on, homie, that's what I was born for, uh huh
Hunnid bands
All I know is

[Outro: T.I.]
Some more and some more is all I know, man
You know what I mean?
Big-big shit poppin' for a long time, you understand that?
Hey, we do this shit for bread and meat; we don't win then we don't eat, you understand?
Yeah, yeah, talk while we spit is what we do all day, man
I mean, try to be humble as I can be
But truth be told, none of you nigga can't fuck with me, you understand that?
It's the motherfuckin' king, nigga
Come hell or high water, accept no substitution
Stay solid all the way through it
Fuck what a hater got to say
What I did, can nobody undo
Build this shit with my bare hands, man
Bare witness to the greatness
It's upon you
This is the Dime Trap
