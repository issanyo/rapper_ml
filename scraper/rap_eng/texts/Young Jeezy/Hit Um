[Intro]
Uhh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Heart racin', blood racin', no hesitation
One word, determination
All the doubt and all the hate, I need it all
Why's that? It's motivation
Makin' history, makin' plays
Damn right, same time breakin' records
I was born a winner, you feel me dinner?
Rise and grind, yeah you know a successful breakfast
Got one goal, be the best, beat the rest
Extraordinary, legendary
I see champions, they win championships
Only champions gonna relate to this
No excuses, no regrets
Exercise, strategize, visualize
Now every time on TV
It's MVP when you see me
Under Armour from my waist up
Under Armour from my waist down
Stand tall when it gets soft
Where I'm from, ain't no layin' down
Make 'em remember my last name
Then they remember my first name
When they asked me what my secret is
Treat every game like my first game, look

[Hook]
All I know is win, boy I hit them folks
Then I score again, boy I hit them folks
Goin' hard with my team, damn we hit them folks
Then you know our grind mean, boy we hit them folks
Against all odds boy we hit them folks
In our mind, we superstar, boy we hit them folks
Grind hard till it hurt then we hit them folks
And when it time to go to work, why we hit them folks

[Verse 2]
All I do is win, all I do is win
See it's a state of mind, something we can't pretend
And that adrenaline is running deep through my vains
And when it's said and done they gon' remember my name
It's all in your mind, all in your mind
Ain't takin' no for an answer and that's the bottom line
Got everything to gain and nothing to lose
And if you in my way I suggest that you move
They ain't gonna give it to you boy, you gotta work
And if you ever get it boy, you gotta own it
They call me squad leader, I be leadin' my squad
Or call me odd beater, I be beatin' the odds

[Hook]
All I know is win, boy I hit them folks
Then I score again, boy I hit them folks
Goin' hard with my team, damn we hit them folks
Then you know our grind mean, boy we hit them folks
Against all odds boy we hit them folks
In our mind, we superstar, boy we hit them folks
Grind hard till it hurt then we hit them folks
And when it time to go to work, why we hit them folks
