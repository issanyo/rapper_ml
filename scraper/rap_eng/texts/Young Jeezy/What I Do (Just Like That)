Just like that niggas don't know how to act
Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap
Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back
Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set

I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do
And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through
I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do
I say now just like that

Bitches they screaming, I can hear bitches calling
Give a fuck if they like it, tell them niggas I'm balling
These niggas holding they nuts as you see I ain't stalling
Swear these niggas are trees as you see I ain't falling

They want me to trip on my strings, want me to fall on my face
Get a lick for a hundred, damn, it fell in my safe
Sexy, no alcoholic but she drink like a toilet
Gonna do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet

I know just how she like it, she might think I'm a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it
Niggas front like they know me, they must got me mistaken
Bitch, I'm pleading not guilty, you'll never charge me with faking

Just like that niggas don't know how to act
Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap
Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back
Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set

I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do
And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through
I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do
I say now just like that

You see my back on my Chevy, you can tell I'm swagging
And you know that I got it, you can tell I ain't bragging
Them Rollies wear big faces, drink Ciroc by the cases
I'm Neo out this bitch, feel like I'm stuck in the Matrix

I'm talking so much white, you would think I was racist
See I came from the bottom, I'm talking under the basement
Threw the roof off this bitch like we just had a tornado
Desert Eagles, they twins, I call 'em Cain and Abel

100K in my pocket, that shit as thick as a Bible
Superstar in my hood so that would make me an idol
Had a hell of a night so I'ma say me a prayer
In the lockout I'm balling so that would make me a player

Just like that, niggas don't know how to act
Bet when them niggas hear this, they get to grabbing their strap
Just tell the DJ they know, they get to bringing it back
Them niggas hit up the club, they get to bringing the set

I said, now just like that, bitches don't know what to do
And when we hit up the club you know them broads coming through
I told her, hit up a girl, tell them that they can come too
And now that bitch off the chain, I told y'all then what I do
I say now just like that

I got 'em popping and leaning, I got 'em drinking and smoking
I told her take off her clothes, what she say? That she open
If you're getting to money, my nigga, ball like a dog
Them cigarillos so big, them bitches look like they logs

I'm the life of the party, bring the party some life
You know I'm dead-ass serious, why? 'Cause I said it twice
We talking straight suicide, we taking shots to the head
Must be drinking amnesia 'cause I forgot what I said

Stack up so much bread, I'ma need me a toaster
My partner ride with his chopper, this nigga think he a soldier
Why am I stand in the section when I can stand on the sofa?
So y'all guess what I does, you never say I ain't told ya
