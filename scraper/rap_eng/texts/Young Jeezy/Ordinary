[Intro: Trey Songz]
That sound crazy, woah
Trigga

[Hook: Trey Songz]
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? I do
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor, we don't
Niggas spendin' ordinary money, woah
We don't never fuck with basic bitches, that sound crazy

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Your bitch got on ordinary heels, boy, what you doin'?
Can't tell you how ordinary feels
I pull up on any girl and she with it, she with it
I'ma hook her up with other bitches

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I don't take em' to the crib, I take em' to hotel suites
Never know which room it is, I got about four damn keys
I'm used to that, she ain't used this, that's goofy shit, just order that
He ain't nothin' like me, girl, would you like to leave?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
He ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
Whoa, ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
Whoa, ordinary, ordinary
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? I do
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor, we don't
Niggas spendin' ordinary money, woah
We don't never fuck with basic bitches, that sound crazy

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Bitch, your shoe game and your bag game that ain't it
That ordinary and this fly shit you already know it don't mix
Said why you got two circles on your belt buckle, I said bitch
This Ferragamo, your swag broke, and this some shit you can't fix
What's on my feet? Say it with me baby, Balenciaga
Yeah, your nigga on that basic shit, Red Lobster
Yeah, he scooped ya up and he took ya out, nigga had you sittin' on cloth
Came through, Rolls Royce when I pick you up, had you chillin' the back lookin' boss
You know I really got my money on my mind
So I'm really like fuck that bitch
Franck Mueller probably wonder what it cost
But man I'm like fuck that shit
Ten chains on that boosie shit
What you staring at that groupie shit
I'm used to this, she ain't used to that
She in Disney Land with that Goofy shit, wassup

[Pre-Hook: Trey Songz]
I don't take em' to the crib, I take em' to hotel suites
Never know which room it is, I got about four damn keys
I'm used to that, she ain't used this, that's goofy shit, just order that
He ain't nothin' like me, girl, would you like to leave?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
He ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
Whoa, ordinary
Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary
Whoa, ordinary, ordinary
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? I do
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor, we don't
Niggas spendin' ordinary money, woah
We don't never fuck with basic bitches, that sound crazy
Don't you hate an ordinary nigga? I do
Drinkin' on ordinary liquor, we don't
Niggas spendin' ordinary money, woah
We don't never fuck with basic bitches, that sound crazy

[Outro: Trey Songz]
That sound crazy
