Whole thang, look at my wrist, whole thang
My whole hood in the club, I brought my whole gang
I got this rollie on my wrist, fuck my automat
I’m in my phantom tonight, fuck my other cars
… tripping anyway, my other broad
I’m on a mission anyway, fuck my other broad
We got it all smoked up, like it’s a smoke reception
We passing blunts rounds, like we giving smoking lesson
Look at my wrist, whole thang
This nigga snow, mr t got on 4 chains
Damn girl where you going since you finally …
If you back it on up I might blow the night
Yeah I said blow the night
Brick fare, hugh blow, call it blowing time

Won’t stop until them bitches free my nigga…
Look at my wrist, whole thang

Get them rose bottle,s whole thang, whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
You see the charm, whole thang, spend like 30 thousand, whole thang, whole thang
Whole thang, whole thang, when I count the brick, cocain

Look at my wrist, whole thang
Get them rose bottle,s whole thang, whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
You see the charm, whole thang, spend like 30 thousand, whole thang, whole thang
Racks in my pocket, racks in my duffle
Twin in the building, the niggas in trouble
My cup is double, taste like double bubble
Swear I never loved her, all I did was fuck her
Louie V covers, I am so cold
… want you a split, cause all I sell is hoes, all I sell is hoes
… you gotta do the thing, yeah you gotta do the thing…

Look at my wrist, whole thang
Get them rose bottle,s whole thang, whole thang, whole thang, whole thang
You see the charm, whole thang, spend like 30 thousand, whole thang, whole thang
