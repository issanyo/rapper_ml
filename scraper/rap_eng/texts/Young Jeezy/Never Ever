[Spoken Intro]

[Breakdown: Polow Da Don]
Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here
If ya know he love ya
Let, let, let, let me see you 2 steps
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya

[Hook : Ciara]
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
Oh oh
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you

[Verse 1: Ciara]
I know you think that I just be trippin' on ya
Boy you see, this ain't how I normally be
But I can't help this jealousy
Ooh it's taking over me, ooh I'm falling way to deep
Without you by my side I feel like I can't eat or sleep

[Bridge: Ciara]
But I got to come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I gotta let you go, but baby I dont wanna
And I I gotta see, that you and me
Ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

[Hook: Ciara]
If that boy don't love you by now
(If that boy don't love you by now)
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
Oh oh
If that boy don't love you by now
(If that boy don't love you by now)
He will never ever, never ever love you
(He will never ever love you)
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will

[Verse 2: Ciara]
Baby, I can't help but fantasize
Wondering what it might be like
You and I sound so right
But I'mma let it go tonight, it ain't nothin'
Coverin' my eyes
Ain't gonna see it more than twice
I get it, I got it
Baby, baby

[Bridge: Ciara]
But I got to come down to earth, I don't wanna
But I gotta let you go, but baby I dont wanna
And I I gotta see, that you and me
Ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

[Hook: Ciara]
If that boy don't love you by now
(If that boy don't love you by now)
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
Oh oh
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
(He will never ever love you)
He will never ever, never ever love you

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Alright, alright, alright, okay...
I see ya point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day
This paper's what I'm tryna get
Now normally when I'm paper chasing
I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady
Just turn on ya television
And there go Young
I said there go Young
You trynna get it did
Just know I gets it done
She love the way I cheat
She love the way I move, I sh, I show it to her
Shows about 100, goon
Its blacks this, black that
Black car, black flags
I really hope that's money that ya'll got off in them black bags
808's & hearbreak, states who puts interstates
Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy
