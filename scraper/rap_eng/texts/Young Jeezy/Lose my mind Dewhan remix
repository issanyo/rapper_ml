Yeah here my freestyle to this beat
I had to do this

[Hook] Why y'all trippin, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drank like tank, blew my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
Rosetti baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lose my mind

[verse dewhan1] I done seen it all
There no fucking difference
Fake friends 2 friends
They all around you man
It won't be too long
2 they start to diss
But when you die
That when they start to miss you
Talk shit
Eye pink and blue
Lockdown on you
Hello baby girl
How you doing!
My eyes turning red
Smokeing kush ummm
Lose my mind
When the beat drop
Purp purp got a nigga crazy
Got 2 make it home
2 see my baby

[Hook]  Why y'all trippin, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drank like tank, blew my mind
This shit crazy, way too packed
Rosetti baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lose my mind


[HOOK dewhan2]
Am i done
Ummm bitch not a all
I just started on this beat
So fuck all of yall
You didn't want 2 co'sign me
So suck my balls
Almost die..didn't come see me at all
Not a smile or a fucking card
My nigga cj sell that white
He got alot of ones
717 bitch
That where i was born
Crown is gold
Alot of weight hanging on my soul
Lie what i did
Never lose but i won
Don't worrie till im gone
That won't be 2 long
Cuse im done
