Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history
Half to a whole over night this is victory

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
A hundred ballers in a club one time, that ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

They like god damn young, nigga where that album at?
Niggas talking like he fell off, just imagine that
Know anything about young he, ain't havin' that
Flip a 20 to 'nother 20 more he a acrobat
Think I came all this way so ya'll can out a nigga
Took them road trips, whole thangs so y'all can doubt a nigga
Who you think count the money up, the rubber band clan
Put it in the chevy turtle tops and rubberband van
3 9's, one 4, two deuces that's a 36
Show you niggas how to cash out, bought me 30 bricks
Counting in my man's apartment, in his living room
Paper all on the tv, need some living room

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history
Half to a whole over night this is victory

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Hundred ballers in a club one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory

Still trapper of the year, where the fuck my trophy at?
Ever was a real nigga title guess who holdin' that
Poppin' rose in the club, guess who toting that
Standing on the stage making rain, guess who showin' that
And they know we took nobody to the spot, half of milli there
Before I ever even seen the mike, was a millionaire
Seen Jizzle stuntin on Gangland, Diamonds in the chain
If you look a little closer, Diamonds spell his name
Put the hundreds with the hundreds, yeah that's right straighten up the mail
Got enough shit in my head to send me straight to jail
Welcome to a day in the life, they just talking drugs
Co-sign half these niggas, I'm the fucking plug

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Turn the deuce to a 4 to a 9, made history
Half to a whole over night this is victory

Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Win win, win win, win win, win win, win
Hundred ballers in a club one time, ain't shit to me
So tonight everything's on me, this is victory
