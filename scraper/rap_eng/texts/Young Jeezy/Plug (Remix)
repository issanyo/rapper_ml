[Verse 1 - Young Jeezy]
[?]
Stack a hundred bills thick as the Quran
Stack a hundred bills thicker than Lai
Me and my money belong together like Nick and Mariah
Kept the whole team focused talkin' [?]
And to that lady singa' I'm talkin' [?]
Had the spot so hot we need shade nigga
My rollie too bright told [?], "Come bring me my shades nigga"
Took a 36 broke it down to 36
I get a band a zip, guess what? I've got me 36
Talkin' stovetop or the microwave nigga
Get to playin' with that water I'm catchin' waves nigga
Got a million in the room, we all millionaires
I'm paranoid with that check I think the ceilin' stares
I get you what you want cuz' I got a plug nigga
A 36 for 24 I call it love nigga

[Hook]
Nigga on that work I got a plug nigga
Nigga on these cars I got a plug nigga
Nigga on them jewels I got a plug nigga
Man, these bitches love a thug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
My neighbors they thinkin' I'm a drug dealer

{Verse 2 - Boston George]
Boston George nigga I gotta plug still
My block a crack it down we in the hood still
Northside niggas boy we still real
Same shit you fuck with me you gettin' yo ass killed
Nigga I'm watchin' B.E.T like these niggas rappin'
Fuck it back to Border Wars I rather see what's happenin'
She saw that thang pokin' out she like "That nigga packin"
30 round extendo I know I look attractive
Put some motors on the spot check the motor mount
Heard the nigga just got popped check the motor mouth
They told me Boston chill you 'bout to get a deal
(What you tell em?) Boy, my plug gave me deals for years

[Hook]
Nigga on that work I got a plug nigga
Nigga on these cars I got a plug nigga
Nigga on them jewels I got a plug nigga
Man, these bitches love a thug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
My neighbors they thinkin' I'm a drug dealer

[Verse 3 - Boo Rossini]
Like Bub I got a plug that's 1000 watts
1000 grams of that shit that look like sheetrock
From a quarter bird now it's peacocks
Told that bitch to bust it open when the beat drop
Pull up in some shit that ride with [?]
For you slow ass niggas that's a black 'Ghini
Pablo's tacos full of cheese
Finesse gang 1000 bales full of leaves
Gotta knock on wood them people never snatch me
Laughin' at you niggas cuz' we trigger happy
Money back and forth guess we playin' tennis
Fishscale in that pot bitch I'm goin' fishing

[Hook]
Nigga on that work I got a plug nigga
Nigga on these cars I got a plug nigga
Nigga on them jewels I got a plug nigga
Man, these bitches love a thug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
I got a mothafuckin' plug nigga
My neighbors they thinkin' I'm a drug dealer
