I bounce in the club so the **** call me Rocky
Posted in the cut, and I'm lookin' for a blockhead
Yup, in my white tee I break a ***** back
And I keep a big bank, oh I think dey like dat

Before I leave the house, I'm slizzard on the Goose
And I'm ****** than a plane, so a ***** really loose
And I can lean wit it and I can rock wit it
And if you got a friend she gotta suck a **** wit it

Ay gon' an' rock wit it, gon' an' lean wit it
Rock so damn hard, you break your spleen wit it
Pull up ya jeans wit it, smoke some ***** wit it
An' da spot ain't crunk ***** if we ain't in it

If you don't wanna do it, then I'll make ya dance
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands
When you see me hit the spot, betta watch dat boy
Chalay from the road wit dem Franchize Boyz!

Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it

Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it

I'm too clean to wanna pop lock from left to right a ***** lean
Vibin' to the beat, check my feet, yeen got deez!
I rock then ben' my knees every time the beat drop
Lean wit it, rock wit me, freeze befo' yo fingers pop

Purple lean, purple ***** ***** in my sock
What the **** you mean yeen seen buddy on the block?
They call me Doctor Doc, I prescribe what a ***** need
Make 'em lean and rock old school people pat cha feet

**** I'm pimpin' in the club ?til the **** start to act up
Cuz they see my chain and a ***** throwin' them stacks up
I keep a full **** and my ****** in my pants
I'm in the middle of the flo' they screamin', ?***** do yo' dance!?

You can roll yo' arms
(Roll yo' arms)
And just put 'em in rotation
(Rotation)
Go side to side
And snap yo' fingers like dem Temptations

Dawg I'm all out of state, doin' a dance they neva seen dat
I ain't Fat Joe but snap yo' fingers then you lean back

Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it
Lean wit it, rock wit it

Lean back like Fat Joe and snap yo' wrist back

Gangstas don't dance, they lean wit it, rock wit it
***** wit me, pop quickly, gangstas gon' rock wit it

Get nasty, flashy, gon' flex wit it

Do it how ya wanna, slow it up, do the Matrix
Play wit it, straight hit it, get all in they face wit it
Dis dance for the *******, the *******, the cutthroats
