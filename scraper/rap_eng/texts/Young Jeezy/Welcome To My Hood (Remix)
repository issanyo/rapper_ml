[Young Jeezy]
One in the hole, cause these niggas'll test ya
Them indictments come round, yeah that shit there'll stress ya
FBI, GBI, either way they ain't playing
Nothin’ stopping this money, guess that’s all that I’m saying
2 milli in cash, that paper look like it standing
Even taller than me, that paper look like it's Cannon
Take them bricks out the bag, them bitches look like they pilin’
Stack them up on the dresser, bitches look like they smilin’
Then it’s back to the soda, right back to the yola
All this white in this kitchen I got this bitch looking polar
Another 300 racks, thats in the safe in the closet
Got the pyrex at hand, going hard at the faucet
