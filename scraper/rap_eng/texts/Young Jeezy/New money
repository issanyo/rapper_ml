Let's get em

Shining like new money, shining like new money
Shine-shining like new money, shining like new money

Let's go

Nigga sexing where I've been
Nigga I've been on my grind
Flipping bricks and doing show
You can tell the way I shine
Out of sight, out of mind
Nigga you got me f*cked up
Say you got a hundred for me
Tell em back the truck up
My bitches say time peace
Crib for the time peace
Reminiscent about them days
Working with a nine peace
Got only nine cars, twenty guns three trucks
Says..to me ask em if I give a f*ck
Them squares they from Mexico, bakes they from Tokyo
Do it for the homie still post it at the emo coast
Grind hard, shine hard buy kush smoke dime
Bob who take what, in this bitch you whatever

Hook:
Shining like new money, shining like new money
Shine-shining like new money, shining like new money
Shining like new money, shining like new money
Shine-shining like new money, shining like new money
Let's go

80-7-32 nigga you know what it do, hold me bitch one front me
So I front the nigga too, damn right I'm rich bitch
Get my rick chains on
Magic city Monday night got my big chain on
I even got my ring on, two magnus three charges
Is all for one stone, couple thousand one G
I put it all for one song
Do it all the one song, yeah that new G's on
Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest some of all
Hater only hate this hate
Keep it moving on your faith
Niggas in my Benz..can't you see I'm benzin bitch
The all I'm getting dirty money
Stack it to your..

Hook:
Shining like new money, shining like new money
Shine-shining like new money, shining like new money
Shining like new money, shining like new money
Shine-shining like new money, shining like new money
Let's go

Me I'm a gangsta fuck until she goes on
Get her to the room and tell her bitch you take the clothes on
Coming out of DG's, I'm coming out my 87
But you know I'm fresh to death
Famous still..all it go chop and pick it up
..stand, country boy by a crib
Round from on the man, blow up from Bogota
Break it down to cell the phone
Thousand birdies on the..cheap them bitches till they came
Top down pissed them out, put em all showing out
In between..stacked up, we ain't tripping on the trump
Shawty knows what we bout, money grow trees nigga
So we never running out
