[Hook]x2
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I’m just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Bands a make her dance, but she like the dick
Call her Copperfield, cause she be doing tricks
And just like that them panties disappear
That ass finer than a phantom from the rear
She bust it wide open, like suicide doors
Them bands lease the pussy but you bet it ain't yours
She put that ass on him make him fuck up every cent
He going in now the nigga throwing bricks
Live at the pussy club fuck a place to stay
Racks up on the stage, fuck a play to lay
Ass like a face, it just look good
Tattoos everywhere, you know that bitch hood
