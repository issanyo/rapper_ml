Young Jeezy has officially left Def Jam but the rapper wasn't a free agent for long. His new deal was announced with three simple words, "It's official now." But when you're Hov, you can make boss moves like that with a few words.

That's right. Young Jeezy is now signed with Jay Z's Roc Nation. Jay Z's official blogsite, LifeAndTimes.com, posted a picture of Jeezy and Hov together, drinking D'usse, with the headline "It's Official Now" and the caption, "CTE x Roc Nation x It's Tha World."

Jeezy recently went on a Twitter rant about his issues with Def Jam. The rapper even threatened to leak his next album via Twitter. Maybe it was just that time for Jeezy for to move on from the label.

Interestingly, Jay Z was the one who initially signed Jeezy to Def Jam back in 2005. Jay was serving as the label's president at the time. While president of Def Jam, Jay Z also signed Rihanna who is now signed to Roc Nation. Jay recently signed West Coast artist DJ Mustard to Roc Nation.

The parameters of the deal between CTE and Roc Nation are unclear at the moment. Rumors have been going around that Jay Z and Jeezy may be joining forces to form a new management company, which will house Jeezy and his artists.

Jeezy's It's Tha World Vol. 2 is expected to be released November 27th.

What do you think about this deal? Will they work well together like they did before?
