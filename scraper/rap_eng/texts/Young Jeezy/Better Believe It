[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, first up
Shouts out to Louisiana niggas, yeah
Yo Boosie, I was thinkin' I lost a lot of homeboys
A whole lot of money, and I'm still here nigga

[Hook]
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (my money don't fold, I'm gettin' this dough)
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (always stay true stick to the G code)
You better believe it
(I'ma stay on the grind, getting mine like a real nigga should)
You better believe it
(I'ma still do me, be the same OG who put it down for the hood)
You better believe it
(I'ma rep my block every city, every town everywhere I go)
You better believe it (that's if you didn't know)
You better believe it

[Verse 1: Lil' Boosie]
Boosie Badazz
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Boosie Boo
King of Louisiana, I been the truth
If you don't know, better ask somebody
I am the show and the afterparty
I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no mo', still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home
Gotta get it on, late night to the early morn'
Fifty grand in my pants like Ivy Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown
Neck kind of freezy, boy believe me
You can playa hate, but take it easy
We done got the streets, me and Jeezy
Learned from the game how to stack the breezy
Got love from the hood so it's all good
We both gon' eat, me and Jeezy
Riding down the highway (zoom zoom)
.4-5 on the side me (boom boom)
Bad chick on side me (ooh ooh)
She rollercoaster ride me (woooo!)
In the projects where ya find me
I got the hood behind me
My records selling out the stores now
My money don't fold now
You best believe it, they feeling me
From Alaska to Tennessee
From the East to the West Coast
I smoke on the best smoke
We pushing Lambos, Phantoms
And Bentley coupes now
People hollerin' out the windown
"Hey Boosie, you got the juice now!

[Hook]
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (my money don't fold, I'm gettin' this dough)
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (always stay true stick to the G code)
You better believe it
(I'ma stay on the grind, getting mine like a real nigga should)
You better believe it
(I'ma still do me, be the same OG who put it down for the hood)
You better believe it
(I'ma rep my block every city, every town everywhere I go)
You better believe it (that's if you didn't know)
You better believe it

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Stacked brick on top of brick
Yeah I laid my foundation 'til I built my house
And it was mixtape after mixtapes
And then the next thing you know, I was runnin' the South
Streets introduced me to the trap
See that wasn't enough, see I wanted the world
And that's about the time my album dropped
And the next thing you know I was runnin' the world
Who ya think ya is bitch, one of the girls?
See ya ass in ya jeans makes me wonder girl
I'm a super nigga, need a cape for me
Real street niggas they relate to me
A big disappointment I would hate to be
In the wrong place at the wrong time
In the wrong line with the wrong man
Right car with the wrong thang
Can't tell me shit, I'm a grown man
Sixteen years old with a old thang
Same clothes for days, same spot for months
Two AKs and a box of blunts
If it's money you want, it's money you get
Ya hang out with the boy then it's money you get
Ya ever believe that I'd ever believe
That I'd ever achieve what I ever achieved

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Stop this bitch, let me tell the world something
From the bottom to the top, shoulda seen that shit
Me and my lil' thug got it from the mud
Every thang I spit I really mean that shit
It's crazy, ain't it? Hard to explain it
I done got famous, all I did was bring it
The Savage Life behind the mic
Now everybody hollerin' 'bout Trill Entertainment
Rest in peace, Pimp C
I scream that shit every time I do shows
You put me on, and I ain't forget
So for my nigga, I gotta fuck two hoes
Whatever y'all mean that I ain't got cream
If ya see me in the hood, don't think I can't leave
When I was nineteen, I really had whole mil'
These other lil' niggas just sellin' ya'll dreams
I ain't through yet, I done done at all
But I got a lot of stuff that I ain't get to do yet
I fucked up, I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gonna make it through that
From Miami, to L.A
Back to Manhattan where the big cake
From Baton Rouge, I done did it
Go ahead, admit it, I'm the shit, hey
And I don't care what a bitch say
I'ma be like this 'til I get gray
And I ain't puttin' no rims on it
When it's $500 ya ride factory
The new album is on the way
When it's the real deal, ya know ya gotta wait
Bad Azz gon' act a dog ass
And y'all already know this

[Hook]
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (my money don't fold, I'm gettin' this dough)
You better believe it, you better believe it
You better believe it (always stay true stick to the G code)
You better believe it
(I'ma stay on the grind, getting mine like a real nigga should)
You better believe it
(I'ma still do me, be the same OG who put it down for the hood)
You better believe it
(I'ma rep my block every city, every town everywhere I go)
You better believe it (that's if you didn't know)
You better believe it
