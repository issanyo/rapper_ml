Bitch I know I'm the shit, that's why I'm driving slow
I'm high as I'm a get, bitch I'm still blowing dro
Look at me what you see, you know I'm getting dough
See me I'm sittin low, on forgiato's hoe, on forgiato's hoe
When you see me I'm sittin low, on forgiato's hoe, on forgiato's hoe, on forgiato's hoe
When you see me I'm getting dough, on forgiato's hoe

Look at them chopping blades, you see them blades chopping
Keep killing them folk boy, and you gon need johnny cochran
Check out my new wrist watch, the one that got johnny watchin
Used to see when I wave, it look like johnny talking
I'm guilty as stuntin hard, think I need Oj lawyer that white broad goes awful hard, we call that there oj order
My whips clean as mama dishes and I had to order those
Pull up with so many bitches, you'll think that I order hoes
They know I'm never slipping, splittin' them splitarellos

I'm fresh from my head to toe
My autos be sitting clean

Drop the top, ridin through the fo'... with the strap in my lap
If a nigga get wrong, he gon' get that
Like a mouse, make him feel it like a bitch slap
Lil niggas 'round here tote big straps
Hit the mall, buy it all, blow big stacks
I ain't trippin' on your broad cause I got hoes
Louie'd up, True'y down, bitch, I got clothes
Stop hatin' on me, that's what the watch fo'
Niggas plottin' on my life, I got the Glock fo'
Hit the bitch all black like ocho... cinco
Real niggas don't kinko
Bullets hit him in his head from the peephole
He gon' take a free shot like a free throw
I'm a try this mayne bitch like a freak hoe

And my diamonds all white like a kilo

When you see me I'm getting dough, on forgiato's hoe

Money folder, highest over, grind on overload
And my ol' lady say, she can never tell what's on my mind all she know, I'm blowed
All she wanna know is how much yo I sold, but a nigga tricked off and blowed it doe
When I need a freak for the week, so I hit South Beach, laid up with some Florida hoes
Got a bitch suckin cock I'm on 'cotin, least a hundred fifty shots but I'm riding
Pull up in the Fountain Blue, see what her mouth can do but when I catch a nut then I'm slidin
Nigga got a stable full of bad muthafuckas, ice-cold cup of that Chad Butler what I say awake, I gotta make it shake and shine hard, grind hard 'til the last clucker
All my niggas done earned stripes, broads be on our balls cause we serve white
Dawg, I make a call to niggas behind the wall, hitt'em up give a fuck about a third strike, bitch
If you lookin' for that fire, fire shit, hit the back phone I got'em doe
Parking lot pimpin' and ridin' slow and I'm on forgiato's ho (yeaah)

Bitch I know I'm the shit, that's why I'm driving slow
