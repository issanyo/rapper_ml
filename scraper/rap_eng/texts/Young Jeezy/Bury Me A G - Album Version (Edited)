Four shots to the chest, my niggas get at me
They don' fucked around and fucked up my new white tee
I'm just livin' my life, why they mad at me
Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming
Should I even bust back, you ain't see me running
I hope heaven got a VIP line
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door
You know I hate waitin' in line
Paramedics on the way, but they wastin' they time
Everybody standin' over a nigga, screamin' shit
Damn, y'all give a nigga a second to think
Which one of you niggas shot me, it was one of you bastards
Bet a nigga can't throw a hundred grand in my casket
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans
A USDA top and a throw away Glock
Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less
When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans
A USDA top and a throw away Glock
Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less
When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh
We expect the worst, but hope for the best
But you know how it is, Amen God bless
I can't leave now niggas owe me money
My nigga on the west side owe me 'bout a dub
And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too
I should'a hugged my son, should'a kissed my mother
Spent some time with her, show her I love her
Every night she was prayin' for me, I was in the streets
Active little nigga, should I stay in some beef
Gucci go through some real shit and he really need me
And what about the streets, shit they need me too
I'm on some got Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans
A USDA top and a throw away Glock
Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less
When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans
A USDA top and a throw away Glock
Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less
When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh

We'll bring you further details as they become available
Back to you
(Oh, it's hard to believe he's the guy)
I was on my way, I was almost gone
I was almost there, I was almost home
It was some Kanye shit tryna touch the sky
Jesus walks, God testify
I'm a legend like John we're ordinary people
You only get one life, there's no sequel
So you can't take nothing for granted
And don't take granted for nothing
So I gotta thank God for waking me up this morning
And giving me this air to breath
Please Lord forgive me for every gram I sold
Every Glock I popped, every rock that I shot
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans
A USDA top and a throw away Glock
Bury me a G, nothin' more nothin' less
When I get where I'm goin', I just gotta be fresh
