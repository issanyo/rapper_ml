[Verse 1]
You see me standin here, like a chandelier
Gangsta of the year, sippin Belvedere
I'm smokin Inglewood, I'm feelin hella good
A nigga wish he could, I wish a nigga would
I'm smokin on the good, I'm grippin on the grain
Louie the thirteen, mixed with Hurricane
And like a crippled mayne you can catch me with that cane
Gon' be a bloody murder if I catch you with my chain
See these hatin ass niggas gettin on my nerves
I'm so disappointed y'all, I'm at a loss for words
I put it on the hood, I'm gettin money till I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin is the muh'fuckin Feds

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm outta here, send you a postcard
And if you outta that, send you some more hard
I need a peace of mind, some relaxation
I'm mindin my bid'ness, so why you niggas hatin?
I keep it too real, so why you niggas fakin?
You try it if you want, cause my niggas waitin
Won't let you stress me out, won't let you worry me
Just cause I'm doin good, won't let you murder me
It's drivin me insane, it's makin me crazy
You know you owe a nigga, so fuck you, pay me
I put it on the hood, get money till I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin is the muh'fuckin Feds
