YEEEAH~! Machine Gun
Yeah! Jeezy

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I don't gang bang, ho (ho) I just gang bang these hoes
And I keep like eight J's rolled (rolled) then I face 'em after my shows
And I got your main thing bro on my dang-a-lang where she swang and hang like an orangutan
But you don't really wanna follow me 'cuz every one of my boys bang-a-rang
Cocaine (yea), cocaine (yea), my skin white like cocaine (yea)
Marked up like them old trains but I keep it hood with this lo mein (wassup)
Propane, propane, spark that shit like propane
On the Eastside is my domain and I kick more shit than Liu Kang
Hold on, shut up, who remembers my come up?
Who remembers my broke ass when I had no food for my stomach?
Who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G?
'Cuz I don't remember them bitches but them hoes remember me
Hold about two phones, I don't call shit (shit), Wild boy 'cuz I start shit (shit)
Rager 'cuz I mosh pit and this "a" stands for "anarchist" (yea)
My heart is Antarctic, burn one and get car sick
Floating like a carpet bitch I'm higher than the starship (let's go)
Tatted up so I can't work, you would think I got paid first
Beat that pussy out the frame, you would think that bitch gave birth
All these sins, you would think that I hate church
Said "Thou shalt not steal", but fuck that, I'll take her

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Chea, it's the world, look
I don’t remember these hoes, I don’t remember these niggas
Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I see is these figures
I got Versace on, that Versace lights
I ain’t seeing these niggas
Chances is, chances are, I raised three outta three of these niggas
Look, all bark, no bite
All rap, no white
But she wants her friends, to get with my friends, so we can be friends, well alright
Machine gun, we got one, machine gun I got one
See me, I’m a real nigga, probably mad at me cause he not one
Straight choppin’ music, no bite
Eighteen dwarf niggas, Snow White
You can bet a nigga, if I said it nigga, ten out of ten, it’s no white
Tell me what’s not to love, why hate?
Want a real answer nigga, and I’ll wait
Treat my ‘rari like I’m in a roller derby
Put the shoes on and I skate
Say you don’t like me, nigga, you know me, nigga?
See a sound of me, that’s hate
Say you wanna rap about it, wanna talk about it, and ain’t live the shit, that’s fake
Say it’s coming back and this locking up sound like to me, that’s flake
Say you don’t rock with me, you don’t fuck with me
Stay the fuck around me, that’s great
Hold up
