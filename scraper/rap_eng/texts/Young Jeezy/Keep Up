(Yamine)
Yo, Yamine. Let's go. Mhm. Yeah Bro

(Bridge: Yamine)
I've been smokin' dat dope
All night long
You can't even keep up
That's why she call my phone

(Hook: Yamine)
Call my phone
Call my phone
Call my phone
You can't even keep up
That's why you call my phone

(Verse 1: Yamine)
Yamine, Taylor Gang
Those Trippy niggas
Are a thang
I don't even speak clearly
That's why I call it a bang
I said I'd beat you up
In broad daylight
Fuck the cops, fuck the night
Can't even keep up to me in a fight
I go on a flight
To Jamaica
That's where I reside
That's why I call it a cake up (ho)

(Bridge: Yamine)
I've been smokin' dat dope
All night long
You can't even keep up
That's why she call my phone

(Hook: Yamine)
Call my phone
Call my phone
Call my phone
You can't even keep up
That's why you call my phone

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
My nephew getting older and he starting to talk
Now my moms got sick and she can't walk
No high school diploma but I know math
Ain't write one song but she still want half
Dead beat dad is what the media would say
Best father in the world, that's what my son would say
Won't stop till you broke, that's what his moms would say
But hey, them are types of games she play
The media talk so bad about me
But the streets'll do so bad without me
Can't ban the snowman
This is Thug Motivation, just part of the program
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH, The first day of class
And all you gotta do is stack cash to pass
Don't mind me, I'm just thinking out loud (Heeeyyy)
Purple {{haze}} got my head in the cloud

(Bridge: Yamine)
I've been smokin' dat dope
All night long
You can't even keep up
That's why she call my phone

(Hook: Yamine)
Call my phone
Call my phone
Call my phone
You can't even keep up
That's why you call my phone
