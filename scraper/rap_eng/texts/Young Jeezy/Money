If you ain't talkin' money
We ain't talkin'
This is DJ Khaled
Lex Luger

I can't even walk
My pockets too heavy
Got that forty on me now
Them choppers too heavy
Told 'em you gotta fall back
I can't sneak you in the club
Said I'm in the car you need me my nigga nothin' but love
Now its blunts everywhere so much smoke I can't see ya
Ain't over here, look I wouldn't wanna be ya
Talking so many bitches we got bitches on bitches
Way she moving that ass I think the bitch got switches
Pull up to this bitch Escalade full of killers
Now only thing realer, Escalade full of scrilla
Louis V to the back, half a rack for the snap back
Wiz Khalifa's on the coupe I'm talking black and yellow flapjacks

When I talk I be talking 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain't talking 'bout money
Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin' bout money
Don't know what went wrong with me, cause I keep talkin' bout money
Talkin' bout money

Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (talkin' 'bout money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)

Luda!
I'm talkin' 'bout money you never seen hoe
The incredible hulk, so much paper I'm turning green hoe
Green giant, I want it, I buy it
Y'all just ballers on a budget fuck
Your money's on a diet
I'm laughing you such a riot
David verse your Goliath
Let my money talk for me
Hear 'em, shh be quiet
Hamilton said "whats happenin'?"
Jackson said "what it do?"
Grant chucked up a deuce
My Benjamin said "fuck you"
Ah
It cost money to fund a war nigga ahh
I'll have you laying right on the floor nigga
And take you higher
I'm a lover not a fighter
But if a rappers gettin' gassed
Than I'm the first one with a lighter

When I talk I be talking 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain't talking 'bout money
Weed, coke, ecstasy, nah we talkin' bout money
Don't know what went wrong with me, cause I keep talkin' bout money
Talkin' bout money

Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (money)
Let the money talk (talkin' 'bout money)
