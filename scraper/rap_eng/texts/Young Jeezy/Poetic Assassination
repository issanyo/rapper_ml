[Intro: Dutch Masta]
Gambit, did you find them 2 cards yet homie? Haaan?

[Verse 1: Dutch Masta]
I'm deuce four I'm on my grind
You seven eleven you nine to five
I'm feeling good I'm feeling fine
Pass the Dutchy pon the left hand side
Yea you better start running because we know you a track star
Revoke your scholarship because you ain't show up to class bruh
Because you in my studio tied to that computer chair
Guess you think you Coolio living that Gangstas Paradise in your head
Send that heat wifi coming through your fucking speakers
You on that Soulja Boy? Man I should have jumped on Ether
Now hold on, shut up, my fans about to throw up
I been doing this about 2 years and you still on the come up?
You been doing this since fourteen acting like you got a gangsta grillz
Yeah you can deliver a flow but you gotta make sure ya lyrics kill
Gotta make that blood spill insulted I did not feel
And if you was so real you wouldn't have to make it clear
Sit back and crack a beer I'm courtside you third tier
That four five is chrome steel, bop bop all in ya grill
Yeah you callin me Dylon because I spit that hot fire
This just in breaking news Gambit just got fired
Seventeen years and you ain't relevant Angelina retire
Double AA you can be replaced just like some bald tires

[Hook: MGK and Young Jeezy]

[Verse 2: Dutch Masta]

Y'all some sweet motherfuckers treat you like some now and laters
Rip you acapella now then we clowning on you haters later
I don't need a fucking beat just take a seat do us a favor
Plethora of hollow points pick and choose your favorite flavor
Intelligence and relevance that's whats gonna get you farther
You celibate not heaven sent you should change your name to father
Gam-bitch you not lyrical my flow sick it needs theraflu
I'm turnt up from head to toe that dope dick just ask your ho
Got her running for that long stroke make her touch all ten toes
You impatient motherfucker you knew this shit was coming
Stick to what you do best motherfucker get to running
