[Intro: Jeezy]
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Remix! Remix!
KB, R&B
Look, JH, YJ
We here, why play?
You know I talk, talk, talk, that shit
Look, one thing about it, you don't want that
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Say I understand the best thing in the world
Try your best to understand this baby girl
I'm a G and I always will be
And I'm a thug it out until the hood's out, kill me
Y'all kill me, I got it like I ain't him
That's like baby brother act it like it ain't slim
Trap girl can't deny that he ain't [slim]
Try to touch these [?] but he ain't [?]
And I love my hood, watch me hit 'em up
And they love what I do, watch me switch it up
Yeah you trippin', what you thinking?
Must be drinking, what you drinking?
CTE's what I'm claiming
I'm so hood. I ain't explaining
I'm so hood. I ain't explaining
Plug my album, I'm just playing
The Recession, I'm just saying
All that singing, what you saying?
I'm just saying, why you playing?
While I'm playing, hope you're praying
You probably miss your blessing, be back stressed
Doing all that column and all that text
You done bump your head, lost your mind
Since you in my spotlight, baby, go and get shined
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Are you a man who loves and cherishes and cares for me?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
Are you a guard in a prison, maximum security?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
Do we stay home all the time 'cause you want me to yourself?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
Or am I locked away out of fear that I'd find someone else?
(Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)

[Chorus]
Well, I don't like living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might find somebody worthy
Oh, I don't like living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right you won't have to worry

[Verse 3]
Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
Or is this just my sentence, am I doing time?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
If this is love, real, real love, then I'm staying, no doubt
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)
But if I'm just love prisoner, then I'm busting out
(Is that you? Is that you? Yeah)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Jennifer Hudson (Jeezy)]
Oh, you oughta be ashamed of yourself
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Loving me, loving me so wrong
Baby, all I do is try
To show you that you're my
One and only guy
No matter who may come along
Open your eyes cause baby I don't lie
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Remix! Remix!
Yeah Yeah Yeah!
Look, JH, YJ)

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I don't like
