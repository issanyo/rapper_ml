(Loso wat up baby snow man lets get it)

Look at me now baby, it's a beautiful thing (yea yea)
We gettin alot of money over here (it's alot of money nigga)
Alot of cars parked outside to you see me nigga
Ladies like me to alot of bitches love me

[Fabolous]
You know me I get my funny style thing on
100 thou bling on money Yao Ming long
I'm doing arenas, 20 thousand long
With a funny smile that ya honey child cling on
I pull up like the diaper brand
In a brown G.T with the cream leather seats but the pipe with stands
I might dig a model or even pipe a singer
I move dude just as smooth as a sniper finger
And I blow money cause I know money
Come thru like a storm and make it snow money
I was on the road gettin 20 for blow money
Now I'm on the road gettin 20 a show money
Same shit different toilet
I'mma four-fifth-aholic a semi-automatic addict
I'll turn a well known face into a John Doe
Do it like the russians when they caught up with Lonzo

[Hook: Fabolous] + (Bleu Da Vinci)

And you know this my word all my life here

You see the shade of the 6 luey day grey
Same color as the jeep and I be gettin that doe
Gotta make bread keep that flip this make the cake spread

Cause the jewels gettin stupin in the light

All of a sudden bitches right we got the streets on lock like like
