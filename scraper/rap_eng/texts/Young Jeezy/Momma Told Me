Don't fall in love with the boys out in the streets yeah yeah yeah yeah
My momma told me don't love 'em trust 'em

[Verse 1]
Ballin ballin yea I'm straight ballin
If I ain't up at the spot then I'm probably at the mall then
24" Asantis got that thang standin tall then
Alpine bumpin can't hear her when she callin
Now she stressin textin sendin all them emails
Braggin to all her friends like girl you know what he sells
How ya riding young never can tell
Light skin top call it blue cantrell
Ain't nothin like postin big boy bail and
If I don't make it probably go to big boy jail
He ain't even like that tell your momma chill
The way my folk kick it we can even pay ya momma bills ha ha
(Yea)

Don't let this rap thang fool ya I live a street live

Responsibility yea the hood gotta eat

Sometimes I let the rolly chill rock the ap
Yea and u can check my resume' don't
Slow me down I done record my whole life away

I think I really let these streets get the best of me
Baby u can have the rest of me

[Hook:]2x
