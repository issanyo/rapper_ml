[Verse 1: K. Michelle]
Heart beats, but I don't feel
I touch, but it ain't real
They say I move too fast
Going man to man
Always holding a new hand
Why can't they understand
Sex is irrelevant
Just a game in my head, I'm playin' and I'm winnin'

[Refrain: K. Michelle]
(Oh) I broke another heart today
(Oh) and I didn't care, I just walked away

[Chorus: K. Michelle] x2
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Throw that [?], I look better on your resum√©
Than you ever, ever, ever look up on mine
[?]
Meanwhile I'm on my mothafuckin' grind
See I stay hydrated, never thirst that
Most of these bitches ain't worth that
I'm a grown ass man lookin' for a [?]
They gon' make me retire my jersey
I don't want you, baby, if you're that easy
None of your niggas ain't Jeezy
Show up to your house with a [?] in the drop
With a Hublot lookin' so freezy
[?] on deck, hips in check
Finer than a mothafucka, can't lie
Say she down for whatever, smoke a [?], get wetter
Yeah the sex be better when we're high
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Right now we're fillin' up in the club
Then she's all up on me, got my hands on her ass
We lookin' like we drunk and in love
I ain't ask her for her number 10 times out of 10
Real nigga, won't even call
I ain't got no type, just love a bad bitch
Long as they can work them jaws

[Refrain] + [Chorus]x2

[Bridge]
Maybe one day I'll settle down
But for now I'll just play around
And I make 'em feel good, that's how I get 'em
Make 'em all feel special and then I forget 'em
So I won't hurt, I keep a lot of them
And I love 'em all

[Chorus]x2
