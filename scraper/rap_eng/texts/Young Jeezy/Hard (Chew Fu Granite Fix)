[Intro: Rihanna]
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The-the-the-the-the-the hottest
The hottest bitch in heels right here

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
