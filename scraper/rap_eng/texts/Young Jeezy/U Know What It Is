(Intro: Shwaty Redd)
Ay bruh, I'ma tell you on some real shit homie
You know what I'm sayin', you can't let this shit get to you dog

You niggas smoke good, but I stay higher
Take 'em back to the white lex bubble
Could of told back then that dem boys was in trouble

Used to get 'em by the hunderds nigga, you can ask Slick
Bet Jeezy pack the dough homie just like Vick

(Chorus: Young Jeezy)

(Verse 2: Young Jeezy)
I gave 'em my heart, they lent me they ears

July 26, ya boy delivered a classic
I walk through the fire, gasoline doors

I dun seen everything nigga, and i dun sold it all
New whips every month, nigga i dun drove it all
Pocket full of bread, nigga bet i blow it all
And then we go to jail, and think about it all

Told her bring her friends, we gon run through 'em all
Lets get it, she know what it is...

(Chorus: Young Jeezy)

(Verse 3: Young Jeezy)

Ask about me in the city

Head above war, we call it 10 doors down
We hustle right here, work 10 doors down
Live life like a lottery, I call it the big game
Investigate it for me, I call it the big change
I sleep when I'm gone, yeah I'm tryna get to it
It's like a Nike campagne the way ya' boy just do it
Aye!, the paper keeps coming
Yeah, it flows like fluid
Get a 50 pack and we run right through it
Make dem boys tuck it in cause I'm all iced out
87-32 yeah, you know what I'm about
HA HA, you know what it is...

(Chorus (fade out): Young Jeezy)
I can't even lie
A day like this
Hey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so fly
Ya eyes don't lie
You fukin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what It is...
