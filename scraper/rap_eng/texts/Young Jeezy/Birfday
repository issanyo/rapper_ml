[Bridge: Jeezy]
Just know I'm buying what the fuck I want
You know I ain't playing, bitch
They ask me what I wanna be for Halloween
I said, "You know that I'm playing rich"

[Hook: Jeezy]
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Every check born in '72, least that what the ‘verts say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Call me when we get this on, least that what the work say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
If I was you be smoking, too, least that what the purp say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Take the cake and blow the candles off, least that what the
Word say

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Can't remember last night ‘cause I was going hard
Reminiscing ‘bout those years ago when I was selling hard
See, my homie hit me up, say she on a shopping spree
30 for the 36, yeah, that's gonna be your fee
See, I'm tryna get these units off and a couple flying saucers
Come through with a Spanish piece, talk, I'm banging sosa
I know he thinking he done lost his mind or daddy lost his mind
What you know about him, know his pack too loud, turn it
Down, shorty ‘bout to get fine
Yeah, you hate niggas don't know my mind, bad bitches all on
My line
Got yellow gold just to help me tell my time, keep the lean
Just to help me shine
Look, think I got some money on the way, what's that, my
Nigga, got my ball, straight hitching
See that new black down head on the showroom floor
Well that motherfucker ‘bout to be missing, birthday


[Hook: Jeezy]
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Every check born in '72, least that what the ‘verts say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Call me when we get this on, least that what the work say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
If I was you be smoking, too, least that what the purp say
Every day my birthday, every, every day my birthday
Take the cake and blow the candles off, least that what the word say

[Verse 2: YG]
Every day my birthday, buy my bitch a purse day
Bang the hood faithfully like every day is turf day
Giuseppes, Giuseppes, Giusepes, Giuseppes, Giuseppes
My shoes cost more than your weed, you broke ass bitch please don't text me
Would've been with a nigga, tryna caught a case with her Home boys won't let me, too many hits on the …
Yeah, I'm fucking with Jeezy now, yeah, I'm fucking on TC
Now
Crib in Atlanta, the label pay for it, yeah, that's how they treat me now
Bust your life up ‘cause I did, I need a rich bitch to
Have my kids
Her biz is my biz and my biz is my biz
Giuseppes, Giuseppes, Giusepes, Giuseppes, Giuseppes
My shoes cost more than your weed, you broke ass bitch
Please don't text me
