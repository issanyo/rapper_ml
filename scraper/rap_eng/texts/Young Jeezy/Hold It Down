"Hold It Down"
(feat. Young Jeezy)

[Hook:]
Say nigga I'm a hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down

[Verse 1: Kirko]
I hold it down up in this bitch
Don't mess around and get your ass climbed in this bitch
And I don't take this shit for granted
This niggas I hear bitchin' man I'm getting
What you take this shit for nothing
I pay the car note, light bill house note
Man these niggas out here frontin
They got a house pick the window
When she on the pole
And niggas say I'm singing
Well singing got me digits
And digits got me bitches
So I'm a keep fucking and singing
These niggas in my city, all up in my business
Stop asking bout a nigga
Get some bitches

[Hook:]
Say nigga I'm a hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Hold me down, hold me down
Yeah you know I rep the town
Same niggas had them blocks
But y'all niggas don' forgot
Bitch my cars very hot
I swear I got every drop
It's Jeezy from the bottom bitch
Meet you bitches at the top
Fly with me, ride with me
What you said get high with me
Sack off in my 'saci jeans
Bitch I brought a pie with me
She said that she love a nigga
I say I'm your other nigga
Yeah I hold you down, with that weak shit for your other nigga
All day, all night she want a nigga like me
Say you want a moly nigga, I say bitch I might be
Late to say I got a pound and bullet so don't make a sound
Million dollar question is you gon' hold me down

[Hook:]
Say nigga I'm a hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down
For my old G's, for the young G's
For them real niggas for the trill niggas
Everywhere that I go I'm gon' hold it down
For the city main, gotta get it main I'm coming down
I'm gripping grain, I'm drippin pain
You know I hold it down
