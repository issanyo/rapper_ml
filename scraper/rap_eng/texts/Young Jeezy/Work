[Intro: DJ Durel]
Yung rich nation
You know we international
We put a whole lot of work in
And it paid off

[Hook: Offset]
I put my bitches to work
I put my pistol to work
I put my goons to work
In the bando I had work
You say you trapping ain't got work
You say you rapping ain't got verses
You say your the man of your turf
But you ain't putting in the work
Work (x8)
You say you been trapping the work
You say you be rapping them verses
You say your the man of your turf
But you ain't putting in the work

[Verse 1: Offset]
Putting in work like a foot soldier
I got the work you can smell the odour
Knock em out the way like a bulldozer
100 band juug turn your life over
Working the 9 to 5 ain't no money
Work in the trap its like hundreds on hundreds
No homo got the dick hanging out the 4 5th on my hip make the fuck nigga flip
I'm a bang with the thang
Offset Sean Kemp
I'm working these hoes
Yeah offset a pimp
Turning my wrist in the pot it is work
Ain't putting in work
You the man on your turf?
Oh your a rapper, boy give me your verse
This shit was the worse
Now your feelings is hurt
Counting money sipping lean make me burp
Putting in work had to snatch up a purse
Distracted by bitches you stare when they flirt
You pussy boy put on a skirt you a nurse
Pussy niggas shouldn't of been on this earth
Eve bit the apple that was a curse
Ski mask in the bushes I lurk
Look at the diamonds in my watch
I was that nigga trapping on the curb
?
Remix a nigga throw a nigga a curve

[Hook: Offset]
I put my bitches to work
I put my pistol to work
I put my goons to work
In the bando I had work
You say you trapping ain't got work
You say you rapping ain't got verses
You say your the man of your turf
But you ain't putting in the work
Work (x8)
You say you been trapping the work
You say you be rapping them verses
You say your the man of your turf
But you ain't putting in the work
Work

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
