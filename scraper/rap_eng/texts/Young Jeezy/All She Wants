[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
I believe that "too good to be true" is normally reality, yeah
So when she said she's not impressed by paper
Of course I did not believe, no
So I bought clothes and jewelry
Showered her with riches so she'd stay with me, mmm
Only for her to tell me what she really wants is my time quality, mmm
She said

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Don't want your money, all I want is you
She said, that bag is pretty, but all I want is you
She said, now don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes
But if I had to choose, all I want is you
(She said all I want is you, whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I'm an entertainer and I meet a lot of women, that is true
And one thing that I've learn is that women lie a lot better than we do
Than we do, they do
I told myself she's just telling me what I wanna hear I assumed
But every time I substitute, time with money, she would sing this tune, this tune

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Don't want your money, all I want is you
She said, that bag is pretty, but all I want is you
She said, now don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes
But if I had to choose, all I want is you

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Loose it all today, she gon' be here tomorrow
And the day after that
Matter fact, get the rubber band (why)
Cause she know I'm gonna bounce back
She like the life, but she foreign
Bout that life, she just know it
Top down in the coupe, bonnie and clyde
Till the wheels fall off, bonnie gonn ride
Kick back, we just chop it up, she said she on her way, ain't no popping up (nah)
Fine as she wanna be, she got a bindess mind
Bad as she wanna be, she got a bindess crime
Like planning for the future, like to think ahead
Got me planning for my future, thanks to her head
Independent like working for her own
Yeah, so I know it can't be that depressed

[Verse 4: Ne-Yo]
Bought you a bag, don't nobody have
Send you on a trip somewhere, though I can't be there with you
Send all that I want babe, let me get you these diamonds brand new shoes
To make up for the fact that I'm not with you
What you say boo, what you say?

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Don't want your money, all I want is you
She said, that bag is pretty, but all I want is you
She said, now don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes
But if I had to choose, all I want is you
She said all I want is you, whoa, whoa, whoa
