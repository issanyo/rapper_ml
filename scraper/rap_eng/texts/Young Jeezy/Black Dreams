Mafia, Mafia, bitch I'm in the Mafia
Holla at your boy yeah I can do a lot for ya
Speakin my language if you talkin about tilapia
Say you want this money nigga so what da hell is stoppin ya

Nothing in ya way, so what the hell is blocking ya
Can't be worried bout them haters, homie got to shake them off of ya

Off'a ya, off'a ya, gotta get them off'a ya

Death before dishonor hey, that should mean a lot to ya
Niggas got to jail and get the singing like the opera
Didn't make the band so dem boys came to chopper ya
Came to helicopter ya, surgeon got to doctor ya
More than enough nigga thats what we can offer ya

Black chucks, black strings, black coups, black themes
Black nights, black dreams, black Glock, red beam

Black chucks, black strings, black coups, black themes
Black nights, black dreams, black Glock, red beam
