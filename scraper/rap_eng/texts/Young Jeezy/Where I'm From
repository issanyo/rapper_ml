I say my DBGC, that's that westside gangsta
You that boy had them whole things on that westside, ain't ya?
Now this is my story, sit back and lend me ya ear
As I tell ya 'bout cold-blooded killa named [?]
Now even though he was young he had them bodies and shit
I used to cook up them 9's that was my hobby and shit
First Buick on switches, yeah, that's got to be Kojak
BBoy kept that vest on, wore that shit like a throwback
Get scrapped low, yeah, he got heads fa sho
Smartest gangsta I know, it's like he been here before
From where the enemy roll up on a nigga like a zig-zag
[?] six times, have that boy in a shit bag

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' with tape in the southside, my boy was a red rag
He ain't hang out much, that boy stack the big bag
He come to my hood so we both met up bout halfway
Too hot in the dark so we just met up in broad day
Servin' chickens at Church's 'cross the street from the Autozone
Like a bag full of paper, like he gave me an auto loan
Used to always tell 'em red and blue make green, nigga
All white Lexus [?] ice cream, nigga
Bitch in the projects named Kim had small titties
Can't forget [?] nigga told on half the city
Want a 3-6 well-done now? I got 'em ready, boy
Cook these in the microwave, learned that there from Ceddy boy
