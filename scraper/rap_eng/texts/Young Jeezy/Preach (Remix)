(Keep it real with your dawgs no matter what)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
My uncle back there
Look at all the work he did
Shawty got a man
Topic of the work we in
Topic of the gossip at the nail shop
(Rich nigga)
A lotta traffic time to get another mailbox
Trap bumpin' could another go to Hell Bob?
Call the case and sold the brick outside the jailhouse
Outside of the jailhouse
Outside of the jailhouse
Gon' be
That's why you suckers, we don't care to live
We in the corner with them killers on me
Hell yeah
Honey nigga but all it took him was one Glock
Gang signs and all you heard was the gun shots
(Bang)
Now you wanna do the duck walk
Candy paint got me lookin' like duck sauce
10 piece, shawty, and I run the game
Double it and work more than 200 things

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what
(Preach)
Same bitch to claim she love you she done set you up
(Preach)
Out here in these streets there ain't no such thing as love
(Preach)
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs
(Preach)
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak
If that nigga don't work, then he a fuckin' leech
(Preach)
I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free
(Preach)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I don't fuck with these niggas cause they shady
These bitches they just wanna have my baby
Born in the 80s, crack baby
Mama she was in the streets, so guess who raised me
(the streets nigga)
You muthafuckin' right
Couldn't get it from my mama, so I got it off the block
Been working my whole life, but I ain't never punched a clock
Nine years old I seen them niggas get shot, damn
Niggas quick to run their mouth when they get jammed
Pussy ass nigga telling on his own fam
(Pussy)
Same nigga that you break your neck for
Be the same nigga that cross you out and wet you up
'Sposed to be chasin' money, but you chasin' bitches
Real bosses don't talk, we just sit back and listen
Stack that paper up, and then make boss moves
She like to argue so I sent that bitch to law school

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what
(Preach)
Same bitch to claim she love you she done set you up
(Preach)
Out here in these streets there ain't no such thing as love
(Preach)
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs
(Preach)
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak
If that nigga don't work, then he a fuckin' leech
(Preach)
I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free
(Preach)

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I don't trust no nigga or ba itch
Stick to the code, stay focused, get rich
I'm 'bout to make this Arm & Hammer with this Holy Water
I'm talkin' four in a bed, guess the yayo had a daughter
From the lock to the shop
I told 'em cut the head off
You know I'm 'bout to ball
'Till the Fed cut your bread off
Let me take a second
And walk around in wood, ho
Yeah that's one for Memphis
Talkin' runnin' woods ho
If you're prayin' for my fall you deserve to see my ballin'
Chain lookin' like it came from Bourbon Street, New Orleans
Keep your frenemies close
Keep that 40. cal closer
They call me Jeezy Montana when I call that white bullshit
'Till that dick nigga fall in love with a pussy
Nigga call me
I got no love for the pussy
Green for the money all my dawg wants in
First to put a hundred thousand
And I'm sure judging

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what
(Preach)
Same bitch to claim she love you she done set you up
(Preach)
Out here in these streets there ain't no such thing as love
(Preach)
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs
(Preach)
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak
If that nigga don't work, then he a fuckin' leech
(Preach)
I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free
(Preach)

(Cross my heart and hope to die nigga
Put my hand on the motherfuckin' Bible nigga
Always keep it 1000 nigga
Like the whole thing
Yeah
No skill, tell the retail
Nigga fuck the P.O. we like fuck jail
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Preach nigga
(Amen)
