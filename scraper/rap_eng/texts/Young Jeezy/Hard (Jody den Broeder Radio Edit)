[Intro: Rihanna]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going 'til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) That Rihanna reign just don't let up
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

[Break 1: Rihanna]
So hard, so hard, so hard
So hard, so hard, so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

[Break 2: Rihanna]
Ride this beat, beat, beat
This beat, beat, beat
Ride this beat, beat, beat
This beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat
Ride this beat, beat, beat
This beat, beat, beat
Ride this beat, beat, beat

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Where them girls talking trash?

Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at?

Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

[Break 3: Jeezy]
So hard, so hard, so hard, too hard
Go hard or go home
So hard, too hard, so hard, too hard
So hard, too hard, so hard

[Chorus: Rihanna]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

[Outro: Rihanna]
That I, I, I
