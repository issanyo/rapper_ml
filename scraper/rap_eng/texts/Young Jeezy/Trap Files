I was chillin n da hood should I say da Trap
Niggas lookin 4 da work n know exactly where im at
Posted up im chillin stackin 2 da ceillin
Tryna figure out da fastest way grind up on a million
In a dope fein jacket she know dat im da man
Gotta income tax check N she spent 3 grand
Keepa str8 shoota da gurl got it bad
Caught her n da backyard breakin down brillo pads
Dont be cursin at my grandma, watch ya mufuckin mouth
See me n da street dont be cumin 2 her house
There go robin ass Carlos I pay him no mind
Last nigga tried 2 get shot his ass 4x
Keep my ears 2 da street heard thru da grapevine
Him and dem niggas steady runnin wit plottin on mine
Get it how a live yea im ready 4 da static
50 round clip n its fully automatic
Fresh outta work so im baggin up mo'
Til' my lil cousin told me dat my p.o. at da doe
Ain't dis boutta bitch
Hid the quarter birdy
Curfews at 9 n its only 7:30
So now im at my aunt's house i need 2 use da kitchen
No matta what I give her she be mufuckin trippin
She ask for 800, I gave her what I got
My shit ain't where I put who been fuckin wit my pot?

She said its over there witcha' bags an ya' scale
Gotta H-Town plate first thing n da moanin'
Headed 2 his front doe b4 da nigga start yawnin'
Im talkin Trap files

(chorus)

I was chillin n da hood should I say da trap
Niggas lookin 4 da work n kno exactly where im at
Posted up chillin stackin 2 da ceillin
Tryna figure out da fastest way grind up on a million
Heard dis nigga buyin' cars man dis mufucka krazi
Always playin phone tag nigga fuck u pay me
Get smash like potatoes 4 thinkin shit gravy
1 phone call il' have his whole body lazy
Plotican wit da hommies, all convicted felons
Been 2 prison 6x n ain't shit dat u can tellem'
And he rite back at it, touchdown n December
Nigga damn near folded still I had the gang member
First a nigga skool dem , then I roll da dice
Went and telll da folks shit I need it n my life
So now im pickin up my money
Tuck my pistol n my pants
Bet  20/20 mo' so I left it like a grand
Dope game bitch u can play if u wanna
Heard da feds snatch lil Tony dem' from round da corner
Heard da nigga got popped wit 2 bricks and a llama
Even picked up his gurl n den they came n got his momma'
Got em on a wire tap, shuda' heard it n his tone
Crash dummy ass nigga talkin reckless on da phone

(chorus)
