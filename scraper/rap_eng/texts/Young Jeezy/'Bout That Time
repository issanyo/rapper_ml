[Refrain]
Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too bad
Rosé, baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there's mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm hearing voices in my head, think I'm schizophrenic
I swear they saying, 'Let's get it from another planet'
Thirty six, a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults
Do it right and you can live your whole summer raw
I'm out my mind, yeah, a nigga seeing double y'all
Now, tell me what's the chance of Jizzle fucking both of y'all
She said, 'As long as we can do it with your ice on'
If that's the case, we might as well leave the lights on
I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets
In my black and orange Charger, call it trick-or-treat
It ain't nothing to a boss, my goons got goons
House stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms

[Refrain]
Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too bad
Rosé, baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there's mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 2: Plies]
Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partners
Guess why she hate them though, cause all of them robbing
Fuck the police, cause all of them problems
White girls fun, cause all of them swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at the house, cause the bitch hollered
And where the pill man at, she need a blue dolphin
Old broke ass nigga, stop cock blocking
Security, I need help cause the bitch stalking
A half fucking mil', that's what the whip cost me
One hundred dollars, that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hating, that's when the nigga lost me
'Fantastico', that's what the hoes, that's what the hoes call me

[Refrain]
Why y'all trip, I'm just fine
Twelve forty five, 'bout that time
Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind
Drink like a tank, lose my mind
This shit crazy, way too bad
Rosé, baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there's mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Drop the top, no bra, got her titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out
Doing what I do best, D boy stunting
New car, old money, D boy stunting
Step in cleaner than a new Glock 40
Nickname in the 'A', strapped up, shorty
You know my nerves bad, trigger's like a toothpick
Line wrapped around the corner, boy, too big
G Code, black shades and my black chains
But if you wouldn't understand, it's a black thing
You know we drink that Rosé 'til we black out
Wake up, drink some more, pass back out
