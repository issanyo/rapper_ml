[Intro: Jeezy]
Long live Bankroll nigga
D. Rich what’s happening?
Quicktrip what it do?
Street Money Worldwide
Snow season nigga
I’m sitting in this all white Mulsanne
White seats, white sweats on
So I don’t fuck up my leather nigga
Niggas better get it together nigga

[Hook: Quicktrip]
New coupe, all white
‘Bout to hog up the lane fill
Young nigga ballin’ hard
Got traffic in the stash still
Won’t stop ‘til I get a milly
Gotta bring the whole fam here
Won’t stop until I get a jet
Got to build me a landing strip
I’m right here now nigga
Came from the projects
Why I talk a lot of shit now
Cause I ain’t never had shit
Get up off your ass nigga
Go ride another nigga’s dick
You wouldn’t be in that position nigga
If you was doing your own shit

[Verse 1: Quicktrip]
Yeah I got my name from the projects
Yeah I got this game from the projects
Ran straight to get the Bentley truck
Y’all can go’n ‘head and get the Masi
Catch me 458 with Que
Or riding 488 with [?]
Soon as I get that Bentley truck nigga
Going straight to pick up my son
Who you want to hang with Jordan?
Said Bankroll, let’s [?]
Street Money CEO dead
Had to help mom raise his son
Tank top on, motor store
Cooking dope in some [?] Juans
Ali fronted me my first brick
Told me hit ‘em up when I was done
On the street doing real numbers
Me, Kevin Whiteboy, and Rocky
Started off selling nicks nigga
Then I learned how to save the projects
Now the money got so big
Had to get a bigger safe deposit
Long live Bankroll nigga
Street Money Worldwide, I got him

[Hook: Quicktrip]
New coupe, all white
‘Bout to hog up the lane fill
Young nigga ballin’ hard
Got traffic in the stash still
Won’t stop ‘til I get a milly
Gotta bring the whole fam here
Won’t stop until I get a jet
Got to build me a landing strip
I’m right here now nigga
Came from the projects
Why I talk a lot of shit now
Cause I ain’t never had shit
Get up off your ass nigga
Go ride another nigga’s dick
You wouldn’t be in that position nigga
If you was doing your own shit

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
New spot all white
Yellow horses in the steering wheel
Give a pussy nigga migraines
Glovebox full of Advil
Hundred thousand, Magic City shoot
On the stage, everybody witness
I don’t throw that talkin’ ass ho
Bitch tellin’ everybody’s business
Told her I look better on her resume then she’ll ever look on mine
BET at the gold room, Cubans on, everybody blind
ATL all out to Houston
Got street money worldwide
Rap niggas all be riding waves
Watch a real nigga change the tide
Back to back Bentleys in my hood
Yeah they call me dark skin Obama
Inside of so many drugs
Yeah bitch I could’ve been a drummer
They say Snow you’re going hard
I say I ain’t going hard enough
Copped that million dollar [?]
Put that bitch right up in the bluff
From the projects, eating fried chicken
Now a nigga eating calamari
So many [?] in the bank, should’ve been on an episode of Maury
Gave my grandma 500 dollars
She put on a broad with the titties
Coupe cost 500 thousand
Hear them pipes all across the city

[Hook: Quicktrip]
New coupe, all white
‘Bout to hog up the lane fill
Young nigga ballin’ hard
Got traffic in the stash still
Won’t stop ‘til I get a milly
Gotta bring the whole fam here
Won’t stop until I get a jet
Got to build me a landing strip
I’m right here now nigga

Why I talk a lot of shit now
Cause I ain’t never had shit

Go ride another nigga’s dick
You wouldn’t be in that position nigga
