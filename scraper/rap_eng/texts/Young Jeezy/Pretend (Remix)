[Intro: Jeezy]
Black Eskimo baby chinchilla black llama
With the arguing and the drama
That's on my mamma
My alter ego a fool so I won't defend them
Guess it is what it is at least I ain't pretending
(you, you)

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ain't nobody perfect
So if you take a while to make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Let's pretend that we 'boutta break up
To catch the feelings that way we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we courtside

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tinashe]
Let's pretend I ain't your friend
So we can get it on again
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
If we pretend that I'm happy when I'm really not
Pretend that I give you everything I've got
Pretend that I'm there when I ain't there
Pretend that I care when I don't care
Once upon a time, I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everything's straight
When everything just ain't just covered up like paint

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
Let's pretend it's my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I was balling at the [?] had an adolescent
See me in the club bunch of bitches in my section
You got a semi with the streets, ya we got a deep connection
Don't miss out on your blessing and be back stressing
Two door mustard Dodge Grey Poupon in this bitch
Wrist frostbit, might need an arm in this bitch
Gangster and a gentleman, the best of both worlds
I'm handsome and I'm wealthy, I can leave with all the girls
Pipe game crazy I could've been a plumber
Self made boss ya I used to be a runner
Hear you talking about commitment I get stiffer than a mannequin
Your girls say I'm a handful, they doubt if you can handle it
Imaginary player, your nigga fake balling
Me, I'm with the shits though your nigga stay stalling
Ain't got time for them bags, them bitches ain't got shit
Hit the club every night to flex their new outfit, pretending

[Chorus: Tinashe]

[Outro: Tinashe]
Can we pretend?
