(Young Jeezy talking)

Verse: One
Niggas on the dance floor losing they mind
The reason why yo baby mama throwing up gang signs
A nigga with an attitude & it's plane to see
The lil niggas in my hood call me Jeezy-E
Cause I'm a mothafuckin fool
When I pack a mack 10 & rock a lot of ice cubes (Daaaamn)
Got the choppers nigga, ain't talking motor bikes (noo)
The rocks in my ear shine like headlights
A hundred rounds about the size of darts
Call it Big Sexy... Tear your man apart (that riiiight)
Real recognize real & dawg I feel ya
But if you put yo hands on me Kinky-B gon kill ya
Chorus
Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya nigga
The niggas in ya hood / We luv ya nigga
Them niggas in the trap / We luv ya nigga
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya nigga

Verse: Two
Calling me a workaholic cause I work too much
& They say I like to talk about the work too much
Lemme see, I'm not a plumber, a nigga can't fix cars (nope)
I'm an astrologist, I know all the stars (heeey)
I'm not a politician, or lawyer, or doctor, a barber, or a teacher, a rapper, or a preacher
And I ain't gon lie... I had a nine to five
My trap opened at nine and closed at five (haha)
T - R - A - P nigga O - R D - I - E nigga (yeeeeah)
You niggas are sore losers ..... I'm a born winner
Fish scale on the stove..... Just cook dinner
Chorus
Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya nigga
The niggas in ya hood / We luv ya nigga
Them niggas in the trap / We luv ya nigga
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya nigga

Verse: Three
It was either be a rapper or sit behind bars
The next best thing... Rock ice, drive cars (yeeeeah)
Plus I was good at it nigga.... You shoulda seen me with them thangs
You was good at it nigga
I gotta way with hoes... Work the microwave I gotta way with O's
Don't get it twisted.... Look I mean well
I'm a hustla, I can sell fire in hell
Get that thang poppin like a 7/11 if I make it up top I'm selling wings in heaven
Please Lord forgive me... For I have sinned
A nigga got his grind on.... i had to have that Benz
Chorus
Them hoes in the projects / We luv ya nigga
The niggas in ya hood / We luv ya nigga
Them niggas in the trap / We luv ya nigga
They fuckin with you like that? / We luv ya nigga
