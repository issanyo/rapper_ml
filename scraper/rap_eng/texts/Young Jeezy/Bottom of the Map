[Spoken Intro]

[Hook]
It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map
Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap
I do it for the trappers with the, the, the rocks
And them O.G. niggas with the, the, the blocks

[Verse 1]
I'm strapped up, I'm iced out
A nigga play, it's lights out
Cost a cool quarter million
That's how you'll find me
Swirving through traffic with them goons behind me
You better call your crew, you gon' need help
Whole car strapped, and I ain't talking seat belts
Red cross nigga, yeah we draw blood
Whole team got choppas like a bike club
I don't get mad, I just get money
And laugh at these fuck niggas, cause they so funny
All a gangsta do is stay fresh
45 with the gucci teflon vest

[Verse 2]
I'm on fire, the kids out of control
Competition want me to stop, drop, and roll
Like I had a flame thrower and some gasoline
Set the city on fire, that's on everything
I walk around like I got a grip in my pants
Yeah that's about 10 stacks, half a brick in my pants
Fishscale got Papi on speed dial
You niggas getting raped, you still gettin' oil base
My flow is bananas, the coupe is grape
Evisu jeans with the Bathin' Apes
Desert on the pillow, choppas by the nightstand
You can roll the dice, play with your life man

[Verse 3]
All that tough talk, you just wastin' your breath
Hit your ass with them things, have you chasing your breath
You got loose lips, you better put a collar on 'em
Black chanel frames, I spent a couple dollars on 'em
Whole zip of kush, just to get my mind right
Grab some roll, see the one, get my sound right
My money come fast, so that's how I spend it
Trunk sounded like it got a marching band in it
You in the minor leagues, and I'm a heavy weight
Flipping brick houses, we call it real estate
Five thousand for the pound, get your curb service
Sell a lot of grass, like I got a lawn service
