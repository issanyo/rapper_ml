[Intro]
I'm out in paradise on this chardonnay but I'm still thinking about the struggle though. Yeah, real shit

[Hook]
I'm from a small hood and we big on respect
You get your money up, you go big on your neck
Hit the dealership and go big on the 'Vette
By any means, gotta get the check
Politically correct
In my Makaveli voice, yeah I'm down for the cause
Judge, does hoop shit, to hell with them laws
The revolution won't be televised on the net
So if you're comin', best be comin' with respect
Politically correct

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the mind of a black man
This world done drove me so crazy think I need me a CAT scan
Pocket full of paper, no credit
Think I ain't 'bout to flex up on these folks then forget it
See poverty, yeah it taught me to hustle
I'm a rebel with a cause, that said, let's get back to the struggle
Just left Chiraq, it's a war zone
Prayin' for my east side niggas, just hold on
What you know about a hundred rounds?
Nigga, they got drums on the Glocks now
Like De Niro off in Heat, niggas shoot at the cops now
I ain't tryna promote no violence
Until we fix this shit, just know a nigga won't be silent
I'm watchin' niggas gettin' smoked like hookahs
Go smoke a blunt and watch the news
Cause that shit there is sorta confusin'
They done killed another nigga
I said, "You sure, mothafucka?"
I will postpone this tour and start a war, mothafucka

[Hook]
I'm from a small hood and we big on respect
You get your money up, you go big on your neck
Hit the dealership and go big on the 'Vette
By any means, gotta get the check

Judge, does hoop shit, to hell with them laws
The revolution won't be televised on the net

[Verse 2]
Walk up in the white house like it's my house
Taxpayer mothafucka, yeah this is my couch
What the problem is, homie? The bills paid
Green grass, shooters out front, and I'm knowin' the crib raid
I ain't gon' act like this is all your fault
I roll a blunt, you grab a chair, we gon' sit down and have that talk
Racism at its all time high
And Taraji P. Henson at an all time fly
I'm like, "Lord why they tearin' up B-More?"
We do it then we do it all together, that's what DC for
Can't forget my riders off in Virginia
Tell 'em free B-More Goose, they put that boy in a blender
Gots up in here, politics player
Other than that
Drink a glass of red wine, smoke a cigar with the mayor
Down goes another nigga
I said, "You sure, mothafucka?"
I will step up out this pussy and start a war, mothafucka

[Hook]
I'm from a small hood and we big on respect
You get your money up, you go big on your neck

[Interlude]
Y'all don't wanna feel my wrath, not at all
Every hood, every penitentiary
Every ghetto, you do the math
This at the hood, you do the math, nigga

[Bridge]
I said I woke up this morning feelin' optimistic
But the survey say I'll be another statistic
Man these folk playin' dirty, shootin' niggas in the back
You look a man in his eyes, what type of coward shit is that?
I'm watchin' Anderson Cooper, what the fuck do we know?
And Al Sharpton show up like he some type of hero
Shit I'm startin' to think you here just for the press, mothafucka
You niggas better sell them chains, go buy a vest, mothafucka

[Hook]
I'm from a small hood and we big on respect
You get your money up, you go big on your neck
Hit the dealership and go big on the 'Vette
