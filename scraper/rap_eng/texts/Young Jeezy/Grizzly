[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I pull up in my cutlass hat cocked handling business
Fresh up out of court and I'm right back on my grizzly
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Ball like the playoffs Aston Martin take off
Take off, take off
Yeah bitch, take off
Got some goons, I got some goons
That's what I call a face off
Nigga face off, swish, nigga face off
Hit him in his ass
But I was trying to take his face off

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
50 packs of kushin nigga balling like I'm Zeebo
Ridge crest apartments I'm the neighborhood hero
More white than mayo now can you say swish?
I'm the king of Memphis and I be balling like a bitch
On my dope shit, coke shit, niggas know me
I'm the blueprint, the street shit, niggas owe me
Offense, water boy, you ain't play no D
Wide open shot and you ain't take it, you in the D league
Draft pick NBA shit, David Stern
Contract and a chopper bet these pussys gonna learn
You try to run go catch the people
Shot his ass with a buzzer beater
Nigga hit the trunk so many times
Nigga knocked the tweeters up out his speakers

[Hook: Yo Gotti]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Got on my old school penny's
See they know I'm winning, few real niggas
Like me but it really ain't many, true
I'm from North Memphis, (I am) chillin' on the courtside
Grew up down on Watkiss, went to school in North Side
Bitch I'm out here getting it may God be my witness
Any nigga put his hands on me then its gonna be a killing
Heart got no feelings, top got no ceilings
Cruising past Bill top dropped where the bitches
Peabody Presidential sweet 220
Tonight I'm hitting the pure and I'm a make it rain 20's
I'm on young nigga shit, I swear I sold it all
I had bricks the color of Battier and white as Marc Gasol

[Hook: Yo Gotti]

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
I be on my grizzly, I be on my grizzly
Four door Rari' white seats bout' Mckenzie
All these niggas claiming that they're real
Are really fakers
Rapping bout' the game and never play, commentators
Paid four blocks for the watch, thats a benzo
Whatcha' got hanging out the Glock, that extendo
Started with a 3.5 that's a 8 ball
Grind it up into a half a 9, thats a baseball
I know what it says on your shirt
What are kilo's?
Hide my money at my paper house, call it Kinko's
Club onyx album dallas ballin' like I'm JT
G5 Down in dade stuntin like I'm baby
