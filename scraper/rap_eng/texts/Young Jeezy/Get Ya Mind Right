[Intro]
I’m one of the realest niggas in this shit, man
I got the mothafuckin streets, nigga
I came in this game with everything I mothafuckin want
Nigga, this shit is about respectin me
Love to see when I walk up in the club
Nigga run up on me and tell me I’m the realest nigga livin
Nigga, you know what I’m sayin?

[Young Jeezy]
I'm the realest nigga in it you already know
Got trapper of the year four times in a row (what they give you?)
A lifetime supply of baking soda clientele
A Rolley watch, two pots and three scales
Can get bout 50 in the Hummer
The birds fly down south to Georgia for the summer
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Coke prices up and down like six-fours
Just cuz I'm fly like a helicopter
The federales on my tail call 'em bird watchers
Minus the bullshit life's great
Just got a camera in the peach in my license plate

[Young Jeezy]
It's not a trick question yeah I'm strapped bitch
Also ripped nigga miss me wit that rap shit
Rappin ass nigga better do numbers
I ain't gotta rap I'mma do numbers
A big shoot out on the highway
Jeezy hangin out the coupe lettin' it ride sideways
A straight g nigga don't tempt me
I'll lend you the whole clip til the shit empty
Big stacks yeah I got that
That's why I cop that Cris by the six pack
Got the fed lines ringin' like a telethon
Snitches want me locked up like Akon

[Young Jeezy]
Jeezy a rider, Jeezy a motherfuckin fool
Don't approach him like that you and Jeezy ain't cool
Jeezy a gangsta he rolls wit the real g's
And if he's smokin best believe its real trees
From L.A. Straight kush
Presidential shit call it George bush
Everyday is like a game call it fear factor
Gotta trunk full of bricks like a contractor
Seen niggas leave here and they ain't comin back
Left 'em slumped on the grain in his Cadillac
Jimmy crack corn, Jeezy flip O's
I just stick to the script y'all niggas hoes
