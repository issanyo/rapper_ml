[Lil Kim]
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uhhhhh
A boss bitch, work from home and she able
It's like Surgery Operations on the table
Cut it, cook it, bring it back
Flip it
Bring it back
Better have my money, if you don't nigga bring it back!
They puttin' orders in, with my Subordonates
Cause I got that uncut and I ain't never shortenin'
LOCK SMITH! I lock these hoes out really!
I'm the only bitch with the Keys in The City!
Bricks under-aged, I get'em under 20
And they ain't never growin' up, Peter Pan Wendy!
I got the fairy dust bitch!
I can make you fly, or at least believe it like R. Kelly when he high!
So don't disturb momma in the kitchen
Chefin' up the powder we gon' eat off what I'm mixing!
Me and them bird bitches don't mix in
That's why I went to jail for not snitching!

Youre the only nigga with the keys in the city
Bitches on you dog like some fleas in the city
Burn in ham, but the go to villain
In the club with this yellow gold chain
Bet you niggas never seen a yellow gold rains
Make a couplethrow some ds in that bitch
Make the mama say
Then go for 3 o nigga holler at a player
.. holler at the mayor, smoke nigga, ask the valee
Strapped up, fucked up
With the 40 cal Im a smooth operator
Ain't no question, Im a tool operator
What you know about the key stack, far as you can see
If a nigga die tonight, name the project after me

I'm the only nigga with the Keys in The City

I'm the only nigga, I-I,I'm the only nigga
I-I, I'm the only nigga with the Keys in The City

Whip It, Whip It real hard like a young willow
Quick to break a bitch down like a fuckin' Kilo!
Bout to shut down "The Carter" like I'm fuckin' Nino!
I'm Universal bitch
I distribute the shit!
I never flop but I throw a couple bricks
This that Columbian Godmother shit
Get a nigga clipped faster than a "bluntpiff"!
Sprinkle ashes on your corps!
You a worker tryin' go against the BOSS!
I got that cocaine flow like Griselda
Every sentence I speak is Paraphernalia!
I'm countin' money like a bank tella
The girl stay flyer than hellacopta' propellas'!
