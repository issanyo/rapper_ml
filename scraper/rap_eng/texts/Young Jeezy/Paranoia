[Intro: Dave East]
Got me peekin' through the blinds like Malcolm
Forty on me

[Chorus: Dave East]
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
These niggas fuckin' the package up
That bullshit they kickin' ain't adding up
Plus they don't get no pussy like Magic's son
Hundreds on hundreds, I stack it up
She bust that pussy then back it up
We standing on couches, we actin' up
I don't think these niggas mad enough
Patek cost me eighty, come add it up
Hands on my neck and my face, I got tatted up
I understand why they mad at us
But get out the way when the Phantom is backing up
You need to go on vacation and pack it up
Talkin' 'bout drugs but these niggas ain't trap enough
Niggas still tellin', I guess they ain't rat enough
Came a long way from them dimes in that Acura
So much ice, make 'em stare
Your wife got caught up in the lights like a deer
Living my life, though I know it ain't fair
They think I'm from 12th Street, I run with no fear
See the borough from the Lear, yeah
Brown diamonds look like beer, clear
Shots'll hit you, doctors screaming clear
I'm just paranoid, don't believe in scared
I can see the dead

[Chorus: Dave East]
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
I made a million a million times
They must've snorted a million lines
Mind playin' tricks, Willie D
Let my top down, ceiling me
Hermes, thirty on the hip
Vegas watch, hundred on the strip
Half a hundred hang up out the clip
Pop that pussy like I'm Uncle Luke
This marijuana got the best of me
When I land just have a vest for me
All these bad bitches wantin' saving
All this money, it gon' be the death of me
New Rollies for the gang gang
New chucks, yeah gang bang
Know some niggas down to hit the lick
Eighty-six a nigga for a brick

[Chorus: Dave East]
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one
Paranoia gettin' the best of me
I don't want nobody next to me
Don't talk unless you got a check for me
I don't see nobody ahead of me
Foreigns, we jump out the back of 'em
I cannot wait 'til this pack is done
Don't care if they foreign, we crashin' 'em
Take a look at my bitch, ain't a badder one
