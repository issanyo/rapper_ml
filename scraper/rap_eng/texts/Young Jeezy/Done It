[Verse 1]
Guess who's back in da building, mind on a million
And some bitch from Decater
She be holding my cash and I be holding her down
She be holding my work and I be dicking her down
Just got a call from the other side of town
Said he tryna come up, the opposite of down
I just hope he ain't the feds nigga I'mma do me
Said he coming right back
He gone need another three, two plates, four birds
One nigga ooh wee, Mr. 17.5, yea they know shawty low
Anything about blow betcha ya ass shawty know
And all the real bitches say go shawty goooo
Now I'm black tee wearing hell naw I ain't caring
And I'll wreck this bitch and come back in a McLaren
You know da feds staring, and I ain't even caring
I dust my 87's off nigga show them what I'm wearing

[Hook]
I done done it all
Magic City, Onyx, Strokers, Chevys, Benzes, Ferrari's, Porsches
You ain't never in your life seen a nigga this focused
And done it all in a pair of air forces [2x]

[Verse 2]
If it's a UFO then it's the FBI so I'm O-U-T
Nigga don't call me, thats your hot ass they really don't want me
Now your warm ass done got them all on me, so nigga
Worry bout you why you all on me?
Big stacks big straps yea it's all on me, if you ever in my city
Then it's all on me
If I'm ever in your city then it's all on me
New jail new cell old news, got a new grind
Myspace, Youtube, small plate
Greedy nigga big food, a good plug hard to find like Greek food
Got'em by the whole, and you don't even know but half
I'm talkin Lumpkin, Dumpkin, Madden ave, yeah my
Partner got arrested I got a new Lexus
I drove my new Lexus, to get a new necklace

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
A real nigga on top yall should be glad to see
Let me ask y'all a question and don't you laugh at me
See they call them thangs birds but I don't know why
Take them out the cage and they still won't fly
Take them out the wrapper and they still gonna sell
You can wrap them ten times and they still gonna smell
You can get a good lawyer but he still gon tell
You even can fix the cards and I still won't fail
I done did some business with Mariah, Lupe, Usher
Same 'ol Jeezy, young ain't no buster
Never said I was a saint never said I was an usher
So how ya'll gonna sit and tell me I ain't no hustler
I got bitches all round me young like Usher
Don't leave your bitch around me young might fuck her
Catch me in the club, me and my shooters
Sexy ass white drop top, hooters, broad day big bag
Getting money, 5 grand we have...
Rent money, real nigga till I die, get money, 20 bands left pocket
Tip money

[Hook 2x]
