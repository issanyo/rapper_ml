[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will
