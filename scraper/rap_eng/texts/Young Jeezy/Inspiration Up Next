[Verse 1:]
I'm alright, in a 5th of remy (Woo!)
From the city where the young niggas die skinny
Keep work on deck if you need any
Just holla at them boys cuz they keep plenty
Follow me
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders (Nah)
And I swear it feels like 10,000 boulders (Daymn)
And it's so heavy (YEAH!), but I'm so ready (AY!)
Feels like I was born for this (HA-HA!)
If not, at least I die for it
They said I couldn't do it but I still try for it (THAT'S RIIIGHT!)
The big question is "What could I do for the youth?" (YEAH!)
E'rybody lyin to em so I told em the truth, what's up

[Chorus:]
(I got hustle!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (AY!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!) (YEAH!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (HA-HA!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!)
Let's go

[Verse 2:]
Real niggas don't die, they go to the feds
Fresh out right back chasin' bread (YEAH!)
My life's so hard, so concrete
I was raised by em homie, that's why I think so street (Daymn)
Take me for instance, my life is not about you think me for instance (Yup)
I did the impossible, boy I made it out
Got dealt the pain here but I played it out (Yeeeeahh)
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast (AY!)
Now I'm thinkin holmes, got my right blinker on (HA-HA!)
Spread the word, get my Kurt Franklin on (YEAH!)
Stuntin' in traffic like dis my car
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far (far)
Life's a bitch, so I'm tryin the wiper (AY!)
Just ballin' 'round, you know buy some things
Lovin' every minute of it, still playin' for change, let's go

[Chorus:]
(I got hustle!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (AY!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!) (YEAH!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (HA-HA!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!)
Let's go

[Verse 3:]
Yeah my brush made me paint a perfect picture
Gotta pay attention cuz it's 3 dimensional
Same picture, see it one of the 3 ways (ways)
Let it, marinate it, it might take a few days (HA-HA!)
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence (Nah)
So I shouldn't say nothin', yeah a moment of silence
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense (sense)
Words to live by, took it out of context (Woo!)
Let's say your past is your present and your present is your cash (cash)
So I look forward to the future (YEAH!)
Get a little paper, your baby mama want half (Daymn)
Partly cloudy, so I need a forcast (AY!)
Where's the weatherman at when you need him (huh?)
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin' tell him, what's up

[Chorus:]
(I got hustle!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (AY!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!) (YEAH!)
One man, one stage, one mike
One song, one chance to get it right (HA-HA!)
Really thank ya'll we gonna see the night
And I think I know the way, Follow Me
(I got hustle!)
Let's go
