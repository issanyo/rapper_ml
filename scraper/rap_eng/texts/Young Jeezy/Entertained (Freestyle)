I got a couple hard cuz I used to sell soft
I kept my mouth closed and let my money talk
This shit can get dangerous ain't speak another language
I ain't have to say a word(Yeah) my paper speak spanglish

I just got a call my partner want ten
Could meet ya wide nigga you could bring it all in yen
The game gets deep the nights long if you ain't about this money take yo broke ass home
At the top of the crib yeah my roofs at my residents just a young democrat pocket full of presidents
Its a dirty world im just tryin to maintain listenin to prince blowin on some purple rain
(Hope Ya) the same young nigga nutin outta somethin took a chance took his thing to the mic
Criticize if ya want I say what the thought iz I proceed to get these niggas what they like
The same young nigga nutin outta somethin took a chance took his thing to the mic Criticize if ya want I do wat they thought iz I proceed to get these niggas wat they like
