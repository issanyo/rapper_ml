(Young Jeezy):
Man this beat to hard I ain't even gon' play with it
Beat the pussy up, I ain't even gon' play with it
Louie V loafers, D&G on the sofa
Hundred dollar bills on the table like they're coasters
You know how to find me, catch me in the mall
Sax 5th ave snatching shit up off the wall
See my jeans are designer
She know when I'm behind her
One thing about my shooters, yeah they gonna find ya
Big face rolly mother fucker I'm a shiner
Never been broke mother fucker I'm a grinder
Weed so good you gotta put it in the grinder
2:33 the first week I'm gon' remind ya
