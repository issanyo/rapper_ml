[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm a true balla Bitch call me melo
Seats on da wood at da finals like hello (hello)
My money how u doin
It's getting jealous cause I keep on addin to it
Niggas get murder cause dey don't know wat dey doin
Bitches get nervous cause she luv jus wat I'm doin
Dez niggas lookin cause dis music wat I'm doin
Keep ya bitches cause da riches wat I'm pursuin
See da phantom on da 4's, I call em new ones
Keep da baddest of da hoes
Look at my new ones
I get new guns, like t.I.p. do
I keep bomb money
Dats wat da bricks do

[Chorus:]
You just do you (and what), umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
You just do you (and what), umma do me, umma do me, umma do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me, watch me do me, watch me do me
Wanna see how it's done? Then watch me do me, watch me do me, watch me do me

[Verse 2: T.I.]
These niggas talking clean but they pocket clean
We spendin money getting money nuttin in between
Chasin a hundred mil ain't gon let nuttin intervene
Respect da hustle bustas gon do dat by any mean
Ay dis I really mean put dis on anything
Dey say I start a lot of shit I say I finish things
Jus like sum dental cream I go in niggas mouth
And like da limousine I stretch a nigga out
Dis ain't watchu want now u betta take a different route
I ain't bankhead bitch nigga wat is dis about
Use to be bound wen u c me oh we tensin now
Ay stop da music listen dude I cum get witcha now
But once dem hammaz seen u know it's not a dream
We handlin thangs jus like holla mean naw mean
You hearin sayin dat about me you hearin sayin it
New Orlean niggas in ya face you ain't sayin shit
Money you say u get 30 mil. in six yrs
Listen force put me down fa 20, dat was dis year
And let's get dis clear
Jus between you and me
Dat apology was fa B.E.T not D.T.P

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
If you ain't talkin bout money you ain't talkin bout shit
You wasn't on da waitin list den u ain't ridin in shit
And if ya watch didn't cost a hundred den you wasted yo time
If you think u can do me you out yo mothafuckin mind (let's go)
Dis nigga insane
Yea a straight fool
A half a million dollar car and sum house shoes
Call da dealer ships like ya'll trick me
Den y da hell u put my engine where my trunk be
I'm throwin franklins I don't need 1's
Smoke a pound every week like I don't need lungs
Buy em whole sales and sale em retails
Talkin sea food yea fish scales
I said I'm so hot but my house cool
So many rooms dat it looks like a high school
Speakin of high school I neva passed dat (Nope)
Works right hea
Now where da cash at

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Rocko]
You wear Reebok, I wear Bally
You smoke Michy, I smoke Cali
You wear Enyce, but I wear Louie
I drop 600 boys on dis guccis
You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one night her
You make it sprinkle, I make it tsunami
You get chump change, but I get money
You like dancing, I just two step
You like to trick off, but I don't do dat
You don't tote guns, I keep dat tooly
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!
