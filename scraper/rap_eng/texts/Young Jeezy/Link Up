[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na
Pour up, we gone drink up
Roll up, light the weed up
Hoes down, G's up
All the real ones link up

[Bridge: Beenie Man + (Jeezy)]
Everybody put your hands up
Cause its a rude bwoy link up
Smoke some weed and den we drink up
That's how the real ones link up
(That's how the real ones link up)
That's how the real ones link up
(That's how the real ones link up)
That's how the real ones link up

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Real nigga, bitch, I do real shit
Fuckin' with a real one, get your ass dealt with
Talkin' Glock 4 with the kickback
While I'm on the couch, champagne by the 6-pack
Stars on the ceiling bitch, think she in a spaceship
Stones in the Rollie bitch, think she on a day ship
A-Town stayed down, interrogated, not a sound
Soon as them birdie land, ship them bitches outta town
But when you catch the local niggas
Foreign cars at a red light
Caramel thing, yeah them big booty, red type
Where them bad bitches who always ask you what your bread like?
We don't even trip, we just ask 'em what their head like

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Beenie Man]
Fadda boo roll up, glass tint up
Glock inna mi hand like mi (?) up
Dem say dem wan' war so mi turn up
(Turn up fa wa?!) Di place burn up
How you fi diss ole dawg, when you a small pup?
Yuh nah dead tonight just hold a (?)
This ah nobody, this wah yuh buy round a Jacob
Yuh see me, gun ah catch E-cup
Hills and valley we cross
So like Jesus, we carry di cross
So everyone put yuh hands on yuh heart
And sing this song from start

[Hook + Bridge]
