Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I luv it, and I luv it, let's go

We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad broads at my show
Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I luv it, and I luv it

Once again it's on, yeah I'm back in the booth
The haters still lying, but your boys still the truth (yeah!)
I don't believe 'em, I need to see some proof
I need four doors, so I went and caught the coupe (haha!)

They tryin' be me, I'm just tryin' be G
And everything comes to da light, you'll see
Them boys in the dark baby I just shine (shine)
I do it from the heart homie, they just rhyme (yeeeeeahhhh!)

Check your watch, yeah it's my time (hey!)
Mind made up I was on my grind, that's right
So pay attention, yea you on my time
In that case time waits for no man

Do it again I done that before man (yeah!)
M.O.E., you ain't part of the program
Or maybe you n****s ain't listening
Open your eyes I'm a blessing in disguise

We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad broads at my show
Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I luv it, and I luv it

Yeah, I blew up, but they ain't like that
They switched up on me, and I ain't like that
Get my first lick, yeah, I came right back
Fast forward the tape, just look at me now

And I never turn back, so motherf*ck that
Nike's on the ground, got my head to the sky
Smoked all day, Lord knows I stay high
Stay on top, Lord knows I'm gon' try

And live for the moment, Lord knows I'm gon' die
And when I get to hell, Lord knows I'm gon' fry
I woke up this morning so I'm still alive
36 O's I sold them all for five

We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad bitches at my show
Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I luv it, and I luv it

Been around the world, it's the same ol' caine
Been around the world, it's the same ol' thang, dro
All the real n****s either dead or in jail
And if you're looking for me homie, I'm in the A T L
You gotta play it how it go, you can't cheat on life (yeaaaah!)
Ya better drink a Red Bull, you can't sleep on life
I ain't tryna do you, I'm tryin' do me
Last album did two, I'm just tryin' do three

Fresh out the pot yeah, the work was hard
Ride with the top down so I'm closer to God
My P.O. telling me I need a 9 to 5
But I already got a job, and that's stayin' alive

We count hundreds on the table, twenty's on the floor
Fresh outta work and on the way with some more
And I luv it (yeah!), and I luv it
I got gangstas in the crowd, bad broads at my show
Yeah, it's parked outside, and it's sittin' on fo's
And I luv it, and I luv it

Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it, and I love it
Ride till I die, Lord knows I stay high
And I love it, and I love it
