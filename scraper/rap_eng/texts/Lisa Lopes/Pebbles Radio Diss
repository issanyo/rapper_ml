[Left Eye]
1, 2, 3, go

[Left Eye & Chilli]
My pocket has a first name, it's B-R-O-K-E
My pocket has a second name, it's I have no money
Oh, I love to check them everyday
To see if they will stay that way
Cause the thief at best is nothing less than P-E-B-B-L-E-S
Oh, the thief at best is nothing less than P-E-B-B-L-E-S
Mi-mi-mi-mi
The thief at best is nothing less than P-E-B-B-L-E-S
Oh-
Take everything
Take everything
Take everything
Oh, the thief at best is nothing less than P-E-B-B-L-E-S
Thank you
