[Chorus : Yung Fly] x2


And baby girl its not that I don’t love you

It’s just girl I just really can't trust you

And im not trynna say that I don’t want you

It’s just I really can't trust you so I creep



And baby girl it’s not that I don’t  love you

It’s just girl I just really can't trust you

And im not trynna say that I don’t want you

It’s  just I really can't trust you so I  creep


[Verse 1 : Yung Fly]


Like TLC  im really happy that I got you right next to me

I can tell you opinions dont really matter to me

But would you really believe me if I said that see

To be honet, yeah I really like you

But im really  really trynna tell you
That I ain’t the type to

Ever try to play you and shit

But I took a couple losses
And I ain’t trynna end up like that again

Mess around and end up stuck

And it'll be just my luck

I mess around and lose the right one

I guess my mind all fucked up

Till I get it right for you girl, ima creep!



[Chorus : Yung Fly] x2


And baby girl it’s not that I don’t  love you

It’s just girl I just really can't trust you

And im not trynna say that I don’t want you

It’s  just I really can't trust you so I  creep



[Verse 2 : Yung Fly]


Like a monster in the sheets

I know you heard all of the rumors bout me like
How i had girl and i was creeping with shh...

But i just had to do her how she did me

And no i ain't a dog  cause im honest from the door
When they meet me

I tell em bout it all

But they still wanna keep me

Some of them say that they can manage  (damn...)


But then the sex bring damage

Cause then they start to fall

Then im with next girl

And they telling they girls

How they messing with a dog

But I can't help but just always be me

Be happy that im here and dont break your neck to keep me

Just know you got a number one spot

Im consistent with the love you just gotta give it back

Cause right now my mind all fucked up

But when I get it right for you i’ma stop


Till then i’ma creep i’ma creep


[Chorus : Yung Fly] x2


And baby girl it’s not that I don’t  love you

It’s just girl I just really can't trust you

And im not trynna say that I don’t want you

It’s  just I really can't trust you so I  creep


[Outro : Yung Fly]



And baby girl it’s not that I don’t  love you

It’s just girl I just really can't trust you

And im not trynna say that I don’t want you

It’s  just I really can't trust you so I  creep
