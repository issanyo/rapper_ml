A lonely mother gazin' out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body layin' cold in the gutter, listen to me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place, y'all, don't hear me

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Ah c'mon
I seen a rainbow yesterday
But too many storms have come and joined
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray, all ten fade away seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional
Skies have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps them in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tootin' caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane and ain't this day and time for fallin'
Prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Oh you're moving too fast

Don't go chasin' waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
