Intro:
This one right here goes out to everybody
And it doesn't matter who your are
Cause I know that everybody has a friend

Verse 1:
What defines a friend, the meaning
Where does it lie
In the mind, in the money, in the face, in the eyes
In the days, in the nights, well what is a friend
Do you love it and leave it again and again
So now our story begins of two little friends
You would have thought they were twins
Would have thought they were kin
Wouldn't think they can bend
Because all the time they would spend
For each other they would fend
For they friends to the end
Their mothers know mothers
Sisters know brothers
Mothers know fathers
Sons know they daughters
They blood thicka then water
If one had fifty cents they'd both have a quarter
That only makes sense, adjusting levels and all
They grew up together from pre-k to high school
Winters in the snow, summers in the pool
He's and athlete, she's an actress
But hormones would lead them

Chorus:
You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame
Forever and ever, we will remain
We will remain friends

Verse 2:
Not furious just curious
She saw himself fit
Who better than the boo the girl grew up with
How bout the walks in the park
On the phone all night
Dreams like that she saw in plain sight
To his friends he's urgent
Simple fact she's a virgin
To her he'll be urging sexually lets merge
As you can see there's two different dreams
Her thoughts are so pure, his low as the floor
She's looking he?s balking
Now walking and talking
Bout a new stage and phase
That they should embark in

So it came to that length
No dinner, no candlelight
The female exhales
Something doesn't feel right
She said it polite, honey please not tonight
Cuz he didn't get any, he got real malignant
Hit her, it hurt, her breath got suspended
Then he looked at his work not feeling

Chorus:
You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame
Forever and ever, we will remain
We will remain friends

Verse 3:
Their meeting had ended
Feeling offended, he went and attended
To a counseling session
Now life is a lesson
Full of questions
Why be drowned down
Rather than manifested
Went to his friend right from the beginning
With tears in his eyes he said I apologize
She much obliged, made amends
Once again, they're friends to the end
Yea, it was true love again
As transparent as when
A parent is caring
What defines a friend
Where does it lie
In the mind, in the money, in the face, in the eyes
In the days, in the nights, what is a friend
Did you love it and leave it again and again
In time in the sadness in the hurt in the pride
It's the person dispersing through the hands of time

Chorus:
You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame
Forever and ever, we will remain

You have been there, through thick and thin
Always beside me, you are my friend
More than money, fortune, or fame
Forever and ever, we will remain
We will remain friends
