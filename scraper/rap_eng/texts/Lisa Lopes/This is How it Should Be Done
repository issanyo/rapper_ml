This is how is should be done
This is how it should be done comin' out of the black shade
Fightin' to lighten a path made back
Let's go way back to the beginnin'
That's when an idea took part from the start
Listen to another Marley beat I'm impatient
I gotta leave my seat for motivation
Pump the bass what's next
Kckin' the steps me and the mirror's havin' wreck
So hard that I cracked my neck
And I'm poppin sweat now I'm soakin' wet
But I feeeel it
Grab the beat cause I must
Defeat it's a funky groove
So I steeeel it
To improve what could
Soon be the Left Eye move
Pin it down and snatch a sample to loop it up
And start makin' my own example cause

[Chorus:]
This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done (yeah, yeah)
This is how it should be done
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none

This is how it should be done steppin' into a shade a bit lighter
Now is the time to write a rhyme a rhythmic type of memo
Tick-tack it to the track it is now my demo-kay
What's to da where's to go yo I don't know
Who's to see see ya at the local show
Me and Mo takin' a chance and he's dancin'
Round and round the deck as I flow
But what an awkward situation
Cause there's not much crowd participation
For checkin' me out I'm too new it
Gots to be somethin' else another way to do it
So I sit back and think for a minute
Which city needs a little more talent in it
Maybe A.T.L. is the place packed up left Philly gotta hit LaFace

[Chorus]

This is how it should be done (hey)
This style is identical to none

This is how it should be done and I'm comin' through
Grippin' the mic spittin' out what's after verse 2
And ready to rock the spot cause I'm on it
They wanna see what I got
Givin' it all and makin' it seem so simple to be myself
Along wit' doin' what I do
Cool they want me not knowin' I'm soon to be the "L" of TLC
Word up T.B.O.Z. that's T-Boz
Saucin' it up is Chilli
We three alike all small in height but I'm Left Eye
Cause the eye is right
So now they thinkin' well is we ready enough
Yeah it's time to get busy
The aftermath is the brightest path so far
Yo cause here we are

This is how it should be done
This is how, this is how

[Chorus]
