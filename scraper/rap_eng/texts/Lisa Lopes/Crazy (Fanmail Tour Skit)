(Preformed on the FanMail Tour)

Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing crazy-sexy-cool
Crazy
What is crazy
Something we find profound
One having flaws or cracks untied
Found mentally unbalanced deranged
Psychopathic
Insane
You know they say there's a fine line
Between genius and insanity
Like the difference between
Fine english and profanity
It's like walking the tightrope between stormy and clear
Through the eyes of left eye
Here we go
Have no fear

I'd like to introduce myself
My name is crazy
When I say "what's my name? "
Y'all say "crazy!"
Chorus:
What's my name
Crazy!
My claim to fame is
Crazy!
Left eye better known as
Crazy!
'cause when I'm on the throne i'm
Crazy!
Now tell me how ya feel
Crazy!
Who is ya keepin' it real wit'
Crazy!
What's the name of this song
Crazy!
It goes on and on like
Crazy!
As I hit you with this first line
Get you with this nursery rhyme
Left e-y-e psycho in the mind
Gemini is my zodiac sign
Feel the beat get ya mind
Feel the track rewind
When you see me throw up the l three times
Y'all got that
The l three times
Come on throw up the l three times
Let me know that ya know your signs
In numerology the number is 9
These bombshells comin' more devine
Now feel the energy
'cause now is the time for the crazy left eye to shine
But ya know sometimes
I just feel like
A flower in the jungle
It just kinda makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under
But then a light seems to pop into my head
Speaking of lights anybody got a light
Anybody got a house?
Just kiddin'
Alright what we have here
Is a string
This string has been treated
With nitroglycerine
Do you guys have my light ready
Alright y'all ready

Chorus

Comin' back with verse two
It's the angelic being
Some call me left eye
Others call me crazy
Sexy-cool
But no fool
Twenty-five million sold
And that's the truth
I thank you you you and you
Just keep buyin' baby
I keep rhymin' baby
And tlc will keep climbin'
Tlc will keep climbin'
A visionary emcee in my own little world
Arsonist yes it's me I'll burn up your curl
Take that get me back on the left hand side
You're feelin' crazy let's rock
But sometimes
I just get this wild hair up my ass
Squigets hand me my balls
Not those sweaty stinking balls
My juggling balls

Chorus

To accomodate this new geometry
A rhyme that's desired
A world premeire in the history of time is required
The crooks wanted yesterday
Wanna blaze the new way
For you and I and the things we have to say
So the new you to you I'll showcase a few
Events with mania that makes no sense
See I'm a diamond in the rough
Beautiful but tough
Quick to call your bluff
Think you've had enough
Open up your mind
Look what others have dared
Let your light shine
With a little savoir faire
I'm out all night
I'll check the tunes and then it's you
I'ma keep rhymin'
For my fans and my crew
But sometimes
I feel a little ebony
And then ivory
So I must expose
The beethoven inside of me
Move over buddy

Chorus

Give it up for left eye
