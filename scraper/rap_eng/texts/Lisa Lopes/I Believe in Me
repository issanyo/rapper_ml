This Jam is dedicated to Moi
That's right you guys
Just For.....

Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me

Everybody says they know me better than I know myself
But I don't know nobody else that felt what I felt
Did what I did, or been where I been
But, had to defend myself again and again
Let it end where it begins, who cares what the cause is
Too many bosses cause divorces, and I don't take losses well
I play with the team, but I am Diana Ross, and not a Supreme
You think you got me all figured out
So I'm so shallow the only thing I'm trying to get is a bigger house?
No, part of my need is a company
So I can hire out my own people to live out their own dreams
So tell me, what's happenin to all yall people with low self esteem
What, what, what, you want me to cry on your shoulder
So you can turn around and laugh and talk about it when it's over?

Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me
I done sold 30 mil, dated the man you wanted
When it got too convenient, I just gave it up
I don't need the stress, I don't need the pain
I do need the checks, but don't need the game
Oh my how could him and I, be the same
When the house burnt down, only I took the blame
When the money got
Funny, I took it court
When most of y'all scrubs, wouldn't have even fought
When the group had issues, I layed in the thought
I corrected the bad news, I heard in intervers
Tell me do you really know Lisa, not many
It's not contrary to fear, I don't know you either
I'm responsible for more than you will ever see
So many things you don't know, happen because of me
From Blaque to the designs of the stage, that was me
So how could any of y'all be mad at me

Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me

Everybody says all they want the truth
Well the truth is that I still got love for my group
But you don't really want the truth when it's concerning you
You want to hear that no one is doing better than you
You love to hear the
Pain, you love to hear the struggle
You love to know
That paradise, has got
Trouble
The only trouble we ever had is you being around
Do not get involved, where you do not belong
When my faith started to waver, I felt was like I was done
I felt like Brian McKnight, I was back at one
The only one that was, the only one and ever
The only one I need, the one and only me
Because if I ever told you it was all on a different plane
You would think that I meant our flights ain't the same
My my crime is that I was so blind
Didn't know I had everything that I wanted all the time

Me
I believe in me
Cause I take care of me
Took so long to see
All I really need is me
Faith and family
Finally made me see
No matter what I think
All I need is me
