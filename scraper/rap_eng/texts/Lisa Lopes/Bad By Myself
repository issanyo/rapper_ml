Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip
Yo, get, get up on the TLC tip

Hey now

[Verse 1]
You know how to pull my chain
And I believe every word you say
But now it's time to say goodbye
Baby, I'm leaving, so don't you cry

I tried to make things work
But now you're gone and your heart got hurt
Well you thought I belong to you
But you were wrong. so now what ya gon' do?

[Chorus:]
Bad by myself
I can do bad, bad by my damn self
I can do bad by myself
Yo I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

Verse 2]
Don't come bangin' on my door
Now you're gone I don't want you anymore
There's no reason for you to come around
So just step off so I don't have to break it down

I know what I'm doin' now
You think you're gonna change my mind somehow
You cheated me now I'm cheatin' back
I run the show and you can kiss my (you know the rest)

Yo, Left Eye, what it is?

But my time can't be wasted on B.S
So never mind

[Chorus]
Bad by myself
I can do bad, bad by my damn self

Yo, I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

[Interlude Rap: Left Eyes]
Yo, I can do bad all by byself
I sur don't need you and anyone else
I ain't gonna be a fool no more
Better take that mess on out the door
Tried to ruin my world, tried to run my life
Must be crazy thinkin' I'm your wife
Yo, I done it before and I can do it again
Sure don't need you to be my man

Yep, yep (hey) get up on the TLC tip

Yo, I done it before and I can do it again

[Bridge Rap: Let Eye]
Yo if Peter Piper weas to pick ya know a peck o' those pickled
Peppers gave his girly little Shirley half a peck
He could've kept her but instead da picklehead
Was kicked out da waterbad
And greedy Petey now is needy cause not one was all that he left her
Oooooooh I'm sayin' it once and not twice
Givin' advice to be nice before you fall through the ice
Cause lately you been slippin' up a lot
Not even givin' half o' what you got
But it's about that time you gave a quarter for a dime
Shovel up and start diggin' to see what you can find
That security deposit
So like it or leave it but until I receive it
I'll be leavin' my deposit elsewhere
You best belive it
And that way we can both take a trip
Oooh on the TLC tip

Now that's the one
