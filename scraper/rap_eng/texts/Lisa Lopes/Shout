[Left Eye (T-Boz and Crowd vocals)]
(Shout)
What's up ya'll (Owwww)
It's Left Eye on the track (Owwww)
My girl T-Boz over to my left (Owwww)
Chilli is on my right (Yeah)
We gonna teach ya'll to shout (Owwww)
Unhh (Owwww)
Check it out (Owwww, yeah)
What's up, what's up, ooh

[T-Boz]
Same damn time every hurt or two
Something can happen to put me in the mood
Keep it inside 'til I turn dark blue
Trash everything I ever gave to you
Wrote it on the front of your Lexus Coupe
Didn't want to leave you with a lame excuse
Sex so good turns love to abuse
When you want it loose, got you in a noose

	[Chilli]
1 - 	It's not just when I'm in bed
	Sometimes it's so frustratin'
	I keep it all in my head
	'Till I just can't take it no more
	It's not just when I get mad
	Sometimes it's cuz I'm so glad
	That you are near me now
	I just have to get it out

2 - 	Shout!
	You gotta let me get it out
	You gotta let it go away
	Don't wanna spend another day
	Unless I feel like you make me

	Shout!
	You gotta let me get it out
	The feeling won't go away
	Don't wanna spend another day
	Unless I feel like you make me

Shout!

[T-Boz]
Found somethin' in your pocket
And I don't know why
I didn't say nothing' just sat and cried
Got me twisted all out inside
Not too long before the next ride
Over and over and over again
Instead of lettin' out I always let it in
This is where the confusion begins
Cuz if you don't make me, you don't win

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[T-Boz and Chili]
Baby just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
Cuz sometimes I need you to turn me out
Cuz that's what lovin' is all about (shout!)
Baby just tell me what you wanna do
I can't help bein' in love with you
Cuz sometimes I need you to turn me out
Cuz that's what lovin' is all about (shout!)
Yeah

[Left Eye]
Check it
I knew that it was only time before my rhymes
Would dig into my mind and get crazy out of line
I do my best to never disrespect
My girls in TLC or my friends
So let me speak my love and peace (shout!)
All about in this world full of doubt
Is you down for the count
Do your hoe's still amount to the price that we pay
To remain up in this crucial game
Call it a test, a game of chess, let's play
Me and you, one on one, breakin' the ice 'til the water runs
Down my face like a chase, now do you hear the guns
Here I come and won't quit until the job is done
Quiet storms will inform you that I've just begun
Tippin' the spot 'till it's hot if you want what I got
See me down to the dot-dot-com
And keep it comin' with your best shot
If you're sure or can rely, then let's not

Repeat 2
