[Intro]

Ladies and Gentlemen!
Yes my fine gentlemen friends
Okay, we're gonna turn to the chapter in Eyenetics
Called Left Pimping
Everybody turn to Left Pimping
Now as you can see
It's located in a region near your man
Called untitled space

[Left Eye]

If it's your man
Then why the hell is he chillin' in my ride (why)
He told you he was faithful
The nigga must have lied (precisely)
The nigga must have tried
Just to abide
Your committin' stride
He put that shit aside
When I spread that like fungus (lesson number one)
If size came with age
He's far from the youngest
That brother's humongous
Oh how the hell his tongue is (number two)
Adoring cunnalingus
How I run this ruckus (how I bring it like this)
It's jammin' like Smuckers
Fuck this
Wonderin' why he ask for cash
When holidays arrive
But time is money
And his pockets don't survive
I'm quite the investment
Hot and incandescent
Cristal eporvesence (Y'all do Moet)
Makes my smile go crescent
I be big pimpin'
Try to stop my intentions
I think you're whipped

[Chorus}

You be
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how your man be dippin'
Stop slippin' slippin'
Stay Left Pimpin'
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin'
Stop bitchin' bitchin'
And do the Left Pimpin'
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
On how your man be dippin'
Stop slippin' slippin'
Stay Left Pimpin'
You'll be wishin' wishin'
Lippin' lippin' lippin'
Stop bitchin' bitchin'
And do the Left Pimp

[Brett]

My pops said
Once you give a chick
All the dick you stuck
So I give 'em half
And try to stay one step up
Now you gotta know that I carry
My game tight
I'm tryin' to meet ya, feed ya
Fuck ya the same night
Beat it now the daylight
Mean tongue want me to see what it taste like?
I know you do
But I'm a pimp first
Watch what you ask for
Half Hispanic chicks call me Cockerspaniel
Samples ain't free (uh uh)
Born Brett Pimp
For some of this here
You gots to pay me
Don't' love y'all broads
Let y'all tongue massage this dick
Also balls
Give you back shots and big 4-door cars
Love how your head bob up and down like see-saws
See Ma I want you to understand somethin'
A man's compelled to be with more than 1 woman
As long as I keep you cummin' you shouldn't complain
You do you, I do me
Simple and plain
Fam mover
Hit hard like Zab Juda
Mack come on
I wrote the script with Mack Jr

[Left Eye]

Did I forget to mention (listen up now)
Don't mean to be bitchin'
But I'm short of Benjamin
If you a lame hoe
Lend ya man
So my regimen produces regiments
Of many men
Of many skins
From Black, Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian kin
If your body right, mind right
Pockets can't be tight (write it down)
Where you goin' tonight?
Where the moon is bright
Fly away hoe
Take flight
Outta sight
'Cause money on the side helps from outside
Reside in the ride chauffeur
Well I'll drive
With rims that be nice
More Benz than rice
System's too nice
Them new purple headlights be too bright
Engine of might
That scream like a bitch
About to lose they life
All these things come about
Due to the clout
These niggas I scout
Standin' strong and stout
I bring out a spout
'Cause there's no drought
When the loot flow out
(Come on)
(Yeah)
(Huh)
(Left pimpin')

[Outro]

Now as we bring this class to a close
There is one last thing that we must review everybody
All right, it's called the Left Pimp Dance
Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna put your left foot in front
Leeeeeean to the left
And dip
Come on y'all dip
Do the Left Pimp
Come on
Everybody dip
Do the Left Pimp
Yeah yeah yeah
Dip
Do the Left Pimp
Come on
You ain't skippin' you ain't pimpin'
Come on
Do the left pimp
Yeah
You ain't kickin' you ain't pimpin'
Get it up
Do the left pimp
