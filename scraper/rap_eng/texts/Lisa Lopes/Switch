[TLC] (Jermaine Dupri)
Switch (check it)
Switch (TLC, I like that)
Switch (turn it up)
Switch (aight)

[T-Boz]
I ain't one to be questioned
About who and where I've been
I ain't one to be questioned
About what time I came in
Tryna squeeze, baby please
Hit the road and don't come back
Cause I can't trust a relationship
With no trust and that's a fact

1 - [TLC]
Switch
Don't take no mess from nobody
Switch
If they act up just leave 'em alone
Switch
Don't take no mess from nobody
Switch
When you're done wit 'em you can send 'em home

[T-Boz]
I won't answer to no one
Until I feel I'm ready to
I'm gonna have my fun
Doin' the things I like to do
See, I need space, get off my case
Stop breathin' down my back
Cause we ain't got a relationship
If that's how you have to act

[Chilli]
Commitment, true devotion
Right now is not the way for you to come at me
When I need it, I'm sure you'll be the first to know
But for now, in my plans, no demands
I'm gonna have to make a switch

[Left Eye]
Switch, throw his behind in a ditch
While my definition states, as it relates
To us mates, one elimintaes
And solely contemplates and de associates
Like my new drink was V-8's
Just as quick as I get in it
I drop 'em in a minute
Like the dollars in my pocket
Speedy Gonzales couldn't stop the way I spin it
I'm known for breakin' every speed limit
This switch could be infinite
I said L to da E to da F to da T to da E to the Y
Because I'm so fly
Bring it back to the E
So come and see me
At the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn (say what?)
I said if your man starts actin' up
Switch and take his friend
Erase, replace, embrace new face, come on
Erase, replace, embrace new face

Repeat 1 to fade
