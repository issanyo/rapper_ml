(What what)
(Yeah yeah)

From Phila-delph-I-A
To Egypt
Now won't you come my way
I got a crush on you and don't know what to do
I don't know what to do (uh yeah yeah)
I don't know what to do (uh yeah yeah)

Sittin' at my window pane
Contemplatin' the right thing to say (oooh)

Baby I know you're with her
But would you be as happy
As you would be if you were with me (uh uh)

I tried to hide this for awhile
But it just fills up inside
She can't love you like I do (uh come on)
But you chose to be her man

Chorus:
Boy I can't deny
These feelings that I feel inside
I got a crush on you
And I don't know what to do
Boy I can't deny
These feelings that I feel inside
I got a crush on you
And I don't know what to do


I know that you are still wonderin'
Why I lied to you
And said that she wasn't right for you
But all I see is you right here
Lovin' me
Holdin' me
And that's just how it should be (how it should be)

I tried to hide this for awhile
But it just fills up inside
She can't love you like I can
But you chose to be her man

Chorus

[N.I.N.A
Tick tock tick tock
Strickly dickly dock

My heart ran up the clock
The clock struck one
My learnin's just begun
The clock struck two
That's one for me and one for you
To turn me over and see
Don't wake me up if I'm dreamin'
You got me feanin' like Jodeci (pain)
Now what is the meanin'
Hollerin' and screamin' out your name like I just came
Exploded like a supernova fully loaded
Mentally corroded with episodes of you and I
Picture you walkin' by
Missin' you and don't know why
Wishin' you will always be mine all mine
Kissin' you like candy while I listen to your sweet replies
I can't deny these feelin's that I have for you
I've got a crush on you and don't know what to do

So should I *kablow*
I can't be stopped
Like the cops in a hot pursuit
*Pow* who shot me
Like cupid I'm love stupid
Like round trips to Egypt
I"ll take my lasso and loop clear around your whole body
Miss N.I.N.A. here to rock it like a Clue party
I should get lit on fire
Cuz I'm a true hottie
