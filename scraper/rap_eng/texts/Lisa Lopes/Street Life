[Verse 1: Left Eye]
The other night, I decided to walk down the block
I heard all this noise at 12 o' clock
Sirens, guns, and police, dogs barking
Three paddy wagons pull out from parking
Filled with people from off the street
And just committing all crimes in the city, you see?
They're killing innocent people by the wink of an eye
Drug-dealers helping kids get all high
They don't care about nothing
They have no home
They're either living with the gang, or all alone
Guys have twenty kids
Never had a wife
Well that's what you get, when you live street life

[Verse 2: Left Eye]
Girls become prostitutes at the age of ten
Running away from their pimps, again and again
Some do it cause of parents
They take revenge
Well little do they know, right to hell they'll sin
Some think it's cute to be a prostitute
They're looking for money, not giving a hoot
Yo man with girls, I'll never understand it
How could you sell her body, just to be damaged?
Your sick in the head and always ready for bed
You don't know if they'll return alive or dead
They go through all kinds of pain, misery, and struggle
Well that's what you get, when you live street life

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
And what about the little babies being born to pipers
So helpless, addicted to crack in their diapers
Yeah, some babies make it, but the rest they just die
One week on Earth and already it's goodbye

[Verse 4: Left Eye]
Here's a rap about me
Q.T. (cute teen), what is me?
Quality and degree of excellence
In other words superior-ier-iority
First class
Well last is me
Clear as glass
Forever be a V.P
Not just a C-U-T-I-E

[Verse 5: Left Eye]
I'm always ready, never deadbeat
Anything the doctor order
You gon' order, this mean the lunches
Never palm or sour water
Full of Lord of corresponding
More than the sistas that I like
Sort of touchy-touchy what?
That I'm a master of the mic
Vroom, vroom, on my own
I write my rhymes, when alone
So knick-knack paddywhack
Give your dog ha-ha
Bona fide, that's me and you try
To get wit' forget it admit it
You just bloop! so quit it and let it
Cause creating the rhymes makes sense
And you'll find
Takes time like climbing a fence
You get higher and higher, until you reach the barbwire
Stop! like you were catching on fire
