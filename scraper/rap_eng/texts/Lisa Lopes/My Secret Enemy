      Now I lay me down to sleep
(That was then but this is now)
I pray the lord my soul to keep
(I let you slip away some how)
If I should die before I wake
(If I should die my pain shall stay)
I pray the lord my soul to take
(I made you what you are today)

Now as I look at myself
I'm seeing someone familiar starin' back at me
Through every deep crack that's in my mirror
And as I think to myself
I'm hearin' somebody else scream at me (shhh)
I no longer hear em
Could it be the unknown sneaking into my zone
Off we roam, my spirituals is not alone
I'm visualising this invisible clone
It's my own, and its own, rest assured its my dome
Maybe I need to got to bed
Could have sworn I just heard that voice up in my head
Not while I raps when it hits me (ha ha ha ha)
But now its laughing at me
Yo what the hell is happening please, somebody slap me
No way, not another physical display
Something must got me backin' out from way back in the day
But what can it be I can't recall the memory
So if I may ask...

(I just seen you yesterday)
It's my fuckin' past x7

By any means was all it ever seemed to be
This reminiscin' with my past has got me caught up in a daydream
Stayin' bent with niggas who can pay the rent
Spending my greetings on pantyhose and tight jeans
I used to be so amused
Coz the tools that I used to break rules
Only seemed to confuse as to whose being abused
Place yourself in my shoes
My pleasant look of innocence was never refused
Now that I choose to abide
(Hello left eye)
And put my past to the side
(I don't guess I...)
And kill a piece of my pride
(... need to introduce myself huh you already said hi)
Oh, so you're the match that lights my fuse
(Amused?)
I thought I left you on that cruise
(You lose it your man took my place when he threw me in your face)
So we drank up all the booze
(Sing the blues)

And yo we end up on the news
(Sing the blues)
We end up on the news
(Sing the blues)
We end up on the news
(Sing the blues)
I said we end on the news
(Sing the blues) x2

Got to get away from the past
If I make it I just might last
Got to get away from the past
Tryin' to escape it but it's moving too fast x2

We was walkin' before most babies could crawl
(Yes yes y'all)
Above all, one foot tall ain't no way I'm taking a downfall
I'm restructuring walls, interrupting your calls
And going straight to the source with this nut in my balls
Every time, the blind lead the blind
Another one of my kind's outta sight and outta mind
(I'm coming through the press)
With this sense you can't mess
(Sittin' in your dreams)
Go ahead, take a rest
(I'm poppin' off your nigga's chest)
Should I be in distress?
(And nigga's poppin' on the scene)
And they can get these
That's my bitch, I'm his bitch
And what the hell do they know
(Is that so?)
They say they case scenario
And I could care less
About your people and their relentlessness
Towards the eye, say goodbye
And tell his moms to stop cryin'

Go tell his moms to stop cryin'
His moms to stop cryin'
Go tell his moms to stop cryin'

My secret enemy ain't no friend of me
My secret enemy ain't no friend of me
My secret enemy ain't no friend of me
My secret enemy
