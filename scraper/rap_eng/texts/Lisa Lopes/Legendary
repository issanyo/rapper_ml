Untouchable
Look at how you found me
I'm lookin' around sayin' these are my friends
It's a strange world my enemies are my friends
I'm on the same street, same world, same problems
Is it different?
Same drama, same karma, same mama
Is it different?
The only difference is me
I see inside the truth
Feel bad you don't know the day gon' come
When God has taken you
I see the invisible spirits, walkin' along the physical mind
Of a crazy individual
Where demons still find it livable
I need a hug to hold my soul inside my body
I got the secret here
Yeah, I should have told somebody
Cause ever since I've been sayin' things I never meant
It's like I was speakin' in tongues, the black breath in my lungs
I won't allow it
Where the cowards live under the dirt and the flowers
Ready to come up in the darkest hour
It ain't the courage of my persona
You wanna admire it's the faith
Cause with the faith I can walk through the fire
(Now feel me)

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Echoing inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Using the light from my wings that make us fly together

Sometimes I'm feelin' like I'm sinkin'
Thinkin' what it's like from on the other side
When I look at myself it's like my love had died
People thinkin' of gettin' richer
I'm usin' the blood of the loves that I lost recently
To paint a perfect picture
Can you see the future, future endeavors
That'll make us better
Usin' the light from my wings to make us fly together
Guide my people to a place like what we imagined
My duty now is to God
There's no more beauty pageants
With the creator, we getting the chance to thank 'em
Me and you finally for what they made us
Is it a game that we still playin'
Look at us now we're rid of grief
Payin' society's debt but life we still obeyin'
Until then I'll follow the path
Where will it lead?
Much in between ashes and dust
We must believe
Trickery ain't trickin' me
I got tricks up my sleeve
They tryin' to market I'm tryin' to make my mark before I leave

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Echoing inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Using the light from my wings that make us fly together

Untouchable
Echoing inside my soul
Echoing inside my soul

I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Echoing inside my soul
I know you feel me it's the untouchable
Untouchable
Make yourself presentable
I'm listening to mysteries of the untold
Using the light from my wings that make us fly together

Echoing inside my soul
Echoing inside my soul
