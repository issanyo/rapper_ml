[Left Eye]
You know
Somebody once told me that dreams are fantasies with the possibility of becoming a reality

[Bootleg]
I'm havin' the type of fantasies ridin' under palm trees
A Corvette convertible feelin' the summer breeze
Conversations on the phone till the night ends
I'm sayin' things that make you wanna tell your girlfriends
The fireplace is burnin' hot and your body sweats
Massage my back while I'm passin' you the MoÃ«t
Your Liz Claiborne got me on a natural high
Your toes polished, ankle bracelets make you look fly
No need to rush baby hold me like a love story
And you ain't frontin' cause I know you got love for me
How does it feel to be alone with the Rock Capone
To come together makin' love, it's like a quiet storm
Your pretty smile makes me wanna put my drink away
And push play so we can listen to some Marvin Gaye
This is my fantasy I'm hopin' it'll come true
A life of happiness together baby me and you
Holdin' hands takin' cruises on the blue sea
Sendin' you flowers at your job makes you think of me
And all my partners say I'm trippin' but I'm sayin' screw 'em
Cause every gangster got a sentimental side to him
So let's enjoy all the days and all the nights alone
We riddin' horses in the fields by our summer home
I pray to God cause I hope you understandin' me
Now close your eyes, let's fly, cause baby your my fantasy

[Hook] x4
I'm having fantasies
I'm having fantasies
Romantic fantasies
Baby of you and me

[Left Eye]
Now, what would I do if I was sittin' on top of the world?
Money and fame was written like diamonds and pearls
Cadillac's to Lamborghini's to name a few
Silent dreams in my head to ride away wit' you
In the midst of the night, I'll stand and leave it all
Just one look in your eyes would keep me standin' tall
And I would never look back to see the things that I miss-
Headed for white sand beaches and phenomenal bliss
Watchin' waves cascade and break up in the midst
Sippin' wine form seashells that touch your satin lips
Too many kisses got me addicted, I need a fix
Intoxicated and open to whatever you wish
All our dreams, you and me, chromed out GS 3's
? bombs on the coast of overseas
Virtual fantasies of virtual reality
Never leave and I promise to keep my sanity
Wishin' wells, casting spells that they would never tell
Pot of gold's, what I'm told, follow the rainbow swell
Skinny dipping in the water before the night's demise
Tossin' pennies in the sand and cop the sunrise
What we can do in a minute is worth eternity
Every second you up in it is total ecstasy
IRA, independent and real in attitude
It's fantasy dot com keepin' you in the mood

You got me sleeping wit' my left eye open, hopin' that your seein'
All of the things that me and you is capable of being, becomin'
Because I know that you really want it
Gettin' blunted bendin' corners in the black 600
On a mission baby the fantasies are comin' true
Drippin' honey on your body to lick it off of you
Open your mouth baby, and taste the strawberries
Ice cream, double scoops comin' from Ben and Jerry's
Summer time we recline on my Ninja Katana
In the mall we can ball bumpin' to Atlanta
Your body on my body in special places
Makin' love while I'm watchin' you make them funny faces
In the zone nobody's home when we intertwine
You snuck yours, now baby I'm comin' for mine
Tossed salad, love ballads, the Jacuzzi was greater
Than the time we made love in the movie theater
Candlelight dinners, motion lotion, edible panties
Limousine rides droppin' us off at the Grammy's
Got awarded and you promised that you'd never forget me
Blowin' kisses in the crowd aimin' them so they hit me
Skip the after parties it's time to chase some waterfalls
So I creep to locations where no one can call
I been diggin' on you way since back in middle school
For three reasons you crazy, sexy, and cool
