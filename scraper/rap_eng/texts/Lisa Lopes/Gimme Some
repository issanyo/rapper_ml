[Verse 1: Toni Braxton]
It is an age-old story
Goes back back to Adam and to Eve
I know you know
What I want for
And if it ain't clear to ya baby
Don't stop, let's Rock
Give it to me baby

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Gimme gimme
Gimme some Gimme some

Gimme some gimme some
Don't fight what you you can't son
Yea yea yea yea yea

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton]
You know you can't ignore it
I'm always there in your dreams
You know and I know what you want for
If it ain't clear to ya baby
Don't stop, let's rock

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Gimme gimme
Gimme some Gimme some
Ain't like you don't want none
Yea yea yea yea yea

Don't fight what you can't son

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Four letter words and three wishes
Is what I came for
Love birds blowin' kisses in picture frame form
With just a faction of this major attraction, comming soon
I bust and implode, gimme gimme room
I keep blazin', it's so amazin'
The occasion that I am raisin', massive body invasion
So what you sayin' all that love for
Open up your mind, explore, and make it hard core
I'll be your candy store
Give you just a little more than what you bargained for
And if you ask me for some guidance, it's not a minus
I'll break it down to a science, kitchen appliance
69 gimme mine, I'll be your valentine
365 days I want my sun to shine
See, I've been waiting for the planets to realign
Total eclipse on my lips until the end of time

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Gimme gimme
Gimme some Gomme some
Ain't like you don't want none
Yea yea yea yea yea
What you gonna do
Gimme gimme
Gimme some gimme some
Don't fight what you can't son
Yea yea yea yea yea
What you gonna do
