[Verse 1]
How long do I let this thing go on?
Before I run away
Not begging you to stay
But I'd like it if you could
And you're knowing that you should
Be down with the one that's going to love you baby
Suspense is driving me crazy

[Chorus]
What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us? (what's up with us)
What's up?
What's up with you and me? (oh yeah baby)
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?

[Verse 2]
See I'm not trying to peer pressure you
If it's something you don't wanna do
But I've got to let you know
You're position must be known
There ain't no reason to front
But I guess I will be blind and just let you know that
I'm walking out the door

Unless you tell me right now
What you gonna to do with my love?
Oh baby, what's up?

[Chorus]
What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?

What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?

I don't know why but I've always tried
Why don't you make up, why don't you make up your mind?
What's up with us baby? (what's up baby?)
What's up with us baby? (what's up baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh)

[Rap: Left Eye]
Don't be afraid and don't you fade on my escapade
Fantasy lives within the dreams that we have made
Calling me up, 6 in the mornin' , the break of dawn'in
Before I could imagine that you'd be gone and
I think about the times we shared, call it do or dare
Ask me if I'm being fair, do you really care?
See me and you like a holiday
Never too late to celebrate in a lot of ways

(What's up?)
We really don't need to play these guessing games no more
No, no, no
(What's up)
I gave you all my love you said it was too much you don't want no more
(What's up?)
We really didn't need to play these guessing games no more
No, no, no, no, no
(What's up)
I gave you all my love and you said it was too much you don't want no more

[Chorus]
What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?

What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?

What's up?

What's up?
What's up with you and me?
Baby I wanna know
What's up with us?
