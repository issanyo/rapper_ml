[Radio Feedback/Instrumental]
When we first started out, we were overconfident
I mean, I don't know, I guess it means that umm
Man bump that
I mean back then, only we can compare ourselves is to being bigger than BBD
We were like so large, we were big like BBD!
We gon' sell this many records, we gon' sell that many records
Talkin' much junk I don't care who said
But what if y'all don't sell it
What you mean what if we don't sell it?
We like what?
And then when it happened, we knew it would happen
And as much junk as we talked
We didn't know it was just a lot of death talk
My dream is to just keep going forward, and never look backwards
