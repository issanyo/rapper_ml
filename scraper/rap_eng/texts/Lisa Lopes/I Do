[Natina]
Ha, ha, ooh
Can't nobody tell me what I can
Cause I be loving my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can
What? What?
Huh, huh, ha
Can't nobody tell me what I can
Cause I be loving my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can
What? What?
Huh, huh yeah

[Verse 1]
Can't nobody ever say I don't love my man
Who are you to justify what I can and can't
(Can't and can't and how I can, ooh)
Gonna make him love me even more
(Loving me even, loving me even more)
I've been giving him more love than I did before

[Hook]
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs

[Bridge]
And I do
Give him the love that no girl in this world
Could ever touch
And I do
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

[Verse 2]
Won't nobody ever share the fun we have?
(Da, da, da, da, da)
Who are you to manipulate the trust in my man?
(Can't nobody touch the trust in my man)
I'm gonna show the world what we're made of
(Show the world what we're made of)
Wrapped in his arms, he can't get enough
Oh suckee, suckee now

And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs

And I do
Give him the love that no girl in this world
Could ever touch
And I do
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

[Natina]
You ain't never heard a cop like that
Be tryin to be herb me out of my relation nonstop
Time to get the pop pops
Would you wanna hit me with
I'm like the driest curls you ever drip drop
Possibly lads things don't be givin' a cuff
When you think that you love your man
That's when he taps you on your shoulder
And he says baby you ain't givin' me love (what)

[Left Eye]
You ain't never heard the nine degrees
They my degrees on loving as philosophies
Unity the cornerstone that forms the one
Two ways of trust, either all or none
Joy, honor, respect and form the three laws that hurdle the four walls
That define the first five of all
Harmony number six takes commitment
Seven's love and is peace, makes confidence
Balance like a figure eight joined at the hip infinity
Ninth reign, never-ending trip
Don't just, focus, on what your eyes can see
Think, feel, believe, give and receive

Give him the love that he wants
Give him the love that he needs
Give him the love that he needs

Repeat Chorus Until Fade...

And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
