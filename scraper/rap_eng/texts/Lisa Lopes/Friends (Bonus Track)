This one right here
Goes out to everybody
And it doesn't matter who you are
Cuz I know that everybody
Has a friend (friend)

What defines a friend
The meaning where does it lie?
In the mind
In the money
In the face
In in the eyes
In the days and the nights
Well what is a friend
Do you love it and leave it
Again and again?
Now our story begins
Of two little friends
You would've thought they were twins
Would've thought they was kin
Wouldn't think they could manage
All the time they would spend
For each other they'd fend
For their friends till the end
And their mothers know mothers
Sisters know brothers
Mothers know fathers
Sons know their daughters
Blood thicker than water
If one had 50 cents
They'd both have a quarter
It only makes sense
That destined love was in order
They grew up together
From pre-K to high school
Winters in the snow
Summers in the pool
He's an athlete
She's an actress
But hormones would lead them to the mattress

I thought you were my friend (friend)
Together through thick and thin (friend)
Like it we were
All the things that we've been through
I put so much trust in you
Back then (friend)
Now what kind of friend
Could you have been

Not furious just curious
She saw himself fit
Who better than a boy
The girl grew up with
How 'bout all the walks in the park
On the phone all night
Dreams like that she saw in plain sight
To his friends he's urgin'
The simple fact she's a virgin
To her he'll be urgin'
Sexually lets merge
As you can see
There's two different dreams
Her thoughts are so pure
His low as the floor
She's lookin'
He's gawkin'
They're walkin' and talkin'
About a new stage and phase
That they should embark in
So it came to that night
No dinner no candlelight
The female exhales
Somethin' doesn't feel right
She said it polite
Honey please not tonight
He didn't get in it
So he got real malignant
He hit her
It hurt
Her breath got suspended
Then he looked at his work
Not feelin' so splendid

Their meeting had ended
Feelin' offended
He went and attended
A counselin' session
Now life is a lesson
Full of questions
Why we drown down
Rather than manifestin'
Went to his friend
Right from the beginnin'
With tears in his eyes
Said I apologize
She much obliged
Made amends
Once again
They're friends to the end
Yeah it was true love again
As transparent as lens
As apparent as kin
What defines a friend
Where does it lie
In the mind
In the money
In the face
In the eyes
In the days and the nights
What is a friend
Do you love and leave it
Again and again
In the time
In the sadness
In the hurt
In the pride
It's the person dispersin'
Through the hands of time

Oh
Oh oh
I thought you were my friend
What kind of friend?
What kind of friend?
