[Intro: Lil Mama (Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes)]
When you hear Left Eye, when you hear Lil' Mama
(Shake it down now)
You know it's time to get busy so it ain't really too much to talk about
(Yeah, shake it down now)
(Uh-huh, yeah-yeah-yeah, shake it down now)
How was it working with her? It was an honor

[Verse 1: Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]
Remember way back in the day (hey, hey)
When the kids from around the way
Used to come out and play
And the double dutch bus
Had you bumpin' on down the street
Tryin' to move your feet
While you shake your little booty
To the groovy beat (uh)
To the beat, to the beat (beat)
You hit the corner and you stopped
"Hey y'all there's a party on the other block!"
We hit the jackpot, jackpot (what, what)
And it's only 12 o'clock
And the sun is hot
Free soda pop
We gonna to rock, rock, rock, rock...

[Chorus: Clyde McKnight]
Everybody unload
It's about time that we had a good time
So pu-put on your clothes
And meet me right back down the stairs
We BBQin',  playin' music
Double-dutch and hoola-hoopin'
Call everybody you know
And celebrate, we're 'bout to have a
Block party, a block party, ooh-hoo
Block party, a block party (ooh-hoo, yeah)
Come on everybody!
Block party, a block party (ooh-hoo, yeah)
Block party, a block party
Come on everybody!

[Interlude I]
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music pumping and we're jumping
And they're playing our favorite songs
We were dancing all night long
We were dancing all night long
Music pumping and we're jumping
And they're playing our favorite songs

[Verse II: Lil' Mama]
Uh, the electric
Even the people 'cross seas gotta respect this
Hear ya check this, what been around, ow
Pop up, like I'm aroun' now
I know you like my style
Burgers on the grill flip up and down
Girls rock jeans that's fitting now
The boys on the block that like your smile
He ain't gotta act like that
He be likin' my style more than he like my bag
He. Ain't. Got. To
Act. Like. That. He
Like my style more than he likes my bag
In fact, my party hoppin'
Best believe we keep the whole block rockin'

[Chorus]

[Interlude II: Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes]
I'm a big-city girl
From all over the world
And I do what I wanna do
Right foot, left shoe
Then you take it on down
Then you shake it around
Bring it up, clap your hands
Then you turn it all around again

[Lil' Mama]
Y'all ain't gotta this, y'all ain't gotta that
When it come to tracks, y'all ain't gotta ask
I'm shellac like flow on wax
And I spi-di-di-di-dit that flow on wax
Like that, in the middle of the block party
Watch the way I just rock baby
Roll, control
I think it's better when you rock baby
If not, you might look like a player
If you ain't a player, Babygirl, you's a hater
Haters get no respect
And I disrespect any hate on that
I am check, talk about cash
Anything else, I'on talk about that
I don't rock hers, no, I don't rock that
Nope, I am constant infinite cash flow
(So let's go)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Clyde McKnight]
Block party, a block party (ooh-hoo, yeah)
Block party, a block party
Come on everybody!
Block party, a block party (ooh-hoo, yeah)
Block party, a block party
Come on everybody!
