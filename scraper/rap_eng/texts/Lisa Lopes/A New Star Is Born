I believe when someone passes away
Either a star is born, energy so pure
That it creates new worlds
Or as the soul releases
Shatters into pieces
Becoming free flowing thoughts
For my mental thesis
Maybe we just don't understand
The spirits that still walk the land
Or whatever the case
I believe that we all still remain
To share the same space

So dad, I know you're listenin'
How you been?
Oh, I'm doin' fine, just passin' time
Submerged in sin sometimes I take a bath
And just get all dirty again
I try to cleanse my mind, cleanse my soul and get in
Into that place you've been
No, I'm not tryin' to rush anything
I just wanna visit you because I miss you
So what you tryin' to say?
My imagination been wild since I been a child
And since you're laughin' then
I take it that good things are happenin'

The day I learned you were gone
A new star was born
Distant voices fill my mind
Said look up in the sky
And when I did there you were

Well, I'm sure you already know this
I'm a big pop star
And my pops is a star (ha ha)
No, you really are
Sometimes I feel like an anus
I kinda made you a little famous
Always spillin' my guts
Explainin' to these people who think I'm nuts
Told them how you and moms knuckled up
My excuse for being such a disrupt
Yeah, they sure did
They called you an abusive drunk
Sorry, I didn't realize the media would run with it
But now I know and sometimes I try to have fun with it

The day I learned you were gone
A new star was born
Distant voices fill my mind
Said look up in the sky
And when I did there you were

What did you say you wish to be free
Been here all this time because of me
And on August 16, 2001
Anything that I wish to release
Release? I see
First of all I give you my thanks for preparing me
To be open and free
I release my mind releasin' my soul
Release the courage to break the mold
Release my record 20 million sold
Release my pops you're free to go
Create a new galaxy, yes dad
You'll still be right next to me

The day I learned you were gone
A new star was born
Distant voices fill my mind
Said look up in the sky
And when I did there you were

The day I learned you were gone
A new star was born
Distant voices fill my mind
Said look up in the sky
And when I did there you were
