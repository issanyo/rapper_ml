What up yo, word to the badd

I gave my love
You gave your love
Thought we'd never part
Said you love me
Then you left me
With a broken heart
You never think about who you love
You only think about number one
You forgot about where we started from
You only think about what you want
I don't care about how it's done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong

[Chorus:]
It ain't about your world
It ain't about the things that you do
If you don't care, I don't care
Cause you keep thinkin' 'bout you
It ain't about you takin' my pie
You been takin' for a long time
If you don't care, I don't care
If you keep
Well I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

What up yo, word to the badd

Once you were made
You changed your ways
Even told me lies
Could not trust you
Still I loved you
My mind worried overtime
You know I tried to be there for you
Like a lover I cared for you
It didn't matter you always play me off
You only care about what you want
You don't care about how it's done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong

[Chorus]
It ain't about your world
It ain't about the things that you do
If you don't care, I don't care
Cause you keep thinkin' 'bout you
It ain't about you takin' my pie
You been takin' for a long time
If you don't care, I don't care
If you keep
Well I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Oh no no, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Oh no
What's up yo, word to the badd

Thinkin' about that pie that you've been takin' from me
From a love to another lover hard to believe
Lost and don't know it yet you still show it
Givin' seems to be harder than it is to receive
The glass has gotten shady when it should have been clearer
But it's you always starin' in the mirror
Constatnly fakin' it ain't no mistakin' it
Get a grip cause you're not far from breakin' it

Thinkin' about the time when we used to be close
It shouldn't be past tense cause nobody knows
What the futurem ay hold what tomorrow might bring
It' not guaranteed that you'll be spreadin' your wings
And funny it seem show it used to be
Times when you needed to lean on me
Now you're standin' on two and you wanna act now
Girl I ain't thinkin' about you
