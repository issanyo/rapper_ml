[Intro]
Make the night swing
Make the night swing

[Verse 1: Left Eye]
I see you
Watchin’ me
From inside
Your TV
Empty space
Can’t erase
Wishful thoughts
Silent dreams
When your eyes
Visualize
What your heart
Can’t control
Use your mind
Take your time
Grab my body
Wit’ your soul

[Bridge: Chilli]
It’s your world (it’s your world)
If you want I’m your girl
If you know what it takes
To get on (then get on)

[T-Boz]
Ain’t nobody your hoe
(Ain’t nobody your hoe tonight!)
Ain’t nobody your bitch
(Ain’t nobody your BE-OTCH!)
Well if you treat me right
We’ll spend some time
Maybe we can swing tonight

[Chorus]
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing

[Verse 2: Left Eye]
Baby I
Know you try
And you’re givin’ me the sky
But I thirst
The universe
Maybe then we could fly
What I am is a girl
An emotional pearl
Keep your wealth
To yourself
If you can’t share your world

[Bridge: Chilli]
It’s your world (it’s your world)
If you want I’m your girl
If you know what it takes
To get on (then get on)

[T-Boz]
Ain’t nobody your hoe
(Ain’t nobody your hoe tonight!)
Ain’t nobody your bitch
(Ain’t nobody your BE-OTCH!)
Well if you treat me right
We’ll spend some time
Maybe we can swing tonight

[Chorus]
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing


[Verse 3: Left Eye]
C’mon!
I might be ready for the rockin’ if you’re steady
Now Betty Boop would do the Shoop
For a reason that is petty
See my spaghetti ain’t greasy
You’re cravin’ for the sleezy
I suggest you digest an egg that’s over easy
My Chick-Fil-A has come a long damn way
For a two piece nugget tryin’ dig before I dug it
And as the dead once said “as a horse had remorse”
And of course he was thinkin’ with the wrong head
But back to the subject of the matter
Cuz if a bitch is who you’re pitchin’ to
Then who’s the fuckin’ batter?
My heart will never pitter patter
For the disrespectful dialect
You’ll see me as the lady climbin’ up the ladder
I don’t expect a broken neck in knowin’ how to act
But the Left can detect if you’re not givin’ back
Then as a matter of fact in tryin’ to see you through
I may get caught up in the game
That I am serving you

[Chorus (2x)]
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing
If I get caught in your world
Maybe we can do that thing
Make the night swing


[Repeating Chorus/T-Boz Outro]
