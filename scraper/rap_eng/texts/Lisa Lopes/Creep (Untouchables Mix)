Yeah, TLC, Untouchables, Eddy F. Kenny Low

(CHORUS)
So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

(verse 1)
The 22nd of loneliness and we've
Been through so many things
I love my man with all honesty
But I know he's cheatin' on me
I look him in his eyes but all he
Tells me is lies to keep me near
I'll never leave him down though
I might mess around it's only
'Cause I need some affection oh

(CHORUS)
So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

(verse 2)
The 23rd of lonliness
And we don't talk like we use to do
Now it seems pretty strange
But I'm not buggin' 'cause I still feel
The same yeah, yeah
I'll keep giving loving until the day he pushes me away
Never go astray
If he knew the things I did
He couldn't handle it
And I choose to keep him protected oh

(CHORUS)
So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

I think about us baby all the time
But you know that I'm gonna need some attention
Yeah, yeah can you dig it (So I creep)
Love you forever baby soul & mind
And you gotta know it
You don't give it Imma
Get mine

(Left eye's rap)
Oh I Oh I Oh I am the surgeon general
I do believe in lyrical miracles (Warning!)
Creepin' may cause hysterical behavior in the mind
Put your life into a bind
And in time make you victim to a passionate crime
Now pregnant women put themselves at greater risk of bein' dissed
Known as no one for not knowin' who the daddy is
Which may result in little kids growin' up by the dozens
Gettin' sexually involved with first cousins
Creepin' is the number one item on the chart
Rippin' families apart the leadin' cause of a broken heart
Injuries can be fatal may in fact of prenatal
HIV is often sleepin' in a creepin' cradle

(Chorus)
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep
So I creep yeah I
Just keep it on the down low
Said nobody is supposed to know
So I creep yeah
'Cause he doesn't know what I do
And no attention
Goes to show oh so I creep

(T-boz outro)
Shake it down, shake it down now
Shake it down, shake it down now
Shake it down, shake it down now
