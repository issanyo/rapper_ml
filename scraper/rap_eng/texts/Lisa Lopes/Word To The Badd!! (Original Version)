[T-Boz]
What up yo
Word to the badd!

[Verse 1]
Reconstructed
Been abducted
Don’t know who you are
Think they love you
They don’t know you
Lonely superstar

[Pre-Chorus]
Never think about who you love
Only think about number one
You forget about where you started from
You only think about what you want
Don’t care about how it’s done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or be it wrong

[Chorus]
It ain’t about your world
It ain’t about the things that you do
If you don’t care, I don’t care
Cause you keep thinkin’ ’bout you
It ain’t about you takin’ my pie
You been takin’ for a long time
If you don’t care, I don’t care
If you keep
Well I ain’t thinkin’ ’bout you

What up yo, word to the badd

[Verse 2]
Once you were made
You changed your shade
Was your color wrong?
Could not turn back
It’s a known fact
You were too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I tried to be there for you
Like a brother I care for you
It didn’t matter you always play me off
You only care about what you want
You don’t care about how it’s done
You only think about you, your throne
Be it right or wrong

[Chorus]

Oh no no, I ain’t thinkin’ ’bout you
Oh no

What up yo, word to the badd

[Rap]
Thinkin’ about that pie that you’ve been takin’ from me
From a brother to another brother hard to believe
Lost and don’t know it yet you still show it
Givin’ seems to be harder than it is to receive
The glass has gotten shady, time to make it clearer
Clean it up and lets start with the Man in the mirror
Theres sadness there brother, ain't no mistaken it
Get a grip cause youre not far from breakin it
Thinkin about the time when we used to be close
It shouldn't be past tense, cause nobody knows
What the future may hold, what tomorrow might bring
Its not guaranteed that youll be spreading your wings
But meanwhile, I continue to smile, cause in the back of my head
I know you’re still a child
You say that your a man, but that will never be
Unless the day comes when you can lean on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Gone too far, you better turn back
I know who you are
You know where I'm at
Sad but its true, from me to you
Don't be alone
Step off your throne
Come back home

[Chorus x3]
