Ladies and Gentlemen!
Yes my fine gentlemen friends
Okay, we're gonna turn to the chapter in Eyenetics
Called Left Pimping
Everybody turn to Left Pimping
Now as you can see
It's located in a region near your man
Called untitled space

I'm T-Boz I got it like that
Left Eye's dope she's got it like that
Chilli's fly she's got it like that
TLC and that's where it's at
I'm T-Boz I got it like that
Left Eye's dope she's got it like that
Chilli's fly she's got it like that
TLC and that's where it's at

We met at the park at the Summer Jams
Tims untied with saggy pants
Not the kind of guy I would give a chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
6 foot 3 sexy as can be
I saw him through the crowd comin' up to me
He said aren't you that shorty from TLC
He told me 'bout the things he would do to me

[Bridge]
(So come on over)
Let me check you out
See just what you're talkin' 'bout
(So come on over)
Boy you turn me on
Talkin' that stuff on the telephone
(So come on over)
You got me so enthused
So I can't wait to get next to you
(So come on over)
Don't let it take too long
I'm ready to put it on

You need some ginseng
For your ping ping
So we can do it!
Oops

[Hook]
First it came
And then he went
Right to sleep on me
I could not believe
Wake it up and give me what I need
Yeah yeah
First it came
And then he went
Right to sleep so fast
Did he have it up his sleeve
To pull a quickie on me

He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he did not
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
Yeah yeah

He called me up to apologize
Said he owed me one and tonight's the night
Didn't know if he should get another chance
But he was kinda packin' under circumstance
He didn't know that I peeped him out
Picked up on what a quickie is all about
So went to dinner back to the crib
So I could switch it up and show him how it is

[Bridge]

Oh wait hold up hold up hold up
Is your name Houdickie
Cuz I heard you pulled a quickie

[Hook]

He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he did not
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
He pulled a quickie on me
No no no no no he didn't
Yeah yeah

Now as we bring this class to a close
There is one last thing that we must review everybody
Alright, it's called the Left Pimp Dance
Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna put your left foot in front
Leeeeeean to the left and.....

Just like sweet rivers
I got a tasteful flow
My ears and neck shivers
With this icy snow
Head soulfully quiver
Cuz the rhythm knows
How to correlate
With necks to vertebrae's glow
I murder days though
Meanin' I kill time
You heard of Mayo
Well my cars do real fine
Miracle Whip this lyrical chick
On some spiritual shit
This will be a perennial trip
Damn (damn)
I'm that imperial bitch (uh)

And I'm not doin' it with him anymore
