Yo whad up do
Hit a Q.U.E.S.T.I.O.N
Oh about da wo
The war?
But I'm sayin’ yo
D-Damian Dame
What is goin' on
Because this squabbling is
Just insane

What's goin’ on as a brother used to say
Kinda makes you think about back in that day
Peace was the word or haven't you heard
All this hype about war is absurd
What's goin' around comes around
Vietnam relived
Yeah
It's the same old sound
Missiles gliding, families dividing
The American Dream
Is quickly declining
Depression, oppression, I thought we learned a lesson
From the last time
Nobody wants to stand in the cheese and bread line
Recycled generations of love and war
And the question of what!
What are we fighting for?
Killin' for oil 'cause one spoiled with luxury
They gotta have it
So Saddam got rushed G
It got crazy and civilians were hit, ya see
A thud, a scud, all for what
It's time to begin the end
Somebody give it up
Sixty seconds turn off the news
’Cause every channel
Who shot who
Ain’t no glory
'Cause in the end, it will all be his-story
So we might as well stop!
