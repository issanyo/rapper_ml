See it was one of them days (yeah)
Like wakin' up in the stormy weather in your mind thinkin'
Ooohh, this could be so much better (I'm tellin' y'all)
I'll never forget her
Black leather down for whatever
My nigga's sweatin' me
So we sittin' in this club
Where the ladies rub-a-dub
They solicitin' their love
Me and my man about as tight as you can get it
So he admitted that he wanted to hit it
I said now wait a minute, I can contest
To bein' 'bout as open-minded as it gets
When it comes to sex
Cause I believe in time and space and what a waste
If you can't really have your time and space
So what was the use?
But to swallow my pride to love and let loose of this feelin' inside
Said if you want it that bad then you should have it
And then he smiled and said I want you to grab it

True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only

I'm on the hunt to get my nigga what he wants
From back to front of the club
She's tryin' to pull a stunt
Even though they got the lights down low
I can see the whole dance floor
She must have slipped out the back door
Rather than goin' back empty handed
I know this ain't the way he planned it
I do as if commanded
Hmm let's see who next be the finest
Who next be the best for sex
And messin' with his Highness
So I took another look and guess who's back
I'm off the hook
It's the lady in black
Excuse me Miss, see that man sittin' at the table
He wants to know
If you're ready willin' and able
So she followed me and obviously
My man is gonna want a little privacy but I was wrong
He turned it up another notch
Asked if she went tongue to crotch
And said he wants to watch

True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only

So now I'm thinkin' what have I done and gotten' into?
Maybe this will be strong and maybe monumental
As I look in her eyes what is she gonna say?
Never thought I'd be in dismay when I woke up today
She said her thing ain't girls we in three different worlds
So he mentioned instead that he wanted some head
She obliged no menage then fled
We were straight for 'bout a month
Until pure lust were the topics we discussed
Though I didn't mind he wants it all the time
More women and all I've been in
Spreadin' venom and still wanna be mine
So I told him one day can't do it any more
He reacts so relaxed
Said he's done with them for sure
Then I caught him one weekend
Cheatin' and creepin' duct's leakin' don't speak
I'll be leavin'

True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
True confessions of a broken heart
I learned my lesson now I'm torn apart
Everybody's got a story
About how they lost their one and only
