[Intro]
Oh yeah  This is for the open minded (ah ha) Yeah

[N.I.N.A.]
Now Now what do you believe Who do you receive Where do you go next And through what exit do you leave The questions that I believe Confessions so take heed  Count your many lessons And blessings that they bring This is for my breed And all life that is conceived Energy told me You manifest your destiny What is energy It's what you eat It's what you breathe It's what you think It permeates throughout your being And serves a link To all other energies That's anything and everything Moving light like you have never seen And light carries information Without hesitation vibrations glean Through the constellation  Manifestation stimulated For better destination Total creation realizations And mental concentration Alienated from the truth Is why we're conversatin' Savin' the nation for the youth Is for my observation

Chorus: [Esthero]
Are you free Or are you guided Do you make your own decisions Our only responsibility is love (love)

[Crooked I]
Yay though I walk through the Valley of Death Through the alleys of Cali I step I grab me a Tek and keep it gangsta  It's biblical to walk with a ride I'm often talkin' to God The boss of the squad Heavenly father Protect me when I'm in my Chevy Impala Goin' hard on the grind to collect me a dolla Holla Cuz I think slugs finna be released Cuz thugs envy me and that's the enemy of peace I need to find an invention for my momma's second born Redirect effortless than the seconds don't know where the form can touch me The universal search I've been through ten boosh ma's Synagogue's I sat in a church Even read ancient scriptures That came with Michelangelo's famous painted pictures A dangerous mixture of lies  So I'ma just be OG And search for the truth y'all That's on G-O-D So real (so real)

Chorus

Chorus

[N.I.N.A.]
You see We like to make things Complicated You don't have to read books And go to church To learn about God And find answers We don't even have to talk to each other You know  If we all just Be quiet Then we'll realize that we can really hear each other And then you'll realize That you already have the answers (a ha ha)

Chorus

[N.I.N.A.]
Lets touch on Christianity I question all humanity Is God so full of vanity That children enter this family Who haven't yet to see That Jesus is the key Will suffer this calamity (I cast you down for an eternity Insanity) You can call me what you want to But the man and me Separated from this false reality Would never be the victim of casualty For my lack of understanding Physicality Spirituality Hath immortality No matter your status Or nationality What's your locality Notice the fallacy We all separated By principalities Billions of galaxies And all you see is this In the totality Of eternal bliss A life of sin (yeah) It's all we get

[Esthero]
Do you make Make your own Cuz you're all On your own  Do you all Make your own Cuz you're all On your own  Do you make Make your own Cuz you're all On your own  Do you all Make your own Cuz you're all On your own
