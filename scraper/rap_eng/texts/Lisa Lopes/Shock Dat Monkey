Yo dis is TLC
Yeah and we're back to school da girlies
And if n ya know dat yo man is startin' to flip
Shock dat monkey on the TLC Tip
Y'all know we ain't down for no monkey business
Erri uuhh erri uuhh erri
It ain't even like that
Yo T-Boz kick it

When you know that it's good
And you know that it's hot
All the girlies want a piece of what you've got
When a man is a man
And it's all in his face
He's 'gon jump all on it
Cause it be's that way
Gotta get up on it
Put that heart aside
Ain't about that lovin'
It's all about that pride
If you do unto him
What he does all the time
That's the only thing for sure
To keep that nickel in line
You gotta go

[Chorus]
Shock dat monkey
Shock 'em good shock 'em good
Shock dat monkey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Shock dat monkey
Shock 'em good, shock 'em good
Shock dat monkey

If he plays in the field
And he's shamin' your name
Got no time for tears
You can get in the game
If a man is a man
And he calls you a ho
Ain't no point in playin'
If he doesn't know (yeah)
Don't let him know
If you don't go through it
And if it blows
Hey just don't sweat it
Now you're in control
If you just don't screw it
Shock him before
He knows you know so

[Chorus]

Yo you wanna know somethin' I'm in a situation
Like it or not it's you, your own creation
Lendin' a leg cause you ain't too proud to beg
For a quick sensation invitation
And bein' that I am the kinda girl that I am
Lend a hand and dare you to give a damn
Cause his story can be my story too
Ooohhh monkey see monkey do
When you know that it's good
And you know that it's hot
All the girlies want a piece of what you've got
When a man is a man
And it's all in his face
He's 'gon jump all on it
Cause it be's that way (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Break]
Yo it ain't cool and as a matter of fact
Get the monkey up off your back
And when he wanna know where you're at
Get the monkey up off your back
Even if he don't like it like dat
Get the monkey up off your back
You gotta do it to keep 'em intact
Get that monkey up offa your back

[Chorus]

Gotta get up on
Put that heart aside
It ain't about that lovin'
It's all about that pride
If you do unto him
What he does all the time
That's the only thing for sure
To keep that nickel in line
Hey

[Break]

[Chorus]
