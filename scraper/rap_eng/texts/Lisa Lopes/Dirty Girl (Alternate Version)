[Intro]
Yeah I see her

[Verse 1]
I'm a clean girl
And I ain't tryna glorify myself
But I ain't tryna lose to someone else
The loneliness I already felt
Cause of some dirty girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, so flirty
Ooh, ooh, ooh, huggin' every thug
Ooh, ooh, ohh, watch her shake it up
Ooh, ooh, ohh, she's so dirty

[Chorus]
Bet you know that bitch over there
(yeah I seen her look)
I know you know that bitch over there
That's alright with me
She got nothing over me
And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothing for free
Dirty girl please
Tryna ride
But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially since she's a...
Dirty girl (3x)

[Verse 2]
I'm a clean girl
Not tryna say that I don't do these things
For these things there is a time and place
What's the challenge if there is no chase
Answer...a dirty girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh so dirty
Ooh, ooh, ooh see her in the club
Ooh, ooh, ooh how you lick it up
She so dirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
So flirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
Huggin' every thug, ooh, ooh, ooh
Watch her shake it up
She's so dirty

[Chorus]
Bet you know that bitch over there
(yeah I seen her look)
I know you know that bitch over there
That's alright with me
She got nothing over me
And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothing for free
Dirty girl please
Tryna ride
But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially since she's a...
Dirty girl (3x)

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Let me break it down
D, dogged out
Didn't mean to be a dirty girl
Did you now?
Doop-de-doop
Don't know who
Be the I
I be inside of you
It'd be a better day
When you all realize who you really are
Really are a star
S-T-A-R (she's so dirty)
T, tell 'em T
Tell 'em what the truth be like
Uh, yeah, tell 'em that they shinin' bright
Now, why, why they wanna dim the light?
Why (3x)
G, girls gotta get it together
I, I know it can get better
R, are you ready to recity
L, love from Latrelle and Left Eye

[Chorus]
Bet you know that bitch over there
(yeah I seen her look)
I know you know that bitch over there
That's alright with me
She got nothing over me
And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothing for free
Dirty girl please
Tryna ride
But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially since she's a...
Dirty girl (3x)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh so dirty
Ooh, ooh, ooh see her in the club
Ooh, ooh, ooh how you lick it up
She so dirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
So flirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
Huggin' every thug, ooh, ooh, ooh
Watch her shake it up

[Outro]

She's so dirty
