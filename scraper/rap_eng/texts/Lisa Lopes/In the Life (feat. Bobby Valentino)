Intro: (4x)
From Rags to Riches (riches)
Bet you I?mma be the richest

Verse1:
I started off as an army brat (Atten-hut!)
Seven months, class act
I was racin? down the block
As a matter of fact
I could've been a track star (I guess I am)
I stacked bars
Comin' through your system in them phat cars (uh)
Cross country isn't that far
It's like I'm in the race, don't know who you cats are
See one day I fell from grace, landed in this place
My whole sh*t erased from talkin' back to my momma's face
Like I was lost in space
Without a trace, cuttin' class, bein' Mrs. Fast Ass
Gettin' blasted with dad, got caught up in the flash
My Nana goin' mad, had to make the dash
Saw a fell up in the streets
Did anything for cash
And anything to crash, in anybody's path
Gave everything I had
Took what I could grab (check it)
It was just a bunch of open rags

Chorus (Bobby Valentino):
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin? a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
I?ll tell you how I came from Rags to Riches

Verse2:
I remember sellin' coke
Can't believe that I was poisonin' my folk
Now I let my throat be the antidote
Always kept my hopes high
Now mama don't cry, 'cause I'll be close by
With the most high
I was playin' Robin Hood (in the hood)
Little Red Riding Hood
Til' the barrel pointed where I stood (yeah, I stood)
But walked away like I was absolutely positively sure I could

Attitude on f*ck it
Some dollars in the bucket
Been scheming steady dreaming
For a chance to make some duckets
Caused a little ruckus on the sideline
Fully reconstructed every guideline
From the alley way to Cali, on the Grammy day
Went from disarray to mayday, mayday, mayday
Ran away from the sickness with a quickness
And went from rags to richness

Chorus (Bobby Valentino):
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin? a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
I?ll tell you how I came from Rags to Riches

Verse 3 (Bobby Valentino):
Man, I struggled so long
Did whatever it took me for me to get on
I wouldn?t let nobody stop me
Even if they told me I can?t
I said I?mma do it, watch me
And now I?m just living life lavish
Money, cars, and clothes
Yea I got to have it
It?s been a long hard road to make it
In this business
But I told y?all I?ll be the bestest

Chorus (Bobby Valentino)(2x):
This is the story in the life of a hustler
Running for the come up
No one ever thought I would ever blow up
So I guess I had to show up
Now everywhere I go
The people wanna know
They wanna know where I came from
Not havin? a pot to piss in
Stop and listen
I?ll tell you how I came from Rags to Riches
