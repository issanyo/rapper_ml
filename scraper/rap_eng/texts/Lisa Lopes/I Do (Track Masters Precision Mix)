Ha ha
Can't nobody tell me what I can
Cuz I be lovin' my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can (what what huh huh) ha
Can't nobody tell me what I can
Cuz I be lovin' my man ridiculously
Whether I should or shouldn't
Can't nobody tell me what I can (what what huh huh yeah)

Can't nobody ever say I don't love my man
Who are you to justify what I can and can't
I'll make him love me even more
I been givin' him more love than I did before

And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love
That no girl in this world
Could ever touch
And I do
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

Won't nobody ever share the bond we had
Who are you to manipulate the trust in my man
Gonna show the world what we're made of
Wrapped in his arms he can't get enough

And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that no girl in this world
Could ever touch
And I do
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

You ain't never heard a cop like that
Be tryin' hurl me out of my relations nonstop
Time to get the po po's
What you wanna hit me with
I can make the driest curls drip drop
Possibly L-A-dies these days just don't be givin' a kuff
When you thinkin'
That you lovin' your man
It's when he tap you on your shoulder sayin'
Baby you ain't givin' me love (what)

I do
Give him the love that he wants
I, I, I, do
Give him the love that he needs
I, I, I, do
Give him the love that he wants
I, I, I do
Give him the love that he needs

And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
Give him the love that he needs
And I do
Give him the love that he wants
And I do
