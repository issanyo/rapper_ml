[Intro]
Dark Child, TLC, let's go

[Verse 1: T-Boz]
It seems like, when I'm with you
Only crazy broads, seem to find you
And I'm thinkin' like, how do they know you?
And just what are you into?
Cause I'm diggin' you, if everything is cool
But if you're playing games, was good to know you
Let me give you a clue, we could be stuck like glue
But I refuse to be a fool

[Bridge: Chilli]
I wanna get with you but it just seems so crazy
Are these girls necessary?
Why are they all up on you?
And why do you act like it's cute?
I'm not gonna be your boss, you can try and play me
It don't work that way, baby
So let me know who you choose
If I'm here waiting for you

[Chorus]
I don't like to play around
That's not how I get down
No foolishness allowed
Who's it gon' be?
I'm not stressing over you
So whatcha gonna do?
Keep playing you will lose
Who's it gon' be?

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
It doesn't feel right, when I'm with you
Having these broads, keep approaching you
If my thoughts are true, I will be with you
You will see just what I'll do
But if my thoughts are wrong, then what you say is true
I asked you to forgive, before accusing you
I pray I'll never see the day go
When  you decide those chicks should be with you

[Bridge]
I wanna get with you but it just seems so crazy
Are these girls necessary?
Why are they all up on you?
And why do you act like it's cute?
I'm not gonna be your boss, you can try and play me
It don't work that way, baby
So let me know who you choose
If I'm here waiting for you

[Chorus]
I don't like to play around
That's not how I get down
No foolishness allowed
Who's it gon' be?
I'm not stressing over you
So whatcha gonna do?
Keep playing you will lose
Who's it gon' be?

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
It's been a minute since I seen you
I've just been killin' time
Lettin' all these bitches know
That you will always be mine
Disappear then reappear
We held it down through the years
All the crazy shit we've been through
Can't take no more tears
Fell in love when I first met you
Put you all on my team
Introduced you to my crew
Told you my every dream
It was us against the world
Nobody could come between
Passionate, crazy shit
If you know what I mean (let's go)

[Chorus (2x)]
I don't like to play around
That's not how I get down
No foolishness allowed
Who's it gon' be?
I'm not stressing over you
So whatcha gonna do?
Keep playing you will lose
Who's it gon' be?

[Alternate Bridge (2x)]
Who's it gon' be?
Who's it gon' be?
Who's it gon' be?
TLC

[Chorus]
