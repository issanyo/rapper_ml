Verse 1:
Ya?ll never really know me from the stories I tell
From the lifestyle I lead and the records I sell
Caught up in situations detrimental to me
And I been through every war just for the world to see
(That time) is always moving situations do change
(And Things) don?t always work out just the way that we planned
(Still Stand) necessary be my friend and my foe
Either love me or you hate me, that?s how the game goes
(If it?s wrong) to be respected never ever say die
(Remain Strong) never neglected spread my wings and fly
(Like You) Ive been though struggles so much stress on my brain
Actin? out my life on stages and still had to maintain
(Question every decision) My intentions were good
Twist the story all around and leave me misunderstood
(Imagine That) No privacy but that?s the price of this fame
(Under attack) my destiny to be a soldier through fame

Chorus:
Let me live live
Let me live
In in side inside intelligence
Say say say say what you gotta say
Always asking you will amazed
Let me live live
Let me live
In in side inside intelligence
Say say say say what you gotta say
Always ask and you will amazed

Verse 2:
Just to make it in the world and go against all odds
Come from the gritty inner city to a superstar
Number one hits consistently for ten long years
Put my soul in every project my blood sweat and my tears
Ya?ll know my status
Left eye the badest
Underestimate don?t hate and I keep it lavish
But it don?t mean nothing If I cant find peace of mind
Packing all distractions away leave them behind
Say goodbye hard times small crimes and felonies
A new beginning im winning envisioning the breeze
I?m dressed in all white linen and falling to my knees

Thankful for all that?s been given, I?m living, with ease
Tropical trees 90 degrees, please
Do like the birds and the bees and start a family
So remise on every line that I wrote
Know that I never will surrender and its truth that I spoke

Chorus:
Let me live live
Let me live
In in side inside intelligence
Say say say say what you gotta say
Always asking you will amazed
Let me live live
Let me live
In in side inside intelligence
Say say say say what you gotta say
Always ask and you will amazed

I flew I flew like water like water
Am I desire like fire like fire
I?m picking up the dirt from the earth the earth
Imaging I?m the wind redelivering from people within
I flew I flew like water like water
Am I desire like fire like fire
I?m picking up the dirt from the earth the earth
Imaging I?m the wind redelivering from people within

Chorus:
