[Intro: Left Eye]
It was November on that cloudy day as I remember
Ten months into his life for a clock began that night
A strife she's on the panickin' tip
Get to the hospital quick
Jumped out the car 'fore it hit
She grabbed the baby and slipped to the ground
Saved the day thought everything was ok
To find him covered in blood
This is the story of love

[Chorus: Tangi]
Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

[Verse 1: Tangi]
There's an empty space in my heart
When things break down it's all because
Lonely days without you I have to figure out
Now wha' I'm gonna do
Don't mean to cry all the time
I know you're safe and sound
I don't think I could ever be satisfied again

[Chorus: Tangi]
Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

[Left Eye]
Whatever happened that day
That we lost baby jose
You gained a strength that no man
In this world could take away
And so I kicks this one for you
No tighter wish is true
It's not a day goes by that I don't think
Of little precious baby boo
And 'cause this moment is yours
I shed my tears through the years till no more
Behind these closed doors
And you can count on me
From now till forever
We be them birds of a feather
Flyin' together through the stormy weather
It don't begin till it ends
Sing it again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Chorus: Tangi]
Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

When people say to me (ay-o tangi)
I have a surprise for you
The first thing that comes in my mind (uh huh)
Is someone's 'bout to bring me you

[Left Eye]
Yo check it
I know sometimes you ask why
But don't cry just keep your head up high
'Cause in them heavenly skies (you know I'm tryin')
Awaits the sun yes the one
One to come with your eyes
Tangi's eyes (I'm tryin')
And no he holds no remorse (I'm tryin')
Just ask the source he'll amend like I said
It don't begin till it ends
So sing it again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

[Chorus: Tangi]
Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

Let me tell you what I know
Know I love you miss you so
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again
Dreaming you are here with me
Look the same from seein' you last
Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you again

Ain't no tighter wish in this world
Than to have you (baby)
Again
