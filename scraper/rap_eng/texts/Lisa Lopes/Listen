It's for the open minded

Verse 1:
Now
Now what do you believe?
Who do you receive?
Where do you go next?
And through what exit do you leave?
The questions that I believe confessions go to He
Count your many lessons and blessings that they bring
This is for my breed and all life that is conceived
Energy told me you manifest your destiny
What is energy?
It's what you eat
It's what you breathe
It's what you think
It permeates throughout your being
And serves a link to all other energies
That's anything and everything
Moving light that you have never seen
And light carries information
Without hesitation vibrations glean
Through the constellations, manifestation stimulated
Better destination, total creation realizations
And mental concentration
Alienated from the truth
Is why we conversated
Savin' the nation for the youth
Is for my observation

Chorus (2x)
It don't matter where you come from
If you're gone you like to run, run
Cause the past or the present
Here goes the future
What's your destiny?
I can make you (listen, listen)
Do you ever (listen, listen)
Past or the present
Here goes the future
What's your destiny?

Verse2:
Let's touch on Christianity
I question all humanity
Is God so full of vanity?
That children enter this family
Who haven't yet to see that Jesus is the key
Or suffer this calamity, I cast you down for an eternity

Insanity
You can call me what you want to
But the man in me
Separated from this false reality
Would never be the victim of casualty
For my lack of understanding there's a guarantee
Spirituality hath immortality
No matter your status or nationality
What's your locality notice the fallacy
We all separated by principalities
Billions of galaxies and all you see is this
In the totality of eternal bliss
A life of sin it's all the thin

Chorus (2x)
It don't matter where you come from
If you're gone you like to run, run
Cause the past or the present
Here goes the future
What's your destiny?
I can make you (listen, listen)
Do you ever (listen, listen)
Past or the present
Here goes the future
What's your destiny?

You see, we like to make things complicated
You don't have to read books and go to church
To learn about God
And find answers
We don't know how to talk to each other
You know if we all, shut up, be quiet
Then we'll realize that we can really hear each other
And then you'll realize that you already have the answers

Chorus (2x)
It don?t matter where you come from
If you?re gone you like to run, run
Cause the past or the present
Here goes the future
What?s your destiny?
I can make you (listen, listen)
Do you ever (listen, listen)
Past or the present
Here goes the future
What?s your destiny?
