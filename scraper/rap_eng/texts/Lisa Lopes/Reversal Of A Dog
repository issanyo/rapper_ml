Cadillac kinda class, she was the girl too fly
You know I had to check that name and number
Just like I did all the others
I turned them all out
She played right into everything I said
Took me out and then to bed
She'll be runnin' things instead
I never gave a second thought about it
Right then I knew she flipped it on me
She was reversal of a dog
How could she do that to me
She macked the hell out of me
It was the, it's the reversal of a dog
I must be totally blind
Completely out of my mind
It was the total reversal of a dog
Yo, I hope you're not thinkin' for just a minute
That he'll refuse to let me in
Then I will stand and you can't win
And we can go for a ride
But you told me hat to back
Before I was steadily comin' at
Let's take the trip the welcome to the first side
It's the reversal of a dog
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Bow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Bow wow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Bow wow, yippie yo, yippie yay
Saw my girl the next day
Tried to make my next play
But she was nonchalant about it
She knew I couldn't live without it
So she played me bad
That girl could walk and she could pull my chain
I would jump to anything
The dog in me was not the same
I never could tell what it was about her
Right then I knew she flipped it on me
She was reversal of a dog
How could she do that to me
She macked the hell out of me
It was the, it's the reversal of a dog
I must be totally blind
Completely out of my mind
It was the total reversal of a dog
Yo, I hope you're not thinkin' for just a minute
That he'll refuse to let me in
Then I will stand and you can't win
And we can go for a ride
But you told me hat two back
Before I was steadily comin' at
Let's take the trip the welcome to the first side
It's the reversal of a dog
Now take a look and try to see what you try to be
Well, there's a hook and let's agree that it's only me
Keepin' it frontin' but you couldn't, 'cuz you thought
You can't depart me somebody already taught me
It's a version of a dog, she turned out to be one
Come to think about it never though that I'd see one
My game was matched, my baby tried to play me
Gladys don't forget this stash you can't fade me
Would it be better if I screamed, "Sayonara"
Or would you think you're good and misbehave with your drama
You're plan is scandalous but I know how to handle this
After you I'm layin' low no joke
Saw him the next day tryin' to make his next play
But I was nonchalant about it
I knew he couldn't live without it
So I played him crazy
That girl could jog but she would pull my chain
I would jump to anything
The dog in me was not the same
I never could tell what it was about it
Right then I knew she flipped it on me
It was reversal of a dog
How could she do that to me
She macked the hell out of me
It was the, it's the reversal of a dog
I must be totally blind
Completely out of my mind
It was the total reversal of a dog
It's the reversal of a dog
Total reversal of a dog
I figured out your game
I put you to shame
So why can't you see
You're just a dog to me
Dog, total reversal of a dog
