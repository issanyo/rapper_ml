1 - 	I don't know what she would do
If she knew that you were comin'
To do what we do

I don't know what he would do
If he knew that you were comin'
To do what we do

[T-Boz]
Always wondered if she knew about us
When I met ya, you said ya'll had broken up
Right on time cause I didn't have my love
Me and him was on some other stuff
That let me fall to you
And from what I could tell, you fell too
And I wonder if it would be wrong
If we just kept it up

[Chilli]
2 - 	And I know we
Both had someone that we just left home
And they still think that they're the only ones
I like the way we hang, but it ain't below
When we know the feelings ain't all gone

Repeat 1

[T-Boz]
Always thought that he knew about you
When I met you, I said we were through
In time my feelings came right back
But I didn't let us get off track
And I got so into you
Way too fast, what do I do?
When I know I shoulda held it up
But you just turn me on

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

[Left Eye]
Yeah, come on, what, uh, LaFace, come on
We kept things pretty tight thus far
Love without the sex
And hundred thousand dollar cars
Ain't it funny how auras unify
An entity upon itself, that can spread wings and fly
A peaceful coexistence that will surely last
Becomes a reminiscent dream for those in our past
If they knew just a fraction of all the things we do
They still wouldn't comprehend
The depth between me and you

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

I don't know what
She would do if she knew
I don't know what
He would do if he knew
Don't know
Don't know
I don't know
Don't know
I....
