Uh, yea, come on
We gonna do this one right here (I like this)
Lets just do it
See when I wanna do something I just do what I feel, ya know what I'm saying?
I just do it straight from the heart, so we can do it and do it
Lets go

[Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes]
Nobody never understood be better
A true friend forever
That's why I'm writing you this love letter
Despite my ways through every phase
You brought me better days
Withstood the craze
From the beginning Windy hill the black Lennon
When I was saggin denim, and let you get up in em'
Until I damage when I select it
Another ni**a but we managed to stay connected
When you expected to see me naked
I couldn't let it five years and your still respected
Now check it, give me a second to unwind
You'll find all the pain and misery that nearly blew my mind
Can't no fame and shivery compare to losing time
I'll explain my history aboard the cools at nine
Don't be late, cuz I would hate to cross the seven seas
In the windy breeze, without your fantasies
Lets Do It

E-E-L-L-I-O-T-T, they call me Missy E, I'm C-U-T-E
You like the way I do it, I put my foot into it
Tell them haters that mad they can't do it like I do it
They used to call me fat, they used to say I'm ugly
But now im making records, groupies screaming that they love me
I got them dolla bills, I make a lot of cheese
Bet your bi**h can't do it like me
And when you see me in the club I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the street I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the town I'm lookin' fresh
I got my hair and my nails done and I'm so fresh
Baby, whatever you want to do, it's just so its up to you
Lets do what you want to do, Lets go

And if you think it's gonna take you higher

Anything that your mind can see
Lets Just Do It
And do it, and do it, and do it, and do it, and do it
