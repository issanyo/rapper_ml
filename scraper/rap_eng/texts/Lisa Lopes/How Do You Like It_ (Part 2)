[Verse 1: Keith Sweat]
I don't want to do you wrong, baby
I just want to treat you right, baby
Come and lay with me, my girl
I just want to serve you right

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Sweat & (Left Eye)]
How do you like it, baby
(Nice and slow, boy)
How you want it baby
(Here we go, my baby)
I wanna know what makes you feel good, my baby?
(Nice and slow, boy)
How do you like it, baby?
(Here we go, my baby)
I want my promises back

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
How do you like it
(Come on, come on, come on)
How do you like it
(Do you like it when I do it just like this to you, baby?)
How do you like it
(Tell me, how do you like it girl?)
How do you like it
And all the gangstas say
And all the gangstas say
And all the gangstas say
And all the gangstas say

[Verse 2: Keith Sweat]
Come on, girl, and taste this loving, girl
That you know I got for you
I just want to lay you down
That is what I want to do

[Pre-Chorus: Keith Sweat & (Left Eye)]
How do you like it, baby
(Nice and slow, boy)
How you want it baby
(Here we go, my baby)
I wanna know what makes you feel good, my baby?
(Nice and slow, boy)
How do you like it, baby?
(Here we go, my baby)
I want my promises back

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
Girl, I got to know
How do you like it when I do it just like this
(Ain't nothing but a jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like that
(Ain't nothing but a Keith Sweat jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like this
(Ain't nothing but a jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like that
(Ain't nothing but a Keith Sweat jam, babe)

[Interlude: Keith Sweat]
Yo here we go
Left Eye flow
Yeah, what's up

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Baby, you can skinny dip in my left lip, sip a little cat nip
Eat my punanna, monanna and the little banana split
Get a little top notch, play somebody's hopscotch
Watch, as I'm planning on landing on my man's crotch
Now there's a clue in pursuing what I'm doing
I wouldn't want to ruin you and who you knew
But as I'm rolling through your exes with my triple O's
I'm yelling tic-tac-toe from the waist below
Yo, you say tomah-toes, and I say tomatoes
So pick up on my lead and won't you lick up on those tetas
Me and my kitty cat is wearing a hat to the throne
So, baby, take us to the end zone
I'm catching 80 in my shady to the top nickel
I'm the lady going crazy on your Popsicle
And as we come a little closer to the end of the game
You know I'm taking all the sweat out your name

[Chorus: Keith Sweat]
Girl, I got to know
How do you like it when I do it just like this
(Ain't nothing but a jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like that
(Ain't nothing but a Keith Sweat jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like this
(Ain't nothing but a jam)
How do you like it when I do it just like that
(Ain't nothing but a Keith Sweat jam, babe)
