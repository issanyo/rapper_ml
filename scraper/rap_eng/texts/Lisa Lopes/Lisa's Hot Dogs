      Ohh, Lisa.. you offered us a Hot Dog
We said yes so you made us a Hot One
You come back with the plate of Hot Dogs
We said No so you had a big strop on
We were walking into the Room
You pulled my arm and started shouting
You walked off but you stuck the v's up
I told my mam, she started going mad
We walked out and said were never coming back
For one of Lisa's Hot Dogs
