(No, no, no, no, no scrubs)

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta (busta)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class, and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, no scrub
No scrub, no scrub

You don't believe in paying fully for the first date, first rate
Say you wearing Gucci, no, that shirt fake
I don't care how much money you've got in the first place; jerk traits
You've got more problems than China's birth-rate
Don't even have a work-space but you have a Benz, with no money from your friends
They incidental, you pretend
I'm not a gold-digger, you don't even know figure
'Cause you say you got 0's that you'll just get me the roll quicker
(No scrubs, no scrubs)
Baby keep your size of rack
My wish them off with my battle-axe
Your nappy full has quit on chicks
And that's the sad effect
Maybe they had cataracts, couldn't see your game
Out hidden like magic hats, like from David Blaine
But you know end of the frame
Certainly not innocent
Look into your inner, there's no winner
Never been a gent
Not looking for milicant
Flying like a dove, but I'll say and put in print
'Cause they're much more than a scrub

(No scrub, no scrub)

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
