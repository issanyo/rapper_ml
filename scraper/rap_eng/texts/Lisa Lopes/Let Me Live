[Intro]
Let me live Let me live Let me live Let me live

[N.I.N.A.]
Ya'll niggas really know me from the stories I tell (tell) From the lifestyle I lead and the records I sell (sell) Caught up in situations detrimental to me And I've been through every war just for the world to see That time is always movin' situations do change And things don't always work out just the way that we plan Still stand necessary be my friend and my foe  Either love me or you hate me That's how the game goes If it's wrong  To be respected never ever say die Remain strong Never neglect to spread my wings and fly Like you I've been through struggles so much stress on my brain Actin' out my life on stages and still had to maintain Question my every decision My intentions were good Twist the story all around and leave me misunderstood Imagine that No privacy but that's the price of this fame Under attack My destiny to be a soldier through rain

Chorus:
I flow I flow Like water like water And my desire Like fire like fire I'm kickin' up dirt From the earth the earth Imaginin' I'm the wind  Redeliverin' from deeper within

Chorus

[Eastwood]
I'm just tryin' to become the moment At the same time overcome every opponent Yeah I rest on the West but I wanna own it Sensational rhymer I was taught to paper chase as a minor Till my bank account matches the population in China I'm grindin'  And you might find it funny That I bought a icy Rolex to show you my time is money I got rules and jewels you can choose to use if you need 'em Every day you don't hustle you abusin' your freedom Gotta execute your plannin' as well Cuz understand if you fail to plan My nigga you plannin' to fail Gigantic cannons in his hand when he bailed Gettin' panties up in the candy Chavelle They want me trapped in a raggedy cell But the bad guy normally wins I'm the reason these Republicans build so many pens I'ma live for show I'm makin' the west coast tighter I'm Crooked I Your ghost writer's writer

Chorus

[N.I.N.A.]
Just to make it in this world and go against all odds Come from the gritty in the city to a superstar Number one hit consistently for 10 long years Put my soul in every project my blood sweat and my tears Y'all you know my status Left Eye the baddest Underestimated don't hate it I keep it lavish But it don't mean nothin' if I can't find peace of mind Packin' all distractions away leave 'em behind Say goodbye hard times small crimes and felonies A new beginnin' I'm winnin' envisionin' the breeze I'm dressed in all white linen and fallin' to my knees Thankful for all that's been given I'm livin' with ease Tropical trees 90 degrees please Do like the birds and the bees and start a family So reminisce on every line that I wrote  Know that I never will surrender and it's truth that I spoke

Chorus
