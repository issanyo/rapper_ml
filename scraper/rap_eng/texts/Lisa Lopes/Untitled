[N.I.N.A.]
It's all in my head
Yeah that's what we said
I ought to be listening to
No one instead
My thoughts beam with precision
Just like infrared
Then I sought out my visions
And found poison lead
What the fuck?
Is that my dear friend?
Counting ten, Nina (N.I.N.A.) at (add) it again
Live if you want
Die if you choose
Laugh if you will
Cause these are the rules
Oh, y'all don't know Nina (N.I.N.A.)
My evil twin
Who came from within
Whom I blame all my sins
Ooh, yeah it's on like the gas in my stove
With no pilot
It's waiting for me
To come light it
Woo, hypnotized by the flames
Bound by the locks and the chains
I see smoke in my mirrors
If it don't get any clearer
In due time we gon' find who's superior
