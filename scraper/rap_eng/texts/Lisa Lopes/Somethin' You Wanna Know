Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
Don't you talk to the world
You can talk to me baby
Somethin' you wanna know

Yo Left Eye
I can't believe he fell for that rumor
All he had to do was come ask you

Sittin' all alone can't think of nothin' better to do
So yo I keeps callin' you
Each discussion's a little bit colder
Seems to me you givin' two of those shoulders
Whatever it is and if it's nothin'
I wish that you would tell me somethin'
Got me thinkin' I'm losin' you
Yo so what am I suppose to do

[Hook:]
Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
Don't you talk to the world
You can talk to me baby
Somethin' you wanna know
Ask me boy
I'll tell you so
You can talk to your girl
I won't lie to you baby

Scratchin' up the phone goin' crazy
You think it' atin't suppose to phase me
Yellin' at you for even startin' to belive
In any kind of that crap street yap you been receivin'
And what's so unfair
You been doggin' me out about matters unclear
You can't solve a problem it it's trapped inside your mind
It's a conversation blind

[Hook]

You know you shouldn't fall for everything that they tell you
Unless you get it straight from the horse's mouth (ah)
You know that everything they tell you boy is just hearsay
You gotta be careful when the rumor's out

True enough now you know if I were to pick up
A piece of that he say she say stuff
Think about it
I would doubt it as to callin' a bluff
But unlike you I wouldn't breaka da rules
By jumpin' into concluse
I'd eat a steak and potato while thinkin' it over later
Leave a tip two quarters and a condom for the waiter
What to do
Now's the time I decided to bring it on back to you
So we can talk it through and through
Becasue it ain't nothin' better than talkin' to me
When you wanna know somethin'
Than havin' to get a piece of info from who knows
I'm gettin' fed up cause yo cuz
Words become a quote or somethin' better like a story
It's far from okey doke close to fiction
Half is true but then the other is a conviction
So I'm blamed with an infliction
From which others have created
Then have socially debated
So yo don't you know that the story's been inflated

[Hook]

You know you shouldn't fall for everything that they tell you
Unless you get it straight from the horse's mouth (hey)
You know that everything that they tell you boy is just hearsay
You gotta be careful (careful) when the rumor's out

You can talk to me, you can talk to me
If it's somethin' you wanna know (something you wanna know)
They just ask me baby
Ooh so tenderly (so tenderly)
I'll tell you what you wanna hear (I'll tell you somethin')
You can talk to your girl
I won't lie to you baby

Remember don't let anyone come between you
With he say she say
Yeah you know those words
And this advice is never to be forgotten
That misery loves company (I'll tell you so)
And this special shot goes out to all those
(You can talk to your girl)
(I won't lie to you baby)
Who are in love
Peace

[Hook]
