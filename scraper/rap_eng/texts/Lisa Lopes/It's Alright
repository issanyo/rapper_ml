[Verse 1: Chilli (TV show samples)]
I don’t watch TV
Cuz I can’t stand the news (that tragedy occurred)
It’s always bad news
It’s like havin’ a fortune
And now you ain’t got a dime (he lost everything)
It’s all bad news
Talk shows show us how sick some people can be (next on Jerry Spr…)
But I don’t let that bother me
I keep my eyes to the sky
And God in my life
So it don’t bother me

[Chorus]
It’s alright
It’s alright
Let's party tonight
We’re gonna have a good time
Let's just party on
Till the break of dawn
We’re gonna have a good time
Cuz it’s alright

[Verse 2: Chilli]
I can’t lose my mind
Cuz if I do
Party over oops out of time
Thoughts of war
Hangin’ in my mind (is the mission in Iraq)
Party over oops out of time
We’ll see the day
Races are broken
Talks of war no more
Graduation rates so high
Nobody’s a fool
Now that’s good news

[Chorus]
It’s alright
It’s alright
Let's party tonight
We’re gonna have a good time
Let's just party on
Till the break of dawn
We’re gonna have a good time
Cuz it’s alright

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Wanna dance with a cutie
In the pale moonlight
It’s my duty
Check two fresh and fruity
Sweet like candy ass
Make a pass for the booty
I fantasize interludes
When I’m in the mood
See me in the nude
No time to rewind
When the bass line rides for two
Feel me in the groove
I rock on and on till the break of dawn
Feet don’t stop me now come and sing along
As I catch repped it with a two step
Pop that foot in hard
Time to break a sweat
Let it play Mr. DJ
Stimulatin’ on the floor
Till I can’t dance no more
Gotta react
If the club is packed
Where the party’s at
It’s Left Eye at the back door (back door)

[Chorus (2x)]
It’s alright
It’s alright
Let's party tonight
We’re gonna have a good time
Let's just party on
Till the break of dawn
We’re gonna have a good time
Cuz it’s alright
