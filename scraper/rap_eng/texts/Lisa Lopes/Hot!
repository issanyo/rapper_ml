She's the one you thought would never do a solo LP
Yeah now what chick could outsell me (what chick)
Drama comes in dozens and I know you love it
A rose is still a rose so I rose above it (yeah)
The more that they see the woman got a mind of her own
The less that they want a part of my throne it figures
But the more they compare me to the ones they could own
They know they never should have left me alone
I'm bigga no doubt Money gamin and my g's is up
Now Treat me like David Blaine and freeze me up
Let me address the issue I'm super not superficial
Spoil me The only statement I'm makin' is royalties
7 digits never under my bank account hold
Numbers like your phone number plus area code
Gamble with your career
Go ahead chance her
See what happened with scrubs on my records
Deserve answers

Everybody wanna know where the hell you been
Oh Left Eye
Teachers children mothers and thugs
Everybody loves Miss Left Eye
