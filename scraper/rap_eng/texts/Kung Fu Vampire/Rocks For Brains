[Verse 1: Mr. Grey]
I lose my shit
So when a bitch straight skitzo
Freak off a leash wanna spread sheets lets go
She was like Hi Grey I'm your biggest fan
My name is Hannah understand that you gonna be my man
I'm like goddamn pounding pussy is the plan
She got a face of an angel I got a demon kind of sand
She seems to be the crazy kind
Lushes full up shes from behind
Love to swallow up nuts laced with a squirrelly mind
If I find liquid courage hidden in my liquor storage
Knock up your pants to pass and keep this shit current
She got my name tattooed, a blazing bleeding taboo
She cuckoo for cocoa, practice sin voodoo
I saw Mr. Grey dog covered in clique goo
Little loopy Lucy loo rather die than live without you know who
I take a test drive but I want a model that's brand new
She hate to keep a comb up for the moment she's gonna have to do

[Hook: ClockworC]
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know

[Verse 2: ClockworC]
Never be getting my piece, like a hoes peace, my phone be
Blowing up when she blowing up
Kamikaze in my dome piece
A bitch I wouldn't dare to kiss her
A funeral loving them lips
I don't negotiate with terrorists
She coming up into my bed like
Hands down hands up
I'm having your baby we gots to fuck
She knocking me up in the head with a loaded Glock
While screaming times up
She puckering up and she clocks up
Come hijacked done unconsciously
I wake up and she bouncing with that bubble butt
I'm bout to cum
Bow-wow-biddy-baw-baw
To bounce her whole life she stage 5
Groupie then get wifey Mikey like it but she batshit
Crazy get out of my grave-y just to claim up on the taxes
I'm past this point of no return but I'm hoping she toning it in the traffic
When I never got caught in that high speed and they crash it
I'm tragic I'm crying from laughing and thinking
Yo why she gotta be so crazy chasing babies in my semen
But then again I think I like that crazy little freaky bitch

[Hook: ClockworC]
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
Bounce back bitch
There's hella children dead on your mattress
Catfish, you don't take a math whiz, fast pitch
Ten million strong you just a actress
Probably kill a future president with your snatch shit
The last batches
Make me hard like two conjoined twins having sex in two different cars
Don't get me wrong you filthy sexy I ain't trying to be mean
Even poodle thinks your alien pussy is bizzare
Sin girl do dress up as Harley Quinn for Halloween
And pass out pumpkins to munchkins for pumpkin
Spice latte grande ain't that something
My junks in her mouth like a run on sentence
Dirty Sanchez just a preference
On that application now we bumping ugly zen
I ain't even know her for five minutes
Six or seven and not a limit is a gimmick
You sucking penis at an '89 Plymouth
She call my dick as my leaving bitches breathless
And breakfast never tasted so good
We living reckless

[Hook: ClockworC]
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know
She got rocks where her brains should be
But damn baby doll be my favorite freak
When I say get down
She like daddy how low
I tell her stop playing bitch you already know
