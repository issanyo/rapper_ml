[Verse 1]
You can taste the sacrifice, it ain't got nothin' to do with the Antichrist
A massive price to pay, these aphrodites can acid rights
This skeptical weapon tactical method stepping with the essence of a slice of life
My evil presence got you second guessing but I feel it right
But it's enticing, I'm nice and stronger than a bison fighting
And I'm even colder than a cold church older than vultures that's war
So they're poaching with a Kavorkian sword
Mold her into an enemy that I can afford
The elephant in the sky you truly should not ignore
Sacrificial juxtapose
In Hell they hold the eskimos
Kiss your little angel toes
Combustable, and anything goes
Cradle's mould, I pagan baby blows my dick
And everyone in town is crazy bro
I know it's sick
But I didn't create that shit
I hate that shit
Embrace that shit
I ate that shit
And erase that shit
Outta my brain and do it again
Get robbed of all my insanity
Can it be, randomly, selected
No it's you
Protected by the enemy of the red, white, and blue!

[Hook]
I'm walking dead and alive
Earth lady, blood baby die
They wanna taste it, mama
But they the face of drama
An ancient state that waste away as we became piranha, no guarantees manana
Let's save the earth and work to seek Nirvana

[Verse 2]
First thing I'mma do, the second thing on ya mind
Three strikes for humanity, all these people ain't fine
All these dead bodies in a line up, in a system that's jerk-ed
This hate we possess 'em how we stay smirking
The enemy stay lurking, powder it stay cooking
Talking it way louder, but, they lay shook-ed
Smelling that gunpowder, eating that clam chowder
How do you even doubt her?
Misfire, abort, savage
When the tots I'm ravaging constantly fight the urge
And it's looking quite suburb, but no opposition emerge
You posture are but a nerd, I cossage you with a blur
Hostile, obnoxious, but I ain't concerned
You saying the wordsmith
But the actions are cracking, smacking your lips
And I'm packing positivity
With packs in poverty, anonymous anomaly, economy
Out of a dire dichotomy, precise, separation advice, a slice of life!

[Hook]
