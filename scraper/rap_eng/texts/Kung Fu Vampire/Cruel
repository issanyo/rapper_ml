[Verse One: Wrekonize]
She got a chemical dependency, and dark dark tendencies
To wanna' get next to me, and do things, sexually
Sadomasochistic had to kick it with the misfit
Deeper with the dickness, down like Deebo and I whip shit
You got a lot of daddy issues, I subscribe
For everything I had to get to, feeling your vibe
What you want? Torture, candle wax, flames
Rolling down your body fast, snapping whips, chains
Spiderman's gang, with an old school approach
You like it rough and then I buff with hands around your throat
I'm happy to oblige, but let's set up ya' safeword
But you can't even say it cause your mouth has been tapered
This is a dark, dark fantasy
So come and see the faculty, we breaking backs since Sarah Lee
You know you love it when I'm beating the breaks off
Crueler than I ever was so come get your cake pop!

[Chorus]
You're so cruel, that's why I really love it
It's so attractive to me
You're so mean, that's what's so good about it
It's so addictive to me
I hate you, but I really love you
Cause you're so cruel, to me
To me
To me

[Verse Two: Kung Fu Vampire]
She enjoys being choked out and ball-gagged
Vagina meat beating hella' bad
Still leaking breastmilk, trynna' call me dad
It's all cupcakes and cadillacs, cuddle and a shitty thing that makes her mad
In front of her friends, she frontin' like she one of them
Now she straight up S and M, chains and whips and mass-ai
No masochist, she wants her ass whipped quick
Lickin' the tip, slittin' wrists, let it drip, no ego trip
Spit blood on my chocolate starfish
Cruel intentions turn to cool inventions, that's Mars bitch
Gun in the clit, running the train on her little sis
I insist that we stop there
No, treat my dick like a glass pipe
Smoking dope, blazed on the face on her stripper pole
Making a mess all over the place
Cum everywhere
She's a nasty trick, her pretty little itty bitty pussycat does what it thinks
And then it winks!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Bernz]
He say that we getting easy money out here on the road
She say I'm a playa, prolly fucking with a couple hoes
When they get together they be gossiping, God knows
Talking this and that 'bout who am I and where I go
Like I give a fuck
You must like to suck, cause you're riding on my dick like a camel hump
Yeah, you can be my favourite hater, please do me the favour
I'll add you to the list of friends, you can thank me later
And Miami's well swim, so I'm used to alligators
Looks like I'm on the way up, mighta broke the elevator
I'm the alpha and the beta
Vader on a feda, never waiver, so the haters always watching from the hangars
Oh my
You dream of my demise but the army never dies
All they do is multiply
Me and Wrek were trynna dive
Deeper in the cosmic sky
While the lines stay forming outside
Tell me why!
