[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
Tsch, man I don't give a fuck if you suckin' a penis or duckin' subpoenas
You lucky to meet this respect as somethin' that I earn as a fetus
You tryna burn and defeat us, and question who is the cleanest, take off that rap costume, we'll surely see who's the meanest
You try to come in between us but this monster is grown
I'll show you the concepts of war
Constantly on top of ya property, still in your throne
It's obvious you're a clone dog, throw you a bone raw!
I actually kick it with the director who made the movie Saw
You kickin' it with bitches who get you to buy 'em shit down at the mall
I'll touch one hundred broads, you fuck one hundred balls
Over chicks who ain't even fucked to have to wear wonder bras
I'll eat you in the flesh, defeat you in the booth
Speak to you in death, sprinkle you with truth
I just wanna hit 'em with a little bit of venom that'll get inside ya mothafuckin' melted brain
Kung Fu Vampire ignites the flame

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Yo, don't get it twisted off of an image you ain't used to seein'
I'll break you to pieces, only one that be able to save you was Jesus
There's bullshit goin' on, I think you the reason
You niggas refused to get it, until I make you believe it
Now when I make new releases I'm always peepin' out the way you conceive it
You motherfuckers better take it or leave it
And ever since the game put me in a random position, I've had the ambition to beat you with my pants in the kitchen
I'm goin' manabalistic, take a look at my fuckin' life
Grab the statistics
I've been like this way back in the distance
Rappin' this six-shit on my own with a lack of assistance
You seem so eager, you niggas just need to back up and listen
You rappers with no skill don't deserve to get the fame, shit's changed it's like everyone's purpose is the same
My new purpose in the game's to keep Eazy from turnin' in his grave until his name is permanently safe

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
But back to the matter, my faction is packed with gun-splatter
You lack to buy data (who dat) oh that's more brains that I scatter
Posses pop up I put more remains on the platter
Copycats enough of combat but they can't climb the ladder
This is the death of me, so tell the referee that it's my destiny
To collect refugees, and feed 'em ecstasy, a lethal recipe (plus!)
My [?tippin' is lyrical?] weaponry, I think ya best to be battlin' bitches that's havin' sex with me, bitches that havin' second guesses and questionin' everyone are you filled with oestrogen
All of my people what's left of 'em, you pesterin', cause ya boys in this method in got you effin' and actin' Vaseline actin' tenactin'  half of 'em laughin' that just a rappin'
Your only craft is networkin' on MySpace
I'm here to change the game, not make it a fuckin' disgrace of race in yo fuckin' mind, my chains is all you can taste
Kung Fu Vampire and Hopsin in ya face!
