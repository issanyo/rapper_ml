Mary Jane's been hired but I fired her up
Employee of the month winning the canibus cup
When the keg came in I retired whats up
With my hoes cracking jokes
Draculate and see my folks
I see in the jacuzzi he soaks
I dont see a need to be vicious Loc
Prevoke the hoes Swally gives a toast
To the one and only west coast
Most mother fuckers haven't had a chance
To catch a glance on what we gots
Bitches beaches big driveways 5 acre lots
24 hour sideways master of party plots
And its like that Stalks crops and micro dots
Walking up at 3 P.m Your guns in I'm in the den
Alone on the phone I sit
Call in some kicks
Waiting for the homis with the spliffs lit
And then I hit the roach until six

(Hook)
Its almost daylight we party all night
Its almost daylight we party all night
Its almost daylight we party all night
We get high tonight, fly tonight, We high tonight
Its almost daylight we party all night
Its almost daylight we party all night
Its almost daylight we party all night
We get high tonight, fly tonight, We high tonight

The crowd was outa control when I waked in the gates
My proom rangs A fuction where no one tripped on my fangs
The first thing I see is A bonzi tree
And a lava lamp empty bottles of J and D was slanging Amps
Beyond funny hilarious Risky to frisk me you with me
I'm headed for the poolamadorie side work
But now I'm worth two the homie next to me he's through
Pass out spill the bong water on the comfy couch
Thats what the plastic on the carpet no doubt
A rookie that'll never score, skeletor Grill on the floor
But still lots of love from all the women
I think we should all go swimming
Nudity high heels, steamy sex appeals
Arobic women doing what the feels
I love three exotic like a full day of meals
Turning my wheels

(Hook)

Being served up massages by six hands
Chewing on stems Watching time bandits the biggest fan
A va vampira sipping on champagn
Running a muck on your campaign
Hard to maintain
No tan lines skinny dippins next
Grab the trailer for the waverunners as they flex
Like heros shaved in tank tops
Doing belly flops off the dock
Fortunatly they ain't tryin to cock block
Big block chevy motor pullin us at sixty
Black lit full moon calm no typhoon even the racoons
Taking hits a v Black kitty eating dry tips so dont even trip
Dont slip we ain't broke but deffinatly hip
Keeping composser even the doja got me ripped
Best leave a tip in a cup At the bar ITs almost daylight We party all night
