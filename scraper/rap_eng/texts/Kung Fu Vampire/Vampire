[verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
What you know about a Vampire death row
Inmates clepto, kept those for memero-
Bilia so I can feel ya
Neckromancing and necrophilia now’s your chance in
I’m breaking and shaking and making them do my dance
The dragon-eous snake charmer begin to entrance
Advancing checks to my undead army
Of natives and zombies, no Abercrombies
Just Eyethai’s and Dutch to get you out the clutch
Never can you move
Never can you stay
Never can you leave
You will always breathe
No shadow its death, left in a whirlwind
Surrounded by those who can’t decipher sin
I’m a lifer in the game of eternity
Ain’t no unfamiliar fame gonna turn on me
I’m the same outcast from the Mediterranean sea
Exhausted your temple mentally

[Hook (x2)]
Vampire, Fang Fang—we bite necks
Satire, Bang Bang—two to the chest
All the killers gather round for the blood-fest
No incest we infest infecting the west

[Bridge]
Can’t stop running 'round, it will get bloody
Can’t stop running 'round, it will get bloody
Can’t stop running 'round in circles, I can’t stop running
Can’t stop running 'round in circles, after your bloody kind

[2nd Verse: Kung Fu Vampire]
A fatal kiss I’m not a killer I’m a feminist
An atheist do these Pharaohs provide evidence
Imagine the future, but presently I reminisce
Her eminence severs all the evidence of intelligence
What I didn’t have she possessed pure elements
I was known to grab and not ask protest the eloquence
Estes relevant, bless this celibate, bless this for the hell of it
‘Cuz I’m the one telling it your soul came smelling it
If I take away all the suffering and pain
If I let you play and there’s nothing I will gain
If I grant eternally undead to sustain
Half life is interesting and never mundane
I greet them and invite um in
Bleed um and recite the hymn
De-seed the flower proceed to bite um with a grin
Thanks for the vitamins
Minerals hyping me up for the win
I’m whimsical plus my favorite sport is sin

[Hook (x2)]
Vampire, Fang Fang—we bite necks
Satire, Bang Bang—two to the chest
All the killers gather round for the blood-fest
No incest we infest infecting the west

[Bridge]
Can’t stop running 'round, it will get bloody
Can’t stop running 'round, it will get bloody
Can’t stop running 'round in circles, I can’t stop running
Can’t stop running 'round in circles, after your bloody kind
Vampire—Fang Fang!
