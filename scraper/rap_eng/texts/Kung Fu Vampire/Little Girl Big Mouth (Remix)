[Verse 1: Lex the Hex Master]
Little girl big mouth, get ya tongue ripped out
Split mouth when I fist pound talk some shit now
Sick how you talking shit about hoes I dick now
Every time I hit town, you the first to give a pound
Split crowns when I spit rounds spin you fitted round wicked sounds study my lyrics (they all critics now)
Make you wanna click ya mouse, feeling top flipping out I dick around and have ya grandmoms waving her wig around
I pick up ya hatred, jealousy, frustration, got you patiently waiting, salvating and heart-racing
Just see if I'mma make you just say shit, embrace it, I'm bout to be ya lady's new favorite
