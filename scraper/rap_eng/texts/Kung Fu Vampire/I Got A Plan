[Verse 1: C-Mob]

I'm tryna make y'all believe in a man
With a devious plan, retrieving the grands
Leaving enemies in the sand, with ease and I a can
Just feed from the Queen of the Damned
But I'm bout feeding my fam
Gotta make it so we eat more than peas in a can
I can be a jackass like Viva La Bam
If you really wanna try to put your teeth in my hand
Givin y'all a reason to scram
Better get the hazmat suit, there's no immunity to my illness
I don't care if you feel this, but if anybody hate
Then I'mma hit that Kill Switch
I go get it you bums get no credit
Prepare for your cancellation
Workin' so hard that my hands are aching
And I have learned to withstand the hating
Cause I made a transformation; like Optimus Prime
I drop the sick rhymes, I got to get mind, no stopping this shine
And the people keep saying I'm bout to get signed
You cannot fathom what's off in this mind sometimes
It's like a tomb of depression
Where the demons are doomed to be wrestling
Angels so I'm usually stressing
Sick of gutter living, I'm driven to make a killing, but it gets a little difficult doin' it independent
I'm a super villain chillin' in a risky spot
And if the rap game ever gets me got
Then use my music as a 'forget-me-not'
'Til then I'm kicking back these whiskey shots
And the shit we plot's outta hand
Just me and the fam, and damn right we got a plan

[Hook: C-Mob]x2
I got a plan
To make a better living I'm driven I gotta get my paper
The doves might have to cry
Because I might go back to my old behavior
Behold I'm cold, i never sold my soul to get the cash in hand
And I never fold no matter the cards in my hand
I'm bold, I got a master plan

[Verse 2: JL B.Hood]
I don't have any options
Nigga gotta get the money whether or not it's legally
My dirty hands need a washing
Thought I was done but I'm comin back
Cause I gotta get it regardless
Shit get hard being a struggling artist
Spit, keep going, I know you one of the hardest
Sick, keep calm, I know you inheriting all this
Flip these poems, something gotta get farther
Return of the darkness, heart hella black involved with this crap
March right into war and I'm strapped
On contact I'm ready for combat
Nigga gotta eat, my stomach ready for that
I'm steady yelling I'm making a habit
Rather than making an automatic
To have dope coming in magic
Unaverage amounts, I imagine it in
And it got me in the lab with a pen, fond of a hem
But I really can't imagine havin a real friend
Do what it takes to make the wheel spin
No breaks, another mistake ain't set in
What will it take to get straight, with no faith in
On the brink of sinking off the deep in
In the street with heat tellin what I been dreamin
To the fiends that tweak, they still believe in me
It's humbling, but the past keep mumbling
Trash keep tumbling in, fast will I last
I'm wondering when in the past
Cause my ass keeps summoning sin for the cash
Looking for a better way to make a better Living
I'm playing in the game, be killed or make a killing
I got a feelin you won't understand
No time to chill nigga, I got a plan

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
Whether or not you got the wickedest plot
Just remember that people just sitting and waiting for your slot
Who woulda thought that this have not woulda ended up on top
With a house full of crops like me
In search of the power of the hour of your motherfucking last breath
And everybody with you but I pass the test
I scream fuck the rest
You guessed it, invested in my career I believe in my art
You can see that it'll never be gone or fall apart
At ease in the east when I kill the priest
And receive every disease in my bleeding heart
When I read in the dark, and I'm leaving these marks
Put the seed in the car, receive and the park
Got no time to reflect cause my daughter needs her dad
I provide all the love that the world never had
You should break bad being barely broke
Too many people, populate the planet
And we're bringing up all the damage
And we thinking that we're living up it; far from equal
You never had the master plan, another feeding off the man
This working for a living, Not giving a fuck about anybody
My shotty got a few names on it, could be some blood stains on it
Leaving your family its not as the honesty policy magically onto me
Nevermind the economy, never a wannabe
I'm living proof that economy sombering nomally
Humbly spoken, took a few years now I'm finally broken
Never had a need for the ego stroking
Sever all a my ties with the flees, cause I'm a G smoking
Stepping on the crabs in the bucket
I'm here to handle business, that's why I say "fuck it"
