[Hook] x2
She is a villain, she is just like me
Out of control and you despise me
But you're just like me
Out of control and you despise me

[Verse 1]
Shatter my soul and I'm dripping in the rat race
It's no wonder that I'm fast paced
Worship OG with the fat lace
Got molested at seven and I'll never forget that face
What up bitch? Couldn't get no other dick, now look what you created, just for the fun of it
A sexiopath and I'm constantly faded and properly awkward this mockery stopping me
Nobody thought I would've taken it this far, even though they say that I an beautifully bizarre, I'm the definition of a death star, sometimes drunk star fights at a bar
One of the weirdest in the game, leave you inebriated, my eyes have changed, my vibe is strange, an odd world that I've arranged
With a little bit of love and a little bit of hate we get hard to do the things that really start to vindicate
Make it or break it love it or run away screaming knowing you ain't got another voice
But how the Earth is really run you can take a stand like a man or run away with your boys (BITCH)
You're about to bring out the illest in the Kung Fu Vampire, I'm the king of revenge and I will get my vengeance this is my empire

[Hook] x2
She is a villain, she is just like me
Out of control and you despise me
But you're just like me
Out of control and you despise me

[Verse 2]
Out of control and I'm living up in the fast lane
I only know the gas maine no need for brakes
Both hands on the pedal shift 9 and the 3
This is the place that I plot on my enemy
Dopplegang I'm just blending in to society
Then the windows erupt nobody got a single eye on me
Hotbox and that Paris O.G I can't see through the clouds
And the devil didn't make me do it I'm nonstop delivering fresh crops just trying to make a living
I'm never looking for props you know what my fangs giving destruction and mass consumption
They feed me [?] on thirst disfunction
The hopeless need more, my occupation is so see-through
But I still see whores with cycle
To devour of the darkest hour of your last  breath
Take it or leave, love it or run away breathing
But sometimes you ain't got another choice
But now I'm gonna give what you can take or run away with your boys (BITCH)
You're about to bring out the illest in the Kung Fu Vamp
I'm the king of revenge and I will get my vengeance
Repentance is for the weak

[Hook] x2
She is a villain, she is just like me
Out of control and you despise me
But you're just like me
Out of control and you despise me
