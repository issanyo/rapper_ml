[Verse 1]
From the depths of the wept ones
That swept through the west
With the best guns (California)
So inept, No respect here collect funds
We were born in to debt, you can bet Non
Steal your Pets and the Vets and arrest there Best son
Killing system designed to take away all the fun
Next One on the list was the mother of allllll son of a none of us
Intelligent beings 1 of us is slithering all the truss
Hullucinations causing altercasions mental patient
Addicted to new Sensation justification
The relationships you Brew, your wet the precipitation
Is lying to yourself seeping through your see through vest
From the bottom of the bottle and the worm that left you
Disease that dressed you and manifest two
Personalities that you claim depress you
Forgot the Jack daniels & blaming guess who?
Test Tube toxic in Peace We Rest You
I blessed you stop it, you still can make boocoo bucks
Fucks wit a classy lady, get a new job
Get some new clothes stop trying to rob
Liven a sloberish life, turnin men into mice
It’s venomous tinge, in the spirit of bad advice
That you took -n- ran with
Brain lacks development
Got super low bandwidth
That's how I'm smelling it

[Hook]
Go Away, Won’t you Go away
You're no good for me, it’s so plain to see
You take away all my sunshine
Steal all my dreams
Kill my self esteem

[Verse 2]
You lost 15 years to Sierra Nevada
Kentucky bourbon
Stomachs burnin
Getting further away from all your dreams
All the things you wanted to achieve so distantly naive
Your system is dying in your sleep
When your awake your hiding
In the shadows of the old you
And ya never inviting
You could use some tofu, maybe some kung fu vampire
To hold you and your whole crew
This hug is a break through
I'm indulging n truth
We all got crutches but your withering Proof
It’s like a fetus that they had to induce
It wasn’t good to know you your a Typical Spoof
You chopped every Root, in your neighborhood
Even fail at substance abuse
Turn your back and your all good
Leave your family in debt
No regret so just lay there and reflect

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Spirit enters body
Out comes Dragon
Next it’s the shit talkin’
How you toe tagging
Braggin bout the people that you knocked out in high school
Imaginary stuck in the past looking for Minds to rule
Nobody thinks it cool that you owe all your friends money
And have nerve to call us tools
How many thugs have you pissed off lately
Not many lucid thoughts so know one knows if you crazy
Oh is it such a nightmare (swaged)
To be in your shoes
I guess you never heard the concept of Paid Dues
I guess you prolly heard of the man that-had made moves
And plus your always worried about who’s buying the brew
13 days clean don’t mean shit to me
Now you have Jesus to forgive you
But ain't fit to be, get hit wit a fee
Just to get an hour with your kids that you hardly ever see

[Hook]
