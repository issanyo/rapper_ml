Conan O'Brien: Uh, ya know, it's a big part of your job, as a vampire, to sprout teeth, bite people in the neck, drink their blood, but it seems to me like it's very important to have the correct vampire face. Am I wrong, or does it seem there need to be like a required face, that a vampire must make just for biting into the neck?

[Verse 1]
Rise from the ashes, out the haberdashery no 20 lashes, no need for a castle, I'm all action, hey little ninja I heard that you was flashing, who's asking, I can't get no satisfaction, in my mind I'm living up in a mansion, highly irrational sensationalism botanicalism sacrifice my life in ya face, with a pigeon, bad decision, precision, my point of entry through exorcism, molested a eskimo, tested my naked body, end of my sentiments, send 'em back to the new millennium in the beginning of minimum wage, my fornicatin' is complicated I'm turning the page
Caught in the middle of hell, and these Christians bought in to sell my optic vision, holy sacrilege, sacramental cannibal laughing with Brotha Lynch, I'm happy to cuddle up with ya shriveled up corpse bitch

[Verse 2]
I'm the hardest pro-black nigga rapper since 2Pac, the reincarnation of Vincent Price with the duwop, a true plot to kill every person I see in two blocks, a flu shot, can't stop the infection of Vamp I'm too hot, [???] got 3 Camel packs, but he gon need more, a little fire hydrant, mad child to hydrate ya core, or, you can ignore everything I'm doing while smashing ya whore, smearing ya lipstick the shitkickin misfit, XO, petty with mesco, play with the breatho, my manifesto, a klepto, maniac man-eater, a plant-beater, a stampeder stomping out on ya neck in a sedative repetitive notion, in a ocean of electric snakes, spread the legs open like a baddie in Section 8, patty cake, patty cake, cocaine nostril, another night at the opera you can't escape
