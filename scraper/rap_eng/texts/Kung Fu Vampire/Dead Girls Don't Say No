(Verse 1)
I don't care if your friends think i'm a joke
You can see me on the news wearing a cloak
While you snort coke
And poke at your own wounds
My people are dancin
To the beat of there own tune
And im on the moon
Looking at mars from across the room
And hes like "kill that bitch
Oh wait she's already dead"
She ain't a snitch no more
Stainin the ground red
You know that i found-ed
And begin to pound it
And the hoe that i have mounted
Even in the ground i really can't help it
Im a little bit selfish
So i brought her along im helpless
Was it everything you expected you get when injected with embalming fluid
Guts resurected
Here goes the errection
The acension of 666
For the devil bitch
7 for the heaven when i got the itch for jesus
Hate is enough
My harem only grows when im rough
Call tech N9ne tell him bout my dead girl stuff
Ten ways that we can kill this pace
Ive had enough

(2x's Chorus)
Dead girls don't say
Dead girls don't say
Dead girls don't say
NO NO NO

(Verse 2)
I butter my toast with the dirt from her blood stream
Utter no words look up the dress of a blood queen
Obscene with a canteen spilled
Keep my canteen filled
With the marrow of a pharoe as they stamped still
Embarks on a hole
Gathering up the body parts slow
Repo genetic operation on hotties thats cold
People pay top dollar
To get hot and bothered
Now drop wallet
Animalistic by nature she fiends for the collar
Around her neck i pound and wreck
She fiend for a scholar
Checkin for an answer for the phase she has no mean for the dollar
I get her wet
Wait
Lubricate
Hold her head so she can watch (?)
Its saturday night and im tripping she ain't hit rigor mortis yet
For this matter im slippin cuz we ain't hit the border
Order these things you can't dream of im hostile
We're awful and i still ate her body like a falafel

(Chorus)
