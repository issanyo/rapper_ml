[Verse 1: Acie High]
I was born in the constellation Leo
Right along with them Dallas, Texas people
I ran with them Houston, Texas killas
So that means that I'm a real life nigga
But on this land of ho shit and deceitful man
Beautiful sexy conniving whores, ain't no such thing as a peaceful plan
Prick my finger and pledge an oath so now I'm around with an evil clan
[?]look in the eye of an unknown [?] left in a lethal trance
Exotic sex cuz you don't have a clue what the fuck is next
Conform with what every drug is made
And play Russian Roulette with casual sex
It's getting clearer so please try keeping up
I'm in the mirror of whom I'm speaking of
Visions is horrid, the pictures distorted
Mission's aborted and I'm leaking blood
Cuz leaches are lurking, looking to still seem low and peep my wealth
Had to drastically change my image just to compete everyday to be myself
Now I'm all or in and invested to killing everything that's a threat
Stand off or land off boats like Gandalf on fake [?] that ended up being a [?]

[Hook]
Full moons in the sky, something's weird tonight
Am i already dead or should i fear for my life?
I'm reaching the point where I can't see clear
Seems that everybody that comes near...
Is a bloodsucker [x2]
You can say what you want but you's a bloodsucker
Gotta stay away from you, can't let my blood touch ya
Cuz ain't no telling what goes on with a bloodsucker


[Verse 2: Kung Fu Vampire]
Everywhere I go I got a leech on my side
Creeping my refrigerator for a piece of my pie
And I'm keeping a beast in my ride
If you can't comply Imma punch you in the eye
So you see me when you lie
These repetitive sedatives got the editor
Ready to eat the cheddar or head or the competitor met her fate
The letter that set her off, now you gonna need to remedicate, elevate
Marinate that brain on something with a better face, bitter taste
Wait?! What do you mean you don't eat meat?!
Bitch gobble dick like a Thanksgiving feast
Bitch swallow cum like a Catholic priest
Bitch sucking dick of the old and deceased
Doing a downward facing dog cuz you're about to get greased
I can see it on your face, you about to preach
Draws to mosquitoes sucking on a host
You're the hurricane that floods the boat
Your entire family controls the vote
That's why I don't ever believe cuz you're a lost hope
Flow amongst [?]
Tried to convince the population
That a bloodsucker is the one with needs as we bleed
But this is your congregation

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Priceless]
Who's there? (Who's there?)
Speak down on my gospel
To get beat down by my postals
Show these weak clowns that we hostile
Not docile, volatile
If you become an obstacle, it's in my way, it's probable
You'll end up in a hospital
12 planets, 12 disciples
The sun in the middle of the feral cycle
The one individual comparing the bible
To the likeness, appearance, and the works of Michael
Wears a red cross so be prepared to be rivaled by a movement
That'll make you stop and stare at its title
MJWYJ, a repetitive check, an even better recital
It's time to let the truth out
Bring the troops out and get the nukes out and have a shootout
Let's see who about that life and got true clout
Me and Ace good like ace hoods
Fallen diamonds, we falling stars
It's unreal what people calling art
Yet they fall apart when we spar with bars

[Hook]
