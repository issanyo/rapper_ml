[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
I'm a bit perplexed by the people with nothing better to do than talk that shit
Acting like a little vagina's smiling in ya face than climb in it, the climate of a hymen is so dry inside, you can't hide in it, everybody knows that you let your girl beat you down there ain't no denying it
You still my fan wannabe man boy all alone in your one-room house, painting my chest dressed out from all of the red tape should've put the tape all over your sin bitch mouth
(I'm a scapegoat from a local band on fiend-its who wanna get fame)
Fell into a frame and a little bit of game back in the day now they need someone to blame
All you do start up your own family name wanting folks not to get jaded
Hey buddy, I'm the only one doing real tours and who's the one always faded
Gotta get the facts from a deep down bitch with big pink tits and she's whoring, and you're scoring cause she's whoring, you're ignoring the bigger picture
She's tryna keep that closet door closed, I'mma be in that horno, I got copies of all of her porno, she gon' rob me, even my sore foe
Those four bros I was down with but I already chose their fate (She got you to hate)
The people that love you the most, that's why I will never relay

[Hook]
It feels like I'm dying, living in a world where everyone is crying
It feels like I'm dying, living in a world where everyone is crying
It feels like I'm dying, living in a world where everyone is crying

[Verse 2:Twisted Insane]
I am the one that infects your brain, and relents the lames
And annex the games, so how are you gonna wait, the best don came
Get up in ya chest with pain, let everyone know I am the Root of Evil
All hail the Insane, let me up all under and lead the people
I am the nighttime demon, all these pretty bitches wanna suck my  semen
It's a nightmare, you ain't motherfucking dreaming, these bitches do really want it they be up all night demon
One little hit and I get em all Brainsick, two little dicks and I make em all just squirt
Pardon me y'all cause she really wanted a dick, now the cum's looking like mud in the dirt
I am the lord of the night, and I bite like I'm Dracula
I lurk in the darkness, and you never know when I'm coming after ya
I could be up under your fucking bed, I could be up hiding with a machete in the bushes
Ready to open your wife's legs, and see how far this here knife  pushes
Drunk at the show, drunk in the park, drunk in the car on the way home
You can call a nigga Swervy McGervy cause I was at a curve and I really should've stayed long
Feel a nigga with the pistol grip, fill a body with the wicked shit, underneath the moonlight with a shovel and a chainsaw
Get the body and I'm digging shit (mothafucka)

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
When I wake up tonight and step out my coffin, feel that liquid in ya coughing sloshing, now that I get to dropping and popping, smoke that weed when the kush is cropping, feels like I'm dyin cause everybody be saying that the world is coming to another end
I don't wanna hear it, I don't want an empty soul and we're the ones out of control
So much wasted time and many to foe
Get it right now when you're ripe and young
Empty wedge so bite your tongue
Influenza feels right to some
Making you think the sun got AIDS, so we get a little bit more of that earth to run, but ya oughta be methodically optimizing artery purgery running through your veins
So urgently that the surgery on the urban street
Hoping that the cops don't murder me in the 3rd degree and they'll probably get away with it
This is an emergency and they did it, say that it wasn't self-defense
But they craving a freight of everybody, even they momma betrayed
Bringing that drama, dominate propagate
Heaven is a monopoly properly put into its place
Better face the fact from wasted wax from candles that burn the skin of innocent people seeking a resolve and a way out, that'll never be solved

[Hook]
