[Verse 1]
I hit the dance floor running
Ain't nobody stopping me from getting the party popping I get 'em up in the air
The people in front of me back of me side of me everybody coming together as one
Even the bartender leaving the margarine she got a high tolerance we don't even care
(Everyone is ready to have some fun)
Little bit of whiskey to wash it out, feeling myself I'm blocking it out, living in the moment you're never gonna find another opponent like me I'm rocking out C'mon!

[Hook]
While everybody's sleeping, it's a bloodbath and everyday's the weekend
(I hit the dance floor running)
While everybody's sleeping, it's a bloodbath and everyday's the weekend
(Everyone is ready to have some fun...)

[Verse 2]
I  know who I am, nothing new to me, you can't stop it
I rhyme for the ones who rule the art and say fuck the profit
You bitch about a function where you can't do what you say
I dream about a world where we elevate and we smoke a blunt
I a nest of nature, working to preserve this eclectic flavor, my pen & paper is legislature, an eminent feminist condemning the evidence give us a stomach with credit, I'm doing it for the hell of it, I'm a different pedigree
Even ya bottle of Hennessy remembers me
Acting all sad like it's a rosary, get up off of the fucking wall like you're supposed to be, c'mon
QUIT BITCHING AND SNITCHING YOU MOTHERFUCKERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE LIVING RIGHT
Life is short like a Hitler mustache I must ask you one question, Do you wanna die a lonely man with contraband a master plan and no friends no family no zen?
Everybody worries but worry will hurry and ruin and deteriorate your best hand
I'm kick back at the [?], living in the moment cause chilling is free, if you're a hater you can hit the door and walk it out cause you don't mean shit to me
I'm a monster, but I got feelings too
I'm just not feeling you, I got a colorful cast of characters in my cathedral for you

[Hook]
