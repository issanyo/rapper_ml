You're a Stranger (repeat)

[Verse 1]
My dad taught me not to talk to strangers
So glad cuz there the worse manipulators
The manuscript of a Hater
Motha fuckas wanna act like they my friend
But the pent up anger
Is so obvious
The one that needs an optometrist
Now who’s the ominous
My Systems down
All the energy that I'm soaking up now
I wouldn’t get in the way of my Zen & Tao
Not that you even know how to Bow
No wonder you took the bitch route
With your fake smile
Nothing more to me than a paypal Orderlys
Take orders and absorbing me
But i give no sorcery
Didn’t wanna leave you in the dust
Didn’t want chill with you on the bus
I'm the motha fucka that shoulda put you under the ground
Instead of introing you to my sound
You are the clown riding my nut because i bust
On the cusp and so you thrust
Fuck the fuss
Brain Candy
Come Handle Me
I roll with family you're a

Verse 2:
I'ma trust that all of you know when I meet ya
I won’t remember ya name
I'm not a computer game
I'm more than a creature of the night
Ima eat ya than I might
Don’t get mad if I bite
Ima bring you BACK, to my tomb for a delicious delight
Ima sight for soar pipe under the pale moonlight
The Ripeness of the Nectar
A lie Detector, I dissect ya thoughts the
Mind erector
Find and catcher
That's a dime to get slime injected
I don’t wanna leave it for someone else to be hitting it
Then its Grime Infected
In time I become benign reflective
Kinda rejected the detective part of me
When the third eye artery
This is just the start of me
Better feelin than winning the lottery
Penetrating the whole like sodomy
In bed witer but she’s calling V
I don’t even know this woman odd to be?
