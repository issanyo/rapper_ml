[Intro]
I'm feeling trapped in, feeling like you're trapped in

[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
She don't like what I bring to the table, now that bitch eats alone
Panicking hoping nobody finds her phone, a mannequin planet you are a fake little clone
But I've been here before, this is a pattern that hinders my growth
She takes and she takes and they turn to embrace my mistakes to erase but they filled up with hate when I started to blow
Here take this pill
But aim to the face will erase ill will, I was displaced since birth, born to decay in the Earth no chill, caught in the hornet's nested orbit, caught in the webs of the story, spot and sold for the glory, left you for something new and so boring, that shit is slimy, are all friends grimy, but they know the truth
I'm in the booth with a noose around my neck, I'm living proof that she's here to cash my check, I give her two but she's here to slash my best
Her breezy excursion, my name in her mouth everyday she ain't learning, that's why you got left in the dust and it's burning
So let me make it ever so clear, no God no more living in fear

[Hook: Kung Fu Vampire]
Get your mind numb, time to fly I'm tiresome
I'm losing fights with myself (I'm feeling trapped in here)
Suicidal thoughts, time to finalize my plots, abusing all of my wealth (feeling like you're trapped in Hell)
Get your mind numb, time to fly I'm tiresome
I'm winning fights with myself (I'm feeling trapped in here)
Suicidal thoughts, fuck that it's time to plot, too much love for myself (now I'm crawling out of Hell)

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Trapped in the dark (in the dark)
Love lost, a collapse in the heart
From the start, had a passion for art couldn't pass who they gas when I spazz from the start
Ran fast like fame's been the same, chasing hoes and my soul that remains
Auto-pilot as I stroll through the day, convo with the bros but I hold in the pain
Feel like I got hit by a train, I indulge in the drink the liquor is in my veins
Chilling with a chick that I met at the club, take her home then I fuck, Ion even know her name
Damn, and the cycles repeat, most nights I can't even sleep, I was tryna be living my dreams, running through quicks and I sing
That was 2014 and a nigga made it out, 4 years later homie look at the account, knew that I could get it, a nigga was independent, had to work a little different just to get a quicker route
Now you probably see me living with a smile, was bout to throw in the towel til I figured it out
Nothing about the clout, it's all about who you with, only rock with my clique and everyone in the crowd
