[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
There's a major breach in the world and we are it
A malfunctioning destructive blip-on a radar?
People put they panties in a bunch, Imna give um lip
They slit they wrists in hopes to fix technology
Fuckboy in a brothel, psychology says, we are a product of our environment there's a hole in the ozone, radiation leaking in your fish and in your home, and the birds are chirping out front, but around the corner, there's a cop killin these niggas for smoking a blunt and being different
Shiftin, fuck face like on the bat of Bill Ripken
Here is a note to the little boys and girls of the world
Love everyday like it is your last, never look back at the past
Fuck faith, you don't know the half, we ain't livin, we leavin a carbon footprint
Snapchat, new app bitch, where we at?
On a floating rock in a space, where monkey became humans, humans consuming is dooming Mother Earth for the purpose of gettin more cars, boats, and hoes
Overpriced garbage like Kanye's clothesline, just try to approach mine and danger happens
Shit will go beyond rapping, it'll get graphic, and wrapped in plastic
I'm the one laughing at your funeral that quick
This is a global scale version of Waco
You're better off drinking that purple drink when they say so
You go on ahead and admit that it tastes great, smile for the camera then wake up
The emperor is doing your makeup, they get mad if I say some

[Hook]
And you wonder why the world is so cold (Bow to the Emperor)
And you wonder why the world is so cold (Bow to the Emperor)
And you worship me (Bow to the Emperor)
And you worship me (Bow to the Emperor)

[Verse 2:The R.O.C.]
Hey, where are the puppet strings?
Need to cut 'em off to see what the world brings
Man, just lies to me
Man, despises me
Runnin' our lives who lives and who dies of course
Tryna devise a plan to entice the poor, into being better victims
System sicks 'em catch then fish them, back in the poverty state
Awake the souless gates can't wait for Hell to penetrate then waste no place for what's yo race
Excepts humans in a mosh pit desire, rapid retire, the planets drifting towards fire
Hell and brimstone ain't much but hatred in ourselves
Jail wit cells only feed you what they sell, is bullshit, pulpits, most intents to lynch wisdom keep us
Stupid criticism they flinch
The bastards they are, oh where is the bar
They hide it so we can not reach it so far
I scream at the stars, who listens no pause, never let up on y'all, cause this world is so scarred
Their brains are ajar, the baggage break laws, they make up we follow my keys to my car
So I can drive right thru they face and they cause
No beep out for murder cause they deserve more
Then death at they corner, no one's left to mourn ya
I speed out won't warn 'em, the people's now on 'em
Now see you're a goner for killin our senses, what they do is senseless, we run for the fences, it's war in they vision, we have to suspend them
From ribs hooks incisions, bleed out loss of feeling, the scale tip we get 'em
Diabolical in 'em, 123, we sendin a message, now finish 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
One time had a fun time at my front door when they manipulated their way in
Lookin at me for a conviction, we didn't murder him
But we almost ended up in the federal pen, flirting with a judicial system, within a week they try to break down my alibi, even tried to televise
So they can persuade the jury and judge, the good people of San Jose thinking I am a killer cuz I'm selling good bud
And gotta couple guns, gotta couple of friends that's done a couple of things, took some laws and bent 'em up
It's like the continent has a parallel universe a different version of our stories but they interrupt
And get intercepted by a club of pigs with more money than you
The best honeys and a cure for aids, on the fake news
Is this the onion dude? I'm highly confused, nobody givin a fuck what Confucius says
Worshippin a false god, we blamin everybody, every politicer is a joke, Republican partly hardly Democratic, a neurotic November we didn't vote for nothing we fight for something
How the fuck is Donald Trump close to being the president, we got plenty of evidence more damage to the reputation of the American people
I'mma gain some revenue, the reverend is ready to jump off the steeple

[Hook]
