[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
Which one of you snorts that blow
Nowadays you just never know
Everyone is seeking for that late night glow
Staying up all night to relieve that snow
Tunnel vision but that act has risen
Re-animated but I'm back on a mission
When the sun lights hits and your back is fizzing
That's vamp masochism and plastic prisms
Get smashed into compact active rhythm
I have to give em a dose so big that they have to listen
They jaw jack never outlast the fast position
And that sass will get you a blasted kitchen
Hit you wit a 50 yard dash dirt snatch rash incision
I crash divisions
Not leaving anyone of 'em eaten their own guts
When you clash precision
The immortal mortician with a portal of important immoral decisions
A cash advance then a mass collision
At ya catechism practice jizzing
Here's a bit of enlightening news
If you wanna go for late night cruise
You could see the way that these tweakers bruise
Or you could choose to wear cement shoes
Seamen will find you, may I remind you
That I'm right behind you breaking your bad habits
Mistaken me for pragmatic
The heat from the sun won't blind you
Deceit and the one that minds you burning the bridge
Earn there respect or whatever that is, waken the kids

[Hook] (x2)
I’m Knockturnal
Knock knock knock knock
I keep on hearing that
I keep on feeling that
I keep on hearing that BOOM

[Verse 2: Rap is a Joke]
Which one of you smokes that pipe? deities will keep you up all night
Like a hockey player spending all the time on ice
[?]
I know, Imma get a little dope from my old crack ho and she looking for some mo, blow, and I'm cold, just gotta let you know

[Hook] (x2)
I’m Knockturnal
Knock knock knock knock
I keep on hearing that
I keep on feeling that
I keep on hearing that BOOM

[Verse 3: Kung Fu Vampire]
I am colossal, OG fossil, walking Apostle
Stalking a brothel
To find my next meal and I'm off in a gospel
Singing a choir to a sea of liars
In dire straights, I admire fates
They ain't checking ID’s at the iron gate
You taste a bit synthetic
If I check ya background I bet you ain't ready
We all could you use, a little Buddha in life
But we ruin the vibe
When we put two in the sky
Could be sav noir but you abuse the ice
So sad you are (down note) but you could pay price
Magic scars sergeant at arms
Choosing my next victim from a far
No abatement I bet you won't escape the rapine
Running for your car but I'm already chasing
A creature of Habit
When I'm facing a life of eternal damnation
A recreation of events
Cuz in my psyche they made sense
An innovator on the edge of the fence
I love turning white sheets red
I ain't against revenge
Especially…when the pheromones
Get next to me
The new Hugh Heff with a recipe
The blue moon sets for the Undead Referee
So best to be eternally on ecstasy
A masterpiece, it has to be
A midnight masochist
This is the ending but there is a twist
Now you get to make a wish!

[Hook] (x2)
