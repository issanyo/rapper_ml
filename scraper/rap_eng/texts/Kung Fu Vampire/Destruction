[Verse 1]
I am God
I'm taking away the freedom of innocent human
To protect the lining in your pocket
It's odd
Underneath the world is the politician, the rapture, the beast the facade
And I am told
That the One and Only is here, maybe showing love but he's strikes with fear
And ahhh
Your favorite daddy in the sky is laughing at you while he's watching you fall
It's coming alive and your mind is fig-a-ment
Of whatever the pigament on your retina scan
See's in the distant land
Stainin' your brainin' aimin' to leave ya alone leavin' you hangin' amen
For the perfect parts to twist and mold
And feel like it's driving you insane behold
The hand that's rocking the cradle is labeled ice cold
And so I'm told
I'm systematic and I'm pro creation
A diplomat, I seek sex sensation
Abuse my relationships with Haitians
Murderous prophecy to infect a nation
I'm on every radio station, waiting and hating!
AM/FM see me escaping, the question is: do you got answers?
My blood pumps poison with deadly cancer

[Hook]
Point your fingers to the sky
The sky is a goddamn lie
We can all survive
I just can't
Look for destruction

[Verse 2]
I'm the devil
The one only one to stand up for what I believe in
A true rebel with a cause
There's several with flaws
Jesus, Buddha, the holy Koran (Allah)
Karma strikes
And I alter your life
If I want your wife she'll sip the sickness
Griping the witness, bare knuckle fitness
With a quickness disintegrated inflict this with the pleasurable pain
Keeping ya highly medicated yet letting the evil reign
Sadistic in his views but a little more sane
Satanic and confused what a pity the brain that's wasted
Even Saddam can taste it
Stay high I'm Satan, sorta got a little of pull but I ainâ€™t waiting
I'm hired by raping, a million in dire straighten
Liars entire states got me firing wires across the mires of higher lakes
They hiring me as a sire to inspire fate
When I'm eyeing the lion's gate, admiring time and place I'm a sub primate
With a blank iron face, and I sank to disgrace
When you dropped from the heavens and invad my space
Fuck your beliefs and your alien race

[Hook]
Point your fingers to the sky
The sky is a goddamn lie
We can all survive
I just can't
Look for destruction
