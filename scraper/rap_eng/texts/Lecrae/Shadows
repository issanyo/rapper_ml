[Verse: David Crowder]
Life is full
Of light and shadow
Oh the joy
And oh the sorrow
Oh the sorrow

[Pre-Hook: David Crowder]
And yet will He bring
Dark to light
And yet will He bring
Day from night

[Hook: David Crowder]
When shadows fall on us
We will not fear
We will remember
When darkness falls on us
We will not fear
We will remember
When all seems lost
When we're thrown and we're tossed
We remember the cost
We rest in Him
The shadow of the cross

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
With every breathe I take
Every heartbeat
Sunrise and the moon lights in the dark street
Every glance, every dance, every note of a song
All of I give for this Earth that I shouldn't of known
Every moment I lie, every moment I covet
I'm deserving to die, I'm earning Your judgement
Ah, without the cross there's only condemnation
If Jesus wasn't executed there's no celebration
So in times of the good, and times of the bad
For any time I had it all, I will be glad
I will boast in the cross, I'll boast in His Name
I'll boast in the sunshine, I'll boast His reign
What's my life if it's not praising You
Another dollar in my bank account of vain pursuit
I do not count my life as any value or precious at all
Let me finish my race
Let me answer your call
Yep

[Hook] (x2)
