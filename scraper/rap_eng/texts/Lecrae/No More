Verse 1:
Dog I remember thirsting for God wanting that sweet communion, on and on my soul was longing for us to live this union
Wanted nothing else in life except to just be with Him, felt like nothing in this world could ever compete with Him
But I'm in college now (college now) trying to walk this out (walk this out) but it's harder now (harder now) can I talk to y'all? (talk to y'all)
I got caught in this mess yearning to walk in the flesh and thirst for Him less watching her walk in that dress
I saw the cross and how it took me from the worldly things and how He told me to count loss the dross and earthly things
I know I wanna sin (hey) but dog I'm born again (hey) and by His grace He displaced my disgrace and now it's on again
So I'm a buffet my body make it my slave man crucify my flesh daily til I see my grave man
I'm a fight and your games I won't play them no more, to the world listen up, we fed up, we not gon take this no more

Hook:
We not gon take it no more (8x)

Verse 2 (Lecrae):
No more hang time or playing time, man it's about to be game time, I hate you sin you quench the Spirit, done them both at the same time
First you holla ride with us then my flesh start to rising up this why 1 Corinthians was talking about all that dying stuff
Sick of heartache sick of pain sick of you I gotta quit this man, but me in my flesh can do nothing without the Spirit man
Eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard of the things revealed (revealed), by the Spirit dwelling within me through which I'm sealed
I no longer belong to you, I'm not holding on to you, I fight with all this might through every night that I long for you
I wrote this here song for you, My hatred is strong for you my love for God is greater than the lusts that I owned for you
Cause everything's wrong with you, the world wanna roll with you instead of you slaving me the Holy Spirit's controlling you
And this here I know is true the scriptures are showing you, since I belong to Christ I ain't gon take this no more from you

Hook:
We not gon take it no more (8x)


Bridge:
We ain't no slave to sin, we ain't no slave to sin, we not gon take it no more because we born again (4x)
