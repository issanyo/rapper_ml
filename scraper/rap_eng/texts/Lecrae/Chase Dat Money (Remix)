[Intro]
Yeah
What up west coast?

[Verse 1]
What up south east? (Daygo)
Raised me to be a lil' beast (yeah)
Caught a couple fades in the streets (what?)
Played on the beach (uh)
Playin' records with my uncle, Keith
I hit the fam all for the beats (yeah)
I'm rollin' down Imperial (Imperial)
Old school in my stereo (woo)
From Skyline, you don't hear me, though (Skyline)
I took a road trip to Long Beach, hit the wrong street
And they bang on you ("Where you from?")
But I'm good, I know [?]
Got a cousin off [?], though
Yeah, that's Compton, where they can hideout when the sun low
Visit greats down in South Bay (what up Steve?)
Ate good, thank God for the people in the hood
I grew up in the 90s (90s)
Peter Pan Ave., you could find me (yeah)
Posted with my cousin right behind me (huh)
Every single summer I was lookin' for the come up in that southern California sun bright enough to blind me (bling!)
