I see what you saying, cuz, but ain't nobody gon' go for this dawg - ain't nobody looking for this stuff. You know what I'm saying, you ain't gon' make no money off of it - nuthin'

[Lecrae]
Right, right, I feel what you saying dude - but you know what, you got a good point. I may not make a dime off of this. But that's not the point - you know what I'm saying? It's kind of like telling the pastor not to preach the sermon because, you know what I'm saying, the congregation may not give that Sunday, and it's just kinda like, man the point of it is is that I've got the truth. You know what I'm saying? It's not a truth, it's not what I deem to be a truth, it's the truth. I've got the Gospel, man, and it's what people need and so it's my responsibility as a believer to put it out there regardless of if I make a dime off of it or if anybody caught the album - you know what I'm saying? It's The Great Commission - so be it
