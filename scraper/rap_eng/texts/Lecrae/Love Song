Where would I be if I never met your love
Can't imagine ever gettin up
Without knowin your grace how you placed me in your righteousness
I can't get enough

Unconditional love is what you show me
In a world so cold and lonely
And the life that I'm livin was givin not based on me
But based on the fact you know me

You... Interceeded on my behalf
You... Gimme everything that I have
You... Never leave me alone my sins I been told
Cause you can no longer take on my wrath

You been so true so faithful
For your word I'm so grateful
Your love is true
And not what they showing on cable, and I'm

So in love with your righteousness I fight to just
Keep you in my sight for just
Five seconds of my life since the day I met Christ
Never knew a love quite like this, I'm writin this

With tears on my face you was there for my grace
Cause a father wouldn't hear my case
I was dead in my sins but you bled for my sins
That's the best kind of love anybody can taste

Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love

Verse 2 Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Love me Lord you sho do
I done lied and cheated and cheated and lied
And treated the lies as if they was true but

Metaphorically you broke my legs
Like a sheppard does his sheep when it misbehaves
Not to hurt me but to work me
Into the man that you need me to be today, And it's sweet to say

Even when I'm doin back I'm good
Work for the Lord I'm glad I could
Tell me you would give the son and die for the sins of the world
My daddy would

That's a love like no other
Not my father not my mother not my sister not my brother nope not at all
Forget material things, I got every spiritual blessing in Christ
Eternal life, ya I got it all

Fall deeper in love with you everyday
No longer there so I know you hear me when I pray
And you show me your wisdom in many ways
66 books to keep me amazed

Only your heavenly love can manifest
In the death and resurrection
Your affection is sheer perfection
Divine election, you give me direction

Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love

Only your love can save somebody just like me
Was tempted just like me
But never gave in unlike me
I'm blown away

I never understood the kinda love that
Make somebody die for our world
Who doesn't even care that you cry for the world
Who doesn't care that you gave your life for the world

We do you dirty Lord, we not worthy Lord
Of your goodness and your mercy Lord
It hurts me that we remain to flirt with life that we got, to my Christ
So earthy Lord

Your love you know it rains
One day we'll see it plain
That to live as Christ and to die is gain
So keep all the fortune forget the fame man

We need the love of Jesus
Ha, that name Jesus
I could say it all day, I be in a daze
Your love is amazin like man Jesus

Your love's true and sincere
I reference you in fear
And as long as I'm around I'm down
To make sure the peopl hear

Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love with everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love
