[Verse 1: B. Reith]
6 A.M., she hits the snooze button
The thought of wakin' up makes her numb, she can't move nothin'
Pops a couple pills, thinkin it might ease the sufferin'
Numbs the pain but leaves the disease untouched
Plus now she's cuttin
Tried to live for what the world told her to, but ended up empty in the gut
Now she's cravin' for more
Sick to her stomach
Hates how she looks so she overeats and vomits
And that's just a half
Cause her mom and her dad won't
Give her the attention that she needs cause they'd rather
Focus on their jobs and climb the corporate ladder
Which basically tells their daughter that she doesn't matter
Her heart's shattered
Glass is half-empty
Tries to find a reason to live, can't think of any
But deep underneath the confusion and lies
She knows she was made to live for more than suicide
It's do or die time, she chooses option one
Rises up, sings this anthem from the bottom of her lungs

[Chorus: Lisa Gungor]
We were made to be more than this
Oh, and we weren't meant to fight wars like this
Something's gone wrong
We've been broken
Who can fix us now, fix us now
We were made out of love not hate
Oh, and we weren't meant to to give up on faith
Something's gone wrong
We've been broken
Who can fix us now, fix us now

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Johnny started getting pushed by the bigger kids
Took mamma's closed fist for every little thing he did
When he was younger, used to punch his little brother
Johnny's mad at the world and the pain that he was under
It got worse when momma's boyfriend was over, who was far beyond sober, with a chip up on his shoulder
Fightin' Jonny's mother so he tries to help mommy
Now he's in the hospital, broken limbs on his body
He hates people, hates family, hates school
He's plannin' hate crimes to make them all pay dues
Who can he trust
Is everybody out to hurt him
He'll just make them hurt first so he ain't got to wonder
This pain, deeper than the joints in his body
He planned to go to school and let it loose in the lobby
Missed the hugs from his mommy
Needed love from his daddy
Never knew that there was hope to end the pain in his family
Then someone told him 'bout the risin' of the son
Now Johnny quit lookin' for a gun. Done

[Chorus: Lisa Grungor]
We were made to be more than this
Oh, and we weren't made to fight wars like this
Something's gone wrong
We've been broken
Who can fix us now, fix us now
We were made out of love not hate
Oh, and we weren't meant to to give up on faith
Something's gone wrong
We've been broken
Who can fix us now, fix us now

Who can save us now (who can save us now)
Who can save us now (we're running out of breath, the end is counting down, oh)
Who can save us now
Who can save us now (who can save us now)
The one who conquered death can raise us from the ground, oh
We were made for more than this, oh
We were made
We were made [x8]
