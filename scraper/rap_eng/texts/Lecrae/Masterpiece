[Intro: Choir & Tori Kelly]
(Ooh)
It's so crazy to me
(Ooh)
How mistakes can be
(Ooh)
A blessing in disguise
(Ooh)
Lord, I'm so glad You're making me
A masterpiece
(Masterpiece) (oh Lord)

[Verse 1: Tori Kelly & Kirk Franklin]
(Hit me!)
When You look at me
Do You see a work of art in the making?
A sketch of what I'll be
I wonder what You see in me
Like what do You think?
When my life is not a melody in the morning
And I feel off key, yeah
Do You still believe in me?
Like a symphony, hey
You know how to make all things work together
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
That's why tonight I pray
Don't take Your love away
Forever in Your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no end
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece

[Verse 2: Tori Kelly]
When You look at me
Do I make You smile at what You're creating?
Working patiently with me
Appreciate that I am worth Your time
'Cause I wanna be, aye
Be the stone that You turned into Your treasure
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
That's why tonight I pray
Don't take Your love away
Forever in Your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no end
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece

[Post-Chorus]
It's what I wanna be

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Choir]
So I pray, don't take Your love away
Forever in Your embrace
Without You I'm like a storm with no end
Tossed by the wind and sea
And when I'm incomplete
Just one request from me
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Uh, now you know that you're a masterpiece
You probably feel like a catastrophe
You in the mirror everyday saying "uh" like Master P
Ain't really how it have to be
Now hold up (listen)
You acting totally different
You got a whole new position
You are the Ronnie Bobby Ricky whole New Edition
You think I'm totally kidding but hold up a minute
Don't compare yourself with none of them
You one of one and ain't no synonym
A Master Artist take a mess and make a masterpiece
And look at you, you been a gem (facts)
You Shinin'

[Outro]
God take my heart forever, it's Yours
Make me Your masterpiece
Oh oh
Make me Your...
Your masterpiece
