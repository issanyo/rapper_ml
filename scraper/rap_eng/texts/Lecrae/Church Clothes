[Intro]
One time for H-Town
One time for D-Town
One time for A-Town, M-Town

[Verse: Lecrae]
R.I.P. to Medgar Evers, R.I.P. to Dr. King
I ain't tryna' hate on my own kind
But Al and Jesse don't speak for me
I'm probably gon' catch some flack man
But I'm-a swallow this pill like Pacman
Some of these folks won't tell the truth
Too busy tryna get them racks man
Church tryna rob my paychecks
Choir members probably having gay sex
Pastor manipulatin' hurtin' women
I wonder which she's gon' slay next
Bookstore pimpin' them hope books
Like God don't know how broke looks
And telling me that I'm gon' reap a mil'
If I sow into these low crooks
Plus I know ol' girl a freak
And how she singin' a solo
I walked in the church wit' a snapback
And they tellin' me that that's a "no-no"?
That's backwards, and I lack words
For these actors called pastors
All these folks is hypocrites
And that's why I ain't at church
Truthfully I'm just doin' me
And I don't wanna face no scrutiny
As long as the church keep wildin' out
I can justify all my foolish deeds
Smoking weed, pourin' up
Keep that lean up in my cup
Maybe I could change the world
But this porn on my laptop got me stuck
Yeah I know what's right from wrong
But that there ain't gon sell a song
I rather sell my soul then save it
If that's what make my money long
It better not be no real God
With real hope, that heals hearts
That shows me that I ain't livin' up
To all the things that He put me here for
It better not be no real church
Real saints, who pray hard
And let me rock my snapback
With the 501's and the J's on
It better not be no real folk
Who don't think that they better than you
Straight or gay, drunk and high
They walk through the cold and weather wit' 'chu
'Nah we don't wanna see that
Cause that might mean "life change"
That might mean I'm worth more than money, cars, sex, and pipe dreams
Better not be no real Jesus, real forgiveness, for hurt folks
If God gon' take me as I am I guess I already got on my church clothes
