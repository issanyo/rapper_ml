[Intro]
And we believe where two or three gather in your name (you're there)
And so now we live expecting to see God

[Hook: Tye Tribbett]
Aye yo
We came through the door
Looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall
We came through the door
Looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall

[Verse 1: Michelle Williams:]
Lord anytime you wanna
So much has happened through this week
I’ve had a long one
The enemy. Yeah, he’s been on one
It’s like everyday he’s bringing me some drama
But just when I can’t take no more
You step in and show me I’m yours
Tonight, come boldly
Knowing that there's victory here for me

[Bridge: Michelle Willams]
And we believe, where two or three
Gather in your name, you're there
And so now we live expecting to see
The power of God reigning here

[Pre-Chorus: Michelle Williams]
So, Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
So, Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)

[Hook: Tye Tribbett]
Aye yo
We came through the
Door looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall
We came through the door
Looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall

[Verse 2: Michelle Williams]
Everything you have for me
Healing, favor, let it be
On earth, Like it’s in heaven
Let it shower down on me
I need your blessings

[Bridge: Michelle Williams]
And we believe where two or three
Gather in your name (you're there)
And so now we live expecting to see
The power of God reigning here

[Pre-Chorus]
So, Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
(Hey, Michelle let me holler at them real quick.)
I need your presence
You're omnipresent
You never leave nor forsake us
You give us plenty blessings
You know when they say two or three get together your presence is here forever
But truthfully we know better
That scripture mean you agree with the discipline
But we tired of getting beat up
Similar to the King
Like Rodney, like Martin, Like Christ on that cross
We praying that your glory falls
Lord thank you for your gospel

[Pre Chorus: Michelle Williams]
And we believe when two or three gather in your name (your name)
And so now we live expecting to see
The power of God reigning here

[Pre-Chorus]
So, Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
I wanna see it fall. (oohhh)
Lord let your glory fall down
We wanna see it fall. (oohhh)

[Hook: Tye Tribbet]
Aye yo
We came through the door looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall
We came through the door looking for a miracle
So show us who you are
Lord let your glory fall
