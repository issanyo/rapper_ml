[Intro: Lecrae]
Nothin but a...
Nothin but a...
Nothin but a...
Nothin but a

[Hook: Lecrae]
Problem, Problem
Nothin but a problem (x4)

[Verse 1: Chad Jones]
Mobbin, Mobbin
You know I brought the squad out
Been the missing link, off the chain
Doghouse
Eleven six and you know that's what talkin' bout
Yao to the Ming, I'm gassing timeout
Late night we working til the AM
Work don't stop till the song cause mayhem
Go toes if you don't like our mission
Then I see you if you mobile and you listen in
You Finna K.O?
Nah I ain't think so
You say I'm down with problems
Now you gotta go an take on Chad Jones
Watch me psycho
Cuz we gone make moves all the way to the bay tho

[Hook: Lecrae] (x2)

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
Woah there
Why yall even even go there?
I'm just tryin' to function too yal be like no fair
We don't want no problems see
Keep ya name out the obituary column sheet
This is Art out struggle, real life scrapper bike
Pch east los to east bay all
Raider nation
The west coast native killa Cali bread big homie
In and Out, Rascos, 50 cent tacos
We ain't tryin' take ya lane mane
Just run in ours, an run in bars
Wit killa bars
I'm from where they need hope
Cause' all the see loc, is
White tees, dickies, palm trees and weed smoke

[Hook: Lecrae] (x2)
You need me around though

[Verse 3: Canon]
I'm a menace been a problem
Started from the bottom
I ain't the type to rock alligators and ties around my collar get it clear just like that vodka
Popular or unpopular
Prop'll a put you in check properly pop and imposter
While I been popping a bottle
That Pellegrino my option
I a need a mad haven just to understand my conscience
I been a loose canon, jack a beat, I'm still a rebel
The swagger savvy trigger happy who chained to the ghetto
And no ain't settle
Was saved in the hood
I done had my dark nights
And lucky I ain't seen suge
Suburbans don't understand me
I know they wish they could
I'm just product of salvation check up under my hood
Tell ya vatos I'm a problem

[Hook: Lecrae] (x2)
You need me around though
