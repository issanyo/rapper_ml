[Verse 1: MIKESCHAIR]
Something here is wrong
There are children without homes
But we just move along
To take care of our own
There's so much suffering
Just outside our door
A cry so deafening
Oh, we just can't ignore

[Chorus: MIKESCHAIR]
To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding on to love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

[Verse 2: MIKESCHAIR]
Take a look around
Before the sun goes out
What's lost can still be found
It's not too late now
It only takes one spark
To make the fire burn
So reach inside your heart
And let this be the start!

[Chorus: MIKESCHAIR]
To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding on to love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world
To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding on to love
All the people who are reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

[Bridge 1: Lecrae 2:00-2:17?]


[Bridge 2: MIKESCHAIR & Lecrae]
I see the sun coming up
It's a brighter day
Let's show the world that love...
Is a better way
So lend a hand join the fight
'Cause time is ticking away
I'll keep changing the world
I see the sun coming up
It's a brighter day
Let's show the world that love...
Is a better way
So lend a hand join the fight
'Cause time is ticking away
I'll keep changing the world

[Chorus: MIKESCHAIR]
To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding on to love
All the people who reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world
To all the people who are fighting for the broken
All the people who keep holding on to love
All the people who reaching for the lonely
Keep changing the world

[Outro: MIKESCHAIR & Lecrae]
I see you changing the world
I see you changing the world
Keep changing the world
I see you changing the world
Changing the world, changing the world
Keep changing the world
