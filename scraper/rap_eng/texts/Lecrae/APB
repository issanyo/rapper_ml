[Intro]
(Police Officer) Ten-Four Charlie
(Charlie) Go ahead
(Police Officer) Yeah I think we got a problem
(Charlie) Yup. That boy right there gone
G-g-g-good Work Charlie, hahahaha

[Chorus: Lecrae and Thi'sl]
Ten-Four Charlie I think we got a problem
That boy right there gone put an APB out on him
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he outta there
You seen him, he gone

[Verse 1: Thi'sl]
Saint Louis my city dog, west side, was the block
While you was in the crib playing with Legos
I was out there trying to get blocks
Momma gone, daddy gone, just me and my hood, dawg
SuWooping, beaned up, like I'm bout to go play baseball
Before you ever heard about Jeezy boy I was already on some Trap or Die
Was a goon, 'fore it was cool, You can still see the pain in my eyes
What you know about sitting in a jail cell, felonies, murder case
Best friend, rolled on me, take the stand, turned state
I am a felon, I tell no lie
Hand on the Bible, hand to the sky
I wanna live, I ain't wanna die
When they rolled upon me and let them bullets fly
That could have been the end, dawg
One way, Hell's gates
But the Lord stepped in, chose to show grace
Could have been laid in the box, dawg
6 of my homeboys carry me
But I'm alive and the old me gone
Cause everyday dawg I bury me

[Chorus: Lecrae and Thi'sl]
Ten-Four Charlie I think we got a problem
That boy right there gone put an APB out on him
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he outta there
You seen him, he gone
Ten-Four Charlie I think we got a problem
That boy right there gone put an APB out on him
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he gone
You seen him, he outta there
You seen him, he gone

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Ok, hydroponic lungs, top shelf liver
Limb a lil' tender, I can chop down timber
I was no pretender, certified offender, never know surrender
My amnesia's circumstantial, though some things I can't remember
Those who knew me be like "who he?", they tripping off the new me
They like "Man, where the old 'Crae? You crazy, you can't fool me
I would party so hard that the law was tryna find me
I pray to God they ain't find me But then I hear the {WHOOP-WHOOP}
Look up in the rear view and they're right behind me
Roll down my window- "Boy what's your name?
Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man"
Then I gave them my ID, and guess what they say
"This boy here crazy, naw that's just Crae"
Man I was psycho, wild as the hundreds
I do like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They like "man what you do? Something 'bout you just ain't the same"
I was dead. The old me was nothing but a sucker
Sucked the life out of my mother, just to get the stuff I wanted
Now I'm milk carton status and "different" can't explain it
Put the APB out on me, if they find me that's amazing
