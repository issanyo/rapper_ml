[Hook]
Why you let em get you like that
Why you let em treat you like that
Why you let em stone cold play you
He's a stone cold player
That's a no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
I heard he drive you crazy
But come on girl let's face it
He got your heart deceived
And you ain't thinking straight when
God love ya lady, you'll always be His baby
But you using your body, to go out and disgrace Him
You need to leave him shawty, and you should leave him shortly
After this message I'm guessing you think you need him shorty
No but you need God
Your heart to please God
It to be your satisfaction
Live to please God
He'll never lie to you
You know He's perfect, love
You know He died for you
He's got the perfect love
So gone let him go, go
Stickin with him is a no,no,no,no

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey, you know satan like to play you girl
Biting after the killings, trying to shake you girl
He's so pragmatic, so he's back at it
That's why you gotta flea temptation, tell him "you can have it"
He's a trickster, loves to tell you that you need sin
Make you think you still a slave when you a free men
Always scheming but don't be ignorant
And fall prey to the liar and the lion's den
If you wait till you're alone on a date night
To figure out what's wrong in the late night
It too late right
You got caught up again, and now you back in sin
Feel like you can't ever win
But that's the lie again
You gotta raise up
Knowing God is the only one who can save us
Satan played us
It shouldn't amaze us
Crafty, takin' advantage of the way we crave lust

[Hook]

Ladies, if Song of Solomon had never been written
And you never saw how men were supposed to cherish their women
And look at Ephesians 5, where they nourish their wives
Is he really that type of guy or are you rationalizing
Our God deserves glory
Greatest of love stories
More than movies and TV believe me He knows your needs
He provided His only son
When we ain't deserve it
He loves you on your worst days
You know He's perfect
So hold on, wait, be content
You got the greatest
You single, give it away cause your life was made for the maker
But you got it, it's a gift don't waste that
Temptation be looking good don't taste that
I told you back in 05' you should have waited
Yeah waited
Yeah waited

[Interlude]
Ha, yeah, you remember wait?
Aye, if you looking for love, you need to find God

[Hook]
