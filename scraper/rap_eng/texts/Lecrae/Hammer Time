[Intro: Future]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Bedtime, I ain't never had a bedtime
Headline, boy, you lookin' at a headline
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Fed time, watch me kill the scene, fed time
Fed time, we gon' steal the scene, fed time

[Verse 1: 1K Phew]
I say "MC Hammer out the slammer, I'm set free for real"
Phew Montana ridin' through Atlanta, Jesus took the wheel
I can't keep the Truth inside of me, I gotta squeal
Some folks trust in God just 'cause the words on dollar bill
Aw man, He gon' touch back down and seal the deal
Y'all playin'
Sorry I can't understand a word that y'all sayin'
Big boss moves, never heard of small plans
I just want some acres, I come from a small land
Nah, for real, itty bitty
Used to be down, bad boy, now I'm up like Diddy
Got a new wave, and we surfin' through the city
Christ is walkin' wit' me, shinin' bright, we got it litty
Like "sheesh!"
Out the dog pound, we done made it off the leash
Makin' sure the people comprehend like "capiche!"
Young Georgia boy comin' straight up out the East
Grindin' 'cause my family gotta feast

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Bedtime, I ain't never had a bedtime
Headline, boy, you lookin' at a headline
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Fed time, watch me kill the scene, fed time
Fed time, we gon' steal the scene, fed time

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Hold up
Now tell me, who you foolin'?
Saw you coolin', flexin' with the jeweler
Whatchu doin'? You don't measure up, I met the Ruler
Closet full of Js, boy, you never been a shooter
And I don't need a chain, just to prove you, boy, I'm movin'
When you movin' out yo' mama house, off yo' mama couch?
If we livin' what we talk about, you don't talk a lot
Sound booth, rented Lambo, you can say that
Took my money, built a studio, and took the Range back
H-Town to Atlanta, country bama, MC Hammer
Boy, we too legit to quit, I die, I resurrect, ma√±ana
Put a nail up in your coffin, my hammer awesome
I ain't worried 'bout no pro'lems, the Lord I'll call on
My God!
Everybody eatin' if you part of my squad
And they know I'm workin', boy, I stay on my job
You know God my standard, He the answer
I ain't perfect, I'm just purchased, out here workin' with the hammer like

[Hook: 1K Phew]
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Bedtime, I ain't never had a bedtime
Headline, boy, you lookin' at a headline
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Hammer time, they can't touch me, hammer time
Fed time, watch me kill the scene, fed time
Fed time, we gon' steal the scene, fed time
