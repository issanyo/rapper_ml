[Intro: Lecrae]
It's like I
I can dream and even I know

[Hook: J. R.]
Life is to know You
But sometimes I doubt You
The noise all around me makes it harder to hear You
I know that I need You
So grace won't You rescue
This heart full of pride
Cause I'm nothing without You
I'm nothing without You

[Verse 1: J. R.]
It's another day
But the same old song
Put on my happy face
But I feel so alone
I wonder can they hear
The screams inside my heart (my heart)
How long can I pretend I
My face now torn apart

[Pre-Hook: J. R.]
How did I get here
I was so close to You (I was so close to You)
I walked away from all I know is true
But this I know (but this I know)
You're standing close (you're standing close)
Ready to heal my brokenness

[Hook]

[Verse 2: J. R.]
What do I do (what do I do)
Where can I go (where can I go)
To rest this weary soul
And drop this heavy load (drop this heavy load)
I miss Your company
The sound of Your voice
Your words brought life to my bones
A melody of joy

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I need You to guide my steps
I had cried, I wept
I tried my best
When I die I'll rest
I'm feeling like dying
I want to be used but I'm used up trying
Now I make a design but it's hard climbing on this hill (hard)
Miseducated about the Lords will
I'm seeing sin in me I go
When I pack my pride and forgot my hope I
Smiling at pictures worth a thousand words
If you knew nine hundred of them you'll be disturbed
I know praise God for the turn out
But spiritually I'm burned out
I just wanna run out (run out)
One season, is this an off one (an off one)
Cause I've been here too often (often)
Trying to preach the dead about better coffins
Relying on myself like my power is awesome

[Hook 2: J. R.]
Life is to know You
But sometimes I doubt You
The noise all around me (the noise all around me)
Makes it harder to hear You (harder to hear You)
I know that I need You
So grace won't You rescue (grace won't You rescue)
This heart full of pride
Cause I'm nothing without You
Life is to know You
But sometimes I doubt You (hey)
The noise all around me (the noise all around me)
Makes it harder to hear You (harder to hear You)
I know that I need You
So grace won't You rescue
This heart full of pride
Cause I'm nothing without You
(Cause I'm nothing without You)
I'm nothing without You
(I'm nothing without You)
Without You, without You, without You
I'm nothing without You, without You, without You
I'm nothing without You, without You, without You
I'm nothing without You, without You, without You
I'm nothing without You
