[Intro]
Tell that DJ to bang it (x8)

[Verse 1]
Boy I lost and I'm foolish, runni'g off at the two lips
Prolly wooing all the cruelest persecutors to fool us
Catch me hangin' with shooters rumored to strew your medulla
My momma told me they would screw us, but I already knew it
Who gon give 'em peace of mind, they can have piece of mine
Know they thinkin' I'm blind, but I just pay them no mind
Yeah I know they be lyin', they misquotin' my lines
They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes?
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines
Boy you trippin', 'Crae you slippin'
I done heard this all before, just sit back enjoy the show
Yeah, I know they gon' hate us
Type they blogs up, debate us
They be fishin' for attention but don't know how to bait us
Keep that hate on hiatus
Big ups to my creator
No big bang, just a banger, so tell that DJ to bang it!

[Hook]
Tell the DJ to bang it (x8)
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin' but I promise that I'm cool though
I know what they sayin', I ain't trippin' on it man
I just came to do my thing, something different for a change

[Verse 2]
Listen, I K-N-O, they tryna find out my MO
I tell 'em God sent me, they probably ain't get the memo, I know
I can't say that cause Jesus Walks, they don't play that, I know
Shouldn't be here cause people rollin' they trees here, I know
You can't help 'em, no strippers and killers welcome, I know
You can't hear it, no ignorance in my lyrics
Boy they swear I went loco, 1-1-6 still my logo
Catch us rollin' in that Volvo, gonna snap you a photo
Maybe Andy or PRo though, might see Trip in De Soto
Maybe KB, maybe T-Dot, yeah, I know you don't know though
Yeah, I know they don't like me, cause I be on my Spike Lee
Even when I do the right thing, they still wanna fight me
IRS want they taxes, police stop us in traffic
Plus my girl be on my back, she say my life is too hectic
'Crae they watchin' (I know)
Aye, they talkin' (I know)
I done seen this all before, man, it's just part of the show, let's go

[Hook]
