[Verse 1]
It's like I'm tired of life Lord I'm wrong why I can't get right
And when it's dark why I can't get light eh why it can't be light
It's so heavy why my sin won't let me see the end come get me
Please come get me my thoughts my mind my ways all evil
I'm supposed to be your people I'm sposed to see your sequel
I said I'll never leave you But I'm so left
I ain't right Lord I'm sleeping with death
I am cheating with death am I deaf Its like I don't hear you
I say that I'm a Christian but it's like I don't fear you
I'm on a selfish island and I am no where near you
God I really need you even tho I don't appear to
I'm drinking out a broken cistern
That could never hold water and I'm gonna get burned
Tho I try I never satisfy or quench this yearn
I hear you calling but it's like a fight for me to just turn
Lord I deserve to burn

[Hook]
Help me Lord before there's no time left
I ain't living I'm just breathing to death
Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest
Mine are evil and they lead me to death (2x)

[Verse 2]
I'm fellin' schizophrenic maybe I ain't saved
Cause I gotta get high just to block out all the pain
Seen death, seen hurt seen a whole lotta thangs
Instead of running from it I'm running away from change
It's like I'm outside in the ice cold weather
The rains coming down and I keep getting wetter
I know I'm getting sick and I could die any second
But still I refuse to let your truths make me better
I'd rather eat flies and maggots instead of bread
And it's killing me slow but I can't get it through my head
You were stabbed you were murdered and for me is why you bled
But I spit on your bloody face as If I never cared
And Lord how dare I compare my pain
Your father turned his back and you were left to hang
I don't know why you did it that I can't explain
How can you love this sinner whose desecrated your name?
Lord I deserve the flames

[Hook]
Help me Lord before there's no time left
I ain't living I'm just breathing to death
Your ways are perfect and they lead me to rest
Mine are evil and they lead me to death (2x)

[Verse 3]
I know I tell lies I know I do dirt
Apart from you I'm nothing but you can give me worth
I don't know if I know you But still I know I should
I know the days are evil and only you are Good
I've come to this conclusion I would like to change
Cause all the worlds money and fame cannot sustain
I know that I should turn but thats the hardest thang
Cause do I really feel that havin' Jesus is my gain
The world is so tempting Satan is a beast
He hypnotizes my eyes to say the least
But Jesus be my treasure to know you is live
And I am here dying trying everything there is
All I need here is you help me turn away from sin
Lord give me grace to turn away and the fear not to give in
I know that I'm not perfect but if I could rest in Him
I know I don't deserve it but still I'll take your hand
Lord let me take your hand
