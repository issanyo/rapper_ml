[Chorus]
Oh Lord
Gimme that God Almighty
That good old Gospel
That old school doctrine
Gimme that truth for the body
Ain't nothing new about it
But it's still full of power
Now church clap, let me hear the church clap (church clap) [x4]


[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Gimme dat, church mother and they church hat, clap
Man that Shug Avery Color Purple coming back, clap uhh
When that whole week beat you up and stress ya
But you hear that organ playing it remind ya of ya blessings
And on another note, she just hit another note
Chills down my spine, got me crying, make me over Lord
You don't know about us though, old school church hymms
Deacons get to humming now the drummer finna burst in
(Lordy, lordy, LORD) Can you hear me now
Church clothes sweaty, you don't care you just get it now
Testify, how we made martyrs outta these fathers
And rose up all of his daughters to glorify Him with honor
Man I swear I saw Miss Jones with her hair did
Now it's flying everywhere she don't care what her head did
She an heir, yea
Caught up in the air, yea
Probably why she clapping like Jesus just hear her prayer, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh Lord
Gimme that God almighty
That good old Gospel
That old school doctrine
Gimme that truth for the body
Ain't nothing new about it
But it's still full of power
Now church clap, let me hear the church clap (Church clap)
Church clap, church clap, church clap, church clap


[Verse 2: KB]
I wanna be the type of dude to get the Lord on his feet
I wanna do the type of shows that the Lord wanna see
And what I mean, if I could make the whole church clap
But ain't a clap in the heavens then that clap just a clap, clap
For the son glorified, sin mortified
The Holy Spirit's going where that truth ain't watered down
It sound doctrine, Spurgeon and common uh
Nothing wrong with singing loud but that ain't where the power's found
For too long the church churches been clappin' at weak sermons
Leaving the weak hurt, no one's changed by Sunday's service
We need discernment, check what you be affirming
Cause a church can be full of members but empty in conversions
Preach the gospel, and stand back
Look for changed lives not for hand claps
Love people well, oh they can't stand that
The church just a church when the word is where we stand at

[Chorus]
Oh Lord
Gimme that God Almighty
That old school Gospel
That old school doctrine
Gimme that truth for the body
Ain't nothing new about it
But it's still full of power
Now church clap, let me hear your church clap (Church clap)
Church clap, church clap, church clap, church clap
