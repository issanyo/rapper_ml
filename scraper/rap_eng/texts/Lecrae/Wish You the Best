[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Listen, look, I see you on IG
Your little man so big now
See you move to the west coast, and you done copped yourself a crib now
I'm sure by now you've moved on
I mean it's been some years since I left you in your bedroom wiping tears
I disappeared after I had met your momma now
And you met all my family too
They told us "love was complicated"
We told them "we gon' make it through"
But I blew it, I missed it, I didn't make you Mrs., I just made you miss us
I didn't put no ring on yo finger, but I did put you through the ringer
Yeah, I own that
Wish I could go back
Treat you right and take my wrongs back
But you should know that I

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
I wish you all the love you could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, now how we get this far?
Everything escalated
Late nights talkin' on the phone
Even with my situation, I'm so taken
But either way, I called you when you hit back
And we talked through all my dark times and you told me to just kick back
Lay on your shoulders
Know we friends but we closer
Thought that this could never work but I kept on walking that road
Maybe reconsider everything
Tell my girl we'll prolly never make it to the wedding day
I might not be ready, man
Oh, left her at the altar
Pretty sure I scarred her
And I hope that Heaven caught her
And I wish I never falter

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
And I wish her every joy she could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I know, I know I'm the reason you stopped believin' in love
'Cause the man I was that left you needin' more than I could ever be then
Crazy how everything's changed
Married now, I'm in a new space
And I heard you moved upstate
Well, I wish you the best always

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
