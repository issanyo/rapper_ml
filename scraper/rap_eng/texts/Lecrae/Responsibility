[Bridge: Sho Baraka]
Since the beginning
Man had a grind
So I figured out it's our time
Yeah, to have this mission on our mind
Trip, tell em' boys why you on on your grind

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
I,ll be on the grind
Been married for a little bit
My wifey on my mind, we walk together living it
(Trip do you take Jess?) She's a gift God delivered it
And Jess would take Trip like visitors, well grind then
Got a high call I lover her in his name
Gotta die for her (Like who?) Like The Risen King
Wish I was the perfect man, but I still be sinning man
That makes this picture incomplete, like it's missing frames
But natural ways are flawed, gotta go against the grain
Get that water of the word, drip it like it's pouring rain
(Listen) I be grinding for a lifetime, very long
We got that Superman love, (what?) very strong

[Hook: Trip Lee & Derek Minor]
I'll be on the grind, I'll on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I'll be on the grind
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
Now you can catch me going in
Got my focus on 10 boy
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
Got His mission on my mind
Man you can keep the shine
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind

[Bridge: Sho Baraka]
Since the beginning, man had a grind
So I figured out, it's our time
Yeah, to have his mission on our mind
'Crae tell 'em boys why you on your grind

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Hustle hard and fold them dollars, he don't even notice
That he got that tissue paper, all he ever do is blow it
As a christian I'm omission, yeah I stay up on my grind
It's some stuff I ain't buying, cause this money's not mine
I'll be on the grind, I-I-I'll be on the grind
I ain't talking rentals when I say that budget on my mind
Ten percent I do repent, I spend more than that on kicks
Wanna give my Father honor, He provide all that I get
You got plenty credit bills yet and still you don't sweat it
You don't see that you in debt, you just think that's extra credit
People dying for some lettuce, while we buying every fetish
We could show them Jesus better, instead of spending like a deader
Tell 'em

[Hook]

[Bridge: Sho Baraka]
Since the beginning, man had a grind
So I figured out, it's our time
Yeah, to have his mission on our mind
T-Dot go and tell 'em why you on your grind

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Man we so passive, we skip it
Sh-shifting blame, no transmission
No ownership like we rentin'
We let it go, and we quit it
Can't admit it, we did it, Make my mistakes and forget it
We only act like we're men, Somebody get 'em an Emmy
"Did I do that?", Making excuses for our actions
Man I keep it Ben Franklin, I ain't down with Andrew Jackson
Real men make mistakes, and they own up to 'em quickly
Real men take the heat, you can call it Dirk Nowitzki
And they do it cause He did it, motivated by the King
Moving every man by his hand, minus all the string
I'm living like He lived, yeah that's what I call a grind
And since he carried His, homeboy, I carry mine

[Hook]
