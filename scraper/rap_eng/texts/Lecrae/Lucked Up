[Chorus: Nija]
You lucked up on a real one, real one
Keep it one million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, yeah you
Lucked up on a real one, we just chillin'
Put you on a different feelin', one in a million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, you

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I lucked up on a real one
I lucked up and found real love
You been in it, you deserve to win it
I be curvin' women, I don't feel 'em
Ayy, I was trippin' on the road
I was 'bout to let it go
I got respect and now I'ma have to let 'em know
Girl, you water to my soul
Yeah, yeah, wooh
And catchin' plays is not an option
No discussion, change the topic
And you the first round draft
You the whole franchise and the top pick
Baby, I know that you know that I know you the truth (you know that, you know that, you know that)
And I can't believe that we done it the way that we do
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Nija]
Bet' be glad you lucked up on a real one, real one
Keep it one million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, yeah you
Lucked up on the real one, we just chillin'
Put you on a different feelin', one in a million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, you

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah
You the one for me, I promise, took ya home to mama, she said you the realest
All my partners say be honest, keep it real, don't let her get away, she kill it
You been around, down, down, way before they put me in the game
Look, I was ridin' pine on the sidelines and not a dollar to my name (not a dollar to my name)
They say that money make a changeup (changeup)
I done went and got my change up (yeah)
All I need is you and all I want is what I got, it's easy as a layup
And now we far away, on the white sands, later
Sippin' something with a little grin if they ain't what a winnin' team made of

[Chorus: Nija]
You lucked up on a real one, real one
Keep it one million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, yeah you
Lucked up on a real one, we just chillin'
Put you on a different feelin', one in a million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, you

[Bridge: Nija]
And when you call
I give you this work
Oh, yeah, it don't matter at all
Baby, you come first
Yeah, we be lit every night
Yeah, we be up every night
Yeah, I need you by my side
Baby, yeah, you the apple of my eye
Can't you tell I'm all about you, you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And baby, no, we won't ever stop
This love, you a rider
You know that I'm all about you, only 'bout you, you
Only 'bout you

[Outro: Nija]
I lucked up on a real one, real one
One in a million, yeah
I'm only 'bout you, yeah you
