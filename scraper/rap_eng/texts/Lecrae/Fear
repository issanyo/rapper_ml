[Intro]
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff they comfort me

[Verse 1]
I honestly grow insecure as I get older
Cause even when you hot there comes a day when you get colder
Comes a day when you slower
Time is takin' it's toll
45 on the back of the jersey upon yo' soul
I'm scared of letting go
I don't know what the future holds
My nightmares are having nightmares
I'm quite scared of what's right and fair
How I fare an eternity
Will I hear well done when He turn to me
Will I hear you care too much 'bout all of this stuff that really don't matter
You chased the wind and you won it
Got to the top of a two foot ladder
What's after I can capture all this mess my heart was after
Will I end up empty handed when I stand before my master
Did I master the mathematics of a passive disaster
Adding my selfish ambition all the while subtracting what matters
I don't know

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Late nights I can't sleep
Will I fall
When I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout
At late nights I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering
What they thinking, thinking 'bout it all

[Verse 2]
In high school we tried to act all tough
I remember a couple times I couldn't back that up
Like when I ran from them vatos
Scuffin' up my zapatos
Scared of losing my hide
I was so embarrassed inside
If I could go back in time
I would stand and say something like
I ain't never scared, never scared, never scared
I'm lyin' I'm scared of these thoughts in my head
I'm scared of possibly pushin' people right over the ledge
When I said I pledge allegiance to the struggle
Then I turn around and buckle under stress and under pressure
Bible on my dresser that could teach my pain a lesson
But I'd rather not address it
Address is in depression
I'm scared if I confess it
That you gon' look at me like I'm somethin' less
And I'm such a mess

[Break]
Celui qui a peur d'admettre ses craintes
Et c'est lui qui ne pourra pas les surmonter
On trouve la liberté dans la confession
Et la liberté dans la reconnaissance

[Verse 3]
And it just so happens I'm wrestling with my status
I'm tryna see me like He do, not focusing on this madness
They count on me count me out
On account of they fear and doubts
Keep account of my wrongs
Trying to keep me inside they house
Some just keep me around
Gotta wonder what that's about
Yea, they wanna be politically correct I suppose
But I'm comfortable in my skin while they just pretend in they clothes
I'm scared of falling and failing in front of all of my foes
And I feel some friends are unfaithful
So I keep my small circle closed
I don't want no handouts or favors
No functional saviors
I'mma tell that truth 'till it kill me
And I'm chillin' with my Creator
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus to all of my haters
For the ones that think I forgot Him
And the ones who won't let me say it
I ain't scared no mo'

[Chorus: Lecrae]
Late nights I can't sleep
Will I fall
When I peek through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing at me
And they watching, and they watching
And I'm wondering what they thinking, thinking 'bout
At late nights I can't sleep
Counting cash, counting sheep
Through the curtains all I see, fingers pointing right at me
And I'm watching, and I'm watching
And I'm wondering
What they thinking, thinking 'bout it all

[Bridge: Natalie Lauren]
Everybody always
They gon' have something to say
Whether you like it or not
Everybody always
They gone have something to say
Baby, don't take it to heart
Something to say

[Outro]
恐怖を受け入れることができないものは、
それに打ち勝つことができないだろう。
全てのものを受け入れたとき、
自由は存在し、恐怖は解き放たれる。
