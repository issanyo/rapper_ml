[Chorus: Childish Major]
Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let them know
Ayy, you can't stop me now
Ayy, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know you can't stop me now

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Last year I was feeling hopeless
I just wanted it to end
People stealing money from me, man
I swear I thought that we was friends
And I was so depressed, I was such a mess
I couldn't shake it off
Another murder on the television
Man, somebody go turn it off
I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it
Thought these people had my back boy
Then they tellin' me I asked for it
I guess I'm just another black boy
And then they killed Tamir Rice
And they just go on with they life
They tellin' me shut up talking 'bout it
Like, I should just talk about Christ
But the truth is I started to doubt God
I started to question my purpose
I started to act out
I ain't wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile
Doctors told me that my man died
I almost had a breakdown

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
So tell depression it can fly away
Tell my doubts that they can die today
I'ma catch me a wave, sail away
Can't stop me now
Tell depression it can fly away
Tell my doubts that they can die today
I'ma catch me a wave, sail away
Can't stop me now

[Chorus: Childish Major]
Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let 'em know
Ayy, you can't stop me now
Ayy, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know, ayy, you can't stop me now

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
And recently I found a peace to be
Everything that I was meant to be
This my identity, this what He give to me
This what I'm made to be
My daddy still on that crack
And he might never come back
But I still love the man, I don't judge the man
I could be on that track
I'm glad that Jesus ain't American
And that's the reason why I care again
People started praying for me
And homies tellin' me I was being arrogant
I quit poppin' them pills
And even though we get killed
I know that God got a greater plan
For the death and blood that we spill

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
So tell depression it can fly away
Tell my doubts that they can die today
I'ma catch me a wave, sail away
Can't stop me now
Tell depression it can fly away
Tell my doubts that they can die today
I'ma catch me a wave, sail away
Can't stop me now

[Chorus: Childish Major]
Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let 'em know
Ayy, you can't stop me now
Ayy, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know, ayy, you can't stop me now
