[Intro: Brvndon P]
Run it
What you want? (Huh?)
I got plenty more (Yeah I do)
All I hear is talk
What you doing now? (You ain't doing nothing)
Say you 'bout that life
All I see is ghosts (You ain't about it now)
Ay boy, you see I'm on the honor roll

[Verse 1: Brvndon P]
Realer than the realest when you messing with the dealers
And the freaky celebrators in the back, you really jealous
And momma always told me "everybody ain't your friend"
Especially the one who's singing all up in your ear
I Benz wanna Chevy up the Tahoe (Tahoe)
Apollo to each other then eVolvo
Going up like suicides on a Lambo
And when I beam, my Mini Coupe like two-door
Pop it like a picture (pop it like a picture)
Uh, On a mendal (what you want?)
And you cannot stop us
That God has rejusted
My steps have been ordered
I follow His message
I hear what He say and I read the Closed Captions
Took over my boat and said
"I am the captain and I'm right here"
Brvndon P be here, that BP
Grab a seat  and play a movie
Show you what you kid

[Chorus: JustKristofer]
All the haters are like, "really?"
Hated on me for a long, long time, long time
This is what you get
Talking about I wasn't going to make it, now I made it
This is what you get
I feel right now, ya'll here right now
This is what you get
This is what you, this is what you
This is what you get
Hated on me for a long, long time, long time
This is what you get
Talking about I wasn't going to make it, now I made it
This is what you get
I feel right now, ya'll here right now
This is what you get
(Check, check)
This is what you, this is what you

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Hey, do I walk through the valley of shadows
And doubters and haters
Of which I'm the greatest
Told myself I wouldn't make it
My faith was the fakest
Now I got to face it
He made a way
All day through the hallways
I was a just a local rapper trying to get to Broadway
Trying to get to Hollywood
Never really thought I would
But the Father had a different mission when he called me
(This is what you get)
When you not up to the spotlight, pop life
Run up on me, asking what the rock like (This is what you get)
You ain't worried about a big name, big fame
Hated on myself until the Clique came
Told me I was born to do it
Homie, what you think now?
Maybe this is confidence or maybe it's conceit now
But I know the King now
Got me in the ring now
Put me on the ropes if I'm only in the meeting now, yah

[Chorus: JustKristofer]
Hated on me for a long, long time, long time
This is what you get
Talking about I wasn't going to make it, now I made it
This is what you get
I feel right now, ya'll here right now
This is what you get
This is what you, this is what you
This is what you get

[Verse 3: Brvndon P]
(Hi hater)
Thought I wouldn't make it
But I'm here now, here now
Man I live
Because that victory is sweet
But that victory, it heat, uh
I was trying to tell them that I'm coming up
Think it was the raps, the way I'm coming up
I don't think they get where I'm coming from
What's the use of being number two
If you said I am number one?
Probably think I'm posting
I ain't tripping man, I'm sticking to the message
(Probably think I'm feeling myself)
Only thing I'm feeling is His presence
Only thing I feel is not getting in our buildings
Yeah I feel the speculation brewing in the building
Smiley face emoji
Only time they see my feelings
Black Knight, dark knight
Bringing light to the villain
(whoo)
Uh, they see me make it for them and that's heavy
(You know that that's heavy)
Don't trip man
I know you can bear it like teddy

[Chorus: JustKristofer]
Hated on me for a long, long time, long time
This is what you get
Talking about I wasn't going to make it, now I made it
This is what you get
I feel right now, ya'll here right now
This is what you get
This is what you, This is what you
This is what you get
Hated on me for a long, long time, long time
This is what you get
Talking about I wasn't going to make it, now I made it
This is what you get
I feel right now, ya'll here right now
This is what you get
This is what you, this is what you
This is what you get

[Outro]
This is what you get
This is what you get
