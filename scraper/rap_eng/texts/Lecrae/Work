[Break: Dee-1]
Aight Aight Aight
Let’s Go Dawg

[Break: Lecrae]
You know what it is

[Break: Dee-1]
Dee-1 and Lecrae

[Hook: Dee-1]
I put in 50 applications, still can’t get no work
But homie on the boulevard he said he got that work
And shawty said come over, talkin bout she got that work
Huh, man I’m thinkin bout it, but that ain’t gone work

[Bridge: Lecrae]
Hard times make the clock tick slow
Throw money at my sistas so they duck and get low
With poison in my cup, and yup I prolly sip slow
Guess that’s the way it is since I been workin 10-4

[Verse 1: Dee-1]
(I hope they hear me)
It ain’t even bout the money
Cuz I ain’t ever had nothing
But they don’t wanna see me win just simply cuz of how high I’m comin’
I’m Dee-1, that mission, vision, molten fire spittin’ soldier
Liftin’ up New Orleans
Rippin’ up your cypher from the Oval Office
Presidential flow, im talkin (YEAHHHH)
I got that good
Landslide victory cuz (YEAHHH)
I got the hood
And havin’ faith is beautiful
But faith without works is dead
Call the preacher, book the funeral
Homie spend that business
See my hook for what it is
Oh you got ends, spend that business
Feed them dirty ghetto kids
(They had a gun to Jeezy head but I heard they let em live, why?)
Cuz dude remembered that I used to teach his kid
All work, no play, that’s scary
But yo, all play, no work
That’s deadly
Before I leave I gots to ask a question:
If you got God on yo’ side, why you stressin’?
Just work

[Hook: Dee-1]

I got work

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
And if my lyrics too much
God is two times two much
And if I fail twice
Well, That is two times two much
Cuz every time I fail, you know I only fail God
And know he still accept you boy
I’m out here workin’ hard
Spiritually, I did that
Mentally, I killed that
Physically, it’s comin’ and I know where I'mma end at
Please let’s not pretend that
You know how to end that
Cycle in yo’ life that’s got you worryin where your ends at
I go where my ends at
I be dyin daily
The old me is dead, the new me’s pretty crazy
Religious folk confuse me, we on the same team
But I relate to buddy on the corner smokin’ green
So I be out there workin with em
(See I’m just tryna build)
But people wanna tear me down and tell me how to live
Man I’m workin
And listen, I ain’t got no time for haters
This game of life is hard, and I don’t love her
I’m a player, look

[Hook: Dee-1]

[Verse 3: Dee-1 & Lecrae]
I seen a rich man cry
I asked that rich man why?
He told a rich man lie
Cuz he had rich man pride
I think his rich man ride
Went on a rich man trip
But when that rich man died…
His po’ soul wasn’t missed
And though he died with a lot
That rich man still died
Ain’t no escapin’ death
You know the cost of livin’ is high
He loved to stunt in the show
Now he got nothing to show
For the life that he was given…
But a crib and a boat
A typical story
‘Crae what you think ‘bout homie?
Lonely
He gained the world but he still lost his soul, Dee
Only 1 life to live but its over
Even if you die in honor
Your possessions might still own ya, Hol’ up
I hope you know you got a purpose and a mission
Homie didn’t
So I’m giving you this wisdom so that you don’t end up with him
Censors like being blind
Paralyzed, with no taste
Can’t smell the roses
They hear what we sayin’
We ain’t playin, Bro
We workin
