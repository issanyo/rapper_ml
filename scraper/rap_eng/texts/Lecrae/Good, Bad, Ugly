[Chorus: Kasey Rashel]
Ooh
Come on everybody sit down (sit down)
People wanna act like they are in the know (in the know)
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile (off your smile)
And tell you what's the word around town (around town)
I know you don't wanna hear the truth (the truth)
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

[Verse 1]
Remember back in '02
When I was in school and actin' a fool
My soul got saved
My debt had been paid
But still I kept running off with my crew
Sex on my brain and death in my veins
Had a main thang we stayed up til 2
Smokin'
Waking and bakin' we naked
My body was lovin' it
Soul was hatin' it
Time and time after time
Our bodies grew close the girl was so fine
Heard a heart beat that wasn't hers or mine
The miracle of life had started inside
My God
Ignored the warning signs
Supressed that truth I felt inside
I was just havin' fun with this
I'm too young for this
I'm thinkin' me myself and I
Should I sacrifice this life
To keep my vanity and live nice
And she love and trust me so much
That whatever I say she'll probably oblige
But I was too selfish with my time
Scared my dreams were not gone survive
So I dropped her off at that clinic
That day a part of us died

[Hook]
Come on everybody sit down (sit down)
People wanna act like they are in the know (in the know)
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile (off your smile)
And tell you what's the word around town (around town)
I know you don't wanna hear the truth (the truth)
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof
But I just need you to believe
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly

[Verse 2]
I remember back in the day
I was barely in the first grade
Got teeth missin'
Watchin' Tom & Jerry
Tryna go outside so I can play
I was told to watch out for strangers
Keep my eyes peeled for danger
Folks workin' late I had a baby sitter
I ain't 'bout to sit here and name her
I was almost 8 when she came in late
Woke me up with a game to play
Did a few things that's hard to say
And told me to keep that secret safe
Now how a young boy supposed to deal
I'm tryna act like it ain't real
Had my innocence just stripped from me
And I still don't know how to feel
And I wonder how to address it
Can't tell my family too messy
So I just embrace it it's hard to face it
I'm too ashamed to confess it
So I kept it in and ain't speak
Didn't think it hit me so deep
So into it I got promiscuous
And only God could help me get free
But I been forgiven
My Savior risen
I'm out the prison
I know that (I know that)
I got the power to say to no to all of my struggles
God will control that (yeah)
Every time we slip and we fall
Gotta get back up and fight on
We are not defined by our past
The future look bright
I see the light on (I see the light on, I see the light on)

[Bridge]
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly
The good, the bad, the ugly yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Come on everybody sit down (sit down)
People wanna act like they are in the know (in the know)
Well I'm here to wipe off your smile (off your smile)
And tell you what's the word around town (around town)
I know you don't wanna hear the truth (the truth)
I know you hate the fact that I actually have the proof (the proof)
But I just need you to believe (to believe)
I'm talking the good, the bad, the ugly
(The good, the bad, the ugly)
(The good, the bad, the ugly)
(The good, the bad, the ugly)
(The good, the bad, the ugly)

[Outro: Kasey Rashel]
It's like, it's like people don't want to hear the truth
