[Verse 1: Kevin Ross]
Teacher, teacher, teacher
What I need to learn from your books
It's getting harder to believe you
When everything I see outside ain't adding up
How much blood, how many more tears?
How much ground is left for graves we have to dig?
How many roses can a mother accept?
Could you teach about the pain that happens everyday?

[Chorus: Kevin Ross]
But it's either they don't know
Or they don't show
The world that's too far from home
They gotta be blind to just don't care about us
And if you ever stopped to wonder why
Just look up
Just raise your head and look up to the sky
Just look up
If somebody come and try to bring you down
Just stay up in the clouds
No one can stop you now
When the world turns their back on you
Never feel you're misunderstood
Just look up, oh

[Verse 2: Kevin Ross]
Preacher, preacher, preacher
How you gon' dare to judge me? Oh no
You see the world is short of leaders
And the easy way out is just from following
How much news can we ignore?
We're feeding other countries while our neighbors starving next door
Does my color speak louder than me?
But I guess you can't change what they wanna see, so

[Chorus: Kevin Ross]
But it's either they don't know
Or they don't show
The world that's too far from home
They gotta be blind to just don't care about us
And if you ever stopped to wonder why
Just look up
Just raise your head and look up to the sky
Just look up
If somebody come and try to bring you down
Just stay up in the clouds
No one can stop you now
When the world turns their back on you
Never feel you're misunderstood
Just look up, oh

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Uh, ayy, tell me where we goin'
They got us on a short leash and all my dogs is hungry
A politician just phoned me, to prove to me he ain't phoney
He talkin' 'bout what he'll do for me if I vote for him
But I know he's slammin' that same man with the answers, prolly sellin' us cancer
My neighbourhood is tryna kill itself, sellin' poison just to buy pampers
Young dudes sellin' weight to get their weight up
They casualties of war and I ain't talkin' Al-Qaeda
Ask the government to throw us a line
It feelin' like ain't no hope left
And they threw us these lines
'Bout how they ain't got no rope left, huh
You know it's funny, when it rains, it pours
We say we got money for war but we ain't feedin' the poor
You hear me, when shots go off, sirens from cops go off
We lose a bunch of youth, the newspapers will not show off
But we were built to survive, inside this set up
And even though you fed up, uh, keep your head up

[Chorus: Kevin Ross]
But it's either they don't know
Or they don't show
The world that's too far from home
They gotta be blind to just don't care about us
And if you ever stopped to wonder why
Just look up
Just raise your head and look up to the sky
Just look up
If somebody come and try to bring you down
Just stay up in the clouds
No one can stop you now
When the world turns their back on you
Never feel you're misunderstood
Just look up, oh
