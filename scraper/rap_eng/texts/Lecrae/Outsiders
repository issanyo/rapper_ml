I won't stay here another night
If I gotta sacrifice
Who I am on the inside
I'd rather be an outsider
And you can stay if you like
I'll see you on the other side
I wanna live the free life
I'd rather be an outsider
I'd rather be an outsider
I'd rather be an outsider
I'd rather be an outsider
I'd rather be an outsider
(yeah) I'd rather be an outsider (outsider)

[Verse 1]
I really can't tell if I'm overdressed or I'm underdressed
If I'm underpaid or just overstressed
If I'm cynical or just over this
Cause I'm tired of tryna get over there, man it's over there
Party's over (party's over)
You probably couldn't tell we over here cause you hardly sober
Double shots of that ego
They laughin' at us, yeah, we know
May be at the bottom but we not forgotten, the director's plotting that sequel
'Til then we live on the outside
And it might storm and we might die
But I'd rather go with my fist high
Standing outside of your inside
I tried my best to fit in, (yeah)
Looking for a suit to fit in (yeah)
Standing outside of your prison (I tried)
Tryna find ways I can get in (no more)
Now I realize that I'm free (free)
And I realize that I'm me (I'm me)
And I found out that I'm not alone cause there's plenty people like me (say what)
That's right plenty people like me (ok)
All love me despite me
And all unashamed and all unafraid to speak out for what we might see (outside)
I said there's plenty people like me, (like me)
All outsiders like me (like me)
And all unashamed and all unafraid to live out what they supposed to be
Outsiders

[Verse 2]
I know what they askin' fo'
I know what they askin' fo'
But how you gone cover charge me my life and soul
And then turn around and ask for mo'
Time to go plus the line is long
I'mma color the outside where lines are drawn
If you wanna exclude me for being the true me, it's gucci
I already found my home, homesick
Homeless if I'm honest
Cause my home is somewhere I ain't never been before
Imma hone this here gift
Even if it doesn't
Fit in the box that'll please these folks
Some of y'all gone need these quotes
I ain't tryna eat I'm tryna feed these folks
Martin, Mandela, yeah we need these folks
We believe these folks, we could be these folks
Yeah, but they want me to take an L
Tired of taking losses so they can call me a failure
I failed at being you but I'm winning at being me
I'm winning at being free
Ain't no competition but me
See I realize that I'm free
And I realize that I'm me
And I found out that I'm not alone
And there's plenty people like me
I said there's plenty people like me (like me)
All outsiders like me (like me)
All unashamed and all unafraid
To live out what they supposed to be
Outsiders

[Outro]
It's been too dark, so many lies
Turn on the lights, open your eyes
Oh oh oh oh
We'll be runnin' through the night
It's brighter on the other side
Oh oh oh oh
Something's bigger than you and I
Brighter on the other side
Brighter on the other side
Brighter on the other side
Brighter on the other side
Brighter on the other side
