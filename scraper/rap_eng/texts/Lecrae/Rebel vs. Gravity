[Intro]
This is a duel â€” a showdown
Mr. Rebel vs. Mr. Gravity
What up Mr. Gravity? I just got some words for you

[Verse 1]
Dear Mr. Gravity, what up, I see you took off
Now you bigger than ever but to
Me it's like you took off
Clocked out, no longer a witness to the nations
Are you playing the background or really fame chasing
You sold out, used to
Be souled out
Now you just tweeting 'bout how your concert was sold out
Dudes be making songs talking bout that they all worry bout you
I'mma keep it real, my stomach turns at your current route
Wouldn't be so bad if you didn't mean so much to me
Your music changed me, now it's just disgusting me
And I assume it's the fame and the money, power and influence
You just tryna be accepted, headed to your ruin
And me? I'm just doing what you was known for doing
Bringing the truth hard
Hoping that it gets through
Somebody had to say it, might as well be me
And P.S. please don't corrupt KB

[Bridge]
Wow, that's how you feel Mr. Rebel?
I mean.. it's all love in grace but let me just talk to you

[Verse 2]
Ay look, dear Mr. Rebel
Young brother I understand
You feel like I let you
Down, like I'm misguiding all these fans
Truth is I feel arrogant and even self consumed
Explaining my motives to all
Of these people who've assumed
It's not about the money and trust me, I hate fame
Made some interesting moves while playing this chess game
And honestly did change, but never for the change
Maturity's given me liberties that I wouldn't claim
Some of the very things I used to call abomination
Are things I couldn't handle but thank the Lord for His grace
I ask you to be gracious, people ain't always shaky
Some have different convictions and others gon' make mistakes
I'm a little bit of both and I ain't mad or offended
You can forgive much when you understand you forgiven
I done a lot of living, misjudged many people
Quicker to call 'em evil before
I knew 'em as people
I'm less self righteous, not seeker sensitive
The truth is we all deserved to die the way that Jesus did
I don't wanna make every song into a sermon
Go listen to your pastor, that's where you should be learning
I love you, I'm sorry that I'm not the man you think I am
But it was never me anyway, it's the great I Am

[Outro]
Ay man, I still believe everything I wrote on Rebel, you know what I mean?
Me bragging about where I been or what kinda mission trips I'm doing
And who I'm discipling and so on and so forth in every song doesn't make me more holy
And me not talking about it doesn't make me less holy
It's all grace baby, I hope we can have graces with me as the Lord has been gracious to us all
I love you
