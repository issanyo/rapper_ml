[Hook:]
Ten-Four Charlie I think we got a problem
That boy right there gone put an APB out on 'em
You seen 'em? He gone
You seen 'em? He gone
You seen 'em? He outta there

[Verse 1: This'l]
Before you heard about Jeezy, boy,
I was already on some trap-or-die,
Was a goon, before it was cool
You can still see the pain in my eye
What you know about sitting in a jail cell, felonies, murder case,
Best friend, rolled on me, take the stand, turned state.

I am a felon, I tell no lie, hand on the Bible, head to the sky
I want to live, I ain't wanna die
when they roll upon me
let them bullets fly

It could have been the end though,
One way, hell's gates
but the Lord stepped in,
Chose to show grace,
Coulda been layed in a box dawg
6 of my homeboys carry me
but I'm alive and the old me gone,
'Cause everyday dawg I bury me

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Those who knew me be like "who he?",
they're trippin off the new me,
They like, "Man, where the old Crae, you're crazy, you can't fool me."
I would party so hard that the law tryin' to find me
I pray to God they ain't find me.
But then I hear a {whoo-whoo}
Look up in the rear view and they are right behind me
Roll down my window,
"Boy, what's your name?
'Cause you was doing 85 in the passing lane with no traffic, man"
Then I gave 'em my ID,
guess what they say,
"This boy here crazy, nah, that's just Crae"
Mayne I was psycho, wild as the hun is
I do like the Chi, doing whatever I wanted
Until I was confronted, heard about Jesus and I changed
They like, "Man what you do?
Talkin bout 'you just ain't the same'
