[Intro: Patrick Bang & SpongeBOZZ]
Aye, yo, aye, yuh, aye, yuh, aye
Aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Evan DMmix]
Just keep me in my life, and I spit nice
And you know what's up
God forbid something happens up
I love God, I got my dudes in the game
Look at my ice, they calling my name
I can't stand these fake dudes
Cause they be hating and stuff for all my money
I'ma let that stuff go, it's kinda like telling the pastor
How to commit a summon, I've got the Gospel, man
If it's the great gospel rap, so be it, man

[Chrous: GreenDog Ay333]

Make it for the hope (Huh)
Make it for the hope (Huh)
Make it for the hope (Huh)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yo, God knows what he's doing
Cause he be giving us blessings when we going, aye
She want me to sing, but I'm not PNB Rock
I gospel rap on that milly rock
But all we need is all we got, aye
My name starts from making a dime, aye
Make it rain, but not getting at this time, aye
I like these gospels and hope, aye
I know what to get hope, aye

[Chrous: GreenDog Ay333]
Make it for the hope (Huh)
Make it for the hope (Huh)

Make it for the hope (Huh)
Make it for the hope (Huh)
