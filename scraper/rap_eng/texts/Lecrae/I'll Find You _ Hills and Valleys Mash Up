[Verse 1]
Just fight a little longer my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on, and I'll find you
I'll find you, I'll find you
Just hold on, and I'll find you

[Verse 2]
I've walked among the shadows
You wiped my tears away (my tears)
And I've felt the pain of heartbreak
And I've seen the brighter days
I've prayed prayers to heaven
From my lowest place
I have held Your blessings
God, You give and take away

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what I have, Your grace is enough
No matter where I am, I'm standing in Your love

[Chorus 1]
On the mountains, I will bow my life
To the One who set me there
In the valley, I will lift my eyes
To the One who sees me there
When I'm standing on the mountain
I didn't get there on my own
When I'm walking through the valley
I know I am not alone
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
And I am not alone
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
And I am not alone

[Bridge]
Don't let the fear, make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I, I'll be there for you
No matter where you go
Don't let the fear, make you feel
Like you can't fight this on your own
You know I, I'll be there for you
No matter where you go
You'll never be alone

[Chorus 2]
On the mountains, I will bow my life
Just hold on, and I'll find you
I'll find you, I'll find you
Just hold on, and I'll find you
I'll find you, I'll find you
Just hold on, and I'll find you
You're God of the hi-hi-hills and valleys
(I'll find you, I'll find you)
Hi-hi-hills and valleys
(Just hold on, and I'll find you)

[Outro]
God of the hi-hi-hills
I am not alone
