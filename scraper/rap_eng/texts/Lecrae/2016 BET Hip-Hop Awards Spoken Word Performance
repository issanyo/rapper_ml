[Verse]
They tellin' us make “America Great Again”
I'm like hol' up, when was America great again?
Was it when they took us from our native land?
Or maybe it was when they took the natives’ land?
Let me be quiet, nah
'Cause being silent is pitiful
It's something I never do
After Philando, man, I'm wondering where was you?
They ask for your opinion
All you thinking is revenue, never do
I pray to God He make you a better you
Now, I know
Some of us we don’t know who we are
We’re too content with the gold and the cars
We got low self-esteem chasing dreams
With a goal in our heart
But society then drove us apart
Look at us from sellin' dope to our own kind
To a dope rhyme
Radio then played it more times
Paid in more dimes to some industry exec
Getting checks from a private prison
With the rap money he invest
Now, I know you’re like is this rap or is this gospel
Look, all you need to know is that I was blind
Now I’m not though
Real recognize real
If they don’t love me like 'Pac
They gon' respect how I'm moving
And then I'm never gonna stop
'Cause we was taken from Africa
Sold and treated like animals
Culturally denigrated and separated from families
But somehow we made it this far and stood firm
With nappy hairs and perms
And led for two terms
