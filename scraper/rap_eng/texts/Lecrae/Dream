(Chorus)
I only got one life to live and I'mma live it
I only got one life to live and I'mma live it

I only got one life to live and I'mma live it
Filled with the spirit of God theres no limit

So I dream
I Dream(7x)

I wanna be used by Christ in some way
Maybe it's to change a life someday

I Dream(8x)

(Verse 1)
Dream Big
One Life
One Lord
One Christ

One summer
It may not be your last one
But what you gonna do
To make it better then the last one

I used to think I was nothing in the Lord's eyes
I ain't know enough to be one of the Lord's guys
(at all)

Knew a little bible
Knew a little verses
Never made disciples
I was so observant

Other people who seemed to be doing big things
For the Lord, I guess that he gave them big dreams

A man will remind
Im feeling so behind
They say the young will see visions
But man Im feeling so blind

But then I heard of David
Taking down Goliath
Small thing to a giant
But he stilled tried it

What if I can fight it?
What if I can find it?

The heart to trust in God and dream in strength that he provided

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
So I tried
Took a step
Went left - right - left - right - left (right - left)

It's unbelievable a God worked through me
And all I had to do was to dream that he can use me

Whatcha dreaming?
Whatcha dreaming?
Whatcha dreaming about?

Dream Bigger
You don't know what God can bring about

Dream of being the player
That will lead a team to Christ
Dream of being a doctor
Who leads a team to life

Dream of Muslim nations
Turn to worship Jesus
Dream of shattered families
Stop pick up the pieces

Dream of God
Using you up in the glass holes
And share the truth of Christ
Before they see they last fall

Dream Big
Dream Large
Dream Hard
Dream God

He will do it, he can
And he said he will
Ask me how I know (how you know?)
Because I read his will

(Chorus)
