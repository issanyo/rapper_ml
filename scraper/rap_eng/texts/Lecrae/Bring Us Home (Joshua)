[Verse 1: Michael Tait]
I'm a man in the land of giants, I'm the cry of a thousands dreams
I'm the shoulders holding a nation high enough to still believe
We remember the chains we carried, won't forget about the day we left
Every hearts still beats with hope of a promise made, a promise kept

[Interlude: Blanca Callahan]
Yahweh, oh Yahweh, bring us a new day

[Hook]
Bring us home, lead us to the highest wall
Every single stone will fall, we have never walked alone
Only You can bring us home

[Verse 2: Michael Tait]
No mercy in the high noon desert, no shadow gonna block the sun
Still covered in dust from all our yesterdays and days to come
Every turn is a new temptation, you want to bow down to something new
As for me and my generation we'll serve no one but You

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Bring us home, lead us to the highest wall
Every single stone will fall, we have never walked alone
Only You can bring us home
Every teardrop in the sand longing for a distant land
We have never walked alone
Only You can bring us home

[Interlude 2: Blanca Callahan]
You are fire in the night sky; You are cloud by day
We're calling on the name of Yahweh

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
In seven days everything was made
And in a week, it's crazy how everything can change
Yeah, and we gonna march around this wall
'Til we hear the Lord's call hoping life will never be the same
So when your life is all a wilderness
And your darkest night is every one you took a breath
All you know to do is follow hoping for a new tomorrow
Where your sorrows don't exist and pain is put to death
As we stomp around a seventh time
I anticipate a taste of what He says is mine
Cry, cry, until you see it fall till you look beyond a wall
And you see it all

[Hook]
