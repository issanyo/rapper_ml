[Verse 1: Lecrae]
What really matters in life?
Is it a sprint or a marathon?
And what if finish lines make us happy?
Or are we glad we can run at all?
Can't fall, when I'm sleep, I'm chasin' a dream
When I wake up and it's over, what did I gain?
Gain, turn it up, let me hear you live
Everybody tunes in just to hear you win
I'ma race to the finish line when I'm done
I'm worth more than a gold that I never won
One, one life, one love
Can't win 'em but lose all the above

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
Don't let this feelin' fade
Lunge into the sky like a private plane
Hang on, we'll ride this wave
Watch the tide come in a little
Just a little more each day
Don't let this feelin' fade
Don't let this feelin'
Hang on, we'll ride this wave
Lunge into the sky like a private
Fly like a private plane

[Breakdown: Rivers Cuomo + Lecrae]
Don't let this feelin'
D-d-don't let this feelin' fade
Turn it up, let me hear you live
Don't let this feelin'
Don't, don't let this feelin' fade
One life, one love

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, uh
What really matters in life?
Is it a sprint or a marathon?
And what if finish lines make us happy?
Or are we glad we can run at all?
I never do it to lose, but losin' occurs
And when I do it for the love, lose never hurts
Loose, loose grip on what I can't hold
Who you foolin' with a handful of fool's gold?
Lose, lose, when you do it for the wins only
Love gave you meaning, it never was a trophy
It never was a trophy
Yeah, enjoy the race, homie

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
Don't let this feelin' fade
Lunge into the sky like a private plane
Hang on, we'll ride this wave
Watch the tide come in a little
Just a little more each day
Don't let this feelin' fade
Don't let this feelin'
Hang on, we'll ride this wave
Lunge into the sky like a private
Fly like a private plane

[Breakdown: Rivers Cuomo & Lecrae]
Don't let this feelin'
D-d-don't let this feelin' fade
Turn it up, let me hear you live
Don't let this feelin'
Don't, don't let this feelin' fade
One life, one love
