[Intro]
Aye Biz, let it drop right here

[Chorus]
You better tell me if you with me
I know the Devil tryna stop me
Got these people out here wishin' they could pop me
If they want me, come and get me!
Man, I ain't scared of none of y'all
The only thing I fear are the IRS and God
If you wanna go against me
Nah, they prolly better think twice
Got angels over my head, war on my mind
If ya' want me, come and get me!
Well, y'all might as well go ahead
I'm prolly more of a threat to y'all when I'm dead, though

[Verse 1]
Twenty-four years old, my momma brought me to the globe
Tried to tell me it was cold and taught me how to keep the coat
Now, now, now she told me to go to school and get my education
But remember there's a bias to them books that they be makin'
Gave me, Soul on Ice and taught me
'Bout the Middle Passage, told me
God ain't white and that there's
More to life than rap and I
Expressed my opinions, my faith, and my views
If they wanna keep me quiet, tell 'em, "Do it!"

[Chorus]
You better tell me if you with me
I know the Devil tryna stop me
Got these people out here wishin' they could pop me
If they want me, come and get me!
Man, I ain't scared of none of y'all
The only thing I fear are the IRS and God
If you wanna go against me
Nah, they prolly better think twice
Got angels over my head, war on my mind
If they want me, come and get me!
Well, y'all might as well go ahead
I'm prolly more of a threat to y'all when I'm dead, though

[Verse 2]
Huh, once upon a time, God opened up my mind
And He showed me I don't have to be a product people buy
With this God-given wisdom, I can climb out the holes
Stay up out the system 'cause the system never let you go
Speak the Truth without no fear
It's gon' ruin in my career
I've been a mascot for too long
I ain't come here for no cheers
First of all, let me be clear one time
Let me be real one time
If you want a religious puppet you gon' have to hang this guy
I've been around the world and seen pretty girls get caged up like sex slaves
Crooked cops done pulled me over, treated me like I ain't made
In the image of God and that's so odd
I'm at Sunday service with a snapback
And if ya' hatin' on me go and hate
But if you gon' ride

[Chorus]
You better tell me if you with me
I know the Devil tryna stop me
Got these people out here wishin' they could pop me
If they want me, come and get me!
Man, I ain't scared of none of y'all
The only thing I fear are the IRS and God
If you wanna go against me
Nah, they prolly better think twice
Got angels over my head, war on my mind
If they want me, come and get me!
Well, y'all might as well go ahead
I'm prolly more of a threat to y'all while I'm dead, though

[Verse 3]
Ahem, well, um, the sky ain't the limit
To me it's a limitation in a planetary on my navigation
You can follow me to every destination, come on
Let me make it plain, look, I'm just tryna fly withcha
Let me tell it, man look, I ain't never lied to you
I'ma keep it real, I'ma ride withcha, get the Key & Peele
If you gettin' money like you kin to Will, go and fill up banks, go and make a mill'
If you hatin' on me, then you speak in tongues, get a translator (oh yeah)
If you flakin' on me go and let it snow, I got plans later
Look, I've been tryna tell 'em since '04-'05 (that's Real Talk)
Still, you know these people doubt me every time
Had an alter ego, but my ego altered at the altar call
Looked up at the ceiling and I heard the angels talkin', y'all
What'd they say? They said
I was made in His image, in His likeness
Bite this if you don't like this, herbs and spices is righteous
Nothin' in the world quite like this, hold on to it with a tight fist
Prototype this, no matter what yo' type is

[Chorus]
You better tell me if you with me
I know the Devil tryna stop me
Got these people out here wishin' they could pop me
If they want me, come and get me!
Man, I ain't scared of none of y'all
The only thing I fear are the IRS and God
If you wanna go against me
Nah, they prolly better think twice
Got angels over my head, war on my mind
If they want me, come and get me!
Well, y'all might as well go ahead
I'm prolly more of a threat to y'all while I'm dead, though, ha
