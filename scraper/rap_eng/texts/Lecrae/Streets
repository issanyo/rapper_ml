[Chorus]
Hey we bring this to the street
Cause they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street
Cause it's mean up in the street
We're redemmed of the street
That used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched
By the scene of the streets

[Verse One]
Hey, this ain't aimed at the church but you might be incouraged
This is for the folks hurt on the block with the word
See ya playing in the dirt, hoping you can get the bird
Steady sippin on your syrup, wit a dutch full of burb
Let me tell ya what's gon happen dawg, this is why I'm rappin dawg
You catch time for the crime and then ya trappin dawg
Oh what's worse, is it could be your hers
6 feet up in the dirt, got yo baby brother hurt
Yea, a worse still when you die, gets real
You eternally separated from God for a trillian
Million, billion eternaty mayne
Ain't no number for it, this should be concerning ya mayne
Look, ya can't sleep cause ya sin so heavy
Ya sweating in ya sheets cause ya sin so heavy
Ready to die, naw, dawg, you ain't ready
You don't truely know what's on the other side young revin
Is sin equals death, so turn from your mess, believe and confess
Christ is God in the flesh, he died for your debt, he did resurrect
A tool and a vest won't really save you from death

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
They never saw us coming, they had they heads turned
We faced the persecution, we know the led burns
We know them nails hurt, we know them thorns scared
We know our futures bright, but it ain't in the stars
We a new generation, who know the worlds hurts
And though we don't rock suits, we still part of the church
Our souls hurt too, our burdens hurt too
We want the Lord to be gloryfied on the earth too
We wearing dickies, yeah, but we still know the bible
We yelling like David was, ready to start revival
I know some kids in Dallas still in Jr. High
They ain't tryin to pimp girls, push work, or get high
Yea they jeans hangin low, and they keep they hat cop
But they living by the word instead of living by the block
Gettin trained a disciple, they changed all they idols
From juves in the streets to the God of the bible

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
We done redemmed of the streets that used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched by the scene of the streets
So we bring this to the street, they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street, cause it's mean up in the street
Chasin cream up in the street, servin feinds up in the street
And the scream that they see makes them feind what they see
To be the man of the street, that's why we stand in the street
To tell the whole world about the stand of the peace
The god man of the street, slian lamb for the street
That came and died for all the sinfull people in the street
Through him the cycle of the street when man rival in the street
Could be revival in the street, take the bible to the street
Cause his bride should be the street, stop trying to be discret
Why you lunging men and women steady dying in the street
So we pray up in the street, man we stay up in the street
Cause we find our God heart, man it pains for the street
