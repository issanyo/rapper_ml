[Intro]
Gimme a second, uh
Gimme a second, yeah
Gimme a second
Listen what I'm sayin' to you, uh huh, listen
Gimme a second
All I need is a second, yeah
Gimme a second, uh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Aye, listen, Cole talk that college talk, Wayne talks gangs
Jay be talkin' money, man, and 'Ye talk fame
And people say I talk about the same ol' thing
Reason that I sound the same 'cause the Truth don't change
Look, people get it twisted like a lemon in a spirit
If I ain't talkin' killin', I must be talkin' 'bout healin'
And I ain't talking 'bout how Jesus gon' make me a million
With my hands to the ceilin', I got that spiritual feelin'
Head bowed down, knees to the floor
You a Christian and you rap? That must be the way you flow—no
I talk reality like momma on her death bed
The birth of a child, a soldier losin' his left leg
Who gon' write songs to give him hope in his chair?
Addicted to pain killers, wife left last year
Your favorite rapper was prolly tryna make his next hit
Talkin' look at what I got, who I shot, and who I tipped
Couldn't be more common if them boys made sense
Couldn't be more common if Serena was they chick
And this is not a diss, this how reality sound
Let it off my mind, this how my mentality sound
Yeah!

[Hook]
Everything I do, I do it for you
I don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing
Ain't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play
You ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name
But in my short time on this Earth
I done died, been rebirthed and I know this sounds strange to you
So give me a lil' time, let me spit a couple lines and I promise—
It might just change you too, change you too

[Verse 2]
I sound like the mad rapper 'cause I'm crazy
The radio be like, "We love you," but they never play me
And I be doin' shows like, "You ain't even gotta pay me"
I just wanna spread the same message that done saved me
You see, I prolly grew up just like you
Tellin' my heroes, "Man, I wanna be just like you"
I got in trouble, went to court
Judge showed me couple inmates and he told me, "Man, they started off just like you"
I never rolled around strapped, I was busy chasin' girls and money
I played ball and smoked weed, thought the world was funny
I went to church a few times, with my head on a swivel
And I was lookin' for the bad ones that sat in the middle
I couldn't remember a sermon, I never caught the Spirit
And if Christians was tryna rap, man, I'm not tryna hear it
I never would've imagined that I'd be rhymin'
About the same God that I couldn't confide in
Never planned to get married, raise a family, help kids grow up
Visit people in prison, I was busy tryna blow up
But see, now I'm unimpressed with the way these folks dress
Or the engine in they trunk, all I want is soul rest
And I'm so blessed, look at what He did to me
How could I keep this to myself? Somebody bled for me
Nah, you just gon' have to hate this
'Cause God's the only reason that I'm able to say this
So play this

[Hook]
Everything I do, I do it for you
I don't want a single thing, I don't want a single thing
Ain't got no kind of angle, I ain't tryna play
You ain't gotta know my name, you ain't gotta know my name
But in my short time on this Earth
I done died, been rebirthed and I know this sounds strange to you
So give me a lil' time, let me spit a couple lines and I promise—
It might just change you too, change you too
