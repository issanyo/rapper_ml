[Intro: Scotty ATL]
You can run bruh
Just know as you run
You're runnin from your dreams
Your hope, and everything you wanna be
You gotta learn that you gotta believe in yourself man
And more important, you gotta be yourself

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Yeah
I got into it with my partner today
We don't see eye to eye
Im trying to tell him some real stuff
Guy to guy
The dope boy struggling livin' pie to pie
The team straight my dog, why try to and a eye?
We stay focused, God blind us like a race horse
Tryin to keep us steady like its not a race course
A lotta cats wishing they could hold my feet down
But I'm bout to dive in success fool faith first
As I get close [?]
Some hater keeping it cool some cats [?]
But everybody down and tell that its a lie
When the shit hit the fan all I see is me and God
Do me a favor, don't do me a favor
Especially if its ammo you're gonna use later
This is [?] East side hustle [?]
When I get home lets not fuss or fight
Nah

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
All day these folk been out of line
Look I ain't tryin trace em
Or couldn't paste em
Go get my chalk and eraser
And its slave blood running through my veins
Knows how to remain calm right under the arm of terrible pain
Man I blame our hearts for this problem, and I call the spade of spade
But the king is comin back so these jokers betta get saved
I ain't tryin to fight the bloggers
The fans and the critics
Im at war with myself
So I'm occupied at the minute
And I know you got to get it
You tired of fighting the law
Tired of stressing cause you ran up in that thing raw
And the toughest man alive is still allergic to lead
I let the Lord fight my problems instead
Its real talk, some of us die for dollar bills like thats all we worth
End up lyin' in the dirt
Picture on some shirt
Got our mommas cryin cause we trying to rep that turf
So keep your peace cause there's no peace on Earth
Thats what they tell me
