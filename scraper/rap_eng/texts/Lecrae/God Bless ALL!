[Intro]
Aye, let's go

[Verse]
Yo, dawg, I'ma have to get chicken, you want some?
While I'm in the praise of the Lord, dang, I'm gone
I was in that studio, tryna keep it getting fire
Aye, you better keep this jam up
Because I'm real tired, aye yuh
And I pray to the Lord in the church, yeah I made that work
I was silent in the court
You gotta keep those cheetos coming, but you can eat Go Gurt
Now that dude hating cause he don't know about yogurt
