[Intro]
Kadosh—Old Testament
Hagios—New Testament
Inherently, the Word means to holy, we know in not holy in our own terms, but Christ Who loved makes us holy. So because we satisfied the wrath of God, the beef has been crushed, now we got a new identity, called a saint

[Verse 1]
Yup!
Hey, hey
Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
And in that heavy metal Devil that would send me straight to Hell wit' it
Thought it was no helping it
Selfishness was celibate
I'd sell a bit, but I'd make sure I don't sit up in that cell a bit
Yell a bit only when hurt came for certain
Illiterate, ain't know that the Word came
Then that Word hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price for me
That's how I gained the right to be the son of God I'd like to be
Changed my heart, gave me a desire for His work, man
Kill me if you want, but I'm gon' get back out that dirt, man
Not yet what I'm gonna be, but not what I used to be
I bless His name forever Who would chose me and start using me
Used to love my sinning full of greed, full of hate
I might say that I loved Jesus but that talk was really fake
I'd be lusting for ya cousin if it wasn't for His Grace
Yeah, he took me outta nothing and He made ya boy a saint

[Hook]
Yeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)

[Verse 2]
You got to understand Jesus agreed back in eternity
To sign a bloody covenant and take a deadly turn for me
He ain't just agreed, fulfilled it to the death of Him
Took that bloody cup that's meant for us straight to the neck and yeah
Swallowed all that bitterness, pain, and affliction
Ain't a soul in Hell with pain comparable to this one
Brought me to repentance, homie, I'm blood purchased
Daily I'm conformed to His holiness so I worship
Jesus finished the work, He resurrected on high
That means that He beat death, and best believe so will I
See some believe they can fly, but I believe I can die
Resurrect, leave the Earth, and live forever with God
He will march through the sky while the stars sing His praises
Planets dance around while the universe is amazed and
Me I get to gaze upon His beauty for days, man
If I could be anything, baby, I'd be a saint

[Hook]
Yeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)

[Spoken]
1 Corinthians Chapter 1, Paul calls one of the worst churches in the New Testament saints. Not because of man's choosing, but clearly becuase of God's choosing through the Lord, Jesus Christ

[Verse 3]
Now, now you might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
But first I hated church, I'd only pray to get my wish list
I'd be just like you, "doin'-my-dance-up-in-the- club" folk
I promise I ain't choose it, I was chosen to loved on
Eyes low, blowin' dro, that's the life I used to know
But Jesus chopped me up and slowed me down just like that Houston flow
A dead man 'til somebody hit me with the hardest facts
The Gospel hit my heart, I guess that's what you call a heart attack
I'm looking at Ephesians 2 like, "What did Jesus see in you?"
It's nothin' by His grace He chose to love on folk like me and you
And I don't understand it, homie, I never planned it
I was chasing money and fast women and, man, then
I met the great I am, Son of Man or the Lamb
Snatched ya boy up outta Hell and got me workin' for His plans
Used think I was the man 'til I met Him
All that arrogance and pride, I dead 'em and fo'get 'em, I'm a saint

[Hook]
Yeah, they tell me sugarcoat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well deny the Christ, be ashamed, but I ain't
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
'Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only we hope we got, that's why I'll die for my faith
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
I'm a saint (I'm a saint)
