Working
Won't Back Down
Working
Won't Back Down
Lot of misconceptions[?]

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
You hear me talking about my peace talk
They ain't use to it all they know is peace talk
9 million of pieces with the grind stone[?]
Welcome to my time zone
None of that ain't rhyme yo
I'm on that life check, that real talk, that God work
That check the city
That rebuild  it's all that work
They looking for some hope
And for some religion
And I ain't sell them work
But I give them the business

[Hook]
Working
Won't Back Down
Working
Won't Back Down
Lot of misconceptions[?]

[Verse 2: Jamar Dawson]
No matter your profession
We in that same struggle
Don't worry bout your confession[?]
We in that same huddle
Follow my lead brah
Peace out on my old brah
Checks in that rehab
Thank God that I detex [?]
We go hard to the max
I been through that hard times
Now we full of color
Showing love to one another
I can't stop now
I press on no turning back

[Outro: Jamar Dawson]
Going to fight
And to win
I won't back down
So much things
Everything
