[Chorus: K-So]
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's (Zaytoven)
For the blue strips, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
Selling prescription pills, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Ay, By the pounds, yuh, cut it up, bust it down
Then go hit the mound, yeah
Pitch it, get it out the ground, yeah
Get it up out of the mud
Don't come to me for the dub
I got them quarters and halves
Sell the whole thing if I have to
Blue strip, blue strip, blue strip, watch me whip this new whip
Ain't my life too foolish (foolish)
Grandma said don't do this (don't do it)
But I got a new chick (yeah), and lil' mama too thick (yeah)
And she like them red bottoms
Addicted to blue strips
I know I'm livin' too fast (fast), I know I'm blown' this cash (cash)
I try to find me a way out, they try to put me in shackles
On a roll with the transport, lot of powder in the passport
Ain't anticipate the task force, this ain't really what I asked for (yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, the money got me trapped, in the mix
Plus my babies hungry and I'm tryin' to pay my mama rent
They say go to college, high school ain't prepare me to get it
I'ma felon, too, can't get no job fresh up out the pen

[Chorus: K-so]
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's
For the blue strips, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
Selling prescription pills, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Bands will make her dance, pop a perc and pop a Xan
In the club with her girlfriends tryna cop a bag
Go hard for the Goyard
Got that new Mercedes parked in front of your yard
Twerking for that check, mean no disrespect
But shawty getting older, she don't know what's next
She might be Cardi B, she thinking Amber Rose
She's stacking up her money, she hope it never folds
Maybe she'll let it go, she know she meant for greater
But she was broke a month ago but now she getting paper
I don't condone it but I don't condemn, I know she a gem
'Fore we hate we outta volunteer to help her change careers

[Chorus: K-so]
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's
For the blue strips, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
Selling prescription pills, doing the most, for them blue strips, doing the most
I do anything for the money, let the money drive me crazy
I'ma trap, hit a lick, just to pull up in the latest
In the streets, in the club, man I guess that's how they made me
Every night, getting lit, I like to party like the 80's
