[Verse: Lecrae]
Uh what's happenin', oh what's happenin'
Listen, leggo
You hear me talkin’, I’m on that peace talk
They ain’t used to it, all they know is piece talk
Nine milli or the piece with the rhinestone (bling)
Welcome to my time zone, none of that in my rhymes, yo
I’m on that life change, that real talk, that God work
That shake the city, that rebuild
Let it be healed, that’s hard work
I don’t hustle hope (hope), don’t peddle religion (nope)
And I ain’t sellin’ work, but I give them the business

(Nobody Move) (x6)
(Nobody) (x8)
