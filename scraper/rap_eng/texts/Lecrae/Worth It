[Chorus: Jawan Harris]
It's just a little dirt, it's just a little stain
Trust me, you're still worth it
Just goin' through the pain
It's just a little tear, don't you worry, God is here
Don't be so hard on yourself, don't be so hard on your—
It's just a little dirt, it's just a little stain
Trust me, you're still worth it
Just goin' through the pain
It's just a little tear, don't you worry, God is here
Don't be so hard on yourself, don't be so hard on yourself

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Listen, now you gon' have to explain to me how the Lord love a little sinner like me
I've been over-stressin', I've been second guessin'
I was on them Xan's for a second, I was feelin' so defeated
I thought I was a leader
Hurt so many people, all I see is teardrops when I try to go to sleep
I heard you had a soft spot for the black sheep
Offer me forgiveness while I struggle to receive it
Now would you still love me if I took her home last night?
Smokin' and sippin' on that Patrón last night?
If I was poppin' pills tryna cop a thrill?
And I know I'm wrong but I do it 'cause it feels so right
Would I, would I still be a child?
And would you still be around?
If I'm sick of church and tired of prayin'?
It's been a while, I'm hopin' that you're patient

[Chorus 2: Kierra Sheard]
It's just a little dirt, it's just a little stain
Trust me, you're still worth it
Just goin' through the pain
It's just a little tear, don't you worry, God is here
Don't be so hard on yourself, don't be so hard on your—
It's just a little dirt, it's just a little stain
Trust me, you're still worth it
Just goin' through the pain
It's just a little tear, don't you worry, God is here
Don't be so hard on yourself, don't be so hard on yourself

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Uh, she prolly too hard on herself (self)
She put the blame all on herself (self)
She run into the arms of another man ('nother man)
And she done gave her heart to another man ('nother man)
She know she ain't the woman that she wanna be
Can't look in the mirror 'cause she don't see what she wanna see
She gave her love away too many times
Heard too many lies, she don't got no tears left to cry, yeah
Somewhere, she got a little child, but
She ain't see him in a while, now
She gave her baby to the system
Dealin' with her demons, she was fightin' her addiction
And this is all fact, not fiction
Prayin' that the Lord could really fix it
Said the last time was the last time
But the last time got her feelin' like the Devil's mistress, but listen

[Bridge: Kierra Sheard & Jawan Harris]
It's not easy, when you gotta face yourself
Truth is, I don't deserve not one bit of help
Promise that your lovin' never leave
Once you've seen all of me
It's just so hard to believe it all but for grace
To trust you more (trust you more)
To love you more (to love you more)
To know I'm yours
Oh, but for grace
Trust you more (trust you more)
To know I'm yours
Oh, but
Oh, but for grace
To trust you more (trust you more)
To love you more (love you more)
To know I'm yours
Trust you more (trust you more)
To know I'm yours
Oh, but for grace
Trust you more (trust you more)
To love you more

[Outro 1: Tony Evans]
You say, "But I was abused"
He got greater grace
You say, "But I was misused"
But He gives greater grace
"But you don't understand, I've been addicted for years"
Yeah, but think of all the years of your addiction, add 'em together
And the verse still says, 'He gives greater grace' (grace)

[Outro 2: Kierra Sheard]
Oh, yeah
Oh, I'm yours
Yeah
Oh, but for grace
Grace
