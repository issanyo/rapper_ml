[Pre-Hook: Breyan Isaac]
They say wash in the river of Jordan
Wipe away your sins like I’ve done mine
And the people then they’ll be equals
There’s too many sinkholes we’ve left behind

[Hook 1: Breyan Isaac]
I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah
I gave up my all
When I felt lost not a one of ya’ll called
When I took off everybody else stalled
I don’t really understand what ya’ll on
What ya’ll want
I can’t live, can’t be free
I can’t be here
Gave my sweat gave my tears
Gave up all the best of my years
I done gave everything
I ain’t gained anything
Just pain and more sadness
Just broad strokes and blank stares
No details and no canvas
Nah I ain’t livin for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

[Hook 2: Breyan Isaac]
I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
So Imma leave religion for a relationship
Never sell my soul Imma sell my ship
I failed you all because I failed to help
Just know I failed myself
But faith keeps me from folding
It’s all I got left I’m left here with no one
I ain’t choose You but You say I’m chosen
And when I feel lost the cross all I hope in
I lost my religion but I found God
Sounds odd but I’m better at seeing how far
Did I come from the dark is the nights to the light
Irregardless of all of my many flaws
Amen
I ain’t livin for your love
Case dismissed I don’t need another judge
I done got everything off my chest
But I got one more thing to confess

[Pre-Hook: Breyan Isaac]
They say wash in the river of Jordan
Wipe away your sins like I’ve done mine
And the people then they’ll be equals
There’s too many sinkholes we’ve left behind

[Hook 2: Breyan Isaac]
I’m losing my religion
I’ve realized I wasn’t built for these conditions
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah

[Outro: Breyan Isaac]
They say wash
In the river of Jordan
I’m losing my religion
