[Chorus: Abe Parker]
We three kings with the diamond rings, bringing gifts, coming from afar
Over the hills and mossy mountains, following yonder star
Born a King in Bethlehem, have you seen the One they call Messiah? Oh
We're looking for a king
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
We’re looking for the Prince of Peace
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
We're looking for a king
I think I found a King
I think I found a King, yeah
Over everything
Put Him over everything, yeah

[Verse 1: Paul Russell]
Six miles to a real messiah
Instead he waiting for a king since Jeremiah
Or really since me molded China and the Carolinas
Just to leave a brother speechless like laryngitis
They barely write it in the book what it looks like
Hooked on chasin' bright lights on a foot hike (Where we goin’?)
Just to find something or better someone
Some young kid to do what we had undone
And that's no walk in the park
'Cause they ain't hear the cherubim droppin' the harks
You wonder if this star won't stop in the dark
You wonder if you did the whole walk on a farce
And I could feel that too
Tryna see it as He's leading me through
Keep your eyes on the Star and you'll be dreamin’ it too
And keep the frankincense handy, you’ll be needin' it soon
He’s got redeemin' to do, yeah

[Chorus: Abe Parker]
We three kings with the diamond rings, bringing gifts, coming from afar
Over the hills and mossy mountains, following yonder star
Born a King in Bethlehem, have you seen the One they call Messiah? Oh
We're looking for a king
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
We're looking for the Prince of Peace
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
We’re looking for a king
I think I found a King
I think I found a King, yeah
Over everything
Put Him over everything

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Three kings, wise, rode all night
Ooh, what a blessing it is to be in Your sight
Starin' at the sun, Your glory shines so bright
I could see the stars shinin' on you all night
One day, uh, we've been waitin' for this one day, yeah
And we've been hopin' for a long time, yeah
That we knew You were comin' some day
Oh, come on, so come on, come on
Praise the Savior, hear the angels
Singin' songs from the Heavens that we know You came from
Was the lowest of the low, born in a manger
Came to Earth out of love so You could save us
Three kings

[Chorus: Abe Parker]
We three kings with the diamond rings, bringing gifts, coming from afar
Over the hills and mossy mountains, following yonder star
Born a King in Bethlehem, have you seen the One they call Messiah? Oh
We're looking for a king
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
We're looking for the Prince of Peace
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
We're looking for a king
