[Verse 1]
Yeah Yeah
A lot of people don't know what they believe in (what?)
I don't even know what they believe in
They probably full of doubts going bouts what they
Fear cheers hears to the ears you can count
Or the ones that you can't though
Unashamed of the faith that i bank on
Yeah i said it
Paid my debt on the cross good credit
Only one God: Father, Son, and the Sprit
Father made plans and His Son came and did that
Born of a virgin and died on a Pilate
Pilot: He don't need one but he still fly
Rose and did a reverse skydive
No lie, no lie, boy He coming back
I hope you on the scene before the sky crack
Im headed to party where the lights at
Holla at me I can I can be your sky captain

[Bridge]

So let go and we'll have the time of our lives
Don't worry that part of your life
Have a good time
Everybody dance

[Hook]
Get up, get up, let me get get get get
Get up, get up let me put you on
Get up, get up, let me get get get get
Get up, get up let me put you on
Get up, get up, let me get get get get
Get up, get up let me put you on
