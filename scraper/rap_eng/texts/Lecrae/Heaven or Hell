[Verse 1]
They tell me 'Crae, murk the track
Hurt the rap
Nah dawg, let me pose a question to ya
Have ya heard of my Dad?
He purchased us back, puttin' man's curse on his back
I worship for that, its my whole purpose in fact
Purple and black, is how He looked
I'm certain of that
And man I cry when I hear of how the curtain was cracked
But he rose in 3 days
That's a pertinent fact
And since He created and saved me
I serve Him for that
I read His Word all the time so He stay on my mind
Flesh rise all the time so I stay on the grind
When its time to go to Heaven I don't pray I'm in line
I'm 100 percent positive, I'm waitin' for mine
Ain't no if's and's or but's, who's or what's
You walkin' away from Christ man, you losin' touch
Take away your ? man you're doin' too much
The world's feet rushin' to evil, pursuin' their lusts
C'mon!

[Hook 2x]
I hope you're all listening well
There's only 2 places to dwell
(Heaven or Hell)
And if you're representin' the first
I pray you're representin' it well
(Heaven or Hell)

[Verse 2]
Some of y'all got it twisted
Hell, why risk it
Lives can be fixed through Christ, I'm a witness
And I don't care about 5 mikes or a hit list
I'm gettin' kinda used to gettin' dissed as a Christian, dawg
Let's get one thing straight
Out the gate, I'm the type of dude that'll put a slab of truth on your plate
I don't care if ya heard it twice
I ain't trippin' if ya just left church- ya heard of Christ?
Let me tell ya what was told to me
6 hours on a cross while His holy blood flowed for me
What ya know about a sacrifice
Would ya step off a throne for the same one that snatched your life?
Let me tell ya dawg, Christ is real
Without Him ya got nothin'
Your livin' off of life's appeal
Make Him Lord and your life is sealed
Cuz your all on Death Row talkin' bout ya kinda like the deal
C'mon!

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo, I might I to bleed for this
I'm not ashamed of Christ, there's Romans 1:16 for this
And I don't care if I'm blinded dawg
Every time I trip and fall I just be reminded dawg
And ya call yourself grindin' dawg?
You can serve more birds than churches but your still dyin', dawg
I don't care what city you from-
Whether from the suburbs or slums Christ still gonna come
Matter of fact if He come now
You can be a 6'8" heavy-weight but your knees gon' bow
Ain't no tellin' Him to ease on down
And the trumpet sound and BLAT!
Everybody see that ground
I don't care about fame or wealth
Put my God on a shelf?
Nah dawg, I'd rather hang myself
Forgive me if I can't contain myself
Cause if you died and didn't hear the Gospel
I'd blame myself
C'mon!
