[Interlude: Lecrae]

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
What's Up, Hey There
Let Me Make This Thing Clear
God Loves You Right Where You're At
But Too Much To Let You Stay There
So Keep Going And Keep Growing
Until The Day That We Gone
And We Go Harder Than We Ever Been
Cos We Already Got That Freedom
I Was So Low
Now I'm So High
I Don't Need Drugs
I Tell Em No Lie
I Got Something Much Better
I Got Something Much Better
This Buzz Don't Last
For The Moment That Pass
My God He Be Giving Me Pleasure For Ever So Rise

[Interlude: Lecrae]

[Verse 2 : Andy Mineo]
I'm Feeling Extra Fresh
In My Soul Not The One That I Chose To Dress
Cos The King Of All Kings Put Death To Death
Now I Get To Live Life and The Best Is Yet To Come
And I Ain't Even There But I'm
Walking By Faith In This Race Imma Run I'm
Taking Off Old The New What I Put On
It's About To Go Down
Gimme The One That Frees Us
I'm Talking About This Jesus
You Need Him and will never ever
Be the same I remember seeing him with the optics
[?]
Unfamiliar With The Unfamiliar Logic
But The Topic Of Gospel Is A Possible Love
Is Given To These [?]
And We Pressing Into Him
Even If It Means Losing
Everything To Pursue Him
To Know Him It's Time To Rise
