[Spoken 1: Lecrae & Girlfriend]
Hello?

Hey, what's up, girl?

Hey, how you doin'?

Uh, I'm alright. What you up to?

Just hanging out with my homegirl

For real? Well, what you gon' be doin' later on, though?

Later on, like, what time?

Um, at 'bout 1:30 or so

Oh, I don't know, that's a little late...

A little late? I mean, I don't really get a lot of time with you as it is, so I'm sayin', I mean, I at least wanna hook up with you tonight

I don't know 'bout that, that's just a little late

Well, look. You—I don't know. You think about it and I'ma call you back

Alright

Alright, bye

[Spoken 2: Girfriend & Her Friend]
Girl, who was that?

That's that guy I was tellin' you about

Oh, so what's he talkin' 'bout?

He was talkin' 'bout comin' over later on, like
'bout 1:00, 1:30, or so

Isn't it kinda late?

Yeah, it is

I know you like him and all, but... He shouldn't be comin' over here that late, and I know you tired of bein' single, but I—I think you should wait...
