[Intro]
Killa... killa
Killa, killa
Killa
Killa, killa
Killa

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Uhh! I know it's gon' kill me but I just can't let it go
And the, taste so appealing's got a grip upon my soul
These, honey dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again
Sippin on seduction while we eatin on some secret sin
(No one will never know) says the whisper in my ear
And I know I should be over this but I ain't seein clear
And I ain't leavin here, unless somebody save me
Walkin to my grave, lettin evilness enslave me
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fuelin my fascination
While I'm intoxicated she starts her assassination
I'm losin all my honor and my years to the merciless
Givin all my life away but I'm just so immersed in this (killa)

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Baby this is innocent (killa)
It won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
I'm only here for your benefit (killa)
I'm your every wish (killa)
Come on and let me in (killa)
Baby this is innocent (killa)
And it won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
Close your eyes and let's get lost tonight (killa)
It'll be alright (killa)
You'll see I'm not a (killa)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Her feet go down to DEATH, so don't let her consume you
Even though her heart is black, her exterior's beautiful
She'll take yo' life away, and strip away yo' joy
Pretends that she gon build you up but she just gon' destroy you
My friends fell low, when they was so high
Got me runnin scared of myself, no lie
And I know I'm gon' die, I tried cold turkey
But when I'm feelin worthy, Satan's sure tryin to merk me
I'm doin myself dirty, flirtin with what's perverted
I should follow the word but I guess I'd rather be murdered
{*ahem*} Excuse me I mean martyred, cause I'm killin myself
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon' name her Death
Breath {*gasps*} taker, she take my breath away
Replaces it with poison, and I'm so swept away
I need some prayer today, hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody make me break up, I'm datin a (killa)
