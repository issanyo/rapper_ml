[Intro: Lecrae]
Yeah yeah
Beatbreaker beatbreaker you a fool for this man
You know where this beat came from?
From the bottom
What you know 'bout it

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I came up from nuthin'
Me, my mama, my auntie, my uncle, my cousins
No stranger to hustlin'
Now the money is legal
But law do not trust me
And I done been through it
I done been in it, boy
I done been through it
Came from the mud, young blood
Flip a dollar to a dub
No regrets, just a bunch of tattoos
Dagoâ€™s goes for the fifty
Pray I'm an example when they get me
Devil at my window tryna tempt me
I've never been a picture of perfection
Bring a bottle to my section
Cause we celebrating now that we up in it
I came from the bottom of the slave ship
Bottom of the master's boot is what the slave get
So when I rise, Imma look 'em in the eyes, say "Surprise!"
You can hate me
But my mama know we made it
From the bottom

[Hook]
Put me in a lose-lose, man
Imma win either way
Started from the bottom now we got 'em
Tell 'em that we're here to stay
And even if they take it all
Imma win either way
We gon' be straight
I came up from the bottom
I came up from the bottom
I came up from the bottom

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Yeah, yeah
I came up from nothing
I came up from where choppers sound like the drumroll
It's pop-pop-pop-pop if you stuntin'
I came up from where they might rob you
Cause Wholefoods and Publix is not in the budget
The fathers is gone, the mothers are working
They high of that stress cause they hurtin'
Lord we need You now, don't desert us
You identify with me bruh?
I would say get your hands up
But I'm scared that cops may think
That you may have a gun (don't shoot!)
So when you see me on the TV
Or throwing shows up in your city
Just know I put on for those in the gutter, they need me
You know that you not forgotten
You know that God really got us
Never forgot that I came from the bottom

[Hook]
Put me in a lose-lose, man
Imma win either way
Started from the bottom now we got 'em
Tell 'em that we're here to stay (started from the bottom)
And even if they take it all (You can take it all)
Imma win either way
We gon' be straight
I came up from the bottom (from the bottom, came from the bottom)
I came up from the bottom (I came up)
I came up from the bottom
I came up from the bottom
