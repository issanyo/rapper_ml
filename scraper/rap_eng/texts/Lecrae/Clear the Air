[Hook:]
I hear them talking but maybe, you got it twisted though
I hear them talking but maybe, you got it twisted though
I hear them talking but maybe, you got it twisted though baby
You got it twisted though baby, you got it twisted

So...

I'm a take it there, let me clear the air
I'm a take it there, let me clear the air
I'm a take it there, let me clear the air
Let me clear the air, let me clear the air

[Verse 1: PRo]
They say I done changed "what's his problem man? He don't sound the same
Gimme bars about the game or how every rapper is lame
I'm like "that's so 2006" hate what you 'bout to get
Sorry you mad, but you can take me off your Christmas list, bruh
Ain't no way that I'm a sell my blow for the every good flow just to get you off
I dedicate every letter word syllable to the one that is on the Cross
Homie please, every line I craft it for the lost
I ain't gotta move another CD, you ain't gotta like me, I'm good boss
I ain't returnin' back, go'n ahead and hate
I let you tell me what I am, now let me tell you what I ain't
I ain't no lame, I don't chase fame, I ain't no copy of Lecrae
What I say is for the King, you can take that to the bank
You were perfect then it came bound, died and was slain down
Laid in a grave, then He raised, now He reign now
I'm a tell everybody till I'm in the green ground
Hold on to your validation, I don't need a thing now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Aye I don't owe nobody but I paid my dues
Got my Hill Street Blues out there on iTunes
Gave 'em plenty Real Talk, and even After the Music Stops
Your boy still a Rebel, you hear it after the music drops
I'm not a mogul, a celeb, a star
I'm some of what you think I am and none of who you are
You barely do collabos, now everybody mad at you
We out to make disciples, not earn these rappers' gratitude
Start messing with PRo, now people they get to hatin'
They say I changed the style, they missin' the whole equation
We chopped it in the Scriptures, we barely talk rap
I told them "get from around me if you just did it for that"
Aye, the homie listened, he struggled, he grew
And now I'm blessed to have him rolling with me and my crew
He went from exalting self to giving glory to the Heir
If you like the old PRo, sorry... he's no longer there

[Hook]
