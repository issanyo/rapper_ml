[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Dear you, Yeah you
The person listenin'
It's God usin' me, tryna' get your attention, yeah
See, He remembers the first day that He made you
Moldin' your lungs for the breath that He gave you
Not to mention the day He saved you
Or when He opened your eyes by the Spirit, Christ was raised through
Did I mention that He forgave you?
And had His flesh ripped off for the sin you was a slave to?
Now it seems you're too far gone
You wanna turn back, but you're not sure if you'll be welcome home
So you figure you'll just leave it alone
But you're addicted to yourself, we both know you can't see it alone
This is an intervention, Jesus intervened
He intercedes on behalf of a sinner's deeds
This is an intervention, because the Lord hurts
Before it gets worse, stomach another verse

[Hook: Chinua Hawk]
Most times I'm paying no attention
Lose my direction
All I chase is vanity
I forget I've been forgiven
Your love I've been given
Your grace on me lavishly
You were born on earth
On my cross You died for me (cross you died)
Forgive my depravity
Lord You are my reality
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Cold water we drink
Hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothin' it just sits and it looks
And that's you, imagine these as the words of Christ
I remember you love Me, I remember your light
It used to shine bright, but now it's so dim
It used to be about Us, but now its 'bout them
You can't win playin' heart games
But I love you even when your lights off in your dark shame
When you lay down and profane Me
Or when your bloodstream contains the things that would defain me
When nobody knows that you claim Me
Or when you mess your life up, get mad, and wanna blame Me
I still want you back
I won't punish you
I took that on the cross because I wanted you
I might discipline and chastise
But if you got what you deserve you'd be in hell with other bad guys

[Hook]

[Lecrae]
You made it this far
And thats a big move
But your addiction is hurtin' your other friends too
Some of 'em miss you
Some of 'em dissed you
But they was hurtin', strugglin' to forgive you
And they hated how addiction got the best of you
Chose a lie when God promised the best for you
If you realize you livin' in sin
Just confess and realize you're forgiven of sin

[Hook]
