[Intro]
And I ain't sellin work
But I give 'em the business

[Verse]
You hear me talkin'
I'm on that peace talk
They ain't used to it
All they know is piece talk
9 Milli on tha piece with tha rhinestones
Welcome to my timezone
None of that in my rhymes yo
I'm on that life change
That real talk
That God work
That shake tha city
That re-build
That be healed
That hard work
I don't hustle hope
Don't peddle religion
And I ain't sellin work
But I give 'em the business

[Outro]
They like, "What you think you doin' puttin' hope in your rhymes?
