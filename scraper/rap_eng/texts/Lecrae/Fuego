[Verse 1: KB]
Look, I’m all in it
Preach Jesus till I’m short-winded
Come God-sippin' pouring up living water in lyrics
This ain’t rap this bartending
And I’m back in the back snapback to the back
With a pack full of cats that’ll strap with the fact
Christ when he ask to revive in the tracks
Turn their life into maps with the gospel we pack
Look I’m of one life
But for Him I spend every cent though
I know this life it comes with pain
But it’s through our pain we win doe
Could be made like Him so
Treat these streets like flint bro
Cause our God can spark up the dark
In the hearts of the hardest departed let’s go

[Hook: Natalie Lauren & Lecrae]
Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Never been here before
Left foot tell the right foot to go
See the whole world coming through the door
Footloose don’t nobody care no more
Come on go hard til the end don’t quit it
Sky too close now go head get it
World’s the same it’s all a game
Look at a stranger go change a thang
Get up! The sky gon burn tonight
Ye know ya’ll going to learn tonight
Feed the hungry and touch the sick
We gon help the homeless and love the kids
We gon move to a place where it’s hard to live
And folks die young and they learn to kill
Light the sky up change your bio
Live for something more than things you buy up
Serve and save learn and change
Trust in the king who can turn this thang
Yeah they ain’t ever seen a shine like this
Look up they never see the sky like this
I’m on and this little light I got
I'mma let it shine til the day I drop
Heart quit pumping only way I stop
Til then I’m a light post on your block

[Hook: Natalie Lauren & Lecrae]
Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
See I don’t want no regrets
No turning back I'mma go and impress
Even if I lead the whole world in press
That ain’t going to put my soul to rest
Keep the name keep the fame
World too cold so I keep the flame
Ever seen a child ain’t eat for days
Promise you ain’t ever gon leave the same
Hands and feet, it seems to me
The world is a mess gon sweep the streets
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDs
Make a brother wanna stay on tour for days
When I get home and things are wrong
There’s two shot dead right around my zone
Ya I pray but faith is dead
If I don’t get up and go work my legs
Torches high light the sky
116 no shame tonight
Ya they ain’t ever seen a shine like this
Look up ain’t ever see the sky like this
I’m on and this little light I got
I'mma let it shine til the day I drop
Heart quit pumping only way I stop
Til then I’m a light post on your block

[Hook: Natalie Lauren & Lecrae]
Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)

[Outro: Natalie Lauren & Lecrae]
Treat every night like it’s the last night
Like it’s the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let’s set ablaze the sky
Passions are fire bright and we’ll be burning forever
(Light up the night) Set the world on fire, let’s set the world on fire (4x)
