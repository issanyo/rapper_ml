[Intro]
Grace through faith
I talked to a cat the other day and he was like, "Man I really wanna come to Christ, but I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together."
I told him, "I used to think that way, too. I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ, but Christ changed me. Let me tell you my story, it starts like this:"

[Verse 1]
It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'
Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'
Havin' visions in my head of a kid
Cryin' at the feet of the Father for all the wrong things that he did
Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets, can't sleep
My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep
Don't remind me, even though I'm still alive I can't tell
The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to Hell
God, they tellin' me I should accept You
That You had to leave the world, 'cause the world left You
Reason I can't change, like a mystery to me
So I make believe there really is a Heaven for a G
Even though they say You loved the world so much You shed Your blood
God, I feel I'm too messed up for love
They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke
My whole life's full of sin, 'cause it's all I know
The Bible told me that You died for my sins
If I believe in Christ to save me from the end
But I'm scared to ask You to save me, my heart so evil
I got thoughts, that's full of hatred hurtin' people
I thought that first I had to clean up my life
Now I'm here and I just need to cling to the light
I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand
My life is a mess, will you take me as I am?

[Hook]
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?

[Verse 2]
I'm sick and tired of tryna be the man my daddy never taught me to be
I'm grown up now, life ain't what I thought it would be
I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix
Now I'm starin' at this crucifix tatted on my wrist
Is it true what they tellin' me, am I just crazy?
Did You bleed on the cross for my sins to save me?
But why would You die for me?
My whole life I've been workin' for Satan while he fed lies to me
And now I'm hearin' too much, tryna get a true touch
Of a love that can change me, I'm all screwed up
Figure Hell is what I deserve
But Your Word says we all fall short, so I guess we all ought to burn
Teach me I wanna learn
How You could save a wretch like me before death says it's my turn
I think I finally understand
No matter my past, You'll still take me as I am

[Hook]
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?

[Verse 3]
If I was dyin', had a few last words to give
I be tellin' people the reason to live
The reason to die, united with the King in the sky
This life is passin' us by, I got no reason to lie
You'll never give the world enough, they'll hunger for more
They'll figure their ways are nothin' to the wondrous
Lord
More security than the man that left you
More love than the moms who kept you, He'll always accept you
Be everything you're supposed to
Let Christ rule your heart, mind, body, and soul 'cause He chose you
And if the world don't know you
It don't matter you're Gods child, And He'll never disown you
Your purpose on Earth is far from worthless
That's why you glorify like your life's been purchased
And it don't matter if the world don't see us
We still mean the world to Jesus
He'll take you as you are

[Hook]
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?
I know the way I'm livin' is wrong
But I can't change on my own, tryna make it alone
I wonder, how could You love me when my life's so ugly?
But You came down and died for me
Will You take me as I am?

[Outro]
Yeah, we're saved by grace through faith. It's not works. Ain't nothin' you can do, ain't nothin' I can do that could get us this great salvation that we got, man. It's only Christ. So, if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up before you can come to Him, forget it, just come to Him. He'll take you as you are. He'll change you from inside, out
