[Hook: Chris Lee]
Girl I love you
Cross my heart and hope to live
To make you
Smile
Cause I don't deserve you
For all the times you held me
Down
Listen to me now, I love you girl

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
You know I had to do a love song
And let the whole world know bout my love y'all
Love sick is what I told the
Doctor
We could be more like Sho Baraka
But we are Moore's and we been that
And when I said I do, I meant that
It's a trip that you let me lead you
Cause I’m a mess and sometimes I need you
And I need you, to understand
That
(I'm dying everyday trying to be a better man)
I put that on my momma
I love the way you play your part through my drama
Long nights, long flights
Trips out of town
You keep my head up when it was hanging down
Down like four flats on a lack
I let you down and you still keep coming back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Out here trying to save the world
Can't forget about my baby girl
And baby girl, you so tight it's true to me
Sometimes I wonder why you fool
With me
Cause foolishly I’m prone to hurt you
Call you grace cause I don’t deserve you
I recall cold nights, no lights, low dough nights
You ain’t fussing you was there through the whole night
Saying it's alright
So faithful, far as beef yeah we done had a plateful
But we ate it up and we made it up
Cause our view of the Lord wasn’t great enough
No divorce cause what God put together
We will never tear apart, we gonna fight and never let up
And when I get up I'm back down on my knees
Thank God my rib's the best part of me

[Hook]

[Outro: Lecrae]
All the fellas out there in the world
If your lady love God and you got a good girl
Stay wit her, pray wit her, take her on a date
Tell her you appreciate

How she love me how she cares
And how she's every woman everywhere
And baby I'm sorry for all the days
I let you down but I got something to say
I love you girl
I love you girl
You know that I love you girl
I love you girl
