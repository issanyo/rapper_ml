[Intro: KB]
Aye, one time for the hometeam
You know what I mean?
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Ride

[Chorus: Lecrae & KB]
I rep for the hometeam (rep it up)
Reppin' the hometeam (rep it up)
I'm reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
You think you could hold me? (bump)
Reppin' the hometeam (bump, bump)
Goin' in OT
I'm reppin' the hometeam (rep it up, rep it up)
You think you could hold me? (ride) (woo!)
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT (yeah)
Hometeam, hometeam (yeah), hometeam goin' OT (woo!)
Hometeam, hometeam (yeah), hometeam goin' OT (yeah)
Hometeam, hometeam (oh yeah), hometeam goin' OT (ride)

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Hometeam, hometeam, don't know your team (don't know 'em)
We been goin' hard since '03
Mic drop, Kobe
They can't stop us, they can't hold me (nah)
Don't mistake me for the old me
This that new edition only
Bobby Brown my Tenderoni
Might just David your Goliath
Chopped the head off of a giant (ugh)
You ain't messin' with beginners, we in here to win it, ooh, I wish they'd try it
Yeah, I done took a few losses
Worked even harder in the offseason
Then I came back feelin' awesome
Now watch me, I'm 'bout to boss up!
Beast mode in the back field, you know my team got the sauce
I look up to Jesus and Iverson
Ooh, that's a mean double cross
My team got tunnel vision
Always see us win, win, win
Your team never showed up
Where y'all been, been, been?
Ride

[Chorus: Lecrae & KB]
I rep for the hometeam (yeah)
Reppin' the hometeam
I'm reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
You think you could hold me? (woo!)
Reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
Goin' in OT
I'm reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
You think you could hold me? (ride) (woo!)
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT (yeah)
Hometeam, hometeam (yeah), hometeam goin' OT (woo!)
Hometeam (hometeam), hometeam (yeah) (hometeam), hometeam goin' OT (yeah)
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT

[Verse 2: KB]
Yeah, so, you wanna bring war?
I got the, I got the faith
Saint Nicholas down in the Bay, they say I gotta slay
Say they wanna bring war
You gon' need more light
You gon' need more, yeah
You gon' need more
You gon' need to be more street lord
C4, police force, Marine Corp
Better bring forth your resource
Look at the report, no record, destroy your retort
It's a breeze like a D.R. resort, like oh—
We are [?] and you ain't never had our joy, on the come up
Cross 'em all up, died on the T
Life gave us lemons, flick it in the Arnold Palmer
Porsches eloquent, horses pedallin'
Trunk in the front, call it elephant
Ain't competitive, we want a white horse
With angels ahead of it reverin'
That's what we like here
Team savage like we lighters
Can't toy with the story, Gospel will buzz for lightyears
Can a brother float his presidential wife here?
I feel I can't lose
Nothing left to prove
Halle-Hallelu—
HGA reppin' the state like D.A
Simple fee day, fee day, VA
Rich mind in the grace, the grace
Squad won't behave in the A
In the Father, been a teammate, teammate
Comin' out your PA, be great, be great, Jesus

[Chorus: Lecrae & KB]
I rep for the hometeam (yeah)
Reppin' the hometeam
I'm reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
You think you could hold me? (woo!)
Reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
Goin' in OT
I'm reppin' the hometeam (yeah)
You think you could hold me? (woo!)
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
Hometeam, hometeam, hometeam goin' OT
