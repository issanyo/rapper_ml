[Hook: Dillavou]
We are children of the light
Royal rulers of the day
Saints, no prisoners of the night
Trust and love will lead the way
We are free

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, I notice when people notice me
My exterior is the only way they know it's me
I'm full of holes and scars, my skin's marked up
But qualified to light up a world of darkness
A day walker, I love walkin' in the sunlight
I look dirty but I've been cleaned on the inside
It's revolutionary, he's coming now for fellas and they can look at us strange
But ain't nothing that they can tell us, cause

[Hook: Dillavou]
We are children of the light
Royal rulers of the day
Saints, no prisoners of the night
Trust and love will lead the way
We are free

[Verse 2: Robby Jerome]
We children of the Light, right
Shine bright, campfire
We out at night, with His blood on us
But naw we ain't no vampires, look
They say that nothing travels faster than the speed of light
I guess that's why I be on different flights preachin Christ
Carry the torch (torch)
Hoping you get scorched (scorched)
I got called and got hauled (hauled)
I hope you don't get forced, look
They tried to put my fire out till it was gone away
But Jesus brought it back like trick candles on a birthday cake

[Outro: Dillavou]
Him the only one to take me out of Babylon
And Him create me right and wrong
And Him create me script and song
And that's why we stand firm upon the rock on which salvation, man
And so we love the prospect and hope to put our helmet on
And that is why we build upon for each and every chosen one
Respectful to the elder-men who give guidance and correction
So don't you quench the Spirit man
The Word is truth, the Word is one
The Messiah give you SHALOM
