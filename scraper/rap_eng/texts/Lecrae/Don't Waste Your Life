[Intro: Lecrae]
Don't waste your life, man

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I know a lot of people that are scared they gon' die
Couple of 'em thinkin' they'll be livin' in the sky
While I'm here livin', man, I gotta ask Why?
What am I here for? I gotta figure out
Waste my life? No, I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gon' do about
Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21 you really oughta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryna show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of any women or men that you admire
It ain't no lie, we created for Him
Outta the dust He made us for Him
Elects us and He saves us for Him
Jesus comes and He raises for Him
Magnify the Father, why bother with something lesser?
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrect Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man, I know I got Christ
If you don't' see His ways in my days and nights you can hit my brakes, you would stop my life
Then I lost my rights, lost my life
Forget the money, cars, and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that'll cost that price

[Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life

[Verse 2: Dwayne Tryumf]
Armed and dangerous
So the devil just can’t hang with us
Christian youth them a stand with us
Livin' and driven, given a vision
Fullfillin' the commission He handed us
London to Los Angeles
The rap evangelist
My Daddy wouldn't abandon us
I got a backpack full of tracks, and I keep a Johnny Mac
So are you ready to jam with us? So let's go
Give me the Word and let's go
Persecution–let's go
Tribulation–let's go
Across the nation–let's go
Procrastination–best go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for the young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows
How many souls are going to Hell or to Heaven so we gotta go in and get 'em

[Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
You tryna figure what to do with your life
You make a lot money? Hope you doin' it right because the money is God's, you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride?
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The color of your skin, nah, you Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money, start living for a car
Get 'em a wife, a house, kids, and a dog
When they retire they livin' high on the hog
But guess what? They didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ, and that's Paul, I recall
To die is gain, so for Christ we give it all
He's the Treasure you can never find in the mall
See, your money, your singleness, marriage, talents, your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See, my whole world is built around Him
He's the life in my lines
I refuse to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time cause I'm constantly tryna be used to praise the Christ
If He's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by His grace you could put your faith in a place that rules your days and nights

[Chorus: Cam]
Don't wanna waste my life
