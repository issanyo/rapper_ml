[Hook: Von Won]
Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
They say the boy's ridin' clean
But without the King, what does it really mean
Cup full of lean, got a sweet full of green
Wake up, boy this ain't a dream
Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
I’m praying for H-Town, yeah, yeah
Welcome to H-Town whoa, yeah

[Verse 1: Dre Murray]
Roaming ‘round the earth
Thinking ‘bout my city, yeah the place of my birth
Every time I hear the name I get a pain in my shirt
Right next to my heart like a flame and it hurts
Ignored it at first but, now I think it’s something I must address
The right spot to get this thing off of my chest
The caged bird won’t be able to sing until it rests
If you just give me a chance to explain, I’ll do my best
Explain to you why I left, He orders my steps
To expound any further would be a waste of breath
The story’s a little bit more than it seems, it has some depth
It’s like I haven’t waken up from a dream, quiet is kept
Nevertheless baby I love H-Town
Pray for my city when my knees hit the ground
I pray you find a savior like I did, H-Town
‘Cause when He come through, man it’s going down

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I was born in H-Town, starched down way back
When them slabs in the city beat that screw off in the back
Poking eye, keep them spinners, eating Frenchy's chicken dinner
Family came from 3rd Ward Scott Street on up to Ennis
Hanging out on Sunnyside with my cousin Corey
They was on that purple Sprite, I was still sipping 40s
Keke's still pimpin' stories as I'm passing by Yates
Stop and wonder if I'll ever enter Heaven's gates
I told my cousin D at TSU "I smoke trees
I think the Lord is calling me, both of us are agree"
And, man, I love the city of my birth, that's why I plea
That God will change the H, same way He's changing me!
'Cause all I cared about was riding clean
A pocket full of green, and find a bad yellow
I can put up on my team
My bros riding dirty, know your soul ain't clean
Aye gon' let the Lord intervene!
I'm praying for H-Town

[Hook 2: Von Won & Shei Atkins]
Welcome to H-Town, yeah, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa, yeah
They say the boy's ridin' clean, fresh up on the scene
But without the King, what does it really mean?
Cup full of lean, got a sweet full of green
Wake up, boy this ain't a dream
Welcome to H-Town, yeah yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa, yeah
I’m praying for H-Town, yeah, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa, yeah

[Verse 3: Dre Murray]
I had a dream on the plane that I was sitting in the slabs
Seat back, face up, chunkin deuce and givin dap
Talking to my patnas 'bout this plans that I have
When I told them "Oklahoma" mayne them boys just laughed, like
"Where there at, folk? " "man, you've been joking" "yeah, you, but you ain't get dope"
It's like they didn't understand me I've been that hope trying to serve God
They want me serve the things with that dope, a job while we flat broke
Pass the kill. And as I got higher, that's when I started to feel "dawg, we smoking kill"
I backed away from the killa, He picked up my life and my vision got clearer
Destiny is screamin it's fate, but I hear her, things are bad right now
But the man in the mirror is trying to make a change, rearrange some things
H-Town, I still love you, hold up, mayne
