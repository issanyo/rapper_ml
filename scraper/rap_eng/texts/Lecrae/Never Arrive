[Intro: Lecrae]
Unh, yeah
Breax, Crae

[Hook: J.R.]
We haven't made it cause we're on your radio
Started at the bottom, see how far we're gonna go
But we haven't arrived yet, yeah
No we'll never arrive, yeah, yeah
I know you think that I'm a star when you see me at my shows
But I'm giving all I am so that you can fill my soul
But I haven't arrived yet, yeah!
No I'll never arrive, yeah
But I'm almost there

[Verse 1: Ruslan]
And it feels like
I'm in a race with time with adjacent minds
Tryna conserve but I keep on wasting time
Never arrive, but I'm never late though
I wanna see my life overflow when the light grows
Believe it cause they say so
They prayin' to Jesús then
Over indulging off of grape juice and Grey Goose
Stay loose
Life assembled by staples
Desire to have strong roots like trees that are maples
They got me figured out like they know what I think
I blink and end up on the verge of my brink
Sometimes it feels like my body holds me hostage
And Lord if you don't rescue me then send me home on hospice
Tired of the hospital wanna see the front lines
Wanna see some action, please help me touch minds
But first You gotta touch mines
But first I gotta slow down
And stop thinking I have it figured out or I know how
To grow now don’t mean I’m gonna blow now
Just cause I'm stepping on stages for shows that are sold out All faith no doubt unashamed not proud
This is just the beginnin', first innin'
No outs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah, they look down on a artist when he’s SO-LOW
But look up and it’s still a long way to go
My minds scrabbling, hopin' my rhymes (are) javelin
Darts to the hearts of people who (are) time traveling
Sometimes I write it and the people like it
But late at night I hit the lights and find I’m still fightin'
I’m still climbin', hopin' I don’t hit my peak 'for I get a peek
At the mountains of life’s peak
I know it sounds deep, but maybe we too shallow
Maybe we too consumed with chasin' a fools shadow
Some people say you made it
No, I’m something in the making
'Til my body hit the pavement
My spirits elevated, I ain't arrive
I ain't the guy with the hypnotized mind
Eyes blind from the shine of both of the worlds dimes
I’m chasin' something so divine
I climb 'til I feel myself declining, I die
Without standing on top of the worlds shoulders
They cold but I know that my moment is even closer
I don’t anticipate seeing from the top down
I’m still riding with my top down! Crae!

[Hook]

[Bridge: J.R.]
See, you don’t even know what it takes
To get where you wanna be
And live out all of your dreams
Cause you can spend a whole lifetime giving your heart and Still not see the root of it all
But you gotta keep going on
Cause you can spend a lifetime giving your heart
And you can see all that you would no long
But you gotta go on, but you gotta go on…
