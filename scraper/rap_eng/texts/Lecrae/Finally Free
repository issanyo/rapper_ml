Lord I pray
You wash away
All these things
I’ve got on me Cause
I’m afraid to walk away
From the man
I used to be
So break away all these chains
So I can finally be free I’m finally free (2x)

They go platinum around the world
I go wood in the hood Still good if
I can’t be what they think I should Shoot
I used to work security that was my night job
Hating every minute of it hoping
We got robbed Mad at my bosses
Taking plenty losses
Sick of seeing these drug dealers riding by flossing
What I go to school for? Just to pay these school loans?
Plotting on the hustle but I’m knowing that ain’t cool though
One of my friends got sentenced for years
I ain’t right enough I was being selfish it’s clear Yo E if you listening I apologize I was running from the old me
Tryna follow Christ You was with me in them streets
You took them blows for me
The least I could done was try to hold you down my G
I got love for you hoping you see what happened in time
We both guilty I just been acquitted of mine

I’m free

Lord I pray
You wash away
All these things
I’ve got on me Cause
I’m afraid to walk away
From the man
I used to be
So break away
All these chains
So I can finally be free
I’m finally free (2x)

Hey yo this verse is for my siblings
Wish that we was closer
Momma said she think that it will happen
When we older But truth be told
We would prolly be close
If the old me was still here but now
He’s a ghost I know I was the catalyzer starting all the trouble And now my life changed and I'm steady on the hustle                                    Be wanting to call more but I don't know what to say                                But your name is on my lips every night that i pray
