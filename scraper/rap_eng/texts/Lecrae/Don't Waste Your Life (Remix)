[Intro: KB]
Same as don't waste your life, man
(HGA)

[Verse: KB]
I know a lot of people man, they scared they gon' die
A couple of 'em think they be livin' in the sky
While I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why?
What am I here for? I gotta figure out (waste my life)
Nah, I gotta make it count
If Christ is real homie, what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 24:32-36? You really gotta go and check it out
But if you know I gotta take every opportunity that I get to witness for that testimony of the one Christ
If anybody was every waitin' for me to talk about another person my question would only be why
Is there, anybody like Him?
Makin', you give something that's already His
Better than pretty women, sinnin' for a minute
Livin' for His glory cause my sins have been forgivin'
See I started college at age sixteen
Turn eighteen with a college degree
Go to any school in the state that I please
American dream, man that was so me
Cute wife who watches her calories
By the pool type, bangin' salaries
Got saved, everybody got mad at me (I threw it all away)
Cause I went to Bible college for theology
They say livin' for Christ is to limit your life
But when did we start takin' sinners advice?
Should we consult the dead on behalf of the livin'
When they don't know what livin' is like?
You wanna pass the baton, with a faith that acts like the book after John
Regenerated, graft indicated, debated and hated baby, but I never wanna waste my life

[Outro: Cam]
Life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my life, life, life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life, life life
Don't wanna waste my life, life life
Don't wanna waste my life, life life
Don't wanna waste my, don't wanna waste my
Don't wanna waste my life
