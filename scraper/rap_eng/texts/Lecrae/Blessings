[Verse 1: Rexx Life Raj]
Look, what's up with all of my dogs? (what's good with my niggas?)
Although we we don't talk
Just know it's still love and it's no feelings lost (It's love, yeah)
I'm at a loss, sacrifices come with being a boss
Literally, I don't take a day off
Literally, I mean spirtually
I been losin' myself in material things
Grab a hold of me, I'm out of control
Pressuring demons are taking a toll
Trying to live forever in a rhyme
But I see the temporariness in life
I'm from where niggas die before they grow
Heavenly bodies from catching a body
I lost a lot lookin' at Devin body
I promise, I never wish death on nobody, ooh

[Bridge: Rexx Life Raj]
Out of the way, I've been out of the way
Getting my mind right
I could feel it getting crazy
I've only seen glimpses of limelight
But whatever I'm ready for
Papa told me I'm headed for
All the insomnia lead to paranoia
Why sleep when there's heaven for
Why sleep when there's heaven

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Blessings, rain down on me
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Blessings
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Blessings

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Pray you don't end up alone
Make a mistake and break up a good home
25 Lighters on the dresser
Burned bridges, now they almost gone
And lately been thinking a lot
Really been praying a lot
Talking to God about how I don't think I'm enough
For all of the blessings I got, yeah
I been wrestling' with finding Pops
Show him all the healed scars I got
He was never worthy in the first place
Could've came home after first base
Three strikes, homie, three strikes, homie
All I need, then it's lights out, homie
To the other side, on my mother's side
Family members beefin', sneak dissin'
Over secrets people keepin'
Put some money in they pockets
Keep em' eatin' put some money on they books
Know the smiles probably cover dirty looks, yeah
I can't erase all my errors
Know I can only get better
And sometimes that pain that you goin through is the greatest pleasure

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Blessings, rain down on me
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Blessings
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Blessings

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
Blessings, I need the blessings
Why do we deal with oppression?
Why am I always the one that's gettin' arrested?
It's out of the question, yeah
It ain't no love, niggas ain't' dumb
We get the message, yeah
Look out for the young, show em' the way
In seek of progression, yeah
We full of agression
All of the shit that we had to endure
Aye, I used to dream of all the things I couldn't afford
Two on the couch, one in the chair
We on the floor, yeah
And I used to steal whatever I could
When we in the store, yeah
We went to war, but funkin' ain't out of the norm
I'm from the pace where you need a thing
In case you was never informed
Honda accord, 'member the Honda Accord?
Now, it's exotics and foreigns
Aye, know that we got it for sure
Blessings

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Blessings, rain down on me
Rain down on me, rain down on me
Blessings
Rain down on me
Rain down on me
Blessings

[Verse 4: Rexx Life Raj]
Blessings
Cause' I kept it real, ain't no counterfeiting
I figured it out, I'm good with the algorithm
And I found a rhythm
Smartest people I know
They been in and out the system
Never had assistance, never had it poppin'
Never had a Christmas
Never had a chance, so they took a chance
Easy to judge with yo' lookin' ass
Still don't see the shit you lookin' past
Wonder why I got the luck of the draw
Look at the homies and somethin' is off
Ball in my hand, I don't plan on fuckin' it off
Tie a girlie with the grip
Big, black with the dreads
"He's surely with the shit"
Hell nah, suck a dick
I know they try to profile me
Profille disagree while you at it
Profile my company and all the equity that I been adding
We're young, black, and getting active
Bless the young niggas with a passion
Fuck the thought of being a statistic
We causin' static, yeah, I should get it tatted

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (Blessings)
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (Blessings)
