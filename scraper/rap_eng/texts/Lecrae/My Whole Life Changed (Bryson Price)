[Verse 1:]
Now stop, y’all don’t quite understand the story I got,
I once popped a whole thing of pills in hopes that I drop,
My cousin walked out a party, bow, got shot

[Chorus:]
My whole life changed (that's when),
My whole life changed (that day),
My whole life changed (right there),
My whole life changed
My whole life changed (that's when),
My whole life changed (that day),
My whole life changed (right there),
My whole life changed,
alright now stop!


[Verse 2:]
That light came and struck me,
Like lightning, that light came and struck me,
My life changed, and then suddenly,
I met The Lord and it wasn't even a Sunday


Look, I came from a past so shameful,
Took advantage of the girls by the handful,
Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice,
Like lightning, that light came and struck me,
My life changed, and then suddenly,
I met The Lord and it wasn't even a Sunday
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus,
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces,
That's gon' rust and fade when you cease,
Maybe, one day, someday, you'll give ya' life up to Jesus,
Instead of giving ya' life up to pieces,
That's gon' rust and fade when you cease

[Chorus]
Let's just say I saw the light,
Let's just say I heard the TRUTH,
Let's just say I ain't' the same no more,
I'm out here looking new,
Let's just say I left the game,
Take my jersey, I retired,
Let's just say I'm at the game,
Put me in I'm on fire
