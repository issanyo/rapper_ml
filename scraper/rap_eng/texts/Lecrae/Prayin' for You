[Intro]
Father, God I–I'm prayin' to you for somebody who knows You, Lord, but just haven't–hasn't been seein' You in the right view lately. Hear me out...

[Verse 1]
Father, I'm prayin' for a friend, he and I are pretty close
And out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily, but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His faith's weak, he ain't prayed in a week
He wake up and just weep with his face in the sink, Lord
You gotta help my man, I'm prayin' for him daily
He ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even hit up the mall
'Cause every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off
Videos just make him feel like he ain't really nothin' without money, girls, and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man 'cause he ain't have a 5-year plan
Or a piece of land
And, man, it's crazy 'cause his family thinks so much of him
Plus he got a godly wife who always show her love for him
But he's strugglin', even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta be
I'm scared for him 'cause there's people that look up to him
He got some younger siblings who've been changed by what he's done for them

[Bridge]
But is it done for him?
Lord, don't let it be
If he don't wanna talk to You then, Father, hear from me
Is it done for him?
Lord, don't let it be
If he don't wanna talk to You then, Father, hear from me

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, uh, yeah
I'm prayin' for you
Uh, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you

[Verse 2]
God, his condition has worsened since we was last conversin'
I'm with him now, he ain't doin' well, of this I'm certain
He say he tryna trust You, doesn't wanna disgust You
But he was in the midst of sinners and did not discuss You
And just today his anxiety's got the best of him
He knows Christ, but for hours refused to rest in Him
He's not the best of men, but Lord, I know he really loves You
And I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin' of You
People trust this dude, you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of You, I pray You touch this dude
What can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him
Father empty and break him, I pray You'll just have Your way with him
'Cause there's a change in him, and the effects are strong
I pray You'll open up his heart before the next song
And when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter You wrote and soak it up
'Cause he ain't hearin' You, and he ain't feelin' me
And God I know it's killin' You, because it's killin' me
And matter of fact there's something else he's concealin', see
The person that I've been prayin' about is really me

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you, uh, yeah
I'm prayin' for you
Uh, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah, yeah, I'm prayin' for you
