[Intro: Lecrae]
Uh! Britt
'crae
Ready, or not
Yeah, lets go!

[Verse 1: Britt Nicole]
I tried to cover my shine
I tried staying in the lines
I, I, I don't wanna hide
No, not tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box right
I want you to look at me in the eye-eye-eye-eye

[Chorus: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not
Here-here-here-here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh
Ready or not
Here-here I come
This is who I am, I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here-here I come
I'm a show the world where the love is (love is)

[Verse 2: Britt Nicole]
I'm not ever sellin' out
A love out loud, is what it's all about
Givin' everything, to see the lost get found (get found)
Yeah, it's going downnn

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you want me to take my light, light
Fit it in your box right
I want you to look me in the eye-eye-eye-eye

[Chorus: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not
Here-here-here-here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh
Ready or not
Here-here I come
This is who I am, I won't hide it
I'mma take it all over the world
To the young, to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here-here I come
I'm a show the world where the love is

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I refuse to keep this burried deep inside of me
Yeah this little light of mine, it's time to let it shine a bit
'cause there's no point in hidin' it
It's everything I am
The source of all my hope
And it's the reason why I stand
And, and, and I pledge allegiance to being somebody real
There's no more holding it back
I'm showin' 'em how I feel, 'cuz love is more than a word
It's a noun, and a verb, and hidin' it is obsurd (and hiding it is obsurd)
Ya heard

[Chorus: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not (ohhhh)
Here-here-here-here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh
Ready or not
Here-here I come
(This is who I am) This is who I am
I won't hide it (I won't gonna hide it)
I'm a take it all over the world
To the young (young boy), to the old, every boy and girl
Ready or not
Here I come(here I come)
I'm a show the world where the love is (love is)

[Outro]
Ready or not (where the love is)
Ready or not (yeah), I will show where the love is
Ready or not (uuh), (yeah) ready or not not not not not not not
Not not not not not not not not not
(ready, ready) ready or not
