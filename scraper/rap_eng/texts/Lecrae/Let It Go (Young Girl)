[Intro]
Yeah yeah
I'm trying to get through to you, you don't listen
Just hear me out

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
You're too young to look that tired, too sweet to be that sad
Any moment it all could end, so please treat the day like your last chance
I know that's family that you're caring for, I know you're feeling so obligated
I ain't saying don't help at home but your sister's son, you ain't gotta raise him
You sacrificed your life, when she wouldn't even sacrifice her night
You babysitted, playing with him, when she wasn't acting right
Don't you got your own dreams, own goals, it ain't right that you gotta put them on hold
You went to school but now you don't go because you're scared she's gonna leave him home alone
You walking in the crib and she passed out again
Your nephew crying on the floor, his ass is out again
Because she done smoked up all the diaper money
And so you laugh to keep from crying trying act as life is fucking funny
And I know when you showing them love that you're just trying to help
But your life will be passing you by if you don't get it done for yourself
And the way that you're doing it now I'm afraid that it's affecting your health, because you're living for somebody else

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
Young girl, young girl
So much on your plate
And you just one girl, one girl
Life ain't gonna wait for them to let you go
So I think you gotta let it go

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
They don't want you to leave, they want you to stay
But you should be pulling away if nobody is pulling they're weight
And it's okay, you wanna live a little in your own way
Maybe you would get your bills payed if you didn't have to pay for her mistakes
Yeah, and you ?, you worry about them, you're terrified
And you're scared to move like you're paralyzed, and the guilt will eat you like a parasite
She living all reckless, going on benders acting offensive, right
And you've given up friendships, given up men, you've given up every night
And you've given up paychecks, and you pay the rent just save them
She complicating your life because she wanna act so damn basic
And you take it because you want approval
Don't you know that they wanna use you, don't you know that it'll ruin you
And you gotta leave, it ain't wrong to do you
And I know when you showing them love that you're just trying to help
But your life will be passing you by if you don't get it done for yourself
And the way that you're doing it now I'm afraid that it's affecting your health, because you're living for somebody else

[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
Young girl, young girl
So much on your plate
And you just one girl, one girl
Life ain't gonna wait for them to let you go
So I think you gotta let it go

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
It ain't about what you will do or you won't do
But are you willing to do, anything that he want to
Because he don't want you, he want you to just run through, many men, plenty sin, pretty slim chance he'll hold you
He tells you that you're beautiful, he tells you that you're fine
He tells you to go hit the strip and go flip a trick for them dimes
Little mama must be sick, because she's cold than a mother
Looking like her daddy pitching because she throwed than a mother
And you ask her why she do it, say she do it for the money
Plus a couple shots of this and she'll go do it for a hunned
She's a young girl, young girl, no class, dumb girl
But that don't mean you can't change, and that don't mean you're done girl
And I told her "Little mama don't lower yourself to be a esteemed."
You were made in God's image, I can see that in your genes
And they all up in your jeans, but that don't mean you're nothing lesser
I'll leave that money on a dresser, get dressed and keep your respect
Because you's a

And you just one girl, one girl
Life ain't gonna wait for them to let you go
