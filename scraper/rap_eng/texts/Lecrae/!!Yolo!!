You Only live once
So give it up tonight
I hope u live twice
Cuz I don't want to give up this life
All the battles that fight tonight
I'm not dying no I'm not going to the light
God Saved me I'm not going down without a fightÂ 
All this pressure on me I'm just saying sorry
Devil trying to take me but that's not gonna happen
People say he's fake u just got to belive him
He is our creator and I am not a faker but this message that he sent me for is for you to trust in him
He died on the cross for us so show him some respect
He made this world for us if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be here today
He has made this world for us now look what we've done to it
We can make it better we just got to make it happen
He is stronger than the devil he is stronger than my sin
All these sins we've done we just have to ask for forgiveness
All these things people say I just try to get away
Devil try to take me in I'm not going to the fire
I know I'm going to heaven no matter what people say
He is my lord and saviour and I'm not gonna die today no I'm going to the fire
You only live once
So give it up tonight
I hope u live twice
Cuz I don't want to give up this life
I'm done with this message I know my lord will bless it
God love's me and I love him
