Sana- Cruz Alan Na- Savior (Mystical Edition, 2013)
Verse 1
Look take a picture someone mourn in a cavern
Or someone ego hide some stuffs in an oven
But of cavern he will cry think that hopeless
And that egoism should suffer from careless
Behavior of God support all because all are his people
Protect from stumble
What I am mean with this riddle
Development led fella to become jealous
Plot to kills you, no one know even this ominous
All enemies God protect and let them fall
Compare teeth and tongue or water on atoll
Through our obstinacy led us to sin again
Pity on us to resurrect must trespass born again
When I read this scripture think is a magic
Walk on water, exorcism, no doubt he was classic
Of Sodom and Gomorra is like that of cinema
God saves Luth wife unbelief children lost their mama
Word of God can remove all your guilty
Remnant shall return and the city will be rebuild
I will stay with Lord in my whole life
I know will not perish but have eternal life

Chorus
Jesus is the savior, he doesn`t want to suffer anymore
Better get near, escape wrath and be cursed in this world
Evils to the poor, according to God is not good at all
It`s better play smarter, and do what please your Lord
Can make you His child
Be of home not in wild
Takes to another world
And you will not suffer anymore

Verse 2
It`s good to discover
Power of God in your heart not on a cover
Savior of your life least you from stress
And the one whom solve all hard you goanna face
He is not of contract a month or a year
Not of sorrow loneliness or more of tears
Come to you without even a call
What in earth in heaven already been recorded
But can change depend how we please God
Aimed to prevent sin from getting too old
It will be strange this is what we have been told
Nothing can least you even the tons of gold
Respect parents the gods on a earth
Reduce load and guilty to be named a wretch
Another more joy refresh as sunshine
Filthy removed and you will have new ones
Escapes live down and live in a dark
Glitter as moon light even the night
The savior of all without an intimidation
Treat equal to Him thereâ€™s no segregation
Jesus savior, a man of vision
