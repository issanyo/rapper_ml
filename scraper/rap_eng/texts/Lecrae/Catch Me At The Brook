Lecrae:

I used to jack Daniels
Chase bloody Mary
I never touched the virgins – naw they too scary
An enemy of God since the day of my birth
Now I'm a walking Sprite billboard obeying my thirst
My lips used to sip from sick mixed elixirs
Now I big gulp from big spits of scripture
Living Water all in my pitcher, get the picture?
Flowing out my heart is the best kind of addiction

Sho Baraka:
If I go days without seeking His face it starts showing;
A week outside His presence and the world starts knowing
Sometimes my earnest prayer is to erase my brain
Cause 20 years as a pagan got my mind trained
Broke up with the world like "I need my space I gotta breathe"
Then she looked me in my face like "you ain't gotta leave..." ( WHAT??)
The landlord clued me in to your cheatin'
I need more for a reason, so I gots to get leavin'

Hook:
Your face I need to constantly seek
I NEED MORE
Never feel I'm reaching my peak
I NEED MORE
My soul thirsts for You oh Lord
I NEED MORE, I NEED MORE
I'm thirsting after God
Find peace in Your mercy and grace
I NEED MORE
Find shelter in no other place
I NEED MORE
My soul thirsts for You oh Lord
I NEED MORE, I NEED MORE
You can catch me at the brook

Sho:
Forget diamonds, in His presence I stay laced
With a shine like Moses when I'm seeking His face
My gratitude for the Water was
Bottle it up and try to sell it like a telemarketer
Until I die or they martyr us
The Water's aquaphobia - they scared of the Water cuz
So this is how I advertise, you can drink from other sources but your soul's never satisfied

Lecrae:
John 7:37; Psalm 86:11;
Catch me at the brook - take your sins to heaven
Never get enough, Christ fill my soul up;
Cause all the world's wells either dry or they done froze up
Greater than Jacob, look at John 4: 10 and em
Jesus makes an offer – the water's like a synonym
All the women and men who living and sinning(?)
Catch us at the brook where we be getting it into them(?)

Hook:

Lecrae
The worlds at the well looking thirsty
Me I'm at the brook where the church be
Don't need a pool homey Christ's healed me
Used to mess around with coke but His powers the real thing
Don't need a Pepsi to pet me prep and press me to seek him
Like John Knox this guy who told me that I should drink Him
So until I leave the Earth catch me pourin Him up
I got my life turned up homey so is my cup

Sho

Like the deer panteth my soul thirst for you like (yeah)
Make him known in everything we do like (yeah)
Offered living waters to my whole crew we like (yeah)
I carry my cup, I can't get enough
Raise your cup to His authority and power like (yeah)
Found out all day was happy hour like (yeah)
Real talk he turns our lives  up the music drops
You can catch me at the brook after the music stops
