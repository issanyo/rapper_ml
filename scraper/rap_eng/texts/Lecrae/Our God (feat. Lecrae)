[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Chris Tomlin]
Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like you
None like you
Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's No one like you
None like you

[Hook: Chris Tomlin]
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God You are higher than any other
Our God is Healer, awesome in power
Our God, Our God

[Verse 2: Chris Tomlin]
Into the darkness you shine
And out of the ashes we Rise
No one like you
None like you

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Tomlin]
And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us
And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?
And if Our God is for us, then who could ever stop us
And if our God is with us, then what can stand against?
Then what can stand against?

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Hey, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
You know I need You like what
A day without You got me so nauseous
I prolly ain't cautious
[?] my sickness
You know it's true, You as my witness
And You witness
Inconsistence
Yet still pray to You when I need Your assistance
I just gotta know that You even know that I'm a misfit
Still want more the calamity needs this
Some love
I can pursue
I know I can't feel it
I know that it's true
Somebody woke me up
I know it's You
Yet I keep trying to stay clear of Your view
If You keep me, I know You got me
I'm so insecure I can't believe You want me
Then I heard You and Your way and You want to adopt me
You can have it all
Don't drop me
I love You
Hey
C'mon

[Bridge: Chris Tomlin and Lecrae]
