[Intro: Lecrae]
U.K., what's up? We an extreme team, you know what I mean?

[Verse 1: S.O.]
Uh, huh, they say that I'm radical
And I should go on a sabbatical
Go and take a break, go on a paper chase and escape and have a go
My answer's no!
I’m chained up to my Master's throne, a slave loving His Master
Some of my heroes stayed in them catacombs eaten up by them animals
It's radical and outrageous, look how we move, for Jesus has saved us
Move with our Maker, look at our make-up
Live it out gracious, making that statement, stating
Call us names, our call's the same
Not to make way in the hall of fame
But to pray change, it’s all of grace
You can say strange, but I won’t sway

[Chorus: J. Williams]
I’m radical
The way we livin' is not the usual
Invisible, its incredible, I’m radical
No other way I gotta let them know
I’m radical
They can talk if they want
I’m radical
They can never hold me down
I’m radical, I’m radical, I’m radical, I’m radical
Radical, radical
Yes, I’m radical
Radical, radical

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Listen
I, I, I, I’m a radical
Eat that truth like an animal
Spit it out, give it out, live it out, go ahead keep your eyes on my mandible
I pray I never eat my words
The way I’m always telling y'all to read the Word and
Took my faith to places that’s known for hatred for the Truth I heard, yeah
They probably wan' kill Lecrae
'Cause I rep for the Christ and I preach the way
I’ll probably be judged for the things I say
I ain’t scared of the beef though I eat fillet
I ain’t backin' down, I ain’t backin' out
Anything for the King is my rational
U.K. to the A, S.O. unashamed, holla 1:16, be a radical

[Chorus: J. Williams]
I’m radical
The way we livin' is not the usual
Invisible, its incredible, I’m radical
No other way I gotta let them know
I’m radical
They can talk if they want
I’m radical
They can never hold me down
I’m radical, I’m radical, I’m radical, I’m radical
Radical, radical
Yes, I’m radical
Radical, radical

[Outro: J. Williams]
Yeah
I'm radical now
