[Hook: Lecrae]
How could I love you
When all you ever did was wrong
How could I trust you
You lied to me all along
You strung me out

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm goin' through withdrawals
The shakes and all
You did me dirty
I almost died dawg
I let you play me
And plus you gave me
All the filthy things I wanted, all my sinful cravings
But I see you
Yeah you're see-through
Somebody opened up my eyes and I don't need you
I gotta leave you
Before you take my life
I used to date you then I went ahead and made you wifey, yeah
You had me feenin for the stuff you offer
You such a scoffer I know that you want me in my coffin
But girl you already lost it
Your ways are perished
Thank you god for your salvation this is what I cherish

[Hook]
You strung me out [8x]

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Uh, I'm out your grip
I'm out your grasp
You had me mesmerized
You had me in your hands
Luster the eyes
The pride of life
You offered me the world
You made it look so nice
You took me high
But left me down and out
I run right back to you thinkin' that you would help me out
You never satisfied
You only gratified
You just a bad illusion
To every passerby
And I don't want you round
You only bring me down
So glad I quit you I don't miss you cause you had me down
So get gone
Get gone [6x]

[Hook]

[Verse 3 talking: Lecrae]
Do not love the world
Or the things in the world
If anybody loves the world
The love of God is not in 'em
The world is passin' away
Along with it's desires, but
Whoever does the will of God
Will live forever
I know it hurts sometimes
We've gotta go through withdrawals
Cause we've been strung out

[Hook]
