[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Lord, kill me If I don't preach the gospel
I'm still in my twenties, but I'll die if I got to
Eh man, I'm already dead, man, forget my flesh
I done been crossed over, see the full court press
I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
Running from my trials thinkin' everything's groovy
If the cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no more
If I ain't seeing Christ, partner, I don't wanna see no more
Rep Him every day without worrying about a bruising
I been to China, man, I seen some real persecution
If you didn't know Christ, would your life look the same?
Can they tell you value Jesus by the way you rep his name?
Man, what's the point of living if I'm living for myself?
Lord, empty out my life before I put you on the shelf
So for God, I go hard, I don't wanna die tonight
But there's too many people living who ain't heard about the Christ

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Went to Asia had to duck and hide for sharin' my faith
They tell me "Water it down" when I get back to states
They say "Tone the music down, you might sell a lot of records, but it's people out here dying and none of 'em heard the message"
Took my wifey on mission trip in Central America
Shared her testimony, 40 people stood and stared at her
When she said Jesus, should have seen, it was insane
Cause 40 out of 40 never heard of Jesus name
Oh man, we ain't focused on the war we just kickin' it
Worried bout our image and our space up on the internet
Take me out the game coach I don't wanna play no mo
If can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court
Thank you for the Grace for the will and the desire
Got me living for your glory stead of living to retire
But I pray I'll never tire of going hard for Messiah
I don't need no motivation, You the reason I'm inspired

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
Go Hard for the Lord baby 'til He takes us home
Go Hard for the Father baby go on get it on
That's what that is baby, that what that mean, that what that mean
That what That is baby, That what that mean, that what that mean
Wha-What that mean?
That mean that we, should be out up in the streets
Not just in houses with our bible's summarizing what we read
Man this ain't deep (man this ain't deep), why we ain't doing what we read
Its like we sleep (its like we sleep)
But sinners sleepwalk when they sleep
So why can't we (so why can't we), the redeemed of the LORD
Act out, what He said, and make a scene for the LORD
Action-cut, say what, like we was the director
But you better get a Grip like movie sets, and get to stepping (Martin)
I know you done it da-done it, da-done-and heard it all
You was going hard for the Lord before you heard this song
But don't play yourself to save ya self and walk in fear
Scripture's like a mirror, the truth is closer than it appears
