[Intro: Soul Glow Activatur]
I will show you crazy, I'm a maniac
No more final warning, I'm not holdin' back
I ain't goin' nowhere, let the roof cave in
'Bout to blow up somethin', here goes nothin'
Watch me hit the cray button
Cray! Cray! Cray!

[Verse 1: Soul Glow Activatur]
Let's get cray, turn it all the way up
Got a double dose of bass, you love it so much
Get outta your head, get outta your skull
If you ain't gettin' cray, then you ain't got a pulse
A lunatic in town, bomb just got dropped
I get cray all day, it's my full time job
Wild like a wolf pack howlin' at the moon
Attack, attack
You've been bitten by the boom

[Hook: Soul Glow Activatur]
I ain't goin' nowhere, let the roof cave in
'Bout to blow up somethin', here goes nothin'
Watch me hit the cray button
Cray! Cray! Cray!

[Verse 2: Soul Glow Activatur]
Put your fives in the sky if you're feelin' alive
Throw ten up in the air
Cus you don’t care
Cray bands on
Rock your cray on
3, 2, 1, detonation!

[Bridge: Soul Glow Activatur]
I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button
I guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
I wonder what happens if I hit the cray button
I'mma do it!
Watch me hit the cray button

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Wait, wait, wait, hold up let me do my thing
Hit they cray button I was like “you rang?”
Came in the party with a couple of friends
Hollerin 116, yeah we so unashamed
Everybody get cray like me
I’m so cray it’s on my ID
Everybody serious looking for deep material
Chill and turn up the stereo and dance like me
Please don’t wreck the party
Came to have fun 'cause the week was hard
And go nuts, turn up, insane
You ain’t seen nothing we about to go cray
If it gets wild I'mma jump in the crowd
And show the whole front row that I know how to fly
You think we on ten? Boy you ain’t seen nothing
3, 2, 1… cray button

[Outro: Soul Glow Activatur]
I-I hit the cray button
I-I hit hi-hi-hit hit hit
I-I hit the cray button
I-I hi-hit hit
I pledge allegiance to the U.S. Cray (cray)
U.S. cray U.S. U.S. cray
I pledge allegiance to the U.S. Cray (cray)
U.S. cray U.S. U.S. cray
