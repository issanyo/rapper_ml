[String Intro by Danika Lukasiewicz]

[Verse]
Turn the music up inside my session
These folks gotta hear my message
You put that beat on, I beat on this track to relieve my stressin’
I see more trials than Cochran, while TV tryna box me
Them magazines ain't on my page but ain’t none of that gon’ stop me
Keep the fame and acclaim, I won’t be a slave for a chain
And why stay the same for the change, let’s talk ‘bout change for a change
Mundane, killa’ bang, sell cane for the gain, pump vanity in your veins
Know they hopin’ I quit, bet they hoping I die, know they hopin' I'm plain insane
‘Cause they know I ain't playing, got my faith on display
And I got some riders behind me, and they mean what they sayin'
Knock-knock, open up, we at yo’ door, hope you prepared now
And I think it's clear now, partner we here now
And don't plan on goin' nowhere, consider yourself invested
And these strains all up in your veins, consider yourself infected
And what we say we live out, fo' we give in we give out
And when we die we come back, tell death he’ll never win out
They ain't never stop us, pop us, drop us, watch us pop right back up
And we never gon' die, that’s why we ride and rise like Pac got back up
Go'n back up, call back up
Everybody go home, just pack up
We plugged into the Highest power, that why we ain't gotta act tough
No poker faces, just smokin' aces, my house is full
My temple is a dwelling place, my master’s masterful
You just full of yourself, you just food on the shelf
Eatin' for breakfast, talking reckless, boy, I know the chef
You don’t want what he’s cooking, it’s not easy to stomach
And your words will be eaten, folks’ll be reading yo’ vomit
The recipe for disaster asks for blasphemy
And as for me, ask for me, I give you gravity
