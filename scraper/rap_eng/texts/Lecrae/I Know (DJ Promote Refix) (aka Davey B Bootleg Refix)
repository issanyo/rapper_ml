[Intro]
(Tell the)
God made a choice
He loved you so much that He made the choice for you, He gave His son and said
"Receive Him and be saved"
He made the choice to do so because He loves us

[Sample]
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know (I know)
How will I know (I know) (Love can be deceiving) (I know)
How will I know (I know)
How will I know if he really loves me (I know)
I say a prayer with every heart beat (I know)
I fall in love whenever we meet (I know, I know)
(I-I-I-I-I-I know)

First God's Grace

[Verse 1]
Boy I lost and I'm foolish, running off at the two lips
Prolly wooing all the cruelest persecutors to fool us
Catch me hanging with shooters rumored to strew your medulla
My momma told me, told me, told me, I already knew it
Who gon give 'em peace of mind? They can have piece of mine
Know they thinkin' I'm blind, but I just pay them no mind
Yeah I know they be lyin', they misquoting my lines
They like what you think you doin' putting hope in your rhymes?
You would think I'm shooting folk or putting coke in my rhymes
I just give them bass for free and push the dopest of lines
Boy you trippin' (I know)
'Crae you slippin' (I know)
I done heard this all before just sit back enjoy the show
Tell that DJ to bang it!
Tell that DJ to bang it!
Tell that DJ to bang it!

[Sample]
If he loves me, if he loves me not (x4)
How will I know
