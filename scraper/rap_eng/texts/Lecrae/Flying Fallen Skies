[Verse 1]
Heaven’s awaiting
But I here, with the DNA of a cheater
Know I’m bucking every urge
Daily not to be eaten
Grandma left bitter
My mother left wheezing
I’m warring, so my wife
Will never have to know Tina
My Sisters were never edified
I was left heated
Fired the cold in my heart
So my son won’t know fever
Its hard
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t see her
And my pride doesn’t fight
To be main, to make me a cheetah
But for every temptation
Every thirst, every thought
There is Grace, There is Mercy
There is Strength thank you Lord
Won’t play 9, can’t pretend
I’m fallen and life’s yuck
And I’m pressing so that my nature
Doesn’t erupt and leave me stuck
That’s real
I know me
So I know I’m unworthy
It’s only by his blood
That I am no longer dirty
Press towards the mark
And leave my mark while its early
And sing the Gospel from this temple
Shirley
Its On

[Hook]
Wind beneath my wing
For a mighty long way
Going to for hours
It’s been a mighty long day
But the Lord is rest for the weary
We Fly and never faint
Though this Sky is Falling
We will soar, night and day
So all along we sing…

We were, Broken, Torn
Rejected, Hurting, Scorned
But for those with eyes on the Lord
Strength, peace, joy, is in store

So I
Flying Falling Skies (x3)


[Verse 2]
And as this time passes
I know things will get worse
But the Truth, will remain so
So, gone prepare me a Hearst
No, we are not deceived
We know how this thing works
He said all the nations will hate you
Because they hated me first
So were not, chasing your likes
Though we strive, to live in peace
But if that compromises the Faith
Then that peace, shall rest in peace
Deceased, rose in 3
That’s why I, salute the provost
The ghost, about faced me
Set me AJ’s Cohost
Should I never chart
Or be considered the goat
I’m content if me rapping
Can be used to touch a soul
Encourage one of my statesman
Affirm a little girl
Put her on who she is to God
And help keep her off a pole
If I never sell a million
Never pack a show
I’m content with being faithful
Unto the streets of gold
What this world presents
Let my nieces know they’re more
You’re a gift, to be unwrapped
By your husband, none more
Let my nephews know I love them
That I’m always here
A good son to my mother
A brother, loving and fair
I’m content with being a man
Saved by Grace
Father to my son
Just to see that look on his face
When I walk in to this house
He runs up, we embrace
Bless me to love my wife right
In deed, not just what I say
Good name, salt to earth
Servant, warring against the evil
Let people know you love them
And that love, has no equal
So Yeah, its lights bright
The Gospel, front and center
Love, Joy, Peace, Hope
Grace, Mercy and Repentance
Mind Renewal, Spirit purging
Through abiding in the Scriptures
Balance, His balance, suffer well, live wisdom

[Lecrae & Jeremiah Bligen]
Our Money Our Singleness Marriage Our Time
They belong to us to show the world that Christ is divine
That’s why its Christ in our rhymes, that’s why its Christ all the time
We strive to build our world around him he’s the life in our lines
Cut us open, you’ll see we still bleed that here
One sows, another waters, God’ll increase that yeah
Were Clear
Preach on, even with feedback there
Life, light bearing, truth of Jesus, We still need that here

[Da T.R.U.T.H. & Jeremiah Bligen]
We on a roll
Tonic told us to write from our souls
Not to think about the reviews or the albums we’ve sold
So we did that, laid back, prayed to get our focus right
Think about what the culture needs, not just what the culture likes
Yeah, so we draw lines in the sand
That would explain the unpopular stance
Like, pro-life, were un-liked but we stand
And still sing psalms and hymns, like the bottom of pants

[Dre Murray]
When they think were writing, were really just sparring
Warring, flesh dead wrong, Darwin
Politicking with the land
They looking at us like we foreign
Cause we don’t speak the language of the land
They say we boring
Oh well
My life is but a testament to me
To another, maybe everything they’ll ever need to see
So I’m here flying steady
Hail falling, fire beneath
Hoping these seeds take root
Until the Father’s work is complete
Salute

[Hook]
