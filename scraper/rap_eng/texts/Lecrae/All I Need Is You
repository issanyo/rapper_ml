[Intro]
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need
(All I need is)
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
(All I need is)
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, but, all I know
All I need is you...

[Verse 1]
To keep me in my timezone when my mind's gone
And I'm flyin' home and I'm stressed out
And I'm tempted to get that styrofoam and go pour it up
You know what's up
You know that ain't gon' solve nothin'
I mean, Lord forbid, I might fall or somethin'
I'm all or nothin' cause (all I need is)
So hold me down like bed straps at a psych ward
It's killin' me, but you still with me when I fight hard (all I need is)
You diggin' me when I'm iggin' you
Get with me when my car is pulled
Coulda dealt with me, but you fell for me 'fore I fell for you
To keep me on that right path and the right math
Cause you plus nothing's everythin'
You my everythin', sayin' (all I need is)
You ain't gotta question my allegiance
The way you love me I could never leave you, I need you

[Chorus]
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go (all I need is)
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, but all I know (all I need is)
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need

[Verse 2]
We burnin' one for that burn out
This life in God, I'm all turnt out
Took time out to put time in, so I turn to you when I'm worn out
You slow me down cause you know me now with my phony smile
And I'm actin' like it's all copacetic, it's so pathetic, so juvenile
You keep me cool in the summer
When they be dressin' less and I be wantin' to show off and stunt
There ain't nothin' to want, you give me all that I need
And all I need is you to keep that fire burnin' for me

[Bridge]
All I need is you
Ain't nobody gon' get in the way
Put that on my money in the bank
Cause you do what them others canâ€™t, what them others can't
And I love that, yeah
We gon' ride 'til the rims fall off
Above it all, we can never fall, no
Hold my hand, yeah, hold my hand
We can have it all, have it all, have it all

[Hook]
By my side, thick and thin
Highs and lows, don't let go
We gon' ride, we gon' win
Don't know how, but all I know
(All I need is)
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need
All, all, all I need, all I need
All, all, all I need

All I need
