[Intro: Bizzle]
Uh Oh! Yeah!
They been waiting a long time for this one
Crae, let's get 'em! Yeah! Go!

[Hook: Bizzle]
They sayin hip-hop's dead, let it die
This the birth of truth music, the death of lies
God over money, I rap 24/7 boy act like
(you know, you know)
Call nine uno uno, then get them boys new clothes
The game gotta change homie
(you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know)


[Verse 1: Bizzle]
Gimme a minute, I'll spit you this lyrical polygraph
Say you ain't a Christian so you don't listen to godly rap
Only problem I got with that
Is you ain't ever bust your pistol or cut a brick but you filling your iPod with that
Copy that? Your logic is not intact
So miss me with all of that talk, I done ripped on the hardest cats
So ready or not
I am a messenger, they call me a heavenly rapper for God
Whether they're feelin' a cop, I'll give you the business
Quicker than a helicopter, pa-pelican chop
Killin' that crack they sell on the block
Saying they made it, peddlin' rock
Look at they grades, think they in college
But never sayin' that anything wrong
I been to prison, but not for crimes
You went for tickets, and stopped the line
I go to talk to folk all the time that really did what you talk in all your rhymes
And Imma keep it one hunned, Hip hop got me sick to my stomach
Heard y'all mockin' God so don't find it odd
When I'm hoppin' out like Bugs Bunny
And Some will say "That ain't real hip hop,"
Others say "Man it is hip hop,"
If you gonna let Satan kill hip hop to save hip hop, then kill hip hop
Gone!

[Hook: Bizzle]
They sayin hip-hop's dead, let it die
This the birth of truth music, the death of lies
God over money, I rap 24/7 boy act like
(you know, you know)
Call nine uno uno, then get them boys new clothes
The game gotta change homie
(you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Now they tell me "All I talk about is God
Whole flow soundin' like an ad lib from Big Sean"
All I hear on radio, the same song, same sound
Guess we ain't pay enough to hear our music in your town, well
You ain't gotta play my song, I ain't finna pay for spins
Plus that DJ say that he ain't have a say in it
So what you sayin' then? Oh it's the program director
Imma put my fans on his head and tell 'em to spin these records
And I understand why you may not wanna play this in club
Cause the truth in this don't go well with what you tryna bump
DJ, if you could, (record scratch sound) scratch and thug
Us in your playlist we would sho' appreciate the love
It's God Over Money, Unashamed, till we dead and gone
And you know, I had to jump on Bizzle song
Yeah you know, I had to jump on Bizzle song
Yeah, God Over Money baby, let's go!

[Hook: Bizzle]
They sayin hip-hop's dead, let it die
This the birth of truth music, the death of lies
God over money, I rap 24/7 boy act like
(you know, you know)
Call nine uno uno, then get them boys new clothes
The game gotta change homie
(you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know)

[Verse 3: Bizzle]
They like Bizzle why you tryin' a tear a black man down?
Who you think controllin' how that black man sound?
Like, they'll never listen if we tell them kill each other
But if one'll poison a milli I bet they fill each other
Just overlook the doctors and the lawyers of they people
Then take all they criminals and put them in the lead role
Turn the drug dealer from the villain to the hero
We don't keep em down we just keep em anger thief flow
Do promote sex, but don't promote commitment
Have them burning in the hood like a locomotive engine
Tell the boys women ain't nothing, but hoes and tricks, then
Let the women raise them alone, they will never listen
Promote sinnin' as a better way of living
Til they so in love with it they'll go against their religion
You take away Christ then you take away hope
Got a deal, here's a Bentley for your soul. Who wanna roll?

[Hook: Bizzle]
They sayin hip-hop's dead, let it die
This the birth of truth music, the death of lies
God over money, I rap 24/7 boy act like
(you know, you know)
Call nine uno uno, then get them boys new clothes
The game gotta change homie
(you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know, you know)
So act like (you know, you know)
