[Chorus: Lecrae]
I ain't never gon' change, I ain't never gon' change
Folks switchin' up man, wish 'em luck
We just charge it to the game
I ain't never gon' change, I ain't never gon' change
Unashamed, that's the crew
Same me, different you

[Verse 1]
New whip, ain't got no blinkers cause I ain't never switching lanes
It's One Sixteen tatted on the team, boy, you know we unashamed
My day ones know it's real with me
I ain't gotta say they names
And I ain't gotta shout them out on IG
'Cause they ain't lookin' for no fame
Boy they swear I'm playing games
I just tell 'em what they need to do
I'm just goin' where they never go
I'm just sayin' what they need to know
Always in the trenches, 2017 I came up
Same rebel on a different level
Yeah, you know I never change up

[Chorus: Lecrae]
I ain't never gon' change, I ain't never gon' change
Folks switchin' up man, wishin' luck
We just charge it to the game
I ain't never gon' change, I ain't never gon' change
Unashamed, that's the crew
Same me, different you
