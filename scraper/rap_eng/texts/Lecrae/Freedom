[Intro: Lecrae]
Whoo
Yeah, man

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
They out here prostitutin' kiddos
Fill they pockets with dinero
Pedophiles, pitiful
Sell a child to centerfold
Take they innocence, put in on the internet
Purities tainted, dignities shaken
Enslavin' the soul of all of these babies
And freedom got a price nobody payin'
Makin' money, American dream ain't it, nah!
It's a nightmare, don't fight fair for white here
Benjamin Franklins, killin' we hate for him
Write a song justifyin' the lies we take for him, hold up
They ain't with me, I'm willin' to wait for 'em
Lil' me sat up on the porch, thinkin' dolla bills
Stomach filled from another meal that my momma killed still
I can't keep still
I'd probably steal to keep a couple of Nike checks on the back of my heels
Grandma back on them pills
I need a stack of them bills
They say we slaves to the money
I guess we back on the field
I'ma go pursue my happiness, they told me it was free
But I'm still payin' for it, I'm indebted to this thing
Heard a prophet say the profit, don't focus on makin' change
Just focus on tryna be it and maybe you'll make a gain
Maybe you'll free the slaves, maybe you'll bring a change
The destinations are different but everyone's on the train

[Chorus 1: N'Dambi]
Freedom isn't free
But I still, I still believe in my freedom
So my mind can see
Please let me be free, please let me
Freedom

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I'm out here chasin' this freedom
They out here choppin' my feet off
And if they catch me I'm Toby, but I ain't 'bout to believe it
King Kunta, or king of coonin', or Kenan & Kel
Rather rot in a jail cell than be up in hell, well
Well done, is you cookin' or is you hearin' your Father say, "Well done"?
Is He lookin' at all your honors?
Modestly I'll be honest, I'm hangin' onto that promise
'Cause honestly I ain't really been everything that I oughta
Oughta be on my Harriet, bury me next to Honest Abe
Here lies another man murdered for tryna free the slaves
I gave Chief Keef my number in New York this summer
I told him, "I could get you free", I'm on my Nat Turner
Back burner, cookin' up a fat burger
While we shuck and jive to a song about a crack murder
Know we need a change but we threw it on the stage
Got some money and a soul and neither one of us saved
Slaves, get free

[Chorus 2: N'Dambi]
Freedom, it isn't free
But I still, I still believe in our freedom
So my mind can see
Please let me be free, please let me be free
Freedom

[Outro: N'Dambi]
Freedom, freedom, freedom
