[Verse 1]
People wanna know about me the real me
They want me to leave the MC in the booth
If it's for only a glimpse
Even though they want an intense
Look at a life that's so Open Book like my homie Da T.R.U.T.H
So they wanna know Deuce
You have a wife any kids?
What's your struggle?
Da T.R.U.T.H. says that he wrestles with pride
Ambassador what's your frailty?
How do you die daily?
You rock Sean John
Do you like .. the ROC?
Yes I have me a wife
Her name's Michelle, she prefers the name Missy
Got five kids, only the youngest four stay with me
Which leads me to a struggle that's key among many
I havn't done the best job with the son I can't see
I do die daily but if I list 'em
Somebody may listen and begin to judge people with
The standard which is really not commanded but it works for me
And man it's what makes a man or woman what's called a legalist
And I usually like the low roads so yo hold the limo
Yes I pass on many brand names
If the name's primarily connected to a personality who's wickedness is the key to their fame I let it go
But now I'm feelin' kinda funny
This is too much about me
For me every simile and metaphor
Every single hook, every chant, every lyric, every anthem
Should never eclipse the One I want you checkin' for

[Verse 2]
People wanna know about me the real me
They want me to give 'em some personal stuff
They tellin' me I'ma beast and I get it poppin'
When I'm just givin' them doctrine
But their inner's lack the personal touch
Deuce ..
What's your mom given name
Your birth date, birth place, nickname's to the side
How did you come to know Christ
How did you come to the right
Jesus Who's rockin' that white
Who's got His name on His thigh
Well I'm irked by the earth
Not knowing Jesus' worth
They call me William at birth
Tyrone got plugged in the middle
Birth place was Alaska
Yeah you heard me Alaska
Birth date now I have to say you buggin' a little
I was elected for sure at four
There was a call I was ..
As my father spit the gospel of Christ
By grace through faith alone
I met the right Jesus
P.S. anathema
If I don't get the gospel just right

[Verse 3]
People wanna know about you the real you
They want you to share a purse that's common
They want significance and they won't admit this but
Certain hurts kept comin' when they got that
Job, that guy, that girl, that house, that car, that jewel, that money
They're without that God that's ..
But that's another rhyme and it's for another time
Here's the part where I talk to those I might not see
If I only had one thing to say that would make a kid's day
Or change his way, here's what it would be
You should know me by now
Simply with sympathy and empathy I'd say
Kid you're in need of the cross
Cause this is gettin' lost in a day
Where they throwin' the cross away
That's why I feel the need to be the dead horse
