[Intro: Tasha Catour]
Gunnin', gunnin', gunnin'
Everybody want something for their nothing

[Hook: Tasha Catour]
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
These folks is killin' for less money than they can borrow
Create annual sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim flushin' out his anger
Colorin' cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And a daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he will counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is gettin' older, streets is makin' him colder
But his momma's out cold, 'cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister fifteen, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonald's selling poison, got people workin' for cheap and
The military, drugs, or prison the only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in

[Hook: Tasha Catour]
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
This world's cold like no clothes and snow blowin'
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of strippin', she need hope up in my words, mayne
She pull up to the mall and she valet her lil' Mercedes
Wishin' she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's acceptin' her plight, she's the lady of the night
And she saw him in the park with his daughter, they holdin' hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance
It's a cold world, real cold world
Jermaine called that thing, man, where is we gon' turn?
A lot of people thinkin' I'm on an hopeless endeavor, nah
I know Someone who can change the weather forever, ever

[Hook: Tasha Catour]
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
We live in a cold, cold world
