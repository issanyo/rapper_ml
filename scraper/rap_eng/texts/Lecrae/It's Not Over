Know that you got problems
Feels like you're living on borrowed time
You think that you can solve them
You can still get heaven on the line
I'ma light a candle
Show you you can handle
Anything that takes your breath away
So don't you be nervous
We are still in service
By your head, it might be time to pray

(Can't stop now)
No runnin' away
You got some living to do
(Can't stop now)
It's never too late
You got to prove it
It's not over, over
It's not over, over
(It's not over)
It's not over, over
(It's not over)
It's not over, over
(Over)

Searching for a miracle
See it if you open up your eyes
Rushing like a waterfall
Cleanses you and bathes you in your life
I'ma light a candle
Show you you can handle
Anything that takes your breath away
So don't you be nervous
We are still in service
By your head, it might be time to pray

(Can't stop now)
No runnin' away
You got some living to do
(Can't stop now)
It's never too late
You got prove it to you
It's not over, over
It's not over, over
(You're not alone)
It's not over, over
(Over)
It's not over, over

Yeah, I know what they told you
But hold on, ya, it ain't over
Your heart's hard tryin' to back it down
But you done come too far to start backing now and
You probably got a whole lot of questions
But sometimes not knowing is a blessing
So hold on, pray hard
The sun rise with a new great start

The world is yours, don't be afraid
Just lift your heart and walk this way
Believe me, there will come a day
But not today, no, not today

(Can't stop now)
No runnin' away
You got some living to do
(Can't stop now)
Never too late
You got to prove it
It's not over, over
It's not over, over
(It's not over)
It's not over, over
It's not over, over

Over
Over, over, over, over, over
Over
Over, over, over, over, over
Over
