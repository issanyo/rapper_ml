[Hook: Json]
Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes with the fame
But I am not just a artist

[Verse 1: Json]
Shout out to all the artists
If there's a truth to us
Hello to all the bloggers
How you doing reviewers?
You should know that we're human
And this voice that you listen
Is a husband and father
A brother, a Christian
The stage I've been given
It ain't gold cause it glitter
Know what it's like when people judge
Like they know you from Twitter
Or even Facebook
"J's a snake and a lie
He's just a fake
I hit him up
He ain't never reply"
I, I've been gone but not on vacation
And I get home, the wife here's got the baby waiting
My son he got a game
I've been booked for a show
This is our bread and butter
That means I gotta go
No, and I ain't asking for sympathy
I'm just asking for grace and prayer
Remember me
I'm some of what you hear
Portions of what you see
I know I'm a artist
But overall I'm me

[Hook: J-son]
Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes
With the fame
I'm not just an artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
We, we are not just what you
Hear on a CD
I am just me, I'm a human

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
You ain't really real no more
You don't be making music people really feel no more
You used to preach a whole sermon in your songs
Now you sounding kinda watered down
Man what's going on?
Homie I done matured
I have so many issues at heart
Thought that screaming it through
My art made me better, set me apart
If I never get to make another Rebel, it's cool
That was a season in my life, let it settle
And I'm in a new season
Growing as a man
I done been around the world
And started my own fam
I've see a lot of pain
I done been through it
Learned their characters more than
The things you know and what you do
Who you calling Illuminati?
Not me, got me?
Confused with someone who not me
And if my songs don't define me
Interviews are a piece
So you don't really know me
When you see me in the streets
I'm just human

[Hook: J-Son]
Yes, I'm a artist
But I'm not just music
A voice on a record
Homie I'm a human
So let me let you in
Let you see the strain and the hurt
And the pain, yes it comes
With the fame
I'm not just an artist
No, I'm not just music
A voice on a record
We, we are not just what you
Hear on a CD
I am just me, I'm a human

[Verse 3: J-son]
My ears stay to the streets
I hear and I listen
But it's good
We all entitled to our own opinions (true)
I embrace your critique
And I'm open to challenge
Let there be grace and truth so I can receive it with balance
I ain't angry or mad
Know the purpose for real
Is that you see me as a person
I hurt and I feel
You hit me up
I wish I could chop it and build with ya
If I'm honest with my life
This is not a real picture
So if we come off cocky or arrogant even, forgive us
We're falling people
Still growing in Jesus
The difference is when they like you and think you rhyme tight
When you fall they throw us all in lime light
