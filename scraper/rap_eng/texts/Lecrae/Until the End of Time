[Intro]
Time is the fourth dimension
And a measure in which events can ordered
From the past, through the present, into the future
All signify that we are all bound to time

[Hook: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
I be on this here until you bury me
Buildin' His empire that never die
I bet He'll be here till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

[Verse 1: Derek Minor]
Grindin', workin', hustlin' on this mission, I will never quit
Every single track you put in front of me I'm killin' it
Not for money, fame, attention, this is what I'm gettin at
Christ the King and this His empire, He don't deserve no less than that
I'm a be snappin' on tracks you should know if you get in my way that I never let up
There's some people that need to hear truth they get beat down by lies and get told that they'll never get up
Few of 'em might even pull out their strap and go yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak with the gun
I'm a tell 'em that God He want all of your pain
And I'm prayin that one day you feel all of his love
That's all I know, straight live by that
And I'm 'bout that life, I die by that
Believe what I say, we are not goin' away, this is the work of the Lord
Grindin' for all of my days, ain't no more play, this what He makin' me for, I'm gone

[Hook: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
I be on this here until you bury me
Buildin' His empire that never die
I bet He'll be here till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Still wearin' church clothes, loafin' in my pennies boy
Talkin' out they neck about me, lookin' silly boy
Hallowed be Thy name, bless all these shallow souls
I'm focused on forever, don't know what tomorrow holds
Wanna go to war with God? You ain't gon' make it
Makin' them arrogant statements, talk about money you makin'
We know you fakin', we know your whole reputation
And if the shoe fits you better tie your shoe laces
He is so patient with these rebel nations, embracin' they hatred
I would've burned the whole world for insubordination
Yeah, but until the end of time
His grace is sweeter than wine, your god ain't greater than mine, boy

[Hook: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
I be on this here until you bury me
Buildin' His empire that never die
I bet He'll be here till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time
That's forever, ever ever, ever ever
Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

[Verse 3: Canon]
Ok, forever bruh, that's a long time, and gettin' in this game, that's a long line
But I cut through with my Kung Fu, go Jackie Chan on my first rhyme
Cuz I kicks it, Bruce Lee cousin, if I'm on the track that must mean somethin'
Them sixteens that go click bang, when that subwoofer start mean muggin'
My team jumpin', been about that life, look at here, you ain't close to the top height
Lookin' for the proof, they should come up with a name of 'em lookin' like they coming for the kill on the mic
Yikes, sniper tracks in tongue of these artists, such a pro I'm cunning these hoarders
I'm havin' 'em thinkin' they ill, till' the cab that I put 'em on, vocal I'm just gettin' started
We go zero to a hundred in that lane, comin' and runnin' and gunnin' what I gain
I pop pop, I'm a semi-automatic, AK-47, coming to cut 'em with them lyrics
Been cliqued up, my clique get busted, yeah they shook harder They fallin' like a pi√±ata, like super-sweet
I'm exposin' 'em, lookin' inside of 'em, show 'em that nothin' gon' last but the truth in me
Now friend and enemy done dropped to their knees, hail to the Son of God, he drop drop to the King
King, nothing impossible,  look at that Paul the apostle that carried the dream
Dream like Martin the King, make head to the man of the legend, who he?
God is the Alpha Omega, Beginning and End, and the Lamb and the Shepherd of Sheep

[Outro: Derek Minor]
I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be
Till the end of time
I be on this here until you bury me
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
