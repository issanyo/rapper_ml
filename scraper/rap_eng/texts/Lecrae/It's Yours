INTRO
Yeah, 2 Timothy
When I think about the book, man, I think about legacy
And our legacy as Christians is the truth of God
God has entrusted us with His truth
Wants us to pass it down from generation to generation
And that's what Paul was doing to young Timothy
Expected Timothy to continue the movement
Passin the truth of God down

VERSE 1
My time on earth is short, I know I've seen my final days
I thank the Lord above and for you every night I pray
I remember your tears - you bring me plenty joy
Your faith was real ever since you was a younger boy
So keep the movement going - you gotta stand firm
Don't be ashamed of the truth, and let your flame burn
They got me locked down, but we'll never stop now
Not now - look at all this truth that was brought down
And you've been taught now - you gotta pass it on
Invest your life into others so this'll last long
I'll be livin' through you, you'll be livin' through them
They'll continue to do what you taught til the end
And everything I taught to you, teach to faithful men
And make sure they're faithful, otherwise they won't teach again
And everything I taught to you, teach to faithful men
And make sure that they're faithful, otherwise they may not teach again

CHORUS
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you
The time is yours, it's yours

VERSE 2
You're a soldier - follow your orders to fight
Don't get caught up in wordly ways, you're on a mission for Christ
Be an athlete - that means you're runnin' to win
You gotta train and follow rules to finish well at the end
And like a farmer, know the soils of man's souls
So when you're sowin' their hearts, you know what seeds to sow
And like a workman, you're not ashamed of your life
'Cuz you rightly divided truth before you reigned with the Christ
And like a bondslave, you have no will of your own
Just follow the will of God until you kneel at the throne
These are the last days for men, the lovers of pleasure
They don't seek God's treasure and they change with the weather
But you know my life, you know my faith
You walked in my shoes, you looked in my face
Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, too
I was beaten down 'cuz this is the truth, this is the truth

CHORUS
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you
The time is yours, it's yours

VERSE 3
These are my last words, this is my last phrase
These are my last thoughts, these are my last days
My life's invested in you, just as Jesus did for me
And through you, I live also - continue on with this legacy
Your prayer for me - carry out the evidence of this love
And let the truth you learned in youth that you're convinced
Yes sir - God inspired these words to teach you (teach you)
So you'll know the truth and it could reach you (reach you)
Then it reproves you and it beats you
Corrects you and straightens you up just where it needs to
Then it instructs you, it disciplines and trains you
In righteousness, so you're equipped to be who God has made you
And what I gave you is more than my words
It's my life transferred since the day we conferred
So preach the Word, in and out of season - the reason
Is Jesus - believe that I seen Him, they need Him

CHORUS
Now, I've been runnin' this race for some time
Now I hand it off to you 'cuz it's the end of my life
I'm prayin' that, oh, wherever you roam
Know you'll never walk alone, oh no
Keep your faith in the Word of the Lord
Teachin' men to worship Christ is what we live for
Then give it back like I'm givin' to you
The time is yours, it's yours

It's yours...
