[Intro]
Spazz
Yea
I make this spazz
G-g-g-good Work Charlie, hahahaha
Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz
I make this spazz
Spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz, spazz

[Verse 1]
I make this spazz on 'em, knowing that they don’t know me
I may call up homies, 40 deep that's how we rollin'
We pull up on your block and we ain’t got no Glock 40's
No Nina millimeter, hope you never have to meet her
Put a quarter in the meter, this one right here’s a heater
Tryin’ to get off in my zone, watch me hit these wide receivers
If you ain’t a believer, I’m looking for conversion
My 16 is a sermon, get you hands up in this service
I know to bring that realness, so hard I got to kill this
They’re selling me, I’m sick, I already know I’ve got that illness
That 808 up heavy, my adrenaline got me sweaty
I don’t think these people ready, I’ma spazz if they let me
And someone come and get me, cause if they get me started
I’m Leo DiCaprio, I’m gone, departed
This ain't for the faint of heart, it may be for the heartless
The way I eat this beat, you'd think I was a starving artist

[Chorus]
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz

[Verse 2]
Boy, it’s hard to hold this back, it’s hard to keep this in
This spazzing feel so right, not to do it is a sin
Nah, I ain’t got to be wildin' and I ain’t got to be jumpin’
But you feel them walls humming, that's my people coming
Now they ain’t smoking that good, ain't finna do nothing bad
But they on that Jesus juice so they probably gonna spazz
Hollin' 116, see it tatted on they wrist
Cause they ain’t ashamed of nothing mane they get it how they live
The old us is dead, the new us so legit
Got us spazzin' in the game, cause we know we about to win
And then I never said I was hot, but if fires in my bones
Got me sweatin’ in the winter, got me hotter than a stove
They probably think I done lost it, they probably thinkin' I'm gone
But truth be told I done found it, I'm Gucci, I'm gold
I’m better than I ever been that truth that hit me settled in
I’m spazzin' on these people they don’t want it, but they getting it!

[Chorus]
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz
Spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz, (out) spazz, spazz
I might just spazz

[Outro]
I might just spazz
I-I-I might just spazz
