[Chorus]
There He goes, a hero, the savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love, He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world

[Verse 1: Kareem Manuel]
You turn on the news, it's evil in every way
It's like we're waiting on Superman to save the day
That's why when I was youngster I used to pray
That there could be a way God that could walk among us
You see the darkened faces and the hardened hearts
And see Brenda still putting babies up in the dumpster
But when I found out he came was perfect from a babe
Counting equality with God nothing to be attained
He was living to save, forgiving our shame
Though we was deserving to blame, He preferred to give grace
But they still put Him in chains, battered, beaten, and slain
Robes tattered and stained, then he was thrown in the grave
Then he rose in three days
God, it's a good morning
Cuz the son has been raised
And as the tears run down my face and fall to my feet
I heard a man crying out in the street, talking bout you and me

[Chorus]
There He goes, a hero, the savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love, He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world

[Verse 2: Kareem Manuel]
There will be no mourning, there will be no crying
He wipes every tear and stops us all from dying
From every tribe and every nation and every climate
A beautiful tapestry with God as the designer
Until I see His face, amazing grace is my reminder
This is the power of the cross though we're lost he can find us
He's the good shepherd, the Priest, the Cornerstone
The greatest servant and the king sitting on the throne
If I was told I could save every person on the globe
By giving up my son, I'd tell em no
But it pleased the Father to crush Him, He gave himself up
With no discussion, now we all stand blood covered
Redeemed us, He cleaned us, purchased and then freed us
All this work but Lord, you don't need us
You saved me, so I don't want nothing if it's not in You
Your led your Son to the cross, help me follow suit

[Chorus]
There He goes, a hero, the savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love, He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I grew up hearing about Martin, Malcom, and Mandela
I can't tell 'em how they inspired this young fella
But something in their music drew me
I guess that's why they call 'em artists
Thought these people knew me
And I'm hoping for a new me, the present one is dying slow
These artists that I love, I love them cuz they say they dyin too
We dyin to be more than what we are, we chasin
We medicate our pain with fake sensations feeling vacant
Can anybody save us? can someone relieve us?
And in this time of pain I call upon the name of Jesus
He answered with his bleeding, his torture, his beatin'
He said 'I love you so much that I'd die to give you freedom'
From then on I believed Him, I thought I didn't need Him
But all my other idols couldn't save me from my evil
A heathen, a zero, the worst of any people
Was rescued by the Lord of all
Jesus, my Hero

[Chorus]
There He goes, a hero, the savior to the world
Here He stands with scars in His hands
With love, He gave His life so we could be free
The Savior of the world
