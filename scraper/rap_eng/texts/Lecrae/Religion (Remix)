[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Now um, the rules I tend to bend do not define me
So either get beside me, or Satan get behind me
You love to point out all the wrongs, right?
That's a day job, that's a long night
But it's your life
Whats the point that I'm missing?
Tell me the point of your mission
Now I don't know why
You so cold, I
Saw you roll by, with your rouge eyes
You looked right through me and my whole life
But it's all good though
God still love me like I'm kinfolk
I don't break but I might bend though
Forgive my sins, Lord

[Verse 2: PJ Morton]
I don't think I like your religion
Don't always make the best decisions
Not sayin' you don't have good intentions
I know that you are only human

[Chorus: PJ Morton]
But you blame your God when it's your own fault
Where is the love that your God spoke of?
Your God has nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it

[Verse 3: PJ Morton]
That's what you were told, let's just be honest
You didn't even take the time to find it yourself
You just took their words to be true
You don't even know why you believe what you do

[Chorus: PJ Morton]
But you blame your God when it's all your fault
Where is the love that your God spoke of?
Your God has nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it

[Outro: PJ Morton]
Your God has nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Your God has nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Your God has nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it
