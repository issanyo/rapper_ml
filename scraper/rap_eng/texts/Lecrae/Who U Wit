[Intro]
KAA, haha, you know
Yeah, choose this day whom you gon' serve

[Verse 1]
Oh, yes
You know I'm still on a mission, man
I'm still gon' be spittin' 'til I spill my intentions
And youâ€”got saved and was reppin'
Then you strayed from the message, now you stay half-steppin'
Boy, it's real
Yeah, people still dyin', still cryin' on the inside, Satan still lyin'
Still tryna show the world how cool you is
Ain't got a clue about whose you is
Get wit' the program, let 'em know, man
It's willing to fear, it's never been a show, man
It ain't about hot beats and a flow, man
But when you go, tell me where you gon' go, man?
Is it the world or Christ? The girls and ice?
Five minutes of fame or eternal life?
Who u wit? Choose correctly
Think: "Who protects me?
When I reject Him, who accepts me?"

[Hook]
Who u wit?
Are you in it to win, man?
Are you livin' in sin or are you livin' through Him, man?
Who u wit?
Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all
Who u wit?
What you need in life, the world can't give it to you
What you need is Christ
Who u wit?
If you know who you serve, and you roll with the Word, if ya soul sincere

[Verse 2]
A lot of people live for the moment, they want it, they gotta flaunt it, they worship the money and the fast life
You hear 'em on the radio and see 'em on TV in the sleazy scenes and then they wanna thank Christ
Man, I'm hollerin', "Bump back!"
I seen it in my backyard
Dudes act hard, but I know they really lack God
Man, dump that!
They don't know that God is holy
He oppose the proud, but exalt the lowly
That's why I'm rollin' wit' Him, my soul is wit' him
My treasure's are up in Heaven, yeah, my gold is wit' Him
Go wit' God or just don't go
You either watered down or you just don't know
And I'ma say this straight so you do, man, it's true what they say
Ain't no maps to Heaven, there's only one way
You heard it all of your life, the Word is right
If you ain't servin' Christ, then turn tonight
Come on

[Hook]
Who u wit?
Are you in it to win, man?
Are you livin' in sin or are you livin' through Him, man?
Who u wit?
Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all
Who u wit?
What you need in life, the world can't give it to you
What you need is Christ
Who u wit?
If you know who you serve, and you roll with the Word, if ya soul sincere

[Verse 3]
I used to be the dude talkin' 'bout, "Only God can judge me
You can't tell me nothin', man, Jesus love me"
But here I go again with the same ol' sin
The same ol' friends, comin' to the same ol' end
It's like cheatin' on a test that you know you can't pass
Still got to face the teacher's wrath after class
No point in doin' it, you're ruinin your life
Tryna live it for the world 'stead of livin' it for Christ
I promise there's no extra love
For bein' bigger than Fifty, Diddy, and Biggie in the Heavens above
If you read like a Berean, then act it out
Be Heaven's biggest promoter, try to pack it out
You could win you a crown and be down with the team
And know that the bloodstream of Elohim redeems
It's Jesus, I don't say nothing else y'all
You ain't down with Him, you ain't down at all
Come on


[Hook]
Who u wit?
Are you in it to win, man?
Are you livin' in sin or are you livin' through Him, man?
Who u wit?
Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all
Who u wit?
What you need in life, the world can't give it to you
What you need is Christ
Who u wit?
If you know who you serve, and you roll with the Word, if ya soul sincere

[Outro]
Who u wit?
Are you in it to win, man?
Are you livin' in sin or are you livin' through Him, man?
Who u wit?
Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all
Who u wit?
What you need in life, the world can't give it to you
What you need is Christ
Who u wit?
If you know who you serve, and you roll with the Word, if ya soul sincere
