Oh, hands up high
E.C., Lecrae

[Lecrae:]
I confess S.O.S I need ya daily
I can't lie see the pain don't phase me
My God who gon' help these babies

[Chorus:] Lord I need your help

[Lecrae:]
My, my, my

[Erica Campbell:]
I been in the fire so long
I can't get burned no mo'
I thought you was puttin' out the flame
But it was rain from the storm
Thoughts all in my head
Makin' me stressed
All day long
They won't let me rest
"S" on my chest
I ain't that strong

[Hook:]
I need a life line right now
911 won't do
My back's against the wall now
I've done all that I can do
I prayed every prayer
Went to every service
Like I know how
Just a ship without a sail
I'm lost without your help

[Chorus:]
Help
Help
Lord I need Your help

[Erica Campbell:]
Said I do but to tell the truth
Sometimes I don't
But it ain't about my will
It's all about what you want
Your family used to be first
Things getting worse
In my home
My brother is hurt
We need a word
It's too far gone

[Hook:]
I need a life line right now
911 won't do
My back's against the wall now
Done all that I could do
I prayed every prayer
Went to every service
Like I know how
Just a ship without a sail
I'm lost without your help

[Chorus:]
Lord it's me this time
Said I'm cryin' all day
I just can't make it if I don't have your (help)
Whoa said I really need

[Lecrae:]
Dear Lord I need a little help now see
I feel left out
I can't tell my right from my left now
My mama's cryin' cause my daddy's dyin'
He got pains all in his chest now
My daughter's having these nightmares
I might be wrong but I'm right here
I'm tryin' a hold on but my hands hurt
Or the ropes out cause when life fights it don't fight fair
So I'm leaning all on these ropes now
I got hope but it's slow now
So I'm leaning all on these quotes now
Like never leave me
Won't forsake me
If you don't help me
I don't make it

[Erica Campbell:]
Said you'd never leave me
So come on Jesus
Lord yeah
Lord yeah
Does anybody need the Lord?
I can't make it without you Lord, oh
Somebody laying in the hospital now
Need you to make it alright
God I just lost my daddy
I need
Yes I need
Oh, yes I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah
