[Intro: Tedashii]
Man, I consider my life nothing
If I could just finish the race and complete the job the
Lord Jesus gave me
I live to tell the world His message
Romans 1:16
I'm not ashamed!
I ain't ashamed!


[Hook]
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy

[Verse 1]
1-1-6, a band of misfits who get sick at the—
State of the world, so we hit strips and spit Christ Jesus
Who scooped us out of the dirt and cleaned us
We were slaves to sinful ways but Christ freed us, believe us
Because of the Bible that supersedes us
Not to the intellectual thesis
They say we believe in a fool's faith 'cause kids can grasp it
And salvation is granted, to those who ask it
But even if you don't know systematic theology or eschatology
You know Jesus is who you ought to seek
We ought to be — sowing seeds and teaching Truth
Discipling groups of young soldiers and reaping fruit
Aw yeah!
This a part of our lifestyle
Might sound good on wax but we livin' it right now
I wish you would catch me on tapes and CDs
But never see me in the streets in 3D, B, please
We ain't come here to appease
We came to spit these spiritual soliloquies
While killers squeeze triggers and hammers clap
I'ma strap on my bullet Truth vest, and hammer back like that

[Hook]
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy

[Verse 2]
Man, I do this for the Way, the Truth, the Life—Jesus Christ
Until my soul take flight
The world's the same
Everybody want to cop a chain
Cop a dame, cop 22's on the range
Want to cop big fortune and fame
And they claimin' that—they the reason that the cops get trained
Stop the game
I came here to drop a name
Jesus
The same One that blocked the pain
How many thugs you know hard enough to stop the flames?
It's like—standing on the tracks tryna block a train
You got the game
Messed up, stop and change
Mind trapped, all wrapped up in locks and chains
The same God you pray to before you sleep at night
The same God you direspect when you creep at night
Seek the light
Ain't no tryna plead for life
Talkin' 'bout, "I'm sorry, God."
He like, "Leave my sight!"
The key to life is none other than Jesus Christ
If you a slave to your ways be free tonight

[Hook]
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy

[Verse 3]
I spit these bars
Not to get no chicks and cars
Not for spinners on the wheels of expensive cars
Man, I do this for the folk who like to lift they arms
Prays to God who gave His life so He can give us ours
Man, I do this for the blocks in the hood
The Rock's in the hood
Jesus Christ, Cornestone
Gettin' props in the hood
Folks think we crazed and delerious
Cliqued up 40 deep, all saved, all serious (yeah)
And if you curious, we got some proof, man
We—got some answers, we got some Truth, man
Telling folks you know that God is watching you, man
Romans 10:9 is all you got to do, man

[Hook]
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
We souled out (souled out)
Seeking God's face 'til we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't tryna hold out (hold out)
Break me, shape me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy

[Outro]
We souled out
We souled out
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
We souled out
