[Intro]
Bling Cross

[Hook]
Bit-bit-bit, and she sliding in my corns
She with me, cause you boring
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
BET my favourite show
Cause my E's in my glow
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
Bit-bit-bit, and she sliding in my corns
She with me, cause you boring
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
BET my favourite show
Cause my E's in my glow
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins

[Verse]
Got a problem, yo, then say some, I was ready to play some, aye
I don't play 'round some, aye, but I just found some, aye
Look at these bands in my pocket, diamonds dripping like a faucet
Soon as the water hopping, I ain't worried 'bout no coffin
Look at the ice all on me-I got price all on me
Boy, I talk, when my heater started heating on me
I love God, in the name of Jesus, hey
I give my heart to them, eating Reese's, hey (skrt-skrt)
I got dance moves and my mama a pastor
Soon she will see me as a gospel rapper, woo
Blowing paper wind so tough, what's that? Good stuff
Yeah, my food got cooked and people gather me
Shut your little hate that stuff won't bother me
I ain't no weak old person, I'm a strong gospel rapper
Look at my mama singing of the Lord, and she's a pastor
Aye, that ain't enough
Look at me rapping faster
My diamonds dripping like I'm a master
In my old things, gold things, bold things
Fold things, wanna fold in some twinks, aye, aye
I get my cold things, cause I saw that wink
Now that's enough

[Hook]
Bit-bit-bit, and she sliding in my corns
She with me, cause you boring
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
BET my favourite show
Cause my E's in my glow
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
Bit-bit-bit, and she sliding in my corns
She with me, cause you boring
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
BET my favourite show
Cause my E's in my glow
Now I'm real gon' pray with my coins
