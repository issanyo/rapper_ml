[Intro: Lecrae]
Uno uno seis, boy
You know we don’t play, boy
Uno uno seis, boy
You know we don’t play, boy
Uno uno seis, boy
You know we don’t play, boy
Uno uno seis, boy
You know we don’t play, boy
(One one six, we stay true and they)

[Bridge: Alex Medina]
This for my vatos in Cali
Dominicanos up in NY
Cubanos in Miami
Colombianos, we worldwide

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
I rep that Wash Heights like all day, this unashamed life cost me
I try to walk that narrow path, but your boy live off of Broadway
I took the A-train to 1-6-8, Dominicanos playing dominoes
And them platanos all on my plate, New York in my mind state
But you know we take it international, We finna to follow anywhere the master goes
So we hang with and bang with every language even though we speaking that Spanglish like
Dimelo loco, tato let's go, vamonos we out here, oh
Mi amigos y yo venimos from the West Side to the East Coast, so
Ain't nobody repping like this, what
Unashamed the name of my clique, yup
Todos los dias, hermanito, dale ya tu sabe

[Hook: Derek Minor & Andy Mineo]
Uno Uno Seis
When I, Uno Uno Seis aha

Uno Uno Seis up town (one one six, we stay true and they)
When I, Uno Uno Seis up town (one one six, we stay true and they)
When I, Uno Uno Seis up town (one one six, we stay true and they)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I’m on my uno (uno), uno (uno), seis
You know my crew bro
Unashamed since '02 bro, before the 116 tattoos bro
Now you don’t really know if you got time like that
To hear the truth and fellas never mind like that
But we ain't ashamed of but then again spit it how we live it so we get it on a grind like that
From Tejas and that’s Texas, ATL’s where I'm resting
Said I might catch a plane to rep for my King, Puerto Rico’s on my checklist
Boricuas, Cubanos, perdonen mi español
Aqui con mis hermanos, to give Jesus to these VATOS
I pop up-no heater, all about the blood and body-flesh eater
Used to be the Walking Dead but that season ended, now partner I'm a believer

[Hook: Derek Minor & Skrip]
Uno Uno Seis
When I, Uno Uno Seis
When I, Uno Uno Seis
Please don’t get up in my way
What's up Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
What's up When I, Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
What's up When I, Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
Please don’t get up in my way

When I, Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
When I, Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
Please don’t get up in my way (one one six, we stay true and they)

[Verse 3: Skrip]
(Spanish Verse)[?]
Uno uno seis
Turn up, it's in the blood
That name that shows the love
That heals us from up above
We say the name that makes them flee
The demons fell, like up a tree
He breakin' chains
He showed us things
[?] evidence of the King who reigns
(It's Jesus)
Wylin like renegades, but we ain't gonna stop though
If you got that afterlife switch on and hit that top flow
Got that power, but not Austin, baby, so behave
Unashamed livin' before I risen
Uno uno seis

[Hook: Derek Minor & Andy Mineo]
Uno Uno Seis
When I, Uno Uno Seis aha
When I, Uno Uno Seis
Please don’t get up in my way
Uno Uno Seis yeah (one one six, we stay true and they)
When I, Uno Uno Seis aha (one one six, we stay true and they)
When I, Uno Uno Seis (one one six, we stay true and they)
Please don’t get up in my way

[Outro: Andy Mineo]
We've got about three seconds
To turn up
All the way up (we stay true and they)
All the way up (we stay true and they)
All the way up (we stay true and they)
A-a-all the way up  (we stay true and they)
Three, two, one go
All the way up
All the way up
Go ahead and turn all the way up
A-a-all the way up
All the way up
Go ahead and turn all the way up
A-a-all the way up
All the way up
Up, up, up
All the way up
All the way up
Go ahead and turn all the way up
