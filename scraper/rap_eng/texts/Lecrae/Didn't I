[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Look, didn't I settle down with one and get faithful?
When I had options, your boy had a plate full
Didn't I go on TV and wear Grateful
Instead of that Gucci, Ray gotta get paid too
Didn't I talk about my faith in God when it was unpopular
Everybody was hating
Chance went and did it, now it's so innovative
And y'all tryna tell me I'm changing? Pshh, sick
To throw a touchdown, you gotta throw a few interceptions
And nobody perfect, oh, but you the exception, huh?

[Chorus: Darondo & Lecrae]
Didn't I give ya everything?
Didn't I
Didn't I give ya everything?
Didn't I
I tried my best just to be a man?
Didn't I
I really didn't wanna do this, ya' know?
I tried my best just to be a man?
But, Wordsplayed was in the studio, and he told me I had to
Didn't I

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Didn't I, hit the road, never took a dime
Made beats for your albums
Ghostwriting on your rhymes, unh
Didn't I scream 116?
Unashamed in my faith, taking worldwide trips?
Didn't I win the Grammys, talk about my God?
Left it all on the line while they call me fraud
Didn't I stay quiet? Didn't I play shy?
Well, he bashed me in public, you'd think I played Shai?
Didn't I, sit and watch, I ain't no cop
When they stole from me for the nice things they copped
See your friends at the party, I ain't blow yo' spot
When they ask about you, I tell 'em "you doing aiiight"
Didn't I go home to wife and kids
When the IG models in my DMs slid?
Didn't I wake up every day and handle my biz?
Why they tryna crucify me for all of my sins?
To throw a touchdown, you gotta throw a few interceptions
And nobody's perfect, oh, but you the exception?

[Chorus: Darondo]
Didn't I give ya everything?
Didn't I
Didn't I give ya everything?
Didn't I
I tried my best just to be a man?
Didn't I
I tried my best just to be a man?
Didn't I

[Outro: Wordsplayed]
That's right
That's right boys and girls
You're all Kool-aid men
You saw the track, you said "Oh yeaaah"
You all won the lottery, congratulations
If everybody got a dollar, who's rich?
I got bills
No money, mo problems
Nah, keep it running, I'ma keep it going
I got a lot of steam in here, I wanna let off
You got a wrinkled shirt? Put me by it
I got a lot of steam
"Sell out"
You guys throw that word around like a beach-ball at a music festival
I told you when you all looked at us like we were the guys on the bicycles doing the hand signals no one cares about
I'm wylin'!
Hahaha holy smokes
