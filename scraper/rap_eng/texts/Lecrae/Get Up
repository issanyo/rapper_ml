[Verse 1]
Get up, get up, let me put you on
This thing’s about to blow
Can't stop, won't stop
Lettin’ everybody know
That it gets hard, yeah, I know that
But nothing's impossible
You can’t slow down, don’t sit back
Just stand up, you’re unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Why you wasting your life away
So many things you can try today
Nobody holding you back, He's already given the right of way
Got the dreams in your head but you scared, will I crash, will I fall, will I fail
Voices in my head, nah, I don't want to hear that
Tell the devil get back, I will never fear that

[Pre-Chorus]
The whole world's waiting on you
Take your chance, it's time to make a move
Time to make a move

[Chorus]
Get up
Work, work
Get up

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Get up, get up!
Let me put you on, before the light come and the night get gone
This ain’t no cinematic
Ain’t no movie really happenin’
Ain’t nobody yellin’, “Action!”
No cameras and no actin’
It’s real life truth we packin’
Our God is great – no magic
Father made plans and the Son came did that
Born of a virgin and died under Pilate
Pilot, He don’t need one but He still fly
Rose and did a reverse sky dive
No lie, no lie, boy, He comin’ back
I hope you on His team before the sky crack
I’m headed to the party where the lights at
Holla at me, I can be your sky capt

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
Get up
Work
We ain’t playin’, we ain’t playin, no
Work
Get up

[Bridge]
We got one shot so we doin’ it
Then it's lights out
Ain't playin’ games, still unashamed
Not backing down
So get with the program, you already know
The only one holding you back is you
So get up and go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
