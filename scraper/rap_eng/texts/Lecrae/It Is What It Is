[Hook]
I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out
But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is, it is what it is
I’m handlin' biz, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is

[Verse 1]
Some like, “I ain’t really feelin' that bruh
I ain’t with religious rap, bruh”
Some sayin' it is devil rap
Illuminati-on-another-level rap
Fell flat from heaven went to hell and back, huh?
A lot of radio ain’t givin' no play, but it’s ok
Cause my day one's been A-1
Before the co-signs and the pros came
Where you been, been boy, boy?
You ain’t been keepin' up
Church Clothes 1 and 2, then Anomaly
You probably need to turn your speakers up
And now I’m on my third tape
And I just might drop it on a Thursday
So tell the industry and my enemy
That your man wouldn’t follow in they rules in the first place
Thirty plus in the residential
In the truck feelin’ presidential
With my girl lookin’ detrimental
Killin' anything tryna to be a side piece out my mental
Outta your mind
You thinkin’ I’m leavin’ my baby by marchin’ for dimes?
You'll get that curve, you way out of line
Gave her that rock, I’m stayin’ with mine
I keep the huddle mad tight, too many players I don’t trust now
You wasn’t with me on the 4th down, huh?
Then you can miss me when I touchdown
And that’s no shade, no shade
It’s just those games, I don’t play
I’m gettin’ wiser with more age
And realizin’ some gonna hate
And that’s ok

[Hook]
I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out
But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is, it is what it is
I’m handlin' biz, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is

[Verse 2]
Hold up
Let me get a minute from the flexin’
Foreign cars and the million dollar jets
Futuristic clothes, feelin’ like a Jetson
Cause keep it trill, it ain’t really that impressive
Blessed, but I ain’t frontin’ with the Grammys or the fame
I’m just stuntin’ with my family unashamed
And cats say, Crae, you done got it all
In the gym workin' hard, you should show it off!
Nah, that ain’t never been my forte
Pride come before the fall, what the Word say
And I’ve been eatin’ off the wordplay
Working hard on the lyrics that the world play
Remember where I came from in the first place
It’s all a gift, every breath is a birthday
So I spend time tryna find all of these souls lost
Cause it’s a wasted time if I got it all and they souls lost
I ain’t tryna to ball
If that’s what you feel then your goals off
It’s a different game tryna get this truth
Put you on and then go off
So, yeah, I may swag at award shows
Get some jet lag from a tour show
Keep a couple abs on my torso
But none of that is gon' matter when the horn blow
I ain’t tryna front for them flashin’ lights
Man they had us, life is a gift
So if last night was my last night, them I’m good
It is what it is

[Hook]
I’m hearin’ screams and they sayin’ we sold out
But I’m hearin’ screams from the stands cause we souled out, it’s so loud
I got one life so I spend time tryna live 'til the next one
If you don’t like it, cool
It is what it is, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
My plate too full to sample that dish
It is what it is, it is what it is
I’m handlin' biz, it is what it is
It is what it is, it is what it is
