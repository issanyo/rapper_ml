[Intro: Lecrae]
When I grew up, folks would click on sight
Quick to fight
Blood thought he was Superman, Met a crip tonite
We watched when dirty cops rolled through and abused power Them yellow rocks got sold, and our souls we lost ours

[Chorus: Reconcile]
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke

[Verse 1: Reconcile]
Slave master, sleep rappers
Still slaves, that's a different matter
Cops killing, all this drug dealing
All these shells flying, it done hit the ceiling
Same problems happen every day, I just caught this on the iPhone
All this war in America, South Florida, this is my home
The justice system failed us
Education system failed us
All these black men in prison, that's indictment on the system
That's indictment on the system!
Sell a nickel rock catch a sentence
Miss your child support catch a sentence
Don't pay them tickets, you gon' catch a sentence
How you kill someone and get acquitted, dang!

[Chorus: Reconcile]
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke

[Verse 2: Reconcile]
Murder, lyin', all these children dyin'
All these mother’s cryin', all these bullets flyin'
All these dry convictions, all this no snitchin'
All these summer killings, all these dirty politicians
(Gat, gat, gat, gat, gat, gat, gat!)
Choppers and Uzi’s
One life to live (Live)
Use it!
Shawty they plottin' against ya
You blinded by broads and riches
You blinded by all that designer
Gucci, Prada, Ferragamo
They hollerin' black lives don’t matter
And they don’t ride down these streets
And they ain’t givin' no jobs
Pipeline to the penitentiary
A tweet don’t mean you woke
Post don't mean you woke
Get out here and be a mentor
Put your phone down and raise your kid
Be accountable, keep us accountable
Change how we see each other
You got the power to end the hate (hate)
You got the power to kill the root
You got the power to make a change

[Chorus: Reconcile]
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke
Woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke, woke
