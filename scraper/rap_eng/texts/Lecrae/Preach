[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Preach, preach
Don't have a church, but I reach
I heal the blind with a speech
They hit the beach for a piece
I brought my peace to the beach
God's Son, God's Son, God's Son
They want that healing, I got some
They want the realness it cost somethin'
Costly cost me plenty bands
They try to block me
Told me stop talking that blackness or we’ll kick you out the party, gnarly
Pardon me pardon me pardon me
I found myself hit the lottery
No need to make an apology
Can't take that credit, its God in me
I broke the chains on the ship
I broke the chain of command
He broke the chains of my sin
Then put that chain on my neck
My lady told me I’m kinda fly
My daddy, he told me he gotta fly
Momma still call me her little guy
Grandma told me to go testify, preach

[Chorus]
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Y’all know Crae gon preach
Y’all know Zay on beats
Y’all know they gon beast
Y’all press play repeat
Eastside, east side, east side
I used to stay on the east side
Zay used to play on the east side
Gucci 'Nem came from the east side
I got that light
I got that glow
Look at me shine
That’s how you know
I don’t need diamonds or jewelry
Your VVS’s are blurry
Been through too much to be scary
I'd rather pray you could worry
I got the Lord with me
Walk through the valley of death
Predators on every side
I’m in war with the flesh
They want to feast on my flesh
This is not merely a test
They try to put me to rest
I let ''em deal with the mess

[Chorus]
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
Preacher Preach, I got the Jesus piece
I got the God in me, don't need the ice or the chain
I got the Lord with me, don’t need to front on the game, preach
