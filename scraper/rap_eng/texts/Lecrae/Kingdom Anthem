Yeah, you know who it is
Ya did it again boy

[Derek Minor]
Uno uno seis
When I uno uno seis
When I uno uno seis
Please don't get up in my way
When I uno uno uno uno uno uno uno uno u-u-u-u

[Andy Mineo]
3 2 1 Go

[Hook: Chris Lee Cobbins
(I represent for my Saviour) (x3)
I represent for my Saviour
I hold it down for my squad
I'd be reppin', rappin' for the kingdom
Till they all know who you are

[Verse 1: Princeton Marcellis]
G-g-gotta let it out
I can't keep quiet
That good stuff, that living water
That bread of life for when we're dyin'
You stood me up in 06 (You stood me up in 06)
I was living life so hopeless (I was living life so hopeless)
No focus, no aim, and your glory was a notice, Lord
I wanna do Your will (I wanna do Your will)
You say "now be still
Not every scar shows and that all wounds heal"
Sometimes we can't see all the pain one feels
And I can't see You God but I still know You real

[Princeton Marcellis, (Tedashii) & Andy Mineo]
(Turn up boy, turn up boy, turn up boy, turn up (x2)
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t)
I can't see You God but I still know You real
Go

[Hook]

[Outro: Princeton Marcellis]
(You stood me up in 06, I was living so hopeless, no)
(I wanna do Your will)
