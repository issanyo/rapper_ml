[Lecrae:]
Well um, the rules I tend to bend do not define me
So either get beside me, or satan get behind me
You love to point out all the wrongs right?
That's a day job, that's a long night
But it's your life what's the point that I'm missing?
Tell me the point of your mission
Now I don't know why you so cold
I saw you go by witcho rolled eyes
You looked right through me and my whole life
But it's all good though, God still love me like I'm kinfolk
I might break but I won't bend though
Forgive my sins Lord

[PJ: Verse 1]
I don't think I like your religion
Don't always make the best decisions yeah, yeah
Not saying you don't have good intentions
I know that you are only human yeah

[Chorus]
But you blame your god
It's your own fault
Where is the love that your God spoke of?
Your God had nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it yeah
Nothing to do with it
Nothing to do with it

[Verse 2:]
That's what you were told let's just be honest
Oooh nah nah
You didn't even take the time to find it yourself
You just took their words to be true ooh yeah
You don't even know why you believe what you do ooh

[Chorus]
But you blame your God
It's your own fault
Where is the love, ooh, that your God spoke of?
Your God had nothing to do with it, yeah oh
Nothing to do with it, yeah oh
Nothing to do with it uh
Nothing to do with it
Your God had nothing to do with it yeah, yeah, yeah
Nothing to do with it, yeah

[PJ Speaking:]
Thank Y'all
So on this album I did something that I never did before
I uh, did a cover song and a lot of my heroes did cover songs
So I always wanted to put a cover song on my album but I just
Never did
And uh, so I picked one of my favorites of all time
And I could always hear the soul in this song
But I said let me take it a step further and really put the soul
All the way in it
Uh it's by the BeeGees
And imma have my friend Yebba come and help me
Sing this one
Yeah here we go
