[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Uh, she want me to leave her alone
But I swear I have get her gone
In God we trust, man
Keeping my head into a lust, man
That my answer is true
And I don't wanna be with her
I already got a wife, but she said she don't care
That's why she don't trust in God
Money throwing that's all we got

[Chrous: Evan DMmix]
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!

[Verse 2: Evan DMmix]
Yo, fake dudes don't know how to trust
I'm not trying to fuss
Industrial love, that's how im all that stuff
I'm lost inside my freakin' mind
Please, make it go away
I love God, and what's wrong with that?
I am all rhyming and stuff, this is for gospel rap
Will have to go dance like that

[Chrous: Evan DMmix]
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
Uh oh, blessings!
