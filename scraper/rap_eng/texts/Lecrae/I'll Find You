[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm hangin' on by a thread
And all I'm clinging to is prayers
And every breath is like a battle
I feel like I ain't come prepared
And death's knockin' on the front door
Pain's creepin' through the back
Fear's crawlin' through the windows
Waiting for 'em to attack
They say "Don't get bitter, get better"
I'm workin' on switchin' them letters
But tell God I'ma need a whole lotta hope keeping it together
I'm smilin' in everyone's face
I'm cryin' whenever they leave the room
They don't know the battle I face
They don't understand what I'm going through

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trusting in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
They say fear haunts
And pain hates
I say pain strengthens
And fear drives faith
And I don't know all of the outcomes
Don't know what happens tomorrow
But when that ocean of doubt comes
Don't let me drown in my sorrow
And don't let me stay at the bottom
I feel like this hole is too deep to climb
I've been lookin' for a way out
But I'll settle for a peace of mind
Picking up the pieces of my life and hopin' that I'll put together something right
Tell me all I got is all I need
Tell me you gon' help me stay and fight

[Pre-Chorus: Lecrae]
The world tryna play with my soul
I'm just tryna find where to go
I'm tryna remember the way
I'm tryna get back to my home
But I can't do this on my own
That's why I'm just trusting in You
'Cause I don't know where else to go
And I don't know what else to do

[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
No don't let the fear make you feel like you can't fight this on your own
You know I â€“ I'll be there for you no matter where you go
You'll never be alone, no

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
Just fight a little longer, my friend
It's all worth it in the end
But when you got nobody to turn to
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
I'll find you
I'll find you
Just hold on and I'll find you
