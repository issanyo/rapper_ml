[Intro: Waka Flocka Flame]
Waka
Lecrae, Flocka Flame, Lecrae, Flocka Flame
Ayy man be careful who you listen and where you get your game from lil' homie
Some folks will send you up the road just send you up the river with no guidance you know what I mean?
They only gon give you one side of the game they ain’t  gon tell you everything

[Chorus: K-So]
You get rich off of dope if you let them tell it
Get a scale and a boat, weigh it up and sell it
They got rich off of kush if you let them tell it (flex!)
But it's two sides to the game and they ain't gon tell it
They gon' make it seem like that lil' money worth your freedom (On God)
They'll have you sitting in the box with family you can't see 'em
'Cause they ain't tell you 'bout informants and indictments
They just make it look enticing showing big racks and diamonds

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Ayy, What up to soup and them, J in the Lou and them
Nene and J in the D, I used to fool with them
My uncle was moving the D
With the Pirus and 'em
Me, I just wanted to be him
Then I could cop me a BM
Told me the right way to pitch it
Told me beware of the snitches

Thought he had figured it out
But I was there when he got sentenced
Left the babies with the BM he don't ever get to see em
Kalif Browder for a season
I’m writing letters tryna free em
CO’s was breaking 'em down
Roaches and rats on the ground
Potnas ain’t nowhere around
But yet he the man in the town
Dope man dope man dope man
Do sell don't tell don’t tell
Never hug his kids again but prosecutors don't care

[Chorus: K-So & (Waka Flocka Flame)]
You get rich off of dope if you let them tell it (Flocka!)
Get a scale and a boat, weigh it up and sell it (bow, bow)
They got rich off of kush if you let them tell it (swerve)
But it's two sides to the game and they ain't gon tell it
They gon' make it seem like that lil' money worth your freedom (On God)
They'll have you sitting in the box with family you can't see 'em (You Know)
'Cause they ain't tell you 'bout informants and indictments  (Bow Bow Bow Bow)
They just make it look enticing showing big racks and diamonds

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
What up with Digs and 'em?
What up with Tang and 'em?
Had all the chains on 'em
And then they got chains on 'em
Had potnas they swore they were real
A Lot of em changed on them
And don't act the same with them
Ain't droppin' change on them
You in the yard with some killers
He in the house with the fam
He took the block and just ran
That's just part of the game
Best friend hugging your dame
He throwin' dirt on your name
He put the word in the hood
That you took the stand like a lame
A thousand eight grams get you 32 bands
Or 32 years with some cell mate fans
Ballin back home and you can't find your mans
Now you in the cell prayin' that his gun jam

[Chorus: K-So & (Waka Flocka Flame)]
You get rich off of dope if you let them tell it (Flocka!)
Get a scale and a boat, weigh it up and sell it (bow, bow)
They got rich off of kush if you let them tell it (swerve)
But it's two sides to the game and they ain't gon tell it
They gon' make it seem like that lil' money worth your freedom (On God)
They'll have you sitting in the box with family you can't see 'em (You Know)
'Cause they ain't tell you 'bout informants and indictments  (Bow Bow Bow Bow)
They just make it look enticing showing big racks and diamonds
