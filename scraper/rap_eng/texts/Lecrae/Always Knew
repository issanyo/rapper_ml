[Intro]
Yeah, this right here is dedicated to my family, my friends, my lady, everybody that helped me down through the highs and lows. Especially the Lord, you know what I mean? You held a bright light in my life, you feel me?

Shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
Yeah, ayy
Shine a light on me

[Verse 1]
Learned a lot over these last few years
Industry people ain't friends, just peers
I learned that these girls easy like the morning of a Sunday
They don't love you 'til you gone like Harambe
Still killin' over colors, now it's black and blue
We dyin' every day, B, we just don't make the news
When you speak out for your race, just watch
They gon' twist and say you hate these cops
I'ma take these shots
How can he love Jesus, Kanye, and K-Dot?
Martin, Malcolm, and Schaeffer, Mitsubishi, and Maybach?
Contradictory, nah, it's complimentary
Understanding me ain't for the simple and elementary, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I know this might go over some heads
But I come from being government fed
Could be running from feds
But now I give the government bread
'Cause you playin' back the words that I said

[Chorus]
I can't believe we made it through
My momma said she ain't surprised, told me that she always knew
My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew
I told my lady, "I ain't never met nobody like you"
I thank you

[Verse 2]
Now I remember, uh, I was sittin' in my room
Glued to my television daily after school
And I never saw me goin' to college
Higher learning was a different world, I can acknowledge
I used to imagine me in a black Range
Gettin' paid from doin' this lil' rap thing
And now I'm payin' these professors couple thousand for a lesson
Graduated, in recession, Sallie Mae just wanna check in, I'm stressin'
Rap music, it was all a dream
Now I'm in a session chasin' my dream
Who would have knew? Man, it's crazy
S1 introduced me to JAY-Z
Never met my dad, but I met the music that raised me

[Pre-Chorus]
I know this might go over some heads
But I come from being government fed
Could be running from feds
But now I give the government bread
'Cause you playin' back the words that I said
That's crazy

[Chorus]
I can't believe we made it through
My momma said she ain't surprised, told me that she always knew
My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew
I told my lady, "I ain't never met nobody like you"
I thank you

[Verse 3]
Listen, I know God did it, can't take the credit
Paid off all of my debts, but I still feel so indebted
Been all over the world with these songs I wrote
My life story oughta to give y'all hope
Without a doubt I've been doubted and counted out
I've been down for the count, about to quit
Momma told me keep going 'cause I was made for this
I either get a scholarship or I could get a hit
I still can't believe I made it here

[Chorus]
I can't believe we made it through
My momma said she ain't surprised, told me that she always knew
My day ones still the same ones, love to the crew
I told my lady, "I ain't never met nobody like you"
I thank you

[Outro]
Shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
Yeah, ayy
Shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
You shine a light on me
Yeah, man
