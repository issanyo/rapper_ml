Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
They say them boy's riding clean
But without the King, what does it really mean
Cup full of lean, got a sweet for the green
Wake up, boy this ain't a dream
Welcome to H-Town

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Fell in love with a harsh road at my auntie house
Dipping with my kin folks, them spoke, okay I
Candy paint, sexy as we tipping from the city lights
Got them boys flexing, baby, every time we pimp the ride
Gripping wood grain, always sipping good, man
I was down for whatever, wished somebody would mayne
Enticing with them vices, yeah mayne, looking pretty like a bad yellow bone
While I'm dipping through the city. Th-Th-Throwed in the game it's going down, I'm yelling mayday!
It's like the world stood still when we bought them gray tapes
Ch-chop chopped screwed, outchea act a fool
It's got me wondering what's next, baby, when this life is through

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I was born in H-Town, starched down way back
When the slabs in the city beat that screw off in the back
Poking eye, keep them spinners, eating Frenchy's chicken dinner
Family came from 3rd Ward Scott Street on up to Ennis
Hanging out on Sunnyside with my cousin Corel
They was on that purple Sprite, I was still sipping 40s
Keke's still pimping stories as I'm passing by Yates next
Stop and wonder if I'll enter heaven's gates
I told my cousin D at TSU "I smoke trees
I think the Lord is calling me, both of us agree"
And, man, I love the city of my birth, that's why I plea
That God will change the H the same way He's changing me!
Cause all I cared about was riding clean
A pocket full of green, and find a bad yellow
I can put up on my team
My bros riding dirty, know your soul ain't clean
And gon' let the Lord intervene!

[Bridge]
Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
I'm praying for H-Town, yeah yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa, yeah

[Verse 3: Dre Murray]
I had a dream on the plane that I was sitting in the slabs
Seat back, bass up, chunking deuce and giving dap
Talking to my partners 'bout these plans that I have
When I told them "Oklahoma" made them boys just laugh, like
"Where there at, folk? " "man, stop the joking" "yeah, you hood, but you ain't dat dope"
It's like they couldn't understand me having that hope, trying to serve God
They want me serving things with that dope, but that's when we flat broke
Pass the kill. And as I got higher, death is what I started to feel "dog, we smokin' kill"
I backed away from the killer, He picked up my life and my vision got clearer
Destiny is screamin' it's faint, but I hear that things are bad right now
But the man in the mirror is trying to make a change, rearrange some things
H-Town, I still love you, hold up, man

[Sample]
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Now what y'all know about them Texas boys
