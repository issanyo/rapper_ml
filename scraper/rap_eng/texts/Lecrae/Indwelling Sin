[Sin]
Aye look what's good fam it's me again
The one you used to call your friend
I know you ain't forgot me?

[Lecrae]
Oh yeah, you always get me caught in sin

[Sin]
Here you go with that again
You act like we ain't cool or something
Lets go smoke a Kool or something
Talk and sip a brew or something

[Lecrae]
Nah man I ain't trusting you
Ain't nothing but lust in you
Thanks be to God I obeyed the teaching I was entrusted to
Cause when you pass by you just want your boy to backslide
Have me feeling sick like I'm coming down off a crack high

[Sin]
Man that's a flat lie
You act like I'm the bad guy
You know when me and you get together we have a grand time
Lets take it back, all the way to like the 6th grade
Last thing on your mind back in the day was trying to live saved
Remember house parties, kissing in the dark?
Man that was innocent fun come on-

[Lecrae]
Now don't start
See dog I live by the Spirit so I don't gratify
All them old sinful desires that never satsify

[Sin]
Aye come on kill that
Look me in my face and tell me I'm a lie
You ain't feeling chasing women, getting drunk, and getting high
Stacking money, staying fly, living up the playas life
We was having fun now you gon' try to be religious

[Lecrae]
Ayo man first of all lower your voice
Who you talkin' to?
Handcuffed in August '02 I got caught with you
Truck flipped over on 35 that was all from you
I'll mess around and lose my life, man tryna walk in you
I'm standing on these stages and got these people believing me
What I look like trying to gratify this disease in me

[Sin]
So now I'm a disease? Man please, I got yo back dog
I ain't saying drop the Jesus and be a rap star
All Im saying is when it's you and me lets be real folk
We ain't gotta be selling drugs and tryna kill folk
Maybe just a lil-

[Lecrae]
What? A lil this, a lil that
A lil BET late at night, that's like a lil crack
See you ain't gone lie to me, I see how you be tryna be
BET tonight becomes addiction to pornography
That's in no way honoring the God who's ruling sovereignly

[Sin]
Man you know you miss them old days

[Lecrae]
Yeah you right possibly
But after that I sober up, think of Jesus holding up
His skin up on the cross for all them drunken nights I'm throwing up
Every thought of blowin' up is captured in his flowing blood
I start thinking Philippians 4:8 when you showing up

[Sin]
You know I ain't gon' quit right?

[Lecrae]
Yeah I know but I'm dead to you
And one day I'll be present with Jesus who died and bled from you
Colossians 1:15 thats the God that I trust in
The Father crushed Him, in doing so he has crushed sin
