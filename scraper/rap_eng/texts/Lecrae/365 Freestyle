Hey man, I'm back like I never left
I got my mind fixated on finding freedom, I ain't thinking about missing a step
A rap prodigy, still an Anomaly
Frequently frequent and pass times when I was tryna be
All that I am and but never thought I could
Go I went, never thought I would
I would be called a G, would see my momma's good son, my father's bastard
Fighting to flee devil's disaster, here and hereafter
And I ain't tryna be nobody's pastor
But I'll pro'lly be they favorite rapper
I'm just keeping it real, the saints love me 'cause I say what they feel
The sinners love me 'cause I'm helping 'em heal
You can see the appeal
But Lord knows I'm a sinner too
I'm tryna run my race and finish too
So you can lend me your ears
And let me tell you how this nappy headed kid did it big
Tryna help the world live, man it's all God
