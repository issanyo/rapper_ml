[Verse 1: Lalah Hathaway]
The universe told me
I could have whatever I want
Let me make a smart suggestion
You should go and have a talk
But, the world that you live in
The air that you're breathing will carry you
And, whatever you're hope of and dream of
Know you can see it through
This I know

[Chorus: Lalah Hathaway]
So, don't give up
This is the time to make it right
Things always get better
Don't give up
So, hold your head up to the sky
Things always get better
So, don't give up
Things always get better
Never give up
Things always get better
It takes time to see

[Verse 2: Lalah Hathaway]
If I believe what they told me
I'd quit a 100 times by now
One thing led to another
The weight of life had me turn around
Because the world that I live in
The air that we're breathing will carry you
And, I know because I've been there before
Rest assured you can make it through
This I know

[Chorus: Lalah Hathaway]
So, don't give up
This is the time to make it right
Things always get better
Don't give up
So, hold your head up to the sky
Things always get better
So, don't give up
Things always get better
Never give up
Things always get better
It takes time to see

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Now, don't you ever give up
Don't you ever look down
This is just a new season, gon' and plant the seed in that ground
And, you needed space to reach the stars
You been planted
You don't realize your soil
You just take that ground for granted
But, you going through where so many there before you
While plenty may ignore you
It's many that adore you
Hopefully, this restore you
For you, I pray often
Keep that dream alive like you Martin

[Chorus: Lalah Hathaway]
So, don't give up
This is the time to make it right
Things always get better
Don't give up
So, hold your head up to the sky
Things always get better
So, don't give up
Things always get better
Never give up
Things always get better
It takes time to see
