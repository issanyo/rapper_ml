[Intro: Lecrae]
Let's go

[Verse 1: Britt Nicole]
I tried to cover my shine
I've tried staying in the lines
I, I, I don't wanna hide
No not tonight
You, you, you want me to take my light
Fit it in your box right
I want you to look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye

[Hook: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not
Here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, oh ready or not here, here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
I'ma take it all over the world
To the young to the old every boy and girl
Ready or not here I come
I'ma show the world where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Ready or not, ready or not
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Ready or not

[Verse 2: Britt Nicole]
I'm not ever selling out love
A love out loud is what it's all about
Giving everything to see the lost get found
Yeah, it's going down
You, you, you want me to take my light
Fit it in your box right
I want you to look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye

[Hook: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not
Here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, oh ready or not here, here I come
This is who I am
I won't hide it
I'ma take it all over the world
To the young to the old every boy and girl
Ready or not here I come
I'ma show the world where the love is

[Verse 3: Lecrae & Britt Nicole]
I refuse to keep this buried deep inside of me
Yeah this little light of mine, it's time to let it shine a bit
Cause there's no point in hiding it
It's everything I am
The source of all my hope
And it's the reason why I stand
And I pledge allegiance to be somebody real
There's no more holding it back
I'm showing them how I feel cuz love is more than a word
It's a noun, and a verb, and hiding it is absurd
Ya heard

[Hook: Britt Nicole]
Ready or not
Here, here, here I come
I'm about to show you where the light comes from
Oh, oh, oh ready or not here, here I come (this is who I am)
This is who I am
I won't hide it (I'm not gonna hide it)
I'ma take it all over the world
To the young to the old every boy and girl
Ready or not here I come (here I come)
I'ma show the world where the love is
Ready or not
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
Ready or not, ready or not
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
I'ma show you where the love is
Ready or not
Where the love is
Where the love is
Where the love is
I'ma show you where the love is
Ready or not, not, not, not
Ready or not
