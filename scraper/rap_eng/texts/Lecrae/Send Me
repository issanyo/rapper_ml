[Chorus]
Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Lemme go lemme go!
(repeat x4)

[Verse 1]
I seen it with my own two
There's no way I can show you
A perfectly poverty stricken people with no view
And I bet you can't believe this
They never heard of Jesus
Heard of Young Buck, Lil' Wayne, and Young Jeezy
No one's signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch X-zibit pimpin' a Hummer
While a nine year old is shot down
No one's screaming 'stop now!'
No bridge illustrations for criminals who on lock down
People deep in Africa
Looking for an answer bruh'
In China man
They're dying man
Until they know who died for sins
So look what grace did
Not for us to stay hid
Inside our comfort zones
At home in mama's basement
Get out on the grind y'all
Ain't no better time dawg
I know y'all read the Great Commission
Let me just remind y'all:
Make disciples of the nations
Teach 'em to obey the Lord
Hate to never lead someone to Christ before? Raise the sword!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hey! After 1,000 years in the West and the church is
Get'n bigger daily
Without understand'n worship. (say what?)
Some regenerated but a lot ain't saved
You walk outside and be surprised cus the block ain't changed
And the numbers they be get'n me
Something just ain't hit'n them
America ain't Christian they just practice'n the ritual
That's why we should be missional
Hey, what you think I'm spit'n for?
United States is dyin'
And the East is looking pitiful
Some places if they catch you
They'll arrest you and
They'll serve you
But they still need the Word too
The Gospel should be heard too
We claim we ain't ashamed
But we still ain't hit the block up
We in our Christian bubble
While our brotha's get'n locked up
Lord I wanna stock up
Pack a bag and walk up
In a country where sharin' my
Faith may get me shot up
Anywhere I go, whether my city, Lord, or far abroad
I just wanna show' em Jesus Christ the risen, holy God

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know they're dyin' in the streets over in the Middle East
Some kids seekin' peace
Others hold'n up a piece
If the violence doesn't cease
Then at least the deceased
Might know Jesus as their Savior as their bodies hit the streets
And I know this is a graphic view
I pray that it's attack'n you
Attractin' you to act and do
What you see in the back illusion
Matthew twenty-four and fourteen
We should read it twice
Before we think that life is just a battle
See we free in Christ!
Look dawg! Life is more than church work and football!
What if you were dead and seen that Christians overlooked y'all!
This is why we leave the couch
And leave the comforts of our house
To show a dyin' world a God they'll probably never read about

[Outro]
The great commission says make disciples of all nations
Have we even made them in our own nation?
Come on Christians!
Missions exist because worship doesn't
People don't worship the god that made them
We're ambassadors
Let's go!

[Chorus]
