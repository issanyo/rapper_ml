[Intro: Tasha Catour]
For better or for worse
Make it work
I ain’t goin nowhere

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah, I messed up, but you hurt me
Blew it like it’s yo’ birthday
And you love it baby on Wednesday
But I make you sick on Thursday
And I know I'm wrong and you shutin’ down
And I touch down like “What now?”
Why we going through all this?
Why things gotta be rough now?
But, you had so many break-ups, you can't believe
You go and break my heart that I forgive and I ain't leave
Don't define you by your faults
Ain't gon’ push your buttons either
Everyday we startin’ fresh, this is how it's s’posed to be
Never try to take advantage, you respect me as a man
But every once ‘a while you get to popping off and
Say stuff you shouldn't be sayin’
But I'm witchu, I ain't playin’, if it's thick or if it's thin
Both the times and your figure, girl, this is who I am
I love you baby, that's real talk
And this life we live is a real walk
I ain't goin’ nowhere
Tell your girlfriends that it's still on
I love you baby, that’s real talk
This life we live is a real walk
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, tell your friends that it’s on

[Hook: Tasha Catour]
For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I be makin’ you mad, girl
But you said you'll never leave me lonely
So I had to put a ring up on it
‘cause our commitment ain't no game
Yeah we laugh, but we ain't playin’
I’mma always be yo’ mane
And I know sometimes I upset you
Be pushin’ all o’ you buttons
We be fussin’, fighting over nothin’
You can try to leave, but I’m comin’
We gon’ work it out with no runnin’
Pushin’ ,shovin’
I know sometimes that I'm selfish
But I jump in front of yo’ bullet
Cause you everything that prayed fo’
Plus a little bit extra
Even when you getchu an attitude and you act a little bit extra
Listen, you make better, babe
You make better, babe
You got my heart and you can have it for forever, baby
And though we’ll never break up
I hate it when we mad
But love it when we get to make up
No lines that I could make up
To let you know how much I got you covered, girl
And I only be pushin’ yo’ buttons because I love you, girl

[Hook]
For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)

[Bridge]
We can go through fire, but it won't
Make us leave each other, no
Coz this love is stronger even though
You push my buttons boy

[Hook]
For better or for worse
Sometimes I make you sick
And you get on my nerves
Make it work
I ain’t goin’ nowhere, and I give you my word
I will be right here
So though you push my buttons (I ain’t leavin’)
You can keep on pushin’ (I ain’t leavin’)
My buttons
My buttons
