I seen it with my own two
There's no way I can show you
A perfectly poverty stricken people with no view
And i bet you can't believe this
They never heard of Jesus
Heard of young buck, lil wayne, and young jeezy

No one's signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch Xzibit pimping a hummer

While a nine year old is shot down
No one's screaming 'stop now!'
No bridge illustrations for criminals who on lock down

People deep in Africa
Looking for an answer bra'
In china man
They're dying man
Until they know who died for sins
So look what grace did
Not for us to stay hid

Inside our comfort zones
At home in mama's basement

Get out on the grind y'all
Ain't no better time dawg
I know y'all read the great commission
Let me just remind y'all:
Make disciples of the nations
Teach em to obey the Lord
Hate to never lead someone to Christ before I face the Lord

Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Lemme go lemme go!
(repeat x4)

Hey! After, 1,000 years in the west and the church is
Get'n bigger daily without understanding worship. (say what?)

Some regenerated but a lot ain't saved
You walk outside and be surprised cuz the block ain't changed
And the numbers, they be getting em

Something still ain't hit'n them
America ain't christian they just practicing a ritual

That's why we should be missional
Hey, what you think i'm spit'n for?
The united states is dying
And in the east it's looking pitiful


Some places if they catch you
They'll arrest you
They'll serve you
But they still need the word too
The gospel should be heard too
We claim we ain't ashamed
But yet we ain't hit the block up
Were in our christian bubble
While our brotha's get'n locked up
Lord i wanna stock up
Pack a bag and walk up
In a country where sharing my faith may get me shot up
Anywhere i go, whether my city or far abroad
I just wanna show 'em Jesus Christ the risen holy God


Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Lemme go lemme go!
(repeat x4)

Represent! Get crunk!
If you know you reppin' Jesus go ahead and throw it up
