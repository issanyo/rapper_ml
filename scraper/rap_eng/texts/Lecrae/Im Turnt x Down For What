[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Check it
Look at me I'm all the way turnt up
I ain't smoking but my homie in here burnt up
Yeah, I'm working on him, But he straight though
Couple girls trying to twerk it on me, wait- no
No, hold up
Before you even roll up I'm in here with my lady
Can't you see me man? I'm sewed up
Man I'm in here trying to celebrate a birthday
And you know I'm good aware its a work day
No matter, we still gon' kick it
And we ain't getting trippy, no molly in my sippy
Ain't fighting nobody, ain't nobody set tripping
It's Southeast Diego in the building
Shout-out to Peter Pan, Skyline and Pierro
We out here trying to function, holler if you with it though
Prolly think I'm rolling, I'm just high on the spirit bro
The only thing we popping is the truth, you don't hear me though

[Hook: Lecrae]
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
They prolly think I'm rolling, I ain't on nothing
But what I got you need to know about cause homie
