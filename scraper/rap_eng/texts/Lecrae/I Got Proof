If you go through the Bible consistently (that means read it)
Realize there’s no inconsistencies, start looking at things differently
When a soldier in his infantry looks at Genesis 3
God said it was him, the messiah that crushed the head
Of the serpent as I read, saw it all come to a head
Told of the suffering at Judas’ hand
The promise seen through Abraham
Prophecies Isaiah said, all fulfilled through Christ who bled
The Da Vinci code or Zeitgeist film
Couldn’t convince me not to die for him
Without their fame and prominence
Their arguments don’t make no sense
How you gon’ convince me that I’m simply a product of chance?
That the Big Bang came, and made a monkey that done made a man?
If you want to follow theory or die you got...?
Then there’s clearly nothing left to be said
Cus Christ is alive, rose to the sky
While all your truths are surely dead

[Hook]
I got proof, I got proof, I got proof
That he’s still living
I got proof, I got proof, I got proof
That he is risen
And this is why I die, why I live my life
For the sake of Jesus Christ, cus I believe that he’s alive

[Lecrae]
Witness not based on what I witness
But due to the word of an eye witness
But get this I don’t wanna wanna miss this
Business is serious like sickness
Arguments get me weary, man
They don’t use any history
All they have is a theory mayne
Why they tryin’ to Da Vinci me?
I spit a couple flows, did a couple shows
Met a couple bros who was all into doin’ no-nos
That and they into reading pros off of Dead Sea scrolls
Come on bro tell me that don’t sound loco
Cus Jesus died, took our sins into the sky
And a hundred times five seen him in the flesh alive
And the light in Paul’s eyes got him on his knees cryin’
Mention Jesus died tonight, runnin for his very life
They think that’s a lie, but Paul really died
Like millions other Christians who gave their life up for Christ

Hook

They wanna know why I’d die for him
Confused on why I ride with him
Got questions about Christian living
He’ll answer like Iverson
Heard me say Christ in all my songs
Dude run up on me like what if I’m wrong
I said I’m not then I saw his jaw
Stretch out and lay on the floor
He asked me how so I told him more
Christ in the clouds, and people saw him
Witnesses told them their report
Got them killed still they held on
To what they knew was no mistake
Got crucified, burned at the stake
If this wasn’t true, then dude I say
Would you die for what you knew was fake?
So I hope this hitting home, I ain’t reached this on my own
But why I preach him in every song
If he ain’t rise then find his bones
Been looking in the tombs, still looking in the ground
Keep searching bro, no where to be found
I ain’t Sherlock, but homes I’m found
So believe he ain’t no where around
