Lyrics From Snippet:

[Verse]
Uh, I got too much to say but haven't said enough
I called the music business bluff, I ain't famous enough
Huh, who cares if they think I'm saved enough
Grace is sufficient, my blood donor gave enough
And they be tripping when they see a Christian
Like we over religious and trying to bring conviction
They be waking up without a hope of sight
I turned to Christ on my darkest night
I ain't homophobic or anti-semitic
So give me low credit 'fore you give me edits
People see my faith, and the cross as a loss
But I can't see me dying, bein' superstitious, yeah
And I ain't the picture of perfection
I lose my direction, I be cussin' and drinkin'
But I ain't forgot the resurrection
Only source of hope 'fore I made them oppositions

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
Say I will, say I won't
Don't you ever doubt it, ever doubt it
How I live is how I live
Thought you knew
