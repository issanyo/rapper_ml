[Verse 3]
What if life ain't supposed to be gravy
Full of hurt, pain, death, rape, murder and craziness
If God made everything good
Then why you still gotta live in the hood what's really good

Yeah money, power, possessions
Chasing all that stuff, and you're still not getting that
That change inside you lookin for man
Cause it won't satisfy
You need to turn away from all that and turn to the cross of Jesus Christ
He died to pay for all your sin
Jesus
