[Verse 1: Lecrae]
I'm blackin' out
On my last leg
Takin' final breaths
Overheard the Doctor say
I ain't gonna make it
Final steps
In the zone
Half panickin'
Half feelin' gone
"Hang on homie!"
My boys yellin' tryna keep me goin'
Little sister in the distance
I see her tears flowin'
Where mommy at?
She on the ground past out cold
Aw man this is how it ends
Death came quick
My God
I'll do anything just let me live
I wanna pray
But I can't pray, I never really done it
I don't know if I should call Christ
Buddha, or Mohammed
Gettin' blunted earlier this evenin' now seems wrong
And my brain is searchin' hard for any scripture or song
I'm havin' flashbacks
Now I remember, it was December
I was standing on the corner
Pitching rocks in the Winter
Young dude ran up on me, thought he was a winner
But he started tryna convince me all the ways I'm a sinner

[Spoken: Lecrae]
Man, you never understood before man
You've lied before right? Okay right
You've stolen before right?
Well man you've already broken two of the ten commandments, man
That qualifies you as, a lawbreaker
That's, that's sin, man
That offends the holy and perfect and righteous God, man
That's sin, you need a savior because of the sin, man
I'm just tryna break it down for you

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
{gasps} Havin' a hard time breathin'
But I ain't leavin' until I know what I believe in
Wait, maybe it was Ak on the block
Who was tellin' me Mohammed was the rock
Nah, stop!
(You know man, you know Mohammed was the truth. You know what I'm sayin'? Islam is the way to go yo.)
But ain't Mohammed die?
Yeah, dawg and they buried him
That's scary then cause I don't know if Allah really carries men
Let's get back to Jesus {cough}
Coughin' and wheezin'
This worlds full of lies man
Everything's misleadin'
They told me don't be scared to die
But dawg that's ridiculous
Cause I don't know what happens to me next in this predicament
It's sickenin'
God, give me answers
Give me clues
Help me understand
Who do I trust?
What do I do?

[Spoken: Doctor]
Okay we're losin' him, we're losin' him!
He's dying fast
Nurse! Help me!
I need help over here
Hurry up!

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Ah, oh man
I can't breath
I'm dyin'
Can't think
Wait, wait, Mohammed? Buddah?
No, no, no, no, no, no
Jesus, Jesus
Okay, back to Christ
First He lived, then He died
Then that Easter play I saw one time said He came back alive
And God so loved the world...
What's the rest of that verse?
Think fast, can't remember
Help me nurse!
"What's John 3:16, nurse?
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son.."
Gave up His only son
Okay yeah that's right
So whoever believes in Him
Wait? Who turned out the lights?
I'm dyin'! I'm dead!
No my eyes went closed
I can't feel my feet no mo'
And my sides is cold
God, please I'm sorry for all the wrong that I've done
I know I've, been a terrible father and a horrible son
I see it now, I wish that I could change some things
In my life, I really never took the blame for things
Like lyin' and stealin'
And hurtin' and dealin'
I'll quit it all if you're willin'
And let me walk out this buildin'
I wronged You, I see that
I wanna give in
But I ain't really sure if you've forgivin' my sins
Well this is it
No more discussion to do
I don't know much
But I know I should be trustin' in...
