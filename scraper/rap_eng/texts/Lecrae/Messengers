[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers (Can you hear it?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
We've been given a call
Been forgiven, risen, we livin' to give him our all
Rise up from your past it's holding you down
This moment is all that matters the future is now
How will the people know if we don't tell 'em if we fail 'em
They stumblin' in the dark but the light is what we carry
Yeah, don't have to wonder your purpose or what you here for
Reflect His image and show the world what he cares for

[Pre-Hook: Lecrae]
And I know it's alright
And you know it's your life
And we know, we know that time's running out
Can't wait around cause
The time is now

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers
Calling all the messengers (Can you hear it?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, hey

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
I've been a lot of places where the scene ain't pretty
I've seen plenty of hatred, death, and destruction where ignorance kills many
The blind leading the blind we turning a blind eye
That alone is a crime we got the power of life
I know that we make mistakes don't let 'em keep you away
Mercy love and His grace is the reason we move ahead
Speak out though we never been qualified to do it
I ain't earned it, I was loved into it I'm brand new - yea

[Pre-Hook: Lecrae]
And I know it's alright
And you know it's your life
And we know, we know that time's running out
Can't wait around cause
The time is now

[Hook: for KING & COUNTRY]
Calling all the messengers
