[Intro: Lecrae]
Yea, uh
We still crossin' over man
Ye, They still gon hate us cuz they hate him first
And I'm still in the same place dawg

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yeah I'm still in a church
Focused and alert
No suit and tie, still got the t-shirt
I'm into praisin' God because He made us out of dirt
And plus He gave His life for this world's evil works
Now flirt with that
Most of y'all can't jerk with that
Cause it ain't no benefits and no perks with that
Still gotta' live your life on this earth with that
But we live eternally and I can work with that
Holla, yeah I cheated, yeah I lust within
But guess what, that's why I trust in Him
See you thinkin' that you ain't that bad
You just lyin' to yourself playboy you better check your health
While you're all about the cash and ice
Hope you ready for change
You just broke the first commandment twice
And I know that you done stole before
If it wasn't a gun it was some gum from the grocery store
It's all sin to God
Man look into God
You guilty, you ain't even a friend to God
Sin gotta' high price it'll cost your life
But God fit that bill on the cross with Christ

[Hook: Lecrae] (2x)
Crossover, from death to life man
What's the hold up accept the Christ man
We flex the Mic, to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Aye yo
I don't catch the Spirit, I'm all filled up
I can't lose it either, I'm all sealed up
And you can bet yo life, that imma rep for Christ
One taste He'll get you right
Folks is, thinking they Christian
But when they sinnin'
They don't feel the conviction that the, Spirit is givin'
And they, keep livin' life like, "that's cool with me."
Y'all dudes ain't fooling me
Try to play me to the left like I'm trying to get deep on them
This is real talk dawg, you better peep somethin'
This ain't that philosophic rap like â€˜Harmoynm'
And I ain't talking about the God you heard about from mom and them
Put that blunt out dawg, put down the Heineken
"Man God understands" What? Come again
I guess you think that God is kinda' like yo momma huh?
Like He ain't even trippin' on your sinnin and your drama

[Hook: Lecrae] (2x)
Crossover, from death to life man
What's the hold up accept the Christ man
We flex the Mic, to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight

[Verse 3]
Look, life's way more then ice and rims
If you don't make enough to pay the price of sin
And God's gon' judge you dawg
That's reality sayin' you don't believe is like saying there ain't no gravity
Then running off to go jump a cliff
And when you hit the ground tell me what you get
Aye, why you running from the freedom of the Gospel?
You hostile
You're looking like your Lucifer's apostle
But God got you
And though we all deserve death He still keep putting breath in your nostrils
But you treat Him like an obstacle
See Him come at your convenience like a stop and go
Waiting for a sweeter deal or a sign or somethin'
Like God ain't come down and die or somethin'
Trust me dawg God wants the best for you
That's why the Gospel of Christ is addressed to you

[Hook: Lecrae] (2x)
Crossover, from death to life man
What's the hold up accept the Christ man
We flex the Mic, to rep for Christ
So we can put your soul at rest tonight
