[Intro: Don Cannon]
Reach Records is the movement
I want to take this time now to salute the believers
I want to shout out to the non-believers too

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
So let â€˜em know that when I come to the end of my road
And they ask me was it worth it
The hurting, the pain, and the life I chose
I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat
I'll tell 'em I'll do it again in a heartbeat, heartbeat, heart-heart-heartbeat
And I died with no regrets
Died with no regrets
Died-died-die-die-die-die-die-die-die-die

[Verse: Lecrae]
And when it's, and when it's, and when it's over this something else starts
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart
What you trusting in what you lusting in
For that busty momma that's strutting in
And you popping bottles you throwing dollars
That's cool but partner this just in
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Some of us gon' end up holy some of us gon' end up hot
Yea I do believe in heaven but my actions ain't the key
Them gates remain locked if everything follow me

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]

[Skrillex]
Oh, I love (x24)

[Lecrae]
That you gon' live forever whether you want to or not
Only thing that's really gon' matter is that hope inside your heart

[Skrillex]
Oh, I love (x10)
