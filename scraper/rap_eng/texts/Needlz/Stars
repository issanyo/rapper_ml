[Intro: John Regan]
My grandma used to say to me
That opening my eyes was the gift of another day to me
So every time I close them, she would kneel down and pray for me
And hope that when they open, I would somehow find a way to see Stars

[Verse 1: John Regan]

Is this the first day of the rest of my life, or
Was this all that there was to fight for?
I wrote about every sight saw
So I need a reason to write more
My pen, I feel like I should put it down
And quit music, regardless of how good it sounds
Just concentrate on my nine to five
Finally get that promotion
No more begging people to post my
Songs, just to have these so-call-critics expose my wrongs
And ignore my rights
I guess they can't see my vision, they got poor eyesight
Or maybe I do
Either way, I'm proud that I even have a fan to say goodbye to
Most'll never even have that
I was not supposed to even have rap
But I reached for the Stars

[Hook: Nicholas Howard]
Oh the Stars are in me
Still nobody knows my name
What it would be if life were the same
As that day my dreams had prayed for
What it would be

[Verse 2: John Regan]
Is this the first day of the rest of my career?
Or just the last breath that I could spare?
I wrote about every dream
Every minute of my life, every chapter, every scene
Auditioning for the lead, memorized every page
But ended up in the audience, staring at the stage
Wishing it was me
Reciting all those lines, with the audience so captivated
Listening to me
But this audience is full of actors
Well, wannabe actors who can’t act as well
They’re all on stage, the seats all empty
Where’s the hip-hop fans? they’re all emcees
So even if I'm better than the rest
We're all in competition, so who is there to impress?
A crowd full of performers lining up in front of me
Open mic, signing up in front of me
Because they wanna be Stars

[Hook: Nicholas Howard]

[Verse 3: John Regan]
I wanna say I'm sorry to my daughters
For never having my priorities in order
Not understanding all they really need was me
Wishing these ambitions would just leave us be
Wishing I was happy to be average
Instead of stressing what I never had or did
Enjoying every minute that I have to live
And satisfied with giving all I Got to Give
I wanna play double-dutch with my kids
And be proud of that A+ on the fridge
I wanna love my wife
Well, maybe in another life
Will we celebrate another anniversary?
Or would celebrating one be even worse for me?
I wonder, is this my introduction?
Or merely an interruption?

[Hook: Nicholas Howard]
