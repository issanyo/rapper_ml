[Intro]
Hmph
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Well, well, well, a slew overdue, you rue the kiss & tell
Who knew that the blues would fruition to hell?
True crews with a clue to do missions too swell
I tried to explain it, nameless niggas don’t latter
Fathom the brainless, the aimless as well as chatter
Splattered the matter, devoured the sour and
Shattered the adjustments, a flower dumped by a Mexican (Hmph)
Man, man, man, even if it were the swiftest non-existent plans
Believin’ that it’s not as vicious isn’t quick to span
Phases change, blasé blah, ‘Hameha, flipped the van
Name your range, hahaha, yes, I am
Levitatin’, I’m neva’ hatin’, glitch out the jam
And if it’s regulating, I’m neva’ waitin’, bitch out for damn’s
The blade still swings, sings things I never can
Even if this be the last word I utter
Butter’s equal to peaceful, let’s hope it’s mine
Treason is the season, no sequels, leavin’ a broken spine
Retrieving a spoken mind, the reason won’t go defined
Cold as mine?, long pause, close to eternity, duh
Hold his nine, strong claws, mostly concerning me the
Fact that rats boast cheese, so we see piss & smell *Sniff*
Wish ‘em well
The aftermath of all this shit will remain influential
Only a selected few maintain and deserve credentials
Look, most of the time I want the city to shine
Even if there's no grime like I am, that's fine
Distortion and grittiness isn't as mandatory as
Making sure the craft is perfected, and you surpass
Yourself every second, a weapon you will use fast
And if it is expected, respect it, the muse'll last
Reality is always neglected, you'd usually ask
"How come everybody around me is moving fast?"
The tortoise usually wins the race, but in this case
90 MPH, bucking, seal the fate, steal the fucking dinner plate
A winner’s steak, smack down, don’t chew a raw
And what the fuck is back down?, Prone to the flaws
React now, had to crack down, no room for y’all’s bullshit
Catch full clips slip, a doomin’ awe
