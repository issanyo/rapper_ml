[Verse 1: Ryan, Jude, (Brittany)]
He makes me feel so good (good)
That man of mine
Though half of the time he makes me laugh
The other half he's making me (cry, cry, cry)
But every time we make good love
All the bad seems to go away
And I always give him something he can feel
'Cause I got nothing, if I can't make him stay
Oh suga, suga

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan & Jude]
I got the feeling he want
He got the love that I need
I crave and I know that it's wrong
I ask to come back when I leave
And he ain't going nowhere
Wrong or right, I don't care
I just wanna keep him here

[Chorus: Ryan & Jude]
So I give him my
Suga, suga, suga, suga
He don't deserve it but I give him my
Suga, suga, suga, suga
Suga

[Verse 2: Ryan, (Brittany), & Jude]
Understand (stand)
Me and this man of mine (mine)
Sometimes he treats me cold as ice
But then he sets my body so on (fire, fire)
And every time I try to pull away
He kisses me right there in that place
Addicted to his love (love)
I can't get enough ('nough)
I won't give him up (no)
I can handle us 'cause

[Pre-Chorus: Ryan & Jude]
I got the feeling he want
He got the love that I need
I crave and I know that it's wrong
I ask to come back when I leave
And he ain't going nowhere
Wrong or right, I don't care
I just wanna keep him there

[Chorus: Ryan & Jude]
So I give him my
Suga, suga, suga, suga
He don't deserve it but I give him my
Suga, suga, suga, suga
Suga
