[Verse 1: Ryan & Brittany]
Baby, what's up?
What you want, what you need, as for me, I ain't never been afraid of love
No, I ain't never been the type to be shy, I know everything you thinking of
Caitlin:
If you're looking for the one night, that ain't what I like
Ryan:
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, whoa

[Chorus: Sharlene]
You told me you're lookin' for love (lookin' for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it

[Verse 2: Georgia & myomie]
Now we been kinda getting 'long, talkin' on the phone
Last thing before bed, first thing in the morn'
You been dropping 'lil hints, talking real slick
Tryna make me feel like if there was a list
That you'd be on top, number one spot
Well, baby take your time, I got only one heart
Myomie:
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, aye, say!

[Chorus]:
You told me you're lookin' for love (lookin' for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it

[Verse 3: Georgia & myomie]
Baby. Baby, I wanna be the
The one you love to call on
The one you know you're needing
Ryan:
Oh, baby, baby I wanna be the
The one you love to call on
The one you know you needing, oh!

[Bridge: Sharlene, Brittany, Jude & Ryan]:
Sharlene:
Quiero amarte (I wanna love you)
Necesito amarte (I wanna love you)
Voy a amarte por siempre (I'm gonna love you forever baby)
Quiero amarte (I wanna love you)
Necesito amarte
Ryan:
But if you don't stop, then I won't stop
I'll give you everything I got, ooh-oh-oh!

[Chorus: Sharlene & Ryan]:
You told me you're lookin' for love (lookin' for love)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell your secrets, to trust (to trust)
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
You told me you're lookin' for love (you told me you're lookin', babe, you're lookin', babe, you're lookin', babe)
For love
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
Someone to tell you secrets to trust, to trust
So don't look, so don't look no further you got it
