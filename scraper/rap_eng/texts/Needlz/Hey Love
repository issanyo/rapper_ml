[Chorus]
Hey love - I guess it's obvious, I'm digging your style
Hey love - you make it easy for a girl to settle down
And love - it's not enough, so you keep me with a smile
Hey love - you are the one, I'm meant to marry, give a child
My love  - don't ever wonder, yo I'll always be around
I love   - the way you love me or you balance me out
Hey love - you are the everything that I can't live without
Hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love

[Verse 1]
Hey love, you had my heart from the moment we met
So cool and casual, we automatically click
Time spent, talking long on the telephone
Transformed the friendship into something different
Knew it when we first kissed
You were the one I'm meant vibe with
You made me smile at the time, when I felt my life spiraling
The definition of the God's sin
Always genuine and thug and generally up
I gave right and, I felt right then
You fit nice in my mind, waking blinking all the time
Called myself right in rhymes
Your name next to mine with hearts in the middle
Trying to fill that little space
Want to wake up at your place, making breakfast for the day
Making kissing in the rain, let the records play, as we lay
We can focus on tomorrow today
Thinking how can I hold you down
I think and maybe you thinking the same

[Chorus]
Hey love - I guess it's obvious, I'm digging your style
Hey love - you make it easy for a girl to settle down
And love - it's not enough, so you keep me with a smile
Hey love - you are the one, I'm meant to marry, give a child
My love  - don't ever wonder, yo I'll always be around
I love   - the way you love me or you balance me out
Hey love - you are the everything that I can't live without
Hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love

[Verse 2]
Okay, we figured it out
But at the sex and alcohol you got a big mouth
You be talking 'bout my attitude, but look how you sound
It ain't always what you said, but baby how we come out
Yeah, I'm loud and don't missing cause I'm in you washing dishes
That's me sitting in the kitchen for a minute, forgive it
My disposition feels a little different, we both sleeping
My smart commits got you tripping
We tied live and barely speaking
See my number on the other and we leave it blinking
We need to meet and, for both two
Stabbing just to say I love you, I wanted, but I [?]
Because it's all about you and never me, so
I'ma let you see what it feel live to miss me
I pray to God, you miss me, pray to God you listen and love
Hope you're hearing clear I really miss you and yo
I just need you near, baby just come here

[Chorus]
Hey love - I guess it's obvious, I'm digging your style
Hey love - you make it easy for a girl to settle down
And love - it's not enough, so you keep me with a smile
Hey love - you are the one, I'm meant to marry, give a child
My love  - don't ever wonder, yo I'll always be around
I love   - the way you love me or you balance me out
Hey love - you are the everything that I can't live without
Hey love, hey love, hey love, hey love
