Have you ever been in love with a man?
Some days it's all good, some days it's all bad
Sometime he come home just a little too late
I straight up act a fool but I know I'm gon stay
Sometime I call his phone but he don't pick up
But then I get a text, damn I'm back in love
He got me out here like a fool
Man K what's wrong with you?
I know that love ain't fair
And I know he's wrong but I don't care
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay when it gets rough
Cause when it feels good it's just enough
And that's better than nothing
That's better than nothing
Do you hear me?
When I'm all alone I get down and I pray
That he can get it right, so we can make it straight
And that's why I stay, cause I know I wanna ring
So I keep holding on, I'm sticking to this thing
And it just might be another man out there
Who would treat me better but he won't compare
Even when I'm out here like a fool
Ain't nobody do it like he do
I know that love ain't fair
And I know he's wrong but I don't care
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay when it gets rough
Cause when it feels good it's just enough
They say that a woman shouldn't love a man more than he
Loves her
But I can't help it
I didn't choose this
My heart did, yeah
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna be sorry for putting myself
Through the stress
Taking your mess
But I'm still around waiting for your best
Cause a little of something
Is better than nothing
When you need somebody so much
You go through the pain to get to the love
A little of something
Is better than nothing
That's why I stay when it gets rough
Cause when it feels good it's just enough
That's better than nothing
That's better than nothing
