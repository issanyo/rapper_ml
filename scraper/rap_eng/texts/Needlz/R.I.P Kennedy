Lil B

[Hook x2]
I wonder how many chances that I get
To make you realise I exist
I feel invisible
Anyway I always walk around in a bliss
I wonder if I exist

[Verse 2 - Lil B]
All my niggas die while my niggas be dying
Niggas wasn't born gangster, why you out here lying
I wasn't born a gangster, it was just some circumstances
My momma wasn't rich, she was driving AC transit
And it's not so easy when you driving on them buses
You can't go to the bathroom can't go out to lunch
Shout out to Lil Wayne for all the brunches
Shout out to Mack Maine I got you like a blunt
Aye man check it out bitch you know Im saying
Uh some niggas I can't trust
Shit got exposed niggas ran and covered up
I got a lot of and I got based up
I stay swagged up, need a whole place up
I got too many fucking classes I'm above average
I come from nothing nigga my mom was driving AC transit
Shout out to Wolf Pack let's get it nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Lil B]
What can I say for this day
What can I save
What am I able to say
Cause If I talk are you able to stay
Feel out of place like a table that's grey
? skin could change up the day
Whatever that means bitch I'm here for today
I wish for tomorrow with the dark of the nights
I be loving life, life loves you too
People selling drugs its no honor what you do
But would you listen I got 20-20 vision
I got 65 bitches
Teachers that move on leaders
I feel like the four seasons
Cuz I wake up and I gotta go upstairs nigga
The dope upstairs and I clean up
I gotta get that factory zip lockbag bitch I'm cleaning up

[Hook x2]
