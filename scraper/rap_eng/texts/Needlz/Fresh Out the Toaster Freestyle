[Verse 1: Honors English]
Go memorize it perfect
I'm about to merk it
I kill it then resurrect just so I can rehearse it
Go check the album
Download or purchase
Blueprint beats over Stillmatic verses
Now Q telling me the rhymes that I'm telling him
Sick enough to snatch the crown off of Biggie's skeleton
Top ten flowa
Can't say I'm eight or lower
Since the skill is infinite I'm just kicking the eight over
And now the chicks is chasing
I get her with the single
Then I drop her with the album
Now that's release dating
Final four fresh
Full court press
Might have to go through Hov on my way to cut down the nets
Peace God
Sheesh God
I'm ready for beef God
Like I'm at Ground Zero selling Bean-pies
Lyrically I push it
If y'all want it I will pull it
I am good at troubleshooting
Not sure if y'all want the bullets
Fresh out the toaster
Told ya I'd roast ya

[Verse 2: Honors English]
Where I'm from, where I'm from
They run up on you
Three at a time
Like Herman Cain on that grind
For that cane
They will tax you with that nine nine nine
Cages full of conviction
It's two million missing
The land of the free where all you see is double platinum prisons
Radon in the air
Heart attacks in the kitchen
Before I was born
These were the pre-existing conditions
Hey Kony 2012
Meet modern day Trenton
Abortion clinics is giving birth to invisible children
It's the one verse assassin
One verse assassin
Dead the whole language
I'm changing English to Latin
If all you do is trapping and spit about click-clacking
Then Honors English is Sanskrit for
"Nigga, quit rapping"
Ugh, get in the mirror and practice
No matter how you look at it the shit is still backwards
They argue is it timeless
Is a instant classic?
Tell MTV, call me if they ever want rap fixed
Shout out to Dan and all my reporter homies
Yo, when I go off the records yo please still quote me
When I off the record it's dead from the beginning
Throw an electric chair at the end of every sentence
The phenom, virtuoso beyond
Sixteen tracks in one rap these are CD rhymes
I should get my elbow a deal
I could get my knee signed
That's fresh out the toaster
It's over, rewind...
