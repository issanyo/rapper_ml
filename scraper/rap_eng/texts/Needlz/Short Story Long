SHORT STORY LONG (Directors Cut)

[Honors English]

[Scene 1]
Na na na na na na na
He ain't wanna’ kill mo time
At 8:45 he put both hands on the 9
It wartime so he let the hollows fly
Now Its easy to kill
But its hard to watch men die
Now I’m watchin like I’m a private eye
Cuz he ain't on his homies side
He on the side of his home
This here is homicide’
Now the bullets in the air
Like its slow motion
Almost no motion
Before this he was hulk Hogan
Now he’s soft spoken
Mouth stuck as if his jaw broken
Heart feels sawed open
He went from sad to angry to happy to anxious
Now ain't this creating an emotional athlete
His heart racing last lap of the track meet
Cuz he was thinking bout’ marriage this year
The house he could have made he buildin’ castles in the air
He closed his eyes and asked to disappear
Freeze it there yeah!

[Scene II]
Now zoom in hella for this set
Get the beads of sweat pour him
As they pour from the pores in his neck
They clearly yellin ‘duck
They clearly yellin ‘duck
From the right and the left
He can’t hear
Both his ears on a double date with deaf (th)
Definitely its mental uh
Revengeful
He can’t bring himself to pray at his own temples
Now get a good angle on his friend
Who try to act upset but then again
Is just glad it isn’t him
Sinful now zoom out slow and peep the pattern of the crows
All flying together like some traveling skulls
Ohh, he fell into the darkest place
So god never seen him when he called for his grace
Then it hit him like a storm
Don’t worry he was calm
He wasn’t even there
To know that he was gone

[Scene III]
They say if you pick up a shell and listen
That you can hear inside of the ocean
I picked up the shell
I only heard a violent explosion
I still see the 9 and its smoking
And the kids silently dying
His eyelids is open
Look!! Look!! he’s startin’ to shake
It’s a war inside of him
He fall for his fate
Life and death were like doors
They revolved on his face
You could have swore he was asleep
And started falling awake
Caught in between
The callin’ of the ultimate gates
And that corner where he
Scuffled and struggled and hustled
Round’ the way
And as he loses his T cells
His eyes lose detail
He can't tell a guy from a female
Out of one eye he can see heaven
Other eye he can see hell
When he crosses them he sees a sunrise
From when he was 12
And at the crossroads he became a corpse
From far up he looked like Jesus slain on the cross
It all happen so quick
Just 59 ticks
I looked down at my watch
Its 8:46
Damn……
