My uncle produced for poor, righteous teachers
Said out of new school emcees you should be the leader
He did a MC search, said ''damn, he next to shine''
Bet that cash, money, man, he fresh
To get a A+ and say whatâ€™s in the bones of the thugs
Local Run DMC, he gave my uncle a rush
Whenever I spit on the beat, nuts
So any lady with luck would call my phone and request love
So inspired by Lauryn, inspired by Nas
Thought I'd do something with Wyclef that would deserve a prize
My tribe, they called it souls of mischief
Walking on the far side, had the whole city high
With my cousin Rob, wanted to boot camp the clique
Yeah, it's no limit to how many observers
Babies in juveniles would grow up to see murders
Tried to be a kid and play, learn the A to the Z's
But it wasn't nice and smooth, we was warrin' with G's
Girls would call me D-Nice cause I was nice with the D
Shorty you blow me a kiss cause my style is so chic
Plus I got a little fame battling and they had nothing for me
Mac 10 high-tech shit that could kill a army first ave
Before John got discovered with a smith and wesson talk
Impact my little brother cause Big L got hit, and Murda Ma$e quit
I'm thinking to myself, do you need a q-tip?
It's you versus the industry and nobody beats the biz
Unless you do a little flip and change who you is
And tell the children stories, that's only for Slick Rick
Bloods having mad skills, don't get you paid like J.Cole
Only had 50 cent when I saw Curtis blow
Like I can't be broke, it's not in my nature, boy
I wonder when I'm 40, would they thank me later
It'll be a rough ride, the south turned anti-Nas
Might need to break shit, they anti-locks
Went back to school, raps couldn't wu 'em forever
Ton of books I read, man, became a large professor
That's when I realized they arrested the development
Separated dead prayers from getting dead presidents
We turned on CNN, they tried to be the freshest prince
Chased half a mill and went back to special Ed again
We let them kill our nappy roots and black thoughts
How you thinking you a gang star and not a black star?
See, it's all kriss kross, we just ghetto boys fighting lost boys
Over who's more outlaw, are you above the law?
Who's ever life become more 2Pac their life becomes too short
Of course I'm just kicking it game off
If you looking for hip hop, then I'm the main source
