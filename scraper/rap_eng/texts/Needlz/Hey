Hey lil momma

Y'all pirates see me spitting
Lets take over the system
Tonight we free the prisons

Hey lil water

Homey let's get it cracking 4000 soldiers ready we take over Mahattan

Hey young pirates

Ya'll pirates steady wildin'
Y'all ready for the violence?
We ready on the island

Hey homies and bandits

Tonight we just we just keep ridin'
Nassau to Suffolk County
And every cracker
