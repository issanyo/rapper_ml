[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Just get on the floor, you immigrant whore
Who ran to that back room? Don't make me kick in that door
Yo, where your green card cunt? Are you a citizen
Or another Mexican slut looking in the system for more?
Shit, how many other spics you living with?
Don't you understand just setting foot in this land is a privilege?
You taking jobs from some hard working Americans
You being a bitch, you are worse than a terrorist
Stop screaming, you scaring us, it’s embarrassing
We barely understanding it, what part of our life do you think is glamorous?
Working for less than minimum wage with a boss who treat us like cattle
And then the INS coming in to disband all the family
Yeah but you ain't got no rights bitch, don't make me get my nightstick
You don't gotta stay if you don't like it
You don't pay no taxes you wetback bitch and you have kids
At least what you can do is learn the language ‘cause I got a right to stay

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
Just get your hands off, turn this to a stand off
My husband’s in the back, we got a baby boy who can't walk
We crossed and we thought that it would be different
From third world to second class citizen, watching for the minutemen
The ones you say you not American, you less
Couldn’t get a visa but we got American Express
And the cash that we carried in was less
Then they profit off our fears, please tell me who’s the terrorist again?
How many aliens are living in your casa?
I’mma put the pistol to you like you Elian Gonzales
When I send you back to Juarez unless you got some dollars
Then maybe I can help you fix your problems
I’m sorry but the price fixed and baby, I don't think you should turn it down
I can't afford but I am sure that we can work it out
Have you been working out? Your body looking perfect now
You better shut the door and close the curtains now ‘cause I got a right to stay

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
Understand me clear, I don't want my man to hear
I’m only doing this to keep my family here
Yeah but I don’t give a fuck you little bitch
You go and tell that little spic he gonna have to share
You lucky I don’t bring that wagon in, baby, I don't owe you
But as far as I’m concerned, your ass is getting off
Just stop crying or I promise I’mma tip ‘em off
Okay, I’m trying really, I don't wanna piss you off
I’ll do anything you want as long as you don’t ship us off
Just leave my kids alone, don't let them see me like this
Yeah, smile bitch and tell me that you like it, you can call me papi
If you stop me, then I promise you gonna have it rough
If you question my authority, then you can ask the judge
‘Cause I don't have to budge, I have all the power
I’m dirty now, your ass gonna need a shower
But you kept us here for hours, yeah ‘cause I do what I want
Yo, bring the car around and put some cuffs up on these fucks
