[Hook: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
He spent most of his youth with his head down
Chubby, fugly, awkward walk and not much of a talker
He was good at setting bad examples but bad at math
Crunch time, he kept it moving like the lunch line
Working on his salad bars and fruit punch lines
His simple triplets had his english teachers tongue tied
As he starts pirouette for perfection
And Darren Aronofsky Black Swan reflection

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Hook: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Raised in a broken home built brick by government, cheese brick Back and forth between parents, making us sea sick
On his knees every night, praying for a little change
But the tooth fairy was broke and offered little hope
He used to stand in front of mirrors
With his toothbrush star searching
But he ain't have to search far
He was smart and made a pact with himself
With a smirk and made a vow that one day
His dad would never ever have to worry


[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Hook: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Fast forward a few twenty four hours
Little boy turned man, makes good on his promise
Just to say we didn't take the trips to the Bahamas
Now your boy bank account got a few more commas
The hard work payed off, don't it?
Plus it feel good when you can say you own it
No rent, lease, loan or a mortgage
That generator money, no shortage

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, he wasn't sure
He plucked feather from his back
And watched his bottom limbs, bend forward
Toward something more, toward something more

[Hook: Brendon Urie]
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
You gotta keep on keeping on
Even with the feeling that you're gonna keep losing
You gotta come back strong
