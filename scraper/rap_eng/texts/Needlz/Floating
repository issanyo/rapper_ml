[Verse 1:]
Can't nobody say I'm not in love
(No, can't nobody say it)
And can't nobody do me like you does (No, can't nobody)

Nobody comes on my block
And brightens my day
Ain't no dude around my way
That can touch me the way that you do, baby

Ooh ooh baby
Ain't no doubt about it
It's you

[Hook repeat 2x:]
You make me wanna sing, baby
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

[Chorus repeat 4x:]
You got me (floating through the sky)
'Cuz of your love

[Verse 2:]
And other cats be all up in my face
(No, I ain't checkin' for 'em, no, no)
But see, can't nobody take your place (No, can't nobody)

Ain't nobody holding me down
Lke you hold me down
One kiss from your lips
And I leave the ground

It's so true baby
Ooh ooh, baby
Ain't no doubt about it
It's you

[Repeat hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I'm on cloud nine
You keep it thorough
You stay by my side

My sunshine
Baby, forever with you
I'ma ride

My soldier
You hold the key to my heart
Playtime's over
This thing is so very for real

[Repeat hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]
