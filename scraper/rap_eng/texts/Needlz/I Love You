[Verse 1]Tamar Braxton
Baby when you touch me, I feel like ooo
I just wanna follow everything you do
Things you do inside of my mind
I'm a sucker for you every time
I just wanna be around you everyday
Listen to every single word you say
There's a way I feel when you're in my face
I just love when you're in my space

[Chorus]Tamar Braxton
I can't go a day without you
Without you nothing else matters
Boy you seem to make me better
Baby, baby I'm just saying
I love you

[Verse 2]Tamar Braxton
I'm so lucky, I can't believe
I'm with the man I saw in my dreams
Your kiss feels like a summer day
Got me so open in every way
The glow they all see is because of you
All the men in the world, you I choose
I just can't erase this smile
Living with you in the now

[Chorus]Tamar Braxton
I can't go a day without you
Without you nothing else matters
Boy you seem to make me better
Baby, baby I'm just saying
I love you

[Verse 3]Tamar Braxton
I love you till you're old and gray
Even then you'll be my fantasy
We gon' stand the test of time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Promise nothing 'bout you will ever change
Cause everything about me will stay the same
You give me everything I need
I'm in love and still I'm free

[Chorus]Tamar Braxton
I can't go a day without you
When I'm with you nothing matters
Boy you seem to make me better
Baby, baby I'm just saying
I love you

I love you

I do, love you
