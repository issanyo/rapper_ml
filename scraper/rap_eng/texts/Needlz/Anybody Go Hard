[Intro]
Calling all women and children who got that
Mutual feeling you ready to slay the fake shit
This is a ritual killing
So celebrate they demise in fact we
Filming it live I just entered the courtroom
Ya Honors here All Rise, All Rise , All Rise
They all shallow, I wonder why

[Hook]
Does anybody go hard
Does anybody go hard
Do anybody make real shit anymore
Does anybody go hard
Does anybody go hard
Do anybody make real shit anymore

[Verse 1]
One of my favorite MCs his name is Andre 3K
But why he only drop an album every 3000 days
I miss Miss Lauryn Hill she was the best we ever got
You never know when it's your time if you’ll be ready or not
But here I come come come
To change the game from A to Z
So in my humble opinion humility ain't for me
Who could undo the poison who could be the IV
Why me, Needlz and Honors E
All them on the radio they balling
But you fans working at Champs and can't even afford a Spalding
Being who you are is lost
It used to come from the heart and reach hearts
Tell the truth I ask myself UH

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everybody say they paid its prolly counterfeit cake
I should hold ’em up to the light see which one of y'all fake
All I see is fake gays, fake hair and fake breasts
And fake blood everywhere is this a scary movie set
What y'all don’t get is they privatizing prisons
Damn, that’s the next plan
Last year, they made more cells then Def jam
While gas prices up, food prices out risen it
All you get's a bag of air with 6 or 7 chips in it
Rap shit so limited think about what the image is
Funny how the illiterate guys got the longest sentences
It's all about how you look
Lie just say you got it good
While steal from the broke and give to the rich
Swear they reverse Robin hoods
Are you real, I mean yo, what's original
All the people that listen fake as the people they listen to
I swear being who you are is lost
It used to come from the heart and reach hearts
Tell the truth I ask myself, UH

[Hook]
