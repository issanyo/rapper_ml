[Verse 1:]

Diary of my life on the track
But what I started writing started writing back
And talkin bout my pops and moms
And them blocks and them bombs
Sometimes I wonder who sane, Barack or Saddam
Cause them shots and yo them blocks they still the same homie
But in people's pockets all that’s constant is change homie
Homie, I used to hang wit the Wu-Tangers
'Til my mans got hit wit 36 chambers
Swear Im numb to it, so hardcore
Tryin' to undo it in my mind
But I'm off course in my Sudan thinkin' 'bout Darfur
Tryin' to let go of the pain and the bruises in my brain
It's so useless I just throw it to the flames
And then use that fuel for my fuses
Let it Burn

[Verse 2:]

I just departed from my home town
It's half dead closed own
Flags everywhere we been invaded by a ghost town
People in them projects they be fightin' in the field
I seen my homie switch sides
Turn to Vikings for the bills and
Steelers for the bucks
In the streets we was rebels we had beef wit police
Duke’d it out the blue devils uh
My retrospecs’ on I'm drained
I'm swerving through memory lane
Foot to the pedal tryin' to sustain
Swear I'm numb to it, so hardcore tryin' to undo it in my mind
But Im off course in my Sudan thinkin' 'bout Darfur
Trying to let go of the pain and the bruises in my brain
Its so useless I just throw it to the flames
And then use that fuel for my fuses
Let it Burn

[Verse 3:]

Let me be clear it's a been spell
If you been here it's been hell
If you can't tell is hard to exhale when u inhale
See these students, no grammar
Hella high school on campus
Why it feel like every child life behind’s the fucking standard
Ghetto Americana
Church’s prayin why ain’t no changes grandma
Its because its unanswered questions unquestioned answers
Hella C.O.’s no C.E.O’s
Hella subway sandwich artistses
No heroes a lot people goin crazy
Don’t see dough, lotta ego
So the attitude that we know
Is I;ll put you in a box if Im P.O.’d
That’s pissed off, that’s postal
A lot of people be posted
Both sides of the block, no free throw
Amigo, I'm out chea next to Reverend Rollo Goodlove play’n Cee-Lo
Hella coppers, no halos
Hella Doctors, no payrolls
See hell has held us hostage and we still think hell is hot shit
See I'm fired up for the mamas
Hella fired up for they daughters
See times up time to rise up and turn they wines into water
So put ya problems to a lighter (Let it burn)
We are now fightin' fire wit fire (Let it Burn)
Light up all ya fears and ya doubts until they are undone
Melt ya problems and send ’em to the other side of the sun
Let It Burn
