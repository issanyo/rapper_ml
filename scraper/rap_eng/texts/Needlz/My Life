[Hook]
Hustling trying to get that dough
Another day, it's another struggle
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)

[Verse 1]
You can take a kid out the slums, but never vice versa
Across the street from dope, two lights from murder
Ain't too many ways for me and pies to merger
Now that mickey d's just slinging fries & burgers
Had dreams of nice clothes, rolling in cars
I had never seen working at that golden arch
You see, I couldn't dribble much, jumpshot wasn't water
I started with weed, then flooded blocks with water
My pops not around, moms saying I'm hell bent
Hell sent, just tried to help with the rent
I'm paying bills at 16, you Gotta' love it
Offered mom the bread, she ain't wanna touch it
Said If I can't follow the rules, I gotta move
Find a new hangout, then "Juice" came out
Then tools came out, and I was feeling like Bishop
Might as well go all out, you got one life so live it

[Hook]
Hustling trying to get that dough
Another day, It's another struggle
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)
So what if my pants sag low?
Just sit back and inhale that smoke
This is my life
(My life, my life, my life, my life!)

[Verse 2]
Look, It's not an album
Dropouts get drunk, smoke dust
Till you start feeling like you a falcon
Contemplating jumping while you standing on the balco-ny
Mix a little weed and this'll be the outcome
More haze I puff made me feel like I was brave enough to Bust
And ten grades was enough
Tried to scare me straight, took my kicks and threw 'em
Transparent lifers, I seen right through 'em
They couldn't get to 'em, my money still flowing in
Girls is watching, they now noticing
Like here we go again, oh! Po-Po again
On they walkie talkies saying "We got Joe again"
Move at my own process, cool with every C.O
Just skipped getting processed, thats what I call progress
Digest us being America's Nightmare
Young, black and trying to get rich, we ain't quite there

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I love Hip Hop culture, helps me get through my fans
We buy clothes too big, it made us feel little for years
Yeah, they tried to underhand us, we speak in our own slang
So only our niggas can understand us
And nah, I ain't pulling my pants up
Don't cross the street when you see me, nigga, man up
We trying to do everything they said we couldn't
Wear my hat to the side cause society say I shouldn't
I'm far from ashamed, I remember being yay' high watching "Purple Rain"
The club owner sayin' "They ain't understanding ya' music, things change"
How you tell Prince he wouldn't last in the game?
And we feeling the same, thats sort of like what they told us
Cause shits on our shoulders
We keep chipping at it as we get older
The temps dropping and shits getting colder
Throw my hood and boots on, going out like a soldier

[Hook]
