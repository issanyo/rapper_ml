[Verse 1: BLAQGxLD]
Wanna be with you
That’s only you
I still dig you
So don’t it feel sweet?
Distance makes the…heart grow fonder
I need space to…love you better

[Verse 2: Willie Hyn]
Your love, three minutes to India
She sung about galaxies
And I don’t really wanna be that far from your love
Who knows runnin’ better than you?
Don’t you blame it on allergy
Ain’t no after me—what’s up?

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild & BLAQGxLD]
If you give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit
Give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit, yeah

[Verse 3: Musiq Soulchild]
I’ve been sober…since last October
Don’t come no closer
Unless you’re ready to change, oh no
The way you’re speakin’, just got me thinkin’
Might be reachin’ for things that will stay the same

[Verse 4: Willie Hyn]
Are we throwing the Jacob in trash?
Are we wasting our time?
Are we spinning our wheels?
Rat races were fine
Until I found out I wasn’t the only one standing in line
Girl, I give you a sign

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild & BLAQGxLD]
If you give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit
Give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit, yeah

[Bridge: Willie Hyn]
Understanding if you can stand it
I want your world, take control Mrs. Janet
Baby, just (give me your…)
Patience, I need you to see me out
Producing love songs for you so they won’t beat me out
(If you give me your…) Word, I’ll give you my heart
Acting like I forgot my lines, now I’m just playing my part
(Give me your…) Love, don’t run from the drug
Promise the lives above and that’ll take care of us, yeah

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild & BLAQGxLD]
If you give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit
Give me your time, just a little bit
I wanna free your mind, just a little bit
Give me your love, just a little bit
Don’t seem like enough but I give you just a little bit, yeah
