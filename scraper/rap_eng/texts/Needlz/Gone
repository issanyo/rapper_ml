In the middle of the club blowin endo
Rolling up a swishers sweet, fat as Mr Winslow
Cause right now only family matters
And all these other niggers pissed cause they got little bladders
I came to shatter haters dreams kill they self esteem
Don't try to make it now my niggas this ain't maybelline
You have made it seem no body like me
And now I ain't gay so I don't care if niggas like me
Bitches know I'm cooler and I rock like Mikey
I, I, I rock things way out of your price range
We don't look at price tags never will never have
Just ask for they forgiveness later on
When you see my chick you see a chick that you will never have
And that's a concept you will never grasp
I'm the shit fertilizer in that greener grass
I'm bout to eat rama down watch these niggas fast
Now puff puff pass now and pour another glass

We on
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get your glass up baby get your ass up)

My momma asked me is the bragging really necessary
I say no but this shitt is gonna make me legendary
And I apologize for cussing, but when it come to rap I don't apologize for nothing
Disgusting nigga yuck to the maximum
These rap niggas rerun I'm yelling what's happening
Even if they get me they fucking with closed captioning
When you niggas dis me you ain't gettin no reaction
Cause emotions is for women and niggas who just be sittin when they pissin I ain't asking for permission
I'll just ask for they forgiveness later on
After I take the throne and bring it back to my home
No we on like the opposite of off, come from the same cloth
With TI get some Andre, Hov, and some Kanye
So how can they make saying Donnis ain't the illest where even the hottest niggas consider the boy a menace
Now we on

Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
Gone
Lets get some green lets get some drink lets get it on
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
Say tonight we gonna get going going gone
( get yo ass up baby get your ass up)
