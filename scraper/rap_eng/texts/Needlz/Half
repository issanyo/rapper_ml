[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Half a zombie, I got white bitches like Abercrombie
Popped the vyvanse and it hit me like a titan, yeah
I flew Delta and I flexed it like it's private, yeah
How much you spent to take her out? I spend a grip on my bitch
Cause I got it, I got it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it
Don't trip, I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Quentin MIller]
Addy's takin' hold now, I'm on a roll now
Oh you niggas know us now? I'm touchin' road now
I linked up with Needlz, he ten minutes from the house
Just like your TV, we in the house, in the house, yeah
Niggas pocket-watchin', niggas pocket-watchin'
Wait, bitches pocket-watchin', that is not a problem
Niggas thought that they could stop 'em, but they not gon' stop me
With your girl, I change the topic to that sloppy-toppy
Got a new thing out in Vegas
I got hoes in different area codes like Nate did
Flex up on my haters by mistake and
Coach Cam roll in flagrance
And I put on for my city and my state
Middle fingers to my enemies and all the ones they came with
Hold up wait, '97 made the lane switch
Hold up wait, it's a shame cause I can't miss

[Hook: Quentin Miller]
Half a zombie, I got white bitches like Abercrombie

Cause I got it, I got it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it
Don't trip, I got it, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
(Pour some, my young niggas is zombies)
I looked up with Quentin at the Tidal show, I know he got me
You bet my 'gera you a jack-ass
They know not to try me
I can tell by what they rockin' that they pocket-watchin'
I think he shop at Buffalo Exchange, that's not Armani
Houston we have a problem, man niggas rocket-launchin'
I think they contemplating stoppin', that is not a option
Drinkin Tequila old-fashioned with my new bitch
Ayye, shout to my Uncle Frank
Stella, I got my groove back
Tell me who's the goat, I'm really lampin' in that lambo
I don't wear Bape no more, I'm in the cut like I wear camo
This white girl with me, she got lips like Little Black Sambo
You mad in movie clips, right now I feel like fucking rambo
Ayye, Zoe Kravits, let her know I just might shoot the club up
Ayye, hol' up, wait
Let's have a baby girl, I'll lose the rubber
Ayye, hol' up, wait
SSX, tricky flex maneuvers
I'm leanin' like I'm jason off a half of Freddy Krueger
