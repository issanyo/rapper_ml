[Intro]
Yeah, Webby
See I've been doing this shit for a while
I know
We 'bout to hit the skyline now

[Verse 1]
I don't know about you, but I know one thing
I been fighting for my dream, bitch, throw me in the ring
We start to see the sun when you going through the rain
It's hard to feel good when you going through the pain
I was thinking about the days I was up on stage
Back when everything was going my way
But life came through with the hurricane
So I kept the fire lit like Duraflames
Swerved in the third lane
Webby on dready, back and all ready
Killing round two in this game, they not ready
I lose my damn self, knees weak, palm sweaty
In a free-fall, rest in peace to Tom Petty
Then I snapped out of it
Killed it, the crowd dug it
I made it to the summit and did it without a budget
My stock going up the moment it go public
I trust you gon' love it

[Hook]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream gotta feel the same
If it ain't given to me, then I'ma take it
So let me just fly, fly, meet me outside
Ain't nobody killing my vibe
So let me just fly, fly, fly, fly
Disappear into the skyline

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm top five, call me Dylan
With a pretty young thing I'ma slide on
And she getting undressed to them nylons
On my flight lift from the road that I ride on
Take off baby I'm gone, icon
Connecticut to Taiwan
They be getting they vibe on and put on my song
Flow tight as a python grip, I'm Qui-Gon
Got the flow of a Jedi
Hopping up on a red-eye
With red eyes from burning the diesel down like a semi
Them I'm flying up in the clouds
Only time I'm coming down is to rock crowds
So drop that landing gear
Bitch make way cause the champ is here
Let's have a hell of a year
Getting to a new altitude
They still ain't ready for this shit that I'm about to do

[Hook]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream gotta feel the same
If it ain't given to me, then I'ma take it
So let me just fly, fly, meet me outside
Ain't nobody killing my vibe
So let me just fly, fly, fly, fly

[Verse 3]
If you got a dream, you should follow it
Catch it, then you bottle it
See it and acknowledge it
Focus and accomplish it
This the university of life, no scholarship
Fuck a rat race, that ain't who I'm getting dollars with
But I want a lot of it, really cause I deserve
A piece of this damn pie that everybody's getting served
But I've learned to keep my head down and observe
How to play the long game, now it's my turn
The flow is ice cold like Jack in Titanic
Watching money come in, lean back in my hammock
Call action, goddamn it, get the cameras rolling
I've been chosen to murder the game and stay golden
Call me pony boy, they know me boy
From the coast of Japan out to Coney, boy
Whole world gonna see Dave and Joni's boy
Cause ain't a thing that'll hold a boy

[Hook]
I don't know about you but I know one thing
I ain't gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream gotta feel the same
If it ain't given to me, then I'ma take it
So let me just fly, fly, meet me outside
Ain't nobody killing my vibe
So let me just fly, fly, fly, fly
Disappear into the skyline
(That said I'ma take off, that said I'ma take off)
Disappear into the skyline
(That said I'ma take off, that said I'ma take off)
Disappear into the skyline
(That said I'ma take off, that said I'ma take off)
Disappear into the skyline
(That said I'ma take off, that said I'ma take off)
Disappear into the skyline
