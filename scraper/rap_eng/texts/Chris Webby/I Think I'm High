[Hook: Emilio Rojas]
Two blunts in, a fifth of Henny down
Another one lit, they 'bout to pass it around
Like, ah, yeah, I think that I'm high, yeah
Another one lit, sitting in a cloud
Eyes blood red, the room's spinning around
Like, ah, yeah, I think that I'm high, yeah

[Verse 1: Emilio Rojas]
And I feel like my life is changing, and I don't get faded
But  all the homies gone, and all the homies wasted
And they walk me down so they treating us like we famous
Now, they bring in liquor and women and medications
We sitting alone in a room, a towel the window, the door
To keep in the smoke, she gonna blow, we don't be wandering in, and out of the hall
Blowing a little bit in my face and it's be feeling like I'm in a call
Like I'm hit with a shotgun, shotgun to the head like a firing squad
And I'm not a smoker but, all my people rolling up
When they hit that blunt and it get another open, and they open up
I told her I think it's sexy when she lick the Kush
You know these ladies nowadays they just get lit and fuck
What I live my life in, you ain't gotta like it
Even pussy kill you like Isis Taylor was ISIS
Everyone addicted to something, that's just how life is
And I'll never be the one that'll judge you for vices
That's why the homies...

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
I been having trouble sleeping I should smoke something
I been having trouble eating, I should smoke something
They told me I don't need a reason, I should smoke something
I don't need a reason I should smoke something
Yeah, and my people are telling me maybe that smoking a little will help with the pain
And my people are telling me maybe that smoking a little will help me create
So I sit back in the crowd, looking a little bit into the haze
Sneaking aways, I'mma get it while I'm in the middle of getting a daze
Yeah, when you the only sober one is when it takes the longest
You just wanna leave and everybody wanna stay there talking
It's when you babysit, everyone you came in with
They wake up and you laughing at them, telling them the things they did
But shit I gotta have control, so I don't chase no high's homie I be getting low
And I don't have no hopes of my [?] passes getting faded, reaching out to us
My ex out the equation like I'm doing fucking Algebra
I tell a hater do the math, my people in the back getting stupid off of half
A couple grams to the face, a couple dabs, while I'm sliding with two bitches to the back

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I don't think that I'm high homie, I know that shit
When your [?] breaking up and then she roll that shit
Passed to my leftie, staring at me as I hold that shit
He like "I'm focused on this money, smoke that shit"
Oh yeah, if I wasn't the stoner life of the party
I'd remember lots of shit, but my memory's working hardly
Leaving clues like the dude in my mental writing memos
And stuff I need to do on the back of my hands in a purple sharpie
What a bang, bang, boogie, Mary Jane strain cooked me
And now I'm absent minded like my brain playing hookie
But I keep myself composed, you know this kid ain't a rookie
Backstage with Emilio like "yo, just hit it you pussy"
Nah, nah, to each his own, it's whatever floats your boat
Some people pop molly and some people sniff coke
Some people drop acid and some people smoke weed
But if you're sober you're going to catch a contact around me
