Yeah, check it
It's my life
It's my life

[Verse 1: Danimal Lector]
I can't go every day with being sober
It gets kind of hard trying to cope with this devil on my shoulder
Belve and some soda
Like well I'm getting closer to either heaven or hell
Every second I get older
Till I'm dead or in a coma I'mma live life like well
It ain't over till it's over
You're supposed to live every day like it was your last
But that and itself is a really hard concept for me to grasp
Cause if this was my last 24
I'd probably spend at least 3 or 4 praying to God for 20 more
I'm looking in the mirror at the man in front of me
Like I know everybody goes, but I'm 23
That's why I come off as reckless, respect it
I'm getting my moneys worth every second
I'm less than perfect, but so are you
So who are you to judge me? I don't judge you, yeah

[Hook]
(I'm not sober all the time
And you bring me down
At least you try
But till we see this eye to eye
I don't want you.)
[X2]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
What's life? Fuck life, yo I'm telling you what
I'm a nineteen year old rebellious fuck
Living each day like the next I might not wake up
That's why I always stay puffin' a blunt with a full cup
Poppin' pills out the bottle till it's hollow
I'm going to hell and y'all are more than welcome to follow
And if I'm not here tomorrow light an L in my memory
Pour out some Hennessy, fuck it, just remember me
Gotta know I made a mark on the short time I'm on Earth
Since birth I've been spittin' it, proving my fucking worth
And for what?
I try to give a fuck but I can't
Cause it sucks to be me, but I am who I am
And I am just a man who will stand with his hands in front of him
Just waiting for some shit to hit the fan
And I cannot stop, music fuels my every movement
And drug abusing helps bring creativity to my music
I may not be into a reality, but my music is sick
And I'm so high that I defy gravity
So fuck being sober, live life and enjoy it
Yeah, cause soon enough the ride will be over
