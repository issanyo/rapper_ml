[Intro]
Say that's fer sher
And that's fer sher
That's fer sher
That's fer sher

[Hook]
I'm a beast (that's fer sher)
Kill a beat (that's fer sher)
Spittin' heat
Cause you know I play for keeps (that's fer sher)
Rap nice (that's fer sher)
Plus I'm white (that's fer sher)
Just give me the mic
I'mma kill it damn right (that's fer sher)

[Verse 1]
I'm a punch line prodigy
Dope? Yo, I gotta be
Spit it and flip it and get 'em jumpin' like a wallaby
But I ain't no Rocko's Modern Life
Still these kids are watching me
Sicker than pathology
I'll vomit on you, probably
Keep rhythm like Tommy Lee
Now tell me who's stopping me?
So everybody stand up, get them hands up like a robbery
I'm a hot commodity, bangin' bitches condom free
Chuggin' bottles till I'm more fucked up than the economy
Mic check, one two, one two three four five six seven eight nine
I generate rhymes
I don't live in state lines
Spit so sharp I can penetrate spines
I rap fer sher
With a bag of the herb, yes sir
Observing actual words, and I rap from the curb
To my pad in the burbs
I'm a bull moving up from the back of the herd

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Said that's fer sher
When I come and show up right at your door
Smack your jaw, got you drinkin' dinner through a plastic straw
Rap it raw, speaking hard
Caption, just put me in charge
I'mma treat 'em like astronomers, they'll be seeing stars
A rap flower, take your chick and bend her back over
Cause I hit more pussy than abusive cat owners
Never catch my ass sober, I'm always passed out
And yeah your girl's a dime, well mine's a half ounce
I hit a track, bounce, rip it when I speak slow
I'm just a wild boy, you could call me Steve-O with a mean flow
Rockin' my jeans low, reppin' the burbs to the fullest
That's where I be, bro
Cause I'm a dog, I shop at Petco
See? I'm just a crazy ass white boy S-O-B
I could murder rock n' roll to a techno beat
With a weed sack stickier than a gecko's feet
Gee, girlies can't help themselves lookin' at the kid
Cause I'm so damn hot they gotta put me in the fridge
You heard, that's my word
Chris Webby be the illest mother fucker in the burbs
And yes, that is fer sher

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah
It's Chris Webby
And that's fer sher...
