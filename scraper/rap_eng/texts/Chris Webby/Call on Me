[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up 'cause the bars on me
We be going all night 'til the stars get bright
And the moon light falls on me
Universe and harmony, vibe so right bet it all on me
Wanna have a good time, then call the landline
Yeah it's fine, you can call on me

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You can call on me ain't no call waitin'
I'ma pick up, first ring on my land line
Headed down to the Keys with a pretty young thing
With them tight ripped jeans showing tan lines
And I ain't worried about nothing
You can hit me on the wifi
Send that location I'm coming
I'll hit your hot spot girl you know I-I-I-I
I give it to you like that
You can see them three dots when I write back
You know its simple, similar to a light snack
When I bite that, let me be your night cap
Girl, you can call me in the night, man
If its chaotic, I got it, baby I'm right there
Call me young Star-Lord flying though the cosmos
But I got my iPhone, just in case you call on me
You can put it all on me, lil mama
I think it just dawned on me that I wanna
Take this night to the limit, I know you like it, admit it
So baby you just gotta dial the digits and meet me at the bodega I'ma pop a bottle and some papers
And we can get lost, take a flight to Malaysia
Call on me I got unlimited data
I'll be as quick as Sonic on my Sega

[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up 'cause bars on me
We be going all night 'til the stars get bright
And the moon light falls on me
Universe and harmony, vibe so right bet it all on me
Wanna have a good time, then call the landline
Yeah it's fine, you can call on me
Baby, you can call on me, call on me
Listen baby, you can call on me, call on me

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
You can call on me, ain't no call waiting
I'ma pick up first ring on my land line
She about 5'3" with them tattoo sleeves and her eyes on me looking damn fine
We got no need for discussion yeah we always on the same page
I just give her that McLovin, feel like we been in the bed for days
Got a bitty in the city who be riding with me
Lil modern hippy rolling sticky 'til she got me dizzy
You can parley with me, 'bout the world baby
I don't really think I ever met no one like you in my life
She beautiful, tight and smart, the Miss Universe type
And I just hope that I'm maneuvering right
So uh, hey ma, let's ride, alright
Baby girl, listen we gonna get it on tonight
You can meet me in the bedroom
Or that black muscle car with the leg room
On the coast line she my Ariel on the beach
Thick as Jessica Rabbit but she the Belle to my Beast
My Lola Bunny on the court hitting all 3's
Or my Jasmine, heir to the throne that I seek
My Mulan on the battlefield, Nala to my pride
No surprise that I got you on my mind

[Chorus: Alandon]
Pardon me when I pull up with a small army
Better drink up cause bars on me
We be going all night 'til the stars get bright
And the moon light falls on me
Universe and harmony, vibe so right bet it all on me
Wanna have a good time, then call the landline
Yeah it's fine, you can call on me
Baby, you can call on me, call on me
Listen baby, you can call on me
