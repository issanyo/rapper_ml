[BarsTaLoan]
Flying in the car, looking like a star, just like a galaxy
Go so hard like a callus be, uh
Burning more things than calories

[Freestyle: Chris Webby]
Yo, it’s Chris Webby
At this party and shit, motherfucker wants me to rap
I’m about to open an abortion clinic right next to your local church
And go to narcotics anonymous hustling coke and percs
I’m just trying to piss you off, I really hope it works
Go berzerk, I got a dirty mouth, I’ll never hold a curse
Jerking off until my motherfucking shoulder hurts
Even if she vegan she gon swallow when my boner squirts
Help an older lady across the road, “hey can I hold your purse?”
Then kick her in front of a moving bus, “oh no, she’s hurt!”
Shit I’m pretty sure she’s dead but you can check yourself
While I run her wallet and spend all the money at Taco Bell
Anyone this deranged should surely be locked in jail
I’m on the grind but off the rails like an Eric Koston fail
I hit it rapid fire, try to pull out of a vaginal cavity
But busted while I was half inside her
Then I woke up in the morning and had a reminder
That she's getting plan B for breakfast with an apple cider
Someone pass the lighter, I need some weed to breathe in
He’s a demon, dirty mind, sneaky heathen
I don’t need a reason
I’m creeping up like sex offenders with binoculars on a beach in bikini season
You won’t see me leaving, I’m running through that
Stomp you to death then throw my Nike’s back on the shoe rack
Huh I’ma do that, why bother tryna bleach the blood stains out?
Somebody told me orange is the new black
So I scrub my white T til it turns the color copper
And use some Tide detergent and throw it up in the washer
I swear that I'm crazy though, shit you can ask my doctor
Psych, I’m off my rocker like an active grandfather, motherfucker

WEBBY: Your turn, bro

BarsTaLoan: I actually gotta save my voice for my open mic tomorrow, bro

KID: Oh man, get this coward out of here please. Please get this coward out of here...

WEBBY: Oh yeah? That’s cool bro. Seriously. (to party) Who wants to get back to drinking?!?!
