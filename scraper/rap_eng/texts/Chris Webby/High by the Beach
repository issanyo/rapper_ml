Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "High by the Beach"

[Intro]
Recline in your seat, while we ride to the beat
Cause all we wanna do is get high by beach
Get high by the beach, get high by the beach
All we wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high, get high, get high, get high get high, get so high
Get high, get high, get high, get high get high, get so high

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's because I'm selfish, I'm sorry but I can't help it
Cause I'm smoking by the coast and all my worries are neglected
For the moment for a second I'm not tweeting I'm not texting
I'm not calling, I'm not checking so don't bother with leaving a message
I'm not stressing in the least bit 'cos we just let that smoke fly
And I'm living it how I see fit from the sunrise to low tide
I'm so high don't know why my seat belt still on
I've been parked for 40 minutes, yo, damn this weed is strong
See I roll up and give it the flame
Now all of my windows are fogged out
This chronic pumping through my veins
Now all of my worries are crossed out
And I'm gone now like I'm Lana
High by the beach with marijuana
No road map, no ways out, no drama, nada

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high, (X4)

[Verse 2]
Karma's a bitch and life's a beach
Ain't shit sweet, the bottom is deep
The undertow is strong so watch your feet
Don't get carried away by the sea
Submerged under water by Davy Jones' Locker
With shellfish and lobsters and ancient sea monsters
From starboard to port, to weed back on shore
No life jackets needed, my ship stay on course
From Venice to Montauk, and way back to Norwalk
We spark up and then we get high
And you know that I be puffing as much as I can
Hit it and pass it then do it again
Tapping a blunt in my hand
Leaving this ash all over the sand
Don't need me a plan
Don't need me a schedule
'Cos I got medical indica edibles, feeling incredible
Fuck all the chemicals (up in the clouds,)
Extraterrestrial (hearing me now?)
Clear, now ready your ears
Bury your burden, and steady your chairs
No lifeguard on duty, you better beware
The current is currently pulling you where
You pass your pass now pass the swisher
Ask the captain, ask the skipper
Get your scuba mask and grab the flippers
Bitches

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high, (X4)

[Outro]
Recline in your seat, while we ride to the beat
'Cos all we wanna do is get high by beach
Get high by the beach, get high by the beach
All we wanna do is get high by the beach
