I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana
I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I got a problem and my brain is moving slower than fuck
There'll be a foot of snow in hell before I'm sobering up
I got my dutchie in the cobra clutch
High as fuck, eyes glassy while I roll up a blunt
Got my windows rolling up, cruising baking out the whip
Starting with that beaster bud, then I upgraded it to piff
Always got a joint lit and my bubbler packed
Blunt wrapped in twenty secs
No one's fucking with that
Got my sticky sour diesel and my AK-47
Purple kush and northern lights, open the bag and you'd be smelling
The most incredible fragrance, roll it up and blaze it
If you got a problem to, then follow when I say it

[Hook: Mike Jerz]
I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana
I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana
I think got a problem

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Some people say that weed will not affect they way you live
They say that it's not a problem but my PO thinks it is
I'm just tryna roll a fatty up, homie mind your biz
So what if I'm half retarded from that purple that I twist
Burning like [?]
All this fuckin THC in my system is drivin' me
To absolutely insanity, I know you understandin' me
Just to get out of bed I got to roll myself a gram or three
Still you know my gram will be impeccable, incredible
Even if my handwriting is hardly ever legible
Mary Jane's my baby girl, put her on a pedestal
[?] any time your L is full

I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana
I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I got a problem, showin' up to rehab with a weed bag, I need that
Roll it, light it, smoke it then repeat that
I been strung out on coke, got a dependency to ecstasy
Did so many pharmaceuticals I should be [?]
Now I gotten old, learned a lot up in the game
All I really need beside me is my baby Mary Jane
Shit I'm runnin' low on cells in my brain
I lost my motherfuckin' marbles
Doctor can't your nurses tell I'm insane
So lock me up and throw away the key
Just let me bring an eight with me
Some papers and a lighter I don't care where they be taking me
So roll a J for me, baby ride with me
Puff puff pass, till my people gettin' high with me

[Hook: Mike Jerz]
I think I got a problem
Addicted to marijuana
