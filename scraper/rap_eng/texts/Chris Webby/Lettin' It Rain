These are my struggles the downs with the ups and now everything's changed
Reached for the top til I've got it and now nothings ever the same
So I'm letting it rain, yeah I'm letting it rain
Said I'm letting it rain, I'm letting it rain

[Verse 1]
Ive been down on my luck so long that my worlds upside down
Sitting with an empty bottle in the gutter looking for an upside now
Yeah I'm living down my dream but like everything that you love might drown
You and all the problems that you've never seen creeping on up right now
Mo money, shit you know the rest now the rain's falling yo
But I gotta keep focused making musics really all i know
Spent my whole life dreaming of the stage tearing down all these shows
Now my girls leaving me cuz' I'm going back on the road
Its bitter sweet watching your career blowing up but your personal life
Falls apart in front of you but whatchu gonna do it ain't personal right
Like the stability be filling me with feeling that's driving me crazy tonight
Home sick, don't trip, at least I'm fucking making it right
I love my job so damn much I'm letting it consume me
Got me thinking that the only happy is happening in movies
You can try to change the locks but I'm always gonna get a new key
Let my soul bleed cuz I'm giving you the true me

These are my struggles the downs with the ups and now everything's changed
Reached for the top til; I've got it and now nothings ever the same
So I'm letting it rain, yeah I'm letting it rain
Said I'm letting it rain, I'm letting it rain

[Verse 2]
Losing sleep, i dun tried counting sheep
But i got bills to pay, and i got accounts to keep
Seeing through tired eyes wishing that i found some peace
Smoking cigarettes and drinking whiskey going through a fucking ounce a week
Trying to tone that down now, but i need a way I can escape it
Got stay hungry though, now i got a lot up on my plates
This life i chose, never lets me be complacent
Thank god b cuz yo, I'm finally outta the basement
Yo i love it, and i hate it people love me, and they hate me
And they judge me, cuz they ain't me
Its enough to drive a person crazy
Starting rumors, trying to take me off the path I've been on lately
Trying to put me down, like i had a fucking case of rabies
So follow me baby come step in my shoes
Then we'll see who will be singing the blues
I am who i am and the same goes for you
Let me do what i do
