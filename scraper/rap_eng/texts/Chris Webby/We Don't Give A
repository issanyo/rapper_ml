[Intro]

You know if I'm not mistaken I think I can still smelll your wife's pussy stink on my gun
Hope it doesn't rust the barrel
Aw man
You know the stress of the day is really sittin' in on me

[Verse One: Danimal Lector]

Eyes open, you couldn't see the truth
Someone let the demon loose
This freakin' booth, better be semen proof
Cause I'm comin', peek a boo
With me to you, you're softer than Pikachu
I ain't talkin' through a speaker, dude
You'll be in a coffin in a week or two
What you need to do, is give me all your weed and booze
Or recieve a few parting gifts before your carcass is on the evenining news
I'm mean and rude, don't even move
People snooze, wake and bake
Flame thrower aimed at your face, I'mma heat the room
Carve your heart out of your chest with a greasy spoon
Reach for the moon, like the Legion of Doom
People assume me and Webb are like tatted up brothers
We are, two bad ass motherfuckers
You're sweeter than a splash of Puckers
Smashed in the back with a half'a glass of Jack, that was supper
13 is my magic number, so give me an additional dozen
Dick out, but no, I ain't pissin' in public

[Hook: Chris Webby]

We don't, give a, flying fuck what you think about us
Reconsider, your next step, best bet, is to keep your mouth shut

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]

Let me get my Aderral prescript, yeah I'm back in this bitch
With punchlines that'll knock 'em off balance and shit
Shit, I've add it with this straightjacket
Someone unlatch it
Cause I'm batshit crazy, the monster under your matress
Tri-state T-Rex, gotta wear a 3X
Pushin' haters buttons like a DS
We next
Fuckin' Devils Reject, with a taste for blood
A bottle of Jack Daniels, and an eighth of bud
See I finally have made it to the spot that you would kill for
Flowin' up to par, Happy Gilmore
And all these people wonder why I haven't settled and signed a deal for
But shit I'm makin' money, time to make a couple mil more
Rip a beat; villainous
Killin' it with the literate
So step to me, my best advice, would be to reconsider it
Webbby played the game and I don't need a fuckin' cheat code
So brace yoursef bitch, I'm about to go beast mode

[Hook: Chris Webby]

We don't, give a, flying fuck what you think about us
Reconsider, your next step, best bet, is to keep your mouth shut
