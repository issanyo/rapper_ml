[Hook]
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you

[Verse 1 - Chris Webby]
Yeah
They gon' know my name for generations
For these revolutionary revelations
And as humanities headed for devastation
I'mma be the only thing standing when it caves in
Weapons carved from the bones of my enemies
War paint with the blood of my critics
Keep my kingdom in control with telepathy
Get up in your mind, when I'm done, you'll admit it, I'm the king
See my name engraved on the monuments
Don't remember how I was embraced by the populous
From my castles excavated by the paleontologists
And they read my tales written by the ancient astrologists
Got the strength of a warrior
The legend that they can’t see the stories of
At the apothecary sipping on the formula
I could rain down fire when I’m scorching the
Earth, right underneath you, beat you down
Defile, defeat you, and just leave you
Nobody’ll try to reach you
Can’t win when I rise, my design is lethal
World domination I don’t got no time for peaceful, I
Rule the land with the love and touch of an iron fist
Battle scars running deeper than my epidermis
Cause when the crown’s in your clutch, there’s a higher risk
Just take a seat upon the thrown, you’ll be getting nervous
Sweating, second guessing the stressing that you could easily fall
The traitors and snakes will cheer and applaud
Then the second that your back’s turned, kill you in broad day
Light, then paint your story on the pyramid walls, I’ve witnessed it all believe me
The son of Nefertiti with the brain of Archimedes that’s tucked up under my beanie
No peace treaty, I’m greedy, I’m leaving these lands cauterized
Until my name is immortalized, yeah

[Hook]
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you

[Verse 2 – KXNG Crooked]
Yeah
Philosophic as Pythagoras
Skin bronze as Jesus of Nazareth, that and my woolly hair
Police seem to think it’s hazardous
I ain’t Rodney but I’m the king of L.A., they just unaware
My crown is unanimous before I was standing on this land with indigenous people cheefing on cannabis
I ruled half of the Africas, and my word to [?] brought patience like the back of a ambulance
You just wasn’t there
That’s why I brought in this historical columnist
Herodotus to document my father in his sarcophagus
So write a history piece, and take it back to fifth century Greece
Tell him he was omniscient, while you at it tell em’ that I’m the shit
Even theologists, put my name on colleges and philosophy scholarships
Dissertations written on my thoughts and accomplishments
Then they’ll use my memoirs to shape modern politics
They’ll put my name in great books, and Holy Scriptures
When the snakes and crooks want you to forget how my face looks
They’ll hire artists bigger than Michelangelo to paint a false image of me
In phony pictures
Conspiracy theorists dig deeper, when my body’s deceased my name will defeat the Grim reaper
Put my face on the sphynx, like all hail Egypt
But king wherever I Rome, like all twelve Caesars
Even when I’m enslaved, and captured like a titan
The gods, on Mount Olympus will be frightened at the mere sight of my songwriting
Ballad of lifelong fighting, and soon as I’m free, I’m striking Zeus with his own lightning
Bounce back from more challenges until I’m back in my palace
Sipping elixir from fabulous chalices
Known as a top war strategist, my name strikes paralysis
Into all my antagonists

[Hook]
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you
They'll know my name
After the stars are passing through
They'll know my name
When they forgot about you
