[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Stay chuggin' on the 40 ounce, brain cells fried
Like a clam strip, all day get high
Neverending Story, Falcor stay fly
Mom's a math teacher, so I gotta multiply
Not a mathematician myself so I ride, In my 98 Altima parked outside
Hustlin' mixtapes, I’m tryna get by, double U E double B follow with a Y
Motha fucka that’s me and I be so cool
To be on my level your gonna need a step stool
Always been a troublemaker gotta break rules
Breakin' every law until they kick me out of school
So amped up, you think I’m chuggin jet fuel
Chasin' a bottle of moon shine with an O'Doules
Since O'Doyle rules, let me pull a Billy Madison
And have em slippin' on banana peels if they challenge him
I"m bafflin' any competitor with what I'm rappin' and
The futures lookin' bright I think I’m starin' at a halogen
Born in '88, I got it tatted on my abdomen
Product of the 90s, everyday practicin'
Then it started happenin, turned into a beast
Full bred pit with a little Maltese
Woof, slaughter any track I see
Youve now been warned, you’d better hide your beats

[Hook]
I'mma never give a fuck about you
I’m just doing what I do
Murder any beat I put my mind too
Thought you knew that’s what I do
Rappin on the mike till my face turns blue
Through and through that’s what I do
That’s what I do

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Stop sleepin' over there, man pass the blunt
L ride around town and be back for lunch
Got a full plate of beats and some Captain Crunch
Mean on the mic, only lost a battle once
Everybody else, murked em, cooked it up, served em
Pen in hand, I got the dexterity of a surgeon
Freestyles burn em, written rhymes flawless
Like the names of every Mutant Ninja Turtle, I'm an artist
Bitch, nobody stoppin' what I’m sayin'
Lyrical display gone shock em like Raiden
Everyday ragin', show me where the party’s at
Where the bitches where the broads where the hotties at?
Where the liquor where the bud, where the Molly at?
Where the stage? I'm bouta give the crowd a heart attack
Life’s short so you know I gotta live it up
Brim low, dutch rolled, I’ma never give a fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
All I got's my word and my balls just a nerd with a cause
Livin' life like a video game, so press pause
Double tap X with a shot to the brain
Backback square, catch em' with the scorpion chain
So get over here bitch, I'll kick em' like Liu Kang
And fatality anybody who shits on my name
It's that tatted up tyrant, heatin' up the climate
Pissin' on these haters like puppies on fire hydrants
It's that motherfuckin' Optimus Rhyme
Full bottle of pills, blunted, with a bottle of wine
Fully transform bout to take over the game soon
Ain't’ no mothafucka I’m afraid to bring the flame to
Got em rotisserie while I be smokin' piffery
Makin' words connect like letters written in calligraphy
Not a person here steppin' in my shoes
Cause C. Webby's back, and this is what I do

(Hook)
