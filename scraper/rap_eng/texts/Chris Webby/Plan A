[Hook: Devvon Terrell]
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Every step I take, I hear don't give up now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
And so we always say, fuck a plan B
Everyday we gon' go for plan A

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
The mind plays tricks on a young artist
Like why they going the furthest but I'm working the hardest
Bombarded with comments by fans
Like "you the man but how come you still live in an apartment?"
Dirty carpet
Regardless the mic's on
Write songs to find my way through the darkness
I promise you don't want to start shit
Looking like I barely started but these rhymes ready for harvest
Office job wasn't meant for me
I'm meant to be on stage and the kids will scream
Rip the beat
Lyrics don't let me get to sleep
I partner and forget what I did achieve
History repeats itself
And I'll repeat myself
Until the day they fucking get it
I committed to spittin' everything I've ever written
It's worth a listen and sittin'
And that's the reason I'm trippin'
Not to mention I ain't never had a plan B
Family I got to support, don't want them in the damn streets
They're supportive cause they knowin' what I can be
A lot of goals but it's feeling like I can't reach
Can't speak on a lot of things
I'm hoping that they all work out
Until then I'm just chillin' with a pen
Droppin' songs every week and look how it all turns out
I was feeling burnt out
Now I'm feeling like it's go time
Give me the mic, boy, it's showtime
I did it on my own, no cosign
Cause other niggas, they got no rhymes
They wanna battle, then it's war crimes
I'll never be trapped in a box
Nigga watch when it drops
I'm-a get it on my own time

[Hook: Devvon Terrell]
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Every step I take, I hear don't give up now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
And so we always say, fuck a plan B
Everyday we gon' go for plan A

[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
Fuck plan B unless I came in a bitch
Felt suicidal like I want a vein to be split
Want to quit
Couldn't tolerate the pain, it's a risk
Wife gon' bitch cause I ain't made shit
This the third job I done lost
I want to sleep the pain off, I need a Tylenol PM
I ran out of reasons for breathing
I'm fucked up
Can't let all the bullshit defeat him
Yeah, I'm still writing in my notepad
Holding on, damn, I ain't made no stacks
My kid can't eat those raps
I need a moment like Kodak
If I had a time machine I'd go back
Nigga just won't piece those on the [?]
Girl think I'm out here fucking these whores
I'm out here grinding
Damn bitch, you ain't know that
Plan A, fucking up the alphabet
I'm-a make it to the world, Jarren up next
I've done been through enough stress
Dead broke, fucked up, and upset
It's a must that I progress
Tryin' to cope with the bullshit I blow sess
The other day I was hopeless
Now I'm 'bout to go hard 'til my soul rests
Chasing my dream 'til I catch it
Been running so long that a nigga near breathless
Death to them haters, I put forth the effort
I kill all the doubt, now you niggas respect us
I'm 'bout to make billions flood out my wrists
Go hard 'til we die, we gon' fuck up this bitch
To you niggas that said I would never be shit:
Look at us now, you can go suck a dick

[Hook: Devvon Terrell]
This is my inner struggle
Fighting through the game with every hit they cue the thunder
Feet don't fail me now
Every step I take, I hear don't give up now
Would you believe what I've been through
Sometimes I wonder what I get into
And so we always say, fuck a plan B
Everyday we gon' go for plan A

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Head's spinnin' like a fan blade
Give a fuck what I can or I can't say
Cause my end game looking so bright
That these people got to cover the microphone up with a damn lamp shade
Get a band-aid
Cause I'm hurting you
Better learn not to take it personal
Shit, I paid my dues
Earned my stripes
Back up before I murder you
Not with a gun though
Just with these flows that I bust, yo
Better run home
I'm a god damn monster
Coming out when the sun's low
Let me keep it one-hundo
I've been out here grinding
No cosign but I kept on climbing
Did it on my own from text to freestyling
Shows to merchandise, still I'm writin'
'Bout to get it all wrapped up
Had enough of never having my cash up
So I followed plan A, no backup
Now I got the momentum of 20 mack trucks
Going downhill
And it's finally getting recognized and that feels
So damn good
Cause I never sold out
Every step I just kept shit real
And really what more can you ask
Even if I'm not your musical preference
You gotta respect that
So just watch me as I live my dream
Pull up a seat and relax
Enjoy the show and watch me go
'Bout to give the whole game a smash
