Yeah, this is for all you shit talkin’ muthafuckas out there
Runnin’ your lip and shit
Cause if you push somebody to that limit
You push that wrong button, you feel me?
Dude bound to just turn around and fuckin’ injure you
Ya know what I mean?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You’ll get injured, grab around your neck with my hands
And choke out every fuckin’ last breath if I can
God damn, I’m usually mad stoned and friendly
But like anybody there are many sides to Webby
I don’t need a pistol, I’m leavin’ you knocked out
Show up at your mom’s house like, “Bitch whatchu want now?”
My sanity can’t be found, try to step hither
I’ll stab you in the liver with a pair of blunt scissors
Run up with a switch blade, flipped out displayin’
And slit my own throat first to show you I ain’t playin’
With a few beers in me I’m a rowdy muthafucka
So keep talkin’, I love it when you doubt me muthafuka
Cause when I feel aggression I just grab the closest weapon
And beat him in the skull with it until I make his head spin
Couldn’t matter less my skin color or complexion
I’m a nutcase for fuck sake so quit steppin’
You’ll get injured, and that’s just me bein’ truthful
I’m brutal, beat you to death with a pool noodle
You fuckin’ toy poodles can’t step to the fight
Leavin’ him drinkin’ every meal for the rest of his life

[Hook]
You’ll get injured, and nah I ain’t playin’ around
One punch make that ass lay on the ground
If you didn’t know before then I’m sayin’ it now
Yes I’m sayin’ it now, that you’re gonna get injured
And nah I ain’t fuckin’ with you
You can touch me or anyone in my crew
You can just ask anybody, it’s true
If I’m comin’ for you then you’re gonna get injured

[Verse 2: D. Lector]
Feelin’ like I’m wantin’ to kill
Straight ragin’, my boys are like, “Knowledge just chill”
But on the real my pockets are filled with pot and some pills
Ready to leave a muthafucka with some hospital bills
I’m not stoppin’ until, I see you drop and then spill
If the bleedin’ don’t kill you, lack of oxygen will
I’m a doctor, not like Phil, but more like Kevorkian
Get over here, I’ma bout to finish em like Scorpion
Stick my fingers in between your rib cage, force ‘em in
And straight open you up like an accordion
I ain’t tryna’ pretend that I’m the hardest
But all this, I'm a beast talk is just garbage
A light weight, I’m a lean two fifteen
Ruthless, ready to leave a tooth or two missing
I put the heat in ya mouth like a Hooters’ wing
And dunk shot after shot like playin’ hoops with Kareem
I’m rulin' as king, proceed cautious, I eat bosses
CT’s mine tell Rell to leave office
Try to cross me and rest in peace under crosses
Body full of more metal than Kanye’s jaw is

[Hook]
