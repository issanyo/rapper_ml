[Intro: Skrizzly Adams]
Why don't you sell your soul? (x5)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Now now now, they be tellin' me to sell my soul and
Shit I'm down where hell is frozen
'Til then imma freak the booth and leak the truth and proof like I'm Edward Snowden
We ain't takin' no Melatonin
Night crawlin' up in this bitch
I love to get rich
But if you think that I'd sell my soul to get that
Then suck on this dick, imma real one with an old soul, yeah
So smart with a cold heart
I, been killin' shit dolo
'Til I'm countin' money like Ozark
On my Jason Bateman, Walter White from Breaking Bad
Secure the bag to make a statement
Hulk smash 'til I break the pavement
From the underground up like I raise the basement
See I'm in a game full of corporate greed
Everybody in it for their wants and needs
They lettin' go of integrity just to be a celebrity
And that's not what I was born to be
I'm the people's champ, I took my chance and now I'm on
See my, numbers up, my crowd is strong
In a game full of hot today, gone tomorrow rappers who will not be around for long
I, outlast 'em, that, and out-rap â€˜em
I've seen the dark days, but now the clouds passing
Still independent, still I found passion
In smashin' these motherfuckers down to fragments
Metaphorically speaking 'cause I'm not a thug
But my words will turn into a sword when I'm preaching
And slaughter these heathens and then go to war with my demons
That tell me to

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
Sell your soul
Why don't you sell your soul? (x4)

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Now now I, gonna make it more simplified
My soul ain't for sale to the business ties
And I, run a small time enterprise
A Mom and Pop shop to these bigger guys
But I, get the whole crowd hypnotized ('cause a not a soul could ever touch the flow)
Lookin' like my fan base triplified (From the, believers to the juggalos)
The EDM kids to the fans of rap
And all in between that'll span the map
Now I got the wheel, never hand it back
And imma drive like a maniac
And imma never give a fuck about what y'all say
Listen imma do me 'til my dying day
When it all seem lost, I will find a way
And my head up on my pillow but I'm wide awake
All night and day, with a little bit of elbow grease
For the words and the melodies
I'm stackin' chips so ante up like M.O.P
Better bet on me (you better bet)
Yeah seen the top and I want that
Hell yeah I wanna drop, where the top at?
So I keep on settin' goals 'til I got that
But I'll never sell my soul to a contract
Listen imma go in
'Til the day that I win
No I won't say it again (I'm a killer, you know)
No one playin' with him
With all of these punches you'll take on the chin
Got 'em wobbly lookin' like you 'bout to fall back
And catch a fatality like Mortal Kombat
I'm keepin' my soul even though they all want that
I never call back when they tell me to

[Verse 3: Skrizzly Adams]
They be tellin' me to sell my soul, I hear those voices all around
Devil on my shoulder but I'll never let him try to pull me down
They be tellin' me to sell my soul, I hear those voices all around
Devil on my shoulder but I'll never let him try to pull me down

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
Why don't you sell your soul? (x4)

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Na na na na, na na na na, na na na na (x5)
