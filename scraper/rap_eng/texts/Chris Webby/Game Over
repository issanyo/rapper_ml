[Kinetics]:
I'm a nutball, I walk in a label and scream, "Fuck y'all"
Fuck a pub deal, I would rather be at a pub crawl
And moreover, a natural born soldier
That'll come to life like that bullet out the Korn poster
See, I was born sober, but know that I'll die twisted
I smoke every five minutes, now both of my eyes squinted
I push a Q45 Infinite, my ride's tinted
Sike, I'm on the F Train with homeless guys in it
C'mon shorty, sky's the limit
I got a brand new Metrocard that still has $2.25 in it
So yo let's hit up a sports bar
Cause after a couple more shot my standards will be almost as low as yours are
Showed this girl named Megan my bunk bed
Slid my balls in-between that slut's legs like a nutmeg
Get it? A "nutmeg," I said her name was Megan
That pun operated on three levels but nobody gets it
I guess I make ya mind snap when I'm on tracks
I'm like the rap version of John Nash but on crack
I used to be an A student, okay stupid?
Now I make great music, and the bitches rage to it
I go to the rave zooted, pop so much E
Even the fat bitch passed out is attractive enough for me
Wakin' up on Saturday without a credit card
I musta lost it last night, but after callin' every bar
We went to of course it is at the random spot that's very far
"Yo, I gotta couple hundreds." Fuck it, that's what friends are for
Sippin' nasty liquor out a plastic pitcher
While I'm throwing singles at the fattest stripper
My producer is a chain smoker, I don't spend a day sober
But as soon as we get our shit together yo it is game over
