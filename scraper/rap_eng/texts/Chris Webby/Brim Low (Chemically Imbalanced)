[Verse 1]
Pulling my fitted right down to my eyes, like a fucking disguise
Thought that I wanted it so I just shot for the sky
Now I don’t even know why
Gave it a try, wanted a piece of the pie, now it’s a fucking surprise
The way that I’m living is different
I’m hitting and missing, and I’m just here trying to vibe
Oh my god, all this shit done changed, people be noticing me
Now they all love me, or hate me
Like there ain’t no in between
I’m doing me, and that’s all I know
Out on the road doing these shows
To give you the fans a little piece of my soul
But you must know I’m just like you when I ain’t got no mic
So if you see me out in public show me respect and we aight
And yes you can have an autograph
But if I’m with a girl or my family and friends
I don’t get that much so please don’t ask
Pick and choose, you respect me as a person, I’ll reciprocate
Tip my hat and give you dap and I will just be on my way
If you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign

[Hook]
I’m just tryna live my life like I’m supposed to be
While I’m following the path that has chosen me
Now it’s everywhere I go people notice me
Feet planted with my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low, and I don’t see no haters
My eyes red, cause I’m always medicated
Now they say I made it, cause I’m elevated
But my feet planted and my head up high
But I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low, I’ma keep my brim low
I’ma keep my brim low with my head up high
And I’ma keep my brim low

[Verse 2]
Always be keeping my hat to my brow
And my head in the clouds
Shit has been stressing me so I been rolling this loud
Trying to block it all out
But I know right now that this here’s my shot
Shit or get off of the pot
Shoot for the top, ain’t no looking back
This is all I got, so I will not stop
But I sacrifice my private life
That’s the shit that drives a person nuts
But I won’t lose sight of that feeling I got way back when
When I started to write
Hit Radio Shack with my dad
Bought me a mic, best day of my life
Ever since then I just make this music
Put it out for them to hate
But I’m Superman, my skin too thick to be penetrated
So many people always been telling me that I never would make it
But I’m an artist, how many times must I demonstrate it?
Now it’s my time to take it, I made my choices
But now so many people in my ear I’m hearing voices
So if you see me while I’m out and got my hat down to my eyes
Brim low, that is like my “please do not disturb” sign
