[Verse One: Chris Webby]
She's the picture of perfection, let's start with that
Type to give an elderly man a heart attack
She's bad, so goddamn sexy
Thinkin' dirty thoughts every single time she texts me
Bedroom hot and heavy, naked and sweaty
Hour after hour, non-stop, stay ready
We both down for whatever, that's why I got you
And you got me, so we rollin' to the top, boo
She's like a top model, and I'm a ill rapper
Down to kick it, roll a blunt and just chill after
Pop a pill after, shit, we're both nuts
Telling us to slow up, and we're like, "So what?"
'Cause we don't give a fuck, and they know it
Throwin' middle fingers up, bitch, blow it
The sex gets rough, I got the scars to show it
But she's the only one I roll with, that's my baby

[Hook: Chris Webby]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll, 'cause Mami gonna ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down until the morning
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita, cita
She my, my mamacita, cita

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]
She like to fuck on the regular, but baby I'm ahead of ya
I've been doing dirty, you tamed a sexual predator
And since, it's hard for me to keep my dick in my pants
I guess this is the chance, for me to find true romance
Mami like 5'2'', dark tan complexion
Nice ass, real tits, with a slim mid-section
I know every dude stays looking at you
But since you're coming home with me there ain't shit I gotta do
You, do, somethin' to me, fuckin' with me
Under the sheets, babygirl's nothin' but freaks
She's five hundred degrees, so hot and spicy
Grab me, scratch me, slap me, bite me
'Cause since she got an attitude, she always wanna fight me
But since I like it rough, we can do it on the nightly
We stay gettin' drunk and fight, but it's aight, yo
It's worth it, the make-up sex is so tight, yeah

[Hook: Chris Webby]
She's the one that I keep to the side of me
Ready to roll, 'cause Mami gonna ride with me
From the moment the sun goes down until the morning
So sexy with every damn thing she do
That's why I can't hold back when I'm bangin' you
She my, she my, my mamacita, cita
She my, my mamacita, cita

[Verse Three: Chris Webby]
She's a dime piece, everybody know her, girly's well known
Sendin' me, naked pictures on a cell phone
Babygirl, I really think that I'm lovin' you
Either that, or shit, I'm addicted to fuckin' you
But it's whatever, we gonna ride 'til the suns up
Hit it harder than nunchuks, makin' you cum, yup
I am one-up on all of the rest
Because I do it like I done her and I did it the best
Sex drive on full throttle, you know what I'm about
What, give a fuck if we wake the people in your house up
Yeah, Mami's so sexual, don't gotta stretch 'cause them legs so flexible
Pop an X pill and just fuck for five hours
From the bed to the floor, and the floor to the shower
Dry off a little then it's back to the bed
'Cause she my Mamacita, yo, you heard what I said?
Holla!
