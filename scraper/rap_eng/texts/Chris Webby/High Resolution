[Intro]
[?]
Couple blunts in a ghost town
We can sit back and watch the waves roll by

[Verse 1]
Yeah, finally the herbs come around
Yeah, I like to twist them up, I like to burn it down
Girl, you were my last nerve fishing around
If i went MIA, I'm probably just rolling loud
Yeah, Connecticut all in my flow, dumbing out for the dough
Figuring figures is all I know
Baby I'm bad at love, but we could try it for sure
I'm so close to getting back what I was owed, yeah
Had to kill it right where I was stationed, the blunt is like my record 'cause it's up in rotation
Ice all in my veins like I'm losing my circulation
Money gotta keep flowing, damn

[Chorus]
Rolling up the fire, yeah we rolling up the fire (ya ya ya)
Fire, yeah we rolling up the fire, fire
Ay, fire, yeah we rolling up the fire (ya ya ya)
Fire, yeah we rolling up the fire, fire
Ay

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Webby, Uh
I just ate an edible, not sure how many grams I had
But now I'm driving slow, paranoid that a cop just ran my tags
"Rook, put that joint out! Stuff that weed in the camera bag, oh, wait, that was just a FedEx van, my bad"
I'm fucking sorry yo, I'm really fucking high
My contacts are dry and they're feeling like pink eye
I'd forgot we in the future where we stay criminalized
Let me chill, let me roll one and blast up into the sky
You see Rook, he shoot to kill with that Sony red when we cruising through
And JP is a known killer on the fruity loops
And Chris Webby? Yo that boy is fucking nuts, say the wrong thing and catch a Raw Thoughts uppercut
Doctor Jekyll double cup, Mr Hyde murder rap
Spent my time coming up, all I gotta earn from that
With my bars harder than a fucking Ninja Turtle's back
Shout to Donatello, "Where the purple at?"

[Chorus]
Rolling up the fire, yeah we rolling up the fire (ya ya ya)
Fire, yeah we rolling up the fire, fire
Ay, fire, yeah we rolling up the fire (ya ya ya)
Fire, yeah we rolling up the fire, fire
Ay

[Outro]
Yeah we roll it, then we light it
Then we hold it, and get in the highest
Yeah we roll it, then we light it
Then we hold it, and get in the highest
Yeah we roll it, then we light it
Then we hold it, and get in the highest
Yeah we roll it, then we light it
Then we hold it, and get in the highest
