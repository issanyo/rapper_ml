[Verse 1]

See I'm eight years deep in the game
I rock shows and drop flows
San Diego to Chicago
Pulling MC's card
Quickest like Cosco
Playing Pokemon GO
Filling the Tahoe
With a couple of Pigeots
Riding through the city blocks
Make 'em Squirtle when I hit the spot
At the Poke Stop
Where you know they sell loud
Crack the Dutchy down the middle
And roll up the Bellsprout
Now I'm hell bound
But I'm moving Slowbro
Sweet fat low pro at the local Sunoco
I’m Loco with it, spit it back at the critics
I buckle down and I flip it
Like catapulting a midget
I’m underground as a Diglett, so fuck around you can get it
Crack a bowl up and hit like back when I was a kid singing Lalalala
I didn’t graduate
I hit the school of hard knocks harder than it can actually take
I cut my circle down to half a space
And I eradicate these Rattata tales from my database
Gene splicing myself with a teen Titan
I say what I mean don’t need no helping or no rewrite
And I’m lighting another bag and spark
Bout to hit a pack for Mark
Chick in my bed, lay on her side like a Magikarp
Cause Webbys on that Magmar, fire with the flow, shit they Know I still got mad bars
The world’s fucked and I’m sick of it dude
Cause uh, the end is near, I can picture it dude
And election time is coming, gotta pick from the two but uh Fuck Donald Trump and fuck Hillary too
And that’s that. Gotta spit it dope this shit is Mandatory
NYC go on and grab a shorty
Webby Wednesday, wild out and crack a 40
We turning Webster Hall into Webbys laboratory
Cause that’s just what it is
I come back, freestyle then I flip for the kids
It’s like that, cause I spit it on a track
And I Chiropract when I snap the back
You know I come through, no one can ever get em
Its C-Webb better known to you as ash Ketchum
I wreck em, I’m on bro, never gonna stop
So try to put me down but I’m back up like John snow, bitch
Yeah
And I caught a Rattata motherfucker
Ya know, it’s pretty common, whatever
I’ll throw on an incense, throw on a lure
Catch a little bit more
Yeah
Cause I’m back up like John snow what the fuck you want bro
