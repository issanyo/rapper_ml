[Chorus]
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Verse 1]
We be hanging with the goblins
Livin' dead, thriller mobbin'
Damn, I'm such a night crawler
Damn, I'm such a night crawler
The boogie man is my weed guy and he swings by with that ganja
I'm running out I might call him
I'm running out I might summon him up
What, runnin' a mock, all when the sun isn't up
Don't want it with us, trust, doubling up
Throwing that bud in the dutch
Keepin' it hush, no you ain't got say shit
I see the moonlight on the skyline and I chase it
Got vitamin-D deprivation, aight
Don't need daylight savings time
Trying to lead a generation
Follow me up into space, and I'm
Using constellation navigation out to my destination
If it gets too dark, use echolocation
Follow my senses on out from the basement
So while you afraid of the dark
Cold heart give 'em goosebumps
R.L. Stein when that moon's up
Nightrider with a tune-up
So who's up? Who's nocturnal like me?
Insomniac in a Pontiac, I don't get no sleep

[Chorus](x2)
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Verse 2]
I might have to make a sacrifice
Witches broom make me levitate
Poison potion 'til my stomach ache
I know it's tainted but I love the taste
Yeah, I can feel it taking over, yeah I can feel it taking over
Whiskey mix in that Cola, like Doctor Jekyll with the soda
Mister Hyde betta hide ya, and no one to help you inside of here
There's something under your bed, I'm coming for you at night yeah
Better sleep with a nightlight and a dream catcher and a crucifix
And a garlic necklace, and an exorcist
With the silver bullets and extended clips
So we never miss, inhale mary, I'm devilish
No spiderman, I'm Eddy Brock, on any block, so venomous
It's treacherous when that moons out, people turning into silhouettes
Shadows moving can't see shit, but that cherry burning on the cigarette
Yeah, mirror mirror on the wall, you can hear me when I call
Moonlight wolf howling, 'cause I'm coming for it all now
Now who's up? Who's nocturnal like me?
Insomniac in a Pontiac, I don't get no sleep

[Chorus]
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way
I don't see no sunshine
All I see is moonlight today
Wake up when the night fall
I just let the stars guide my way

[Outro]
I don't see no sun, I don't see no sunshine
Wake up when it's night, wake up when the nightfall
I don't see no sun, I don't see no sunshine
