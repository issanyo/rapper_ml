[Intro]
Yeah Shit it sucks growing up man
Shit changes
You lose touch with people
You lose friends along the way
But you just gotta keep going man Yeah

[Verse 1]
Man it sucks growing up, gotta let go of the past
Not every childhood friendship is going to last
People grow up and move on, for better or worse
Always praying for us that it doesn't end in a church
We used to go on L rides like the city's ours
But now we all got real jobs and shitty hours, huh
And those the lucky ones who earn a check
The ones who don't sit at home all day and blow percocets
Cause I've seen a lot of people on the path
And it sucks cause they almost never come back
It's the sad truth to life, it's ruthless, right?
As a kid we never thought that we could lose the fight
Shit we all had big dreams back in middle school
But real life is played by different rules
And reality hurts
So I always keep a bag of the purp
And pray for the best until they put my ass in the dirt, word

[Hook]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

[Verse 2]
For the teenage mothers with a baby to feed
For the kids who think the pill bottle's all that they need
We all hit a rough patch, get back on your feet, we only got one life
And it goes on, but now we're one less
NEV tatted on my bicep, shit
Nick I miss ya man, but I guess that fate just had a different plan
I thought you and me would be kicking it in twenty years
Talking bout our wife and kids over a couple beers
And now you're not here
And it's hard to even say in a song
But shit I've thought about you every fuckin' day you've been gone
A.G. Shawn and Glock we all getting through the pain
But just know that Norwalk ain't gon' ever be the same
You even had faith in me back when we was kids
You said I'd get big back when nobody did
So now I'mma do this rap shit for the both of us now
Cause I know your still up there Holding me down
So brother, save me a spot if something happens to me
Until then, enjoy the show from the balcony seats
I love you man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
For the kids who lost friends and family in the past
For the kids who messed up and want to take it all back
We all hit a rough patch get back on your feet. We only got one life
If you got a dream you gotta get it man
At least try, shit, you may never get a second chance
As a kid we never thought that it could happen to you
For better or worse It's how I'm here rapping to you
Keep in touch with all your homies and your right in the prize
We all slip and fall down push your shit to the side
Only got one life better live while you got it
Cause only one thing's for sure: tomorrow is not promised
Yeah

[Hook]
Chances thrown, nothing's free
Longing for what used to be
Still it's hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

[Outro]
And that's it, you know
Life goes on. Got to keep focus
Nicky We all miss ya down here brotha
We'll see you though
Yeah
