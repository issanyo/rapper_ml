[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Gotta let go and set your mind free
Cut loose from the powers that be now
And the people say follow me
Vibrations shape the revolution
Biddy bye-bye, they go-o away
All the problems that show up
See they can't not control us
So just sit back and roll up a J
When things aren't going my way
Keep a hold on my faith to the world to the end of times
I just sit there warp drive on the Enterprise
It's heatin' up and I can feel the pressure rise
No, never, they will not divide us
So we gon' rise up let the vibe set the tone, it's gon guide us
You just gotta get control over what's inside ya
Let the love bless your soul
Swallow your pride get ya vibe and go oh oh

[Chorus: Chris Webby]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear, so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Gotta let go and set your mind free
Gotta stand up for what you believin'
When the time comes you gon' see
Vibrations shape the revolution
Biddy bye-bye to all of my fears, you
Should never look back
Don't get lost in the past
You gotta leave all that behind in the rearview
Now roll those windows down so they hear you
Let me hear you say (Oh, oh, oh)
We gon' never lose the vibe
Now let me hear you say (Oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, we never gonna lose the vibe
We never lose the vibe
Hop on a wave, we can cruise the tidal or choose to fly
So blessed, we can move the sky
And change the world, it starts with just you and I
Yeah, it starts with just you and I

[Chours: Chris Webby]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
And I don't understand why the world so cold, yeah
So I keep on row, headin' down that road
Like it's all I know, I know, I know, I know
And I don't understand why the world so cold, yeah
So I keep on row, headin' down that road
Like it's all I know, I know, I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Justina Valentine]
Lend me your ear, free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
And the skyline's clear so it's about time
Everybody sit back and check the vibe
Wise man, me no need no education
All I do is sit back and check the vibe
So lend me your ear, let me free your mind
You just gotta sit back and check the vibe
