[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
When I get up in the booth, Sap play those beats
Yeah the white boy slick, but I stay low-key
Smart kid, brain sharper than a Mako's teeth
I like my chicks a little dirty and my Jamo neat
Like a woman who don’t got a whole lot to say
With a booty more than half her whole body weight
And when you lookin’ like that, I just gotta taste
So I just put ‘em on a plate like I’m Bobby Flay
Maneuvering, when we doin’ things
Get up in her till I rearrange her NuvaRing
Oh shit, why you even steppin’ to a king?
I’m a vet, you could use a little tutoring
Let me break it down, and you could watch as I do
Make her shut the fuck up, I’ma Papa Doc you
Stayin’ up all night like I’m Nosferatu
All I know is how to kill it and I probably got to, what?

[Bridge: Stacey Michelle]
I need a drag of that Jameson
‘Cause I got the taste you’ve been savoring
Ooh, ah, I got exactly whatchu need
Said ooh ah, I got exactly whatchu need

[Hook: Stacey Michelle] (x4)
(I got whatchu need)
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need

[Verse 2: Sap]
I’m outworkin’ y’all, yeah I said that
Sonnin’ niggas to get on they job like Craig dad
Hoes tryin’ to figure where my head at
I told them mind they business, shorty show me where your bed at
Knock ‘em off quick and I’m back to it
You ain’t talkin’ ‘bout no paper, then I probably turn my back to it
Drop my new shit, watch ‘em snap to it
Said it couldn’t be done, well nigga watch Sap do it
Man you know I stay on track, you can’t hate on that
Cop a foreign, put the American plate on that
She got a ass shot appointment, can’t wait on that
If you want it fatter, I could push some weight on that
I’m that nigga, ho, and I know you heard
Ask around in your town, you don’t really run this shit
Said you need a track from me, what’s the word?
You gon’ need ten racks if you really want a hit, I’m the shit

[Bridge: Stacey Michelle]
I need a drag of that Jameson
‘Cause I got the taste you’ve been savoring
Ooh, ah, I got exactly whatchu need
Said ooh ah, I got exactly whatchu need

[Hook: Stacey Michelle] (x4)
(I got whatchu need)
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need

[Outro: Stacey Michelle]
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
I got whatchu need, I got whatchu need
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)
(I got whatchu need)
