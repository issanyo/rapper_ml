[Hook]
Some people say I'm famous, tell me that I made it
Some other people never heard of me at all
Got some people on my dick now, others talking shit now
I'm just in the middle trying to write these songs
So I can make some paper, yeah that would be great sir
I've been doing this shit way too long
Bout to get my just dues, don't like it then fuck you
I'm just doing me, you can all fuck off

[Verse 1]
Check my lyrics up on Rap Genius, I'm a rap genius
Going longer than a fully gassed Prius, bitch I mean it
I've been at this shit for years now, where my millions at, Regis?
Got the wheel in my grip, I'm surpassing you backseaters
Til I'm sipping margaritas off the coast of Ibiza
With a bowl full of reefer, eyes low as Khalifa's
And got two lovely senoritas making home-cooked pizza
And anything we need I throw on the Visa, I'm getting there!
Shit this game ain't overnight, at least it wasn't for me
But now I'm varsity and I'm filling the bleachers
Drop a track and now these DJ's bring it back
Just like a golden retriever
Get on the mic and spit your dopest shit, I know the procedure
Yeah, some people got my lyrics tatted on they skin
Some people read every single Tweet that I send
Some other people still be like "who is he?"
But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm staying high as Buzz Aldrin
Major Tom can hear me coughing
I'm falling out of gravity ("someone help, I think we lost him")
Hit the stage and show these people how I do this shit so often
Got em yelling like they're Paul Revere on horseback outta Boston
You critics can't deny it, shut your mouth and keep it quiet
Now I'm out here getting bread, you'd think I'm on a Subway diet
I do this shit the livest, so yo please don't kill my vibe, bitch
Or I'm setting off a riot in this bitch, don't even try it
I've been working everyday, I think I need a vacation
And your girl been feeling me just like a TSA agent
So even if you haven't heard of me, at least she did
And even though that pisses you off, don't blame me kid!
Some people hate the fact that now I'm on my way
Some people love every fucking word that I say
Some other people still be like "who is he?"
But fuck it man, I'ma keep doing me cause
