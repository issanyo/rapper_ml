You can catch me on the dubstep
Rough neck of the woods
While I leave them haters upset
Bust it cause I could
Got your girl obsessed
Rough sex on the hood
Of my piece of shit vehicle
Yes I'm that good
Shit I'm smoother than the scalp of Mr. Clean
Sipping Hennessy and Listerine
With a pound of sticky from the Philippines
Chris is mean, too heavy for triple beams
Kid, I'm Freddy Krueger with a fitted on up in your bitch's dreams
I know you heard me
Knowing I'm clever and worthy
Baby I'm wordy
Ha, Emeril Lagasse couldn't serve me
Bitch I'm dirty
Like the air quality in Jersey
So just cop another 30
Let's get sloppy if you heard me
I'm the number one white rapper under Mr. Mathers
Just kicking bad words, leaving nobody standing after
I'm a bastard, I swing with a lightsaber, Jedi Master
Then crack the asskicking 'til I knock your ass backwards
Faster, than Lamborghinis pedal to the floor
Come and step to Web cause I can settle any score
One and a half rounds and you will exit out the door
Taking hits to the chest out of a triple chamber ROOR
Girl on all fours, hit it like a champ
Do it doggy style, Lady and the Tramp
I do it to the fullest never takin' any chance
Rocking rubber and making these bitches evacuate their pants
I'm the next to fucking blow, I don't know why you would doubt me
What you know about me I'll sit here and rap until I'm drowsy
I'm the shit like Mr. Hankey, smoke more reefer than Towelie
Then kill a beat like Kenny when Webby be getting rowdy
I'm nice and I say it proudly, aiming for the top
And if someone else is there then I'll be taking up their spot
I blaze a lotta pot, get lifted and just melt
Like the cheddar in a grilled cheese, cook it up myself
Yes I got the champ belt of these caucasian college artists
I'm the hardest white or black cause I can slaughter them regardless
Step in with my eyes red, listen to what I said
Bigger than Baloo the bear balancing on his hind legs
Lighting up the piff while I'm taking a piss
In a cup for probation with a blunt still lit
I'm the best, not a chance for second guessing
Think you're better? Dream on, you're about to reach Inception
Rapping it great, back in the race
Anywhere I go, go and catch me a case
Cause I beat up flows and won't never leave a trace
When I uppercut vocals and kick the bass
Stop, drop and roll around
I'm the king and I hold the crown
I got the dopest sound
Probation sober now
Go light speed then slow it down
Roll a pound, light it up
Come and throw down, man try your luck
Grab me a lighter, fire it up
Ripping the bong 'til I'm high as fuck
Sag my pants, grab my nuts
Rappin just to make a buck
Throw my middle fingers up
This troublemaker don't give a fuck
I'm a vet but I don't check a dog's heartbeat
I just emerge the winner when somebody starts beef
Hardly any facial hair, so everybody cards me
Still they try to bite me like Charlie, Barney
Rumble with a Betty up in the passenger car seat
Webby spit it as heavy as ever, somebody charge me
Assault and battery of the beat and I'm not sorry
This is what I do, baby I'm just here to party
I rap fat, make these bitches backtrack
When I ice my competition no Smirnoff in the backpack
Always have the last laugh, chuckle to myself
And that's word to the Ninja Turtle buckle on my belt
I've got that True Blood, call me Bill Compton
I got that good weed, call me Nancy Botwin
I'm a super villain, call me the Green Goblin
But whatever you call me just know I get it popping
I need to be left alone my title has been set in stone
Drinking Jack Daniels popping Ambien and Prednisone
Italiano, they tellin' me I'm the next Capone
Slinging sticks and stones to be sure that I'm breaking every bone
It's that dude Christian stay sick, flu spitting
So if you stepping to me, check your immune system
Everything that I be saying is hard
It's part 2, and it's Webby, I'm still raising the bar
