[Hook: Chris Webby]
There's a lot of people talking to me, I don't hear nothin'
Pop a pill now I'm rollin', all I hear is the percussion
I'm gone (x5)
Driftin to another world, losing touch with gravity
Losing touch with everything, even my own reality
I'm gone (x7)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Got my unusual pharmaceuticals, everyone is edible
Barely sensible, but I'm feelin' fuckin' incredible
Like Bruce Banner changin' the standard of bein' lifted
Got another dutchy twisted the size of a fuckin' midget
I rhyme and they fuckin wit' it, so why would I fuckin' quit it?
So I'll tap my blunt ashes on these liars and fuckin' critics
Designed to just be a menace, let me pop a pill and witness
Me defy the laws of physics, tell Newton I really did it
No losin' so let me get it, maneuverin' with the quickness
I'm the reason that my local pharmacy is still in business
I'm the illest like I stepped out the clinic with bad news
Now they see me as more than just a gimmick with tattoos
They hatin' then fuck you, and fuck it yo where's my medicine?
I think I got another doctor's appointment to pencil in
Almost out of Adderall, pop another Ambien
Buckled in on whatever shuttle they try to land me in

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'll be poppin' G-ladies until I'm at least eighty
Unable to see straightly wherever the E takes me
I'm there, poppin' stars until I'm rollin' insane
Even if the doctor says I'll get a hole in my brain
I got that mental Novocaine, palms sweaty, it's aight though
Molly and some acid tabs, yep! that is the right dose
I'm bad news, you want different? then go to Geico
A drug induced animal posted up with the lights low
Brim to my eyebrows, higher than the sky's clouds
I'm Mike Vick-ing bitches refusing to lie down
Greater than Alexander, searchin' for my crown
Ounces don't do it no more, I gotta buy pounds
Break it down, then I roll it up quick and I light that shit
Ain't nobody messin' with the flow now, betta slow down
You ain't rippin' mics like this
You don't live a life like this, so go and shut your lips
And pass the fuckin' joint man, I need another hit

[Hook]
