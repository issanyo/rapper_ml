[Intro]
Yeah, the planet's fucked up man
Human beings are the worst thing that happened
To this whole Mother Earth baby
This is what it is, uh

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
The world we're livin' in, this shit is messed up
Sometimes it feels like God packed up and left us
Terrorist killin' people for no reason
The good die young, while evil's still breathin'
I can't even turn the news on
All you hear about is dangerous people creatin' new bombs
Serial killers and natural disasters
I'm just prayin' they'll be some pieces to put together after
Oil spills after Hurricane Katrina
Kim Jong-il sendin' threats from North Korea
The middle east, war on the streets
People strappin' bombs cause of their religious beliefs
Killin' others by the dozen
As the human race falls victim to our own self destruction
We gotta change the way we live
Cause it's the same fucked up world that I'll be leavin' to my kids
Man

How the fuck am I supposed to raise a family here, man?
How can I leave what we got, give it to my kids like... crazy
Sometimes it's nothin' but bad people
Nothin' but bad things goin' on, ah?
Fuck... What can I do, you know? What can I do?

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We gotta make a change, it's our duty
We're rapin' the planet of it's resources and beauty
Gangs kill each other on American soil
While we destroy entire ecosystems drillin' for oil
I know times change, and shit evolves
But I remember forests and now the mini malls
Mother Earth been givin' us a warnin'
What happens when the ice caps melt from global warmin'?
Some of the most majestic creatures on this planet
Are hunted till the point the population's nearly vanished
Gunned down for recreational activity
And now can only be found at zoos and captivity
We've just become too technologically advanced
At this rate, the earth never stood a chance
The Mayans say our time is almost done
So if 2012 is true I guess we had a good run
Right?

Yeah, 2012 man it's comin'
Whatever your opinion is, we fucked
We got oil spillin' on the Gulf Coast
Deforestation in South America man, read about it man, fuck

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm not tryin' to seem to pessimistic
But if things don't change that outcome is realistic
And everyone should be aware of all this shit
As the world spins on it's axis like a kick flip
They say I poorly influence all of these kids
Cause honestly they shouldn't idolize the crazy way I live
But I don't want 'em makin' the same mistakes I did
That will lead 'em to a life full of nothin' but shit
Cause it's not cool to pop mad pills and act crazy
But I got my own demons, my own Slim Shady
That alter ego always up to nothin' but trouble
But I left all that behind me when I stepped out of the rubble
And try to get my life together followin' this rap shit
When I say it's all I got, I mean it, that's it
It's the way nobody stoppin' me from makin' it
And if it's not given to me, then I'm takin' it

I'm here baby, you know
I'm always on my party shit, La la la, Off The Chain
Whatever man,I'm an intelligent person, I know what's good
Go out, read the newspaper, see what's goin' on around you man
People too stupid, educate yourselves
