[Intro]
You motherfuckers, I hate you
I hate all you fucking assholes
So fucking pissed off right now
Yeah yeah temper, temper, calm down Webby...

[Verse 1]
Some of these websites won't post me cause I rep for the burbs
Without even spinnin' my record or inspectin' my words
But while these bloggers underestimate my level of skill
I’ma shove this shit in their faces when I settle a deal
No fuck that, I'll shove it in their faces now
Cause I’m unsigned makin' a couple thou for rappin' in front of crowds
But because of where I'm from these dudes don't take me serious
And make assessments in seconds before they here me spit
Can you tell I'm pissed? well spectacular
Webby's a cold blooded prick, a young Dracula
To shatter your clavicle bone, tie you up and drag ya
From the back of an Acura then set you up in the passenger seat
Belt buckle you in and then poor gas
All over your squirmin' body, drop a Zippo on your lap
Cock my head back laughin' maniacally,  take that bitch
Throw a match in the gas tank, blow you to fragments
Come back with a dust pan and sweep up all your ashes
And sprinkle em' on the toilet paper I'll wipe my ass with
I got the craziest rap tactics
Smokin' crack till I black out and wreak havoc
On women and children, I like elderly too
Anybody who's not a subscriber to my YouTube
Gon' get it, so if you don’t like what I do
Suck my motherfuckin' dick until your face turns blue

[Hook]
They like temper, temper calm down Webby
Take it down a notch, the world’s not ready
Let em talk shit they ain’t steppin to you
They just mad of what you’re destined to do
They like temper, temper calm down Webby
Take a chill pill man, the world’s not ready
They mad at you for doin' everything that you do
So piss me off and I will hate to be you

[Verse 2]
I know my attitude can get pissy every so often
But there’s so many dudes in this world that's pissin' me off and
I should shut my mouth, just smile back and keep on walkin'
But I’ve kept my temper cool to the point it's causin' exhaustion
My dude Apathy told me to relax and just spit these
Bars, and ignore all these fuckin' faggots who diss me
Who use my name in the hopes that I lose my cool and diss back
And they'll get buzz by me puttin' the name in the track
So I zip it and continue on my promisin' path, makin' cash
So while they're runnin' their mouth, I just gotta laugh
Sit back, cop some dope from a groupie and just relax
Even though deep in my soul I wanna go get me an axe
Run up on their doorstep lookin' like a lumberjack
Swing and slash till you couldn't I.D. the dude I attacked
But shit I've been to jail once and I’m not tryin' to go back
So I let it simmer in my brain until my skull cracks
Say to myself, temper temper Webby, turn it down a notch
Then the devil on my shoulder says to go walk down the block
Find a shit talker, drag him to the highest mountain top
Give him a parachute with a hole in it throw him down and watch
Him hit the ground, splatter all over the fuckin' pavement
Stand over what’s left of him yellin' out "now say shit"
I know I’m a deranged headcase
But it’s my temper, I need anger management to help contain me
Like

[Hook]

[Outro]
You mother fuckers
I'll fuckin, I'll kick you in the god damn shins and make you run a lap
Fuckin' scrape your taste buds out and feed you the best meal you ever had
You won't be even able to taste it
I'll uh, scrape your eyes out and put on the Shawshank Redemption
It's a great movie and you're gonna miss it cause you're blind
Assholes
