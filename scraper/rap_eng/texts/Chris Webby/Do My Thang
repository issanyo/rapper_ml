Ah ha ha, Webby
Time to go get 'em

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I don't care what none of you say
I'mma do shit my way
Been here for a minute and I'm here to stay
Cause I'm just gonna do my thang
Made myself a name all by myself
Fuck a record label, I don't need no help
Actually I do because I'm broke as hell
But I'm just gonna do my thang

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a suburban white rapper but I make it work
And now I'm comin' out the blue like a baby Smurf
And yes I blaze the Purp, put that L in rotation
And I'll be doin' that till I catch probation
Stop yo hatin', I'm just here lampin'
Spittin' intense but I'm not going campin'
Soon to be the champion, steadily advancin'
Run the fuckin' beat till I'm crampin'
Dancin' around everybody Cause you know that Webby got 'em
Rollin' deeper than Bikini Bottom pick 'em up and drop 'em
I'mma Kamikaze drivin' blowin' up in terms of rhymin'
Hit em' so hard that nobody could revive 'em
Rappin' louder than a siren when I show up in the ambulance
They gone scrape you off the floor, man you'd never stand a chance
Climb that hill like an ant, top speed accelerate
But the top ain't enough for me I'll always elevate
Smokin' that celery, I'm the best flowin'
Leave your chick knocked up call me Seth Rogen
Back Round Two, I done killed 'em with the White Noise
MJ's dead now we need another white boy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I run the game like the banker in Monopoly
Ain't no one on top of me, except the chick sayin' "put your cock in me"
I'm cocky And I'm probably the illest, no modesty
If Em ain't the nicest white boy, then I gotta be
And I don't need a gun, never let the cannon shoot
Jumpin' over mothafuckers, call me Crash Bandicoot
And it's true, I'll knock you outta your socks and your boots
Eat you like an animal, I'll put 'em in a sandwich dude
Damage you when I put it on wax man
A dirty mothafucker, I just hopped out the trash can
And pussy?, I'm gettin' that fam
My dick's been in more holes than my brain's got in a CAT Scan
And battle me son? you don't really want it
Comin' back with my shield or I'm coming back on it
A Spartan to the heart, I will knock you unconscious
Flyer than a pilot, but no relation to Pontius
A toxic avenger, Into the Twilight Zone bro and I'm comin' back never
Music's runnin' through my veins
Webby is a beast and I do my thang

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Webby]

I am who I am and nobody can change it
And I'll keep doin' me till I get myself famous
A pocket full of change for the day I am anxious
And make myself money off a mastery of language
The portrait's been painted
So bitch, better back off
Pick up the mic and kill it because I'm that raw
And the next person to compare me to Ash Roth
Is getting every feature on their fuckin' face smacked off

[Hook X2]
