[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Ever since I came into the world back in '88
Had anxious brain waves with a baby face
Up in my crib I just laid awake, 'fore I could say my shapes
I was immersed in this crazy place
And uh, me and normal ain't compatible
I am from another universe so come and tag along
Yeah, I wasn't like the other kids up in my class at all
Doctor sayin', "Somethings wrong with him, give him Adderall"
Save me, this shit done made me crazy
Had ADHD and a case of rabies
Shit, I kept my grades up but my brain was spacey
Had to chase me, my legs never stayed in place see
I couldn't pay attention to what's in front of my face
Always in detention for something I shouldn't say
But hey, my mom said that I should speak my mind
And in time, intertwine, with this gift of rhyme
And as fate would have it
I just chased the rabbit down the hole, don't know if I'll make it back
I cheers with the Mad Hatter and blaze with Alice
Practicing black magic and taking acid
With the Cheshire Cat sitting shotgun
Maybe Goose to my Top Gun, wildin out until the cops come
Weirdo til I drop son, normal human I am not one
Yeah

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
And I mean, I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Yeah, what's the difference between me and you?
Shit, I don't think like other people do
Shining like a holographic Pikachu
They said I'd never see it through
But now they got they face in they palm like playing Peek-a-Boo
Unbelievable, inconceivable, they not
I be seein' through, what they feedin' you, brainwash
'Cause an adolescent who's bad at lessons and not accepted
(Find another seat loser) Alrighty guys, I got the message
A little passive but aggressive in the same sense
Then found my passion and rapping ain't been the same since
1/8 lit in my space ship when I day trip
Put the joint to the flame tip
Said I'm hard to ignore, people tell me I'm a lot to absorb
I come around and all the normal people locking they doors
But ever since I was a board and grill mopping them floors
I knew one day they'd see me on the top of the Forbes

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
I mean I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it

[Bridge: Justina Valentine]
I don't care, they don't understand it
This my world, forget the whole planet
Follow me now, follow me now
And I don't care, you don't understand it
This my world, forget the whole planet
Follow me now, follow me now

[Chorus: Justina Valentine]
I don't give a damn what people say about me
(Baby can't you tell)
All of the jokes that the cool kids used to make about me
(Go fuck yourself!)
And I don't care if they are staring at me
Pretty soon they'll follow everywhere that I be, that I be
I mean I'm just a weirdo, yes, it appears so
Don't follow the leader, it's not my demeanor
That's not what I'm here for
'Cause I'm just a weirdo, isn't it clear though
I’m on my own planet and damn it
Don't care if you don't understand it
