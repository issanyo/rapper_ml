[Verse One: Chris Webby]
I'ma outdo you, don't know what I do to
You, bitch I'm cuckoo
Only white boy at private school, rockin' FUBU's
Spittin' flames like a dragon, homie, call me Mushu
Like Yogi, leave you with a Boo Boo, from punches and kicks
You'll catch a pummelin', now tell me, who's fuckin' with this?
I'm runnin' this shit, with my troublesome clique
Won't stop 'til I'm drownin' in a puddle of spit
Pussy tends to come my way, call me catnip
A fuckin' bull mastiff, hit 'em with a kick, make 'em backflip
This is madness, drunk and chuggin' a forty
Writing in my notebook, but this isn't a love story
Grimier than Nori, but I stay with cream
Leaving you lost, like Oceanic Flight 815
Real mean, when I get up on the mic and shred it
No copy, paste or edit, I'm nice, so don't sweat it

[Hook: Vice Versa]
And you know that I'm a rider, boy
So try the boy
He'll spit flames and fire, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches
And you know I'm spittin' fire, boy
Retire boy
Cause I'm a level higher, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches

[Verse Two: Chris Webby]
I make a point like Uncle Sam, stay puffin' grams
Drunk as fuck, with my red solo cup in hand
You better fuckin' scram, cause I am back, bitch
'Bout to be blowin' up like an inflatable mattress
Not one to mess with, cleaner than anti-septic
Check it, before this verbal Tec make your chest lit
I'm blessed, A+, five stars, with a check, bitch
Something like Borat - cause you will never get this
Yes, it's vindictive, always blazin' an herb
Pockets full of more trees than a nature reserve
Oh, word? The illest in the 203rd
So fuck what you heard, I'm kickin' 'em to the curb
With words illy, cause everything I write, you felt
Until I'm rockin' a gold metal like Michael Phelps
I'ma keep swimming laps around you, raps around you
Outdo you in things that I don't even know how to

[Hook: Vice Versa]
And you know that I'm a rider, boy
So try the boy
He'll spit flames and fire, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches
And you know I'm spittin' fire, boy
Retire boy
Cause I'm a level higher, boy, so hey
I'ma outdo you, bitches, I'ma outdo you, bitches

[Outro: Vice Versa (Chris Webby)]
Cause I'm doin' my thing, doin' my thing
I'm comin' back around like a boomerang
You know, you know
(You already know)
That I'm the one, y'all can't touch
Never stop rappin' 'til I'm rockin' handcuffs
('Til I'm locked up!)
You know, I'm dope
(I'm dope as a motherfucker)
And I'm holdin' it down, holdin' it down
(Holdin' it down!)
First rapper reppin' a suburban town
(Suburbs!)
Oh
Bitch, oh
Don't got no gun, but you gotta run
Steppin' to me, you're gonna get outdone
You know
(Cause I'm nice and you motherfuckers know, baby!)
