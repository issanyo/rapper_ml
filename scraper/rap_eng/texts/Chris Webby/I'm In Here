Chorus:
I'm in here, can anybody save me?
You can't see me
I'm in here, can anybody save me?

Verse 1: Chris Webby
I don't need your help bitch
I already got the competition sweating
Missed out on the freshman class, cause i was sitting in detention
So let that be a lesson, cause my skill is in the question
But i still remain on time at this point it's like a blessing
I got my GPS, i'm headed in the right direction
So i'll sit here reeking havoc till i have all your attention
Now hop yourself a focal-in maybe try to focus in
I'm doper than most of them, so allow yourself to soak it in
Take a hit of this music and then you hold it in your lungs
Until you feel what i was feeling when i wrote it
Then you'll realise i be spitting colder than a polar win
Undefeated, you bitches can't even hope to win

Chorus:
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?

Verse 2: Killa Kyleon
Realest rapper in it, I'll accept a nomination
If it's not about the dollar, I reject the conversation
The competition zero, stupid dope with your day job
Boys can't see me out, they pupils' on Ray Charles
Only one close is the man in the mirror
I only feel threatened when I stand in the mirror
Hear your voice bumping, talking ain't a context spoke
That's why my dick where you bitch gonna go
I make her bow until she blow a bro up
Running through the screen, they gonna have to pull you up
Centre of attention, they gonna have to pull y'all whack
Cause I'm the only rocket rocking and no you shall not

Chorus:
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?

Verse 3:Chris Webby
I'm the front runner on these up comers on the mike
Better duck under something, worry bout the strikes
See they label me with Miller and Yella because I'm white
But your colour ain't a factor, when you're lyrically precise
Being nice is more than having a dope 16
That you spit at every party and think that your flow is mean
Bring in all your boys and I'll battle your whole team
You don't know shit about rhyming son you way out of league
First I had determination then I earned myself a name in rap
Blazing tracks, swiftly acquired a reputation
Stepped over the segregation and constantly kept it patient
Now I'm aiming for the top or whatever's up for the taking

Chorus:
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me, save me?
I'm in here, can anybody save me?
