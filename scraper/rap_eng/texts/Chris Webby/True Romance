[Intro]
I can’t tell if I love you baby

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay

[Verse 1]
You drive me nuts with that catnip girl
Lay you down on that mattress girl
Saw that ass and I knew I had to have it girl
Quit playin’ games, you ain’t Katniss, girl
Sex until it’s early like you just ain’t got no worries
You and me out on the run, you my Alabama Worley
I’m gettin’ a rubber and then I’ma fuck her
From what I’ve heard I’m a hell of a lover
A bit of a dog I guess, ay
Shout out to all of my eskimo brothers I’m showin’ you what I discovered in yoga
Hittin’ that pussy in lots of ways
Downward dog and turn you over, till you screamin’, “Namaste”

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay

[Verse 2]
It’s that true romance I, feel like I’m so damn high
Rub my fingers down yo’ spine and grab you by yo’ tan lines
I got a dirty mind, I can’t clean it up
Listen girl, you just really gotta teach me what you really want
So I know how to beat it up
No need to be shy with the freaky stuff
Baby I don’t want the key to your heart
I want you up in the back seat of my car
I’m not like all guys that you meet at the bar
Come to my world you’ll be back by tomorrow
Singin', “Aw, nah, hell nah, y’all been up and gunnin’ now”
And I don’t gotta be your boyfriend, let’s just fuck around because

[Hook]
I can’t tell if I love you baby
I don’t know if I should take that chance
‘Cause even though you drive me crazy
I can’t seem to stay out of yo’ pants
So you could be my lady
And I’ma be yo’ tramp
Yeah you out on the run
Intoxicated by the true romance, that true romance, ay
Faded off that true romance, that true romance, ay
So high from the true romance, that true romance, ay
Been on that true romance, that true romance, ay
