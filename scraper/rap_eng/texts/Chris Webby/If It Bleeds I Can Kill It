My Mother said I need tons of med's, I'm fucked in the head
I'm the monster in your closet or under the bed
I'm a psycho!
I thought that you knew!
Mother... Fucker, I'm talking to you!
I ain't holding back, back
Full speed, trillin'!
If it bleeds I can kill it, if it bleeds I can kill it!
I ain't holding back, back
Full speed, trillin'!
If it bleeds, if it, if it, if it
Bleeds, I can kill it!

[Verse 1: Danimal Lector]
I went from, nothing to something in no time
Couple dope rhymes, all of a sudden
First and inches, Sitting on the goal line!
You know I'll shine, gotta go for mine!
I'll never surrender, I'm ready as ever!
You'll never hear anything better than me and Webby together!
Deadly and clever!
Your head'll be severed, forever and ever!
Left to be forgotten, and
You stepping to me is an option but
You'll rest in pieces rotten and
I'm definitely a problem cause
Allegedly I'm a goblin!
Scarred and big
Hard as shit
Bitch, next to me your cotton!
Let me in!
Ya hear me knocking?
Or I'm kickin' it down!
With spittin' I found a different sound!
Ripping the crowd
Big dick
That's why I'm limping around!
I'm flipping the pounds
52 flat!
Call me Ray Lewis!
Hey doofus: I'm the reason why your girl stays stupid!
Heh, coppin' brain!
Burning exotic strains
About to make ten mil off this pocket change!
We'll see what happens
Hear who's laughin'
Bet it's me!
Best defined, you're dead in 3!
Bitch you get what you see

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
My mind is as dark as a rainy day
I'm creating thunder
So any village I stumble upon, I rape and plunder
Now where the haters at?
Line 'em up
Take a number
Cause we ain't playing games, bitch
This isn't Dave and Busters!
We the henchmen
You'll never forget to mention
Got a Hemmy for an engine
So let me get to dissecting
These motherfuckers like frogs in biology
Probably
Fuck getting brain from these bitches
I'd rather give them a lobotomy!
Honestly I'm a psycho
With a history of violence
Rip your heart out of your chest while it's beating
Like ancient Mayans!
So wild, you'd be fucking crying!
We rhymin' and puffin' iron
Big as fuck but I lost my mind
Like I'm grinding on Shutter Island
No Di Caprio, just decapitating and smacking hoes
Take a wooden bat to your face
With the force of DiMagio
Cause we the illest
Smelling blood from further away than a fucking tiger shark, bitch
And if it bleeds I can kill Em!
