[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I keep it so chilly, really, see we stay killing it
Cue the theme music, I'm here on my super villain shit
Here to steal your women and hit it more than a little bit
So ladies grab your clitoris, Webby back up in this bitch
My women look like princesses, I got a job at Disney
Made Jasmin leave Aladdin, now I'm getting sloppy quickies
Cinderella's at the tellie and she drop it quickly
Ariel be sucking my dick when she under water with me
Yeah yeah, so let me grab my scuba tank
Stay faded, lighting up that uber stank
Outrageous, yeah you know I do my thing
DJ's bring my records back like they throwing boomerangs
Still I'm not a Freshman up on XXL
But fuck it, cuz me and Trel are more happy being expelled
We them bad motherfuckers smoking bogies during gym class
Dropouts, who got your girl's pants dropping quick fast

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Ride around town with the speakers up
The smell is coming from the tree we puff
And we so goddamn cold when they speak to us
Got these little hoes freezing up
We keep it so chilly (na na na na na)
So motherfucking chilly (na na na na na)
Everybody rocking with me (na na na na na)
So damn chilly (na na na na na)

[Verse 2: Fat Trel]
I see three pretty bitches out the corner of my eye
Spring, but a chilly day outside
They run around my way to get themselves into shape
My Desert Eagle and my K outside
Now usually when I'm cooling with two white freaks
I like to fly and lay the pipe on the beach
But today's downtown, tinted window, blowing loud
We finna see what she like in the Gleesh
In Connecticut my college bitch got proper etiquette
Bands and good pussy, but the head come better with
I be trying to focus while I'm stroking it raw
But she too busy plotting on the dollars, some hoes
I was busy blowing something stronger than hope
Trash cans for the liquor bottles and Trojans
Webby in the Chevy like the shit ain't stolen
I'm ready, if you ready we can get it to go
So let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
See we keeps it so motherfucking frigid
A Fahrenheit digits
So cold that the wheels on your vehicle skidded
Causing ice on the roads, better go the speed limit
And turn them defrosters on when we spit it
Eyes bloodshot, got me pulling down my fitted
Stay lifted, you would think that I was practicing Quidditch
Put a charm spell right on these bitches before I hit it
Got Hermione on my magic stick, baby come and get it
I just killed another bottle
And took another pill, now I'm going full throttle
Keep hating, Hakuna Matata's my motto
I brush em off like a paleontologist with a fossil
Call me young brothel, you're fucked if you step
Bitch I'm chilly, you could feel them goosebumps on your neck
A++, when I come it's correct
With a chick on my lap, in the tub getting wet

[Hook]
