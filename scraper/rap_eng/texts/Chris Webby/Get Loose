Statik on the beat

[Verse 1]
It's that human dictionary, Webby's always rapping A to Z
Never smart to play with me
The flow is never rated G
My style is indescribable so nobody can label me
Get loose with a bottle of goose
Rollin' an eighth of weed
Step to me, then I'm prepared for war
Cause I'm a ninja, so you know I'm down to carry a sword
In the lead so my competitors stare at the score
While I'll be gettin' high like Chewbacca and Harrison Ford
Immature, yeah, sure, but I spit that heat
Molten lava off the top, baby, Dante's peak
I just tighten up my sneaks and I stomp that beat
Bill the butcher don't even know if you want that beef
I get loose like the crotch of my jeans
So complex when I rap, can't even tell what a lot of it means
But I be gettin' to the top by any possible means
With that audio crack rock I got for the fiend

[Hook]
I get loose in the booth and I'm at it again
So get ready for the show baby, gather your friends
It's that foul mouth white boy back to offend
Everybody that I can, where's my pad and a pen?
I get loose with the flow, never air to my words
CT on my back and I'm reppin' for sure
Anybody and everybody can tell it's my turn
So I'm a show these people why Webby's the best in the burbs

[Verse 2]
I roll the dice like Jumanji, no Robin Williams
But I'll have a pack of animals stampeding through your lobby
I'm the son of Zeus, Webby spit it godly
I'm a good fella, play the role of Tommy
With a couple of Xanies in my system and a klonny
I'll be wallin' out of control, I fuckin' dare you to stop me
I'm edgier than complicated origami
Throwin' fists, I'm the opposite of Gandhi
Never be wack, ahead of the pack, I'm leveling tracks
Et cetera, you step in the ring I'm sending you back
You'll be lucky if you leave and then your head is attached
When I attack the nervous system with these venemous tracks
Stay loose like the laces on my boots
Living proof that hip-hop ain't dead
It evolved to something new
So call the army and bring out the damn tanks
Cause that's all she wrote, Diary of Anne Frank

[Hook]
