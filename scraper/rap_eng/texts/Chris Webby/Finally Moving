[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah
Pretty lights
I'm just tryna do me, you know
Everybody tells me to do this, do that
But I just keep it moving, you know

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
The life I was living is now finally moving
Tryna map out my movements, make a new blueprint
But I got a good feeling now
Touch down, feet leaving the ground, hit 'em with sound
Tryna figure out where my life is headed
Fortune and fame's a step away so I gotta get it
Hope I don't regret it, but I guess we'll see
In the industry tryna do me
C (See) H to the R I S
Gotta try hard I guess
With every bar I let, outta my mouth
I got people to impress
Tryna stay true to me
But at the end of the day I need a check
I can't live at my parents house forever
Broke as fuck, life could be so much better
Everybody tells me that I'm talented and clever
But I still got nothing to show for my endeavors
This is what I live, this is what I breathe
Without hip-hop, there'd be no me
I may have no budget, but fuck it
I don't do it for that, I do it cause I love it
Tryna get the game wrapped up man
It's all I got, no backup plan
These other kids do it for the iTunes cash
I give it to you for free, it's all love like that
And anybody running they mouth saying they nicer
Will shut the fuck up when they step into my Cypher
Dope word writer
On point like the bullet of a sniper
Future looks brighter, still got work to do
Everyday's a grind
Yesterday was theirs, but today is mine
So every time I lay a rhyme, I know this is what I'm meant for, shit'll be fine

[Hook- Chris Webby & Pretty Lights]
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling
Yeah, I got a good feeling, you know
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
I don't think I ever felt it, but uh
I get a good feeling, yeah
Shit's gonna start going good, you know
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I'm feeling good, what can I say
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
Oh no, I get a good feeling yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling
For real, I'm feeling lovely
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling

[Verse 2 - Chris Webby]
Yeah yeah
I know that today is my time
But there's a million other people that's on the same grind
So I gotta separate myself as the best
I gotta hip-hop beat to the heart in my chest
My lungs breathe music, my veins pump melody
That's why I'm so on point mentally
No one is ahead of me, so I know eventually I'll make it
Even if it's not 'till I'm seventy
Rapped for a century, determined to spit
And everything I got in my pocket I'm earning it bitch
It's been a long hard road just to get where I'm at
Court case and some other bullshit don't match
The stress that I feel you don't know about that
Until I tell it to you through all these eloquent raps
Im telling the facts, you don't know Webby like that
I'mma fuck up and drop out with a felony rap
And though I'm not proud let's get that clear
But I've been through a lot of shit
I'm still here, yes I'm still here
Been pedaling for a minute, now it's time to switch gears
Clear skies ahead, I'm an artist to my roots with every god damn line I said
Cruising, and all this will all be worth it dude
Now relax, cause we finally moving like

[Hook - Chris Webby & Pretty Lights]
Ooh, sometimes I get a good feeling
Get a feeling, that I never never never never had before
I get a good feeling, yeah
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling
Just wanna tell you right now
I get a good feeling
