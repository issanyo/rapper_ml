Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Jurassic Park"

[Hook]
Tell em all like (ha ha ha)
You don't really want it with a guy like me
Na-na-na (ha ha ha)
Your jacket ain't got no stripes like me
Na-na-na (ha ha ha)
You ain't about that life, you don't have that heart
When the cages unlock in Jurassic Park
You might not make it, better play your part
Cause I be like (ha ha ha) [4x]
You might not make it, better play your part
Cause I be like

[Verse 1]
Reptilian from the Cretaceous
I've written the pages of how to make music
From minimum wages to killing these stages
I honestly offer the children a blueprint
How to do this shit, how to do that shit
How to crash Datpiff, how to be in tune with
All of my fans from all over the atlas
You don't respect that then I'ma lose it
See I've been around since the comet crashed
With the velociraptors, no way that I'll give in yet
And that's why I'm feeling myself just like Pee-wee Herman in the back of a cineplex
I've watched other rappers catch fire until they would fall like the ash from my cigarette
While on the flip side I've built up my legacy
Bars on more bars on more bars, I'm a triple threat
Spitting like dilophosauruses, many verses and a lot of choruses
And I've seen a bunny rabbit in a race go fast
But I'm thinking more like the tortoises
Main attraction at Jurassic Park
I'm like a T-Rex mixed with a Mako shark
You better play your part
Cause my brain so sharp
You gon' cut your-damn-self tryna be this smart
See when I brainstorm fill the air with shrapnel
And when I swoop down like a pterodactyl
Show em all why I'm the king up in the castle
And they recognize that anywhere I travel
Anywhere I go to, any state I roll through
I'm still ice cold on the stage, I'll show you
The shit I go through on a daily basis made me who I am, we ain't trading places

[Verse 2]
Rookies not showing respect to me definitely will be getting me irate
You ain't taking no food off of my plate
Address me as captain, you lightweight
I've been around for a minute now, sit down
Get that ego out of my face
Oh you got you some plays on your Soundcloud?
Bitch, I was popping on Myspace!
I was rapping in the goddamn lunch line
Before it was cool to be doing so
Before I had hair on my nuts I was tearing them up, and I knew I had room to grow
And I still truly know that I am numero motherfuckin' uno and that's indisputable
Treating the studio like it's my cubicle
Since I was nothing but just a young juvenile
Cause I've been stuck underground with the sabertooth tigers, I need me a paleontologist
I've just been puffing my loud with an eighth and a lighter
And seeking to make my accomplishments
Known to the people that follow my steps
From when I first started to rocking with Tech
And a 50 show tour, across the U.S
All that I'm asking you for is respect
I've put in my sweat and I've put in my blood
And some tears have been shed as I've been on my path
Just follow my story and follow my steps
By the giant reptilian tracks
I've survived while I've watched others going extinct and become just a thing of the past
Shit, the fact that I'm still here at all is a show of my skill, it's as simple as that
