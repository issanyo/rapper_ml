[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm a Super Villain, where the fucks Kick ass?
One kick to the chest will give em' whiplash
Crack a 6-pack, light a bogie up
Twist a Bamboo, cause bein' sober sucks
I'm the dopest young buck with this rap shit
Crazy mothafucker in need of a strait jacket
Rap it, grab the track and face bash it
Every instrument and the beat will lay in the casket
Ha, cause you know I leave em' hurt son
On the Grassy Knoll, sniper rifle Nerf Gun
You ain't ready for the crazy shit that Chris'll pull
Fuckin' despicable, leavin' every hater miserable
Kick facts, so come with a diss track
I'll hit em' so hard they can't help but sit back
I spit raps amazin'
And flip the fuck out like Liam Neeson
When his daughter was kidnapped and Taken

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I'm mentally insane, on more cocaine than Rick James
Chuggin' Dubra while I be drivin' and switch lanes
This kid's brains suffers psychosis
Runnin' into on comin' traffic with a helmet and a roach clip
The dope shit, that roll and smoke shit
Hotter than bein' on the equator with a coat zipped
Get your boat flipped, I'll leave em' capsized
They smell the chronic in the air when I pass by
I give em' bad vibes, but you know I flow butter
Gave Steve Austin the stone cold stunner
Took a shovel out and I buried The Undertaker
Drop the scissors and attacked rock with paper
Lord Vader mixed with a little Darth Maul
Pedal to the medal til the fuckin' car stalls
Adderall, Ritalin, LSD
I'm meet you up in Webby's world, yo follow me!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I always got one eye open like a coked up Cyclops
No time for sleep, not a day that the grind stops
Kill a beat when I grab the mic, watch
Connect more dots than a bag of dice got
The raps I drop get flipped like I-HOP
Throw more kicks than Noob Saibot cause I rock
Make time stop like the Prince of Persia
Wanted in 47 states, lyrical murder
So believe the shit, I plead the fifth
After I force feed a bulimic chick Swedish fish
I'm an evil prick, with some diesel piff
Slaughter any competition that I'm beefin' with
Beatin' Chris? nah, not likely
I'll whoop my own ass with a tire iron, now come fight me
Till God strikes me down, I'll keep goin'
Givin' Satan himself this free promotion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
