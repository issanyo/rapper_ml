[Hook: Chris Webby & RyattFienix]
Feeling like nobody knows me so I’m pouring out my soul
The game I’m in is lonely but this shit is all I know
Riding in my Chevy down this one way road
Taking it slow, but still I’m losing control
It’s just a day in the life
Things that keep you up awake through the night
Praying that the moves I’m making are right
Tryna find myself a way through the fight
Yeah, it’s just a day in the life

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Came up in the game just a youngin with a mean flow
Here to rock until the clock hits zero
Feel like I’m seeing the world through a peep hole
Stressed out, what you think I’m smoking weed for?
Gotta put one in the air like a free throw, or a G4
All these people doubting me and judging me without knowing me
So what you mean though?
Living life, what you hating on me for?
Oh you mad after finally getting mine
All these years on the grind I’m dropping shit
And now I’m getting shine, breaking records online
But every single one of my accomplishments
Comes at a cost, losing my mind
Always faded off of that pot prescript
Can’t slip up, I don’t got time
Nobody ever built a kind of watch for this
This life it’ll break you down so get ready
Driving down this one way road in my Chevy
Carrying the weight of the world is too heavy
So let me show you people what it’s like being Webby
So doubt me, judge me, hate me, love me
Either fucking way I’m making it
Cause I was made for this, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
See, everyone thinks they know how this life works
But they don’t see the negatives
On tour at least half of the year
Missing holidays and hardly seeing my relatives
They don’t know about the stress of the game
Everyday damn day, shit it got me popping sedatives
Like they fucking jelly beans, will I ever see the end of this?
If I do, shit, will I even remember it?
I don’t know man, all this rapping shit
Got me second guessing everything I had convinced
At the end of the day, fuck it I asked for this
I wouldn’t take it back for shit
I’ma soldier, with a good head on my shoulders
In it til I win it or I get a game over
Feeling like I’m on a roller coaster
Friends turn to foes and my heart grows colder
Drawn to the game like a moth to the flame
Sacrifice it all for the fame
But it’s all worth it when you up on stage and they calling your name
No doubt I’ll be paying the price in the end
But I’m cool now taking a right down the road untraveled
Seatbelt strapped in, this is just another day in the life

[Bridge]
And I’m feeling like I’m losing my mind
This game will lock you up for certain
But I’m doing my time
I keep a smile on my face, I keep my head to the sky
And in the end I know I’ma be alright

[Hook: RyattFienix & Chris Webby]

[Outro]
Yeah, to all my friends and family
To all the fans
Thank you for believing in me, man
We here now
