Yup, I’m back
Round two mothafucka
Chris Webby

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yo, it’s the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper, you don’t wanna start bro
The combination of Donatello and Leonardo
Michelangelo and Raph rolled into one
With the knowledge of Master Splinter, so Shredder is done (Finish him)
Coppin’ pizza by the box
I’m the new creature on the block, no beatin’ what I got
And I’m heatin’ up the spot
The way I rip it on the mic even Jesus gotta watch
Reachin’ to the top, battlin’ the villains
And a court case, cause they tryna’ send me to prison
I’m the illest white dude that ya never heard
I’m the shit, for lack of a better word
I’m a dog like a boxer or a pug
Bout to make a splash in the game, got water in the tub
And I thought you were a thug
But then they scared to battle me cause I could squash em like a bug
Mixin’ 5-hour energy with Hennessy
Mind so fcked up I can’t even remember me
Spit it doper rhyme, homie I am so defined
Rollin’ up more joints than a cobra's spine
I am the master of the metaphors
Rip it from Connecticut, Australia to Ecuador
Settle scores easy, I do not try
I just put one in the air like carbon dioxide
I’m Popeye after digestin' a can of spinach
I’m handlin’ business, say more in a sec than you can in a minute
Animalistic, you cannot attack this
One punch make em back flip the fuck off the atlas
I’m a Tempur-Pedic mattress, I’ll leave an impression
Danny Glover with the lethalest weapon
Come back and I gotsta get it
Joints rolled so big you think a Rasta did it
Sippin’ on some Jell-O shots with some vodka in it
Known for notoriety, I’m Big Papa with it
So now listen up to ya boy
Roll one up, kick ya feet up, sit back and enjoy
Uh
