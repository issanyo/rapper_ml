[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head

[Verse 1]
Sittin' by the water in the sand
Buildin' castles til the tide rolls in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a refugee in Neverland
Thought my feet would never land again
Don't let the world steal your magic
The rising tide is automatic
Use your time wisely while you have it
Because tomorrow never stays
And yesterdays just a page
In a book of life
So catch the wind 'til you flying high
With that birds eye view from the sky
You'll feel that wind chill
That's just growing up
Case you know they say that castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
And I know that I can do anything
Yeah you can do anything
Nothings impossible
You're unstoppable
But you gotta grow
Listen up

[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head

[Verse 2]
Growing up little man
From a seed to a bigger plan
Even if you can't see there's a bigger plan
Young soul, so low in the solar system
And the clock is ticking and the world is cold
And then one instance your world could go
From the Little John to the Super Bowl
Flipped upside down like vertigo
So here we go, up up and away now
Never see the world if you stay up on the playground
Can't see the stars if you stay indoors
You can never have it all if you don't want more
You can never have light if you don't endure the darkness
Til it shines so bright you can feel the sun
But you gotta set sail in the sea regardless
Say goodbye that the beach that you leaving from (yeah)
But don't let it get to you now
There's gravity pulling you down
Keepin' one foot on the ground
Trying to keep you from looking around
But look at you now
Little man you're growing up
And ya here for more than showing up
But you gotta close one door in order for the next one to open up
But just take it slow, oh, oh
Everything is gonna be alright (yeah)
Just let it go, oh, oh
Your time is now but it's running out (running out, running out)

[Chorus]
You're growing up little man
All the castles in the sand gone with the tide now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
You're growing up little man
You got the world up in your hands, better hold on to it tight now
It's all a part of the plan
Stand tall, you gon' be all right now, just hold ya head
