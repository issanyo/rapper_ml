[Chorus]
Yeah I want a couple milli in my debit account
And I want a car so foreign it's too hard to pronounce
And I want a bong so big that I could light up an ounce
Yeah I want, solid gold toilet bowls in my house, yeah

[Verse 1]
(No, no) No more livin' with my mom and dad
Now they got a guest room in my ballin' pad
Got a salt water pool where the dolphin's at
(Hello? Warren Buffet's on the line) Shit, I'll call him back
Can't you see I'm tryna rap here, Mary?
Oh yeah, that's Mary, my full-time secretary
She got no gag reflex, not at all
So uh, y'all can imagine how she got the job
And my refrigerator full of champagne
Dresser drawer full of uncut cocaine
Turn my dining room into a fuckin' arcade
Yeah, that'll be the day

[Chorus]
Yeah I want a couple milli in my debit account
And I want a car so foreign it's too hard to pronounce
And I want a bong so big that I could light up an ounce
Yeah I want solid gold toilet bowls in my house

[Bridge]
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah I want, solid gold toilet bowls in my house

[Verse 2]
(With the, with the) With the helipad, and a live in chef
His name's Jeff, and he keeps my kitchen fresh
Saut√©in' mushrooms with a chicken breast
And then we tag team hoes on my private jet
I got exotic pets, they all around me chillin
Stretch hot tub with a thousand women
And a castle bigger than Bowser lived in
With a secret back room where I count my millions
Got money stacks stashed away
My garage got cars in a vast array
A whole island to myself like Castaway
Yeah, that'll be the day

[Chorus]
Yeah I want a couple milli in my debit account
And I want a car so foreign it's too hard to pronounce
And I want a bong so big that I could light up an ounce
Yeah I want solid gold toilet bowls in my house

[Bridge]
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want that good life, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah I want solid gold toilet bowls in my house

[Verse 3]
Yeah I got 24 karats in my shower head
Toilet bowl, and a frame that's around my bed (what)
I got Ms. America givin' back rubs in my solid gold bathtub
'Cause you know that I be livin' life like Mr. Deeds
With a diamond rollin' tray where I twist my trees
So picture me on every Forbes list you see
'Cause I'ma get there eventually
(So everybody say)

[Chorus]
Yeah I want a couple milli in my debit account
And I want a car so foreign it's too hard to pronounce
And I want a bong so big that I could light up an ounce
Yeah I want solid gold toilet bowls in my house
Yeah I want a couple milli in my debit account
And I want a car so foreign it's too hard to pronounce
And I want a bong so big that I could light up an ounce
Yeah I want solid gold toilet bowls in my house
