[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I couldn't stop starin' when I saw her at the bar
Walked over and introduced, she said "I know who you are"
She said she liked the rapper type, no matter if their black or white
And I'm like, "Hmm, it looks like I'm gettin' ass tonight"
Spit some ill game then it was back to the house
Bent her over then I hit it from the back on the couch
Banged out for two hours then she slipped me her digits
Called that bitch the next day cause I still had to hit it
Then the night after that, then the night after that
To the point I'm thinkin' I might wife it in fact
We decided to go out, it started goin' well
The sex was straight ill, plus she was sexy as hell
But she was obsessive as fuck, straight up nuts
Started lookin' through my facebook, texts and stuff
Comin' at me like "Who's Amy?" "Nobody, you're my baby"
But little did she know that I'd been bangin' Amy lately

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Oh yea... that text, that text message was nothin' baby
Amy's uhh... Amy's my study partner in class
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
We, we do like lab's and shit together, I swear to God yo
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Yea don't worry about it, you my baby
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Stupid ass mother fuckin' bitch
Can't stand this bitch!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
We still stayed together cause the sex was unbeatable
But she was straight obsessive to the point it's unbelievable
I still hit Amy on the side with stealth
Comin' home to, "If you left me, I'd kill myself
For real, I love you baby, we'll always be together
We'll get married, have kids, and love each other forever"
And I'm like, "Uhhh, shit she's a nuts bitch
A psycho, one I never should have fucked with"
The next day I come home and she's sittin' all alone
Balling her eyes out and lookin' through my damn phone
"So who the fuck's Amy? I just read this text
'Last night was amazing, ' oh what'd you have sex?"
"Baby she's my study partner yo, don't you remember?"
"In what fucking class? You said that shit last semester!"
"You know what fuck this, grab all your shit
And get the fuck out of my house, crazy ass bitch!"

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
Yea that's right get, the fuck outta here
Crazy mother fuckin' bitch
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Grab your shoes
Yea grab those stank ass underwear from out of my room too
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
I ain't even playin' with you bitch, get the fuck out
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
All in my shit yo, what the fuck is wrong with you? Get the fuck out
Damn!

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
We broke up, but I still can't get rid of this female
She called, sent texts, shit she even left emails
Just tryna get her out of my life, she's really scarin' me
(Phone ring) "Hi baby," "Bitch go seek therapy!"
So one night me and Amy come back to the crib
Flip the lights on, and there she is
Holdin' a pistol and I'm like "Where the fuck'd you get a gun?"
"What I never told you? My dad has one
Oh what, so I finally get to meet this little whore?"
(Bang, Bang) And Amy dropped to the floor
"You been fuckin' her the whole time and called me baby!"
"I can see why your angry but you ain't have to shoot Amy!"
Now my mind's racin' as I thought of the words
"Just give me the gun babe, we'll go back to the way we were."
"You promise?" "I promise, I love you yo
Just give me the gun please, yea, nice and slow"

[Hook]
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
"Yea there you go, just give me... there you go
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Pull a fucking gun on me! ? Are you out of your fucking mind?
(She's mostly a ghost, the way she watches over me)
You fucking psycho bitch, you have crossed the mother fuckin' line!
(She's controlling my brain activity, knowing when I go)
Nah, nah ya know what, BITCH!
(Gun cock and fire)
Oh shit...
(She's not so usual.)
