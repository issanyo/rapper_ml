[Hook: Chris Webby]
Just vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Verse 1: Sap]
I keeps a bunch of different colored hoes, yo I miss match
Homies outside of my clique that carry click-clack
Got ‘em sayin’ I’m the truth ‘cause I spit facts
So these niggas really can’t see me like it’s pitch black
Nigga, this that, oh you runnin’ shit? I missed that
The tables turned, now you wonder where your bitch at
They like, “Sap, we know you do it, don’t overdo it”
‘Cause I’m bringin’ way too much liquor to the kick back
Hoes love me like Denzel in '05
I trust no ho, doin’ well with no job
That weak shit you makin’ requires a slow nod
You beggin’ for spares, niggas get played with no prob
Just because they know I’m, dope with no cosign
Screamin’, “Sap it’s yo time, turn this into show time”
But step back and let me do just that
I’m getting’ off like I do just rap, so turn it up and just

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
See the white boy back up in this bitch, and now I’m 2.0
And ain’t nobody makin’ all the fuckin’ noise that I be
Drive real slow with them seats down low
Rims shinin’ like the leaves on poison ivy
Smoke is all up in my vehicle so, you know I be gettin’ bent like origami
But this life of mine is like Life of Pi
Yeah, I gotta hang tough when the water choppy
Vibe to it, I’m the vibrator, ‘bout to blow so big I’ma leave behind craters
Tell ‘em, “Hi hater”
If you like it or not, my song’s stuck in your head like I wrote ‘em on fly paper
Ain’t no time taken stressed out
We turnin’ up until your head bounce
And burn another from my fresh ounce
Vibe right and I’m takin’ it slow, doin’ me the only way that I know
So everybody go and

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Vibe to it, watch how I do it
Rolling windows down, and then ride to it
Dealing with the seat back, and recline to it
Just turn the volume high, and then vibe to it
Now vibe to it, watch how I do it
Turn it up, and party the whole night to it
Throw some weed in the bong, and get high to it
Just turn the volume high and then vibe to it

[Outro: Chris Webby] (x5)
