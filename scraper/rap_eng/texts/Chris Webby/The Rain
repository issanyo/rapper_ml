[Hook (2x):]
We've been in the rain*
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire
And fancy hotels
Drank water from the well

[Verse 1 :Chris Webby]
Uh I'm stepping in this game and paying dues
Building a reputation now we making major moves
And now it's moving, how it's moving anyway I choose
And I've been working way to hard to just not make it through
You talk about me, prepare for what I say to you
Cause I'm a man and I will stand by what I say and do
There's a lot of ups and downs within this game of life
For every hater there's a girl that wants to stay the night
And now I got myself a taste of the fame
I'm addicted I've got nothing else to chase
I kill it on the stage but still I miss the days
Of chilling in the crowd like a normal kid my age
But still I got this paper and still I got my pencil
And the craziest part is I haven't hit my full potential
The life I live is stressful, everyday suspenseful
Grinding every minute of my life to be successful

We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountains
We've been round the fire

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Uh I'm trying to make it with my sanity
Moving from the underground roots up to the canopy
Do it how I do it I just hope they understanding me
Trying to make it right with every member of my family
I know I was the mess up but now Chris stepped up
And took hold of what I always wanted from the setup
Now when people mention me they saying I'm the next up
It's been a long time since that A.D.D. checkup
The underclassman's graduated, top of the class
Now when I walk around town people nod when they pass
I'm just a kid who messed his life up and put it back together
A kid who hit the bottom and came back stronger than ever
I've been jerked around, stolen from, told I would fail
But now the numbers going up on every check in the mail
And if they not feeling it, ill spit it in brail
Hating on me gets you know where keep on chasing your tail

We've been in the rain
We've been on the mountains

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
You think the life I live is wonderful
Let me give you the flipside
Try to go with the flow and get caught up in the riptide
Everyday it's studio or driving to a show
And no I'm not complaining I'm just letting people know
There's a lot of hard work that goes right into the grind
Especially without being signed and working overtime
Now every time I meet a girl there is a difference
Cause all they want is Webby without even meeting Christian
They just want to fuck, maybe roll an l
And go back in the morning with a story to tell
And though it sounds great, the side of it you don't see
Is that the end of the day you're still lonely
The fans show me love and I love my ninjas back
They hold me down and I'm forever thankful of that
And I won't let you down you have my word on that
Cause I'm here for good the best of the burbs is back
