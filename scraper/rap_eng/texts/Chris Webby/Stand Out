[Verse 1: D. Lector]
Bitch you know my MO, behind bars like i'm on Death Row
When I get the best Dro from the West Coast, even though CT is where I rep ho
So let's go, Mister [?] got the fresh flow
I guess so, stomach full of french toast, some egg rolls and benzos
I don't get low, I stay high, stay high then wave bye
Stage dive then run through the crowd with chainsaws screaming "Gay Pride"
Cut you faggots in half, label it a hate crime
At age nine, put a steak knife through this cat but he still had eight lives
Not afraid to die, he was made to survive
Devil with an angels' eyes
You're stuck wondering why your ankles are tied, wasting time
Crazy mind that's saying rhymes, giving you both
I'm huge as Hulk, [?]
You're just plain stupid, i'm stupid dope
Body full of booze and smoke, choose and growth, even my blood cells look like music notes, cause all I know is music yo
I'm usually unusual
So you should probably move it bro, I'm the shit .com backslash you's a ho

[Chorus: Chris Webby]
Cause i'm just trying to live my life, and shit, i'm doing it however I like
I been standing on the edge for a minute now, kept myself from looking down
Just tell myself i'll be alright
Then i'm thinking: Fuck if you like me, step into my Nikes, I'm always going to hold my ground
Never fitting in with the crowd, through the ups and the downs, i'm the man that [?] when I Stand Out

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Oooh, here goes Chris again, don't know what to mention, I'm living it
Ever since I could remember, I was always standing out, fuck fitting in
With my tilted brim and my pants low, looking for a chick I can stick it in
Puffed a few pills and i'm feeling 'em, said I wouldn't but i've got no self discipline
So fuck it, i'm wilding out on these ho bags, leave toe tags
On any instrumental, my murder weapon is that notepad
Always on the road like a nomad, feeling like i'm really gonna' go mad
And shit, even Malcolm in the Middle's father [?]
Now it's time for the Mega Sword, fully charged up and i'm ready for it
All that's in front of me, puffin' a blunt or three 'til my brain can't take any more
As Betty [?], Should I relapse, I rolled that, repeat that
Ayo girl, I leaned back, while she's on, her knee-caps
I'm crazy, I've lost it, stand out from the rest of the game dude
Throwing punches even quicker than Bane, one shot to the brain if i came to
I'm Sun Tzu, you're a shih tzu
I'm a Great Dane with no chain, you should run
'Cos this dog'll have his date, even if he's got to face you

[Chorus: Chris Webby]
Cause i'm just trying to live my life, and shit, i'm doing it however I like
I been standing on the edge for a minute now, kept myself from looking down
Just tell myself i'll be alright
Then i'm thinking: Fuck if you like me, step into my Nikes, I'm always going to hold my ground
Never fitting in with the crowd, through the ups and the downs, i'm the man that [?] when I Stand Out
