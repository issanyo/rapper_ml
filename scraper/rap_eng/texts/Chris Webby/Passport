[Intro]
Yeah, we going all around the world
You know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, i'm travelling to parts unknown, send a postcard home
Living like the fucking Travelocity gnome
Hit the mountains in Colorado to get in the zone
A route in Cali' smoking weed stronger than Jessica Jones
Yeah, I grew up by the water so you know I'm always coasting
Summer in the sky with my phone saying roaming
Land in Las Vegas for a little fear and loathing
Cigarette holder, and women with no clothing
Hit Europe in the summer when the weather fucking beautiful
Then dip out to Australia, rolling with the marsupial
See, ever since the juvenile, my skill been indisputable
I knew that there was no way out, would end up in the cubical
I just kept it moving, 'nother day 'nother city
'Nother country, 'nother continent, and they be rocking with me
Channel Anthony Bourdain with the new, catch a plane and then we
In the skies, so goodbye

[Chorus]
They ain't let me in front, so i'm breaking in the back door
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport, yeah
I'ma put another couple stamps on my-
I'm always about my business, so i'm learning how to stag more
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport
They think i'm Bourdain when they looking at my passport

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I be out in Africa just trying to save the elephants
Or way out in the Amazon before people develop it
And greedy corporate interests come around and fucking level it
I be in Peru on Ayahuasca for the hell of it
Snorkel on the great barrier, before it's dead and shit
I route Antarctica, before climate change has melted it
I'm trying to see the beauty of the planet 'fore we wrecking it
Step out into nature at it's finest and connect with it
I started in Connecticut, now i'm out in Catalina
Rolling with my travel Visa, laying where the grass is greener
We're out in Pasadena, lighting up the gasolina
We're sipping coffee out in Cuba with a bad barista
I'ma cross meridians to hang with Argentinians
The heat with the Sicilians, and party with Floridians
Then I roll one up and go get high in the Caribbeans
Thinking to myself: "What a world we living in!"

[Chorus]
They ain't let me in front, so i'm breaking in the back door
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport, yeah
I'ma put another couple stamps on my-
I'm always about my business, so i'm learning how to stag more
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport
They think i'm Bourdain when they looking at my passport

[Bridge]
I've been 'round the globe, where I go, I don't know
I've been- I've been 'round the globe, coming Santiago
I've been- I've been 'round the globe, doing shows, getting dope
I've been- I've been 'round the globe, about the parts unknown
I've been 'round the globe, where I go, I don't know
I've been 'round the globe, coming Santiago
I've been 'round the globe, doing shows, getting dope
I don't- I don't- parts unknown

[Chorus]
They ain't let me in front, so i'm breaking in the back door
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport, yeah
I'ma put another couple stamps on my-
I'm always about my business, so i'm learning how to stag more
Take over the world, 'bout to give them what they asked for
I'ma put another couple stamps on my passport
They think i'm Bourdain when they looking at my passport
