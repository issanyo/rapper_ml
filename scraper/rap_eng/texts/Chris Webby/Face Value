[Intro]
Yeah, Webby, DJ Hoppa, uh-huh
Let's fucking do this, you know? (let's go!)
I'm the one they came to see
Yeah, I'm the one they came to see (uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'm the one they came to see
Yeah, I'm the one they came to see (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm here, everybody should start your evacuation
Cause I'm fucking nuts, so says my doctor evaluation
Fuck all of these allegations, I'm calm and I've got my patience
I don't need no major label to market me to their patrons
All I've got is lyrics, drunk charges and reputation
For popping pills and drinking and partying in my basement
Eating shrooms like a modern day Mario, getting wasted
And chewing triple stack stars 'til my heart is done palpitating
So pardon me, I'm just saying, my job is in entertainment
Got a problem? I'm not gonna say sorry, you ignoramus
I'm already getting famous and y'all just couldn't contain this
So fuck it, let's just see how much farther that I could take it
So start your examination and study all of my bars
You'll discover quick that you couldn't even go half as hard
As I do, try to, you'll pull a muscle, because
I'm a beast, I'm a dog, I'm a fucking rap god

[Hook]
Anywhere I go you can find us
Putting in work cause it ain't for free
And when you see them getting lined up
Wait around anxiously
I'm the one they came to see
I'm the one they came to see
Yeah, I'm the one they came to see
I'm the one they came to see
I'm the one they came to see
Yeah, I'm the one they came to see

[Verse 2]
See this rapping shit, I mastered it, proving it to the masses
With a stroke of genius like Steve Jobs on an acid trip
I can't relax a bit, everyday I have to spit
Webby's a star, they calling me Young Asterisk
You flaccid dicks will never go as hard as me
This clever artistry has always been a part of me
It ain't hard to see that when I go and drop a bar or three
I fucking nail it like I was apprenticing in carpentry (pardon me)
Listen as I break it down accordingly
And if you don't listen then I'll grab that ear forcefully
This is my house, I've been paying off my mortgage B
Eating now, but didn't get this food up on my fork for free (Bitch!)
I work for it, every verse and every chorus
Every minute on the train on my way to go record it
I've been sitting in the rain back before I got on tour
With a dollar to my name tryna make a little more of it
Baby, now I'm sure of this shit my life is a musical
They paying me to do what I love and this shit is beautiful
I'm putting oil on that rig nail like a cuticle
While you hating behind a computer up in a cubicle

[Hook]
