[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah...Webby I’m like a young Capone at the table in a pinstripe suit/ boss shit CEO of all the shit I do/ independent on the grind with a big IQ/ with that complex flow, y'all just spit Haikus/ a kid like you, the only difference is the job description/ ever since I wrote my first line in a composition/ notebook, yo look, so sick I got botulism ain't no competition, just stop and listen I gotta get 'em/ uhh call me Zues shit I’m standing with a lighting strike/ on top of Mt. Olympus getting ready for a titan fight/ cause I’m a mother fucking rider call me Michael Knight/ stackin', only sign a piece of paper if the price is right/ so sorry Mr. Barker but we goin' harder and corner these lambs to the slaughter drown them in holy water/ I’m often in this bottle of Henny and Marijuana/ but I’m colder than the blood in the body of an iguana/ uhh Slide your mother to the right on Tinder/ GPS it to your crib and then I slide up in her/ And I’ll hit it so good that she’ll make me dinner/ eating steak up on your couch get my weight up quicker/ man, lay it down with them big boy skills/ poppin' a Xanax with a fish oil pill/ And I wash it all down with a box of the wine/ reporting live muh fucker yo it's Optimus Rhymes/C. Webb!

My name is Audio Jones, from Miami. When I was making that beat, I was starting off with the sample. If you're not careful, it can influence your sound a little too much. I wanted that classic feel

[Producer Audio Jones speaks]

I've been producing ever since I was fifteen, so about ten years now. My method for producing is just going in there...and it's a feeling. Rapfest is the best platform for producers, they show love. We finally got a place where we can shine!
