[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like I suck at life
I started last year and the depression with my money tight
Then I said fuck it, hit the gas and started running lights
Reinvigorated all my fans by droppin' fuckin' twice as much shit as I did the year before and kept it comin' like
Every single week and went at everyone in fuckin' sight
I just bottled up my raw thoughts up on this fuckin' mic
Said fuck these rappers and the rappers that they mumble like
Yeah, I went on Sway and killed the game and got a ton of likes
Still they just compare me to Shady so I'm just fuckin' like
Well, he's debatebly the greatest so basically what your tryna' say to me is I'm fuckin' nice
But I'm my own man, my own MC
Who handed mix tapes to cats when I sold them tree
Yeah I've had a long run still ain't lost no steam
I'm still rackin' up streams I just do it low-key
I don't even have a manager, I own my own masters
See I'm my own master more than a dope rapper
Been a long road, there's a lot of closed chapters
But I made a promise to myself to never go backwards
I been underrated so fuckin' long that I'm sick of it
It keeps me lashin' out at anybody in my vision, shit
I'll add another name to my list if we gon' get into it
Wrap my hands around your neck so you can come to grips with it
Made a name takin' shots, Donald Trump is sick of me
And crooked Hillary just put a seven figure hit on me
Lil Xan is wishin' that he never said shit to me
And everyone I haven't mentioned yet is sittin' timidly
I came to bring the pain, spinnin' webs in your brain
Study the arts of Wu-Tang
I ain't goin' anywhere like the Cabernet stain
With that audio dope to your veins

[Chorus]
I came a long way
Ain't no doubt about it I came a long way
Saw them take the route but I took the long way
Dancin' to the beat of my own drum
I came a long, I came a long, I came a long
I came a long way (yellin' danger, I'm the one they afraid of)
I came a long way (I'm a glacier, too cold for the majors)
I came a long way (It's my nature, bout to show them what I'm made of)
I came a long, I came a long, I came a long, I came a long, I came a long

[Verse 2]
Y'all know I'm comin' when you hear my medication rattle
Mad disorders, dealin' with them all's a daily battle
But don't confuse that with thinkin' my fuckin' brain is fragile
Cause this shit got so many words in it that I'm playin scrabble
And my fuckin' dreams with a scheme that'll leave your cages rattled
This real rap straight facts got a case of Snapple
The Judge and Jury of your face so let me raise the gavel
An arsonist I got y'all leavin' here on blazing saddles
I'm here to break all these soft snowflakes
With all their Twitter hot cakes but won't show no face
Everyone with they opinions that don't hold no weight
This whole world gone pussy but I won't slow pace
Everyone's an influencer or a YouTube star with no talent
And no reason to know who you are
Do you hear me Jake and Logan Paul?
I'll inject them with a Michael Jackson dosage of Propofol until their dozin' off
I've fuckin' had it with everybody this shit disgusts me
I thought that rap was at it's lowest when y'all hit the dougie
But now it's worse everybody soundin' really rusty
I gotta listen to myself cause there's no shit to study
My competition's supposed to inspire me
But y'all suck so fuckin' bad gotta listen to my CD
Shit, I don't mean all of 'em but let's be honest
I'm one of the hottest, best in the burbs and I still got it
Louis CK, I'm feelin' myself, I'm here for the belt
My adversaries fear for their health
Because I never gave a fuck about appearance and wealth
I put bars over everything, you'll hear for yourself
Every time you put my shit on, these beats I never miss on
And when I'm dead and gone just know these words are gonna live on
The same kid they picked on is now who they click on
So suck the same dick I told Ted Cruz to sit on

[Chorus]
I came a long way
Ain't no doubt about it I came a long way
Saw them take the route but I took the long way
Dancin' to the beat of my own drum
I came a long, I came a long, I came a long
I came a long way (yellin' danger, I'm the one they afraid of)
I came a long way (I'm a glacier, too cold for the majors)
I came a long way (It's my nature, bout to show them what I'm made of)
I came a long, I came a long, I came a long, I came a long, I came a long way
