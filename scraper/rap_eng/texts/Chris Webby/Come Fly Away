[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I’m in flight school, I’m takin’ flight brother
Pilot of my own plane like the Wright brothers
Pull an Amelia Earhart
And just sky-rocket to the top of the charts
I’m with John Glenn and Neil Armstrong on the moon
Blastin’ off to Mars, I should be there soon
Skip Jupiter and hop right over to Neptune
Hit warp drive, aliens be smellin’ the fumes
I’m so fly I’m in the galaxy, no handlin’ me
I chill on Pluto, cause man you’re still a planet to me
I take flight everyday, launch pad, okay
Rock Orion’s Belt and dip my cookies in the Milky Way like

[Hook]
Come, come fly away with me
We’ll wander through the stars
And touch down on Mars
So come and fly away with me
No need for gravity out in the galaxy
So come and fly

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I live it how I say when I ride that beat
Not even Captain Kirk know how to fly like me
In outer space, somethin’ like Anakin
Then I turn to Vader and can’t nobody damage him
I could make the planet spin, peace and I’m outta here
Lightin’ up a blunt as I’m passin’ through the atmosphere
Pass it to my passenger, mami’s gettin’ high now
Me and her are nothin’ but a light up in the sky now
Sex on a space station and she loves it
No gravity needed we just does it
Fly can’t top me, can’t nobody stop me
Better get your telescope out and just watch me
Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I am now so fly that astronomers study me
Time to fly away, mami you should come with me
Scoop her up in the Big Dipper
Crash-land on Saturn, burn and sip liquor
Earth is okay, I’m right here today
But tomorrow I’m gonna be light-years away
No Apollo 13, mothafuck a space shuttle
Way above SkyLab, stars, and the Hubble
Causin’ mad trouble, cause home was too boring
But I’ll be back eventually when I’m finished exploring
So, ground control to Major Tom
I’m gone to infinity and beyond

[Hook]

So come and fly
So come and fly
If you could fly, would you fly with me, with me?
If you could fly, would you fly with me?
