[Intro]
Yeah, can I get a, pack of Marlboro 27's please?
Yeah, thank you, thank you
My card was declined?! My uhh, well fuck man how much are they?
Nine dollars!? God damn it
Man I got six, i got six, can we... No?
Man FUCK!

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round

[Verse 1]
Webby
Watch my peers getting richer as they sold they soul
Like fox selling out I'd rather be dope then broke
But as I got a little older, this roller coaster of life
Got me feeling like I closed one door
Another opens up with a new expense to pay
Car insurance, health insurance, with that dental date
Keep asking, "Why you living with your rentals, eh?"
You get it now? I don't got no fucking rent to pay
I made it big in the game but I sure ain't rich
How I invisioned being famous just sure ain't this
If I only had a nickel for every word I spit
But I don't, so now it's time I go and stir up shit
Cause I'm just tryin' to get that money and I don't care how
So fucking bad I'm 'bout to pull that BB gun back out
Run up in the liquor store like, "Bitch get on the ground
Give me the cash, and some whiskey, and a dutch right now!"

[Pre-Chorus]
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary
Repeat
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round

[Verse 2]
And as this, the money comes in and then it goes
As quick as it came from shooting this videos
The beats and the time spent in the studio
And then it runs out, well time to do some shows
And you've got all the expenses of honor roll
Salaries for the team and vehicle
Gas, food, hotel rooms, that's a lot of dough
"Why you complaining, ain't this what you've always wanted, yo?"
I guess so I just need a bigger check sir
Maybe have a couple diamonds hanging from my neck sir
And I'm below full of cash in my dresser
That's higher than my overall current net worth
"Well Mac Miller's got money" Yeah you probably right
I got an idea, let's just go and rob him tonight
Like, "Hey, we haven't spoken since 'I Need a Dollar' but like
I still do so run those motherfucker pockets, alright!?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just kidding, what I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary
Repeat
What I'm saying's till I'm dead and buried
I'ma get that money now by any means necessary

[Chorus]
If you don't know then somebody shoulda told ya!
But uhh, ain't shit for free
Like momma always said, ain't no one gon' do it for ya
And I'm sick of tryin' to make end meets
So I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
I like how that sounds
I'm just tryin' to get the money money money money
They say it makes the world go 'round
