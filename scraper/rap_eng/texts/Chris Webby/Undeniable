[Intro]
Yeah, Webby
It's undeniable
Mic check, 1, 2
We rolling, yeah

[Verse 1]
I like them short and stocky
About yea high, and sorta sloppy
On my Tempur-Pedic fold em up like origami
I am Mr. Hankey recording up in a porta-potty
Cause I am the shit
You're the sheep
I'm the border collie
I'm like Thor the Nordic God up in a mortal's body
Take my auto-bot to the auto-body who's calling shotty?
Just cause I'm white they think I'm trying out for golf or hockey
Or know how to ollie
And where to score some molly
When I'm on Spotify it's Coldplay constantly
Like, the whole discography
I sing along when no one's watching me
And have a vegan garden on my property
Use grammar extra properly
And wave super hard when you saying hi to me
Honestly some of you probably think that shit
But I let em speculate while I just bring that sick twisted misfit wit, with a ring that fits
Gladiator when I step into a ring that's it

[Hook]
It's undeniable baby
Got karma on my side, I'mma be alright
Yeah they've been trying me lately
But I feel my second wind picking up my stride
It's undeniable baby
It's undeniable baby

[Verse 2]
My lyrics are like an LSD micro-dose
Recite those quotes
And you won't find a typo, choke, stutter or misspelled word, because I write so dope
Every cell, every molecule and isotope
It's psychedelic in my blood's system
Even the Jewish women love Christian
Even the nuns fuck with him, they say none fuck with him
Nun-chuck hit em
Michelangelo an animal
Eyes low I got the antidote
It's understandable, they can't stand that I managed to reach to the top, so believe it or not
See it and watch, I'm a
Janitor ready to mop motherfuckers
Put that overtime in when I clock motherfuckers
No sick days, no days off, and know we stay late
No holidays with pay, and no vacay
You should probably vacate the premises
The premise is to be the supervillain, rap nemesis, bitch

[Hook]
It's undeniable baby
Got karma on my side, I'mma be alright
Yeah they've been trying me lately
But I feel my second wind picking up my stride
It's undeniable baby
It's undeniable baby

[Outro] x2
Roll the dice I'll throw it all down and take that risk
Now put your money on the table I'mma take that shit
These dollar signs up on my name like that A$AP clique
And if they putting in the call, then I'mma raise that shit
