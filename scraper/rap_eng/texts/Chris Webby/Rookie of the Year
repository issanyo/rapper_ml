[Intro]
It's been a long time
Long time
It's been a long time
Been a long time comin'

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been speaking my mind
Since Ocarina of Time
Dropped on Nintendo 64 but steadily on my grind
I've been building my kingdom, a couple G's at a time
'Til I cop a villa sittin' on a beach with a dime
Sour D and some wine, that's when my livin' is right
Until then, get up out of my way or you'll be dinner tonight
There were days I wanted to quit and live a simpler life
But then the beat in my head bangs and I pick up that mic
Yeah, I represent for that nerd life
And I been a monster, you hear right
When the moons out, I'm a werewolf
So you better go get them search lights
Got a mean bark, and a firm bite
And a weed spark, and like errnight
I been on my mission so now I am takin' the title like it is my birth right
I deserve my time with that fuckin' rock
To go juggernaut, flip it up a notch
I got no brakes, and I'm runnin' stocks (Tires screech)
So get out my way or get fuckin' squashed
I'm a grown man, with a cup of scotch
Puffin' pot, with southern rock
With a hippie chick, that fucks a lot
And lovin's what I got, (What I got)
See I got the sauce motherfucker
I ain't perfect but I work with my flaws, motherfucker
I'ma king up in a world full of pawn motherfuckers
An artist to the end, Bob Ross, motherfucker

[Chorus]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my trunk, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, long time
Okay, I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my trunk, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, It's been a long time comin'

[Verse 2]
I'm a mix of Ferris Bueller, with a little Garry Cooper
As I'm researchin' conspiracy theories on my computer
Glasses on like Uncle Jr droppin' shit for my consumers
With a cougar who can tutor on Kama Sutra maneuvers
Fuck the rumors, I'm a super human, music spewin' veteran
Megazord assemblin', Timberlands and a letterman
I'm colder than the set of The Revenant, when I get it in
Settlin', perfect specimen, let me in
2009 and I'm still that shit
Get on stage and I kill that shit
If your a little bit literate, literally you can feel that shit
And that's brick by brick
No manual, no plan at all, I had to build that shit (Had to build that shit)
But I'm an animal, I kept standing tall, and I did that shit
On top, like bald spots
Make jaws drop, no bad business
Got the formula, in my palm watch
You think I'm cheatin' on math quizzes
And that crosswalk, all my dogs barkin' at mad bitches
'Til my heart stops, got no soft spot for these rap critics, I'm back in it
And I still got my entree comin'
Young baller, out Connecticut like Andre Drummond
Feel that typhoon comin', when that white dude dunkin'
Guarantee you might lose somethin'

[Chorus]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my trunk, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, long time
Okay, I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
It's been a long time, It's been a long time comin'

[Outro]
I'm just warmin' up and they label me a veteran
Rookie of the the year, when I started I was peddlin'
These CD's out my truck, speakers louder than a elephant
Yeah
