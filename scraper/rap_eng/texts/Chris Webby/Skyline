[Verse 1]
I’ve been stuck underground, but now it’s my time
Time to take flight, right in to the skyline
Off to beautiful women sippin’ on fine wine
Up at the stadium where the lights lime
And I’m, movin’ way past sound check
Still lookin’ for a life that I ain’t found yet
Round trip on a magical school bus
Before we touch down, shit they already knew us
Made it from the bottom to professionally rappin’
While they were tellin’ me that it was never gonna happen
Now it’s funny to see the haters’ reactions
Cause they ain’t sayin' a word, Charlie Chaplin
I’m back in this bitch relaxin’
Put in the groundwork now it’s time to cash in
Heh, and everybody knows I earned that
Headed to the skyline, feet up, first class
Yeah!

[Hook]
I don’t know about you but I know one thing
I ain’t gonna wait around here to make it
Anybody with a dream got to feel the same
If it ain’t given to me then I’ma take it
So let me just
Fly fly, fly fly
Cuz they tellin’ me it’s my time
Fly fly, fly fly
And disappear into the skyline

[Verse 2]
Spit the toughest shit, who touchin’ this?
Always chillin’ with a bird, Snuffaluffagus
And I’m lovin’ it, no Mickey D’s
Just Colt 45 and some piffy trees
Jeeze, got my boardin' pass ready
I’m headin' to the top, they ain’t gettin' past Webby
Yeah, been on the grind since 8th grade
Went from gettin' no girls to bangin' Playmates
Heh, what up Ms. November?
My flight’s taking off, got my shit together
Ready for whatever, do it better than before
I’m the reason my competitors are headin’ for the door
Cause I’m deadly and I’m raw with the mic tonight
Got the cameras all flashin’ like a lightning' strike
Heh, I’m on another altitude
And they ain’t ready for the shit that I’m about to do

[Hook: Chris Webby]

[Verse 3]
If you got a dream you should follow it
Cause not everybody’s capable of keepin' straight A’s for a scholarship
As a kid no one could figure me out
So I would like to thank Hofstra for kickin' me out
And look at me now, I’m doin' pretty well for my age
Considerin' two years ago I was makin' minimum wage
Heh, and now we doin' okay, Skyline-flow, up, up and away
Heh, and I ain’t lookin' for a handout
Shit I got the fans now, mothafuckers stand down
Live my life to a whole new beat
Finally standin' on my own two feet
Cause it got that tough, been kicked while I was down
But I never gave in, and I got back up
Yup, gettin' close, well I better be
But all I see is the skyline ahead of me

[Hook]
