[Hook]
I came to pass the blunt around (blunt around)
I fuck around (fuck around)
Pour up a full cup and chug it down
Homie that was yesterday (yesterday), so they wonder how (wonder how)
I can do this every single time I come around
But it’s so eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y
Eazy when you’re W-E-B-B-Y

[Verse 1]
Yeah I’m puffing loud, got me buzzing now
I’m just trying to do some shit that makes my mother proud
Live from the underground, met with all the labels
And they said I could make a million dollars if I dumbed it down
But I said “fuck that!” I’ma do it Web’s way
‘Cause I’m fucking dope, well at least that’s what my friends say
Lyrically a sensei, muy caliente, comprende?
Thursday to Wednesday I be so crazy
It’s not what I try for but it’s my business
Homie you should mind yours
I couldn’t lose my mind more
Jumping out the window on the 9th floor
Now they’re saying they gotta send me to the psych ward
Straightjacketed, a battle it ain’t happenin’
That be like seeing Drake and Rampage in a cage match
And I’ve been put up on this planet to ramble and raise havoc
With a bottle and an eighth a day habit

[Verse 2]
-O-U-N-G veteran, everytime I’m stepping in
Cold as the toes of a penguin
Bad to my skeleton, bad to the bone as I’ve ever been
Feet up on the throne that I’ve settled in
Running off of adrenaline and unprescribed medicine
Lighting up an L again and hit it til my head’ll spin
Started with a crumpled up Lincoln and now it’s Benjamins
Used to be a loser but now the world is watching Webby win
It’s so easy, veni, vidi, vici
Young Houdini, rabbit in my three piece
Used to be on YouTube, now I’m up on TV
Everybody spell it out, it’s W-E-B
Add another B-Y, you’re about to see why
I’m a giant, start my sentences with “fee-fi”
Fo fum, go dumb, putting work in
So it’s time you met the man behind the curtain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Killin’ this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing
I see you dropped your new shit but it ain’t buzzin’
I’m killing this game since it ain’t love us
I do it so easy, it ain’t nothing
I tell em it ain’t nothing, I tell em it ain’t nothing
