[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'm the monster out of Cloverfield, so for real
Fucked up, I don't even know how sober feels
Smother Asher Paul Roth with a fabric wash cloth
That I previously used to wash my ass and balls off
I'm just a dope rapper, in class chasin' a math teacher
With a protractor then copy the notes after
So hot you'll think that I freakin' sleep on a burner
Want beef? I'll force feed a vegan a burger
Slaughter on the mic, I don't need a reason for murder
So A.D.H.D., that I need at least a Concerta
It's Chris Webby, brain dead but still deadly
My shit's heavy, pop pills and twist heddies
So kick and slap me bitch, I'll take it like a masochist
Then turn around and smack you with the mic that you be rappin' with
Cause I'm the opposite of pacifist, choke a ho, slap a bitch
Then leave the room laughin' after it
Like what !

[Hook:]
For myself, I have no regrets
Time has taking what it soon forgets
Again there's paradise, in short venue

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I get up on the beat and I blaze the mic quickly
A serial killer takin' blades to Rice Krispies
An Arabic terrorist in America
If you wanna get at this, I'm triple dog darin' ya
I'm a character like Mickey, Donald, Goofey
Ren and Stimpy, Snoopy, Captain Planet, bitch you best salute me
I'mma loopy looney-tunes with screws-loose, super soakin' dudes deuce
I'm Michael Vick with Blues Clues
I'mma mothafuckin' monster man
Get it poppin' like the guns playin' Contra man
Contraband, stuck in my pipe so let me light it
Got a dark passenger like Dexter, why fight it
Lightsaber, swipe it like Qui-Gon-Jin
(Skurr!) burnin' rubber til I ride on rims
Brim to the side, got a sack to spark
I'm cold-blooded, you can find me in Jurassic Park
Like what

[Hook:]
I feel alone when the Sparrow's sing
No way of knowing what tomorrow brings
I leave my solitude upon his wings

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
My wisdom exceeds all you dumb MC's
I'm young too, but shit I've been rappin' since 3
Since the youngest Jonas Brother was still in his mother's uterus
And Miley Cyrus was in diapers, bitch I ain't new to this
I'm what you get when you mix alcohol and nicotine
Aderall, Ecstacy, Marijuana and Creatine
Acid, Percocet, Vicodin and Ambien
Shrooms, MDMA and toss a Xany in
Then you got me, mind clinically dumb man
I can count my brain cells on one hand
But I drop sick bars, homie, so you gotta look
Bitch, I be nicer with the ink than an Octopus
I'm that villain out the comic book creepin'
Crawlin' out the flames like a demon, breathin'
Flames out my mouth so nobody could touch me
A mix of Buffalo Bill and Bundy, trust me

[Hook:]
Though it's pleasure, is to hear in time
To paint a picture's what he's left behind
I close my eyes and it all leaves my mind
