Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Knocked Down"

[Intro]
We'll be singing, when we're winning
We'll be singing...

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 1]
I get knocked down, but I'mma be back in a minute
Glass full of Guiness till I'm passin' my limit
Shots lined up, throw em back, never sip it
Then my vision goes black and I'm in it
We gon' open that bottle and break it in
Chasin' that Maker's with Jameson
Party when it's Saturday again
But you won't see me on Sunday like mailmen
I'm on my Chumbawamba, clutch a cup of
Vodka shipped in from Mother Russia
Just a bad ass mother fucker
With a bar tab that got me crunchin' numbers
21 and under, this ain't for you
I stay lit drankin' brews and breakin' rules
With straight shots on demand, no Pay Per View
So all I really got to say to you, is..

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down

[Verse 2]
I get knocked down, but I get shit poppin' pronto
.. Pulling up on my Dr. Gonzo
Suit case full with a lot of contro-
Band, my shades on like I'm Johnny Bravo
Grab the liquor get wasted, until we all live in the Matrix
Sippin' my whiskey until I'm like sixty and need me a liver replacement
Really I'm sayin', I guess that sobriety's one of those things I can't do for the life of me
.. I honestly try to be, but bein' sober just gives me anxiety
Knocked down like Apollo Creed, pour four shots and I swallow three
Then I hit a little bit of Colorado tree, and then .. Follow me!

[Bridge]
(Pissing the night away)
This drink is all up in my cup
(Pissing the night away)
Knocked down but I'm gettin' right back up
(Pissing the night away)
And we do not give a fuck
(Pissing the night away)
Knocked down but I'm gettin' right back up

[Hook]
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up (but I get up) you're never gonna keep me down
