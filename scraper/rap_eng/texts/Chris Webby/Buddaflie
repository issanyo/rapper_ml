Ye, ye, ye, ye, yea
Woo, let's go!

Come my lady, come come my lady
I am the MVP you can't trade me
Hate me or love me I spit greatly
Fuckin the track up, my town is crazy
I'll be back on the beat, back like the rear seat
Reclined and now I'm puttin up my feet
Heat is what I produce like rubbing flint
Punches gottcha seeing two like double mint
I'm just trying to cop a dub and split a dutch open
Fill it with that Mary Jane and start smokin'
Rollin' that shit up and get blasted
Smellin' so good in a bag it's orgasmic
Drop rhythms, pop pills till I'm trippin'
So high that my feet are lifting off the ground like a magician
Since I started flippin' I just never stopped spittin'
Now I am a brain surgeon on these pediatricians
Stay whippin', 2 blunts down and stay twistin'
Keep my people closer than the fingers in a mitten
Verbal ammunition and you know I'm never missin'
More fly than, Dancer, Cupid, Donnor and Blitzin
I am Christian, last name is Webster
Tear down the rap game,insane and clever
Buzzed off the cocaine, untamed as ever
Come down harder than rain, spit flames for pleasure
The X I got won't find you treasure
It'll leave you rollin so hard you'll leave in a stretcher
Better than all these clowns, shit I'm blastin off
I am the next, better Asher Roth
With an unheard flow I'm original
CT Criminal
Any opposition? Minimal
Get up in your face, not a message is subliminal
Battle with me simply is not winnable
I am the pinnacle of white raps since I started to write tracks
Blowing up knuckles and fight back
I like that, I might blast off to the moon
Smokin piff for a night
Capped off dogs, so light that
Puff puff pass till you fall on your ass
Quicker than silver and more fast than the flash
I'm a go kill em with my flow while they're ready to go
So bro, you know you can't rap with me
You're about as hard as a virgin daiquiri
Spit some shit, swear to God I was black, yah see
But I'm a white boy outta the academy
I master beats, who could spit it after me?
So if your looking for the best bitch ask for me
I'm a youngster the next rap from the rug
Like bow wow if he was white and on drugs
And if his tracks didn't suck but they does
So I'm a be a whole lot better than he was
I'm buzzed, you'll know that he's bad
Like Amy Winehouse before the rehab
Poppin' 3 tabs, I'm mad like (doc Jekyll)
Bump up the base line and you know I rock treble
Number one hip hop rebel
You know what I meant, illest MC of European descent
