Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Full Steam Ahead"

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Peddle down to that floor, till the wheels don't spin no more
See me swervin', I'm fast and furious, hear that engine go roar
Speed is all that I know, buckle up and I go
When the light's not red, full steam ahead, go and pass me the microphone, and we yellin' out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)
In a hurry goin' a hundred and thirty until everything outside of my window is blurry, yellin' out out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, got Chloe and Kendall grippin' the head of my member lickin'
And suckin' until I'm bustin' all over they neck and dippin'
Like andale andale, cause I'm speedy with my exit mission
Gone before they even tell I'm missin', my Chevy whippin'
So fuckin' quick your vision can't manage getting recognition
And now your head is spinnin' like I'm practicing exorcism
So when I'm on the mic there ain't no way you could censor Christian
So many words would be cut you'd think your fuckin' antenna's missin'
Like Em and Tech were spittin', so check the rhythm
And bring it back just like the dead were risen with necromism
Because I shock em like they opted for the chair instead of prison
With my crew made up of closely assembled villains
You just a kennel kitten, stepping into a bigger pet division
I'm bred to sic em, so just let me off the leash and I'll effin' kill em
I'm blowin' up like I apprenticed in demolition
And now I'm all up on your television baby lets fuckin' get em
So run run now, go and hit the road jack
Hut one now, ready when I thrown that
Blackin' out on a beat like I'm takin' Prozac
Mixed with a bottle of cognac, call me Bojack
Cause I'm an animal and I'm so animated
Going green, so I'll get a Prius candy painted
Drivin' through your campus waving as the fans awaitin'
Followin' behind me from a cinematic angle till the camera's fadin', what
Buzzin' like I fuckin' suck at operation
Sorry sir I think there's been some minor complications
Vital signs flat line while your body's shakin'
That's when I lose my god damn patience (sir we've lost another one)
On a god damn rampage, leave em with a bandaid, fuck what the man say
Just a renegade getting handshakes, up and down the landscape
Do what I do to the death, get up out my damn way

Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)
In a hurry goin' a hundred and thirty until everything outside of my window is blurry, yellin' out out
Full steam ahead (full steam ahead)

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Yeah, all gas, no brakes on the pedal
This song sounds like rap mixed with heavy metal
Never settle, flow hot, I been screamin' like a kettle
In the city of the stars, pullin' strings like Geppetto
I saw the path and I went the opposite way
Middle fingers in the air when I respond to a lame
I was findin' my lane, and they defied what I claimed
Anything is possible, I'm just reminding my state
That anybody with a dream and work ethic can get it
All it takes is confidence and persistence
I calculated a plan I envisioned
Became the man in my city, took shots with precision
And now I can't stop with my writtens
My pen bleeds the truth, I every single sentence
Helped kids through addiction with the music I invented
Made a style and a voice, let everybody rent it
Windows tinted in that brand new Range
So when I say you can't see boy I mean what I say
Full steam like I'm cleanin' a tux
Award shows in my Chucks, not givin' a fuck

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Cause we, livin' it up, shit I'm fillin' my cup
I started with the minimum and now I'm triplin' up
I'm never quittin' till I'm sittin' on a million plus
I'm colder than reptilian blood, with a brilliant touch
Up on an instrumental, leave your noggin spinnin' like you Dizzy Devil
Hit the peddle, since I was eleven playing Twisted Metal
Cause the kid is friggin' mental, spittin' till I pop or rip a vessel in my neck while I whip a rental
I'm runnin' up the mileage, so much if I returned it they'd make me buy it
Auto pilot while riding the Iron Giant
Burnin' so much gas that I'm worried about the climate
Sorry for contributin' to the crisis, but I got my..
