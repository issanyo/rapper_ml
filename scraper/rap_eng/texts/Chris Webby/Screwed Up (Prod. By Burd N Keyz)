I've got my seat leaned back, keep my tires looking clean
Rolling with the baddest bitches that you ever seen
Always rock my brim low, cause we rolling up the green
Getting screwed up, you know what I mean, mean, mean, yeah!
Sipping on my drink, drink, fill another cup
And I'm rolling up the dank, dank, twist another dutch, dutch
Shawty what you think, think, we don't give a fuck!
Cause I’m always screwed, always screwed, always screwed up!
Let’s go!

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Back on the mic with the shit I say
We popping off!
And I've been going through at least a couple grams a day
Drinking up like mazel tov
Cause you know we gonna ball, young entrepreneur
My money long
If I start to run low, then I go back out on tour
Voila! Problem solved, no schedule
I just relax where the weed’s at, where my cheese stack cause I run this shit
I see that, then I need that
Hear me baby girl, get on your knee caps and suck my dick
About to relapse from the pills I get
Blue ones, white ones, purple too
(About to relapse from the pills I get)
And it puts me in the perfect mood!
Ooh, ooh, now I’m feeling too good to move
Everything I’m hearing is chopped and screwed
Pulling in my Chevy when I’m cruising through
Vroom! All black, from the tires to the rims to the paint to the tints
Fire when I spit, put the flame to your bitch when I’m lighting up a spliff
Then I came on her tits
Shit! See, Webby is a nasty dude with a raspy voice
Cause I burn so much, but my mom still proud
Every time I come around she like, "that’s my boy"
Get up on the beat and the track’s destroyed
It is what it is and it is what it be
Webster is the baddest boy!
And we getting screwed up, just follow me!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Get up on a beat like, “bitch, what’s up?”
Every single day I’m getting loose
I got a mixture in my solo cup
So loud, got a sub woofer tied to the roof
Rhyming the truth with a fine little sloot (Slut?)
Hitting more hoes than young Shia LaBeouf
Money on my mind, yeah, money on my mind
Trying to get some pesos on my grind for the loop
I’mma go get her, flow spitter, ho hitter
Surrounded by trees like gorillas
Webby cold to the bone, don't shiver
Made it this far, now I'm trying to go bigger!
Andre the giant, dropping the finest
Mix tapes, but the game cannot define it
Don’t know whether or not to co-sign it
Because I'm different, fuck if y'all like it!
B-B-B-B-bitch! Yeah, we be head tripping!
I’m about to lose my shit, wait til them meds kick in!
I’m a doberman pinscher, y'all just some wet kittens
My bitches look like models, yours look like Meg Griffin
Che-che-check out my cat skin, that shit says that I’m out of my mind
I’m just a mad man, rolling up like an ounce at a time
Hitting a club and I bounce with a dime
But only show up for a drink and a song or two
And now that I’m on, all you haters
Are mad I’m doing what I said I was gonna do!
