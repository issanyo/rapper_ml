[Verse 1]
Listen I’m just here to kick it regardless of if you’re with
Regardless of the critics getting all up in my business
Regardless of the fact that getting here took me a minute
In this game of life, chilling with my stand-by ticket
Goddamn I did it, I built the stage to get my voice heard on
And it’s real to say
Shit I’m still a normal dude, got bills to pay
And if tomorrow’s not promised I’ma chill today
Cause like you we all bleed red, we all human
We all just tryna navigate our way through the confusion
We all just want a piece of the pie
I’m staying zooted while I’m waiting
Let me roll up a doobie and keep it moving
I got a few chinks in my armor, too
Never used to see the world, now I’m starting to
And I’m just reaching for the motherfucking stars like you
Without a joint that shit’s hard to do
So I tell em that....

[Hook]
We all gonna die one day, so what?
But while I’m kicking I’ma have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
Cause when life gets tough I shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
And we all got bills to pay, so what?
But while I’m in the green I’ll have my middle fingers up
Yelling “fuck you”
And when shit gets rough I’ll shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Chilling, baking out my Chevy with my crew in the cut
I’ll roll a doobie and puff, I’ll roll a doobie and puff
Shrug it off and keep it moving
Roll a doobie and puff

[Verse 2]
I’m just out here tryna function
Bobbing and weaving through the percussion
While I’m puffing on a magic dragon daily like it’s nothing
As I watch my competition and proceed to one-up em
And if they don’t like what I’m doing then, man, fuck em
And if they ain’t been down since jump I can’t trust em
Ever since my friend ratted on me and I wound up cuffed
In the back of an undercover whip
Cause my homie couldn’t help but run his lip
As soon as the fan was hit with some fucking shit
But that’s life and I’ve learned how to choose my friends better
Learned how to master my craft and be a trendsetter
Learned how to get knocked down
Learned how to get back up
I learned how to rock these crowds
Learned to accept that what’s...
...going on is a blessing beyond a logical fact
I don’t know if God is real but someone’s watching my back
Maybe it’s my boy Nick, we still miss you cuz
Next joint’s for you, now roll up

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I’m gonna take a puff
Then I’ma blow it out
I’m gonna roll it up
And then I’ma burn it down

[Hook]
