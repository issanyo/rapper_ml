[Verse 1 Futuristic]
Yo, so i guess I'll smoke
So i guess I drink too
Free booze for the three dudes
Who creep through and freak booze
And they shirts is see-through
I speak truth and need booze gon' get clarke
Kent and superman in the mall
That nigga like tall bitches
With brown hair and titties that been augmented
Im all in it pants down shirts all vintage
That's a j- That's a jersey
My name ain't james but im worthy
Black guy who don't like Black Eyed Peas
But jeez do anything to get a piece of Fergie
Yall soft like Furbies
Yall sweet like Hershey's
My team is workin to get richer
So we can spend all this money
Do shows and travel the country
Smoke til we havin' the munchies
And fuck with thick bitches
I-I-I-I only smoke if imma eat a sandwhich
Or get some pussy
So I guess i mean i'm smoking every night
If i'm drunk nigga probably start a fight
Don't push me
Hi Rez in Hi-Definition
Hot bitches with thighs who got definition
I'm spittin like a nigga got a loogie finger
Fucking bitches in the movies
Bet her daddy probably wanna shoot me cuz i'm

[Chorus]
Livin' like a king
Not stoppin for a thing
Ain't nothin givin
Ive been livin' on the road
Livin out my dream
Chasin after green
And ive been sippin
So its movin kind of slow
We the last of the real
We the last of the real
We dont care how you feel
We dont care how you feel
We dont care how you feel
We the last of the real
We the last of the real
We the last of the real
We dont care how you feel
We dont care how you feel
We dont care how you feel

[Verse 2 Hi Rez]
I need a crazy pussy no Amanda Brynes
Bringin the dancing lobsters
Its all about the motherfucker secular trust
Word up to the never no Meet the Fockers
You ask beavis I get nothin but head
Jennifer Aniston I need you under my bed
With a couple friends
No pun intended
I'll be doing this til the day that im dead
Word up to courtney cox
I'll be pullin up in a foreign drop
And I'll be getting cake like im betty crocket
And I ball out like I'm fetty wap
I'm a 90's baby, finally famous
Doing a show fire aspects
Spend it all in Vegas
I'm a youngin in the game like Anthony Davis
Only care about my family
Give a fuck about a hater
Bumpin rock a model like just another night
Yo bitch she look like half of my girls
More like the right
I'm playin in a 64' with a couple whores
Conker bad fur day, Iâ€™m peeing all on the floor
And when my album in the store
You better cop it
Chillin' on the beach gettin fed it
I feel like a model rocket
Like half of these groupies give a pic of me
And they like it
I got hoes in Utah
We're the John Stockton


[Chorus]

[Verse 3 Chris Webby]
I'm the last of the Aaahh Real Monsters
Its in get the chrome when im gettin done
A pif in my lungs
Sippin with a strip on my tounge
Got a double shot of espresso
And cinnamon bun, I live on the run
With shows like every week
And on my stay CT Im the MVP
We deep like submarines in the 7 seas
And my future lookin brighter than an LED
My head where the rest at?
So tell them to step back
And the heavy weight belt
Im ready to get that
Can you rap into play?
Tryna get in my way?
Then imma turn the stage into celebrity death match
A rappers rapping a rap rapidly
Back to back when i attack a beat
So action packed to that capacity
When I smash it actually catastrophe
Pass the grass to meet Furturistic
And Hi Rez gon get the booze and bitches
I pick when i like if it be lookin real good
Shell be knockin on my wood like she superstitious
Im a super vicious MC
So let the elephant through
And ill step in the room
And dismember your crew
With the letters i drew
See for yourself on Webby's lab two
