Some people still speculate...
Is he really as nice as he says he is?

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, anytime I step I blaze it thoroughly
No one seein' me, y'all need corrective laser surgery
Check my date of birth you see, Webby's only 21
Hotter than the summer bitch, you know I got it covered son
Get it done when I get up on a beat and I tear it up
Cause all I got in this world is my word and a pair of nuts
Bring em in I'll air em out, hustlin' like Escobar
With lyrics sharper then the claws retracted in a leopard's paw
Check my repertoire cause I been grindin' for a minute
Heh, and even the haters admitted I can spit it
This rappin' is a sport to me, break it down importantly
Whiter than a kilo bitch, I'm bringin' Boston George with me
Ramblin' answerin' the hate and spit it gorgeously
Can't handle him I'm Anakin, and yes I got the force with me
Torture beats, have them all askin' where the chorus be
Bitch I'm good money and ain't nobody affordin' me
Playin' my cards right whiter than a Marb light
Voice raspier than Christian Bale in the Dark Knight
I got my competition sayin' Our Fathers
And every fuckin' hater runnin' scared like Paul Walker
I don't fire deadly shots, never with a semi cocked
Just light up headie pot and spit venom, call me Eddie Brock
Webby drops, whether you ready or not
Heavy metal or pop, so steadily I'll get to the top
Clever as ever so what, the bass and treble will not
So fuckin' loud its like gettin' hit in the head with a rock
I'll leave em dead or in shock, when I spit it I'm a rap rebel
With my size 10 Jordan on the fuckin' gas pedal
Grab the mic and I go
Ain't nobody messing with the rhythm I flow
Need that dough, Tic-tac-toe
Break mothafuckers like a Kit-Kat bro
Hit that dro, pass that back, layin' low, 20 sack
Then I roll it up and hit it till that shit's all ash
Then my drug dealer gonna get a call back
Back on a track accurate that's the reason I'm so relaxed when I rap
Cause the facts are the facts and the fact of it is
Next to Em nobody spit this crack
Bring it back, crowd packed, dog I'm rippin' more beats
Carrying the game just like a baby in a stork's beak
I'm servin' my competition like Roddick
I'm Doctor Robotnik, with knuckles in my pocket
Toxic, so fuckin' dirty you should wash it
Got this, hot shit, LeBron couldn't block it
Spittin' it with flavor, rippin' wisdom on the paper
Bitch I get the block hoppin' just like Tigger was my neighbor
Precision like a laser, no one playin' with this
Cause this rap is second nature like inhalin' a spliff
Then I throw together words and I rip shit ill
No one ever done like Christian will
Spit with skills, bitch this real
Brain slowed down on prescription pills
Need a deal, damn straight, make the fuckin' land shake
Ari Gold lookin' for me since he seen the fan base
YouTube, numbers up, Facebook, yeah what's up
All you do is Google me and haters keep they mouth shut
Now what, like a deer hunter all about bucks
If you tryna' to burn with me you'll need at least an ounce plus
It's in my nature I guess, I'm fuckin' meant for this
Ain't no type of censorship equipped for all my sentences
The booth is like my octagon, you don't wanna enter this
I'm Anderson Silva so step in here you're gettin' leveled quick
Poppin' stars and I'll be ravin' until I'm sober
I'm not afraid of shit, I'm as brave as the Little Toaster
Cocaine and some bakin' soda, I'm crack next up to bat
Griffy Junior to these losers, no ones fuckin' with the stats
Pupils fat and got a bag of molly in the pocket
I'm like Pikachu shovin' a metal fork into a socket
I'm electric, style eclectic, all these haters try to mock it
But spit so fuckin' flawless they can't help it but to jock it
Son I'll rock it, and now they all bloggin' about the hotness
Datpiff hot this week with a million comments
The big new thing, read about me in the comics
Under Hi and Lois rhymin' potent lyrics better watch it
Now I'm back and I rip it up and spit it so nice
Ain't nobody messin' with the poltergeist
Skin tone white, takin' flight
So far ahead that I'm out of sight
Down to fight, rip it on a mic
There never been a night that my pen don't write
There never been a night that I don't rap nice
When I'm on the right weed and rolled up tight
Hold that mic, get it in, who could ever mess with him
Sick go get some Levaquin, the medicine you get it then
Show em' I'm never settlin', fuckin' paper shredder em'
You wanna step? Then your chances are lookin' extra slim
Grindin' every day reachin' the top
And I'm only a step away, you don't believe me? Watch
I'm a beast on the mic, there's nobody left to help you
Cause bitch I'm nice, how many times I gotta tell you?

Damn man, fuck these haters, I'm out, ha
