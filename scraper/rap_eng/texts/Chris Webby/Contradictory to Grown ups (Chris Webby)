[Verse 1]
First of all shout to Chiddy Bang yo
But it’s Webby and I still be Off The Chain so
I’ll get your girl and do what you seeing on Bang Bros
Stacking YouTube hits like a double rainbow
So fresh, gotta Old Spice old feel
Tryna stay on course like a boat's keel
They wanna know how I be killing it with no deal
And got the game mapped out
Michael Scofield
No Prison Break
Get up here and renovate
Every venue that I’m hitting up in every state
Twist a zig-zag then I levitate
Webby been bad, Professor Snape
I’m like Manny Pacquiao times four
Hyping up the crowd when I’m out on tour
I need a dollar like I told you before
So I could cop an Arnold Palmer when I’m hitting the store
Encore
I used to pop pills always puffing bud
I think I’m still rolling, Team Pup-n-Suds
Now I’m going big time and I’m loving this
When I step in dudes better cuff your chick
I don’t speak game I say a couple words
Next thing you know we’re both under the comforter
In the comfort of my hotel suite
Having sloppy drunk sex and forget em by next week
I’m a beast repping Connecticut like a Husky
CT swag
Everybody here loves me
Got a stainless steel flow, never spit it rusty
Running shit like Nucky trust me
Name buzzing all over the fucking country
Shout to my ninjas and everybody who bumps me
So just feed me beats
I got the munchies
Nothing better than an instrumental when I’m hungry
The illest thing that ever hit pro tools
I’m 1-51, they just O'Doules
Live by no rules, no one’s stopping me
They say Webby rocks Geology
Even haters gotta bump my shit
So what thanks for the YouTube hits you dumb bitch
Put me in the mix, I’ma be the last spitting
I’m a tiger y’all domesticated cat kitten
You’ll get smacked kitten, left there with your cash missing
It’s a fact listen I’ll be on a track ripping
Haters crack jokes I just laugh with em
And get loud like Waka Flocka ad-libing
Spit venom out, every time I rap rhythms
Webby’s the deadliest catch
I’m going crab fishing
Teaching Hip-Hop: 101 so take notes
Bring it back mu'fucker I’m done

[Outro]
Yeah, Webby, murdering shit
It’s what I do, you now
Webby's Lab
Let’s go
