[Verse 1: Jitta On The Track]
So hitch hiked some nights and away I go
With a laptop midi and microphone
And I heard there's a place where the views much bigger
And the signs light up and there ain't no limits
Feel like it already, feel like I'm all ready
Give me one time for the music
There's only one life don't abuse it
Find yourself and then lose it
I wonder wonder what will change my life
I wonder wonder if I did not fight
I wonder wonder if it don't vibe right
I'll make sure that you go and spend yo' money
I got my team with me, they dream with me
They eat with me, that means they feast me
You gone' land the same way in a 360
Wanna smoke somewhere on the beach tipsy
Can't believe it's a dream, I'm so blessed I know
Yea, and away I go, I go

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jitta On The Track]
Cause I been California dreamin' (for so long)
Said love you momma but I'm leavin' (on my own)
Don't got too much in my pockets, one way ticket in my wallet
Send my love to everybody till I get back home
Said ohh you're gonna like it, ohh the lights are bright
And I can feel it comin', waitin' all my life
There's somethin' in the air, that got me feelin' right
The stars are on the ground, the vibe is in the night, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Yea, I think it's time that we hit the road
Bags packed to the brim, yo Jitt let's go
Takin' flight like Starfox 64
And peace out, to everybody who gone' miss me though
To a new time zone, better fix the watch
Cause it feels like 6 o'clock
At the after party, but I sipped a lot
So I'm losin' track, but it still don't stop
Cause we heard California was in a drought
But I think we got it all figured out
Made a quick pitstop at the In-N-Out
And then it's back to the studio that's in my house
Listen I been waiting for shot and the time is near
And the sun is high up, and the skies are clear
I'm a pioneer, and these stars on the sidewalk always gone' remind me of why I'm hear
With every step I take, it's everywhere we go to
Pocket full of dreams and a mic with Pro Tools
Givin' up's somethin' I won't do, like I'm doin' Sudoku
Got a whole lot of numbers to go through
Watching my expenses until I'm in the Benz's
And got the whole world on my friends list
Lookin' at my life through my Ray Ban lenses
Here to strike gold out west like I dreamt it, I been

California dreamin'
