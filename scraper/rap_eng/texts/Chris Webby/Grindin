[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah, I love girls, what's the matter with that?
And they like me back as a matter of fact
See em' at the bar, grabbin' a drink, give em' a wink
If she smiles, I'll be over there quick as an eye blinks
And I think you lookin' real sexy, yo
If you wanna hit the dance floor, let me know
I'm already thinkin' bout hittin' it, or lickin' it like licorice
Wishin' the predicament just changed into somethin' intimate
Your style, girl I'm diggin' it
She stay fly, and if she got the fresh kicks on I gotta say "hi"
I be, highly
Skilled with the rhythm, don't try me
Step up in the club, no I.D
Like I don't give a fuck that I'm 19
Find me at the bar doin' work
Lookin' for the girl here with the shortest skirt

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Now go back forth, right left, pull it
Push till you're running out of breath with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth, left right, grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Screamin' Ay Bay Bay in the club, so make way
Just had a pay day and need vajayjay
Okay? now y'all ain't ready for this
Girl so just stop, take a break real quick
Not smooth or slick but my game's still sick
I'll make Tila Tequila stick to the dick
Listen to this, Hip-hop song soon as I enter
First stop on the list, to the closest bartender
Checking on the list is to find me a chick
After I say what up to my peoples and drink a bit
Takin' shot after shot after shot after shot
If I got money, then why not?
I got lyrics and rhyme hot
I got the hottest bitches on campus on my- what?
Cause it's all about the sex man
Just jump on the dance floor and grind like the X-Games

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Now go back forth, right left
Pull it, push till you're running out of breath with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Back forth, left right, grab it
Tongue goin' at it all night with me
Stay grindin' on the dance floor
Stay grindin' on the dance floor

[Verse 3: Timothy]
By the time that you step in, I'm two steppin'
I rhyme with perfection, I grind with aggression
I'm from behind on the side in the section
Got it on her mind, but the grind's my profession
If she get blogded, cup a wine for refreshment
On the dance floor, tryin' to find a contestant
So try to find a contestant
What a shame, even if you're blonde, you're a freshman
Three of four options, never nothin' less than
Dimes, you will never find my dimension
Eights and nines and two or three sevens
And if you line 'em up it's booty meet heaven
Couple shots here and there, feelin' invincible
Mami over there and her rear's irresistible
I scored 3, and called it the hat-trick
And transitioned from the dance floor to my mattress

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Just grind with me
Yeah, grind with me
Yeah
Drop it to the floor
Girl, grind with me
Just grind with me
C'mon and grind with me
If you hustle on my rocket
And you grind with me
Now, grind with me
Cmon and grind with me
My sexy women and the bar
Just grind with me
Now grind with me
Get on your grind with me
Who can grind with me?
Now baby grind with me
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Stay on that grind, baby
Whether you got a bag full of dubs in your pocket
Or a fat ass baggin' all up on your shit
Stay grindin'
