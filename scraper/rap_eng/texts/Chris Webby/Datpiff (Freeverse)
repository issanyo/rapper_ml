Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Datpiff (Freeverse)"


[Intro]
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye yeah
Webbys lab..... 2
Na na na na na nana

[Verse 1]
I'm Vladamir and Vitali combined in the body of Rowdy Roddy and Colossus usin' karate
So get to movin' your body, see for you it's a hobby
But I've been dropping shit ever since I could poop on the potty
And it's prolly cause I just spent my whole life gettin' stared at
Weirdo with the raw rap goin' bare back
Can I give a fuck? Hmm, maybe, but I swear that..
You'll never see it like Donald Trump on a prayer mat...
While rockin' a turban and swervin' in a Ford Explorer
Bumpin' some reggaeton and helpin' people cross the border
See I'm just tryna do it for my peoples and supporters
Roll so mother fuckin' deep you'd think I'm breathing underwater
Cause see I'm like the author of this autobiography
They call me an oddity, it ain't my fault cause they'll probably
Pick apart my every lyric like a frog in biology
But I'll keep my stock high enough to stall the economy
As I jog through your property, while they tryin' to run it
Take off flyin' and plummet while Webby climb to the summit
Droppin' fire they love it, it's just a drop in the bucket
Only dude still on the mic without a quality budget
I mean fuck it, I rock crowds and I'm makin' my block proud
Even thought I'm still residing at my mom's house
Wait, wait.. Aren't I supposed to be on now?
Countin' my money from all the people that supported my songs now?
"Calm down Webby, I been bumpin' you on Spotify"
Well thanks for that, like, one thousandth of a dollar, guy
Maybe if you listen enough then I'll get like eighty cents
And be a step closer to gettin' me that Mercedes Benz
Fuck the latest trends, I'll do the opposite
I'mma do me, middle fingers to the politics
And EDM is all I'm hearin' from the college kids
Maybe I'm just gettin' older man, but it's obvious that..

[Hook]
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
A lot's changed since I first crashed Datpiff
I'm in the laboratory cookin' up a classic
Go and tell em Webby's back bitch

[Verse 2]
(Danger!) I run in screamin' like Mystikal, smoother criminal
Than Micheal mixed with Alien Ant Farm, the pivotal
Multi syllable killer my finger itchin' till triggers pull
Minions in the whip cause I'm mother fucking despicable
I'm sick of all these trivial rappers talkin' material possessions and financial status all up on my stereo
All I ever do is go hard, now it's gettin' physical
Until I'm breathin' hard as Seth Rogen doin' 27 miles on an elliptical
I'm not balling, I'm just lighting the bong till I'm coughing
Jamo poured till I'm crawling
If you steppin' to Chris, I'll leave your head on a stick
Like Ned Stark, I just gotta get a pencil and flip
Cause what I carry and wield, that shit's Valerian steel
And any second I'mma blow, call me Derek Forreal
So it's hickory dickory dock, lick on the tip of my cock
In the conversation I'm the pick of the litter to watch
Don't need a mixer, I don't order my shit on the rocks
All I need's a chalice with some whiskey that's filled to the top
The fuck has happened? One minute people rappin'
The next all I'm hearin' is adlibbing over tracks and
The planet is collapsing, economies are crashin'
And Hillary Clinton is dabbin', so I guess that..
