[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I love women, from Britney Spears to Marge Simpson
Just give me a rubber and you know that I'm goin' in son
Ain't no tee ball, but it's still easy to hit them
Cause I know what women want, call me Mel Gibson
Yes, cause they know we on next
They can throw me on set, watch em' go beyond sex
I ball hard but not in the Kobe context
I'm collectin' v-cards like a Pokemon deck
Muthafucka, cause I'mma speed to the top
Downin' a leader of scotch, cause like a demon I'm hot
White as a laundry load full of wife beaters and socks
Not even Ripley's is sure if they can believe it or not
Watch, I'll make 'em come to a dead stop
Cause on a beat, I'mma spit it hard as a pet rock
Baby girl, you know I'll make that bed hot
I'm no angel, my only Halo came with an Xbox
Drink till I"m walkin' like a waddlin' duck
But I can step a straight line just to follow a buck
I'm just looking for a chicken who can swallow a nut
Like a pecan pie in front of Jabba The Hutt
Wait what? and there is no way she could ignore me
Grabbin' on my Woody like Andy from Toy Story
With them lips like Topanga, I'll play the role of Cory
And sit back and watch you do your thing there shorty
Cause you know you can not start me
12 beers deep and I'm the life of the party
Bring a chick back and you know we gettin' naughty
Bite her so hard she be like "ouch Charlie!"
Cause you know we gets busy
Heads spinnin' like Taz so you know we get dizzy
Datpiff top 8 with Banks, Luda, and Drizzy
Sick as the swine flu, I been fuckin' Ms. Piggy
Really get silly, bitch you know this dude's nice
Mommy's comin' over and she's spendin' a few nights
Lyrics like an emo kid's pants, man too tight
Throwin' mad punches just like pudding in a food fight
Ha, so I'mma hit 'em with more bars
Cause I'm always needing me some M to the O-R
E mothafucka and you know that I go hard
I'm at the top of my game, I'll send you a post card
Bitch!
