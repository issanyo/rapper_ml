[Verse 1]
Lately I've been contemplating
Watching humans tear apart this fucking planet
Like they've never heard of moderation
The people running things ain't worried bout no conservation
Unless there's money in the conversation
But what happens when the soil is too toxic for the plants to grow
And all our drinking water is polluted (got the answer bro?)
All I know is humans are the cancer of the planet, yo
Forecast: lots of global warming with a chance of snow
Hoping things will change but I doubt they ever will
Mother nature dying while we yelling drill, baby drill
So in turn the world's heating up, climate change creeping up
Hell, at least those folks at Exxon made a decent buck
Carbon footprints on the world that'll never wash away
While the ones in charge of it ignoring what we got to say
Still we gotta try, all we got is you and I
Put your mother fucking fists in the sky, come and

[Hook]
Stand up, stand up, if you gonna fight for what you believe
Stand up, stand up, if you ain't falling for what they teaching
Stand up, stand up, if any time your back's up against the wall
Stand up, stand up, take away my freedom, you'll give me the reason to stand up!

[Verse 2]
I don't dabble much in things that are political
But it ain't hard to see
That half these politicians running shit are criminal
They way we written history is strictly fictitiously
Still they try tricking me, telling me that I'm living free
Now keeping quiet while they take away our freedoms
(Hell, they're just the constitutional laws, who fuckin' needs em?)
And the mainstream media decides what you'll be seeing
So I'm sceptical of everything, don't know what to believe in
Cause they lying to us right under our noses
And we know it but there's nothing we can do to control it
And it's got me losing sleep
Cause I'm seeing shit different than when I was younger
Watching world hunger while the economy's going under
Too caught up in reality shows and cell phones
Eatin' food full of GMO's to say
Yo! I've had enough of all these lies, all we got is you and I
Put your fucking fists up in the sky, come and

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See now we've got these countries beefin' with us
Like some World War III shit
Things about to change, you'd be blind not to see this
Civil unrest, the greatest country in the west
Bout' to crumble like the Roman Empire, nonetheless
Our oceans full of plastic, and the air is full of chemicals
Well, we let it happen like it's consensual
But fuck that
Educate yourselves and don't fall for what they been tellin'
Just tell them to throw there fist in the sky and start a rebellion!
