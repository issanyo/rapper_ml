[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yea, fuckin' world we live in man
Ain't nothing like you see
Everything you were taught
Throw that shit out the fuckin' window man
Yea!
God bless America, right? Yea, yea
See I got this microphone in my hand for a reason
Let me do my job

[Verse 1: Chis Webby]
At this point I feel exhausted
I can't trust the air I'm breathin'
Food I'm eatin', or the water from my faucet
Conspiracy theorist is what they call it
I just call it keepin' aware and being cautious
But the ones in office are handlin' business
It's all about the bottom line, cookin' the big fish
Control in the media, leaving the truth twisted
They feed us medication so everyone's indifferent
They keep us in the dark like we developing film now
Don't want a revolution, tearing all that they've built down
So they distracting us with Caitlyn and Kim now
Controlling the masses like they playin' the Sims now
We swallowing pills down because we were told to
The side effects got my mind a mess but its supposed to
Get rid of the anxiety, get rid of the pain too
And all of the while you can't see that it changed you
They scared us with Osama
Now they scare us with ISIS
So afraid that now we giving our rights up
Up in the Matrix with no one here to save us
I told myself there's still hope but really can't gauge it
Over in Asia the pollution is dangerous
Just to leave the house they wear a mask on their faces
Coastal community slippin' into the waves
It's lookin' like we just too late we won't make it
Unless we go and change shit ASAP
I say this shit and disregard the personal safety
Cause the NSA is gonna listen and take me
And make me seemed uninformed, wild and crazy
Just like they done to any artist with a fuckin' opinion
And just credit their character, if their stubborn they kill 'em
And I can't even see the stars in the sky for wishin'
When the small clouds form up and blind my vision
Trump or Hillary, ether way it sickens me
Those are my options? Are you fuckin' kidding me?
But the game is rigged you see and in favor of our misery
And the 1% is still getting richer and richer B
Everything is going extinct, but it don't stop at the zoo
Cause shit, we're animals too, we'll still be following suit
While the rich are getting paid and the poor stay broke
Why vote when I can load this automatic rifle?

[Outro: Chris Webby]
Watch the world on its downward spiral
Lost vote button down my bible
Til' the day we're loading up our rifles, fighting for survival, Waiting on that judgement day
That judgment day
That judgement day
That judgement day
That judgement day
