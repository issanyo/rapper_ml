Blunt lit, one hit, rip apart your lungs quick
Stoney Point crew and we always up to some shit
Yeah we always up to something
Keeping it one hundred, fucking up your function

[Verse 1] Demrick
Yeah we came in here to wreck shop
Rowdy like the pet shop
At The Green House puffing crops with the dreadlocks
Backwood out of head shop, filled with the best pot
We know the growers the ones that don't talk ‘cause the fans watch
He who thinks he can slow a man down
Best to be ready to go the last round
Hit your town, kill the show like Mask Down!
Bob Marley riches, yeah the type you can’t count
Valley [?] in the glass house
Smoking that San Fernando some can't handle and pass out. (I think he's dead!)
We ride crowds, while high above the clouds
You buy it by the eighth, boy, we buy it by the ounce
Kush called Stoney Point, dividing up the pounds
Providing you the sound, this is rising from the ground
And once it’s grown we ‘gon heal ‘em all
Just know the real involved
When you hear this song get up off the wall. (Woo!)

I was on mushrooms when I wrote this
And the thing is, I tried to micro-dose it
But now my vision's altered like a damn kaleidoscope, shit
I cannot control this, someone get the bowl lit!
...Now I'm feeling better
It's amazing what a hit of weed can do to change the weather in your mental
Yeah, you pleasure, put the puzzle back together anytime you fade up pieces and your life is under pressure
I just roll up a doobie feeling totally groovy
Only twist Raw's, you would think I'm rolling up sushi
Yeah I'm smoking like I'm slated ‘til I’m awkward and goofy
And got those nuggets that be sticky, yes the flow at the movies
We the Stoney Point Crew, see
Dizzy got that OG
Demrick got the best shit by the Oz
Mary Jane with me, I’ma never fear lonely
Hoppa bring the hook back homie
Yeah I got a

[Verse 3] Dizzy Wright
Figured out the meaning of life
Believe the hype
Now we see the world through social media sites
Spreading love but that don't mean you ’gon always get treated right
So come wit it, don't fumble
Humble opinion
'Cause them problem 'gon come
You better double your vision
Big dreams, you’ve got to be that one in a million
Always up to something
Fuck what they enforcing, ain't know who the fuck was coming
If what I think is important
I got ounces
The weed got them stuck but their heads keep bouncing
East side way up in the hills, by the mountains
Stoney point music off the bluetooth cruising
Bulletproof windows for the shooters like Koozma
One room, kill all of the platforms
Dizzy with us [?] but inner rap form
Never half-ass, if he fast then get the pass to 'em
DJ Hoppa to Demrick, he make the finish with the
