[Intro: Chris Webby & Anna Yvette]
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
Webby
There's nothing but blue skies (ohh)
Worked hard for this shit man
There's nothing but blue skies ahead right?
Huh
(Nothing but blue skies)

[Hook: Anna Yvette]
Down came the rain, to wash away the pain again
[?}
When I open my eyes, now there's nothing but blue skies
Down came the rain, to wash away the pain again
[?}
When I open my eyes, now there's nothing but blue skies

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
See I've been walking on this thin line
Trying to keep my mood right
Persevere through stormy weather
Cloudy in the moonlight
Sleepless for a few nights
Always kept my crew tight
Empty on the fuel light
Made it here on fumes
I been waiting on a sunny day
Sat there and I fucking pray
Went through ups and downs but knew I'd rise to fight another day
Gained a lot of battle scars
Held my ground like  Jaguar Paw
Charging at these matadors
Ain't stopping until I have it all
This game I'm in will steal your soul quicker than Shang Tsung
And change you some, but I won't forget where I came from
For all the kids living in middle-class America
Somebody needs to be the voice for us so I'm preparin' ya
Put it all on the line for the generation that I'm a-fucking-part of
With the heart of a lion out on the grind
Bitch, I came up being hated
Skill level always debated
Now I'm watching all the faces of the critics as I make it (Yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's been a struggle since you all have seen it firsthand
Deep into my work plan
Trying to make it work man
Reppin' for New England
Stompin' through the quick sand
Homie check my wing span
I will never hit land
So high in the atmosphere I'm looking down on planes
Got the blood of a champion in my veins
Motherfucker I've been stuck in the underground like the roots of a plant
And people doubted every move until I proved that I can
Shit, I command a fucking legion of my fans behind me
Labels scared to take a chance because they can't define me
Anybody steppin' better back off now (Step Off)
Make 'em hit the ground
Got 'em yelling "Black Hawk Down" (Huh)
My main concern is that it will always be the music
While these other so called rappers more concerned about their shoes
It's like a fight against the current
Fuck it, I'll do right
Grinding until I'm lookin up in
(Nothing but blue skies)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let's rise against the tide
Let's take a fuckin' stand
For all the non-believers show 'em that we fuckin' can
Competition ducked and ran
Fearin' their disruption
Cause whenever I was down I brushed it off and got back up
So whenever they try to tell you, that you won't amount to nothin'
Let it fuel the fuckin' fire and your soul will keep on comin'
Persistent till you get it
Push your body to the limit
Cause shit when you get your moment you best be ready to live it (huh)
So now it's bluer skies
And livin' super size
And shit can change in a second
This game is do or die
All I  can do is try
Never fearin' failure
Always keep it real that's why they feelin' it like Braille words
It's time to take my turn
And risk it all now
And I ain't got no safety net so if I fall now
This shit will kill me
So welcome to my true life
On the Edge Lookin up at
(Nothing But Blue Skies
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
