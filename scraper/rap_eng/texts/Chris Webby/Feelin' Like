[Verse 1]
I'm just trynna get my vibe right, trynna live that highlight
Twenty-twenty eyesight, focused on those five nights
If they ain't feeling it fuck it at least I tried right?
But at least I caught a little tan up on this lime light
At least I made through the game and got my soul intact
At least I made it out my motherfucking cul-de-sac
I started with a shitty hand but never folded back
Eyes on the roll, with no intentions on going back
Sticking to my guns like they bayonets up on this civil war
Kept it independent now the game is in a figure four
Cooking up this music leaving lyrics on a kitchen floor
Now I got the life that I was always wishing for
Let them hate this, 2015, now I'm on your little sister's playlist

[Bridge]
And it makes sense, I put it working for years
Now I'm crusing with no brakes in the path of greatness like

[Chorus]
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, I be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, Y'all be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh, We all be feeling like
Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, Oh-Oh-Oh

[Verse 2]
Vibe is so authentic everybody's pressing rewind
Flow is anabolic Webby never spit a weak rhyme
And they all gon' see I'm, higher than the tree line
Chill up in a cannabi' while throwing up a peace sign
Living like a hippie, what's the matter with that?
Nomadic habits ain't no telling where I'm travelling at
See this shit it ain't no average rap
Now I got the ball up in my court and I won't give it back till it's flat
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, I gotta represent
They know where I'm from from the second that I been stepping in
So let me get it in, check over my head and you gon' see a light bulb, bulb-bulb, Thomas Edison!
Time to take this! Cause victory is in my grass, I can motherfucking taste it!

[Bridge]
And it makes sense, I put it working for years
Now I'm crusing with no brakes in the path of greatness like

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm just trynna keep my head right, on this path that I must go (that I must go)
Only got one head light, as I travel on that road (travel on that road)
Everybody better recognize step aside and just watch the show (just watch the show)
And now we all be feeling live, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh!

[Chorus]

Yama! Pass the g my son!
