[Intro]
Yeah
You should've just not said shit bro
Why you gotta make me do this?

[Verse]
This muppet baby must be fuckin' crazy, now what's the hatin' about
You're the last person on Earth that should have my name in their mouth
Yeah, publicity is cool, but I'm not aimin' for clout
This for the love of the game that I'm gon' be takin' you out
See the utter disrespect that you've been showin' to the game
Should not be tolerated, I mean, really it's insane
First you shittin' on a legend, now you bringin' up my name
So, uh, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
That's real rap, so I'ma have this lil' clown wishin'
He never said shit to a dude who's about spittin'
This emo transgender is 'bout to be found missin'
You look like Chelsea Clinton with Down Syndrome
You're the kid at school that tested positive for lice
Hard to argue when I'm right, fuck your comments and your likes
You ain't rockin' any mics, fuckin' awkward little dyke
Cut your 15 minutes short with what I'm droppin' on sight
You were talkin' like you were the fuckin' man, Diego
But when I tweeted "Battle", you just ran, Diego, Goddamn, Diego
Thought you Cali cats were tough but you just bury your fuckin' head in the sand, Diego
Damn, 'cause once you realized you fucked with a sick spitter
You tucked your tail quick, gave up and just quit Twitter
I was gonna let it go but you went and ran that lip again
You forced my hand, you should never do that shit again
'Cause listen, you are like a cancer
To the game as a whole, I'm the answer
I'll make this little cry baby wet his Pampers
I smell pussy, is that you Xandra?
And it's clear to everyone on Twitter this shit is botherin' you
Your whole argument is your pop, and in that logic is true
But you've been here for like what, eight or nine months?
I've been here for a decade, I'm like a father to you
I see you're havin' a moment, but a moment'll never last
But you're young, you don't get it, I promise it'll pass
You ain't built to withstand the test of time
You're a fad, I'm a real MC with real rhymes
And I know that deep down this shit is eatin' you at night
You can't beat me on a mic, couldn't beat me in a fight
And since I don't have scribble scrabble tatted on my face
It's pretty safe to say I'm also beatin' you at life
How you think your face is gonna look in 20 years?
Like shit, I just want to make that fuckin' clear
When the world has forgotten you and your rap career
What you gonna do then, you little half-a-queer?
'Cause we all wanna see this sped lose
Xany listen, you're as likable as Ted Cruz
Cameraman turned rapper, I'm a rapper who's always been a rapper
Since you've been suckin' your mother's tit, I've been killin' rappers
What is you doing?
You look like a fuckin' Hot Topic store that evolved into a human
Abuse him, he's already playin' the victim because he's weak
Only bars he got are in his prescription
Why the fuck would you select me as an enemy?
Your whole team should've warned you not to mention me
Killin' people on the mic is like my specialty
What the fuck did you think? That I would let it be?
This lil' junkie's brain must be slowed down from drugs
With a bunch of yes men all around him 'cause
I'll fuckin' end you, Xan's runnin' out of luck
Every person on the web said your album sucks
You do one song with Diplo and think you're the shit, yo?
No one over 15 thinks that you're sick, bro
We think you're killin' rap and you're killin' yourselves
So seek help, 'cause those pills'll diminish your health
But shit man, if you don't wanna be alive, I won't force you
Here, I'll even crush a couple Percocets for you
Roll up the 20 and let you OD
This a war on drugs, one less Xan on the streets
Goddamn, let this be a lesson to the younger cats
Show respect, know your place, have some fuckin' class
Y'all can go and make your weird fuckin' mumble rap
But if you diss some legends, we won't tolerate your fuckin' trash
This a moment for the hip-hop heads
A reminder to the world that hip-hop's not dead
Yeah I'm puttin' on for the real rappers tonight
And pop a Lil' Xan like I'm try'na nap on a flight
Raw thoughts

[Outro]
Sorry about that, Diego
Ya know, this is what I do
Know your fuckin' place
Bye now
