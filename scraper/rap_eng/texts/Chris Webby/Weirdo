[Intro] Chris Webby & Miss Daja
Hey Ms. Daja... alotta people been tellin me I'm a weirdo
Really?... I get that alot too, I don't understand why
Well let's get weird on em then huh?
Ohhh less go

[Verse 1] Miss Daja
I like dancing in the dark
Drink when I'm drving my car
Spend all my money on clothes
Am I a weirdo?

Wear make up to go to bed
But I only sleep naked
Say anything in my head
Am I a weirdo?

I like to think of myself, as cool
But you gon' say wrong
Cause I'm not you
Put my hands up do you hang loose?
But you gon' say I'm wrong
Call me a weirdo

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

[Verse 2] Chris Webby
Ay yo wheres my adderall?
You see I'm weird it don't matter to me
Not being like you is what I happen to be
When I go I'm rappin a beat, I'm blazin shit
Because webby gets weird al yancovich

Uh all my sanity is stepped away
I wear ninja turtle tshirts everyday
I got cartoons tatted all over my whole body
Am I a weirdo... (duh) prolly

I got two pet turtles and a frog
A gravity bong and a fluffy white dog
Living in the attic in my parents house
I get drunk watching nickelodian on the couch

Transform running when I hear the beat
Even if strange is what I appear to be
I give true to myself and it's clear to see
That if your not a weirdo, then your weird to me

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo

[Verse 3] Chris Webby
I'm weird, bizarre, strange and different
All my weirdos stay and listen
Fittin in, I'm just not with it
Am who I am, and I love it live it
W-e-I-to the r-d
Am I normal? hardly
Nerdy, loser, stoner, artsy
Let's show em' weirdos are the life of the party

And I'm back to spit
Saying that I'm not normal is accurate
But I be normal to me, so just shut your lips
And if you don't like my style, suck my dick

I walk around in boxers half the day
I am a bum, who would care what I have to say
But they still press play
So you know what?
If you not a weirdo, you better step your game up WHAT?

[Hook] Miss Daja
Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh

Oh oh oh oh weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo
Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal
Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
