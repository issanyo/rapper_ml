[Hook]
We the illest around, and ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me
Burn this bitch to the ground, cause ain't nobody gon' see me
Ain't nobody gon' see me, ain't nobody gon' see me now

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You couldn't see me with your contacts in
Walk by, bitches yelling out like "Oh My God that's him!"
Mwahaha, so come here you little groupie
That's why I'm always chillin' with a bird like Snoopy
I got my wood stocked, I am rappin' cooked rock
Spitting crack, bring it back, doing things you could not
Burn a bag of good pot, let it lean, let it rock
CT, where you at, got my region on lock
Beam me up, Spock, to the top of this
Can't see me, see a fuckin' optometrist
I show dominance, you better grab your bifocals
Then you see me kill it with the vocals, local
Hometown hero got the internet buzzing like a vibrator
Haters see you later, no discussion
Got percussion in my bloodline, music in my heartbeat
Money in my mind, Steve Nash couldn't guard me
Hardly famous, well maybe on Facebook
Friend request healthy ass every single day, look
Rap's Dane Cook, one liners got 'em shook
Fly as Peter Pan man, but I'm a captain like Hook
Rap and I took everything that is around you
Leave 'em looking like a damn Velicoraptor found you
Simply, sickly, somebody hit me
So cool I'm frozen in time like Walt Disney
Drink til I'm dizzy, and steadily burning
Anybody dumb enough to battle Webby will learn
That they can step in and step out, meeting adjourned
Ask Rafiki he'll tell you that the king has returned

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Googie GoHard]
It's Googie GoHard and I came to bless the track
Grooving with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Rapper
We chopping who can not see, an Inglorious Bastard
The flow has been mastered, I'll even spit it backwards
You don't want the raw meats, you don't want the raw eat
You don't wanna spark too many punches in the raps
Homie you ain't on my level anyway you spelling that
It's a tad in the bag from the gift of the gab
Ah man, this kid is unbelievable
Even B.I.G. woulda say I'm something he ain't seen before
He would blow, speaking shows, scheming when I'm even low
I ain't tryna battle homie, I'm just tryna see the dough
Nah, it ain't conceited yo, maybe just a little bit
Hope you got binoculars, and if you do then riddle me this
How you gon' see something that you know yourself don't even exist
I lickety Split, now go to the middle and watch me just fill it with piff
Can't see, Webby or Googie GoHard
You can't see us, how you gon' see
I'mso mean in my B-Boy lean
You're gonna need a telescope to see these stars gleam
CT all the way to the dirty Jersey
Yeah muhfucka, you heard me
We burn trees like arsonists, you don't wanna bark to this
Can't see the flow then you better get your goggles bitch

[Hook]
