Mirrors on the ceiling (on the ceiling) the pink champagne on ice (champagne on ice)
And she said, “We are all just prisoners here, (just prisoners here) of our own device (Of our own device)."
In the master’s chambers, (In the master’s chambers) they gather for the feast (they gather for the feast)
They stab it with they’re Steely knives (They stabbed it with they're Steely knives)
But they just can’t kill the beast (just can’t kill the beast)

[Hook]
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(Yeah, its Chris Webby They can't stop me)
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(I work too hard for this shit. Too damn hard)
Just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the, just can’t kill the beast
(Let me tell you bout it real quick.)
They stab it with their Steely knives but they just can’t kill the beast

[Verse 1]
Yeah yeah I could of just been stop by what arisen in the past
Sitting in the county cell only two years back
Waiting on a phone call from my girl or dad or my mother
As they try to gather together all the cash to bail me out
And I'm embarrassed for that cuz it was my stupidity that got this felony rap
And now they had to suffer cuz of me and I'm sorry for that
But now the coast is clear and they ain't never sending me back
I was left with fucking nothing not a dollar to my name
Left with a pen left with a pad left with dream it's all the same
While I'm thinking I was looking at three and half years
Still I never shed a tear I got on the grind with an idea
To be great to make something outta my life and just redeem myself
Enough with all the tough talk and shit Webby be yourself
Work for it everyday put lyrics to these beats now they just can't kill the beast. Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was stuck living in my parent's house working a 9 to 5
Waking up for court at the crack of dawn and loosen up my tie
Waiting for my paycheck in the mail even though it was low
How the fuck else could I pay for the studio? Cuz I know
Even back then that I would make it rapping
Its all I ever thought about so I knew that it would happen
It had to be so gradually put my soul in this music shit
If you don't think I worked ever second for it you stupid bitch
I remember performing in ten people show
But still I put my fucking heart in it even though
It seemed I would never make it every one told me I'd never make it
But I had determination and I never let nobody brake it
I was set on being famous I was ready for the anguish
That goes into being something that requires mental patience
I grinded and I grinded so everybody would listen
So while I got your ear I'd like to introduce you to Christian

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Went though a bunch of situations leading me to dead ends
But I kept the microphone with me just like my best friend
After lots of bullshit I sat back home
And said "Fuck it" Im'a do this shit all on my own
Got a strong team behind and we went the independent route
Stepped my lyrics up while my competitors are stepping out
Of my way cuz I'm here to stay paving the way every fucking syllable
ThatI say, I'mma make my way to my dying day Im'a be okay
I've been booed at and taunted and hated through all this
I've kept my fucking head up now it me that they be wanting
I've earned this I worked to fucking hard to tell me otherwise
I've made a fucking movement yo I'm not like all these other guys
I was born for this fuck what all the hater said
Any talk about me being fake has now been laid to rest
Took the long road making it eventually
So fuck a mixtape this is me fulfilling destiny

Mirrors on the ceiling (on the ceiling) the pink champagne on ice (champagne on ice)

In the master’s chambers, (In the master’s chambers) they gather for the feast (they gather for the feast)
They stab it with they’re Steely knives (They stabbed it with they're Steely knives)
But they just can’t kill the beast (just can’t kill the beast)
