Read Chris Webby's Explanation "Ignition"

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Yeah
You lookin' bad woman
Head to toe, had to let you know from your facial features to your ass woman
This woman, that woman, Catwoman
Scratchin' my back and my abdomen
I don't brag to 'em, I just be tellin' 'em how I'm livin'
Like em full grown, ain't messin' around with the kittens
New car smell but already test driven
And I do it like my whip and put the key in the ignition, drop
Imma do it now, goin' stupid now
Got a cougar in the Uber now, ya the rumors out
Backin' it up like I'm Juvenile
Got ‘em movin’ now
Ya I know I'm kinda new in town
They like who an' how
From the bed to the couch, shit
Make the couch flip
Every room up in the house, shit
And she down with goin' until the sweat drip
Workin' out shit
In that pussy till it purrs baby
Call me Meow Mix, yeah

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I just get it how I'm livin'
Cougar sittin' shotty like I'm Ricky Bobby whippin'
See the similarities of vehicles and women
Cause I get that shit purrin' when the keys in the ignition
Like, like *purring noise* when the keys in the ignition
I get that shit purrin' when the keys in the ignition
See the similarities of vehicles and women
Cougar sitting shotty with the key in the ignition, like

Uh, got a bitch from out the country
I only get to visit monthly
She said she want me
Cristal sippers begets hard denim
As soon as I slide got em feelin like god
And I'm emaculate  with the packagin'
Told me she like 36
Not a BBW, but she curvy, thick
I got a early flight, know I gotta rise up
Feeling faded like Nas, cut your times up
She like lobster, I like my steak prime cut
Tom Ford everything could never get his grind up
She got the foreign whip, condo in Soho
I come around she take her ring off, on the low though
I'm in this other's chick city, doing promo
Instagram I had shit hot, don't take no photos
I'm in the drop with the AC off
Got a cougar on my line tryna taste this sauce, it's A1

I'm the cracker with the flavor you ain't seen since town house
Rips with the cheese when I breeze through your town now
Steez with the ease so please
I already got a plate of sword fish waitin' for me at the tele
So just call me when you need some
Throw on Netflix and we fuckin' through the reruns
Yeah, let me breath some
See we banging and she blow my money, baby that's a threesome
They askin' if I'm a kid or not, shit I'm hot
Throwing competition in the litter box
And while you're messing with those little thots
I just sit and watch
And shake the planet till I sit on top
And I don't care if you got kids or not
As long as the shit is tight
Get a baby sitter, come and spend the night
I'm just a different type than your normal tinder swipe
Sayin' hello kitty and get up in it right
