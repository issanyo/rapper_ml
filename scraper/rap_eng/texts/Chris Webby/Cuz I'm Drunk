[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I get rowdy, rough, drunk, excited and amped
On the table all night, I'm the beer pong champ
Drink until my mothafuckin’ liver gets cramps
And I've lost everything within the pockets of my pants
Like, “Shit where's my phone? Keys? Shit, who has my wallet?”
“Dude, you probably lost it, you stupid alcoholic”
Ha, fuck you bitch, I weigh 160
So it only takes a few shots to get myself tipsy
A few more then I'm drunk, then I move on to wasted
Then black out, find me passed out on the pavement
Slurring every statement, vision getting blurry
Sippin’ 40's from four-forty to two-thirty
I'm dirty, plus I ball like Michael
Get wasted like plastic that isn't recycled
I'm too fly, rhymin’ it nice
So drunk I could get a DUI on a bike
Mix up the lime with a little coconut
Takin’ shots outta half-filled solo cups
Get smashed like dropped pottery
Probably couldn't walk a straight line If I had a fuckin’ cop watchin’ me
Walkin’ into shit like I couldn't avoid it
Just lookin’ for a girl, tryna’ make some poor choices
But whether I get laid or end up in a brawl
I just blame it on the a-a-alcohol

[Hook]
Cuz I'm drunk
So do not play around with me cuz I'm drunk
Somebody take away my keys cuz I'm drunk
Shit I can barely even see
I think it's time to make some bad decisions cuz I’m drunk

[Verse 2: Mic Galper]
I come through already blunted like flip cup, who want it?
Twenty on the table son, I'm about to make a hundred
You can make it rain but I'm 'bout to make it sunny
That means I keep my money, buddy I'm not a dummy
“Day and Night” it's the kid, lookin’ for some Cudi
Got my homie Chris Webby to make sure she ain't chubby
Cause I drank a lot of bubbly, in the living room stumblin’
Everybody lookin' lovely but I came here for the pussy
I love to start beef son I can't control it
Might wake up with missin’ teeth like The Hangover
I might wake up with a naked slut from Angola
I don't know bro, I'm just saying I ain't stayin’ sober
So move over 'fore this fat bitch puts roofies in my cola
Cool that's what I wanted wrestling sumo with polar
Bear, beware when it's time to go upstairs
Fuck a Trojan, got socks make sure you wear a pair

[Hook]
