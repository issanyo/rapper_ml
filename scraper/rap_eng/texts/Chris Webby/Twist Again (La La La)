[Verse 1]
See
We been on that La La La since '08, combine strains and taste
LeBron James of vaping, volcano blazing bongs with no breaks
Edibles on plates till I'm beyond baked
And I be on, indica got me gone
Got that wax that you can't feel your body on
Yeah that shit that you moving slow is a zombie on
High as a cosmonaut never gon catch me not smoking
The best hit my chest and I take the whole rip
Fuck a 20 bag I'll take the whole zip
Even if the federal government oppose it
I say fuck it and grab another nugget and puff it in public
Weed naps on my back like a Snorlax
Highest alien, bouncing off of the ceiling
I need it up in my system the minute that I record that
Loud packed in a Raw wrap
Yeah

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So lets twist again, until we learn to fly
Yeah, let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)

[Verse 2]
Still rollin' to the diner with my half off coupon
Bacon grilled cheese and you know I get my soup on
Still up on that Jimmy Neutron, got the boost on
In my spaceship, lean back in a futon
Whoa, even when I'm seeing the cops
I chief pot, whether they gon' make it legal or not
'Cause see I smoke for recreation before it was recreational
Take a pull, now the euphoria is undebatable
My terpene so aromatic
Yeah, you can smell it from my parents attic
To the basement 'til they say, "Chris, light an incense
Or use some of that spray shit
Fuck, I can't take this! For Christ sake
You're 28, give me a break!" (Alright mom)
Then I go back to gettin' baked
Higher than Towelie up on a balcony
And smoking hourly and burning the Sour D like a calorie

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So let's twist again, until we learn to fly
Yeah, let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)

[Verse 3]
When that wax pen is in action
And the smoke fill the room like Mad Men
With those hash blends, I'm like Captain
Kirk, when I get the purp I am blastin'
Off, 'til I'm lost in the stars, never come down
Light my blunts with the sun now
Snuffin' out the bud like a blood hound
I'm chemically imbalanced, roll a doobie and I puff now
So I'm sayin', "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
Say, "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
Yeah, "Who got the lighter? Who got the lighter?"
No, for real, who got my fuckin' lighter?
I need that fire from the Bic just to calm me
And the chronic goes so strong
Hoodie smelling like it's Snoop Dogg's laundry
Twist like Chubby Checker
There's nothing better on God's green
Roll the palm trees and I'm gone, peace

[Chorus]
Let's twist again, like we did last summer
Let's twist again, until we all get high
I still remember when "I got the weed mans number"
So lets twist again, 'til we learn to fly
Yeah, Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
Let's twist again
(la la la la la la la)
