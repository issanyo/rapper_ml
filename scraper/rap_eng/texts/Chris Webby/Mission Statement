[Intro]:
Yeah, Webster
See I've been quiet for a minute, now these bitches think that I lost my sound
Everybody chill, I've been getting my business off the ground
Finally successful, but to you that means I sold out?
Well fuck it so let's remind these people that there's really no doubt
Webby's still the beast that he's always been, and I rap hard
So check my wifi signal yo, I still got mad bars
Whippin' like it's NASCAR, still no one can touch me
All you pound puppies never stepping to a husky
Repping for Connecticut, stomping on you midgets
Smoking weed, taking pills, fuck it where the whipits?
No one can ever do it like I did it
Spit so big you gotta right click it, scroll down and zip it
I'm Santa Claus's misfit rolling with a thick bitch
Rappers out here ollieing, me I triple kick flip
Murder any beat and leave the listeners to witness
Jason Statham even scared to put my name up on his hit list
I watch these record labels all assemble the full
Rise terrible rappers whose skill levels is questionable
They have a hit single or two and disappear into obscurity
Me? I paid my dues that's why these motherfuckers heard of me
Haters getting madder now, wishing I would beat it
All because I fucked they girl on the top of my Tempur-Pedic
Sprinkle sugar on the Bible, sweet Jesus
Punchline pros leaving rappers with they teeth chipped
Webby been a genius, like I told 'em previous
Usuain Bolt on the track can't compete with this
The state of hip hop now is straight tragic
Turn the radio on, what do you know- some more wack shit
Except for a select few, because if your nice, then your nice
Got bars? Salute, I respect you
Cause half of these cats raping these days are from a test tube
A puppet to the label that they're soon to be in debt to
Me? I'm fucking meant for this
Downloaded and rendered it
Really in the game now, I'm through with my apprentice shit
Kids these days don't even listen to the sentences
They bumping Gucci but don't know who Jimi Hendrix is
Cranking Drake songs while they're cruising in their mom's jeep
But never heard of Big L, Rakim, or Mobb Deep (fuck that)
That's why I'm here to spit crack
Kids blowing up without paying homage to the legends, I ain't with that
This shit is crazy man, it's depressing really
The game is smoke & mirrors never let deception get me
I keep my guard up so if they come and step to Chris
These wannabe rappers about to get ate like it's 7:50
Nobodies diss me? Fuck so what?
They just want me to use their name so that their buzz goes up
So keep yapping it, pretending we got personal beef
Like I'm gonna lose sleep? Shit I never even heard of you B
We took some BIG and some Pac and mixed it up in a pot
And Eminem is what we got so is it really a shock
That another Caucasian rapper sticks out of the flock
That's got the lyrical capacity to level a block
I'm still chilling playing Nintendo
Faded off the Benzos
Fucking these hoes, you just stuck up in the friend- zone
Your girl texting me, ending with an XO
Fuck your Emojis, let me see them breasts yo
I'm Lou Ferrigno, about to Hulk smash this
Webby the pick of the letter like digging for cat shit
Trying be a rapper now a days is on some fad shit
Youngins' getting tatted hopin' they'll be in them mad kicks
Thinking all you have to do is learn a couple rap tricks
Buy some snapbacks and mad kicks to get your swag sick
Make a Youtube account, voil√† that's it
The next big thing overnight like magic
But Katniss only the strong survive here
Listen dear, like the Hunger Games every single year
People rise to the occasion or they fumble it's clear
The only guarantee is that you'll see the death of a some careers
Been on my underdog shit for awhile
No more white kids keep popping up jocking my style
Then I'm still unsigned
Staying hungry on the grind
Now i'v been rapping along with the fans I gotta been alive now
Lie down cuz I'll be coming for you if you steppin to me
It's my time now
You cannot interfere with this shit it was destined to be
Reppin' the C.T. New England shit
Tri- state too we bring it bitch
Stuck within this game when most people would rather sing than spit
Can you believe this shit? The game is fucked man
Cause all these people only in it for the buck man
Another mixtape, all are free
Because when Webby's in the booth you know it's bars on me
