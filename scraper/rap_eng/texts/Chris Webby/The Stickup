[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Na-na-nah hold the phone
All those years I rode alone
Weight of the world on my shoulder bones
(knock-knock-knock-knock-knock)
But it feels like no one's home
I been on the same shit (on the same shit)
Going through these changes (through these changes)
But I haven't seen a change-up on my credit statements
Everyone walked all over me (all over me)
And I let 'em
Let the wrong people get close to me (get close to me)
But I learned my lesson
And they left me here with these broken dreams (with these broken dreams)
So I swept 'em
And this dustpan in my one hand
While the other one's grippin' a weapon
Through the depression, self-reflection
Poor training, and misdirection
From coaches I put my trust in
But fuck 'em I'll never sweat 'em
I promise I'll never let you
Pass the position I currently live in
I'm lapping you in my sweatsuit
Hand the baton right over the line
I'm leaving this bitch with a medal (with a medal)
I want gold, silver, yeah all of that
In that back room with that black mask
I'll take that
Yeah, ASAP
Don't make a move, don't say shit
Just lay flat, cooperate and this'll only take a minute (only take a minute)
That's just the cost of winning (ha-ha)

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
I-I-I-I been feeling stalled out
Hit home runs and I fouled out
Been broke as hell and I balled out (true)
Conditioned to run that long route
Got the stamina and endurance (yeah)
To handle any occurrence
From the showtimes to the low times
My skill set's my insurance (oooh)
I won't back down and I won't run (nah)
Unless we talkin' bout the track
Even Yoda said I'm that Rogue One
When The Empire Strikes Back
I'ma just snap (I'ma just snap)
This is the warm-up (this is the warm-up)
Put the team on my back (on my back)
Technique and my form up
Believe when I warn ya
Fillin' up my bag, I
Came to empty your stash spot
Put the key in that padlock
You got five minutes and that clock's tickin'
Don't be a hero, don't fidget or move
I'm not really in the mood
'Cause I came here to take everything and that's exactly what I'm gon' do
No fucks given, no competition, nah
No I won't lose
Can't fuck with him, my intuition is
From a third-eye view (ye-yeah)
Don't feel the same, my feelings changed
My adversaries gon' feel the pain
When they tune in and they hear my name
On that broadcast when I steal the game (bang)

[Chorus: Skrizzly Adams]
See, time goes by, but I swear that it's stalling
I've had it all, but it all just feels the same
No lie, I've been praying for the calling
Chips all in
Steal the game
Steal the game
