[Intro-Chris Webby]
Yeah
Webby
It's that shit you just roll to, you know what I'm sayin'?
Hop in a whip and roll

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 1-Chris Webby]
Still like a kid but I'm newly 22 though
They know me as the chew from CT to Pluto
Walk around town, everybody givin' kudos
Michael Cera didn't hit it, I'm the one who banged Juno
I live life mucho bueno smash culo
Shows every week since I linked up with New York
Now I'm on that new flow
Doin' what I do bro
Buzz gettin' bigger than an uncut jewfro
Who knows I would achieve on this level
And prove my teachers wrong cause they said I was a rebel
Who never would amount to nothin' doin' what I want
Always showin' up to class smellin' like a fresh blunt
But I always had it in me, I just needed to apply myself
And rap's all I've ever loved, besides myself, huh
Maybe I'm a little cocky dude
But if you spit this tight then you'd be cocky too

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 2-Chris Webby]
I roll, roll like a Michelin
Everyday I get it in
Pop another ritalin, listenin'
I was a goofball, never the sober guy
Gettin' high, rollin' up J's playin' Golden Eye
Star Fox in a ship facin' Andross
Zelda, Ganondorf in a standoff
Battlin' with Bowser, fireball flower
Sittin' in front of my TV for hours
And though you grow up you still hang on to the past
Being young was a blast and you clean up your act
And try to make somethin' of it, don't listen to the haters
And if you got a passion, then you follow it if you love it
That's what I did and shit I'm alright
Still livin' with my parents but I'm livin' the life
I be wakin' up late, and I party all night
Cause I'm doin' what I love and the future looks bright

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll

[Verse 3-Chris Webby]
You can find me eatin' bacon grilled cheese with my grape juice
Donkey Kong in the flesh like the ape loose
Yeah that's fuckin' right, I could snuff a mic
Since I rode my dirty black and white rusted Huffy bike
Soon enough I'm in a two door drop
With a stack of money greener then a newport box
So I dare you to go and find a dude more hot
Buzzin' CT so big I made New York watch
Now everybody be recitin' all my raspy quotes
Of the skinny white boy with a scratchy throat
Now my mixtapes, everybody has it
Cuz in your iTunes got more Web than your attic does
Get it? Just nod if you follow me
You don't gotta like it, but if not just acknowledge me
I got an army of ninjas across the US
And I'm just doin' what I do best
Haha

[Hook-Chris Webby]
Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me
I ain't lookin' back
Still a kid at heart, ain't nobody changin' that
Got my mind on my money, but I still don't have a stack
I roll, I roll
Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at?
One day I'mma make it, so I wait until it's that
And when I get my turn, swear to god that it's a wrap
I roll, I roll
