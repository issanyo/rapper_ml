I said we're on Cloud 9
It's where you wanna be
Ciroc and lemonade and, a splash of Hennessy
The club don't close, the drinks gonna flow
We get it where we fit in, ain't nobody gotta know
I said we on cloud 9
It's where you wanna be
I take a look at you, you can take a look at me
Clothes fall off, we floating in the air
We do it how we do it get it and nothing compares
Said we're on cloud nine

[Verse1: Wrekonize]
Crack open a capsule, and pass me the Paxil
Feelin' like a chemical imbalance
She always said I had talent
But I never had the balance to be sippin'
And I'm drinking in the gallons
Bitch never seem to get I'm Richie Valens
Fly til I die, sky high madam
Digging in the life till I'm the dirt up in the talons
I'm always gonna bagging since school pant sagging
Bad bin in the bottom of a cup and
Nobody can never tell him  what the health risks are
Benton and the Â¡MAYDAY! motherfuckers
Are basically coming up to get the hell up outa dodge
Call me Hell Boy, satancy
Rap like, for others it ain't safe to breathe
Give me all the goods and counting get me paper please
I be hittin' cloud nine with a strange disease
Some call it dope, some call it ill
I just call it whatever I'm feeling in the middle of the moment
Everything I do I own it so when I'm calm
Nah pick my body up and serve it in the (Mooma?)
Doing Molly when wildin' with Mona, Lisa
Leaks the seat to you when I zone off
Heaps of frequent feats we need the loaner
Probably wonder how I think I need me a Corona
And Miami with the women are the type that wanna take your soul
Just keep your guard up high and alive, don't be running 'round alone
We got nothing but some time and the rhyme for the crowds we know
Give me a fat ass, ounce indigo to the clouds we go

[Verse2: Bernz?]
Man... What the fuck?
Is everybody in here high? (Tell the truth)
I know you are, you are, and she is
And motherfucker so am I
It's alright, tap the bottle and twist it right
Take it down, turn it up for the night
One time for the monkey on my back
He's got a fucking addiction to that jack
Along with that high grade, I'm flying bae
If I leave too much don't bother me
I got a strobe light point it in my eye
With the future playing loose inside my mind
So surfs up motherfucker, I'm wavy
One to the head, two for my ladies
This game Boulevard looking like its Ozz
And I'm Tony Montana in the 80s
These girls with ropes they choke us all when I provoke
I seen episodes of that show
Control my high and fly straight, the Tri-state
The sun raise, not comatose, so lift off
I'm lost, my face is numb the clothes get ripped off
In the motel, they call it air barrage with a private dance
And shake an ass in a thong, and it's on
Got a stash that will last all weekend
And a bitch with me ready for the freaking
My room's reaking, but I don't give a shit
Cause I'm lit and I'm feeling so decent
Ripped from a piece on that ganj for relief
Only the best [?] go through a bloodstream
Everybody need a time just for relief

[Jarren benton]
Fuck cloud nine bitch I float on 17
Cigarillo filled with weed, a cup of promethazine
Kill a mothafucka put his head in a guillotine
Black tar heroin it came from the Philippines
Eddie Cane nigga doin' coke in a limousine
This shit'll blow a niggas face to smithereens
3 weeks clean, relapsed I'm still a feind
Heaven in a bag and it's wrapped in cellophane
You can see the high in my iris
Best of both worlds bitch Miley Cyrus
Hit a nigga hard like a fiery virus
Brain dead can I feel a pulse in my wrist
Huff glue, sniff paint cans, and nitrous
Smoke more dope than them boys in Cyprus
Hill, in Ireland [?] with the Irish
Crush it up, sniff it baby girl now try this
My homeboy cook it in the kitchen
They be like, "Jarren dawg, you need an intervention"
The shit that I be on will have you outta this dimension
When you touch back to earth ya have ya fuckin' brain missin'
12 pack of them PBRahs
Is a nigga dead? you know CPRah?
Break inside ya fuckin momma house took a couple diamond rings, TVs, and a VCRahs
Jesus, I need help, life in the fast lane, arrive with no seatbelt
Let the fuckin heat melt
Every single gram in the bong
Inhale, exhale, loud pack take a deep smell
Drug abusin'
Stuck here on Mars someone get me Houston
Hope it ain't too soon, but damn a nigga gone off the same dope that fucked up Whitney Houston

[Chris webby]
I'm on drugs!
I don't care to mention
All I know is me, MAYDAY!, and Jarren Benton
On cloud 9 flying through the air ascending
Til my family and friends throw an intervention
Uh, we be doin' this
In a goddamn cumulus
We don't need jet, blue ya bitch
We lookin' down at the moon and shit
You don't have to like me (I don't give two shits!)
Kiss my ass and bite me
Stay fucked up poppin' caps all nightly
Up on cloud 9 fuckin' Aphrodite
Go so hard Imma need 2 turns
And we don't give a fuck about the weed you burn
Cuz we got so much that we stay surrounded by the green Like a guest in between 2 ferns (Cloud Nine)
Single chicks [?] clothing
And the rainfall consists of beer and codeine
Living life like a young Hunter S. Thompson
And this a re-enactment of fear and loathing
Phone says "roaming" and I'm very
Lost in the clouds yo, I don't care B
(Take another shot?) you don't gotta double dare me
Nah, Nah, you ain't gotta double dare me
Yea man I'm blowin' up
Sippin out my solo cup
Ever since my first blunt
Webby's never sobered up
Light one up let down yo hair
Cuz up here ain't nobody gone care
Up and away so fuck it I see you up there!
