[Excerpt: From the T.V. series Breaking Bad]
[Hank] "I don't know who you are. I don't even know who I'm talking to."

[Walt] "If that's true, if you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly."

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Listen bitch better tread lightly, I put 'em to bed nightly
Shit, you'll never see me tired and losin' is less likely (yea)
I got the haters mad 'cause they chick is my next wifey
(Keep talking) I don't care if i got your respect, bite me (fuck off)
Y'all think that people up in Connecticut can't rap
Well just watch as me and Ap go and put an end to that
While these other rappers countin' they chickens before they hatch (fuck it)
I said fuck it, and made 'em over easy with some hash
(Oh My God he's on the drugs again, holy fuck!) Urine so dirty
Only at my local deli am I going cold turkey
So much musical knowledge they askin' if I went to Berklee
Leaving third degree burns on the microphone until they heard me
I roll around with eighteen birdies and I ain't playin' golf
Just them Kit-Kat bitches, I got to break 'em off
Got 'em breathin' heavy as Vader givin' a monologue
Mazel-tov, Wolf in the game and you just a common dog (arf)
I don't even care... my name be ringin' bells like
Hector Salamanca with dynamite in his wheelchair
So get right, C. Webby is dead nice
You don't know me, so trust me bitch just tread light

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me, then you better tread light
Oh you people got a lot to say, well okay step up to the mic
(Step, Step up, Step up)
But you ain't my homie, so i'm not gonna play nice
All I need is sixteen bars, swear to God I could end your life
(Take that motherfuckers)

[Verse 2: Apathy]
Shatter matter, at a rate the fake evaporate
Evacuate the wake, they lay the body I decapitate
I take the head and tape it to the hood of my whip
Foot on the metal wooden grip, floatin' like a wooden ship
Shouldn't shitty rappers ask us permission to rhyme?
Permission declined, the mics booby trapped with fishin' line
Finna shine since a fetus, I can see the finish line
Vicious mind, victims lyin' in blood while I split your spine
Now I'm spyin' on these bitches showin' titties on Vine
Lookin' pretty, hoes pose in front of Hollywood signs
If it comes to Me and You, you lose... every time
I been deadly with the rhymes since Nirvana, Nevermind
Never whine, never cryin', never dyin', I'm designed
Out of iron, I'm a lion, I'm defined as divine
I'm Allah, I'm Jehovah, Amen-rah, I'm a soldier
I'm a boulder-movin' mutant, super human, shit is over
Supernova, super soaker full of acid, I'm blastin'
I'm blackin' out, passin' out laughin' at the fact that you rappin'
I'm rapidly crackin' you crackers in the cabbage for braggin'
I'm body baggin' hoes, y'all shorter then Bilbo Baggins

[Hook: Chris Webby]
If you don't know me, then you better tread light
Oh you people got a lot to say, well okay step up to the mic
(Step, Step up, Step up)
But you ain't my homie, so i'm not gonna play nice
All I need is sixteen bars, swear to God I could end your life
(Take that motherfuckers)
