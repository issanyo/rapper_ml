[Intro]
Yeah, Webby, Freeway, yeah!
Block to the Burbs, man
If you nice, you nice, end of story

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I'm reppin' for the burbs, still I'm murderin' verses
With Connecticut inserted in ink on my epidermis
Written in my skin layer, with rhymin', I've been greater
Writin' lyrics on a piece of paper since a sixth grader
With my CD disc player, playin' loud up in the Sony phones
With a style of the flowin' that I call my own
CT's what I call my home and I'm never leavin' you
Put us on the map is what I need to do
And even through the hate and the criticism I take it and listen
But all you fakers are breakin' the way I rape 'em with lyricism
I stay with the clearest rhythm, regardless of burb spot
Burbs to the blocks if you spittin' a verse hot
And that's all that matters, you either got it or not
Regardless of where you grew up at with your mom and your pops
See, I'm in it to the finish, never plottin' to stop
Rhymin' heat, pilot seat, kamikaze the spot
Think you dope? Well you're probably not
I could body the block with nothin' but a sixteen on the top
I'm like Tony Soprano when I rip it I bust flow in a suburban commando
And I'm bigger than Hulk Hogan
Check it I'm wreckin' every consecutive second
In from Philly back to the 2-03 that's what we representin'
I've been destined to make it, and I won't stop 'til I get it
And now it's Freezer and Webby, two different worlds are connected

[Hook: Chris Webby & (Freeway)]
Ride to the 'burbs, take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(Man, they hatin' when we visit, come around they girls)
(Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world)
From the burbs to the block take a trip with me
We gon' cruise all around the world
(When we visit try to keep us from around your girls)
(Visit burbs, visit ghettos all around the world)

[Verse 2: Freeway]
911 it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From the hood to the burbs, every one of you people heard of Free-
Way, and for y'all that ain't heard of me
House old one in '06, no burglary
Survived the Roc split, continued to drop hits
These rappers continue to bite my shit, commit perjury
Outer space bars, Freezer still spit mercury
Flow is from outta this planet, women from Venus
Men are from whatever planet, they think with they penis
E.T. bars, spacemen look for me when they land it
Never panic, hit up Webby tell him, "Ready to canvas"
Globetrotter, I'm in Africa, be back by the evenin'
Don't sweat it, I will be there on behalf of the Beamer
Plus the Delta Sky team while I insist that I'm reppin'
When I fly that's who I fly with, I'm a diamond member
Any weather, ? I can get up on a jet and jet it?
Back home they call me Chester, cause I get the cheddar
Yeah I get to the green, I got my shit together
It's a national hustler, I still ? rocks in the united states
Still bobblin' mecca, from the burbs to the ghetto
Word to the wise, never lie in your rap songs, learn from Geppetto
Pinnocchio, tell lies and your nose grow
Me and Webby ride, get cheddy 'til we old folks

[Hook]

[Outro]
From the Burbs to the Block
Burbs to the ghetto
