[Intro: Chris Webby]
Chase the high until it fades
Better pace myself
Push my limits everyday
Till I break myself
My time is on the way, ay, ay, ay
Better brace myself
'Cause if I didn't give this shit my all I swear to god I couldn't face myself

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I been telling these stories about my life (my life, my life)
Out around a campfire all night (out around a campfire all night)
Just trying to find my through the moonlight (I'm just trying to find a way)
I'm just tryin' to hide my pain as I hydroplane
Till my tires strain in the left lane, with a depressed brain
Callin' my doctor up, hoping my med's came
Another panic attack feeling my chest tight
Can't even see the road, losing my head lights
I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without it I think I would lose it
So gather round
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what's you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out, campfires out
Telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Put my soul up on a page as I judge myself
Cigarettes and cocaine, I don't trust myself
Drinking whiskey for the pain (ane, ane, ane) and blunt might help
Lacking self-respect with all the love I get why can't I find a way to love myself
I've been telling my stories to anyone listening (better listen, listen, listen)
I've done so much but still I feel so insignificant (insignificant, yeah, yeah)
Been battling all these demons ever since my christenin' (go to war with all these demons)
But still I'm hearin' breathin', tryna find a reason, why I'm breakin' even
I should have more by now from all these tours and crowds
But it's just me and this bottle, so I'm about to pour it down
Fire gonna scorch the ground while I be telling my tales
Follow a treacherous trail but in the end I prevail
I know

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without it I think I would lose it
So gather round
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt, fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out campfires out telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I deal with afflictions by willingly filing prescriptions
I live with conditions that really don't fit the descriptions
My grit and conviction's the reason I'm still in existence
My will and ambition's the reason I'm still in the business
Still I just wish I could turn off the shit in my brain
The positive and all negative, livin' the yin and the yang
I'm still insecure even when they be telling me, "Webby, you killing the game"
But feel like I'm still in the rain, I wait for these feelings to change
A fifth of the Jameson, I'll sip it away
Just give me whatever, I don't want to deal with this pain
Simple and plain, I don't want to bitch and complain
My life really isn't so bad, I'm making a living, it's strange
That I'm even feeling this way, I gotta be tough for the fans
I gotta be tough for my team, I gotta be tough for my fam'
People are counting on me and I cannot fuck up the plan
Just give me a bottle, I'm fine, I'll bottle it up in advanced
Don't stop and check in on myself, I just keep on moving ahead
My wounds never heal completely, no time for the bruises to mend
I push it all down like society says I should do as a man
Don't know how to talk about it but when written in music, I can
This is the way I get through with this music is all that I got
On top of that, I run a business, I need to be callin' the shots
With all the pressure of that mixed with the pressure of life
Got all this pressure that's pressing me, feel like my heads in a vice
I tell myself every night

[Chorus: Chris Webby & Jitta On The Track]
I gotta keep on pushing through it
And my therapy is making music
Without I think I would lose it
So gather round'
Gather round, listen up
'Cause what you know is, is not enough
Grab a blunt, fill your cup
Let me tell you some'
Till the campfires out, campfires out
Telling stories til' the campfire's out
Light the match into the kerosene
Show what life is like behind the scene
