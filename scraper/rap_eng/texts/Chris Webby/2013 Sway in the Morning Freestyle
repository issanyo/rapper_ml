[Intro]
Oo yeah, this some super villain shit
I like it
Yo, it's C Webby

[Verse]
These people rate my music triple X
With all the X I rap about, and add the fact I'm getting all your bitches wet
You wanna come at the best, then bring a bigger bed
Cause I'm a rottweiler dawg, you a Giga Pet
I bag O's like General Mills
Now I'm on a paper chase for those federal bills
But you know it's Chris Webby, you could listen what I'm speaking
I got paper in my pocket, the shit to roll my weed in
You know I get it popping, I'm dropping, I stay nice
When I'm rocking on the mic, and yeah fuck it, I am white
But I got a lot of weed and we 'bout to give it a light, mon
Chilling here with mics on, blowing up like pipe bombs
That's just how I'm going, i'm coming for the throne
So fuck it I'm home, rapping with Muggsy Malone
We back in the booth, and yo they can't see me
It's CT, and on the mic i'm a Web MD
I'm like a surgeon, I'm that dude on Google that you be searching
And no one ever messing, cause you know that I be hurting
Any motherfucker stepping it, you'll be resting bitch
In peace that is, yeah I'm coming out Connecticut
You know I'm coming through, you fuck with me you getting slaughtered
I'm a genius, why the fuck you think I'm drinking Smart Water?
I be going in and rapping the shit
No one could say that I'm not off of the top when I come through chilling with Sway
I be going, and they think it's again like Doomsday
Cause I go in off the top and like hey
You know I'm coming through and doing that shit when I be dropping nice
Eyes bugging out of they head like Rocko's Modern Life, I go in
And add some Nickelodeon, I'm flowing and nobody controlling him
You know I got the sodium, a lot of salt up on my french fries
Don't test guys, I'll knock you down as easy as I swat flies
I'm coming in, I got the six piece up there at Popeye's
And swap spit with your fucking bitch on my dick when I be coming ridiculous
No one be coming and I'm wrapping shit up just like a Christmas gift
It just be coming, you know I'm coming through
And no one ever fucking with me, it's Chris W
I'm from the burbs, they like "Yo, he ain't from the hood so he ain't spitting shit"
Well if that's your fucking theory that's ridiculous
Because I'm nice, and you know that I be rhyming cool
And yes I did go to motherfucking private school
I know a lot, yeah I had a fucking scholarship
And yeah I had your mother too, and she hollered quick
And then I made her spit, but she swallowed it
No one ever stopping, beating me is just preposterous, dawg
I'm coming new, you know that I'm writing
Coming with lightning like this is fucking Clash of the Titans
I'm fucking ill, when I be flowing no one ever be holding me
You know nobody dope as me, repping 2-0-3
That's just where I'm coming from, and I'm stunting son
Hands around your bitch like a cummerbund
You know I'm going in, that's just how I'm rapping
Beating me don't happen, I'm the next Eric Clapton
With the shit I spit with passion, ripping them apart
Like Apocalypto I'll be standing at the top of your heart, bitch
