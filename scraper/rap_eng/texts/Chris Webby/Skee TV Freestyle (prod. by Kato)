Yeah, Webby, Kato on the beat
We walking around handing out free cd's to tearing it down on Skee TV
You see whenever Webby's bringing a track, it's been cooked up by the best
Shit i'm the fucking Jesse Pinkman of rap
I get these verses written quickly as your fingers will snap and stay faded
Slurrin' words, spillin' drink's on my lap
I keep my weed in glass jars, spittin' mad bars
High on trees like the lemurs down in madagascar
I'm a fucking rap star so don't try to act hard
You'll get murdered on the mic and buried in my backyard
So chi-chi get the yayo im trying to throw a party
Cuz i seen these bitches walking around Cali lookin' like barbies
I'm trying to fuck em' all so sorry i'm not sorry
I'm on board, you watching the ride you damn carnies
You know sick as folk every single fucking word is dope
Steppin out my chevy surrounded by all this purple smoke
Banging older women, got these cougars gettin' down b
For real how the fuck you think your mother heard about me

Yo this shit is what the fuck I do, you can run and tell DJ Skee
While he's tearing shit down on the 1's and 2's
Bring the fire everywhere we be
Cuz i'm a god damn monster and they know my name from L.A all the way back east
So get used to my face cuz i know one thing, your all about to see a lot of me

Yeah, mother fucker i've been doin this shit man y'all just catching up
Shout to Skee TV, Hip-Hop Nation
Wud up
