Read Chris Webby's Explanation "On My Way"

[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Verse 1]
Why am I like this? Always on the grind like this, ever since '09 like this
Tryna find my niche..
And I got a taste of fame, played the game, and now I'm convinced
That the money isn't worth earning
If you don't take from the lessons you're learning
As you embark on your personal journey
Navigate life while that fire is burning
Deep in your soul, before you get old
And live with regret for not reachin' your goals
(No, no, no)
Just keep up that fight when your back's on the ropes
Because the people you think are the closest
Will turn into strangers before you could notice
Been stabbed in the back but I never lost focus
Got my eye on the prize till I hold it

[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Verse 2]
I'm still reachin' for the skyline, got my hand raised, tell me teacher when will I shine?
Cause I've been sittin' in the bleachers on the side lines
Spent a whole life time, followin' the guide lines
Now I will strike while the iron is hot, aim right for the top
They will not deny me a spot
So fuck if they like it or not, cause my grind didn't stop
And I'm still in my prime sit and watch
As I do what I'm designed to do
And if my fans still ride then I'm ridin' too
If the numbers don't lie then I'm climbin' through
Supplyin' you, with music to find you through
Any time when the skies seem grey and rainy
And your dreams seem too far away
And life in itself's bout to make you crazy
Just put your headphones on and say

[Hook]
Let me hear ya say, ay
I been on this road too long on my, way
With my top down livin' carefree let me hear you say, ay
To infinity and the beyond I'm on my, way
Said I'm on my way (let me hear you say)

[Outro]
Don't see no rain clouds
Above my play ground, no no
Till the wheels fall off and we break down
I will not lay down, no no
.. Let me hear ya say
