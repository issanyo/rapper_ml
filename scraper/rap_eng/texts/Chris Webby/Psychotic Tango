Damn
I can barely even stand
Sippin cough syrup while I'm rolling up a gram
And this a prescription addiction
Grab a Percocet, crush it up and start sniffin
Liftin
Up to another mental zone
Pills 600 mills and we just pop them to the dome
Hydrocodone..any sedative will do it
Then whip out the uppers when you be ready to do shit
Crushin up the Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall
Take a couple Focalins and you be bouncin off the walls
And then just snort some coke and yeah you'll ready for a brawl
Feelin invincible like you were 10 feet tall
Been around seen it all
There ain't nothing to show me
Movin super slowly when I be touchin the OCs
You know me
So don't start with me
Desk drawer lookin' like a fuckin pharmacy
There's no harmin me
I got some Vicodin
I'm feelin numb
Walk into any fight and win
Taking sleeping pills and staying up panicking
Bugged out can't even stand on the Ambien
Lunesta you betcha
That shit will getcha
Gotcha doin stupid shit you won't even remember
A new mental state is entered
That ain't a lie
Cause you know we staying gettin' high off the doctor prescribed
I lost my motherfuckin brain yo
Dancing the psychotic tango
God dang bro
Higher than mars
Shit im seein stars
Got some Xanys and you know we just down them like candy bars
R to the X from the doctors desk
Perception is altered so watch your step
I'm next, mind fucked up
Life is beautiful
Fucking with street drugs and these pharmaceuticals
Without a care in the world for shit thats around me
Got pills that could make an elephant feel drowsy
You know how we
Get down
Whats up
Poppin orange bottles
Get them pills rounded up
Hot comes back, bouncin up
And on top of that I got a whole ounce so fuck
Imma stay under the influence, rhyming truth
Now I know why all these bottles made child proof
My minds on the loose
Took enough to kill
But still
I think its time to pop another pill
So I guess I will
