[Intro]
I got the game on lockdown, ridin' with the top down, and I'm feeling so good
Baby we'll be headed to the top now cause it's the only way to go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm on a roll now, traveling all around the globe
Only my booking agent know where I'm about to go
With a pretty young thing and an ounce to roll
Live that rockstar life call me Aldous Snow, uh
Feeling great, filet mignon on my plate
But I'm always staying hungry, you can see it on my face
You can see it in my eyes, I'mma win this race
Pulling through the finish line, like Brink on skates
And I'm feeling spectacular, still an eligible bachelor
It's so lovely, french kissing models with some molly on my tongue
In a different city every night like I was on the run
We gone, we gone, shout to everyone who supports me
Legal troubles over with, no more going to court, B
Now I'm chilling with a Vicky and a Courtney, top down, warp speed

[Hook]
I always told them "I will never stop" now, look at what I got now
Always knew that I would, baby, and we headed to the top now
Cause it-it's the only way to go
Now I got the game on lock-down, riding with the top down
And I'm feeling so good, baby, and we headed to the top now
Cause it-it's the only way to go

[Verse 2]
I been out to sea, had to send an SOS
But I made it back to shore and I'm next on deck
Always got a little sexy brunette on text
Saying "I'll see you when you back in town xox"
I've been slept on like futons, looked over like typos
Now you see my fucking name up in the lights, yo
Always been the under dog call me Fido
But I know, and always knew that I would win the fight bro
Either that or I'm going to go down swinging
Never back down if we gotta throw down, bring it
But still we having fun, strip club, pile of ones
And act a jackass, R.I.P Ryan Dunn
Shout to Sap always killing a track
We just some kids making money, what's the matter with that
And until I get a Grammy I'll be doing just dandy
The black sheep's now the bread winner of the family

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go
Way to go, way to go, it's the only way to go

[Verse 3]
I only think about it when I'm looking back
To the kid I used to be writing lyrics during class
Back when I had nothing but ambition and a dream
And a composition notebook full of rhyme schemes
I mean, I was a fuck up, but then I grew the fuck up
And gave it everything while I was working on my come up
And now I came up and baby I won't stop till I'm done
So now I'm yelling at the top of my lungs (Let's go!)

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm feeling good right now, man
All these years of hard work are finally paying off
There's really only one direction to go now
And that's up, so ya'll coming with me or what
