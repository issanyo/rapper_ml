[Intro:]
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon break you down, down, down, down, down
And when the walls come crashing down, down, down
I promise Babylon will fall down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I used to care what people say
Used to try to please everyone but myself but baby that ain't me today
I done changed my DNA, I done came from a dark street
Just shout to all the plants that's growin' through concrete
'Cause the system is designed to put all us in hard conditions
How can we survive in this world of lawyers and politicians?
When 90% of cases are plea deals, get rid of us in prision
'Cause I can't afford a trial to prove my innocence
But I know they try to bring me down 'cause they look up to me
I can let 'em get to me or not that's totally up to me
Negative people are so fast to bully but see that shit more dangerous than that Kardashian pussy
I'm playin' but I'm sayin' there's always light in the dark
That R dash Mean a fuckin' freedom fighter a heart
Just know United we strong, let's chant together as one
So now off the top of our lungs...

[Chorus]
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon break you down, down, down, down, down
And when the walls come crashing down, down, down
I promise Babylon will fall down

(Chris Webby)
Yeah
It's a pretty messed up world we live in man
Don't let it get to you
One step at a time, Webby

I promise I ain't ever going down quietly
Flex my wrist and break the shackles of society
They tried to influence the image of what I should try to be
Selling the American dream, all the irony
These corporate slogans chosen and rebranded as wisdom
Take out our third eye and keep the masses in submission
While private prisons are makin' private deals
While politicians in the Media pushin' racial tensions to make us different
When really we all the same and we in this shit together
It's the ones in charge that hold the puppet strings we 'bout to sever
Ain't takin' no half mentions on my road to reach the treasure
Through the darkest nights I see infared 'til it's gettin' better
'Cause the game is rigged against us so we gotta step up
And tear this Idiocracy down, fuck if they let us
These letters the prophet speak will inspire a revolution
Come scribble down lyrics to a movement
Yeah

[Chorus]
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon bring you down, yeah, yeah
Don't let the Babylon break you down, down, down, down, down
And when the walls come crashing down, down, down
I promise Babylon will fall down
