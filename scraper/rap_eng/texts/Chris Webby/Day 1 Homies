[Hook: Irv Da Phenom]
I don't know what you heard
Don't know what they told ya
Please make no mistakes you dealin' with the real
Been down since day 1
Be here when when it's over
I can't fuck with you if you don't keep it real
I'm only rocking with my day 1, my day 1 homies
Yeah I'm still rocking with my day 1, my day 1 homies

[Verse 1: Irv Da Phenom]
Now we go way back like Cadillacs
Stay down like four flats
You got mine I got your back
Been down to ride and you know that
We solid, yeah rocking with you cause you solid
Now I got my right hand, my partners
So glad that I gotcha
Been down since the ramen
Now it's steak and lobster
Been grinding, yeah, so if I got it then you got it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
I'm with my day 1 homies, y'all niggas all phony
If my grandma was here she's say that y'all full of bologna
Acting like you know me, little brodee be real
We ain't hooped, we ain't fucked hoes we ain't even chill
I'm with my niggas from the day, probably hit the J
Playing 2K sipping Bombay
Bout to hit the club and flex on a couple scrubs
Hit the bottle, pull a model with a pretty ass face
And we say No new friends, no new friends
No new friends no no new
Unless it's you with them high heeled shoes
Say you already know I say what you tryna to do
And now she's loving the crew
These little niggas all got something to prove
And if a dude acting weird in my face, in my space
I'mma treat him like a fat bitch I ain't fucking with you
Lil Nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I got love for my day 1 homies
Only people that really do know me
I'm an only child
But with friends like these fools I will never feel lonely
See my real peoples remember me
When I was just that kid who rapped
And sold eighth and quarter sacs
Right off of my fucking cul-de-sac
Now I'm a big deal
But around my homies man I'm still just Christian
No yes men in my team, if I fuck up they gonna tell me I'm slippin'
When my head get a little to big, they the first ones sayin' I'm trippin'
But we keep it home grown since day 1 they seen the vision

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
We've been homies since the jump
So I'll always keep them with me
And the one we lost is tatted on me
Rest in peace Nicky
We been rockin' way before all these other people knew me
And now I'm up on the stage and they're in the back fuckin' my groupies

[Outro: Irv Da Phenom]
My day 1, my day 1 homies
Yeah I'm still rocking with my day 1, my day 1 homies
