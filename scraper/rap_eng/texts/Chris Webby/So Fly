[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
So fly, so fly, so fly, yeah
I'm so fly that it's dangerous
Rocking the ear flaps with a handkerchief
Always stay around trees like I'm Ranger Rick
Load up the cloud pen and then I take a rip
Ya girl's favorite like Yankovic, I'm weird as well
Your opinion doesn't affect me you could clearly tell
Living life to the fullest while I'm here
And when the end's near, I just hope they serve beer in Hell
But uh, I ain't worried 'bout the fire and brimstone
â€˜Cause that's a fair trade for the life that I live, Holmes
Feet up on the street, it's like I'm riding with Flintstones
Gotta stay grounded when you fly as I've been, yo
So much drink I need a extra thermos
So cold I better get a furnace, yeah
Tattoos cover up my epidermis
On my grind until I get it perfect, bitch

[Hook: Alandon]
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Webby's back just like a spinal cord
More wacks than a vinyl store
See I keep a good vibe until it's time for war
And when it is, kid, you better find a sword
A samurai at core, my Camaro like the Trojan horse
You gon' see an army role out when we open doors
Like I walked the fucking plank, I'm going overboard
Holy Lord, crazy's what they know me for
I'm a, fresh dude in a pair of Reeboks
So fly that when I look down, I stare at treetops
I'm uh, high as knee socks, started with a beatbox
Now I'm on these stages, show the whole world how we rock
Baby call me Fiat, I'm speeding through the left lane
Alien mindset, the brain up in my head is Krang
Let it rain, let it pour, verbally I steady aim
Mic in hand, I'm accurate as Jesse James, bang

[Hook: Alandon]
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I
I'm so high, you could think I'm upside down
I'm so alive, could feel my heart pump right now
I'm so fly, I could never touch back down
I'm so fly, I
