[Verse 1] Demrick
Dj Hoppa, Demrick!
I got that champagne overload, marijuana overdose, money over hoes, so my casket get closed, that's for sure
Pass it back and forth, we get high, we get high, moving weight up on the block on California time
Borderline out mind my I done lost it I'm exhausted for you try to double crosses count you're blessing and you're loses mothers fathers sons and daughters pay attention pay attention keep my name out you're mention you don't wanna go against us I got Gucci on the lenses, cruising in the benz's I do this shit relentless from the beginning to the ending
Never slow time blow up get my door up and I'm chilling till then fuck you, get used to that feeling its like I gotta re introduce the feeling, the new villain that starts where [?] pop a Xanax don't panic get your weight up my heart is Darth Vader but my mind is on the paper

[Hook]
Never slow time go up, [?] keep on rolled, we gone blow up
Never slow time go up, niggas want then of course we gone load up
(the higher i get) (you know what it is!) [2x]

[Verse 2] Chris Webby
Trying to take over the world like those couple of labs rats, double my cash stack, who fucking with that math
If any of my feathers get ruffled, I snap fast, kill the Aflac duck now hes stuffed in my back pack
Que the laugh track if they stepping to C-Web Ill smack a meat head right out of his v-neck, mix of a honey badger and a lyrical weed head, caning it for rehab but I don't wanna leave yet
I'm a sick fuck, bitch what, I ain't ever backing down, I got balls, yeah I'm repping out of Pallet Town
Roll a doobie, light it, then I'll let it pass around so if you would like go a head and grab it now
Me and Demrick simply nothing but effortless, I'm the game genie, I come with a Sega Genesis
Want to watch me work just point me to where a pencil is
See them hills over there? you should probably head for it, it's Webby bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3] Demrick
I'm always ready never slippin' tunnel vision, I keep L.A. on my fitted, there's a difference when you lit us, [?] some murder in my sense, kill the game, kill the game, all these fuck boys and lames, I just don't entertain. do my thing then I [?] roll some jet, I get lit, when you go against who you get that is not a threat, and I'm fucking with these [?] that's why i gotta be select
We on a higher level consciousness just take another hit. this that fast lane lifestyle, pockets full of lifestyle, taking my right now, never putting this pipe down, so pass the [?] with it, blast on sight, niggas flash, but some don't make it past the night, its too easy like I did this shit in the past life, let me [?] like the front of a flash light, fit the henney i drink [?] don't act like you're flow is fucking [?] that tight

[Hook]
