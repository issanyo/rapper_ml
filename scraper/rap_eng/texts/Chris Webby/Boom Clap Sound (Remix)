[Intro]
When it feels like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

[Verse 1: D-Loc]
Zippity zippity bappity bap
Zip zip zoom, bap bap boom
Rippity rack, clickity clack
Put one in the hole I'm ready to rap
This how we do when the Kings in the building
That's how we do when the caps start peeling
That's how we do when the barrel goes bam
That's how we do when I'm smoking on my gram yeah
Tell me what you motherfuckers really wanna do
Wanna run around the track while I run around it too
Wanna run run, get that, split that
Run run run let me hit that, rip that
Hit that, rip that, get that, go
Let me put it in the pipe, let me back it in the bowl
Let me run run run run run run
Like motorbike racer running this show

[Verse 2: Johnny Richter]
I never really get upset all the way to the point
Where I feel like there's no holding back now
Try to get a good outlet, try to reroute
All the things that are weighing me down now
All it seems I need is a big bag of weed
And a couple shots of lets say Crown
A few dope beats and I’m taking a Jeep
To a mountain top out of town
That's where I go when I gotta get out so
I don’t blow my top off and explode
Cause when I lose control there's not enough time
For me to come back one piece, body whole
I know you know or at least I know you relate
Cause I've heard so many stories told
Gotta take a leap of faith
Put your song on your headphones
And know that your not alone

[Hook]
When it feels like the sky is falling
And the world is crumbling down, woah!
Listen deep inside your body
For that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound
When the people with the hands and feet dance
Start spinning around (zoom zoom zoom)
Everybody it's time to party
With that boom clap clap, boom clap clap
Boom clap clap sound

[Bridge]
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom all day
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom away
Listen to the sounds of the KMK

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Web hit em with that boom clap sound
Weed in the bubbler, turn back round
Higher than the Martians when I'm sparkin'
With a needle I'm Shontelle, just touched down now
Every dude stay rocking out
All the potheads from the college dropping out
Stay rapping truth, need apple juice
Cause everybody on the track got Kottonmouth
We rock those speakers, drop that ether
Boom clap hit em with that onomatopoeia
Breaking the chronic like the continents that made up Pangaea
A son of anarchy, constantly copping cannabis
A medical grade from a dispensary in Los Angeles
Can't handle this, amateurs get devoured in my sandwiches
I eat MCs for breakfast lunch and dinner, got no manners kid
Wayne and Garth in the building
I'm here to get my party on, and get my Marley on
Cause we burning like Rastafarians
Everyday is Mardi Gras, so bitch show me your titties now
Pass the piff around till we finish the whole fricken pound
Kottonmouth and Webster dropping it professional
So lifted off the ground that they think we're extraterrestrials

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I don’t know 'bout to lose control
Here they go, whoop whoop
Boom clap, boom clap, sound of the Po
Sound of the Po, sound of the Po
I don’t know 'bout to lose control
Here they go, weoh weoh

[Verse 4: The Dirtball]
Hear that, that be the sound of the police, on their way
To ruin your time woah! Everybody in the area
Spark it up so they lose their mind
Boom clap fo shizzy, I’m gonna keep these raps busy
I’m gonna keep my brain all dizzy
Better get a map when you get a boom clizzy
Clap clap when you hear my gun go BLAP BLAP
That be the level of the party
And bring it so give me the bubble, and snap snap yeah
Now let it all go, we'll move to the beat
Keep giving me the bass, an feeling the street
In front of the crowd, an boiling in the heat
And never stop, and never decease, I’m off the leash
So give me the keys, you've got to believe me
Open your eyes so now you can see me
Over the lies, I’m over the dreamy
Keep looking around, I’m banging the ground
Forever I’m peeling, just give me the track
I’m eating your guts and stealing
Similar times resemble the grizzly feeding
Resembling what I’m achieving
Related to rap, and call me a heeven
Fuck everybody, I’m ending up leaving
The party is over, disgust it ain't stopping
Reserve it for good but now it ain't popping
An now that I see your true colors I think I'll be dropping
Outta the race to keep it from floppin'
Keepin' the party alive, the only one option
The only one option is what

[Hook]
