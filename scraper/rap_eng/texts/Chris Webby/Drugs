[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeahh, ha
Y'all gonna think I'm crazy for this one. But...
...I am, Haha, so its all good
Check

[Verse 1]
I'm a drug abuser
Smoking crack out of a hookah
Feeling like my brain just got blasted with a bazooka
Smoking shit greener than King Koopa
Smoked into a stupor
So high that I had to learn air plane maneuvers
Im used to putting in work
Popping so many perks, getting shot wouldn't even hurt
I just can't feel my face
Lost my sense of smell and taste
But shit, I feel great!
Wait, you can try to send me away
They won't let me in
I'll be in rehab, OD-ing on cough medicine
Chugging robitussin till my thoughts amount to nothing
One pill short of a junkie
But fuck it, end of discussion

[Hook: Chris Webby]
I'll try to stop, but they keep me moving
So I guess I'll probably just keep on doing
These fucking drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs. [Hahaha]
My brains not far from ruined
But I just pop a zanny bar and keep on doing
These fucking drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs

[Ha, yeah]

[Verse 2]
I've been burning since prepubescence
So I gotta know the drill
Snorting advil through a 20 dollar bill
Outta my mind, thats just straight to the point
Skipped 5th grade D.A.R.E. class to blaze up a joint
Poppin', rollin', and blowin', Shit, till I'm quite buzzed
Lightyear, right here, even fresher than I was
Damn it, I like drugs
I'll be popping G ladies until I'm at least eighty
And still can't see straightly
I stay fucked up, I can't deny it
Drinking like a Pirate, getting higher than a pilot
Bagging up dubs, making middler schoolers buy it
"Its the cool thing to do, Trust me man you gotta try it!"

[Hook]

[I've lost my mind]

[Verse 3]
I'll roll a dime, I'll blow a line, popping X till the fluid in my spines missing
More official than most pretenders
Known to light up at night like motion sensors
Acid tabs on my tongue, till I stare at the sun
And see more than one, at that point, I'm done
My minds on the run, but I'm rapping hot
Blasting off like an astronaut
Watch
My brains fucking corroded from blowing loads of the coca
And rolling up so much E that my pupils almost exploded
I know that when its over, and I get a little older
I'll still be a fucking stoner
Forgetting how to be sober

[Hook]
