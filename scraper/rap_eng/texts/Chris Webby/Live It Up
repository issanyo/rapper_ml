[Intro]
Yeah, we here now man
Only way to go is up, ha

[Hook]
Yeah, Travel 'round the world, world
Rollin with my windows up
Makin out with wit
Brim low, we don't give a fuck
Till I, till I die you know I'll have my middle fingers up
So I'mma live it up, I'mma I'mma live it up    [X2]

[Verse 1 Webby]
And I'm feeling like I'm so damn high I'll never hit the ground
I used to dream about exactly what the fuck I'm livin now
So, Uh, just let me have my moment, soak it in
Been through ups and downs, but shit I'm never goin broke again

This is all that I know, since I was a little kid
Makin water bottle bongs, smokin Arizona mids
Watching MTV sayin that's how I wanna live
Now a decade later and that shit's exactly what I did

From the cyphers back in middle school, every day at lunch
Burnin mixtapes on my laptop and sellin em out my trunk
Who'd of thunk that that little punk way back in the day
Would turn around and be a superstar selling out these stages

It's amazing how I'm feelin cuz I know that I'm about to be
Laughin from the top at every naysayer who doubted me
Chillin, breakin break with all my homies who been down with me
Mom and dad now y'all got a reason to be proud of me

[Hook]
Travel 'round the world, world
Rollin with my windows up
Makin out with wit
Brim low, we don't give a fuck
Till I, till I die you know I'll have my middle fingers up
So I'mma live it up, I'mma I'mma live it up    [X2]

[Verse 2]
Been on the brink of superstardom for a minute now
Had to get my business right, now we got it figured out
Had to pay a lot of dues, but that's what this shit's about
Watch my competition sellin out, but I took a different route

They wonder why it took so long to see the kid shine
Shit, if I was in it for the money I'd have been signed
Stayin true to me, now I'm on some other shit
The journey was tumultuous, but now we mother fuckin rich

And shit I'll take it man, cuz it's on my own terms
I never sold my soul, I just waited my own turn
And now I've got it, so I'm bout to auto rock it
With some pot up in my paper and some profit in my pocket

Started out playin graduations and sweet sixteens
Now I got the masses listenin to each sixteen
Fuck a slice, I'mma lick the fuckin deep dish clean
Cuz in the end i'm just a kid who's tryna reach his dreams (I'm comin)

[Hook]
Travel 'round the world, world
Rollin with my windows up
Makin out with wit
Brim low, we don't give a fuck
Till I, till I die you know I'll have my middle fingers up
So I'mma live it up, I'mma I'mma live it up    [X2]
