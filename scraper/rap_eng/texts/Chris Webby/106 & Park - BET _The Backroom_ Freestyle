I'm never rated G, said every swear from A to Z
Since way before the show was first hosted by both AJ and Free
And at this point I think these rappers are afraid of me
Up in the cypher by myself like guys why won't you play with me?
But I dont stress it
Ima' spit and teach em' a lesson
And show them that Connecticut's here, there's no question
I kill the mic from the very moment I step in
About as often as future re-use and pitch correction
I am
A freak of nature
Write these words on a piece of paper
And when I drop it, it's guaranteed it'll leave a crater
A season change, flowing a hundred degrees or greater
So amped up I do stuff and can't remember the reason later
I rap for all kinds of people just check my client list
Rapping like I never left the 90's, on my grimey-ish
I had the RZA teach me how to throw the iron fist
Now your off your feet like a podiatrist required it
Huh
Beat you in your effin' skull with a giant stick
Like I'm Donatello so really I wouldn't try it trick
Show you what time it is
So let me in the cipher
And spit fire off the top like Nick Cage in Ghost Rider Kid
Rep the Suburbs
Everyday we ****
And drink alot of beer and party
Until we see the sun sir
Cable television said no cuss words
Still I am a monster
Keep hiding under your covers
