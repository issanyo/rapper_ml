[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Still I'm off the chain, Webby need a leash
I'm consistently givin' you shit that's clever and unique
If you don't think that I'm wreckin' every second that you sleep
You basically played yourself like Puff an get him to the Greek
Now when I be spittin' people actually listen
Because Webby be rippin' with grammatical precision
Adverbs and adjectives, kickin' all these damn vowels
Constanents till my enemy sweat, here's a hand towel
ShamWow salesman, beatin' up you bitches
Cookin' up a classic with this heat from out the kitchen
I'm originally genius, brain out of proportion
And got your girls legs spread wider than Air Jordan
I'm ballin', every single syllable I said is clear
Ridin' into Camelot to stick it into Guinevere
King Aurthur flow, on top like the Northern Hemisphere
Murderin' the verse, so I guess that I gotta end it here

[Hook]
Webby's on the flow, fitted hat low, they already know it's about to go down
Bout to go down, bout to go down, bout to go down, down, down, down
And when I get signed on that dotted line
They already know it's about to go down, they already know
They already know, they already know, they already know
They already know, it's about to go down

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Verse two, if your a mic, then I'mma murk you
Any problem I got I grin and bear it and work through
So stop sleepin', I'll give you a later curfew
Your not feelin' it? You must've took a perk dude
Cause I got everybody turnin' up they volume
Cause it's about to go down like a log flume
I live the life now, rappin' is my frickin' job
Roll with more bitches then racin' the Iditarod
Get it? cause girl dogs are called bitches
The Iditarod's a dog race, now keep up with it
If you can't follow my lyrics mothafucker just dance
Cause my lines above your head like a Red Woods branch
Rhymin' with the best, flyer then the rest
Steve Carell in Anchorman, I'll put a trident to your chest
I'm new school in the flesh
And they already know, they already know that Webby's up next

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm rollin' with an OZ, pockets always full of green
Logan with his dog tags on, I'm fuckin' Wolverine
Slicin' up my competition with the adamantium
Aimin' for a title that ain't ever had a champion
Stay poppin' Ambien to put me to sleep
Cause with all the Adderall shit, I'll be up for a week
Fuck it I'm done, the hottest dude under the sun
My Ninja's outnumber haters by a hundred to one
Shout to Mac Miller, MGK, Wax and Herbal T
Any white boy who can actually go hard's ok with me
I rep Connecticut exactly where I say I be
And I got Apathy's blessin', so I'mma stay ya see
Keep on hatin' me, you'll see the tables turn
Cause I'mma mothafuckin' animal in layman's terms
I'mma psychopathic off-spring of Satan's sperm
So walk in front of me an we'll see just the way you burn

[Hook]
