[Hook]
I'mma go ahead and do my thing
You just gotta let me off the chain
Yeah I'm off the chain, off the chain
You just got to go and let me off the chain
I'm off the chain

[Verse 1]
I'm like a rap star minus the money and the record deal
Bitch I'm whipping in a piece of crap car
But I don't give a fuck cause I spit it mad hard
You could inspect my lyrics never find a bad bar
I'm in my backyard rolling chronic, rap rollick
Artist like Jack Pollock, drop shit so sick I need an antibiotic
I'm an otter and I'll crack you like the shell of a mollusk
Oh my God, it's Webby With a machete
Ready to go after both Jason and Freddy
I am deadly like a black mamba, sipping Odwalla
Mixed with vodka running shit like the Godfather
So call me Corleone, I'm rolling with 40 homies
And you could hold the camera, come watch your shorty blow me
My first is in five minutes like off of the brains
So ask anybody bitch they'll say I'm off of the chain, ay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the next big thing in case you couldn't tell
Give me one mother fucker who'd say I wouldn't sell
I'm good and well here in the underground
Unsigned Hype dude, I don't fuck around
And see I'm buzzing now all over internets
Webby's on the web, you're behind if you haven't clicked it yet
I'm shooting free throws all you people miss the net
I'm off the chain bitch like an evicted pet
Get it? Cause if a pet got evicted
It, uh, wouldn't have a leash on... Man, shit, forget it
I'm twisted, roll it up, hit it
I'm so fucking dope They should put me on exhibit
Cause you know I rip it every day spitting more and more
Magic than any Slytherin or Gryffindor
Dumbledore's stepping in, feeling like the principle
Don't need a body guard, Webby's invincible
My life is inimitable, but I'mma push 'em to the back
Like I hired 'em as actors, I'll put 'em in a cast
With the punches that be flying at speeds above fast
So retrace your foot prints, bitch step back
What?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I walk in they call me the kid like Billy
Crushing Keystones all night get silly
Let's throw down at beer pong cause bitch I'm illy
Hit six cups, then I re-rack 'em like Willy
I am a Gremlin and I rhyme never ending
Stay getting high got no time for descending
People give me praises any time I get mentioned
Even though my skin's whiter than the belly of a penguin
I need an intervention before I go brain dead
With a pencil is the only time I aim lead
But me and your girl gon' wake up in the same bed
Wiping her mouth claiming she never even gave head
I'll murder K-Fed and hit Britney up
Oh, you got two kids? I don't give a fuck
She said hit me one more time so I hit it up
Lohan, I got a Trojan come here you little slut
So messed up looking for a pair of Double D's, please
Step to me, I fucking dare ya
Oh God, I'm seeing double no Tia and Tamera
Cause I hit 'em like Bam I don't need a Margera
