[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
We'd prolly never be an E-Harmony match
But ain't it funny how the opposites attract?
And listen baby
I ain't worried about your past cus you past that
I've got so many flaws myself I think I lost track
But you accept me for the dude I am
Not my persona
You fuck with who I truly am
But now I'm headed out on tour then I'm moving and
It's a shame that we couldn't get to follow cupids plan
But uhh
It ain't always simple like that
I'll be on the road, I don't want you livin' like that, nah
Maybe I'm not used to feelin' like that
But you different like that, and shit I like that
But I got a leash, I'll make my livin' like that
But just call me anytime, you know I'll hit you right back, you know?
I'll always have your back girl
This ain't goodbye forever, I could promise you that girl

[Hook: Jitta On The Track]
I've got your back
It will always be like that
I tell you that I'll be right back but...
Its not gonna be like that, if it don't seem like that
I've got your back
