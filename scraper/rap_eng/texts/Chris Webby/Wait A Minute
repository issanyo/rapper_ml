[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah !
See, listen up girl
You look good and all but
I gotta make my money
Gotta have priorities you know

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do?

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
There’s a woman that I love and she gave birth to me in 88
Aside from all these bitches all come second to the paper chase
Not to sound conceited but I work my fucking ass off
I'll be a dumb motherfucker if I let the women take away from me stacking all of my cash dawg
That’s all, end of story
You're good in bed and all but making money's mandatory
So salute the captain when I come through when I rip the rappin'
Got money on my mind it’s time to make it happen
Aside from the attraction you ain’t shit but a distraction
So just sit there and relax while I work on bringin' this cash in
Now that I got a taste of it, I just can’t stay away from it
This ain't me selling out, this is me on my makin' paper shit

[Bridge]
It's a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do ?

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
I need a second, we could work it out
Wait a minute, get it girl give me some time
I’m bout my money, on the grind 25 A spring
Summer winters snow nice sunny on
I just need you to be my ride or die
You know where I’m going, getting money is the alibi
Maybe when I hit a hundred mili I’ll be satisfied
Till then, gotta keep it rolling get your camera time
All that gotta hit the road jack
Why you’re acting crazy ? Think you need some Prozac
I know how them hoes act, and I leave em' alone so
You should know, who the star ? Girl it’s your show

[Bridge]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby, what I need you to do ?

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Now as the world keeps revolvin' and the planet keeps rotatin'
Got my eyes on the prize and only sucka niggas hatin'
I’m posted in the Lamb, man I’m putting in the time
If I’m tryin get the tickets so our stack is there to shine
It’s people on the sidelines, waiting for a chance
To be here in the starting lineup with the rock up in their hands
All I needed was a shot, but nobody ever gave me one
So I got tired of waitin' on it and went and made me one
Now I’m in the game, fuck the fortune and the pain
Don’t get caught up in the pleasant lights and banners with your name
It’s all here today then it’s all gone tomorrow
In the clubs you made it rain, they won't let you come back and borrow

[Bridge]
It’s a very big world with a lot of bad bitches
But I ain’t never met one like you, like you
But there's money to be made and I’m really tryin' to get it
So baby what I need you to do

[Hook]
Bitch you gotta, wait a minute, wait a minute
I got no fucking time you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You see I’m out here on the grind you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Yeah bitch I know you fine but you gotta
Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah
