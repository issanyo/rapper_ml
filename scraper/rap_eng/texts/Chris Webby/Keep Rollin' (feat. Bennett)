[Intro: Chris Webby]
Yeah...
I’ve noticed a lot about myself, the world, that I wish I could change in life
Fuck it
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
My name is Christian Webster, and I’m a troubled person
I take my medication but these pills ain’t fuckin’ working
I’m over 30 now, but there’s still so much I’m learning
The only thing I know for sure is there ain’t nothing certain
I got some trust problems, I got some love problems
You think I love problems 'cause I got so many of ‘em
I got some drug addictions, labeled as drug prescriptions
Thought I was done, I kicked ‘em
But the feel I’m getting from ‘em got me runnin back
No matter how many moments I hit that bottom and promise myself I’m done with that
My only skill is bustin’ raps, shit I fucking suck at math
And couldn’t even change my own tire if it was fucking flat
I’m insecure and imperfect and second-guess myself
And every day this pressure’s felt
Because the industry I’m in does a number on someone’s mental health
Maybe I should get some help
But

[Chorus: Bennett, Chris Webby]
I'ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
I'ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
I'ma keep on livin’ this way
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma keep on livin’ this way
(So I gotta keep rollin’)

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Some say I’m pessimistic
I say I’m well-informed
And terrified of what humanity is headed for
We’re destroying the planet, every day we wreck it more
Mother nature’s had it with us, now she’s trying to settle scores
There still be hella wars
And scummy politicians who will fuck the people over as long as their pockets thicken
Public servants? (huh) What a fucking contradiction
Red and blue alike should all be fuckin’ locked in prison
Every time I read the news it makes me mad as fuck
The shitty things that are happening keep on adding up
And now we’re way to lazy and fat and dumb as a population
To change anything - so really I should stop complaining
The world is ending anyways so at the end of days
I’ma light up 7 Js and leave this bitch hella blazed
‘Cause we off dancing to the fiddle that the devil plays
And it’s hellish ways out on centre stage
But really
I’m just tryna leave a positive mark
As the planet and society are fallin’ apart
I feel like we lost in the dark, and we ain’t gettin’ no help
‘Cause Superman ain’t comin’ so we gotta fend for ourselves
And uh - I’m all for setting goals, and trying to push the limit
But be realistic cause you know they say we are who we fuckin are
You might as well face it, cause if you can’t change it, then fuckin’ embrace it
‘Cause

[Chorus: Bennett, Chris Webby]
I'ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
I'ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
I'ma keep on livin’ this way
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
I’ma keep on livin’ this way
(So I gotta keep rollin’)

[Solo]

[Outro: Bennett, Chris Webby]
I’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
I’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
I’ma keep on livin’ this way
I’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful
‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day
I’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’
I’ma keep on livin’ this way
(So I gotta keep rollin’)
