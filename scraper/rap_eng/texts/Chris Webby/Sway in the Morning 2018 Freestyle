What’s the difference between me and you?
I mean, given the state of hip hop now, like
What’s the difference between me and you? A lot

I see my peers looking nervous as that jealousy takes charge on 'em
As i’m on a track like I’m assembling train cars and
I just hit ‘em with straight bars
The hyena’s back, Sway pulled me out the elephant graveyard
24 straight like a younger Jack Bauer
Finally I’m on and I’m abusing that power
Fuck your mom against the sliding doors of her glass shower
And grab her ass after hours like I’m Matt Lauer
I’m raps Bowser, the guy at the end of the game
That you’ll need cheat codes to beat, cause my pen is insane
Remember the name, C-Web I spit sickly
I got my competition breathing hard as Chris Christie
I get busy, currently they ain’t serving me
Get in they head like lobotomized surgery
‘Till they heard me, on a path that’ll further me
Fuck rap money, I’m copping some cryptocurrencies
Environmentally mindful
Donate to save the elephants
And yelling at people who don’t recycle
I’m spiteful, out-rapping each and every rival
Till the day I’m sitting on the title
See I’m so dope that you gon’ have to look
Beating me don’t ever happen
Like Lil’ Yachty reading chapter books
Mr. Babadook, I’m hopping right off of the page
Popping off like Call of Duty as I’m tossing grenades
And I’m sick of all these cats who try to defend mumble rap, “These old heads just don’t get it, they just some grumpy ass
Out of touch, motherfuckers stuck up in the fucking past”
I’m not even 30, and I think that shit is fucking trash
If you’re a rapper you should fuckin’ rap
Don’t say the same thing front to back on the whole fucking track
"Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang", really what the fuck is that?
I’ll say what everyone’s thinking: Lil’ Pump is wack
What you gonna do, come and battle me now?
Put some shit on wax, you know like real rappers get down?
But even thinking of that shit just got me laughing out loud
It’d only last one round and your ass would get clowned
The fact that you’re even labeled a rapper at all
Dishonors the forefathers of this whole entire genre
Sorry to diss you, there ain’t no personal issue
Just had to let you know that me and Sway ain’t fucking with you
And maybe that’s the biggest difference between me and you, and not just you Pump, see there’s plenty other dudes
Lil’ whats-his-name, with them face tattoos, who raps like you? yeah, fuck him too
See I love rap too much to watch these young cats destroy it, without speaking up it’s everywhere I can’t avoid it
I can’t hear the words when you do that with your voices
Maybe if I fucking understood it I’d enjoy it
But Jesus Christ
Every time I hear ‘em speak I’m like “yo, were you ever taught to read or write?”
And if not, then I feel like a jerk
And if you ever need a tutor i’d be happy to work
But stop the beat a minute, I got something to say
Sway, I wanna tell you this shit now
While you speaking with me
I don’t know if I ever told you this, but I love you dog
You know Webby got them raps
I wrote this shit just for you
So you could rack up hella views
And talk shit about people cause it’s something to do
I’m the type of guy to go live on Shade 45
And say I hope Mike Pence dies without batting an eye
Cause fuck ‘em
Trumps entire cabinet can suck one
And Hilary Clinton can be their plus one
I thought we’d get change when I voted for Barack
But at this point, next time I’m voting for The Rock
My punchlines provoke ‘em
Lyrics that’ll choke ‘em
With bars so sharp I cut through ‘em like Logan
Hulk Hogan, rocking triple wide Trojans
You gon’ leave this ring with your fucking spine broken
A rap genius, the meanest to hit your speakers
Like Eminem on his Slim Shady LP shit
Jesus, I be killing shit ‘till Hell freezes
Turning all the doubters to believers
So, what’s the difference between me and you?
About 6 Adderalls, two bottles, and Sway’s interviews
Until I get the worlds respect
I suggest you run in fear cause I am next
Yo that’s the difference
