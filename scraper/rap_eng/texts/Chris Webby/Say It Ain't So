[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Now please don’t believe what you see on TV
The chains and the vehicles these MCs be
Puttin’ in they videos seem all steazy
But seem is the key word there, believe me
It’s all just smoke and mirrors, shit ain’t what it appears
Rental chains along with the gold veneers
Just so it’s clear, car they whippin’ on screen, that ain’t what they drove in here
In the crib like they own that shit
Throwin’ bread around like they made all that money
While they actin’ like a pimp ‘round all these chicks
But every model on set been paid to act slutty
So ain’t all that funny? Now you all know
That everything that glitter ain’t gold
And every rapper sayin’ that they spendin’ that dough
Are only doin’ so until it gets repoed
Say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold

[Verse 2: Sap]
I be, crack a lash at you frauds on IG
First class combo, but you fly cheap
So why is you talkin’ fly to me?
I’m way ahead of you and walkin’ out of reach of them short arms
You can’t touch me, it must be ugly to see me up and living lovely
You rusty, might need to do new tools
We controllin’ the game, I’m talkin’ voodoo crew
I got a chance to peep under your hood, it wasn’t good
Say it ain’t so, yo’ fans just ain’t know
It’s so many places that you can’t go
Even when you grew up, damn, I thought you blew up
Guess you ain’t got the respect you said you had
Shittin’ on all of the people who fed your ass
Get a look in the mirror and never knowin’ what’s next
You made cash but your soul is in debt
Help me say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold

[Bridge: Chris Webby]
Bottles, bitches, lobster dinners
Multi-million dollar villas
Whips and diamonds, lots of scrilla
Photoshoppin’, crop it bigga
Racks all wrapped in rubber bands
Pinky rings on both they hands
Private jet to a crib on the sand
Till they get the knock from that repo man
Say it ain’t so

[Hook: Chris Webby]
Say it ain’t so, showin’ y’all if you ain’t know
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold
Woah, say it ain’t so, tellin’ you the way shit go
Woah, say it ain’t so, everything that glitter ain’t gold, woah
