[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
She only wears black, with her hair back
Pack of cigarettes up in her bra strap
Got me caught like I stepped in a bear trap
With that witchcraft, 'til I crawl back
When you're next to me, I'm in ecstasy
See the sorceress has got the recipe
Put a hex on me and it's left on me
So cruel with the lack of empathy
With that voodoo when you stick them pins in me, baby
I think I kinda like the injuries mixed with the misery
Trickery, wizardry, an app of witchery that you inflicted me
With the black magic, I'll be comin' back
Like a crack addict with a bad habit
Smokey eyes lookin' back at me, she'll be mad at it but

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused

[Verse 2: Rittz]
This girl is bad for me but naturally that's what attracted me
We fought, I thought it was just a passin' thing
But after weeks would pass, she got more attached
She's no longer lookin' at us as a fling
I seen it happenin' but can't resist a bitch
Wanted to tell her it's over but the minute that I get the nerve she starts to strip again
It's like a whippin' at a visit with a hypnotist
She use her lips to be manipulative
She told me I was in love, I told her bitch you wish
But truthfully ya'll becomin' a bit obsessed and it concerns me
Now I'm beginnin' to think that she's a wicked witch
I went in a room and all the wicks were lit on candles
In a circle with my picture in the middle
Scribble triple 6's, pentagrams and symbols written on the mirror

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Baby quick, let me closer
I'm tellin' you this chick is my controller
Tatts all up on her skin with a choker
Come and be the Harley Quinn to my Joker
Somethin' I never seen before
Every single time I hit, I'm fiendin' more
And my hands are always drawn to you (you, you, you)
Even when I'm using Ouija boards and I'm needin' more
'Cause you gotta be some type of venom
Check the toxicology, my curiosity is workin' constantly
She embodies the Sirens from The Odyssey
Until I'm wobbly, losin' my balance and you cast another spell
And then it's happenin' and runnin' through my body like a Pathogen and then I'm back again

[Chorus]
What should I do?
They invite me, excite me, their voodoo is taking control
Maybe it's cruel?
I won't fight it, I might even like it the deeper I go
I'm dazed and confused
I'm dazed and confused
