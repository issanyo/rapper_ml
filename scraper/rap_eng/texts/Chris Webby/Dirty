[Intro]

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You bite me, and I'll bite back
And I choke you, and you like that
Roll two joints and we light that
And you ain't gotta worry 'bout the price tag
And I ain't gotta ask how many dicks you've sucked
And you ain't gotta ask how many chicks I've fucked
And you ain't trynna have no kids I trust
OK then, let me grip that butt
Slow it down, but she wants it harder
Until we both sweatin' out Molly water
And with the shit I've seen, God bless any man that's got a daughter
'Cuz we are looking for some lovin', boys and girls alike
And I'm no Mr. Perfect but that ass gon' learn tonight
Give it to you how you want
Whether brunette or a blonde
I'm pulling chicks like James Bond
And baby you just turn me on
Like a light switch, can't hide it, 'cuz I read your mind like a psychic
And I know we get each other excited
So why not? Baby girl don't fight it
Don't fight it, and get in my whip
And you ain't gotta worry 'bout the mileage
And we headed back over to my crib
And fuck 'til we close our eyelids, baby...

[Hook: Sample]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
She got that black nail polish
Body like a goddess
What you got, I want it
And I'mma give it back good, I promise
With that cigarette between her lips
Tattoos running down her hips
You got me feeling frisky, baby, come get down with Chris
'Cuz I'm a dirty dog
Yes, I'm a tramp
Girls call me a slut
Dudes call me a champ
A master of persuasion
Girl, you don't stand a chance
Full plate got 'em quickly hoppin' right out their pants
Nibble on your earlobe
How you like it, let me know
Give it to you, nice and slow
Pick up the pace and then I go
Giggitty, Giggitty, Giggitty, Giggitty
Hit it so good you won't wanna get rid of me
Hit it like thowin' a pitch up in Little League
And you'll be face down in that pillow, see
Fucking while sipping my liquor, rolling that piff in a swisher
Baby, I'm big as the dipper, you better get ready 'cuz Webby ain't quick on the trigger
Bang

[Hook: Sample & Chris Webby]
(So let's get dirty)
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
(Yeah, let's get dirty)
They stare at me while I stare at you
(Hop up in my whip and let's get dirty)
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
(Bitch, let's get dirty)
One moment I have you the next you are gone
