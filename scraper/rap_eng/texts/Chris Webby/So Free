[Verse 1]
Yeah, see we all been through it
Weight on your shoulders, and can't move it
Just keep a firm grip on your soul, and you'll never lose it
'Cause money doesn't equal happiness, do not confuse it
And life is ruthless, get to walking if the shoe fits
'Cause everybody got a memory lane, but as you walking down it all you can remember is pain
The moments that, afterwards life was never the same
It's almost like something in your body chemically changed
Now you think the world's against you, I get you
Trust me I have been through, times I thought I'd never see an end to
When they said I couldn't, I just showed them what I can do
And ended up acquiring these jams that I lend you
It's not my duty to assemble a crowd
Gather a positive energy, spread it around
And as the vibrations join, they develop a sound
It's profound, turn that negative down
And I feel so free

[Verse 2]
Feeling really free, Ying and Yang: two sides living me
Working in synergy, I never let it hinder me
Always keep it balanced, you can check my alkalinity
I'm colder than the wintery mix, the slopes slippery
Keeping my aesthetic in line with the psychedelics
On my third eye, it's never wide shut
You can tell it's authentic, no synthetic, it's printed in my genetics
I am who I am, living unapologetic
We unique by design, be yourself at all times
Those that mind don't matter, those that matter don't mind
So, say what you feeling, and form your own opinions
We don't all have to agree, that's the beauty of being different
But ignorance is bliss, and awareness overwhelms us
It's easier to fall in line and follow what they tell us
But, never let up, be what you wanna be
Deep breaths
We'll be fine, you'll see
And I feel so free
