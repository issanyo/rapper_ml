[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been on my grind since I hustled twenty bags of piff
Now I'm trying to make a living off this rapping shit
Back in the day they all used to laugh and shit
Now they asking for a VIP pass and shit
Used to stay up all night and I practice it
Rhyme book up in my hand and a track to rip
You ain't even half the Chris, ask your bitch
Lean back, light it up, and relax a bit
I hit the bottom, now I'm living sick
Posted with a chick, EZ-Wider full of piff
That's enough to keep me happy so I'm living like this
Till I'm spending all my money and they put me in a ditch
We all gon' die, so while we still alive
I'm trying to get by, baby have a good time
Let me live it up, let me just grind
Go and live your life, homie let me live mine (ah)

[Hook Miss Daja]
On my grind x8

[Verse 2]
It's been a long hard road and a lot to go
[?] with the flow can't lock the can't block the blow
Trying to compare your mission is impossible
I'm just trying to make a living, can't knock it bro
Getting high man, chilling on the coast eating fried clams
Facebook hits from CT to Thailand
Went from no money, to having show money
Sved to the Ciroc and it's so lovely
No I don't Dougie, this is real rap
Suburbs to the block, gotta feel that
Since the White Noise fitted with the ear flaps
I've been on my grind none stop now a year passed
And I'm still going every day Webby (flowing ship?)
Moving at the speed of a NASCAR motorist
Time flies and we only getting older quick
So I'm here to party, yo enough with all the soberness

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've been dropping ill flows since I still rocked a diaper
More bars than Rikers, pull an all-nighter
With your chick big tits, looking foxier than Swiper
Hit then flip the TV on and play some Street Fighter
Living good with a dutchie and a lighter
Going too hard, baby put me in a cypher
Smoother than a cup of apple cider, dope rhyme writer
Grinding every day until I'm whipping in a Viper
That dude from Connecticut who got my name public
Following my dream and I mother fucking love it
If you got a dream go and make something of it
Because if you ain't doing what you love (then?) fuck it
Never let somebody tell you what you gotta be
Be yourself, have fun, live life, be free
But you gotta work for it, yo look at me
All I ever do is G-R-I-N-D (see)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah baby, I am x5
