[Intro: Madi Wolf]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life
Gather 'round and take a seat students, I'm your substitute for the night
'Cause you might think you're doin' it right, I thought it too
Up until I learned my lesson, now it's the lesson plan that I offer you
Study history, learn from the mistakes of those who came before you
So you can make it through life differently and take economics, a business class if you got it
Had to learn that for myself when people got up in my pockets
'Cause the school of hard-knocks is full of roadblocks and potholes
And semester after semester life is a long road
You gotta take some risks but if you livin' dangerous
Just know that there's consequences for the way you live
Because expulsion from life is permanent
Ain't no principals offices, church services
So for all my fallen classmates I tip this bottle of bourbon and pour it out
As I question what this life is all about
That's when they told me

[Chorus: Madi Wolf & Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up Welcome to the
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you gon' find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up

[Verse 2]
Gotta study psychology so you readin' people properly
And learn to see the world through the perspective of philosophy
I've always loved anatomy, I mean understandably
But I played it safe 'cause I ain't ready for family
'Cause I'm still working on myself and that's the mission
As taxes in my business' expenses became tuition
Ain't no wishin' on a star, real life comes at a cost
So crawl before you walk and listen more than you talk
Take your lessons as a blessing, raise ya hand and ask questions
We all got ADD but pay attention
No prisons or no testin' that could give you preparation
Live with zero hesitation, yo this life is what you make it
Gotta take it, any records that they set just go and break it
I'd rather have detention than follow and be complacent
'Cause when I hit my lowest and started losin' focus
And everything around me seemed hopeless
That's when they told me

[Chorus: Madi Wolf & Chris Webby]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up (Welcome to the)
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life, don't be surprised how
Now you're all grown up

[Outro: Madi Wolf]
Yeah, keep that sunshine on my side
So I know it's 'gon be alright, follow me and Ima be your guide
Leave your worries behind yeah
These mistakes that I'm takin' home
Taught me everythin' I know, Now I'm here to help you grow. whoah woah yeah

[Outro: Madi Wolf]
Welcome to the university of life now
If you didn't know before then you 'gon find out
This is real life.. don't be surprised how now your all grown up
