Read Chris Webby's Explanation of "Inebriated"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been up on cloud nine
So high I could never have down time
The liquor pourin's that brown kind
To the point that I'm not of sound mind
And got the white lines up on the counter top
And got a pound of crops, it's like a flower shop
Right in my house so stop, light up the sour pot
And get high till the ground is not
Under you no more, take your shoes on tour
Up and away till the roof's your floor
Sayin' to yourself I shouldn't do no more
But what's one more? You just chewed up four
Or was it five? Who knew, the effects were dead wrong
And you could really tell your head's gone
With even more psychedelics and medications lined up than an old school Eminem song
I'm feelin' myself, baby I'm feelin' myself, I do not need any help
Unless you want to get that jar full of weed on the shelf and if not then just keep to yourself
Burn till we fillin' up the room with vapors
Smoke right now then I'm boozin' later
Cup is so full that it's leakin' like Ashley Madison's god damn user data
I, light up my doobie till I'm high as Mount Fuji
I, got booze of several flavors mixed into my smoothie
I'm, Christian Belushi with a cruiser full of groupies
I, keep it groovy feelin' loopy cause you know that I am

[Hook: Chris Webby + Jaye Michelle]
So high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
.. Do ya feel me now
Drank a lot of liquor
No chaser makes it quicker
Rolled up twenties on the mirror
But I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated
I just can't help myself, I'm so inebriated

[Verse 2]
Now I don't support drug usage
I would never tell my fans that they should do it
But any adult can do whatever they want
And live life how he or she chooses
With that said, I'mma still have my fun
Occasionally when the work gets done
Not like it used to be, takin' two or three
Of whatever I could fit on my tongue
But shit I gotta let loose right?
So sometimes when the mood strikes
We gone buy some drugs, and line em up
And turn into a werewolf in the moon light
And the moon lookin' full tonight
Eyes dilatin' as the beast awakens
Feelin' like I just booked a flight
And we flyin' straight into inebriation
But personally, like currently
I just stick to whiskey and I burn some tree
Unless old habits pop back up but fuck, ain't nobody perfect, see
Everybody got flaws, you me and them too
Weed and them brews, lead to them moves
That you might regret but oh well, even if I wake up seemin' confused
I, light up my bubbler till my body feels like butter
I, got that sticky you gone wanna post on tumblr
I, be gettin' higher than a Michael Jordan jumper
Speakers be kickin' like Thumper I'm up in the club with a blunt and a cup then I light up another I'm
