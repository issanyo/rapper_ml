[Intro:]
Yeah, ha ha

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 1 - Chris Webby:]
I've been ready to go, full sprint, I'm ahead of the flow
Strap C-4 to my chest, know that Webby'll blow
I've had this mean demeanor in me since forever ago
Nothin' but green lights ahead, I push the pedal and go
A veteran pro, veins pump seven below
And will cruise until he got it, never settlin' so
I'm ready to go, movin' quickly in my pole position
No one holdin' Christian, more venomous than a cobra spittin'
Crush you, no position, with the illest and dopest rhythm
Cause they soft, weak-hearted and wack with no ambition
I'm Obi Wan Kanobi with the flow you can't control me
I'm a mixture of Paulie, Christopher, Sylvio and Tony
An honorary Soprano, with mono y mono
With Castallano, and hit 'em with a Liu Kang combo
Skin tone blanco
Though when I get up on the beat, I spit 'til I'm blue in the face lookin' like Ganzo

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 2 - Googie GoHard:]
Okay, what's good, Chris, thanks for lettin' me on this song
They'll catch a buzz for light-years, to infinity and beyond
My affinity falls, the liquor has been bitter sweet all along
Though to the best of my abilities, then breeze homie, I'm gone
Let's get it Webby, son, I'm ready to go
Just drop me off at the liquor store to get some Henny to pour
I hope in CT they got that good heady to smoke
(Shitstain) Well I'm dope, thanks for lettin' me know
I'm a cocky young wordsmith, stickin' to the cursin'
And tryna make my word fit in one of these bird's lips
I see you hawkin', pigeon for the squawkin'
But when I give her the rooster she diggin' them eagle claws in
I'm leaving with back scratches, bruises and open gashes
Jesus, I'm looking like Christ from the Passion
Rock new clothes but a nigga old-fashioned
Hit it, then she runnin' back, yeah, Bo Jackson

[Hook:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 3 - Chris Webby:]
Yeah, yeah, I'm not like these punks who lack hustle
I'm big, they weaker than Stephen Hawking's calf muscles
Nothin' but trouble with a dub up in my bubbler
Hotter than summer under a Goosedown comforter
Hennessy up in my cup still I never stutter words
THC runnin' through my jugular, fuckin' serve
Anybody who thinks I'm just a gimmick, I spit it how I live it
That's why everyone on Twitter had to click it
I'm the raider of the lost ark
Make the DJ bring it back like a false start
This ain't a fallacy, my dude, cause I can truly flow
And play the hand I was dealt, somethin' like Yu-Gi-Oh
Since a long time ago, spittin' freestyle or flow
Drunk with a pen in my hand like Edgar Allen Poe
And I won't stop 'til I'm a millionaire
Put the pieces together, bitch, Build-A-Bear

[Hook x2:]
Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Outro:]
