[Intro]
Its Chris Webby, yeah
Asher Roth ain't the only college boy on this rapping shit
And I love college too, shit, heh

[Hook 1]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany, and shots of Soco so it's whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I love college even more than Asher
Different chick every other night come home plastered
Somehow pass class and twist blunts after
I'm Hofstra's top dog and homecourt rapper
Fitted pointed backwards, spittin' that fire
The shit on campus bitch ask Van Wilder
Don't need a reminder to party everyday
Cause I'm an alcoholic, I remember anyway
I've been drunk since 12, mothafuck a drinkin' age
Walk in a liquor store, take my wallet out to pay
Clerk tellin' me I'm not who I say I be
Even though it says I'm Spanish on my fake ID

[Hook]
That party last night was awful nuts bro, wish I remembered
But I took a Xany and shots of Soco so its whatever
Roll my blunts and pop my E
Now chug that 40 just like me
Pass out at 6, wake up at 3
Then do it again, tonight drinks on me, man I love college
And I love boozin', and I love bitches, I love college

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
They say drugs make you dumb, but I don't think they do
Last semester, I pulled a fuckin' 3.2
When I wakeup's, the only time I'm sober enough
To do homework unless I'm hungover as fuck
And still there ain't even a teacher that can hold me
Go to class blunted, lookin' somethin' like Spicoli
Or I just pull a Ferris Bueler, skip the whole day
I'm just here for the party and I hope that's okay
But there's no way to stop me, this sophomore's a monster
Even though I'll end up doin' 6 years at Hofstra
Sit back, sippin' on a beer with a mic
Knowing these are gonna be the best years of my life, right?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
I'm a flip-cup phenomenon, beer pong pro
Hit all 10 in a row with my fuckin' eyes closed
A little bend of the knees and a flick of the wrist
Have you chuggin' every second while I'm sippin' my shit
Dutch Master always full of some ridiculous piff
That got me twisted like a licorice stick
Listen to this, my time is never wasted cause I'm always wasted
I fuckin' love college, that's all I can say kid

[Hook]
