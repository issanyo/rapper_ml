See I been grindin' for a long time man...
But I'm here now--there goes the neighborhood I guess

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see I'm here to save the day with this music
Grindin' till the point I think I'm really going to lose it
But I won't lose nothing! They tryna step to me but shit
You think you could do better with it homie, then go and do somethin!
Uh! They tryna tell me I'm crazy, but shit I'm crazy good
Step into your city they saying, "There goes the neighborhood"
For Sale signs go up soon as I show up
They building bomb shelters cause they know I'm gonna blow up
Uh! Bright future they say I'm a ticking time-bomb
Until I'm up on MTV waving, saying, "Hi Mom"
Grab your video cameras and get your Nikons
Making history from the second they flip the lights on
I made it off being business savvy and street smart
Who needs a co-sign? I let them beats talk
I don't need another rapper lendin' help
Tellin' listeners I'm dope as shit, I'll tell'em that myself
I'm just playing what I'm dealt
Shit it's been a long road but I got alot under my belt
And I've felt, at times, it was a lost cause
But I always got back up on my paws dawg
So I know I'm gonna make it in the long haul
Shit, it's now or never homie! I cannot stall
So I'm gonna reach up for the stars and I'll pray for the best
And that's how it's gonna be until the day of my death. Word

[Hook: A. Mitch]
Just play and tune into this music
Have no fear I'll save the day with this music
My city on my back and I'mma take it
Whereever I go, wherever I go (x2)
Say hello to the new guy in town
"There goes the neighborhood" is what they say

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
Twelve years in the making, far from immediate
But it's now to sink my teeth in it, I'm on my beastly shit
Cause I'm sick as fuck, you don't believe me bitch?
Then go ahead and spit that semen on a petri dish
You need sterilizer just to give me dap
Unless you want your immune system attacked, real rap
I'm not doing no duggie
These fuckin' idiots should drop the swag and take notes
Cause they could learn something from me
This is all I do man, murder instrumentals
With this fire off the top like Sweet Tooth in Twisted Metal
Spittin rebel with a cause, deadly with the bars
Underdog since day one, wasn't expecting your applause
I respect your damn opinion if you don't like my music
But if you don't repect my hustle, then you ain't paying attention
I pay so many fucken dues my wallets empty
Ain't a person here stoppin' Webby. Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
Fucken animal, Webby's the Sarenghetti type
They whippin Lambos but I made it on a peddled bike
Not even Gatorade replenishes electrolytes
I burn growin' up from the fucken second I get the mic
I'm the grittiest, grimiest, and the wittiest
Jack the Ripper to the beats I'm gettin' busy with
And half these rapper idiots aren't even literate
I'm battle tested and ready, Webby a young Odysseus
Fire in my eyes and a hunger for success
I'm huntin' for the title while they huntin' for check
Wondering what's next but I'm going in fist swingin'
Till your ears ringin' they don't expect what this kid's bringin'
So if you didn't notice, so homie just don't provoke it
I got my state on my shoulders till I'm getting scoliosis, never gonna stop
My life's like the script of Verticle Limit motherfucker, I'm getting to the top!

[Hook]
