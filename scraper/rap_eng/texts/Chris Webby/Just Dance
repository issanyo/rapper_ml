[Intro]
Yo!
Chris Webby
Who else you know is about to go rap over some Lady Gaga?
Yo for real
I go hard

[Verse]
Just dance, dance, hold it down
Didn’t think I’m ill? Well you know it now
What’ll come, around goes around
That’s why I hit ‘em with the dopest sound
Flowin’ now got a dub to twist
And not even Ron Jeremy can fuck with this
Cause I’m fuckin’ sick, so who’s touchin’ Chris?
Treat a chick like an Oreo and double dip
Because I’m white as a glass of milk and I’mma rap until
The sun comes up, Massive skill
What I got ? so I don’t gotta brag I’m ill
But I still do when I’m drunk on a bag of pills
Cause I rap shit hotly, everybody watch me
Cause I love attention and nobody can stop me
Go against me, then I’m like John Gotti
And you will get taken care of like Tamagotchi
So sick that they think I’m a zombie, gee whiz Gaudi
I’m so godly, rollin’ with my homeboy Abi
So you know I’mma do what I gotta do hard body
I’m the shit need a potty
Probably do it all in front of your eyes like Hibachi
Roll the dice like Yahtzee, got more balls than Botchi
I’m rollin’ out top speed, and I’m callin’ out shotty!
No blitz, bitch no this, I’m so sick if you didn’t notice
You don’t know what I been through did you
But I still keep it cooler than an igloo
And I don’t gotta be a big dude
I’m still a Pitbull and you’re a Shih Tzu
So strong I could lift you, pick you
Up and drop you, don’t even need to hit you
Grapple rappers, put ‘em on the ground
Pin ‘em real quick no need for a second round
I was a yellow belt at 6 holdin’ it down
Now takin’ over town by town
Wow, Let me just smash the set
And find me a little bachelorette
And I’mma bring her back to the sac and sex
Well see how the action gets
Then round two if she pasts the test
Spit with a cleverly skilled mixture
Big as the Beverly hills ninja (hiya!)
Rollin’ up the windows, Light the L
Puff puff pass till we gettin' high as hell
Kill ’em with the wordplay nice as well
Will I get signed soon? only time will tell
But I’m kickin’ it for now and I love that
Postin’ up at the crib like a Rugrat
Now where the dutch at, fuck that

[Outro]
I’m ill, Chris Webby bitch
You better remember that damn name
Shit. And I’m out!
