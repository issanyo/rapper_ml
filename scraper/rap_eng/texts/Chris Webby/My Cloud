[Verse 1]
Catch me where the red ferns grow
Smokin' bud that burns slow
So turn the damn dial if your speakers turned low
Cause everything I'm doin' is loud
I'm just chillin' on a mothafuckin' cumulus cloud
I stay high!
Up in the galaxy like Pluto Nash
Stupid ass thinkin' any one in your crew's gon' last
But you knew those facts -
I'm the dog that whipped Pugo's ass
Fat bud, call it sumo grass
So you better give me kudos fast
Won't stop till I got that Borat n Bruno cash
I'm a box office success, puffin' the best
Got that Godzilla, green
Same color as Shrek
So lets throw it in a Dutchy or Philly or EZ Wider
Bong, bowl, bubbler, hookah, or vaporizer
Maybe throw yourself a batch of brownies in
As long as we be gettin' high count me in, ay!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm just livin' on a cloud
Chillin' in the sunshine
I got a dub n a dutch
I think its blunt time
Eyes bloodshot, contacts dry
Wear my sunglasses even when I'm inside
I'm high -
Like the THC in my system
My weed is medicine
I need it for living
I twist up my words while I speed up the rhythm
Because I be high as fuck 'n I don't need your permission
I'm twistin', burnin' on a cloud
Smokin' on a joint that would make Bob Marley proud
Jam with the Buffalo Soldiers
Chillin', let me stir it up
Trench Town Rockin' on a beat then I burn it up
You better learn your stuff, beware
I'm just a kid who didn't pay attention in D.A.R.E.,
I've been high all day since eighth grade
Stay blazed off that grade-A haze and AK, hey!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rollin' up an eighth of grass
Any time I blaze a track
Cause I stay burnin' like a fuckin' pyromaniac;
Keep at least an ounce where I'm stayin' at
Dutch in the whip, puffin some piff
Who fuckin' with Chris?
(Nobody)
Anywhere I go, you know I got some pot
Green with orange hair like Roger Klotz
Got that Carrot Top drop
No stems, no seeds
Takin' bong rips to see if you can OD
But you can't, all you get is a cough 'n real hungry
Tearin' the fuck outta the fridge with the munchies
Pass out in boxers in front of the TV then
Wake up at like three PM
Then its wake 'n bake time
So roll yourself a joint
Cause if you're not high
Then whats the fuckin' point?
My heads in the clouds
I'll never be sober
I'll be a pot head till its over
