[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)
(I'm the man behind the science)
(And Webby's the supplier)
See that he be sampleing the instruments
I pack it and distribute it to give you that fire
(Ay yo, we stay cooking up)
(We stay in the lab, we turn up the heat)
(Keep playing it back so really none of y'all can't stress me)
He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!

[Verse 1: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
I was chilling up in South Beach kicking my feet up
Just got off tour trying to soak some UV's up
Album on the source, label situation freezed up
Then I saw Sap tweet, he was trying to cook some beats up!
Shit, that sounds right, look, I'mma grab the Jamo
Then I got the flight book, go and catch your plane bro!

(On my way Chris, you know that shit we make is so pure
Some of this clowns think they run us and they so sure
Cause when I'm here in the streets got me so bored
The fans don't need to hear no more
But hey we gon chop the world after this shit we pull
Do it for the check but first for the people
I always hear the question, "why Web ain't made freshman?"
Man you know how geeks in school be keeping seats full
So we skip class, quick fast, and hit the jaw
Zip back on some Chemically Imbalanced!)
For your bitch ass!
So wait a minute while we go and hit the skyline
Cause I'm gone, the only way to go is to the dark side
I do whatever I like, now it's a whole CD
Me and Sap up on the track it's so eazy!

[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)
(I'm the man behind the science)
(And Webby's the supplier)
See that he be sampleing the instruments
I pack it and distribute it to give you that fire
(Ay yo, we stay cooking up)
(We stay in the lab, we turn up the heat)
(Keep playing it back so really none of y'all can't stress me)
He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!

[Verse 2: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
Yo, Mr. White I need a beat!

(Webb I got you, get used to add an extra knock too, you know I got to
We 'bout to have the whole world buying this!)

Word? Lemme try a hit! Yeah, Science Bitch!

(You see we take a piece from the sample
Ain't a damn thing with my beats that we can't do
Got so many styles that we gon' have a handful
Of this customers I swear the whole net gon' fuck with us)

You call it the Internet, but I call it the trap
I push my product on the book, the gram and snapchat
When I run out, I pick up my phone and ask Sap
And we cooking it well, getting mail from ASCAP
Selling tapes out the trunk, then they gotta love bigger
Now the fans lining up hitting follow on twitter
I'mma DM this chick real quick, I'm trynna hit, you dig?

(Come on Webb you know we on the clock nigga!)

[Chorus: Chris Webby & (Sap)]
(Now you may know me as Sap)

He got the beats, I got the bars
And when you put that shit together we are like Walt and Jesse!
