[Chorus]
It's just one those days where you don't wanna wake up, everybody sucks
It's just one those days where you don't wanna wake up, everything is fucked
It's just one of those days
It's just one of those days
Damn right I'm a maniac!
Damn right I'm a maniac!

[Verse 1: Danimal Letor]
It's one of those days, the blood in my veins is full of hunger and rage
And these drugs ain't numbing the pain
I'm underground like the runaway slave
That's something to say
Better pick your words wisely or I'll chisel them on your fucking grave
Hundreds of ways i could release this frustration
Hit the beat like fuck waiting
Or proceed to punch your face in
I ain't eating up at Nathan's but I'm hot, dog
Chop off your tongue and drown you in hot sauce
Going hard even when my cock's soft
Your not raw knock it off
Move when i say so
Swinging 'till there's lights out
Like it's (?) at (?) glow
Better lay low,,
You may know
I never been to rock a halo
It's either horns, I'm not the norm
Brain storm a tornado
Like a make-over(?) with the great white's bite fear redefined
Tryna be a part of my life now? Your years behind
I got them sweet 16's, Mr. full clip
It's all about the 'he says', 'she says' bullshit

[Chorus]

[Verse: Chris Webby]
My alarm's going off and it's fucking early
My mouth is dry as shit, feeling hungover and dirty
Couldda slept till 4:30 but there's stuff to do
Roll off the wrong side of the bed like it's nothing new
I wanna take a bong rip but I can't find all my weed
My text message is full of shit that I ain't trying to read
Go to get some food but the local diner was closed
Shit just ain't going my way today but fuck it though
I'mma go and get some gas cos my tanks on E
Get out to pay and drop my phone, Whattya know? I cracked the screen
Well I went inside to get some bogies and I got in line
When i went to buy 'em, just my luck, the cards declined
Well isn't that special? No one fuck with me today
If today was a person then I would punch it in the face
In a bad mood dude, get the fuck up out my way
This isn't my day
That's all that i can say

[Chorus]
