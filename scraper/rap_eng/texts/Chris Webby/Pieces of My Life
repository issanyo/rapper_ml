[Intro]
Everyboy got a story man, this is mine

[Verse 1]
See I been walking on this tightrope, feeling like it's life or death
Music is my life though, all I need's a quiet set
To go under those headphones, write a couple rhymes and vent
Only time I feel like I've actually got my mind in check
Listen to music til I was losing all my sense of stress
Everything just melts away, my problems went ahead and left
Tapped into my brain and now it's working like Professor X
Got some rapping superpowers, never give the pen a rest
Grew up bumping DMX, Eminem, and Red & Meth
Ludacris and Tip brought the south up to Connecticut
Back when Wu-Tang was telling people to protect they neck
When I discovered rap, and I ain't left it yet
I was just a crazy kid, just tryna find my way
Now these people listen what I look into the mic and say
Now it's flipped around cause I'm the music that these kids will play
Just like how I was bumping Big and Dre, shit how crazy is that

[Hook]
Started out as just a kid who could rap
But now it's gotten so much bigger than that
Now that I got it ain't no giving it back
So now it's time to take my victory lap
Since I started knew my life would be different
Cause it's my dream and I've been dying to live it
I've been out here paying dues
But you know that's just the price of admission
So just appreciate these pieces of my life when I spit it

[Verse 2]
Yeah this music is my lifeline, use it as a getaway
Since I first started really learning in seventh grade
Wrote the words to "Renegade", Em and Jay, on the wall of my college room
So I would look up to it every day
I've been on that shit, making records, rehearsing
And now it's time for the Wizard to go and step from the curtain
I shed my, blood and my tears and all of my sweat from the working
I spent all of my younger years tryna' perfect what I turn in
To be listened to and critiqued by anybody who's surfing the internet
But remember I'm a regular person
Whose parents bought him CD's, and they would check for the cursing
So I was stuck listening to The Chronic Edited Version
Til I took em both aside, said mommy you gotta see
This hip-hop shit is me, and it's always gonna be
And now all these years later and they truly believe
That this the life I was meant to lead, real shit

[Hook]

[Outro]
You know for a true artist, someone who really cares about what they do
There's nothing that comes before the music
Cause the music, in essence, is really just an extension of that person
It doesn't matter what color you are, where you come from, what religion you look to during hard times, good music is good music
And it's easy to get sidetracked by the money and the women
And everything else that comes along with fame
But I'm in this for the music, at the end of the day this is my dream
You know, making music is therapy for me
And I'll never let anything get in the way of that, never
