[Chris Webby Talking]
Yeah, we all get to that point in our life ya know
Shit really hits the fan and everything seems like it sucks
But ya know, you always gotta think everything happens for a reason
Ya know what I'm sayin'? Chyeah

[Verse 1:]
Everybody make mistakes, I'm the first to admit it
But once you make a choice you're forced to live with it
Some people never get it till they live it
And then when they live it
There's not a chance that they ever could forget it
You wish that you could switch it
Waitin' on that lawyer visit
Now the old me's dead and gone
Like I had Timberlake to spit it
The way I had been livin' my life just wouldn't cut it
Head always in the clouds with an attitude like "Fuck it"
But that's just immaturity and surely I figured out thoroughly
That that was only hurtin' me
Now I need a purposely
Get my life back on track and leave some things in the past
It's as simple as that, yeah

[Hook:]
Some people say that I'm not worth it
I made mistakes but nobody's perfect
I guess I'll give it a try

I got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes you need to realize you got one last chance
When the outcome of your life rests within a judge's hands
And I'll never understand how one man with a gavel
Can decide if your future is worth being unraveled
Or take away your paddle and send you right down shits creek
For as long as the dude sees fit
See it's a tough ass world that we live in
You could find yourself in prison over one wrong decision
It's difficult to get this shit outta your mind
Wish you could just press rewind, go back in time
But I've accepted that I need to find the bright side
Cause often the dark is the only thing in sight
I'll find that silver lining cause I gotta keep on grindin'
And until I reach the top you know I gotta keep on climbin'
One setback won't stop me
I'm still here breathin'
Believin' that even this shit happened for a reason

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
And I don't wanna be misunderstood (you gotta understand me)
I got to take this chance
And make it into something good, oh (you gotta always find the bright side)
Some people say that I'm not worth it (nah)
Made mistakes but nobody's perfect (nobody)
I guess I'll give it a try (I'm a try, Lord knows I'm a try)

I got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never [2x]
And I try to remember who I used to be
I got one last chance to get myself together

I got one last chance (yeah, I got one last chance)
And so it's all I need, one last chance

[Chris Webby Talking]
Sometimes, you just gotta change everything up
Grow the fuck up, ya know
You can always bounce back
Ha, ha, ha, ha
It's Chris Webby
