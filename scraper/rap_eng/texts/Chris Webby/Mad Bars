Yeah, this shit right here is for all the haters
Alright, everybody sayin', "Yo dude, you can't spit."
And I'm like, I'm like, "Yo fuck that I can spit!"
Ha. So uh, let me just lay down mad bars
Yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
I'll spit a whole bunch of bars, re-roll up cigars
I am greater than the rest Supernova, the stars
You're just the common cold I am SARS
I do not spar, every single blow will hit hard
And I know what you are and hm, you're not me
Outdo you in anything bitch, just watch me
Drop shit on any topic, hotness
Then swap spit with hot chicks and get my cock licked
I'm a rot pit mixed with a little bijon
Hugh Hef in the flesh, Stay rollin' with three blondes
So don't hate this, I can't help that I'm great bitch
I spit a rhyme and then I'm outtie, Like an A6
I make hits and I hit the marijuana
Then beat the shit out of Rihanna just because I wanna
Haha, Nah, I ain't Chris Brown, I am Chris Web
CT is listenin' to everything this kid says
The only time I get bread's at a meal
Before my main course, god damn I need a deal
I'm broke out on bail and I'm livin' with my parents
But I spit, and got these high school girls starin'
Darin' to be different, apparently it's rhythm
That's keepin' me goin' every moment that Webby be spittin'
Spittin' like I got a loogie stuck in my throat
But fuck it I'm dope, the ring leader's runnin' the show
So ring around the rosie with a pocket full of OC's
Pop 'em all at once and OD
Oh me! Oh my! So high! I don't even want to land
Contraband in my waistband, rip it cause I can
Half man, Half ninja turtle
Half a fuckin' head case
If I don't make it on the mic I'll make a sex tape
Me, Kim Kardashian, and Paris in a three way
Burn it right to disk and make a million off of Ebay
I got true blood runnin' in my veins
Sharper than a vampire's fangs
Bang! Sneeze a lightnin' bolt, cause I'm always spittin' thunder
Runnin' shit like Ari, cause drama like Vince's brother
Smoother than butter with a pocket full of rubbers
And skills that'll make your girl s-s-s-s-stutter
Back up in this m-motherf-fucker with a vengeance
Make 'em pause like they got a comma in their sentence
You can tell I'm the shit as soon as I hit the entrance
Fuck the shampoo, we that rollin' that Herbal Essence
Cause I'm great like Alexander
Two Poke balls hangin', spit flames like Charmander
And I got your chick wetter than a Blastoise
She said I'm sexy and she love my raspy ass voice
I'll turn the stage into a slaughter house, ask Royce
Fuckin' with Webby is just a bad choice!
I'm a mothafuckin' goblin man
Get the cable vision rhythm, rippin' on demand
You can see me with the mic on my sonogram
The doc was like "hm, I think we've got a problem ma'am"
Had a rattle in my right hand, dutchie in the other kid
Diaper on my ass, thirty rack up in the fuckin' crib
Had 'em sayin' "what the fuck is up?"
Cause all I do is fill up cups and puff a dutch
Rollin' with a crew of giants like Justin Tuck
So if you really wanna step, better muscle up
Cause I really got to show 'em when enough's enough
Cause now these rappers trying to bite me like Scruff McGruff
Gotta get these damn dogs euthanized
I am back ill as can be, and super-sized
Like Star Fox, I am truly fly
Can't do what I do, excuse you I
Be runnin' shit with my manager younger than me
And I'm young as fuck, and still nobody fuckin' with me
I am in A&R's wet dream ready for the shit
Cause the games a fuckin' rap when they let Webby in this bitch

Because the game's a fucking rap
When they let Webby in this bitch. [x2]

Yeah, you know, mad bars
Maaaad bars
Spit straight on any mixtape
I'm ill, yeah, what
