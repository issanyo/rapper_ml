[Intro:]
Is this what you want from me
You don't wanna do it
You know what it's gonna be
Don't fuck up my mood right now
It's not what you want (not what you want)

[Verse 1]
If I hit your chick up and she pick up
She Uber to my crib without a hiccup
Using all the data sendin' pictures
Titties out with them mad shots, with her mans house the backdrop
No she ain't never been one for discreetness
We get it poppin', she hop up out them Vicky Secrets
Yeah she gon' come in up again in like a prefix
And by the end of that she can't walk right, on site, all bright
Bongs, pipes, Raw's tight, little black fog lights, all night
Jaw like Cujo, dog bights, you might just wanna run now
√Åndale, duck down, I'm on the way
Touchdown, get-get what now? (get-get what now?)
So high, never come down

[Chorus]
Is this what you want from me?
'Cause I'll give it to ya right now
You don't wanna do it
I can see through you right now
You know what it's gonna be
I'm chillin, I'm cool right now
Don't fuck up my mood right now
That's not what you want (not what you want)

Is this what you want from me?
'Cause I'll give it to ya right now
You don't wanna do it
I can see through you right now
You know what it's gonna be
I'm chillin, I'm cool right now
Don't fuck up my mood right now
That's not what you want (not what you want)

[Verse 2]
New flow, new bitch, two-tone new whip
Ya'll cannot reach me, new phone, who dis? (Hello?)
Ya that price gon' go up, ain't no coupon for this
With my sidepiece like a car fender when I bag her and the bartender
See I been pushin' steady through the long base
All I hear up in my mind is how these songs play
So I'm channeling the spirit of Harambe
Ya, I'm a killa gorilla, Attila, Godzilla and everything else in the middle
I think of a plan, like Killer Cam
Get paid in full and hit Miami just to get a tan
My Swisher crammed with the goodies, like 11 grams
They hatin' on me, that's just some shit I just cannot stand
Lieutenant Dan

[Outro:]
Is this what you want from me?
'Cause I'll give it to ya right now
You don't wanna do it
I can see through you right now
You know what it's gonna be
I'm chillin, I'm cool right now
I fucked up my mood right now
That's not what you want (not what you want)

Is this what you want from me?
'Cause I'll give it to ya right now
You don't wanna do it
I can see through you right now
You know what it's gonna be
I'm chillin, I'm cool right now
I fucked up my mood right now
That's not what you want (not what you want)
(If I hit your chick up and she pick up... Hello? Hello?)
(If I hit your chick up and she pick up... Hello?)
