[Intro]
Yeah! It's Chris Webby
Up in Webster's Laboratory right now, you know
Just cooking some shit up!
As I said, bars for days
Let's go

[Verse 1]
First of all, shout to Chiddy Bang yo
But it’s Webby and I still be Off The Chain, so
I’ll get your girl and do what you seeing on Bang Bros
Stacking YouTube hits like a double rainbow
So fresh, got a Old Spice old feel
Tryna stay on course like a boat's keel
They wanna know how I be killin’ it with no deal
And got the game mapped out, Michael Scofield
No prison break, get up here and renovate
Every venue that I’m hittin’ up in every state
Twist a zig-zag then I levitate
Webby been bad, professor Snape
I’m like Manny Pacquiao times four
Hyping up the crowd when I’m out on tour
I need a dollar like I told you before
So I could cop an Arnold Palmer when I’m hittin’ the store
Encore, I used to pop pills, always puffin’ bud
I think I’m still rollin’, Team Pup N’ Suds
Now I’m going big time and I’m lovin’ this
When I step in, dudes better cuff your chick
I don’t speak game, I say a couple words
Next thing you know we’re both under the comforter
In the comfort of my hotel suite
Having sloppy drunk sex and forget 'em by next week
I’m a beast, reppin’ Connecticut like a husky
CT swag, everybody here loves me
Got a stainless steel flow, never spit it rusty
Running shit like Nucky, trust me
Name buzzin’ all over the fuckin’ country
Shout to my ninjas and everybody who bumps me
So just feed me beats, I got the munchies
Nothing better than an instrumental when I’m hungry
The illest thing that ever hit pro tools
I’m 1-51, they just O'Doules
Live by no rules, no one’s stoppin’ me
They say Webby rocks, Geology
Even haters gotta bump my shit
So what, thanks for the YouTube hits you dumb bitch
Put me in the mix, I’ma be the last spittin’
I’m a tiger, y’all domesticated cat, kitten
You’ll get smacked kitten, left there with your cash missin’
It’s a fact, listen, I’ll be on a track rippin’
Haters crack jokes, I just laugh with ‘em
And get loud, like Waka Flocka ad-libing
Spit venom out, every time I rap rhythms
Webby’s the deadliest catch, I’m goin’ crab fishin’
Teachin’ hip-hop 101, so take notes
Bring it back, mu'fucker I’m done
