[Intro]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I don't want no problems man
I just wanna, hey

[Chorus]
I just wanna have a good day (good day)
Good day (good day), good day (good day)
I said I just wanna have a good day (good day)
Good day (good day), good day (good day)
All my niggas we be gettin' paid (gettin' paid)
Gettin' paid (gettin' paid), gettin' paid (gettin' paid, hey)
We been in the trap all day (all day)
All day (all day), all day (all day)

[Verse]
Monday through Sunday, bitch we be trappin' (trappin')
If we talkin' gunplay, pistols get to clappin' (clappin')
Thinkin' 'bout the days when a nigga wasn't rappin' (word)
We was robbin', straight jackin', tryin' to make some shit happen (rrah, rrah, doon doon doon)
Keep the last joint 'cause I like that (I like that)
I'ma hit your bitch like a blunt, she don't fight back (she don't fight back)
I can't even stunt, why you wifed that? (why you wifed that?)
If you was a nigga like me you one night that (you wouldn't wife that)
Say I'm triflin' (look triflin')
But I keep on comin' back like I'm recyclin' (I'm 'cyclin')
I'ma put my hands on you like I'm typin' (like I'm typin')
Bitch I'm Mike Tyson (huh?)
Now your girlfriend tryna break it up like, damn why y'all fightin'? (no)

[Chorus]
I just wanna have a good day (good day)
Good day (good day), good day (good day)
I said I just wanna have a good day (good day)
Good day (good day), good day (good day)
All my niggas we be gettin' paid (gettin' paid)
Gettin' paid (gettin' paid), gettin' paid (gettin' paid, hey)
We been in the trap all day (all day)
All day (all day), all day (all day)
