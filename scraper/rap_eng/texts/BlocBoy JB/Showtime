[Intro]
Showtime
Showtime, go time, we see no stop signs
Nigga tried to take mine, left his ass clotheslined
Three Glocks, four nines, nigga come in that's showtime
That's showtime

[Chorus]
Showtime, go time, we see no stop signs (word)
Nigga tried to take mine, got his ass clotheslined (clotheslined)
Three Glocks, four nines, sneak 'em in the showtime (showtime)
Showtime, dough time, time to hide your ho time (ho time)
Showtime, go time, we see no stop signs (stop sign)
Nigga tried to take mine, got his ass clotheslined (clotheslined)
Three Glocks, four nines, sneak 'em in the showtime (yeah)
Showtime, dough time, time to hide your ho time (word)

[Verse]
Baby girl I'm a player like I'm UVL
In her hair like some gel, try me catch a shell
Even though we can make bail we still run from 12
Big street, bro can send an L, we don't fuckin' care
Shh, keep it quiet ho
How I'm feeling I just might start up a riot ho
My lil Haitian in here, brought him through the side door
He be murkin' shit, that lil nigga stand 'bout five four
We do drive-bys, y'all chicken like Popeye's
I sell you like Five Guys, I call up my five guys
And we gon' go hit some shit
With thirties and fifty clips
Them bullets won't miss a bit 'cause we don't leave your innocents
Eight cars pull up, we shootin' and hittin' everything
AR's, handguns, and Uzis, bitch we got everything
Play hard, boy your ass stupid just like the mary jane
Shooting shit, like Call of Duty we hittin' everything (word)

[Chorus]
Showtime, go time, we see no stop signs (word)
Nigga tried to take mine, got his ass clotheslined (clotheslined)
Three Glocks, four nines, sneak 'em in the showtime (showtime)
Showtime, dough time, time to hide your ho time (ho time)
Showtime, go time, we see no stop signs (stop sign)
Nigga tried to take mine, got his ass clotheslined (clotheslined)
Three Glocks, four nines, sneak 'em in the showtime (yeah)
Showtime, dough time, time to hide your ho time (word)
