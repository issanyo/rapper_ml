Hah, hah, hah
Cut that shit down, cut that shit down, hah
Cut that shit down, cut that shit down, hah
Cut that shit down

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB & Sade]
(Cherish the day), cherish the day
(Won't go astray), won't go astray
(Won't be afraid), won't be afraid
(Won't catch me runnin'), won't catch me runnin'
(Cherish the day), cherish the day
(Won't go astray), won't go astray
(Won't be afraid), won't be afraid
(Won't catch me runnin'), won't catch me runnin'

[Verse]
Where was you at when slept on the mats up in the living room?
Nigga dissin', load up the MAC, he won't be living soon
Opposition knock off his hat, now he up in the tomb
Make a nigga brain go splat like it was Looney Tunes
Glock on my liver, bust shots at a nigga (rrah)
If you play you get popped, including your niggas (word)
Niggas see you gettin' money and try to get with you (yeah)
We ain't recruitin' no niggas, we shootin' like pictures (that's on my mama)
Sippin' lean out a pitcher, up on some Texas shit
Man I'm at these niggas necks like they necklaces
Shawty gave me head, man that shit was excellent (word)
Then she drank my nut like two or three beverages, huh (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB & Sade]
(Cherish the day), cherish the day
(Won't go astray), won't go astray
(Won't be afraid), won't be afraid
(Won't catch me runnin'), won't catch me runnin'
(Cherish the day), cherish the day
(Won't go astray), won't go astray
(Won't be afraid), won't be afraid
(Won't catch me runnin'), won't catch me runnin'
