[Verse 1]
I want em dead
Nigga better not let me find em (find em)
Fill em up with lead
You might think the bullets signed them (signed em)
Dropping like a tape
Ain't no way you can't rewind
Shoot them like a game you might think [?]
I got that bag so you know I act an asshole (asshole)
[?] mojo (mojo)
I don't do security I might hit the club solo (what)
Nigga try to rob me, put 8 in him thats a ocho

[Chorus]
Down bad trying to hit a lick lick lick lick
I was trafficking the cash with the stick stick stick stick stick
Gotta 30 in the mag imma hit hit hit hit
Bitch you know I keep the cannon call me Nick Nick Nick Nick

[Verse 2]
On my feet cause I'm throwing these bullets (bullets)

[Refrain]
Crip, crip crip crip

[Verse 3]
Wonder what time you niggas gonna ride
This ain't baseball we don't let shit slide
Niggas see you get money they try and switch slides
Hell naw [?]
