[Verse 1]
Won a BET, I got my strap in the award shows
Diamonds up on Ten-Seventeen, Gucci and Pablo
Fresh in Versac-o
Chain, it's a light show
Try to take it from me, I'ma stomp you like a cockroach
Gu-Gu-Gucci boots, that's at least twelve-hunnid
Y-Y-You can't get this shit, you ain't making no money
You gon' rob who? You ain't taking nun' from me
Gave that bih' 'bout fifteen-hunnid
She gon' make that shit back for me
New Stingray, I'ma speed race
San Andreas we gon' do his ass like CJ
I got a gun but I ain't gon' use it, that's a dis-play
That's why everytime I see you, you go this way
They say that I'm broke, well I'm bringing out the racks again
They say that I'm a hoe, till I pull up and in all black again
The black Chapo, all this work that I be traffickin'
They took me on a boat, just to go serve some Africans

[Bridge]
My nigga I be fre-re-re-re-fresh, fre-re-re-re-fresh
My nigga I be fre-re-re-re-fresh, fre-re-re-re-fresh
My nigga I be fre-re-re-re-fresh, fre-re-re-re-fresh
My nigga I be fre-re-re-re-fre-re-re-re-fre-re-re-re-fresh
Aye

[Verse 2]
Bank account got area codes, just like a phone number
Get your shot from area codes, call that a long jumper
I got a bay-area hoe, she let me long pump her
She eat the meat, I beat the sheets, and now she in a long coma
She eat the meat, I beat the sheets, and now she in a long coma
She eat the meat, I beat the sheets, and now she in a long coma
She eat the meat, I beat the sheets, and now she in a long coma
