[Intro]
Ha, ha
(Dmac on the fuckin' track)
Ha, ha

[Chorus]
Uh, this is the life, nigga, this Makavelli
Runnin' shit up and go cop me a Chevy
Green, I get that shit like lettuce
Too much money make these niggas get jealous
The life of a convicted felon
These niggas cuttin', they talkin', they tellin' (Word, word, word)
And it's still free all my niggas they jailin' (Word, word, word)
Down the ro-o-oad
Last December, we was sharin' clothes (Clothes, clothes, clothes)
We don't love these bitches, we share hoes (Hoes, hoes)
I just kick shit on the road, with all my bros, trip 'cross the globe
These niggas sellin' they souls, no (No, no)

[Verse]
Man, I can't believe ya, you gon' bite the hand that feed ya, ayy (Woah)
Th-thinkin' 'bout my people, where they when you really need 'em? Ayy (No)
Made my own route and made it out, I took the legal way (Ayy)
These pistols savin' niggas tryna take my fuckin' lead away (Ah)
I do this for my bros and my folks and my Locs (Locs)
I do this for the niggas that be kickin' down doors (I do)
I-I-I do this for the gang (Gang), what I rep, double 0 (Woah)
I don't do this for the name or the fame, it's for my folks (Folks)
Will I change up? That's a no (No)
Sippin' on this lean, movin' slow (Slow, slow)
Shawty head game on a roll (Roll)
Her nigga is a lame and she know

[Chorus]
Uh, this is the life, nigga, this Makavelli
Runnin' shit up and go cop me a Chevy
Green, I get that shit like lettuce
Too much money make these niggas get jealous
The life of a convicted felon
These niggas cuttin', they talkin', they tellin' (Word, word, word)
And it's still free all my niggas they jailin' (Word, word, word)
Down the ro-o-oad
Last December, we was sharin' clothes (Clothes, clothes, clothes)
We don't love these bitches, we share hoes (Hoes, hoes)
I just kick shit on the road, with all my bros, trip 'cross the globe
These niggas sellin' they souls, no (No, no)
