[Intro]
Hey, hey check me out man
I walk in the bank to no complaints
'Cause I know all my cash on my card
I know I ain't gotta swipe that motherfucker
I might serve your seat, you hear me?
Couple labels callin', ha
So you know it ain't no complaints
Word, word, word
Ain't no fuckin' complaints man
Ain't no way I'm geekin' until they accept me
Don't worry 'bout me, hah

Take your raps so that's personal aimin' (that's on my mama)
But don't take it personal, shit can get worser though
Didn't want to hurt you so I had to murk your ho (word)
Shells on his back but no ninja turtle though (turtle)
Killin' these babies like I was on birth control (she dead)
This is the life that I live, this is the life that I chose (I chose, I chose)

These niggas they gon' hate for sure
When you're up next it's time to blow (to blow)
No complaints, I ain't worried 'bout it (worried 'bout it)
