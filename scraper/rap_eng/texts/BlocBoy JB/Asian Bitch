[Intro: BlocBoy JB & Valee]
Hah, hah
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
I got an Asian bitch, she said she want shrimp fried rice (rice)
I got a cougar bitch, when we fuck she give me rides (my rides)
I got a worrisome bitch, she said BlocBoy please be mine (be mine)
And I told her that I love her but I should've never lied (lied)

[Verse 1: BlocBoy JB]
Bitch get by (get by), you swat with no fly (fly)
Pull up with that Glock, late night, do drive-by (rrah)
Layin' in the dirt, it's bright, ayy I'm high (I'm high)
Pie to the throat, ayy baby I'm fly (I'm fly)
I mean business (business)
Catchin' bodies, nigga we don't leave no witness (bodies)
Work a bitch like she up at Planet Fitness (Planet Fitness)
And we gon' toss that bitch like a fuckin' frisbee (like a frisbee)
Hold up, hold up, nah keep that shit like that (like that)
You know our pockets be fat (be fat)
Say the wrong thing, you get snatched (get snatched)
I'm 'bout to bring out them racks (them racks)
Thirty-two up in my pocket, that Shaq (Diesel)
Put you in a hole like a rat (rat)
I just spent a cool ten bands at Saks (at Saks)
Fifths (word), Fifths (huh?), I'm so high now
Say you got some money but you left, guess you lyin' now (you lyin' now)
That nigga is broke, he talkin' reckless, now he flyin' now (he flyin' now)
Family tied now, he must didn't think I was gon' slide down (RIP him)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
I got an Asian bitch, she said she want shrimp fried rice (rice)
I got a cougar bitch, when we fuck she give me rides (my rides)
I got a worrisome bitch, she said BlocBoy please be mine (be mine)
And I told her that I love her but I should've never lied (lied)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
I got a bitch that's Vietnamese and she gon' suck my soul out (oh lord)
She always bitchin' and trippin', got in her feelings and put my clothes out (bitch)
Got a hood ho, she always asking for help (no)
Bad little bitch with her ratchet little self
Talk of the town (what?), thot ho rep
Nigga to nigga, keep dick on her breath
I got a bitch that go to church, say she believe in Christ
I nailed her to the cross, I gave her pipe, called it a night (ugh ugh)
I got a cougar, she in her thirties
Baby gon' take a trial, told me don't worry
I feel like she worth it, I got her some surgery
See how I'm real, ain't no nigga perfect
Got a lil bitch, don't speak no englo, she like hatchi-tatchi (tatchi)
I got the sauce like yum yum so I guess she teriyaki
From the bottom of her knees she gon' top me
If she do it real good she gon' lock me (fed)
I'm gon' put it in her stomach, she gon' stop me (hold on, hold on)
On her grill, she gon' eat it like hibachi, hey

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
I got an Asian bitch, she said she want shrimp fried rice (rice)
I got a cougar bitch, when we fuck she give me rides (my rides)
I got a worrisome bitch, she said BlocBoy please be mine (be mine)
And I told her that I love her but I should've never lied (lied)
