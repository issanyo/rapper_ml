[Intro]
Hah, yeah, ayy

[Chorus]
This my last day out (day out)
I ain't have a job, took the fast way out (way out)
Servin' good dope, come runnin' in and out (gas)
Police at the door, bitch shut your fuckin' mouth (fuckin' mouth)
Shut your fuckin' mouth (fuckin' mouth)
You don't know what a nigga 'bout ('bout)
Been had the dope in a drought (in a drought)
All this dissing for some motherfuckin' clout
Shoot an opposition, turn his ass to a cloud (to a motherfuckin' cloud)
This my last day out
I ain't have a job, took the fast way out (word)
Servin' good dope, come runnin' in and out (yeah)
Police at the door, bitch shut your fuckin' mouth (yeah, yeah)
Shut your fuckin' mouth
You don't know what a nigga 'bout ('bout)
Been had the dope in a drought (in a drought)
All this dissing for some motherfuckin' clout (fuckin' clout)
Shoot an opposition, turn his ass to a cloud (to a cloud)

[Verse]
Hah, you don't know what I been through
Murder on an opp, nigga fuck what we kin to (fuck 'em)
Money stack tall, man it sit about ten two (it's tall)
Fuck on my bitch then I fuck on her friend too (woo)
Ayy bay bay, no Hurricane Chris
You ain't never seen a nigga fresh as hell like this (sauced up)
Chain so yellow it might smell like piss
I don't need no Cartier for the Truey outfit (Truey)
Everybody Gucci, I don't need Louis
Coogi sweater on, got me feelin' like Boosie
Takin' pictures with a groupie, got my hand on her booty
Then I get up in her plan like a motherfuckin' doobie
What is the Bloc? that is the clan
Thirty-three shots, I cannot miss my man
Rest in peace Joc, I miss my man
And for lil T-Rock I run up them bands (bands)

[Chorus]
This my last day out (day out)
I ain't have a job, took the fast way out (way out)
Servin' good dope, come runnin' in and out (gas)
Police at the door, bitch shut your fuckin' mouth (fuckin' mouth)
Shut your fuckin' mouth (fuckin' mouth)
You don't know what a nigga 'bout ('bout)
Been had the dope in a drought (in a drought)
All this dissing for some motherfuckin' clout
Shoot an opposition, turn his ass to a cloud (to a motherfuckin' cloud)
This my last day out
I ain't have a job, took the fast way out (word)
Servin' good dope, come runnin' in and out (yeah)
Police at the door, bitch shut your fuckin' mouth (yeah, yeah)
Shut your fuckin' mouth
You don't know what a nigga 'bout ('bout)
Been had the dope in a drought (in a drought)
All this dissing for some motherfuckin' clout (fuckin' clout)
Shoot an opposition, turn his ass to a cloud (to a cloud)
