[Chorus]
Aye
See you smiling in that new gucci dress
It's your birthday girl I know you a mess
She wanna fuck with me
Get up on top when she making love to me
[?]
Bae it's about loyalty

[Verse 1]
I feel like [?] them toys on me
My bank account look like forgery
I'm in the street like it's sesame
All of my niggas was sellin cheese
(All of my niggas was sellin cheese)
100k that ain't nothing to me
(100k that ain't nothing to me)
I count the C's just to help me sleep
I'm in the hills up in Beverly
Fucking on a bitch named Stephanie
She want the money, cars, clothes
Swear the bitch can't get ahead from me
(can't get ahead from me)
Swear the bitch can't get ahead from me
(Swear the bitch can't get ahead from me)
Swear the bitch can't get ahead from me
[?]
I treat this shit like my destiny
I get the brick like it's celery
VVS diamonds my clarity
So much money I don't care if I tear it
Bugs Bunny I got all of these Karats
If you got my heart then you know you can't share
[?]

[Chorus]
See you smiling in that new gucci dress
It's your birthday girl I know you a mess
She wanna fuck with me
Get up on top when she making love to me
[?]
Bae it's about loyalty
Baby it's about loyalty
Baby it's about loyalty
Bae it's about loyalty
Baby it's about loyalty
See you smiling in that new gucci dress
It's your birthday girl I know you a mess
She wanna fuck with me
Get up on top when she making love to me
[?]
Bae it's about loyalty
