[Chorus]
BlocBoy be the next to blow, I serve you gas like Texaco
We don't smoke no Reginald, you can't beef with a vegetable
Plug live in Mexico, he serve me P's for extra low
AR with the fucking scope, now where the fuck his head just go

[Verse]
First day back up on the block, it's still murder on the opps
Call up Bands, I need a chop, I chop 'em like the barber shop
Serve you like I deal a lot, I love guns, bitch I kill a lot
Money, I keep bills a lot, them choppers make you Milly Rock
San Antonio to shoot you, I call that Ginobili
Niggas snitching on they niggas, tryna keep it lowkey
Riding 'round like we T.I., my nigga we four deep
When you see me in the street, my nigga you don't know me
It's my first day out, it's my first day out
You ain't beefin' 'bout no money then that shit is played out
I got the bald fade now, I can cop all J's now
Man I came a long way from the halfway house
Back on the block, twenty-three Glocks
Watching for cops, I got gas in my sock
The way that I'm flexing, you'd think I'm The Rock
I load up my weapon and aim at your top
Teach a nigga lessons with the Smith & Wesson
I send them bullets at you like a message
I do not love 'em, I work 'em like peasants
I'm at your house like I'm Santa with presents
Laid in a Phantom
I stitch it up like a nut to a hammer
I move that white, call it Hannah Montana
Come in your house with them purple bandanas
Bet you can't handle
Make that boy strip like a dancer
Kidnap your mama for ransom
Your bitch she love me, I'm handsome
Thirties on forty, turn him to a phantom

[Chorus]
BlocBoy be the next to blow, I serve you gas like Texaco
We don't smoke no Reginald, you can't beef with a vegetable
Plug live in Mexico, he serve me P's for extra low
AR with the fucking scope, now where the fuck his head just go
It's Bloc
