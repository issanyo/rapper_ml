[Intro]
Hah, hah
Let's see me call my plug
Shh, be quiet, hah

[Verse 1]
I told that bitch to shut the fuck up (the fuck up), every time I call my plug up (my plug)
Bitch we totin' choppers (word), nigga you can put the snug up (word, word)
These niggas in trouble (huh?)
Beat 'em up, ayy they get roughed up (that's on my mama)
You can call me a barber, I'ma give his ass a touch up (raow, baow)
Sometimes I wanna rob Brink trucks (Brink trucks)
I leave 'em wet, put the sink up (sink up)
I got my stripes like the Bengals (Bengals)
Made seven fifty off singles (singles)
You know that shit there mean bands (bands)
Call up the forty and I hit my man (yeah)
Call up the plug for a plan (yeah)
I get the package from Pakistan (yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
I got me a plug up in Mexico (up in Mexico)
He gon' bring the gas just like Texaco (just like Texaco)
Eighteen for a bow nigga, that's for the low (gas, gas)
Twenty for a show nigga, I need some more (bands, bands)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, hello? I'm insured like a gecko
Smokin' on gas, that petrol (gas)
I'm on the block like a Lego
Eatin' all morning like leggo (leggo)
Call up your bitch like let go (let go)
I leave her wet like a meadow
She good with the ball like Melo (yeah)
I hit her line like hello
She good with the dog like Petco (huh, that's on my mama)

[Chorus]
I got me a plug up in Mexico (up in Mexico)
He gon' bring the gas just like Texaco (just like Texaco)
Eighteen for a bow nigga, that's for the low (gas, gas)
Twenty for a show nigga, I need some more (bands, bands)

[Outro]
Sometimes I wanna rob Brink trucks (Brink trucks)
I leave 'em wet, put the sink up (sink up)
I got my stripes like the Bengals (Bengals)
Made seven fifty off singles (singles)
You know that shit there mean bands (bands)
Call up the forty and I hit my man (yeah)
Call up the plug for a plan (yeah)
I get the package from Pakistan (yeah yeah yeah)
