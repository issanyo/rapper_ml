[Intro: BlocBoy JB]
Bounce, ha, huh, ayy, uh, word
Uh, huh, word, BlocBoy
Bounce make the beat drop

[Refrain: BlocBoy JB &  MaSiWei]
What's that in your hand, boy? Let it go (let it go)
I'll be pumpin' gas like Texaco (Texaco)
You can catch the shot like it's medical (88)
Girl, you got me frozen, lil' ho, I'ma let it go

[Bridge: MaSiWei]
My face is yellow, but my heart is blue
Film me a movie, sent to Hollywood
I do it like Usher, nice and slow
Girl, you got me like Frozen, I'm gon' just let it go

[Verse 1: DZ]
She say do you like me, type 3, I'ma pipe her
撥通911控訴我有多fire
After breakfast, make another one
My girl so hungry, she need 很大的碗
我一聽這首歌我好想打把2K
Higher Brothers就是最精英的部隊
請你不要觸摸我的敏感部位
她說上次拒絕我只是個誤會

[Verse 2: MaSiWei]
You feel it when we made it
I like it, so I take it
You talk about the rules
I don’t get it, I just break it
We don’t talk, we just work
We get pussy, you a jerk
Don’t bring your girlfriend meet me
'Cause you know I’ma flirt

[Bridge: MaSiWei]
My face is yellow, but my heart is blue
Film me a movie sent to Hollywood
I do it like Usher, nice and slow
Girl, you get me like a Frozen, I'm gon' just let it go

[Refrain: BlocBoy JB]
What's that in your hand, boy? Let it go (let it go)
I be pumpin' gas like Texaco (Texaco)
You can catch the shot like it's medical (medical)
Girl, you got me frozen, lil' ho, I'ma let it go

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB & MaSiWei]
Let it go (huh, huh)
Let it go (word, word, 88)
Let it go (let it, let it go)
Let it go (let it go, let it go)
Bounce

[Verse 3: BlocBoy JB]
I'ma let it go like Keyshia Cole (Keyshia Cole)
You know that I ball like Amber Rose (Amber Rose)
Niggas label me like Interscope (word), or Atlantic though
Strip club, we throw plenty though (money)
Ooh, ooh, a hunnid band, got the cash out (cash out)
Lil mama bend it over, got her ass out (ass out)
Call that ho a button 'cause she got me wanna smash now (word, word)
You ain't ridin' with the Nation, nigga, stand down (huh)
Hey lil' mama, let me whisper in your ear (yeah)
I only sip lean, I don't do the beer (word)
All my niggas hard-bodies and y'all niggas look soft (that's on my momma)
Headshot a nigga, just to see his thoughts (bow)
And I ain't gonna do it 'cause you said I can (said I can)
You know I'm gettin' green, I'm a Celtics fan (I'm a Celtics fan)
I'm like oof (huh), what y'all niggas wanna do? (do)
I'ma let it go on your whole fuckin' crew

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Let it go (huh?)
Let it go (word, word)
Let it go (let it, let it go)
Let it go (let it go, let it go)

[Verse 4: Psy. P]
從來不回頭, higher we go
I got the 美酒 on the table
Show you my wealth like Lucifer in hell
You drink your milk, I drink a XL
Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, LV
見過面的女孩他們都想marry me
我有用不完的energy來消滅enemies
一般人沒有資格成為我的family

[Verse 5: Melo]
One night for plug one night for love one night for
One night for fuck, 419 be careful
My money, my money as much as difficulties
Mr. Troublemaker worked out any trouble for me
我曾經stay in the dark and I'm searching for help
到現在他們通宵排隊只為買我的票
I change VIP into VVIP
她會離開你, speaking Chinese and be riding my dick

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Let it go (huh?)
Let it go (word, word)
Let it go (let it, let it go)
Let it go (let it go, let it go)
