[Intro]
Hah
Yeah
Ayy don't jump in that motherfuckin' sea, you can't swim, you heard me?
Naro countin' up plenty money

[Chorus]
Don't jump in that sea if you cannot swim (word)
When it's wintertime stomp 'em in Timbs (word)
Shoot me like Allan, I'm above the rim (huh?)
Like a video, you can get trimmed (that's on my mama)
Armadillo, I'm 'bout to roll
Say it's chilly ho, my watch is froze
AR's with telescopes (yeah)
I aim and let it go (word)
Don't jump in that sea if you cannot swim
When it's wintertime stomp 'em in Timbs
Shoot me like Allan, I'm above the rim (the rim)
Like a video, you can get trimmed (trimmed)
Armadillo, I'm 'bout to roll (to roll)
Say it's chilly ho, my watch is froze (it's froze)
AR's with telescopes (yeah)
I aim and let it go (baow)

[Verse]
What the fuck do you mean?
I think it's time to put ice on my team
I think it's time to cop me some Margielas
Just to let you know the money gettin' better
Fucked on your bitch on the first night I met her
I A-B-C-D her like alphabet letter, shooters on schedule
Strapped like Adidas or Tony the Tiger (word)
Can't come on the block 'cause we got the sniper (doon-doon-doon)
Gotta be a shooter with a Ruger than your Mustang (Mustang)
Hit the top of your medula in the Mustang (Mustang)
Bitch I stand tall like a Great Dane (word)
Ten bands stuffed in the wall, that's a great stain (word word word word)
Hundreds I'm up and they faded like aw naw
Better watch what you say, I shoot all y'all
This shit first forty-eight, not no hog call
Got these gloves on my MAC like I'm Paul Wall

[Chorus]
Don't jump in that sea if you cannot swim (word)
When it's wintertime stomp 'em in Timbs (word)
Shoot me like Allan, I'm above the rim (huh?)
Like a video, you can get trimmed (that's on my mama)
Armadillo, I'm 'bout to roll
Say it's chilly ho, my watch is froze
AR's with telescopes (yeah)
I aim and let it go (word)
Don't jump in that sea if you cannot swim
When it's wintertime stomp 'em in Timbs
Shoot me like Allan, I'm above the rim (the rim)
Like a video, you can get trimmed (trimmed)
Armadillo, I'm 'bout to roll (to roll)
Say it's chilly ho, my watch is froze (it's froze)
AR's with telescopes (yeah)
I aim and let it go (baow)
