[Intro: BlocBoy JB]
Hah, ayy
Man I'm finna get full of the gas
Puff puff pass
Probably go to the lil party or somethin', lil bitch some'

Whole lot of Bloc and shit, no oppin' shit
Shootin' shit like Peja, StojakoviÄ‡
For real, hah, hah, word

[Chorus: BlocGirl Nae Staccs & BlocBoy JB]
Turnt on the block, it's a G party (G party)
I'm on my JB shit, caught two bodies (two bodies)
I charged your ho, what you gon' do about it? (do about it)
Would've cuffed the bitch, but she too thotty (too thotty)
Freak lil ho, she too naughty (too naughty)
Stay fresh as fuck, I'm too cocky (yeah, yeah)
You gang bang but don't know your knowledge (word)
Sauce drippin' on me like a runnin' faucet (word word word word)

[Post-Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, somebody got me started (me started)
Madonna in the club, it's a C party (crip)
Everybody eats, that's regardless (yeah)
Cock the strap back, I can't de-cock it (rrah)
Break the bitch head in the bed, it was too sloppy (too sloppy)
Hit her from the back, she like ooh papi (ooh papi)
Freaky lil bitch acting too cocky (too cocky)
I'm a bad boy like I knew Rocky (yeah)

[Chorus: BlocGirl Nae Staccs]
Turnt on the block, it's a G party (G party)
I'm on my JB shit, caught two bodies (two bodies)
I charged your ho, what you gon' do about it? (nothin')
Would've cuffed the bitch, but she too thotty (nah)
Freak lil ho, she too naughty (nothin')
Stay fresh as fuck, I'm too cocky (First 48)
You gang bang but don't know your knowledge (don't know your knowledge)
Sauce drippin' on me like a runnin' faucet (yeah)

[Verse 1: BlocGirl Nae Staccs]
Red, white, and blue, I'm G blockin'
Being down and broke is not an option
We hittin' licks, we spent the profit
Doctor said JB had high problems
Fuck what they say, he'll hop out it
Hopped out the car, he chopped around me
Never lackin', I'm shootin' like Vince Carter
Can't dodge them bullets when they get to sparkin'
Yellow black tape, nigga on the cop shit
Murder scene with seven dead bodies
Don't witness to tell the feds 'bout it
You a broke ass nigga, you stay flodgin'
Money so tall, can't see the bottom
She stay on her knees like she pickin' cotton
Money so tall, can't see the bottom
Money so tall, can't see the bottom
She stay on her knees like she pickin' cotton

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
Burnt a lil freaky bitch head (she slurpin')
Made her forget what she said (huh?)
I just shot an opp right in his head
His dumb ass was loafin' like bread (he loafin')
Nigga take shots in the leg (baow)
I take a shot in this party (rrah)
I remember days hittin' the club
Fresh with the newest Ed Hardy
Now it's Gucci Louis scarfies
Oops I meant scarves
Trappin' in the dark, servin' in the park, smokin' in the car
Bitches ain't louder than what's in my 'gar
So imagine what's in the back of the car
Guns, and I got funds, so I ain't really worried 'bout bond
Niggas' bitches actin' like niggas, call 'em Mulan
Make 'em feel your ass like a house futon in the living room

[Chorus: BlocGirl Nae Staccs & BlocBoy JB]
Turnt on the block, it's a G party (G party)
I'm on my JB shit, caught two bodies (two bodies)
I charged your ho, what you gon' do about it? (do about it)
Would've cuffed the bitch, but she too thotty (too thotty)
Freak lil ho, she too naughty (too naughty)
Stay fresh as fuck, I'm too cocky (yeah, yeah)
You gang bang but don't know your knowledge (word)
Sauce drippin' on me like a runnin' faucet (word word word word)

[Post-Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy, somebody got me started (me started)
Madonna in the club, it's a C party (crip)
Everybody eats, that's regardless (yeah)
Cock the strap back, I can't de-cock it (rrah)
Break the bitch head in the bed, it was too sloppy (too sloppy)
Hit her from the back, she like ooh papi (ooh papi)
Freaky lil bitch acting too cocky (too cocky)
I'm a bad boy like I knew Rocky (yeah)
