[Verse 1: joji]
(Hey-ya)
As fresh as the breeze and the dew in the morning (Hey-ya)
Never felt a drought where you fill my cup (Hey-ya)
You blessed me so damn good, I barely could stay up (Hey-ya a-ah)
Never felt a drought where you fill my cup

[Chorus: joji & Blocboy JB]
Take you on a picnic then for a ride
Ride it all, ride it alright
Hold the door open, baby, let me come inside
Spoon full of love in your peach jam
My favorite pick me up, no plans
I'd rather stay in with you, hot damn
So tasty on my tongue, peach jam (yeah, huh)
I'm the only one you spread em' for
Only one you spread em' for (only one, they said)

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
You my baby like fetus (like fetus)
Got her on her knees like she prayin' to Jesus
Niggas call us when they need us (when they need us)
I've been trappin' all week, got two or three beepers (brr, brr)
And my shooters on go (on go)
Say you a hitter, my nigga that's a "no no" (that's a no no)
Got your bitch in the bando (in the bando)
She heard you comin' in, and she ran out the back door (word)
Can we just chill for a while? (while)
I'ma tell you how you make me feel when you smile (when you smile)
I could show you how a nigga live in the wild (huh)
Now I got you wet like the Nile, River (River)
I'm a sauce dripper (dripper)
East side Crippin' with my dogs like Clifford (Clifford)
Got me openin' my heart like a blizzard (blizzard)
Lookin' at my calls, that's your bitch, I done hit her (huh)
So you better not kiss her (that's on my momma)

[Chorus: joji]
Take you on a picnic then for a ride, ride it all, ride it alright
Hold the door open, baby, let me come inside
Spoon full of love in your peach jam
My favorite pick me up, no plans
I'd rather stay in with you, hot damn
Still tasty on my tongue, peach jam
I'm the only one you spread em' for
Only one you spread em' for

(instrumental break)

[Chorus: joji & BlocBoy JB]
Peach jam
My favorite pick me up, no plans (yuh)
I'd rather stay in with you, hot damn
Still taste it on my tongue, peach jam (yeah, uh)
I'm the only one you spread em' for
Only one you spread em' for
