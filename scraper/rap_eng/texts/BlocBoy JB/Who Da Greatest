[Intro]
Ayy
Hah
Crip, yeah, crip
You know the crip shit off top nigga (crip, crip, crip)
Yeah, word, word, word

[Chorus]
Who the greatest, he the greatest (crip)
Can't stop, won't stop, we'll never see stop
Blood bitch with me and I think she brang treetops
Four fifty-eight, pull up like a pitstop
Heard you got a safe, tell me where the stash spot
Open up the safe, twelve K, that's a jackpot
Same outfit two days, that's a rerock
Bitches cheerin' for me, you would think I was a mascot

[Verse]
I got the ball and changed the game
Like I'm Chris Paul, I drive the lane (swish)
I move that work like a crane
The shit with the lick, that's a doodoo stain
Check out that young nigga James (word)
Oh my God, that's some Fubu's man
Pull on your block with them rulers man (rrah)
Extendos, extendos on everything (doon-doon-doon)
You play with me, you'll be a dead man
No hoopin' but we on your head man (that's on my mama)
Licks, we got them mollies and bricks
Fuck a bitch and give her head like a pick
Or durag, got a nigga too mad
If he run up on me, open up a can of whoop-ass
Get to steppin', go and get your gun
Them Giuseppes, where'd you get 'em from?
Had a bitch, did somethin' dumb
Fucked a bitch the day after prom
Bitch you know I am the don
Shot them niggas like the sun
Pull like triggers, I'm gun
Fuck that lil ho so she can make my bond

[Chorus]
Who the greatest, he the greatest (crip)
Can't stop, won't stop, we'll never see stop
Blood bitch with me and I think she brang treetops
Four fifty-eight, pull up like a pitstop
Heard you got a safe, tell me where the stash spot
Open up the safe, twelve K, that's a jackpot
Same outfit two days, that's a rerock
Bitches cheerin' for me, you would think I was a mascot (yeah)
