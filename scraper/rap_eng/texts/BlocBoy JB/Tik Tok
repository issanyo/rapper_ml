[Intro: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Young nigga, you know what I'm seein'
I see you Danny, HoodWolf shit
Pablo nigga, Hoodrich nigga
You know what goin' on nigga

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Yeah, ridin' in the foreign like a high speed chase
Loaded with drugs, got a Glock and a K
Gorilla with ice, I'm a Bathing Ape
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, better get out my way
I was trappin' in the hood but I beat the case
Gettin' high on them percs, and I pour up an eight
I wanna have it and eat my cake
A lot of bad habits, get high everyday

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, she go 'round and she a thot
Tick-tock, tick-tock, big rocks in my brand-new watch
Tick-tock, tick-tock, fuck her then I put her out
Tick-tock, tick-tock, twenty-four hours we staying down
I got the racks on me right now, bustin' out
You ain't talkin' 'bout money then shut your mouth
Got a Glock and the block on the paper route
I'm on a day date, no time to take you out
Boogers, ice, lean like snot
My white tee lean, and I rock with the pot
Bad bitches only, don't fuck with no thots
No time for beef, we gon' shoot on the spot

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Cookies in the oven, dope in the crockpot
At the crack, trap spot beating like a boombox
Brown and the white like a moon pie
My young nigga hang in the hood like the Boondocks
What make you think you a goon now?
Boy you geeked up, sit your ass down
Pull up, my whip zero miles
Got rich, I made mama proud
Skinny jeans tight, they Amiri
Diamond Cartier, I see clearly
Drippin' on 'em like I'm teary
Two carats in my earrings
See the diamonds through the tint when I'm steering
Juan, I fuck then I'm disappearing
Your name should be Clarence, you shoppin' the clearance
HÃ©rmes chain, Liberia
My outfit a dime, ten thousand appearance

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, she go 'round and she a thot
Tick-tock, tick-tock, big rocks in my brand-new watch
Tick-tock, tick-tock, fuck her then I put her out
Tick-tock, tick-tock, twenty-four hours we staying down
I got the racks on me right now, bustin' out
You ain't talkin' 'bout money then shut your mouth
Got a Glock and the block on the paper route
I'm on a day date, no time to take you out
Boogers, ice, lean like snot
My white tee lean, and I rock with the pot
Bad bitches only, don't fuck with no thots
No time for beef, we gon' shoot on the spot

[Verse 3: BlocBoy JB]
Tick-tock, you gon' feel defeat just like some flip-flops
2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., ayy this new hip hop
Big Glock, twelve gauge, it's gon' pump you like a pitstop
You say you a dog, you must think that you a pit, stop (stop it)
Hell nah, got your bitch up on my dick dog (she jockin')
Jail call to my niggas, I won't switch dog
Pissed off, can't leave the house without that pistol
Diamonds yellow on my watch 'cause they pissed on

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, she go 'round and she a thot
Tick-tock, tick-tock, big rocks in my brand-new watch
Tick-tock, tick-tock, fuck her then I put her out
Tick-tock, tick-tock, twenty-four hours we staying down
I got the racks on me right now, bustin' out
You ain't talkin' 'bout money then shut your mouth
Got a Glock and the block on the paper route
I'm on a day date, no time to take you out
Boogers, ice, lean like snot
My white tee lean, and I rock with the pot
Bad bitches only, don't fuck with no thots
No time for beef, we gon' shoot on the spot
