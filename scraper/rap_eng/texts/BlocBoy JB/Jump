[Chorus]
Jump, jump (word)
Chopper make a nigga jump (jump)
Jump, jump (jump)
No one on ones, get jumped (get jumped)
Two two threes in the trunk (the trunk)
Them niggas too weak, had to jump (they jump)
Look how I flex and I stunt (word)
I get what you make in a year in a month (word word word word)
Jump, jump (yeah)
Chopper make a nigga jump (jump)
Jump, jump (rrah)
No one on ones, get jumped (get jumped)
Two two threes in the trunk (rrah)
Them niggas too weak, had to jump (jump)
Look how I flex and I stunt (word)
I get what you make in a year in a month (a month)

[Verse]
Check out the gold and the ice on my bezel (my bezel)
I'ma turn flex to a whole 'nother level (a level)
That bitch she diggin', I gave her a shovel (flex)
She say that she love it but my dick is better (it's better)
She give me head, man I swear she is clever (is clever)
I get that paper like I was a mailer (like I was a mailer ho, yeah yeah)
Sauce like meatball marinara (I'm sauced)
If a nigga ever play with the feather (word)
It gon' be blood on some Margielas (Margielas)
Too many hot spots, I want a teller (to tell 'em)
Pull up in drop top, golden Camaro (Camaro)
I stay on point like a bow and arrow (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
You niggas is weak, you niggas is narrow (word)
You ridin' the seat then you is a teller (huh?)
Pull up with thirties or better (that whoa)
Make it rain, bring an umbrella (yeah)
Can't wife a ho, no Cinderella (woo)
I'd rather send her to the fellas (huh?)
Or put her on the strip and sell her (that's on my mama)

[Chorus]
Jump, jump (word)
Chopper make a nigga jump (jump)
Jump, jump (jump)
No one on ones, get jumped (get jumped)
Two two threes in the trunk (the trunk)
Them niggas too weak, had to jump (they jump)
Look how I flex and I stunt (word)
I get what you make in a year in a month (word word word word)
Jump, jump (yeah)
Chopper make a nigga jump (jump)
Jump, jump (rrah)
No one on ones, get jumped (get jumped)
Two two threes in the trunk (rrah)
Them niggas too weak, had to jump (jump)
Look how I flex and I stunt (word)
I get what you make in a year in a month (a month)
