[Intro: BlocBoy JB]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up
Hah, hah, hah

[Verse 1: BlocBoy JB]
Ayy we gon' pull up with them sticks and make 'em lay down (and make 'em lay down)
I got a Glock, it got a dick, and I'ma spray now (graow baow)
That nigga talkin' like a bitch, ayy what you say now? (word, word)
And I just put fifty up in a lil K round (K round)
Gun to your mouth, tell me what you gon' say now bitch (say now)
Ooh, I just spent fifty on jewels (ooh)
Ooh, you know I ball like Caillou (Caillou)
Poof, put a nigga ass on the news (news)
Shoot, then I make a song called Shoot (shoot)
Ice on my wrist and it cost 'bout a coupe (word)
I fuck your bitch and I drop her like oops (that's on my mama)
Oops, I just dropped her like oops (oops)
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh (let's do it)
These niggas, I call 'em Twitter the Tiger (tiger)
You are not a hitter you a typewriter (you a typewriter)
I'ma spark a nigga like a bic lighter (bic lighter)
Smash on your bitch, that's a one-nighter (one-nighter)
I'd rather get jumped before I start running (running)
Hit the dash cuz, don't you see the cops comin'? (they comin')
We gone (gone), I was on the block late night servin' cones (cones)
Y'all was in house when the streetlight came on (that's on my mama)
You know my TY with the chrome (word)
He on the t-rike, he got roam (yeah, yeah)
Hundred fuckin' shots at his dome (yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Oops, I just dropped her like oops
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Oops, I just dropped her like oops
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh

[Verse 2: YG]

You flex on the 'Gram, how?
You don't trap, you ain't flip fifty pounds, wow (uh-oh)
Deuce deuce twenty-five, thirty-eight, forty Glock, four-five
My gun game got style, uh
Niggas know I'm down to slide, double homicide
Do a nigga foul (400)
Keep the Glock cocked, I'm first to start bustin'
You swear you a shooter, I swear I saw you runnin'
You TD ain't turnt down, niggas can't tell me nothin'
You ain't lit bitch, shut up and start fuckin'
Ooh, I had to ice out the crew, ooh
I had to fuck with the blue, ooh

What's the color of the car? suuwoop
Red and blue come together, that's a zoo, ooh
Go against the gang, that's a lose, ooh
Man y'all lil niggas got somethin' to prove, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, bitch I got the juice
Ooh, ooh, ooh, bitch I had a shootout, bitch, it made the news
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah that right there it put me in the mood
Ooh, ooh, ooh, don't get shot bitch, touchin' my jewels

[Chorus: BlocBoy JB]
Oops, I just dropped her like oops
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
Oops, I just dropped her like oops
Baby let's do it like Nike Swoosh
