[Intro]
Hah, hah
Word, word word
Yeah
They ask me all these questions, you know I ain't answer shit, bitch
Check this out man
One thing 'bout me, you heard me
Hah

[Verse 1]
One thing 'bout me, I been 'bout a dollar bill
Put some money on your head, yeah the dollar kill
Shot a nigga 'till he dead, I got hundred skill
Love the blue hundreds, them my fuckin' favorite dollar bill
Nigga played yesterday, almost got killed
Cuz told me don't do it
He standin' there stupid, loc think 'bout your music
Your organization, the shit that you doin'
So I thought to myself, my flag stay to the left
Trojan, bitch I'm strapped to the death
Logan, purple red gang in myself
If you dissin' you rather off hangin' yourself
These niggas not authentic (no)
I came from the water with sharks in it (word)
Bitch I'm on point like a dart with it (yeah)
My car full of gas like a fart in it, for real (that's on my mama)
These niggas are nobodies
Back to teh basics, faded up like Yo Gotti
Say you killer, caught no bodies
Nigga talk around me, hit three out of four targets
Get smoked like Bob Marley
Headshot a nigga 'til he dead and his heart stoppin'
Yeah the feds found four bodies
Cracker ass bitch, like I said I don't know 'bout it (that's on my mama)

[Chorus]
Where was you at on the twenty-second?
Nah, can't answer no questions (no questions)
Have you ever seen this Smith & Wesson?
Nah, do you want to sell it? (how much?)
I was locked up in my celly (word)
Murder for hire, no snitchin' or tellin' (word)
I got no calls or no type of mailin' (word)
Tell me where you was at when I was jailing (word word word word)
Where was you at on the twenty-second? (huh?)
Nah, can't answer no questions (can't answer)
Have you ever seen this Smith & Wesson?
Nah, do you want to sell it? (I want it)
I was locked up in my celly (woo)
Murder for hire, no snitchin' or tellin' (woo)
I got no calls or no type of mailin' (word)
Tell me where you was at when I was jailing (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Listen up boys, I'ma tell you how to do it
Smack a fuck nigga if he ever acting foolish
Fuckin' on your bitch, probably shoot a fuckin' movie
The way she kill [?] you would think she was Jewish
Shouts out to my fuckin' jeweler
Got me iced out, ain't nobody cooler
Send my homeboys just to do you
Y'all fuck around like the turtles in the sewer
Bitch I'm the shit like cow manure
I'm shootin' shit like Rodney Brewer
You talkin' shit, I'm runnin' to you
I call a hit, let the Fonz do you
Fuck on a bitch just to ice out my wrist
AOB, yeah it's all off a bitch
Pass her to cuz, I call that assist
Shoot a nigga 'til he swish

[Chorus]
Where was you at on the twenty-second?

Tell me where you was at when I was jailing (word word word word)
Where was you at on the twenty-second? (huh?)
