[Intro]
DMac on the fuckin' track
It's Holiday season, bitch!

[Chorus: Dave East & BlocBoy JB]
I fucked your bitch on the island
I'm in a new whip with no mileage
This Gucci did not hit the aisle yet
I came up right out the projects
Me and BlocBoy blowin' loud shit
The hate is just part of the process
I throw that shit on, I'ma die fresh
I just spent 90K on some diamonds
90K up on some diamonds
You know my nigga be shinin'
Bezel the watch, perfect timin'
No slow dance, but a nigga grindin'
Niggas talkin' wrong man, what are you findin'
You could go both hands, I'll leave 'em spineless
I fucked your bitch on a island, all of my niggas be wildin'

[Verse 1: Dave East & BlocBoy JB]
Sick in the head, when I shoot it, I'm smilin'
Can't believe I made it out public housing
I used to wake up and break down them ounces
I just did a walk-through, I wake up and count it
I call my loc 'bout these bitches in Memphis
Elliot got me these necklaces, it's tinted
I just bought a Maybach, and no, it's not rented
Keep comin' with back-ends, you know I'ma spend it
We get the back-ends
We gon' hit your bitch from the back end
And it's no lackin'
Curry came in through the back end
We get them packs in
We serve that shit make it look like some back-ends
These niggas actin', they ain't got they facts in
I'm 'bout to break 'em down just like a fraction
I took your bitch and I fucked on a island
Get fresh on my own, I do not got a stylist
I'm fly as fuck like a mo'fuckin' pilot
I step back and shoot 'cause these niggas be foulin'
My youngin' gon' shoot, he in love with the violence
I just popped a pill and it fucked up my balance
I lay 'em down like I just did a tile in
I throw 'em down like intentional groundin'

[Chorus: Dave East & BlocBoy JB]
I fucked your bitch on the island
I'm in a new whip with no mileage
This Gucci did not hit the aisle yet
I came up right out them projects
Me and BlocBoy blowin' loud shit
The hate is just part of the process
I throw that shit on, I'ma die fresh
I just spent 90K on some diamonds
90K up on some diamonds
You know my nigga be shinin'
Bezel the watch, perfect timin'
No slow dance, but a nigga grindin'
Niggas talkin' wrong man, what are you findin'
You could go both hands, I'll leave 'em spineless
I fucked your bitch on a island, all of my niggas be wildin'

[Verse 2: Dave East & BlocBoy JB]
I took your bitch and I fucked on a island
Get fresh on my own, I do not got a stylist
I'm fly as fuck like a mo'fuckin' pilot
I step back and shoot 'cause these niggas be foulin'
My youngin' gon' shoot, he in love with the violence
I just popped a pill and it fucked up my balance
I lay 'em down like I just did a tile in
I throw 'em down like a intentional groundin'
