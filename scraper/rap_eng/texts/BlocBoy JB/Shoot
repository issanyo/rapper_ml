[Intro]
Bet twenty more, I hit the first roll
Freaky bitch on go, she gone off the road
Run up in your house like I’m commando
Clip hanging out the Glock, extendo

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

[Verse 1]
Strapped like it’s Belly, you singing, R. Kelly
You play it get deadly, it's Grape Gang, no jelly
I'm counting up fetti, you talking already
I pull up with choppers that come with machetes
I’m fucking on Betty, her head got me steady
I call her Lil Caesars, that bitch hot and ready
My gun a Lil Caesars, that bitch hot and ready
I dumped my lil bitch, now that bitch hot and jealous
Hold up, let me catch my breath
Shoot a nigga 'til he dead say he killed himself
Fill 'em up with holes like a criminal
Paralyzed waist down, now he can’t feel himself
Ride with my guys man, I swear it ain’t nothing else
Freaky bitch, I make her touch herself
I’m balling in town, look like fuck a ref
Leave his ass stanking, I blow him like bad breath
Woah, double-oh-seven, hit him with the weapon, gotta
Go, when the police come, dip underground
Spend a hundred somethin' when I move around
Lil bitty boy, you still eat off the ground
You see them Haitians, they up on the Gram
Shh, don’t make a sound

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot

[Post-Chorus]
Bet twenty more, I hit the first roll
Freaky bitch on go, she gone off the road
Run up in your house like I’m commando
Clip hanging out the Glock, extendo

[Verse 2]
Homicide, bitch we known for that
Screenshotting shit, I text her, you too grown for that
Yeah that trap shit, I got two phones for that
I’m a dog, I think that I got a bone to fetch
Stop what you're doing
Thirty-three in my clip, that’s Patrick Ewing
Open up wide, girl I’m looking for the chewing
Shawty gave me head, now I know what she pursuing
It's the nina with the coolant
Mask on, AR, bitch that’s on my side
PRG, 700, we don’t let shit slide (crip)
We don’t let shit slide (crip), nigga play with me I ride (crip)
Bitch I’m cripping with the guys, We get up with three high fives

[Chorus]
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
