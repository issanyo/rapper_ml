[Intro]
Fuck goin' on?
Hey, yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Hah, hah, woo, hold up, hold up, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hold up, huh, huh, word, word, word word word word

[Verse]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss
Got your bitch, she on her knees, she gon' eat the dick
Smoking strong, that Hercules, you can't tell me shit
Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out
Started by pulling them tracks out
This shit is facts now, you can get whacked now
Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller

[Outro]
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
East side, east side, east side nigga that's C side
Who up on my side nigga, you know I'ma ride
If you play with my side, bitch it's homicide
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)
