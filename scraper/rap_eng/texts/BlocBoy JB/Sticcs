[Intro]
I'm ready, hah
Sticks out, sticks out bitch
Know what I'm sayin', man down
That nigga dead, he didn't stand a chance
I don't want none of y'all niggas to move man
At all, at all, hah-hachoo
I want that nigga right there to lay down, yeah you
And I want that bitch right there, yeah you
Go get all the motherfuckin' money
All the motherfuckin' money man
Stand down, we got them sticks

[Chorus]
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (yeah)
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)

[Verse]
If you move the wrong way you get shot in the face
Have you runnin' like a marathon race
Bitch, wipe all that snot off your face
You wasn't from the gang, now the Glock in your face
I get the dough like I'm Homer
I heat the gas up, now 12 the aroma
Them niggas stepped on me, now they got coma
Now I'ma give it to 'em like a donut
Kill you if I want to, huh
You know my persona
Saw your bitch and caught a boner (I'm hard)
You know BlocBoy bunkin' (on God)
Front you like a loner, don't pay me then I'ma own you (word)
Hitters pull up on you, they smoke you like marijuana (Bloc)

[Chorus]
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (yeah)
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (yeah)
We got them sticks bitch (yeah), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)
We got them sticks bitch (word), we got them sticks bitch (word)
