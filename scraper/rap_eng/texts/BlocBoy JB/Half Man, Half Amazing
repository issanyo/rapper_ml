[Verse]
Thirty on the scale, weigh it up and then go sell
You know I keep that shell like I work at Taco Bell
Get my pack straight through the mail, got a cane on me no player
Heard a nigga dissed the block, load the Glock, let's give him hell
If a nigga lookin' strange to us, we smoke him like angel dust
No uniform but that forty tucked, you say the wrong thing, I bust
You better listen, this is not fiction
Keep me a thirty extension, clip hangin' out like a lynching
Somebody just called, they ex missing
I hit her ass up, [?]
One ear open, I hear everything
I heard them niggas sneak dissin', tryna get some fame
I think them niggas want some clout, or a name
I'ma pull up at they house and let that forty bang
All my niggas real hitters, they don't miss a thing, or a mane
Flag hang to the left but all my niggas every gang (that's on my mama)
Heard them niggas wanna kill me
I'd rather catch a case or fucking plead guilty
Niggas want me six feet but I'm six feet with a .50
Cougars, I love them cougars, my bitch filthy
Rugers, I bust them Rugers, then start dipping
Weapons, we aimin' steady, we not missing
Sevens, you see them sevens, bitch we cripping
Liver, these niggas Chicken Little, 'cause they snitching
Bitches, they be bitching, come together like a stitching
One day I will be up on the big screen (that's on my mama)
Hah, like I said
I'm a crip but my infra bang red
Your team ain't ate but them niggas still fed
You know I'm big grape, should get it tatted on my head
(Yeah yeah yeah)
Hah, like I said
I'm a crip but my infra bang red
Your team ain't ate but them niggas still fed
You know I'm big grape, should get it tatted on my head
(Word word word word)
