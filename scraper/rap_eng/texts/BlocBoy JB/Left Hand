[Verse]
Up with the Glock and a nigga turn to tot
Look at the Rollie, no tick tock
These niggas funny like Chris Rock
You face defeat like flip-flops
I'm in the hood with a whole bunch of animals
These niggas kids, give 'em Trix and some Danimals
Bullets, they eat 'em, my clip full of cannibals (word)
Put you in the ground like I thought you were plantable (that's on my mama)

[Chorus]
No, bet you can't steal my flow
No, nigga must think I'm a ho
No, you ain't got them shooters on go
No, choppa make his head sprint
No, nigga you a has been
I don't want a rabbit no more, I want your best friend
Speakin' of my best friend
I don't have a best friend, bitch I got a left hand

[Bridge]
Crip, crip
Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, yeah

Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Left hand, left hand

East side Grape Street, Grape Street, Grape Street, left hand
Yeah, ho
Yeah, ho
That's on my mama

[Chorus]
No, bet you can't steal my flow
No, nigga must think I'm a ho
No, you ain't got them shooters on go
No, choppa make his head sprint
No, nigga you a has been
I don't want a rabbit no more, I want your best friend
Speakin' of my best friend
I don't have a best friend, bitch I got a left hand
