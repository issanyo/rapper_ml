[Intro]
Came a long motherfuckin' way from Fila
I remember rockin' two socks with the Reeboks
Now a nigga got the J's with the G-Shocks
P-90 Ruger, four-five with the D cock
My mic shoot two niggas in this motherfucker man
I'm livin' too turnt man, I'm too motherfuckin' turnt man
These niggas don't know what's goin' on man
D Block or none' nigga, go get your gun man
Go get two of 'em, hah

[Chorus]
I got two pots, I got two stoves
I got two hoes, I got two bros
I faced two grams, now I'm too gone
I ain't talkin' Kevin Gates but I got two phones
Two, two (turn up), two, two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two (turn up), two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two, two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two (turn up), two (turn up), two

[Verse]
I got two Glocks, feel like 2Pac
I fuck your main bitch, name too hot
Give her double dick, I got two cocks
I remember days when I ain't have a shoebox
Came a long motherfuckin' way from Fila
I remember rockin' two socks with the Reeboks
Now a nigga got the J's with the G-Shocks
P-90 Ruger, four-five with the D cock
Only thing these bitches get from me is deep cock
I was down, looked to the ground and couldn't see rocks
Police really don't want me to come and see pops
Asking God why he took my homie C-Raw (rest in peace)
Shoot, shoot, what they wanna do
I don't give a fuck, take it how you want to
I'm the shit, baby girl check out my jeans True
And if you try me on that fuck shit I'ma let it loose

[Chorus]
I got two pots, I got two stoves
I got two hoes, I got two bros
I faced two grams, now I'm too gone
I ain't talkin' Kevin Gates but I got two phones
Two, two (turn up), two, two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two (turn up), two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two, two (turn up)
Two, two (turn up), two (turn up), two (turn up), two
