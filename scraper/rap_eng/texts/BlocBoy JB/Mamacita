Hah, hah, girl you know I'm a gentleman, hah, hah

Yeah, I'ma hold the door for you and all that girl, you know
Open the door for you, open the car, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
Say, that's your ho, that's my mamacita (word)
I'm about to stick it in her like a new needle (a needle)
Then ride off in the two-seater (two-seater)
Squad full of animals, zookeeper (zookeeper)
I'm about to stomp her, no beetle (no beetle)
Post in the kitchen, them pots and the beakers (word)
Looking for a nigga's senorita (huh?)
Got her on her knees like she praying to a Jesus (she slurpin')

[Verse]
Baby lose your man, he jealous (he jealous)
I just wanna wop like Fetty (like Fetty)
You know I bang Grape, no jelly (crip)
What you need? I got it, I sell it (what you need?)
Fuck the bitch the first day I met her (I met her)
Rock and roll like heavy metal (heavy metal)
Kinda weird 'cause I let my dog pet her (he pet her)
Rock J's, no Maison Margiela (no 'gielas)
Move pounds, y'all niggas move feathers (move feathers)
Gun you down because my niggas shoot better (do better)
Who better? My nigga, I'm too better (huh?)

Hotspot, tether (tether), extendos on Berettas (Beretta)
You dance with the devil (the devil), I dance with Cinderellas (ooh)
My bitch bad, she got a nice ass (nice ass)
And she got some class (class), I might buy her a bag (a bag)
Your bitch, whoa (whoa), that ho need to roll (to roll)
I'm a gentleman (huh?), you know I had to hold the door (that's on my mama)

[Chorus]
Say, that's your ho, that's my mamacita (word)
I'm about to stick it in her like a new needle (a needle)
Then ride off in the two-seater (two-seater)
Squad full of animals, zookeeper (zookeeper)
I'm about to stomp her, no beetle (no beetle)
Post in the kitchen, them pots and the beakers (word)
Looking for a nigga's senorita (huh?)
Got her on her knees like she praying to a Jesus (she slurpin')
