[Intro]
Plug just came with the pack so fat that a nigga might gon' and hit 'em with the ugh
Nigga diss the block, wait a minute
Forty with the lemon, hit your body, make a nigga do the fool
This kush right here in a minute
OG gas, make a nigga cough off first pull
My clip got a lil too mini
One up in the head, I don't give a fuck if the bitch full
Tay Keith produced it
Not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, six

[Verse]
C'mon, I'ma keep goin' like a run-on
Pussy ass nigga diss the block so he got his ass run on
Now he like hold on
Grabbin' on his eye, reachin' for someone to hold on
I don't think he smell me so I shot him in the nose bone
Got the bitch naked so I told her put her clothes on
BlocBoy south beach, lookin' like a walkin' sno-cone
No Big Tymer but I told her get your roll on (crip)
Touch his ass up like an iPhone
Fetty Wap him, now his eye gon'
Head knock him, taste like Betty Crocker
I'ma give you an F like I'm Denzel Crocker
I got that word like a fuckin' lager
Keep that strap and your bitch right by my boxers
If you ain't talkin' money then don't bother
Like Shnitzel, all I hear is Rada Rada
All this money, can't give a bitch a penny
I would never change, you can keep them pennies
Smack a broke nigga, what you thought was with them pennies
How many knifes you got? many many many
Clip hangin' out, it's extended-stended-stended
Walk around like a motherfuckin' zombie
Big ass motherfuckin' chopper on me
Posted in the jungle rockin' down dundee
You can say things got wild quickly
When he came at me talkin' too foul quickly
I gave him this shot, I ain't talkin' whiskey
Now he fallin' on the ground like he was tipsy
Hustle hustle hustle, man I feel like Nipsey
I'ma pull a drive by on a ten speed
Three live, smokin' three five with your bitch
And you know she three high, finna get fucked by three guys
Hold on, I ain't finna stop
Ain't nobody cleanin' but we comin' with the mops
Treat you like [?], bro we bustin' at his top (doon-doon-doon)
You can jumped like a motherfuckin' hop (doon-doon-doon)
Bitch tried to set me up, got her ass shot
Savin' these hoes, nigga you a Robocop
Police in the store, servin' in the parking lot
And my gun in your face, would you give me what you got?
Pull up on an opp like pow
It's a man down, somebody done shot up the crowd
Nigga say he smokin' on loud, but that shit mild
I can't hear the shit right now (that's on my mama)
I got your main boo wasted, my dick she can taste it
It's in the bitch mouth like some braces (she suck me)
If I spray, my whole crew sprayin'
What is you sayin'? have you flyin' with the birds, toucan
Beam me like I had a laser (laser)
Rarely eat, just had the blazers (I'm fresh as a motherfucker)
Put a hole in you, no bagel
Bitch I been ballin' on 'em like the Pacers (swish)
My chain and my ear they is glistening (word)
Like damn, look at my wrist again (damn)
My chain need a Pamper, it's pissin' (woo)
I cannot go like this
I will not show my glizzy, I take it on the road every city (word)
I just threw fifty bows to the city
And called up lil Mishio to come get it (that is my nigga)
No OKC but I'm posted with thunder
Pay, Feezy, and Doolie, my young fuckin' gunners
They shot a nigga through a goal like a punter
I fuck her and don't let her smoke on my ganja (can't hit this blunt)
Plug just came with the pack so fat that a nigga might gon' and hit 'em with the ugh
Nigga diss the block, wait a minute
Forty with the lemon, hit your body, make a nigga do the fool
This kush right here in a minute
OG gas, make a nigga cough off first pull
My clip got a lil too mini
One up in the head, I don't give a fuck if the bitch full
Niggas think they killer, is it 'cause the weed and liquor? (I think so)
Fuck your bitch and squeeze her nipples (bankroll)
She suck my dick until it tickles (word)
Gas blunt, I'm facin' it (gas, gas)
Never put my face in it (never)
Your main bitch is takin' dick (woo)
I told her put her waist in it
High as a motherfuckin' fool (fool)
Slice your ass up like a pool (word)
I could've bought five pair of Robins but really said fuck this shit, copped me some Trues (Trues)
Jordan logo on my shoes (J'ed up)
All my dogs Scooby Doo (dogs)
No U-Haul, we on the moon
My nigga Lil Jayden and Rico came through (what it do young nigga?)
Feelin' like I'm bulletproof
Got niggas that'll snuff your ass off of the roof
I talked her and left her, you wife her, good medic
I told her to dunk 'em like an alley-oop
Justin, Aston, CJ, nigga that's my crew
Can't forget about Pierre and NuNu
These niggas they fake like a motherfuckin' screw
Make they ass disappear like poof

[Outro]
Where they at though? where they at though?
Where they at, where they at, where they at though?
Where they at though? where they at though?
Where they at, where they at, where they at though?
I'ma smoke a nigga's ass like crack smoke
I don't even gotta smoke crack though
I don't even do none of that shit
Smokin' on that gas, make a nigga do a backflip
Ooh, I'm too high
