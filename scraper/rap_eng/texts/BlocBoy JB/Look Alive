[Intro: Drake, BlocBoy JB & Lil Juice]
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!
Yeah, yeah (ooh)
Yeah (ooh)
6 God, BlocBoy, 6 God, BlocBoy (ooh) (word)
6 God, BlocBoy, 6 God, BlocBoy (ooh) (BlocBoy, 6 God)
Yeah (hey)

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I— (hah)

[Verse 2: BlocBoy JB]
Bitch, come through (through)
You and you (you)
I'ma get the money (word)
Dr—Dr—Drizzy get the loot (the loot)
Pu—pu—pull up with that Draco (huh?)
Play with Drake and I'ma shoot (that's on my mama)
My—my—my weapon be a instrument
I'll blow you like a flute (rrah)
Ni—ni—nigga play so he feelin' it (feelin' it)
Pu—pull up broad day with a K, now he shiverin' (he shiverin')
Drop a nigga like he litterin' (huh?)
W—w—we at your door like we the delivery (yeah, yeah, yeah)
He not a plug, he middle man (middle man)
That—that nigga brown like cinnamon (cinnamon)
I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson (uh)
Shot to the chest have you gaspin' for oxygen (shots)
I'ma spray 'em, just like Febreze (huh, like Febreze)
Came a long way from sittin' in the nosebleeds (in the nosebleeds)
Now a nigga on the floor talkin' to the athletes (to the athletes)
Now I'm so close to the game that I could steal the stat sheet (stat sheet)
It's Bloc

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them to put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Outro: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
Behind me but I lied (that's on my mama)
