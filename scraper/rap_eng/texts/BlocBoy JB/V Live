[Intro]
Ayy, I got a rack
Run up in that house and tell that nigga give me that
Bad bitch with me, yeah you know I'm on that
Other bitch went off and I hit her from the back

[Verse 1]
Ayy, hold on
Got your bitch turned up, need to put some clothes on
Shots fired at his face if he play with my home
I keep one up in the chamber and I put one in your dome
If you play with my home
Them niggas on the other side playin', it's cool
Choppers fired at a nigga's land, on Duve
On Duve, on God, he ran, I sparked
Now I'm on the run for another murder charge
First degree, if you fuck with me, that's on God bitch
Mask on, when I'm down bad I'm on some rob shit
I up with the carbon, they duck when I start sparking
Ooh I caught my man, goddamn I hit my target

[Chorus]
Nigga playin', pull up get to sprayin'
I got them hitters in minivans
Search for you niggas from land to land
I sold your ass like a candyman
Put a hole up in your fitted
I'm in V-Live and it's litty
I got your bitch shaking ass and her titties
Foreign bitch and I think that she is British
You get to have like a minute

[Verse 2]
Squad up nigga, don't move
My niggas wanna jack with the tool
You see me, I see you
Royal rumble with the crew
Bitch I ball, Caillou, trappin' two-three schools
System on my tool just to help it cool
Hey hey hey, bitch I prayed for this
Bitch I'm made for this
And my niggas got paid for this
And I really get paid for hits
And my niggas hit crazy licks
Stake out your house from 'bout two to six
I heard that y'all niggas move the bricks
Ice cream, get to scoopin' shit
I got one hand, up on my pocket
Nigga playin' with Lil Bloc so I had to pop it
You like James Harden, I'm the fuckin' Rockets
I stand alone with the heat, guess I'm Chris Bosh-ing
Got the club rocking, freaky bitch give me her topping
Stop that shit, you know they watching
Gas and money, you know I got it
Got your honey giving money
Wash the bitch just like some laundry
Real nigga, can't take from me
Hilfiger, I keep a Tommy

[Interlude]
Keep a Tommy, keep a Tommy
Told the money, keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Hold them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, yeah
Throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw the money, yeah

[Chorus]
Nigga playin', pull up get to sprayin'
I got them hitters in minivans
Search for you niggas from land to land
I sold your ass like a candyman
Put a hole up in your fitted
I'm in V-Live and it's litty
I got your bitch shaking ass and her titties
Foreign bitch and I think that she is British
You get to have like a minute

[Outro]
Keep a Tommy, keep a Tommy
Told the money, keep it comin', keep it comin', keep it comin'
Hold them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, yeah
Throw them hundreds, throw them hundreds, throw the money, yeah
