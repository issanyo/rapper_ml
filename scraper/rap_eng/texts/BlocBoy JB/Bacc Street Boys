[Intro]
Woo
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Nah, I can fuck these niggas up better, man, you know what I'm sayin'
You know I'm that guy, hey, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Silencers on guns, yeah, we shoot everywhere we go
Bitch, we droppin' bombs on your coupe (Word), they like, "Where he go?" (Huh)
I do this shit for fun (Yeah), ayy, but you, nigga, you a ho (You a ho)
Don't try me, you a foolio (Word), I'm pullin' cards like Yu-Gi-Oh (That's on my mama)
Them backstreet boys gettin' too much money (Money)
I used to be broke, now I hit the club stuntin' (I'm stuntin')
I'm the same nigga that was sharin' clothes with my youngins (My youngins)
Now a nigga switch it up, flippin' hoes like they tumblin' (They tumblin')

[Verse]
12 for a bow, yeah, bitch, we get it cheap (Word)
If the traffic in the door, you can leave it where you sleep (Yeah)
I just did five shows (Yeah), I ain't changed in a week (Yeah, yeah)
200 bands in my pocket (Yeah), but I'm still actin' cheap (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ay, bitch, I'm actin' cheap (Word), all my diamonds neat (Neat)
We do drive-bys in the Jeep (Skrrt), 'cause, bitch, that's how we creep (Cr-creepin')
S-smokin' gas got my eyes low (Eyes low), I can't even see (See)
C-caught them niggas in the Tahoe, grab that Draco off the seat (Rrrah)

[Bridge]
Grab that Draco off the seat (Rrrah-rrrah-rrrah)
Grab that Draco off the seat (Word, word, word)
Grab that Draco off the seat (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Grab that Draco off the seat (Off the seat)

[Chorus]
Silencers on guns, yeah, we shoot everywhere we go
Bitch, we droppin' bombs on your coupe (Word), they like, "Where he go?" (Huh)
I do this shit for fun (Yeah), ayy, but you, nigga, you a ho (You a ho)
Don't try me, you a foolio (Word), I'm pullin' cards like Yu-Gi-Oh (That's on my mama)
Them backstreet boys gettin' too much money (Money)
I used to be broke, now I hit the club stuntin' (I'm stuntin')
I'm the same nigga that was sharin' clothes with my youngins (My youngins)
Now a nigga switch it up, flippin' hoes like they tumblin' (They tumblin')
