[Intro]
Hey man, hah
I'm in beast mode, you feel me?
Feel like Marshawn Lynch in this motherfucker, you heard me?
Ayy shut up lil ho
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit anyway
Always laughing at shit that ain't really just be funny
You know get you some money
Man matter fact break the cigar down, make yourself useful ho
Hah

[Verse]
I'm in beast mode
I'm a dog, put me on the leash mode
Hungry, I'm so hungry, I'm in feast mode
GTA, left down right up, ayy I got cheat codes
Plug with the chicos, they call me amigo
Nigga tried to rob me, he must thought this shit was water
Heard his daddy dead, time to send him to his father (that's on my mama)
Married to the money, told her meet me at the altar
Throw a bullet at you and you caught it, Miles Austin
Stone Cold Steve Austin, flexing like a wrestler
Spongebob, tartar sauce, flip it with the spatula
Fucked your bitch and pulled her tracks, she got mixed and mastered
Get my granny headed to the Bay, now that's a Packer
Thumbin' through the twenties backwards just because it's faster
Call you niggas Adam Sandler 'cause they is some actors
Bitch I'm respected, no pastor
You smell the kush every time I walk past you
Your bitch she watch me like I was a plasma
Polo tee, rock [?] Castro, ayy
Don't give a fuck what a hater say
By any means, bitch we gon' make a way
Thirty-six bows on the interstate
Andalé, andalé, andalé
You say that you got it, ain't nothin' else to say
I call up my takers now they on the way
They won't hesitate to take a nigga's face
Chopper up on him, make a nigga race

[Outro]
Woo, beast mode, beast mode, beast mode
Like I said man, I feel like Marshawn Lynch in this motherfucker man
I'm tryna get thirty of them touchdowns and get up in the backfield, you feel me?
Beast mode, beast mode, beast mode
