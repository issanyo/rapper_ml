Bitch, I will never tell, chopper tell-tell a tale

Shots in your stomach, bitch, how you gon' eat? (Word)

Walk in this bitch like my name Mr. T (Yeah)

Can't save these hoes, got no church in me (Doon-doon-doon)

You talk it, I know with that .22 TEC (Bow)
W-What you gon' do with it? Who gon' shoot with it?
