Chorus:
Everyday Is A Holiday, anutha muthafuckin dollar day (x4)

Verse 1:
Check this out
Call me Dr. strange, I be in tha lab
Concocting on a musical slab
Put it up, you get doubled for what you pay for
I got plenty skils and it chills see
As we creap thru da city AT-ail
All this shit ain't pretty, well I cock my Glock back
If you hot a junkie got to tell where da rock ya set
All apartments got dope spillaz
And they servin, watchin out for 12 squealaz
And well Atlanta's goin up, Atlanta's goin down
I bring the sound and I found a betta way
Sometimes a nigga gotta do like Barbie and Ken away
Since I gotta stay
Unemployed niggas don't pull it far
If it weren't for this music dope, I wouldn't have no job
Jiggy male

Chorus

Verse 2:
Check this out, keep all quarter cutted up
Lookin at da rocks in da sack, had his pockets from bein flat
Broke anutha choke off this dutch, I want to stop smokin bluntz
I need some fresh cunt
I bring the funk with swaids of the tongue, When I say whatz up
You know where I'm from
This watch survival tear, rappin iz da way to get it off my chest
Can't let this stress bleed, rollin thru these swats again
Made many, many muthafuckin new friendz
When I was 20 dope, I gotta get this flow, doin shows
See some G'z out in queens for the fed G'z
And let the toxin ease yo pain, where all the niggas at wit all tha gang
See all the kings in choice of power, this iz our hour
Poppin wide, listenin to this line
Jiggy male

Chorus
