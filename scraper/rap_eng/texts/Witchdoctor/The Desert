[Witchdoctor]
(SOS, SOS, this is Witchdoctor. Tell the captain to send a rescue chopper
My partner down, this desert ain't for me - Send a few bodybags)

[Chorus] {X2}
Momma, I'm ready to come home, where I belong
Cuz the desert is a warzone
Momma, I'm ready to sit at the table and eat
If I'ma die, I'd rather die in these dirty streets

[Verse 1: Witchdoctor]
My mentality is similar to a soldier's behavior
My brother did six months in a desert in Saudi Arabia
Nobody anticipated this war bein long-lastin
Too many soldiers get killed , they gon start draftin
In the streets, you need some loyalists on your team
And in the desert, you need a vest and an M16
In a war, you got the enemy tryin to pill you
But in the streets of Atlanta, you can get killed too
I feel you, bullets make you lay down like a mattress
Fuck a canteen, I'ma bite this cactus
I'm sweatin, ceiled mirage and water in a well
But I'm duckin from shrapnels and mortar shells
Run out a bank, surprised at dye-pack
Run out your foxhole, you can die in Iraq
Bush called the war and now the guns forever clappin
When I signed up for the Army, I didn't know this was gon happen

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 2: SOS]
(SOS joins end of chorus)
Than in the desert, dry lands
Holdin metal, dreadin Iran
Soldiers and generals are dyin fast
In the desert, you can hear them cry for momma
Back home they say to 'support the troops' but don't send em no armor
Like 'so long, goner.' talking to us like we're his young daughter
Like we don't know the difference between Saddam and Osama
One of em just can't be found
The other one they beat him once and they kicked him while he was down
Gah! I just don't believe this, please just, don't cry when you read this
But I feel like I'm much closer to Jesus
Than he is, and I don't agree with what they say
Killing people for peace like there isn't a better way
Ey! Isn't there, isn't there? They tell me not at all
They just a lotta talk, dropping bombs - Shock and Awe
But as long as we're strong we can all survive it
Praying for peace in the desert cause I'm tired of fighting

[Chorus] {X2}
