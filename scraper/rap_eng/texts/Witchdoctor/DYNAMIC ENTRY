(Kyd Wah-Lee Verse)
Well...Welcome Back
To That..
High...Life...
Movement....
Gimmie That..

I don't really think yall ready though..it was soft but now its war tiiime!
Sittin on a mountain of lines that i wrote
All of em laced wit crack and mad dope
Get smoked battlin me you can't cope
Cause you ain't got half the drive like tyco
I might have spoke words in wheels of mind sets
Cause i refuse to strike words like the trinity
Only one of them and thats enough for any MC
Even if he was squared homie could get smoked
Delayed double entendre's cause i set trends
Now im trying to make it cool to whip a mini van
Sittin damn near equivalent to heaven cause my weed only go in raw like its sexten
You should take a lesson from this higher up
And think if you could deal with dealin with this higher up
Cause we ain't takin no prisoners, 300
My city don't raise punks they all hunters

(Shintendo64 Verse)
Yoh..We're Terra Godz..Running Through Your Motherfuckin City Yall!...Planet Otokore...Whatup..

GIMMIE the microphone
Cuz I alone
Can rip the mic when hype
Ill Stomp the guts up out the whacker rhymers like a mike and Ike
To show em that Godz are all unique we never rhyme alike/
We're versatile niggas
In this mixture feel the lines of strife
Or
Feel the blinding lights
I'm in my shining armor
Rhyming tight
With a mask that strapped to the green ass of my snap
Ill Rip in half any half ass MC up on the map
With quoted lyrics from my guided intuition and crap
But fuck formalities
Cuz I'm not wit normality G
I'm a rappin maverick using magick casually sheesh
Living only for the feel of a crowd surfs or a deal for distribution
Moving Music to your groove list
That's true shit
