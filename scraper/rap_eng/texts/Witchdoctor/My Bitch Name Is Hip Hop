Verse 1:
See pimp a hippo and croc don't grow together
See bitch if I buy you a drink we go together
I'm a broke slash rich nigga
Sometimes it flip flops bitch niggas
Can't be a pimp then player hate
Bitch want to leave, pimp supposed to buy her skates
Used to have cowboys, gators and snakes
We can all wrestle, it's many tables to break
And I'm in A-Town before Deon "Neon"
Midwest niggas call you pussy niggas peons
Here's advice to you pimps on your wealth, see me through
You ain't got nann bitch 'til she want to be with you
I ain't got no six packs
You got beef I got a pistol, two pieces of bread
You gon' be a Big Mac
You gon' be a Big Mac

Cas Metah:
Verse 2:
While the world dreams in they sleep I'm sleeping with my dreams
Creeping with a freak known in the street as Melody
We met as teens and she ain't never let me leave
She sees other emcees and still always seems to meet my needs
Clean with no disease
She package with plastic, you'll even receive receipts
When she travel the map she bring me things
Like fans from Japan lands to Fiji seas
Ugh, pen in hand between these sheets
Tonight it's going down like Celly Cel doing DDT's
Blowing kiwi green blue as B.B. King
Trying to ride Melody until I see these beams of sunshine
I went from surviving to thriving but it wasn't over night son
Had to write something, get the right plugs
Fight thugs for my spot on the block
Still the cream of the crop, yeah

Hook:

She gon' bring all my money back
I'ma take my bitch named hip hop and put her on the track
I'ma take my bitch named hip hop and put her on the track
I'ma take my bitch named hip hop and put her on the track
She gon' bring all my money back
