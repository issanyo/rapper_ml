[Afu-Ra]
Yo, I'm straight rockin' it
Hit the block with it, chessboxing it
If I can't shoot it, I ox it

And I'm reppin' for Brooklyn, tools in my rocket
Broke right outta my cage, I'm gonna rock it
Ooh, that's how I spit, chill, yo I got this
I bust a move, one-two, shell shocking it
Put words together, make you stacking it, tackle it
I'm well endowed, and my flows quite accurate
I pull rabbits out my hat on some magic ish
Presto change-o, I do my thing, yo
Three sixty spin into Dr. Strange, yo
Wa-da-da-deng, wa-da-da-da-da-deng yo
Fuck gaming, and the gamer who spittin flames yo
I do this for my people whose minds in them chains yo
So everybody that's really to roll, get ready to eat
Because I'm cooking on this track yo

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
"I said hey hey hey hey"
You know I be the god of the rap, the couldn't hold me back"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea"
I'm burning that purple, dog, you want some of that?
"I said hey hey hey hey"
Wanna murder these tracks, the god, know how to act
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea"
I'm bout to rep with skills, hold on, they couldn't hold me back

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
I gotta be, all I can be
No matter what nobody wants from me
I gotta be, all I can
No matter what nobody wants from me
I had a revelation
To speak my mind with a good vibration
Aiy, don't matter what you saying
I'm hardcore with my rap and I ain't playing
I get around, get around, get around
Uh-huh, a force untold with so much soul
A twenty four karat heart of gold
I get around, get around, I get around
Uh-huh, a stop drop and rock, and shock yo town
Listen to the way that I scream it now

[Hook]

[Afu-Ra]
Wanna run up? Put the smackdown, crack down
On the track now, matter fact, it's a fact now
Million stops, earthquakes from the beats, move the streets
I got the treats and it's a rap now
My sex is engulfed in a small pack of pow wow
I weigh the crowd for having a sound
That astounds the pounds, of leading to the track to the ground
And surround clowns with more color in they faces
In any circus in any town, uptown, downtown
Straight up and down, holler at the moon, now
Straight bring it to your face, kid
Blind ya like the police, sprayin' that mace, kid
I get around, get around, get around
Uh-huh, a stop drop and rock, and shock ya town
Listen to the way that I scream it now
