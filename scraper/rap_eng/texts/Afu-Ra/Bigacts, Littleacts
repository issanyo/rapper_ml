[Intro]
Yeah, Perverted Monk representin'
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1: Afu-Ra]
No need for cappin' this
Brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, match this lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin' sandstorms, I'll freeze ya, then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt ya on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These miracles I'm wieldin' straight echoes through the building
Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of an eye
Terminate unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars while they constelate
The heart rate of my social eloquence makes sense
Intense with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous type of figure
So check it out, now you know
When you lookin' at a real nigga

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle? Which rapper thinkin' they the nicest?
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

[Verse 2: GZA]
You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash, from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
Snakes out, hissin', the shots missin'
Observe, and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice that means he's rollin' with loaded dice
It's like gettin' stabbed with ice and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt
Commissioner revoked ya belt, the microphone
Microphone flower, fresh shower
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin', ride the 808 Roland
Write 'til my hand's swollen, you're no comp, ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle? Which rapper thinkin' they the nicest?
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless
We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle? Which rapper thinkin' they the nicest?
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

[Verse 3: Afu-Ra]
Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves then the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick, and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than a fuckin' cactus
Conquerin' globes, and universes with Galactus
Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin' intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next to L shapes, the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate, but now I'm yellin' checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle? Which rapper thinkin' they the nicest?
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless
We rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle? Which rapper thinkin' they the nicest?
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless
