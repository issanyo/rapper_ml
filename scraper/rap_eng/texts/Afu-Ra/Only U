[Hook: Afu-Ra]
I just wanna ride with you
I just wanna ride with you
I just wanna roll with you

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]
Hey hey, hey, we light it up everyday
And always seem to go when something fresh to say
Hey hey hey, hey we light it up everyday
I'm talking what you talking, are you going my way?
Hey hey, hey, we light it up everyday
I'm talking what you talking, are you going my way?
Hey hey, hey, we light it up everyday
And always seem to come when something fresh to say

[Afu-Ra]
Look at me now, I'm on the come up, done up, what up, what up
Now we can build all night, until the sun'll come up
Have some of the raps yea, we blaze and blazin'
Til my eyes roll back in my head, I feel amazing

[Chorus: Afu-Ra]]
Hey hey, hey, we light it up everyday
I'm talking what you talking, are you going my way?
Hey hey, hey, we light it up everyday
And always seem to come when something fresh to say

[Hook: Afu-Ra]
I just wanna ride with you
I just wanna ride with you
I just wanna roll with you
And only you, I

[Afu-Ra]
That's right, purple haze, white widow, yeah, get me settled
I burn pirates in my head, hit the grittle, hello
Then talk about trees, so long, I put it in a song
Smoking a bong, like Cheech and Chong, that's right
We bubble it up, we bubbling up
And all my hydro home girls, aiyo, y'all know what's up
And all my fellas that's risen, y'all play the backwoods
Get your head right, come on, y'all know it's good

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Afu-Ra]
If you like your bats fat and your blunts real long
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
I like my bags real fat, and my spliff's real long
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
Don't you like your bags fat, and your spliff real long?
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on
I like my bats real thick, and my blunts real long
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on

[Chorus 2x]
