Yo Afu (Yo whassup?)
Yo yo, c'mere c'mere
Yo let's freak that rhyme we was freakin the other night
(Yo I'm wit it yo just set it off)
I'm sayin though, after this, it's no turnin back 'Fu
(Aiyyo just set it off man)

[Verse 1: Jeru the Damaja (Afu-Ra)]
Pugilistic linguistics
Check out the mystics, we're fantistic (You mean fantastic)
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics (Vanacrobatics)
Vocabulary calisthenics, can't under-
Stand, the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style, but also peep the lyrics
My lightning, my thunder, way back I stomped out
Heracles, but now I stomp out emcees
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titanium
Alchemist, I turn wax into platinum

[Verse 2: Afu Ra]
Influential, scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour at a crazy rate
I'm speedin' through your circuits
And I perforate ya data banks
Stamina in the brain is how I slay it
I enforce my voice and I always must obey it
Endorsin' of central rhymin' remedies
Against any man at arms that can get with the
Eternal, internal alchemist
I spill logic and science, ever since
Throwing cerebral blows without my fist
Poisonous Taoist
Don't mess with toys in this racket
Terrorists don't proceed to hijack it

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
It's too perverted, you heard it, so now you get murdered
Test the sound system, it throws off your equilibrium
Deep concentration can't fracture the meditation
Competition is flipped on at random
Deviant monks attack the mic, it's mental pandemonium
And then some, you go for your hand gun
Psychokinetic forces proceed to smash in your cerebellum
Phonetician with more stamina than a Christian
My mind, C3H5N3O9 like nitroglycerine
I bust as Afu-Ra crush, clash with us and meet Cerebus

[Verse 4: Afu-Ra]
Ready, ridiculous ravagery as I commence
I whirlwind through cities
Breaking down substances, combining matter
Test my hand skills and back bones splatter
Rough and tough although the mental will stomp ya
Pugilism electrocute like Blanka
Collaborate all my words into verses
I instill the will without even curses
Slurs, escapade off the beat
Totally complete with the unique physique
Microcosmic warrior, indeed, I'll destroy ya
And this mic, I'm taking over
