[Hook]
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can too
If you wanna pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you wanna rock the ice, and your style is tight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
It's the, rap spectacular, cardiovascular
You see these lyrics they gonna laugh at ya
You wanna take it to the streets movin backwards
Straight up and down, you get slapped up like Cassius
And if they want holes hook 'em with a catheter
Mental manipulation like Blackula
Controllin forces knockin soldiers off their horses
Whether the Benz or the Rolls Royce's
Ain't nothin close to kilometer Testa Rosa
Body barometer, pop just like a toaster
I heat and freeze it off simultaneously
Instantaneously, ain't no one worthy but me
I hold my head like a sire for a second
The state of hip hop in my head went through blizzards
Now I hokus pokus regain my focus
I got to keep it movin move smoother than Braggadocios

[Hook]
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can too
If you wanna pop a slug, gimme a clue
If you wanna shock the sights, and you're outta sight
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
Inferable, impenetrable, mineral, serial
Spiritual, visuals, sprinkle mics with my lyricals
I use astrophysics and aeronautics
Biologically technical unpointed message view
The type to snatch danger right out your passage view
I bring it back to the essence was
Exodus, wanna get next to us
Honeys doin doobies, but the booties gettin rushed

[Hook]
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can too
If you wanna pop the bubb', gimme a clue
If you wanna rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
You got beef that I'm a stomp with this, bombs I launch wit this
Peep the flames from my orifice, I'm off wit this
Betta call your boss for this, I'm squashin 'em, you
Ain't goin far my friend
Insatiable unstoppable, syllable, module
It's logical the diabolical after my molecules
I had to enhance my thought pharmaceuticals
Lyrics is literal paintin pictures daily rituals
I like to free verse from coast to coast
On boats and boast, files be dope and dope
Open scopes, Afu is like hope on a rope
Goin for broke, I make sing somethin I wrote

[Hook]
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can to
If you wanna pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you wanna rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can too
If you wanna pop a slug, give me a clue
If you wanna rock the ice, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right

[Afu-Ra]
Peep this modern day follow through, nothin will boggle you
Suggest I hit them with the darts, now they jiggle too
Now ladies taste a lick, and lick the lyrical liquor
Takin a swigger, checkin her figure, countin her figga's
Some roll through on that real type Perrelli 'ish
Some roll through on that meet me at the telli 'ish
Evidently, evidence stains for centuries
I carve my name in your head like I'm a memory
I'm composin with the Beethoven slogan
Year 3000 on the run like I'm Logan
Change the gases, switch my anti matter
You see I spent about ten life times as a rapper

[Hook]
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can to
If you wanna pop the bubb', give me a clue
If you wanna rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right
If you wanna rock the clubs, you can too
If you wanna pop a slug, give me a clue
If you wanna rock it tight, and your style is right
Well you gotta tell 'em, yo, they gotta bring it right
If you wanna go to clubs, you can too
If you wanna pull the plug, gimme a clue
If you wanna rock the mic, and your style is right
Well, you gotta tell 'em, yo, you gotta bring it right
