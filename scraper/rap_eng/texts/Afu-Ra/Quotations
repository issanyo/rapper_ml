[Afu-Ra]
You wanna roll with the alphanumerical
Lyrical, serial syllable killa wit the realness
Feel this, mix tape shots, I peal this
Ayatollah, strike like Casanova
Give me a beat, and my styles, I run it over
Corner ya brain, like a game of chess, nah
How a million MC's gon' be the best
You couldn't go against the squad, if your rhymes was hard
What made you think that you can challenge the stars?
Don't go against the grain, insane, ready to aim
No stoppin a, rockin a, hip hop philosopher
MC's and DJ's, your urban opera
I said it, intelligently, ain't nuthin next to me
Certainly, you couldn't even deal wit my weaponry
I interject like the Internet, wet ya sets
Ya ain't even heard nuttin yet
