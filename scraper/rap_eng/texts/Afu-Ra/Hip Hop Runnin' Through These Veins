"Plus equipped with mental hardware" - Jeru - Frustrated Nigga

[Verse 1 - Afu-Ra]
My name is Afu-Ra yes I be the lyrical wonder
And with rapstyles on this mic I'm bringin' thunder
In any state place your city or your country
Check it then see if you can step to me
Oh yes I whirlwind with the physical and spiritual tactics
My microphone stunts is doin' backflips
Check it, I formulate my data then I scatter
I drop more jewels I make your headpiece splatter
This combination I rip ya up like the chia
Lyrical Kazuya, what, I rip right through ya
My vocal types form I break backs with Hichi Achi
Trashin' emcees I open bellies like a Yoshimitsu
My axe keep hits sparks ya mental
While I get down I'm unique and influential
Scientific electric I'm breakin' bolders
Hold the weight of the earth on my back and on my shoulders
We get down like this, legend of the Iron Fist
KnawhaImsayin Perverted Monks in the house
Represent Brooklyn knawhaImsayin Manchester wherever

[Verse 2 - Afu-Ra]
I, I came up in this click rushed by Nina
Had to get busy because the style she had was mean-ah
She broke me open the crazy combo's where chokin'
Around house a straight up jouse with any brother
She's rougher than leather she's tougher than nails
She closed my eyes shelf I had to read it in braille
I came up off the floor she chopped me in the neck
I had to get mine, yo, I had to catch wreck
I went into her thunder god fist and miss
Every time I turned around there was a kick
She had so many moves at the end my head was open
I had to kick out when my leg was cold and broken
I guess I wasn't up to par being law
I had to be cool I had to go fix my scars
The next time I touch these buttons I be ready
I won't be the devil cause I'm not evil like Eddie
I restructure til combust to bust ya
Emcees could never stop my gold shine or luster
I'm telepathic call my squad in til Armageddon
I know you couldn't stop the revolution..or the polution
And gettin' busy cause I come through ya city
Check it out, Perverted Monks
The Iron Fist the legend must persist

[Verse 3 - Afu-Ra]
You know I'm back again, I had to get under ya skin
My sound brings the drama like Kuma
You know that I would do ya if I would step to ya
The Iron Fist master, peep the virtual disaster
You couldn't stop this Iron Fist super powers
Death blows I come through with ten hit combo's
You couldn't test the flow, now you know
Check it out, Iron Fist, the legend persists
