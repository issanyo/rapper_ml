(Chorus)
What's going on what could it be
What's going on it seems to me
A sense of focus focus
I know somebody knows this
Your life your path your essence
Well let me tell you something

(Verse 1)
Poisonous get with this so come and sit with this
I speak truth from the mouth so come and get with this
Why do you say I type lyrical while I conversate
Rockin the mic just for my minerals
I take it to the streets for steals pity you
Get stoned magical, real, as in my miracles
Drip Drop my hip hop yo
I'm doin my kung fu stance on one leg like it was hopscotch
Blew up the spot when the sound stops rockin
They steelin up your nickel bags, well this is tappin
Some MCs just yappin and they flapping
They listen to your whole album and nothin happen
I get a snap before the blind eyes def ears
No need for palos my jewel sounds for years

(Catch)
Yo I make it happen when the sound stops rockin
Soon we get it poppin once the sound stops rockin
Yo I make it happen once the sound stops rockin
I steelin up your nickel bags well this is tappin

(Verse 2)
Rap senses in well it's a begin again
Step to me I constellate and I finish 'em finish 'em
Realians Vesilians sowinigan
Rockin your N Hydrogen and Oxygen
Pardon me for steppin on your moccasins
Reveiling statements in here to rock your N
Unified nations the viatons
Set off the satellites
Mark off the first space station
Magnificent filament I represent
The audiovisual ill shit
Brake loose crazy legs
Houdini perverted realist
And I be buggin out (Why's that?)
How some MCs can do all those shows
And get all that dough and still find time to be thuggin out
No diplomatic immunity
Your pitidy is perjury
For the four uses of the surgery

(Catch v. 2)
Yo We make it happen once the sound stops poppin
Yo We make it happen once the sound stops rockin

(Chorus)
Whats going on what could it be
Whats going on it seems to me
A sense of focus focus
I know somebody knows this
Your life your path your essence
Well let me tell you something

(Verse 3)
Dive into the cosmos, and I float and float
No need for vehicles my body's the host
Clear that throat got that flem
Ah Ah Em
No need for light skills cause I build my house on a rim
Yo wanna fabam this, takular, blackular, establishments
My encriments and sentiments is like cement
Hardcore deep through the epicenter
Speak to a word and clear to a blur
You wanna know how we got here?
And differenciated forms came together

(Catch v.3)
Yo we get it poppin once the sound stops rockin
Yo we make it happen once the sound stops rockin
Yo we get it poppin once the sound stops rockin
I steelin up your nikel bags well this is tappin

(Chorus)
Whats going on what could it be
Whats going on it seems to me
A sense of focus focus
I know somebody knows this
Your life your path your essence
Well let me tell you something

(Chorus v.2)
Whats going on it seems to me
Whats going on what could it be
A sense of focus focus
I know somebody knows this
Your life your dreams your essence
Well let me tell you something

(chorus v. 3)
Whats going on what could it be
Whats going on its seems to me
A sense of focus focus
I know somebody knows this
Your life your dreams your failures
Well let me tell you something
Your hopes your lifes your essence
Well let me tell you something
