[Intro]
You feel me?

[Chorus]
In the mirror, I'm looking at the shadow
If I bash her, I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

In the mirror, I'm looking at the shadow
If I bash her, I'll probably would just shatter
Broken pieces that represent my mind
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

Cause I know what I'm feeling
And I know what is real
Broken pieces that represent my heart
Broken pieces keep falling from my heart

[Verse 1]
Everyday when I wake up, I wanna see your face and I
Realize that you will never apologise
For your lies and all the ways you hurt me
And I know in my mind that you ain't worthy
But when I look in the mirror
I see this girl who keeps crying, she's crying
She's still inlove with you
But I tell her not to cause she's a wilding, she's wilding
I don't know what she's thinkin about
Get it together or I'm kicking you out (of the mirror)
I'm getting you out of my system
My vision premonition (of the mirror)
And I listen to my answers and free my soul from prison

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
My patience a plastic bag and he kept filling it
Carrying baggage of others is where I emptied it
Play the fool before, I'm not about to let you enter
My mind for my heart draws the bigger picture
His presence embrace me
His loving so greatly
I miss the way we
Used to sit up all night and talk about nothing, on the phone
Please, how could you get so weak
When you know you deserve so much better
And rather than settle for less
Just let the best play catch up
When the time's right they'll find you
If you choose to do not do
The best I could do is warn and inform you
The mirror

[Chorus]
