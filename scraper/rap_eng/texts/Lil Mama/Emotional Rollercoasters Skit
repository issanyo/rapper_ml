[Spoken:]
Well there's many girls of my age group
Come out of their teenage years
And going into womanhood
Becoming a young lady and they go threw
Different like... emotional rollercoasters
And when you on a rollercoaster
Like in regular life you can't get off
In the middle of the ride

You gotta ride it out until it stops
And at the end of that ride
It feel like that rollercoaster was fun
Even though it might had a couple of
Twirls, Spins and Drops that made you cry
