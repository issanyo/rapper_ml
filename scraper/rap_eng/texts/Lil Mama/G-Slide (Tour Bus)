[Intro: Lil Mama's Sister and Lil Mama]
If my sister tour bus, ride through your town
You're gonna have a problem, tell um Lil' Mama !

Uh uh, no way, you can show me how [x2]
Uh uh, no way, you can show me how
You can show me how

[Verse 1 : Lil Mama]
When I bump up on the track it's like
(Whoomp, there it is)
From the block parties to house parties
I gets it in
I'ma bump my Bee's and knees
And that's exactly what I meant
Young beast from the East
So you know I puts it in
I'm that ghetto gorgeous gangster girl
With the fly G slide international (is wretch you know)
By the way that I bounce on the track (you know)
You ain't never see a girl like this (oh no)
My whole team fly high
We ride 'till we die
Run into dudes who be
Yapping and always trying to get by
But I don't hear
It goes in one ear and out the other
Taught him how to G-slide and he taught his mother
Get get down big Mama'
I can dig it that you got it
But when my block starts the G
A stampede startin'

[Hook]

[Kadar]
Lil' Mama get it poppin' puttin' work (I put it work) [x3]
Lil' Mama get it poppin' puttin' work (Hey!)

[Verse 2 : Kadar]
New shirt (New shirt)
New kicks (New kicks)
New ants
G-slide the new dance
No auto maw
We live in the new times
Lil' ma must've artist for me
Is the new grime
More money, more money
More shine
She the princess of the city
I'm her son boy shine
Top the dime
Shorty got cake like uh
Duncan Hines, come on G-slide

[Lil Mama]
They be callin' me T in the hood cause I bring the Pain daddy
And when the time is going down
Make you ring daddy
That mean you got to feel me
Cause I'm might make you fly
And if you G-slide slow
You better pick it up
G-slide with me
Be shy do it
See shorty lookin' over from the side viewin'
I'm 'bout to hook him up
And show him how to do it
Slide right, slide left
Hit time

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Lil Mama]
Lil' mama get it popping
Stand on the streets so the people yell
Just lookin' at me like
No fair, I'm here, no fair
And my heart gonna nip you girls
I bet you gonna live no losses
I switch verses like sauces
That prego sauce be poppin
She so hot
When I go bring them down to popping
Now you tip and try to touch
May end up with red spots
When it's hot, then it's hot
If it ain't, then it's not
No wait, you walk over
There's no room up on the spot
Cause I spot little creatures trying to turn beast (turn beast)
Go feast
They better turn because I'm red meat (meat)
And it's wait wait to see me
While I do it for the TV
In the hood
In the hood
Is probably where I must be (be, be, be...)

[Hook]
