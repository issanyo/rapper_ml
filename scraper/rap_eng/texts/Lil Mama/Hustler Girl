Everytime i see her she be countin' that money. I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl
My numba one hustler girl (3x)
Little shorty hold me down
Even when i'm not around
Rollin' in and outta town
So i gotta get a crown to my number one hustler girl
To my number one hustler girl
And she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene
I done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her
My number one hustler girl
She my number one hustler girl

1st verse:
Uh, sometimes i get higher to cope with reality. I'm a hustler and ain't nobody bad as me, nah. Metaphorically, heavy strategy
Thoughts through my mind that be caused cause of agony
Listening to great telling me to say somethin' . Still i says nothin' cause i know they can't tackle me (keep running, uh yeah). They came back with me. Home runner. Home slugga (??)
, Home actually, with myself like Dorothy and the great wizzard. Knocked out, punch game is exquisit. When i'm in the ring, i can't see the pain. I just shine like MJ and Billy Jean. Bring fire to the camp.....(???) (explosion)
Burn rings like ring... (??). Ya'll hail for the day i rain. Till i make it flood. Young never came. Yeah
Everytime i see her she be countin' that money. I can tell by swagg she's a number one stunna girl. Been around the whole world, and i ain't never seen no hustler girl
My numba one hustler girl (3x)
Little shorty hold me down
Even when i'm not around
Rollin' in and outta town

To my number one hustler girl
And she all about her queen fly, when she hit the scene
I done been around the world. And, i ain't never seen her
My number one hustler girl
She my number one hustler girl

2nd verse:
It's a new day and age. Rugrats grown up. Last bagony (??). Ya'll gone shown up (see how the story's spin around) go nuts. When I peel out. Dust. And it's over. Who ya'll gon' call?. Ghostbusters. The big or the small. Brooklyn. Where we ball baby ball. Out, till it hurt and we fall. Karate kid, limp it out. Bring your set. Dip it out. Who's stoppin' me. Nobody. Er'body love Er' Er' body, godmommy. Pushing 2'45, bulgatty. Featherweight, lean body. Ghost, can't see me. Hustling hard. Make it look easy
