I got a lot of shoes
I got a lot of boots
But I don’t pick and choose
I rather go and cruise
It’s funny how I’m icy
But I drop a lot of jewels I’m wise
Imagine if I woulda stayed in school
I’m a fool but I still be pro-ing with the tools
And that’s just how I do
When I be doin what I do
I switch gears
Drop tops while y’all snooze
Top tier yeah
I could never lose
