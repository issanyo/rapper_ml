[Verse: Lil' Mama]
Wine down through my timeline ya I caught him lurkin'
Liking all my pic like he tryna put that work in
He ain't know I be in bags I'm in my Birken
Ya, ya, ya I left him jerkin'
For certain you gon' get this work this is not an option
2016 got a lot of music dropping
Tell the promoters we gon' get the club popping
If ain't about the money then we ain't talking
I'm with some bosses, my company flooded with bosses
In in designer I cop I rock it its flawless
I go retarded 'til I get my palm on the target
I'm sharp but the tip of my fingers they polished
Diamonds a girl's best friend
So when I shining, don't you pretend
Like you gon' get this work, you gon' get this work
You gon' get this work, you gon' get this work
Until I'm dead and gone

[Verse: Rihanna]
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi
Work, work, work, work, work, work
He said me haffi
Work, work, work, work, work, work!
He see me do mi
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt!
So me put in
Work, work, work, work, work, work
Ner ner ner ner ner ner!
When yuh ago learn learn learn learn learn learn!
Before the tables turn turn turn turn turn turn!
Beg you something please
Baby don't you leave
Donâ€™t leave me stuck here in the streets, uh huh
If I get another chance to
I will never, no never neglect you
I mean who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm tryin', babe!!!
Haffi, work, work, work, work, work, work
