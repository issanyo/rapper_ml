[Verse 1]
From the second he drops you off
That's when you stopped blowing me up
Telling me took them all now
Acting like you've got controller
Just when I thought that I had enough
That's when I remembered you touch
After the weekend in Florida
How could I ever ignore ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely

[Chorus]
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

[Verse 2]
Wasting no time girl you're on my body
You're trembling, I bet you want me
Baby, you can't resist it
I back up put you insist it
You told me that it's alright
So I take you into the night
But it lets me touch ya
'Cause I know he loves ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely

[Chorus]
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

[Lil' Mama:]
What is you delusional
Take the time that I put into loving you can never be me just using you
My body waved like an ocean when I'm cruising you
To the eyes they broke this [?]
Triangle in love and I'm craving in love
And I'm sorry if I'm angry in love, but this is dangerous love
[?] me up
I know enough is enough but I can't enough
Call me!

[Drake Bell:]
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, baby
You only call me when you're lonely, baby

Know that when it goes hot
Can always hit my phone up
Know it's only luck
You call me when you're lonely, baby
Call me when you're lonely, lonely
