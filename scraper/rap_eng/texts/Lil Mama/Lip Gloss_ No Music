[Verse 1:]
Mac mac Loreal yep 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I put it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway they can't say nothing
Oh oh oh my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the mac mac brushes
Loreal got the most watermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
When it's time for lunch
My lips still rock
Lil mama melon with the hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla
Flavors is a virtue they
Loving, lip gloss universal
The boys really like it the girls don't speak
They rolling they eyes

It ain't my fault
But I upgrade ya

[Hook]

[Rap:]
No music, Oh

She ain't wack, so I tell her corny you can hand that
To a record label while I get my hair wrapped
Then I let it fall under my NY Yankee cap
Anybody that know better that got cheddar
Betta go getta 'cause y'all already know I'm where its at
And if I'm rollin I'm ridin' I got my homies beside me
I tell Ben drop me Yorkee like where it at
I get to poppin and lockin that low I don't play
And all my swag is official that's what my flow say
And any club if its poppin my record gone play
R.I.P to Haza Lo Zaza

[Verse 3:]
Sittin' in 8th period
Thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like
Yes Ms. McClarkson?
She like girl ran out of my lip gloss and
Write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit
That bubblegum
Is popping, is popping
Is popping she ain't fronting
And uh

I be using it I be I be using it and uh
I be rubbing it I be I be rubbing it on my lips
My lips my lip gloss
