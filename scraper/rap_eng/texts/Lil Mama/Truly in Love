(Lil Mama)
Lonely...ok i am ready

It makes me crazy, crazy jealous when i ask around
I'am always thinkin bout you when you're not around and
Only time will tell if we are truly in love

(Peter Toh)
If you are truly truly in love
If we were truly truly in love

(Lil Mama)
Lately late nights all i seem to think about is
How theres more and boring thinks to think about
Then you, well honestly i, i just can't stop around we go

(Chorus)
(Lil Mama & Peter Toh)
If you are truly truly in love...
If we were truly truly in love
Tell me so if you are truly truly in love
If we were truly truly in love...round we'll go

(Lil Mama)

(verse 1)
I anit got like what i ain't gone like
You anit gone like what you anit gone like
Differences look at us breakup makeup break but its all alright
I still got seat belt on tight
Told you what its like on a tough ride right
You betta talkin wrong cuz i dont stop at no yellow lights
Fist signs nuffin thats sumthin to do wit sumthin
Ya friends say its sumthin thats nuffin to do wit nuffin
I anit frontin...no i anit frontin
Cuz they more they talk the more we fight
The more that wrong that could have went right
The more we fight the more we might part some more t
He more they like and that anit right....
No that anit right
So we talk to each other and grow, grow wit each other
You know how theses witches be doin
We cold water we be stuntin....oh we be stuntin they grow

(Lil Mama)

(hook)
Cuz we develop together forever
Wherever whenever i tell ya i, iam truly in love

(Chorus)
(Lil Mama & Peter Toh)
If you are truly truly in love...
If we were truly truly in love
Tell me so if you are truly truly in love
If we were truly truly in love...round we'll go

(Lil Mama)
Baby i all want is you to understand that
I'd be out of my mind if you wasn't right here
And all i want is you to feel the way that i feel

(Peter Toh)
The way that you make me feel the way that you make me feel

(Lil Mama)
I know one day I might wake up and I know that
You are in the world it won't matter to me at all just a memory

(Lil Mama)

(hook)
Cuz we develop together forever
Wherever whenever i tell ya i, i am truly in love

(Chorus)
(Lil Mama & Peter Toh)
If you are truly truly in love...
If we were truly truly in love
Tell me so if you are truly truly in love
If we were truly truly in love...round we'll go
