Now let's get it clear
I was born in Kings County, yeah
East New York Brooklyn, ain't no hope in here
Where the hood be clear we the champs in here
'Cuz I made it past go yeah, pass that here
That 2 bills, signed two for 2 mil
Mama too real and the hood is gon' feel

Why I'm on top of my game and on top of the brain
Contain hot lava, waterboys can't bring
I guess that's why they say I'm off my rocker
Spill off a 4 mag and rock they hopin' they get a piece of me
One of the fewest female MCs of the century, [???] explode from morbid obesity
They mad at me, I ain't mad 'cuz they been hatin' [???]
Been throwin' salt in the wound and mama been skatin'
Past them, leave patterns like one hit please
And pickin' up the pieces gon' create that key to the city!

One Hit Wonder or one hit please
Once I hit 'em with one they gonna need
A flight to catch up with me
I'm going straight to the top, whoa

Go!
Here I go hit
Here I, here I go-ooo
Here I go hit
Here I, Here I go-ooo
I'm going straight to the top, whoa!


When Lil' Mama get on the big track like this
They be like "How you do that like this"
Here's a trip then flow like this
I'm thinkin' preposterous
I just groove to the beat like this
And it is what it is
They be like she do that right
She does what she did
And I runs with the best
DJ Khaled, The Runners
The voice of the young people is really on it
And as long as I'm around you'll always be second best, see
First loser, runner up, close but no cigar, see
Some people try to part me
Click heels like dorothy
It's a mission hatin' bitches
And bitches tryin' to start me
To finish like a color book maze puzzle
Real fast so they get credit, I leave 'em puzzled, uhh!

One Hit Wonder or one hit please
Once I hit 'em with one they gonna need
A flight to catch up with me
I'm going straight to the top, whoa

Go!
Here I go hit
Here I, here I go-ooo
Here I go hit
Here I, Here I go-ooo
I'm going straight to the top, whoa!

In the car (whoa)
In the crib (whoa)
In the club (whoa)
On the block (whoa)
On the job (whoa)
So I'm gon' get that guap (whoa)
Whoa, see how far underestimating go
Probability a thing tho so what you guessin' for
Never flow been so so, flow never been so so
Yo yo, that's what they saying 'cuz they know
I'm 'bout to pop and paparazzi abotu to pay homage
I'm out the box and talking like it's child play homie
This ain't a toy story, but I'm going straight to the top
In Buzz Lightyear gear
Push my button, I'm out

One Hit Wonder or one hit please
Once I hit 'em with one they gonna need
A flight to catch up with me
I'm going straight to the top, whoa

Go!
Here I go hit
Here I, here I go-ooo
Here I go hit
Here I, Here I go-ooo
Here I go hit
Here I, Here I go-ooo
I'm going straight to the top, whoa!
