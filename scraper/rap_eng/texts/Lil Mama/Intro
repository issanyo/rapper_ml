[Random Talking]

Random person: What does the voice of the young people mean?

Lil Mama: "It might not mean something to someone else but it means a lot to me"
"If y'all see eye to eye, you have something to accomplish"
"I don' think that parents should sugar coat information from kids because you're going to get it raw in the streets anyways"
"So VYP, to me is just sharing that voice, that real voice of life experiences, covering the youth and me, and there is a youth in everybody"
"I'm keeping it strictly 100 % real"
