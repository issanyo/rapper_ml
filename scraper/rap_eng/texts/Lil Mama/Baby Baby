[Intro:]
Uh uh, baby baby
Uh uh, baby

[Verse 1:]
You're the mission up in this option
I ain't walking round here topless
(Baby, baby)
I know them girls be getting it popping
Strange way of getting it popping
(Baby, baby)

And if you can't see it through these jeans
Then you won't see it up on me
(Baby, baby)
It's best to tell you don't waste your time
Your eyes don't make me fine
(Baby, baby)

[Chorus:]
I ain't heard that G.A.M.E
You give you my love
If you can't see that
I ain't giving you whatever you want, boy

I ain't another toy in ya toybox for me
It's my love
And my love ain't free
It's your mama's fault
That you can't see that

It's all good
Pick up your fate, boy
It's all good
Pick up your fate, boy
All my girlz like
(Uh uh, baby baby, uh uh, baby baby)

[Verse 2:]
A good boy
Stop the promising
Ever since good boys ain't so common
And good sense ain't so common

Go head
Make stupid look real funny then
Tomorrow might be every word in the hook
So call me every word in the book
(Baby, baby)

It's best to tell you
Don't waste your time
Your eyes don't make me fine

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

[Lil Mama:]
Karina, when he thinks he a pimp
What you tell 'em?

[Karina:]
See you call it pimping
But I call it slipping

[Lil Mama:]
Cause we don't get down like that (no)

[Karina:]
I'ma say what I say
With or without your attention
(Uh, uh, baby, uh, uh, baby)

[Lil Mama:]
I been up this block so long
Like old timers
Thought he stand for good cause like Obama

Through my girls
Some smart, some dumber
The smart was [?]
[?]
(Baby, baby)

The hotter it got
The more they took off
And the hotter I got
The more I took off

Fly like an eagle
Tell the boy I don't need 'em
Karina, mama leader
The voice of the young people

[Repeat Chorus:]
