[Verse 1: Vanessa Hudgens]
When I'm all broke down
Heading for disaster
And I'm spinning 'round
Trying to find a clue
And my head is tired
Searching for the answers
Can't figure out
How I'm gonna get through the next ten minutes

[Chorus: Vanessa Hudgens]
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?

[Verse 2: Vanessa Hudgens]
When I'm all burnt down
Need a place to run to
No one hears me shout
Lost and all alone
And I'm losing ground
No one understands me
Can't figure out what I'm gonna do, 'cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Vanessa Hudgens]
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?

[Verse 3: Lil' Mama]
If I could think of you and smile
Ask you could you stay a while
Even if you gotta go
Chase your dough, that's for sure
It's my love you're raising
With my heart, you're praising
Passion, is you're staying, ain't that amazing?
They be calling it a phase, we gon' keep phasing
Some don't wanna play the game
So they keep acing, that's a loser
See me, imma keep chasing
Chasing this dough

[Chorus: Vanessa Hudgens]
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?
Baby, I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby, I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby, I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh?
