[Chorus:]
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown (drown)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown
He wanna swim

[Verse 1:]
Straight out of the ocean I was raised in the water
Find my way to swim shore to the boy with two legs me I'm a mermaid
Different lifestyles and?
He wanna swim

And I don't mind that
But I don't know if can keep up with where I'm at
I'm surrounded by sharks and they all bite
And quick to attack if they sense what they don't like like
He can't swim with me
Cause if I walk with him
He gon' still my speed so I can't talk to him
But if he keep up and fight through the waves
Fight through the pressure and the gust of your days
Test water with toes and dive in brave
You better follow your nose cause I'm so hey hey
Hard to catch up with so he can't fit
Threw his life jacket on and still can't catch this
Girl

[Chorus:]
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown (drown)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown
He wanna swim

He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown (drown)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown
He wanna swim

[Verse 2:]
In the part of the water that drip drip drip from a piece that boarder
Nates on my wardrobe
Hate with my wardrobe
Don't match with my boy oh
He wanna swim

With with I
Come and doggy paddle with a girl so fly
Talkin' a boy he ain't never seen a girl like my my ha ha ha
He wanna swim

I know that game
You better off keepin' it real for a change
Makin' things more than I knew they was
And he doin' that just because
He wanna swim

From the pond to the pool to the river to the ocean
Boy I see you
Enter my world you'll see how we do
No stat work work premiere to
Preview ooo

[Chorus:]
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown (drown)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown
He wanna swim

He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
He walking but he wanna swim with me (swim with me)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown (drown)
Either way there's no way he gon' drown
