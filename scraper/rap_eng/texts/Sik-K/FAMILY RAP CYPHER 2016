[Verse 1: KSI]
They hear me ride when I come through (come through)
Every single time when I'm on cue
I'm putting I'm plotting no stopping this viral bee
Buzzing they copping the EP and tees
Slinging the birds out my whip
Angry birds, fly out to LA and shit
I see the tricks, Overwatch like I'm 76
I do not miss when I aim to get lit
Now that the kids wanna be me
Men wanna be me, chicks wanna do me
I'm making movies, best seller moving on to best teller
Brought out the penn for the fool, lemme take ya to school
Independent you niggas so dependent
Tweeting me I don't deserve it man I so offended
Allahhhhhh, removed by the flight attendant

[Verse 2: Deji]
My name is Deji
Don't forget my name
D E J I, That is how you spell my name
I have an I in my name, and and E too
They are both vowels, damn straight boo

[Verse 3: Yinka]
You want this pussy? You can't have it nigga
Your penis this? Well I like it bigger
My Poom Poom clean, I flick it flick it
I spit that fire, nails like wolverine
My bottom fat, you can't handle this
I'll twerk on dat, then I'll twerk on this
Ma foyche, if you hit on this
My jollof and eba is good, you are dismissed

[Verse 4: Jide]
You want her pussy? You can't have it nigga
Your penis this? Well I'm so much bigger
I'm African, yes I like big butts
I made your channel, go and suck these nuts

[Outro: Jide & KSI]
Ha ha ha ha, yes dad!
Shut up! You are a mistake!
