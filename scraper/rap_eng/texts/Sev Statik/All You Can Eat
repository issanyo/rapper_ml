[Verse 1: Manchild]
Flipping them burgers man, I'm so dang jive
Fries on the front, back, middle, and side
Supersize but I comb red hair dye
Coordination stunted when my glands go bye
Stepping off the wagon cause the man's on fire
Can't eat it all but I sure can try
Buckle up tomorrow with a new pants size
More manCHILD to love the fans cry
Don't matter much cause I bust so hard
Ain't met another who can touch so far
Spit kick, double up, yelling "Oh Lord"
Big as I can get I'll still fit in your car
Rhymes still kicking with my stomach all full
Fred B told me I can run in all wool
Two sides served with a ton of y'all bull
Ain't a card left that a brother won't pull

[Hook]
What y'all want you can have it, all you gotta do is go grab it
All you can eat feed the habit, anything you want you can have it
Come on

[Verse 2: Sintax]
Yo it's all you can wear just to cover what's bare naked
How many pair does it take of Jordan Air
To get you off the ground cause we're looking for a high top
Faded off the top rated popular style
Cinching the belt buckle braided through loops, aided
Look on your face makes it look like you ate it
Gorging yourself on a dinner plated
Masqueraded inside the clothes that you hated all the while
It's never the extremes, it's always in the middle
When you think you know a lot you know a little
Cause balance in our life it's the midwife of virtue
And what you indulge always hurts you

[Verse 3: Fred B]
Too many rhymes buddy, not enough beats
Too many days still not enough sleep
Too many Emcees not enough mics
Nor lights on the stage for the raves that I write
Indulge in a second helping without yelping
Filling up the void with this noise that I'm belting
Loosen up the pants just to make more room
Even Alka-Seltzer's fizz couldn't freaking consume
This bile that I shovel in, hours at end
It's like I can't breathe without my pad or my pen
This curse I bear going to make me lose my hair
Depression takes a toll but I got no fare
Lord, why do I care? I'm feeling ill-prepared
Yet the skills compare to no-one else out there
Needing guidance in borderline resulting in violence
Keep looping up my drums that's my lifes assignment

[Bridge: Sintax]
We love things that would fight to die
We love things that would like to kill
Our love for the higher things
Your love, Lord inspires dreams

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Sev Statik]
Yo looked at all these open nights throwing up fights
It's daytime if you got a son stuck to mics
We one life short, when we chalk up the walk
They down to give us a pound but don't stop the talk
Matter of fact, I like that
Say something when you got something to say to fight back
And not just put these words together to add the convo
No, don't just show what you might know
In a hurry but you wasn't called here
Chill for a minute let us all get more air
But thanks for the sweet thought though
The time to be harsh is now pronto
Put a sock in it, unless you like to taste the dirty toes
All up in your grill, you can kill with those
Hold up wait a minute, no need to try and finish
I get your point clearly, no need to get near me

[Hook]
