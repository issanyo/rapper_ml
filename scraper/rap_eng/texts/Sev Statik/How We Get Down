[Intro: Macho]
Yeah this presentation is brought to you by the Tunnel Rat family
Ain't no other emcees all over the world
New York, Atlanta, Boston, California
Man and woman, boy or girl
Put your hands up, everybody
Put your hands up

[Verse 1: Macho]
In twenty years, press rewind and my lyrics are legacy left behind
Won't remember my face but remember my rhyme
Out my heart, my mouth speaks, I pray speech will enthuse you
I usurp an intelligence so words never lose you still
Close attention and I mention your thoughts
Midway through parables, you find yourself caught up in the rapture
Trap your heads with words said
Now that I struck a chord, I'll tell you how the Lord bled
Blood red until the very last drop shed
Left for dead until the day we resurrected
But still neglected at mic checks 'cross the globe
From the tunnel we emerge a new breed whiter than snow
With the flow, people get excited at shows
That realize the reason for my hype ain't dough
You can scratch off the list clothes, flows, and hoes
Cause even hip-hop ain't got the power to save souls

[Hook: Macho]
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
Ain't no comparing when it comes to rocking shows
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
It's so apparent, my people already know

[Verse 2: Propaganda]
You could bring your tightest rapper
Resurrect the whole earth
But face it, no solar system found can embrace it
Look into the eyes of the tight rhyme facility
Represent his presence and never a facsimile
Better yet my similes knocking out Philistines
Silly you ain't feeling, we quit playing it cool
Skip heat rocks across the record pool
My crew, let it be known the Rats left your microphone blown

[Verse 3: Reconcile]
Passionate activists, we advocates of truth
Accurately aiming above average
Just to activate the youth in actuality
Actions are far from simply asked beyond the [?] of fiction
We bringin' the facts
Don't get mad at me rapping B
Just imagine me rapidly detaching this spirit
From these wack emcees speaking blasphemy
It has to be done with excellence
That's why we sick with the steel
Mass reality, we stick to the real

[Verse 4: Griffin]
Keep a tight rein on your tongue, you brothers are dumb
Prone to wack line reciting but believe that we come
To make an appeal that many really ain't gonna feel
And probably kill behind the scene when gossip is real
I had it but still I bring it like an addict on pills
Breaking cold sweats until my mind has had a good fill
I'm rapping to build with no one but the cats who are ill
Blow your mind said with nothing but grammatical skills, sucka!

[Hook: Macho]
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
Ain't no comparing when it comes to rocking shows
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
It's so apparent, my people already know

[Verse 5: Elsie]
It's spelled E-L-S-I-E
You can try and define me, don't step to me blindly
At 5'3" I be the one you can't miss
The one spitting the hits with the crew that never quits
We gets to the bottom of the hole to emerge and explode
In a whole new terra, little to no error
Tell me who could do it better than these Rats?
From the east to the west, we were born clever

[Verse 6: Sev Statik]
So I keep stepping on, keep repping strong
With the second chance I was given, I'm living for the Lord
Oh my, I reside on beats and breaks
I never flake, I'm a [?] in this life of high stakes
I'm strictly out for perfection, no need to impress the globe
You might forget the name but the heart is well known
Sowing a new seed with my hands to the plow
Like windows in a storm, my orders are shut down

[Hook: Macho]
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
Ain't no comparing when it comes to rocking shows
We command respect, others demand eject
When it comes to comparing the flow
But we ain't even going to get down to how we get down
It's so apparent, my people already know

[Outro: Reconcile]
What's happening? This is Reconcile from Mass Reality
Just showing some love
Basically this is uh... the Underground Rise album
Nothing but the illest, you know what I'm saying?
From the underground, just really putting it down
Coming out, helping people to see what this whole thing is really about, you know what I'm saying?
