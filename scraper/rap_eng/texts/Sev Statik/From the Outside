[Freddie Bruno]
From the outside, certified, gold and classic
Deepspace 5, the art of boombastic
Soon as my man passed it, Fred came to smash it
Blast it until your shell becomes cracked, it's
Massive, passive, gross attractive
Freddie burns the beat like lactic acid
Fantastic, wild out, feeling spastic
Let the outside reflect the inside and flash it

[ManCHILD]
Can't pass at all, we stop traffic
Live and on plastic, drive a strong passion
Mine, we on past the night to dawn after
Deepspace 5, we born to form classics

[Sev Statik]
There's a war going on inside
No soul is safe, nowhere to hide
You could put your hands up, doesn't matter how high son
You ain't got one prayer you could buy one

[Playdough]
Close your credit and fade to black
Got a bible in the back with the gangsta rap
With a big, gold plaque, yo thanks for that
Full tank full bank what you think of that?
It don't mean no thing in the hill of beans
At the end of the day we just human beings
So dirty but I brush my teeth with chlorine
Why you think my rap is so clean?

[Hook]
We may seem happy, like everything's alright
From the outside looking in, everything's uptight

[Sivion]
Check out my crew, we so hollywood
Love what we do cuz hip hop is good
It's understood when we roll through your hood
Make it do what it do when your bro never could
I think you should hang up the plastic
Metal mesh, 58, sour like Vlasic
Might sound better after some practice
Sev and the crew make a brother fantastic

[Listener]
I work the field with two hands
I move the dirt with my back
I wash it clean with the sweat
Let if grow from the ground, go help the rest
I move the wind with my wings
I fill the depths of the sea
I dig my roots in the water
Hold the ground steady for your dragons and daughters

[Playdough]
Roses are red and violets for certain
The inside working speaking third person
The precursor, universal networking
The outside lurking inside my church

[Sintax]
Put your wingtip right on my lip, I spit shine
Shoestring tight grip, polish your mind
Buff that rhyme out, wax so poetic
Sintax.the.Terrific paint a black aesthetic
On the outside, hoping that the ink sinks in
My custom kiwi leather bottle leaking
See me bombing something divine
When I spit it on out I make the inside shine

[Fred B]
So turn it up, baby
Bang out your trunk, baby
Shout who you are from the moon to the stars, baby
Forget the rest, baby
Give it your best, baby
Loving yourself is the wealth and the test, baby

[Hook]

[Sev Statik]
Get your hands off the glass
This ain't nothing to look at, better off to pass
Know that
Never said a word
But you got that look like you concerned
For that
I might say something that you ain't going to like
Most likely so, but it's alright
It's a little too hot for us all to fight
You picked the right MC, but the wrong mic

[Sivion]
I'll take it back and then give it
Pour out the soul, the globe and then rip it
Look at the hourglass, the shapes shifting
Form of the deepest space for soul lifting

[Sintax]
Flesh on the outside, spirit on the inside
Pressed to the image of God come alive
Fresh on the outside, fierce on the inside
That's the definition of Deepspace 5

[ManCHILD]
You might think, me and the band are big time and kickin' it
On time definitive, one grind, delivering
Black balls to any celler dwellers and fellas that want to get down
Rocksteady tell them to sit down
You might think that this town is big enough
To fit inside a little bit of triple crown style
And big brown, here we developing hits now
But every cat said in my big mouth it gets out

[Listener]
When I get to heaven, I'll ask God to send me back
Into my home is blind and broken help us get on track
Armor on the outside, golden wings spread out wide
I'll shelter all my brothers, sisters let them come inside
Oh come inside, come inside
