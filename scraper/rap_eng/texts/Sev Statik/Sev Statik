[Intro: Sev Statik]
Cause I'm sick of it
This business, heh
We just gonna do it ourselves
Now what? And I hope you don't like it

[Verse 1: Sev Statik]
Sev Statik, a tunnel rat for the cause, not the applause
I'm doing world tours on a poor man's plan
Because I'm called to deliver word po ballistics
Stick with your own kind when it comes to the mind
It's a sad, sad situation for the movement to change the world
But pocket of hip-hop is vacant
I abort those who think they support my [vinese??]
Hip-hop fashion slash political magazines
And these DJs who merely gyrate what's hot for now
[?] free wax from the same heads in the underground who doubt
I see it down here too
Just a few posses and cliques involved in politics
Some even sound tight, fresh on the mic
They got us all tricked
The double-crossed, slapped twice with a crucifix
I agree sending out promos is one way to go
Just show me some love like my name was by a beat though
This joint is for those who press and promote they own product
About five bucks a play
It's eight bucks for the tape, a few more for the CD
Full effort EP released independently, yeah

[Hook: Elsie]
Carry the torch on stages for the true emcees
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
You know the name though he play the game independently
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
No dotted lines or dollar signs could change his mind
He's (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
Been sworn to rep the art in its truest form
(Sev Statik, from the live [?])

[Verse 2: Sev Statik]
So what you mean, man?
You want my vinyl and cassette for free?
For this I bleed burgundy but y'all knuckles think you agree
That's pitiful dawg, sound like I'm getting ripped off
Cough up the shipping and handling, stop panhandling
That's an extra cost, y'all often overlook
So keep a mind before you ask for mine
But I hope you come up out your pocket with that request
Unless rejection is something you wanna digest
Invest back into hip-hop, that's the way you should be
Rep for these DJs worldwide
And we emcees who stayed up late at night
Developing verbal techniques on mics with Spiderman vision
Focusing on websites to get the word out
Without waiting for a release date
Stumping bootleggers they stay killing my tape
Cause I receive e-mails every day that could say
"Can I get a promo wax? I'm a DJ. I make mixtapes"
"I got a radio show. I'll put you in rotation on my station
It'll give you daps in my location"
Yeah, whatever man

[Hook: Elsie]
Carry the torch on stages for the true emcees
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
You know the name though he play the game independently
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
No dotted lines or dollar signs could change his mind
He's (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
Been sworn to rep the art in its truest form
(Sev Statik, from the live [?])

[Verse 3: Sev Statik]
I wanna hear some gems drops before conscious raps, no catch
No strings attached, no dance acts
Unless these cats is uprocking with Adidas
Feed us truth, no lies over breaks
Jazz loops and dope lines
A disciple of Christ, blessin' mics worldwide
I spit a blessed text to keep you rest so I can baptize a enterprise
While you compromise the integrity of hip-hop
Listen, my audience is built in
Underground from the ground down, beat scavengers
Mic grabbers, breakers and pain rappers
My man Dirty Dert, he knows what it means to be fresh
Don't gotta get the dough right, just get the mic check
One two, suffer for my art, suffer for my faith
I'm here to minister, not to entertain
So take your soft-porn videos and rap songs
And get to get sucker, be gone

[Hook: Elsie]
Carry the torch on stages for the true emcees
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
You know the name though he play the game independently
They call him (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
No dotted lines or dollar signs could change his mind
He's (Sev Statik, from the live [?])
Been sworn to rep the art in its truest form
(Sev Statik, from the live [?])
