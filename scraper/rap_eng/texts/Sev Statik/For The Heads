[Intro]
Feel that? Feel that
I can definitely deal wit' it
Set this off, Raph!
Check, it goes down like this

[Verse 1: Raphi]
Some days you just feel like rockin' the mic
For the sake of makin' sure you still sound tight
It's only right until you get your stripes
And look who flew in on the red eye flight!
Another tunnel rat who came to move the town tonight (get down)
Unite, you see we the type to fight for the one who can't
Just know that we thorough from the intro to the bed
To me it's gotta be if you gon' see the TR stance
So now that I have your attention, let
Let me show you how I do this, I deserve my rep
And I bet by the time this rhyme's through, you'll like this crew
This on some old great mic control
Strollin' over the beat that got freakin' to techniques
And the MP complete for the b-boys buggin' in the street
Break your body, take it to the next lev
We rep boom bap, talk about 'em Sev

[Verse 2: Sev Statik]
They tryin' to think on and how I rock mics
Play my CD out 'til it burned out your laser light
Consistent spins, listening to the vision
It's a body of work but you only heard one limb
So then you feel you're the one to review
My supernatural spew for this website you do (no)
Don't you understand what weight that holds?
Better hold off with your pre-mature thoughts (thoughts)
Before you mold any prison of opinion
Y'all missing what I'm giving somewhere in the transmission
If you just (just) listen one time thoroughly through
You might just hear who I'm speakin' to
Or what I'm talking about, no stutters or slurs
Everything crystal clear but your words don't confirm
What the message is or who I'm tryin' to reach
Miss my whole point but still you feel you must speak

[Hook]
So this one goes out to those
Who'd rather hear flows when they go to the shows
Instead of these hoes yap about clothes
Or the big ballin' bros with they watch and they Rolls

This one goes out to those
Who'd rather hear flows when they go to the shows
Instead of these hoes yap about clothes
Or the big ballin' bros with they watch and they Rolls

[Verse 3: Raphi]
TR we are outright the best writers
Of a team you ever heard or seen
Words are delivered from the source of all things
So often I bring what y'all been missing in 360 rings
It's supernatural the way that we natural on mics
Like we actually believe in what we speak
Wack emcees be aware we come to share
About the comin' o' Christ so you must come prepared

[Verse 4: Sev Statik]
I swear millionaires in Bel Air don't care
About those of us tryin' to scrape up bus fare
What it's like on the block they forgot
I can't bear to watch, now hip-hop's poppin'
We rock for the real heads, not a soda spot
But known to talk off the top for the fans
Who stand true to sides of the lands
Few can come through, for who?
Homies on the avenue

[Hook]
So this one goes out to those
