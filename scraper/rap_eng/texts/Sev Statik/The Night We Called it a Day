[Verse 1: manCHILD]
When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch sight of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow drawl into a strong voice of reason
Stand in the snow thinking of summer
Just longing for another season
Belong in no particular region, but here I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my family's far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
Or this morning or this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I sure remember tomorrow just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, cuz I can't afford the hell to pay
Want to blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
Want to fix your phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear God I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you held me to your heart through all the times I fell away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to captive crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empire to the ground...

[Verse 2: Listener]
Ya, amazingly, the Cask of Amontillado
Cracks wide open to vibrate your bravado
Sewn up escape, body-bagging, like I'm the Count of Monte Cristo
World Tour, DL, Coffee shopping, and we're coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms like I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, because I know you're feeling me
Listener, rapper, potpourri of Life- all synonyms to Cornucopia
I'm so glad you have a wife- In this wolf eat salmon world
You better grab swords and sell your knives or
You'll get chopped by the needle when it spins over to my rhymes yo
Rap music guys and self-titled artists alike
Please think twice before you say your things on the microphone
I might not be, but I take it seriously
When you really listen to the words, and you're not just hearing me

[Hook]
Day and Night
Wrong or Right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mic
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

[Verse 3: Playdough]
Working it out (out), placing my feet to concrete
Hitting the street with a vengeance, stench is so sweet
But bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probably the reason that I'm breezing through class
So steadfast we pushed to find the bush that was burning
Staying determined and yearning because the lessons we learning are life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase and transpose all these average joes with weak flows
Who knows not the true and living rose who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feeling all right, color at night's
Being blocked by the shocking array that we play in light
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The ones speaking absurd are finally heeding my word (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That'd be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

[Verse 4: Sev Statik]
I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down to form seas
An ocean of possibilities to dwell in
Yelling at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the dawn of time
Watch the sunrise in both my daughter's eyes
Permanent shine, find my reflection inside
Living to die, dying to live, and all glory given back to God

[Verse 5: Freddie Bruno]
It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to dust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm digging in my brain so I could rip the instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count with 16 to go
The writer's blocks are stepping stones towards the metronome
Erasing deadlines with headlines placed on my poem
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shaken but not stirred, deterred from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I wanna handcuff the hands of time
No grace period allotted for here's the sunshine

[Hook]

[Verse 6: Sintax.The.Terrific]
Bet I'm casting nets to dredge
The deep blue ways of wet
God's silhouette on watered palettes painted pink by suns and set
Burnt from a long day's work, but feeling fine
Tip its cap and pat the moon upon its back as day declines
Candlelight switch as you slip into the evening
And curtsy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Walk a tightrope for gravity keep lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Sintax, the melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mic device 'cuz I get nice plus keep a conscious
Hence I split the tense, mince words like sentence fragments
Moon Dust the bus 'cuz I ain't in it for the cabbage
The incandescent crescent spits His omnipresent flame
But my fame will flicker out my name's Sintax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black burned bright the night He called it a Day...

[Verse 7]

[ManCHILD]
Shadows step for the One, unearthing every tongue, run
Underneath the cover of the night time sun
Lungs broken and scraped, spoken on shattered breaks
Pierce the black hole soul with my faith as I take

[Sev Statik]
Break Minutes back from father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

[Freddie Bruno]
Feeling threatened as they sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your auditory where the Listener would stick it

[Listener]
Fix it with skill when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

[Sintax.The.Terrific]
Sun raised by your score with notes my surfacing's
Grey matter meteor urban core for Elohim

[Playdough]
And when the sun sets some one lets the mic down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it tied down
But not before we retire the pen
Knowing tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

[Sev Statik]
Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word
Deepspace 5: sent to serve
We travel in the sands of the lost and we understand
We battle with the possible chance you take the cross
On your block, in your speakers dues is paid
We out for a change, in The Night We Called it a Day...
