[Hook: LMNO]
All those red tops, evil thoughts
People shot playing out the plot
(Kick, kick, kick kick)
Prejudice seeds of lust
Raise in the garden of dust
Ayo we must (kick, kick, kick kick)
The door down with the Lion of Judah taking your crown
We're Zion bound (kick, kick, kick kick)
Back before you react, get all the facts
Know it's God's people, we're under attack
(Kick, kick, kick kick)
Every order, every sort of division
Dismissing man's laws with Jah's permission
(Kick, kick, kick kick)
A rap to heal the hurt, insert this love
Our hip-hop stays alert
(Kick, kick, kick kick)

[Verse 1: Dax]
Whatever happened to it, it seems the time passing quicker
Flame of the truth is only a flicker
And the heart is thinner, starving the beginner
While the population is thicker, it's hard to find a winner
The game is eating up they names so they identified
As someone who resembles what it used to be like
But now they bitter
Swinging for the stars with the weight of the world on they shoulders
Just call 'em a heavy hitter
Living in the litter, looked upon as a trash picker
Only cause they ducked on by everyone who doesn't fit the mold
Defined by wrecking soul instead of a road
They travel just to get the picture
Well I'ma change that, been called to it
Rearrange that, I'ma stay that real rapper, real cat
Dax, remember the name, the first Tunnel Rat
Coming for it and I'm taking it back

[Verse 2: Knows]
Well I'm knowing since this going down
Growing up's an obstacle to stop what being optical illusions
Since I'm moving every millisecond when we wreck the treachery
A secondary lesser me would be worse when our destiny is first
In line, in mind body spirit with the lyrics
Fearing one individual because when I speak you hear it
Steering good fortune in a way I can feel it
About to clear it in among us with a lowless kick kick

[Verse 3: Zane One]
Right foot in 'tween high
Contact with a mean old habit
Beat it to a pulp, indescribable damage
Round house to the brain
Cop a [?], heads need to be helmeted
When the boom kicks, vocalizing bliss
Pick up mics for a quick fix to get my licks
A lit box of champa can't disguise the scent of burning flesh
And I don't want no Dalai Lama dying for peace and for honor
Telling me to serve him 'til my last breath

[Verse 4: Dezin8ed]
And now what'll you put up with, huh?
What will you put down?
Cause I put it in 'til it puts out
And I gots to put my foot down on this hokey-pokey
Okey-doke no joke, handing out promos to heads who don't go
To no shows, tell the truth behind my back and then lie in person
And then tell me to pay no attention to that man behind the curtain
But we gon' see you, you ain't fooling no one in here
And you'll see when Tunnel Rats burrow a hole in your ear

[Verse 5: Sev Statik]
And you swear you know what rap is
Try and act like black kids
You act the false side of life [?] Fatlip
So instead of something you, you gave a second hand
You think you ripping the mics but you ripping off your fans
I took your red planet and blew it out the system
Say you met God but it sounds like you missed Him
So keep flapping your wings while I soar under grace
Sev Statik's right here bruh, bring it to my face
