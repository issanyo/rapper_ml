[Intro: Dax]
I feel like David must've felt standing before Goliath
But it's 2001, check it out

[Verse 1: Dax]
I pull a pistol out my pocket and I cocked it
Back and aimed it at your eye sockets
Y'all can watch us rock it
Ain't no future tryna block it, you ain't gon' stop it
I held it 'til it got too hot and had to drop it
Gave y'all a chance to enhance the game
Left you five years ago and y'all still sound the same
Sitting hearing you complain how you're money ain't right
How you can't find a decent deal but how you died on the mic
Gospel rap don't give you fame, you ain't gon' get rich
Try the world and couldn't hang, you figured you'd switch
But God ain't gon' bless that, hear what I'm sayin'
You should've learned from the [?], you thought I was playin'
While y'all was hip-hop or prayin', we were digging in crates
Perfectin' the art of rap while Dert perfected the breaks
Life's a game of give or take, I couldn't choose to be wack
God gave y'all a chance and told us to take it back

[Verse 2: Raphi]
Ay, we start lokin' up when the mic open up
Soaking up rays of LA summer days
A mic master, party crasher in your sector
Check the level quick, turn the bass down, I got resonance
I'm in your residence, so call me the ruler
Man, I got all the right measurements to school ya
Type to see right through ya
Tell me do you even know yourself
If so probably not well, see folks I can tell
Would you steal and kill from those who will prevail
With abilities to hit the hammer on the nail
And still hopefully not get derailed
Without a face or spine, don't waste my time

[Hook: Macho?]
Y'all know the name, it's all the same
The Rats have been gone, still on top of the game
Still at the after-party watching the people move they body
Reminiscing on days of La-Di-Da-Di
Y'all do the talkin', we'll do the walkin'
If you lay in the rubble of the bombs that we droppin'
Nah, they ain't gon' stop it, we movin'
Club and the cruising
The TRz are the crews the people choosin'

[Verse 3: Elsie]
Yo they never listen to that, never learn
We bring the rain but they prefer to get burned
So let's raise the heat 'stead of blaze the concrete
Keep them banging their heads just tryna stay on their feet
'Til the night turns to day or music won't play
Or voice gives way, 'cause Tunnel Rats will never fade
We came from the path, New Breed made to last
So y'all better learn and y'all better learn fast

[Verse 4: Sev Statik]
Pin y'all up against the wall, man don't move
Your crew is pancake and they can't
Rock instrumentals the way we do so stop the music
Speak life, dang right we paid our dues in abundance
We loving the way God gave us this whole game back
Never front, Tunnel Rats so watch for many things to change
Class is in session and we soon to call out names

[Verse 5: Macho]
Man, whether I'm blowing up stages, rocking on curbs
Bumpin' in your stereo till neighbors are disturbed
I'mma be found guilty of spreading the Word
Yo it's the uncut, uncensored unadulterated
Product of the power of Gospel, it's cuss-created
And though some will hate it, hate is too overrated
They hated Jesus even though He was true, true
They hate us cause we free the minds of the youth
In fact, they hate the Rats cause we tighten the noose
And left the wack crews hangin' while they fiend for the juice

[Refrain: Jurny Big??]
T.R.'z we are those who set the bar
Higher, retire if you not up to par
We've come much too far to change who we are
While y'all shapeshift and facelift and still can't make it

T.R.'z we are those who set the bar
Higher, retire if you not up to par
We've come much too far to change who we are
While y'all shapeshift and facelift and still can't make it

[Verse 6: Zane One]
It is madness
When I see that punks be killing what we work so very hard for
Got your world spun off its axis
But we taking too long, now I can't ignore
All the junk that you spoke, you're hanging by your own rope
Knotted by the twisted ties of lies you wish and you hope
We wouldn't come back this hard, believe it's hard to come back
If not us, then who will be the crew you attack?
Rookies!

[Verse 7: Jurny Big]
I split the sky and deep sand with my slang blarin'
Spread life on barren page cause it's blatantly apparent
In a messed up industry where most concerned with looks
We center laced a message invested in rap books, hooks
I never fade since I left eleventh grade
My pens and pad been laid and my bed's been made
Stayed with it though sometimes the question exit slips
But it's not loud enough to make the record skip
So don't trip

[Hook: Macho?]
Y'all know the name, it's all the same
The Rats have been gone, still on top of the game
Still at the after-party watching the people move they body
Reminiscing on days of La-Di-Da-Di
Y'all do the talkin', we'll do the walkin'
If you lay in the rubble of the bombs that we droppin'
Nah, they ain't gon' stop it, we movin'
