[Intro]
This is the case of State versus Deepspace 5
The defense can call its first witness

Please state your name for the court

[Verse 1: Fred B]
Freddie hot-hands, lend me your ear and I can tell you Sev's gameplan
Homie was off, said Dust was cutting him short
On the *Back to Dust* record I would like to report
It's the god's honest, doggonest truth I tell ya'
Started looking through his records talking Helter Skelter
Had a look in his eye like he wanna try
With a head full of lies he heard from Rabbi
Then he dropped the verse how he padded the purse
Dust tried to explain then he had to reverse
With the statement from Paypal to validate
Plus in the ashes of the rubble is a file from Nate

Please state your name for the court

[Verse 2: Sev Statik]
Sev Statik the point man I'm always on course
Come on kid, how was it me?
Stuffing in my notebook with thousands of beats
Drowning in freestyle, meanwhile I feel some heat
Ain't nothing strange; I knew it was me
Because my pen holds lava, to spit harder
To spit hotter, it's getting darker
Smoke filled rooms, it's not me
Choking out, get on the floor, move towards the door
Run out the back, manCHILD with a little bit of talk to hand
Because I figure he did it, uh-huh

Please state your name for the court

[Verse 3: Manchild]
ManCHILD, I was sleeping on the sofa when the fire ran wild
But the phone rang waking a copy of Slow Flame
I was sorta blacked out but I saw the whole thing
Figure with the itchy trigger finger to shoot
Like flicker, bigger, sticker to the biggest of the crews
He was like, diesel what's a wigger to do?
Next thing I know I'm speaking to the evening news
It spread so fast, I'll leave it to you
On some scientific theories that you leading them through
Found butterfly wings all over the crime scene
Man, Sivion did it, believe it son, I'm clean

Please spit your game for the court

[Verse 4: Sivion]
It's Sivion, bomb on the mic when I write, make a million
What's really on, is what's really gone crazy
Dust's crib burned and they blame me
But I got no shame cause I saw the whole thing
If you know the style you can figure out the name
It will make you go dang
If you do the math you would probably do the same
We got hungry from the raps
Sev put the chicken patties on the grill in the back
The deck caught flame from every stub angle
You saw the chubb prints so talk to Doug Dangle

Please state your name for the court

[Verse 5: Playdough]
Come on man, you heard the flow, you know who I am
Gosh dangit dang I'm so innocent
I've been framed by unmagnificent
Kiddy size, small young on their uniform
Flowers, my little ponies and unicorns
The truth is everybody there saw
Ozark Empire strike back, Arkansas
The hillbilly himself was burning a bite
Drop a spark on the carpet and all ignite
We all ran but we didn't know it all combust
Listener better listen up and talk to Dust

Please state your name for the court

[Verse 6: Listener]
Dan Smith, good citizen of life and I solemnly swear
To not tell a lie while I sit in this chair
It was all dark, drove up on the scooter
Our 5 foots stricken, past a string of looters
Stuff from Nate's house hanging from the arms
And pieces of Nate's house burning on the lawn
I see Nate; arms to the sky, on his knees
And I look out back see a figure in the trees
It was an ugly Sasquatch Phantom of the Opera
(You want the truth? You can't handle the truth!)
It's colonel Bruno in the studio with a candelabra

[Bridge]
Mister foreman, do you have a verdict? 25 to life each one of them burned it
Mister foreman, do you have a verdict? 25 to life each one of the deserved it

[Verse 7: Sintax.the.Terrific]
May it please the court, I'm counsel for the defendants
There has been a travesty of justice in this sentence
No genuine issue of material fact presented
From which a jury of their peers could be convinced
That beyond a reasonable doubt these six men did it
I'd like to reserve rebuttal time after my colleague's finished
You see your honor, on the night in question
They could not have done it they were jacked on epinephrine
And Dust he saw it all, but I firmly believe
That that his testimony should be suppressed: fruit of the poisonous tree
And your honor, if I'm really being honest
There has been a violation of substantive due process
Of Roe v. Wade and Lawrence vs. Texas
And the forum state lacks a thoroughly sufficient nexus
To keep these men, did I fail to mention
That the jurors suffered from a general lack of attention
Or really any good sense, I think one was blind
And the alternates shot dice and partied all the time
And the State's main witness was John Caliglio
And everyone in lock-up knows that he's a snitch, yo
This verdict is void ab initio
Res ipsa loquitur, and x post facto
[?] ultra vires ex facie
Quid pro quo plus I think it has rabies
We need a change of forum and venue
Toilet paper, plus the lockup needs a menu
He's starved clients behind bars
And I'd like to file a motion to have your honor disbarred
Or at least recused, institute sanctions
For your contempt and multiple violations
Assault, battery, malicious prosecution
Bad breath, libel, slander, prostitution
Loss of consortium, clients can't survive
Since the ruling they haven't had any sex with their wives
This is a breach of your fiduciary duties
Only recourse is sell our story to the movies
Get paid millions, give it to the children
Do it all over again to beat the system
