[Hook: DJ Dust]
Take the rhythm

[Verse 1]
[ManCHILD]
I like to keep her in my pocket when the fans watch
But I'm the one to pull her pigtails when we play out in the sandbox
And hands stop clapping when manCHILD's plans not to
Rock upon the rhythm when he rocks you
My shock values electrify and light your darkest secrets
Ride the beat, I'll walk beside it on foot if that's the way I feel it
And if that's the way I feel it, there's no chance that you'll convince me
Off the beaten path of substance plus you left the rhythm empty

[Freddie Bruno]
I excel on spreadsheets to freak the journalistic
Captivate the rhythm and ride with my linguistics
Performing with the loops let the sentence bring drama
Benihana avenger with the heart of shaman
A title God sound, astound the freedom fighter
I stay behind the scenes like medical underwriters
Highlight a parable grammar fluorescent to see
Split your brain up in sections as a lesson for three

[Playdough]
I state fact and playback to rate wack take back
Rhythm like an Indian giver, deliver inside of this metronome
Where poem hits doing splits
Inside my spirit where my vocal transmits
Rhythm's key so I'm setting her free, ninety degree
Pushing clockwise, keeping it quantized and off-wise
Over the beat we meet in deepspace
Place rhythm in the palm of my hand as contraband

[Listener]
Now, we are rappers rhyming rap-style rhymes
With our DJ's tracking beats to crack spines
With some blatant accusations pointed straight for your crew
Then you stutter to defend you are real, oh are you?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[Playdough]
Hey there rhythm, it's me again, tell me, how you been?
I guess the middleman could be this pen
I use to talk to and walk through they chalk you
Traced around your silhouette cause how ill it get
But watch the intellect resurrect, check God's purpose
Give me a hat confirming that you truly heard this
Yeah, there you go, I show improve just to move
Make the rocky path smooth while I'm taking back the groove

[ManCHILD]
Yo, yeah, yeah, yeah admittedly I'm jaded
But please don't blame it on my freestyle or my content or my cadence
Or my blatant disregard of the rhythm slash the drum sound
It's just the fact that I got a lot to say and it can't be dumbed down
I told you that I'm unsound, so deep I make the young drown
Dumbfound with one noun with Fred B and Harry Krum now
Unbound, I stand at the foot of the cross they intersected
Yo, I'll take the rhythm any way that I can get it

[Freddie Bruno]
I bring the PowerPoint while your Microsoft attempts
Are just some weak demonstrations that are over the fence
Your train of thought dissipates like smoke from incense
I'm doing wind sprints, using my voice as testamints
With the golden folklore onlookers would hope for
Prolific, Ziontific phonetic composer
Revise your whole score, write it out on dirt floor
Put the rhythm in my soul til it secretes my pore

[Sintax]
I've got a crown of white wisdom hidden below my ballcap
I'm pencil fight fencing just to take the rhythm back
But if emceeing is believing then Sintax just left you doubtless
Syncopated the rhythm to the pulse of God's verse

[Sev Statik]
And I'll take the reflection of music and use it to inspire men
Comply with the laws of physics and send this written around the globe
For those beings who live to be free
No holds barred, transform the sun, moon and stars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[Freddie Bruno]
Letters walk parallel with tracks and spit on
On the threshold of stress, push through with stiff arm
Maneuver the pen in slow motion on the canvas
Your raps ain't fat, the populous is still famished

[Playdough]
I'm hearing pleas from the treetops present in the beatbox
Sober like a detox room
I come to consume the volume take the rhythm as boon
Odiferous with the fume in full bloom, I assume

[ManCHILD]
Tie a ribbon around the rhythm; earmark it for the future
MC's lost their motivation like house pets are spayed and neutered
Play the tutor, make the most, stay the course, make decisions
Wake the sleeping, take a chance, shake the world, take the rhythm

[Sev Statik]
Many words of faith placed inside blew my prison bars
Divine intervention to easily discard
Fake knuckas perpetrating on wax, CD's, and tapes
So I take the rhythm to a new place and mold a new shape

[Hook]
