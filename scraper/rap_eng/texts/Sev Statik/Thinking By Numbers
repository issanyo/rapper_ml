[Hook 1]
It goes one for the money and two for the time
Three for mortal man and four for divine
Five for the rhyme and six for the reason
And seven's for the number that signifies completion

[Post-Hook]
One for the pleasure and two for the pain
Three for the struggle and four for the strain
Five for deepspace and six for something to believe in
And seven's for the number that signifies completion

[Verse 1: manCHILD]
Lights, camera, activate. Activists on picket lines
Masochists are killing time, we're passionate and spilling rhymes
Filling minds with a plan so elaborate
Let's infiltrate this whole charade and undermine the establishment
Grab your seat belt, fasten it, they fascinate the inhabitants
Pump us full of information that they know to be inaccurate
They got a moral detachment habit, so turn your back on graphic violence static
Support this positive movement through music or you're stagnant
(Nah, he's only joking). Yeah, but it's not far from the truth
In fact, it lives two doors down, right there in apartment # 22
So many schools of thought have been bought or knocked off kilter
It only takes a platinum plaque or maybe thirty pieces of silver
So who killed the family? Let's blame it on the government!
It's the democrats, the republicans, whatever party's running it
Spit something that's heartfelt or emotionally sacred
Can't walk these streets naked cloaked in my happy-faced hatred
Realize the world around me is exactly what I make it
You've gotta face the music or this music leaves you faceless
You've gotta face the music or this music leaves you faceless
You've gotta face the music or this music leaves you faceless

[Hook 2]
It goes, one for the money and two for the time
Three for the deaf and four for the blind
Five for the rhyme and six for the reason
And seven's for the number that signifies completion

[Verse 2: Listener]
Now, first of all I can see from where I'm at the moat from which this castle grows
Secondly, the kings inside seem content and determined to drive their people far into the moat, just to see them float
I saw pain from life and relief by the knife gripped by white knuckles tight hiding deeds from the light
People walking with smiles and blades coming from their backs
Residents blindfolded with eyes painted on the front and tied tight in the back
Blank minds individually fulfilled with the iron fist columnist
Spitting chaff, trying to veil the hoard
Feelingless, making everyone a pacifist
Then there was crushing blows from all the self-titled nobles
Taking so much more than they're worth
Killing citizens as they throw them, using them
Last, it was the shocking melancholic acceptance that the sluggish
Majority applauded for, lived for, with their abusive leaders giving more
I turn my face to dry heave, turn my direction to leave

[Hook 3]
It goes one for the money and two for the time
Three for the bread and four for the wine
Five for the rhyme and six for the reason
And seven's for the number that signifies completion

[Post-Hook]

[Verse 3: Sev Statik]
Well, if my name wasn't Sev, I wouldn't know the cost of perfection
But I recall I was called to just give out these messages
Wetting kids with semi-automatic pen weapons
Send them back to the lab second-guessing or thinking on mathematical equations
Questions get asked
Should they pursue pen and pad infection with no cure?
I'm ill but pure, fulfill prescriptions
The Point Man is in, lessons served up for mental treatment
Seeking out souls like I'm a sage or capture one or two or three or more like forever
Ink is sprayed on pages of life
I'm contemplating on meeting knowledge to get in good with his wife
Wisdom seems like she got some things cooking
Looking real tight
A sight for sore eyes, so I'm only checking her at night time
Nah, don't trip, I speak on inspiration
It's poetry though, bro, it feels good to be creative
I'm writing numeric, with a chain reaction of wonder
I slumber over my notebook, when I'm thinking by numbers
