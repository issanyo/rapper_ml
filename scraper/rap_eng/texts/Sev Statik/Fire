[Hook]
It's like one for the trouble and two for the time
Three for the biddies and four for the dimes
Five for the crew that I rep so well
The one that keeps the wheels moving on your black Maxell

[Verse 1: Sivion]
I'm cold chillin' in the place to be
Playdough and Sean P standing next to me
Deepspace 5, keepin' it live
And we keep you all buzzin' like a beehive
Cuz see, I've been doin' this here long time
Always out to school I never fear y'alls' rhyme
Though I hear y'all whine, see we here on time
Cuz my DS posse be one of a kind

[Verse 2: sintax.the.terrific]
Stickum, ha, ha, ha stick 'em
True school style, me and old time religion
Me and my crew demand some decision
Either you're for us or you're 'bout to go missin' in
All points bulletin style on your flow
Deepspace 5 spittin' fire like pyro
Please admire my more flyer attire
Gun for hire, bro
Elevator music Ray Rice'm you whole retire so

[Verse 3: Freddie Bruno]
F-R-E double D I-E
And I rock microphones so beautifully
It's a good look, search no further than me
None fresher than we, Son bright as can be
Don't deny what you see when salvation is free
The SM58 resonate higher with heat
Want your head on my sword, a gold tip on my cord
Standing like the 300 in the face of your horde

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Playdough]
Check it out, you don't stop
Deepspace we got to be the sureshot
So check it out
You don't stop
You don't stop, stop, stop
Hey, let me go, check it
The P-L-A the Y-D-O
The U-G-H I'm def when I flow
The rockstar the Boxcar Willie on tracks
Stole a cop car crab scratch willies on wax
We mighta called it a day, but it's cuz we own the night
They trynna buy up our soul, but tell 'em we sold the right
We fight a real good fight with the gold on the tip
I kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug then I dip

[Verse 5: manCHILD]
Yo, my name is man Channing all over you Tatum
Speaking it verbatim, my per diem open
For spoken relation words ate 'em
Watch what they wanted, gave 'em triple that
Pitter patter me kicking facts
Running up on your simple raps
They call me funky cold Mecca with an
Eye on Jerusalem reppin' for something extra
Smooth with the texture
Deepspace forever
Here for Dougy dang dangerous plus your listening pleasure

[Verse 6: Sev Statik]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About how we pushing pens from way back when
It's like no stopping it, we up in your face
It's the vision for the few, so listen to Deepspace
You can't press record, ain't no dubbin' no more
You can rest assured, this is somethin' for breaks
Put 'em in the circles
Watch 'em square it up, tear it up
B-boys and girls, peace gonna flare it up

[Outro: Playdough]
"D" to the double "E" "P" space 5
Times 2, ten ways to fly when we stage dive
Live and direct and everybody's right here
So tag this on your soul and stick it down into your ear

Yo, "D" to the double "E" "P" space 5
Times 2, ten ways to fly with free stage dive
So, bring it over here, yeah that's the ticket
Lend us your ear and we'll show you where to stick iiiiiiiiiit
