[Verse 1]
[Playdough]
I swear, i care not what the man think
My plan: ink paper til drips with the fruit of my lips
Yet, if i get no dap or hand clap
From rap that i make, my tangible heart break

[manCHILD]
With my arms wide open, I hold opponents to my creed
An arrangement, shoplift the stolen moments that I need
Played stickball with my chances, broke the window
On a streetcar named desire parked next to the Chariots of Fire

[Listener]
Held down in this quagmire, tarnishing crowns as I perspire
Dwindling empires as I plug wires to transcribe my fire
Filling ears with my word lies
Wrapped tight to let you describe the feeling through your own eyes

[manCHILD]
They throw their souls up in the air cause that's the coin they like to toss
They want life without the loss, they want Christ without the cross
Pretty faces, empty insides grace the runway, or so some say
Gun play moves the crowd Sunday by bloody Sunday

[Sev Statik]
I don't bother writing flows about clothes and cars
Record sales are not a measure of how dope you are
And this knowledge is what separates us from them
I'd rather snuff the page and then beat it down with my pen

[Playdough]
Microphone testing, a blessing indeed, I stay
Pressing the seed hoping the hearts will receive in grounds fertile
A brown journal holding the picture, a mixture
Of heart plus emotion from my lyric to your spirit

[Hook] x2
This curse I bear, this curse I swear
Ya'll never notice the despair between the kick and the snare
I scream for you to wake up, but you just don't care
You sleeping on my speaking is my worst nightmare

[Verse 2]
[manCHILD]
Grit my teeth and close my eyes, still see the misery that kills men
I'll just take another step and draw the energy from my children
Until then, I'll just feel the pain and let you hurt me
Cry my tears in a bottle so you can drink it when you're thirsty

[Listener]
Inviting you to constantly listen and not just hear
To be here where I'm at would cause most people to not do this next year
For fear that nobody would listen and only sneer
Believing that your target audience wouldn't cheer
Makes you so anxious you just steer clear, well
Here's a tape and to my thoughts I hope you're near
To my concepts please adhere your mind and life
In a way that's the most advantageous for you to mirror

[Playdough]
Hey man, I got a snare and a verse where I'm bearing a curse
Got me wondering if smothering my kick to disperse
This high-hat, I'm setting it free, it got to be
The same night that I called it a day, what should I say

[Sev Statik]
I write massive amounts of rhymes
But the masses don't hear it, don't care about checking me out
I swear it be cursing my verses and the stages that I walk on
I guess my talk is to rich for these fools with jewels in my songs

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
[Listener]
Bound by the realization of what it is that I get up for
Cuz it's not the sun, not the day
I do it for fear that I'll lose my perception in the long run
Losing the contrast proverbially of the night to the day's bright sun

[Playdough]
A curse is squeezing a ill verse to a 4-bar purse
I couldn't spend or bend the rhyme pattern
Trying to represent with limited content
Then vent my feelings squeezed inside of these emcees

[manCHILD]
See, it's hard for me to hide the fact it's not interesting when I'm listening
Me and disappointment go together like cigarettes and nicotine
And when it seems my dreams collide with the name on my place card
I'll drop below the radar, simply focus on the daystar

[Sev Statik]
It seems to me I'm hated because I choose to be creative
I'm like a leper in a town of fools
An outcast making statements against deception sending us all to hell
Worshipping the image of wealth with a poor image of self

[Listener]
Doing work, causing hurt, always writing verbs
Speak absurd when you heard how I say these words
Fleshing out pounds of truth from this recording booth
When you finally came to care about this curse I bear

[Hook]
