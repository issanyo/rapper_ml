[Intro: Listener]
Underground rise
Sunrise to sunset
My man Dez, Sev Statik, the Listener

[Verse 1: Listener]
We got a sticky situation, see
You're the gum in the beautiful hair of hip-hop
And I'm the crunchy peanut butter comb causing lips to lock
Rocking flip-flops, the bridge is out
The bridge is out and you're all watered down
Soaking neck deep prune-skinned and your awkward situation lusting to tell off with my sound
I understand you got a lot of opportunities on the horizon
And so many surprises, yeah right
Focus is the key and the lock is your happy medium
But your sloppy disposition is the only frame of mind in your feeding bin
Rap tight to your shrink
If our lives were lawns, the gnomes would be roaring
If my mom was beautiful, my thoughts'd be adorable
Even a smooth brainer could answer most of these questions
And probably quite possibly learn two or three lessons

[Hook]
It's your heart that gets these people to listen
It's the words you say that molds the vision
It's the road you choose and the thoughts you thought
You could think but no cost for the cause of it all

[Verse 2: Sev Statik]
Well I spill for the few, never overrated
Always underestimated but notice I made it
I took time out to think and gave 'em the best meal
Owned up to mistakes and didn't blame, didn't squeal
Told 'em I hated school but loved skipping class
Finished all assignments eleventh hour to pass
I just didn't have the attention span
For the lies on how apes evolved into man
Man is that a crock or maybe it was a gator
You a smudge and I thank God for erasers
I suppose Christ didn't die and Simon took his place
Take a second look before sky splitting takes place
And takes the ones holding faith in Jesus
Hades is waiting the same blending in dark instrumentals
Smiling, lying straight to your face
While you sweat running a secular humanistic race
Whatever pace you set, you ain't crossing the line
Getting by on man's knowledge, paying homage to a dead sky
Go ahead and make the sign of the cross
Bring it to your job but don't say nothing to your boss

[Hook]
It's your heart that gets these people to listen
It's the words you say that molds the vision
It's the road you choose and the thoughts you thought
You could think but no cost for the cause of it all

[Verse 3: Dezin8ed]
Most of this means nothing to the ones you listen to
You got holes in your screen
Even though it's bugged, it's getting through
So purchase products and be quiet, happy citizens
You'll even catch me giving in
To the silence who's actually listening
Yell out some du-duh du-duh, dont' take it from me dummy
Check your id, your ego, super-ego and them three monkeys
One with his hands over his ears
One with his hands over his eyes
One with his hands over his mouth
And you can't be exposed to the lies
When you go through your life 'til you're old and you die
Looking for the gold with the brightest glitter
And they sold the prize to the highest bidder
Your shoulder provides you with the chips you pretend to stack
And if the recipients get the message, then they'll probably send it back
My crew don't want me to befriend the wack
But how they gonna get any better?
Said I was pretending to be black
I just think I'm pretending to be clever
But directly inside, you got no heart, no wonder your chest hurts
So stop asking for a transplant punk, maybe next verse

[Hook]
It's your heart that gets these people to listen
It's the words you say that molds the vision
It's the road you choose and the thoughts you thought
You could think but no cost for the cause of it all
