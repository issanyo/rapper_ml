[Intro]
Yeah, better watch yourself

[Verse 1: Sev Statik]
But we gave y'all a concept of white sheets and blue-pin stripes
Showed y'all how to rep for Christ at open microphone sessions
We stay tight in the work that's fresh to us
Any crew can get served shopping at Text-R-Us
You will be taxed, asked to leave the premises
Right here in my nemesis enemy in the flesh
With my lessons in Genesis, I insist you take time to listen
Raphi been told y'all you picked the wrong crew to be dissin'
So instead of planting seeds, you soiled our name in dirt
And grew deep inside jealousy
Trippin' cause you ain't heard from most of us in a minute
Well we on God's time, all else is ignorance
Just get prepared for all these Tunnel Rat twelve-inches
We ain't going mainstream but our sound has a new vision
So stop policin' negative words around this crew
You supposedly hate but be the first to commentate

[Hook: ?]
I keep my eyes on the line finish
I might quit it if I'm dead
But instead I know these heads on my side hid it
Yet so many steady question just why I did it
And I'm readily replyin', "Finish line, is it?"

[Verse 2: Elsie]
And I be that Puerto-Rican shorty bordering y'all territory
Just cause I'm a female don't mean y'all can ignore me
From the Sony to the Panasonic, listeners left catatonic
Blown away, lyrics I thrown away, still they want it
Give me a mic and a track, let's make up for these wack emcees
Making tracks on they MPCs
Bound to take this is your great escape into the world of real music
Tunnel Rat exclusive
For those who are sick of the game, don't want the same old thing
We hittin' straight to the brain, TRz will never be tame
Making our claim running tracks through every grain
Of this Earth giving birth to new sound and new life
A new girl is a new breed that won't leave until we
Capture the attention of the listener
Should I say prisoner of radio lies and television?
Cause you can't receive the truth until it's given
(So here it is!)

[Hook: ?]
I keep my eyes on the line finish
I might quit it if I'm dead
But instead I know these heads on my side hid it
Yet so many steady question just why I did it
And I'm readily replyin', "Finish line, is it?"

[Verse 3: Jurny Big]
When I join the ranks of those who thank the Lord
With think tanks of flows and banks of know-how
Did not know then but I know now just exactly how it goes
How it goes down and it sounds ill but I still keep it moving
Provin' to my God and to my crew that what I doing is for you
And stay breathin' though my enemies be leavin'
Slugs in my reason and shanks in what I believe in
So whether I'm bleeding or not, a lot look red
And I realized quick that I'm not good dead
So Jurny Big's amazin', still preys on talents weak
'Cause learn from out the gate in the midst of challenge peak
My term been blaze in form of embedded phrase
While underneath the sun blazin' with hands raised
Like Mercury on summer days, I rise to the occasion
Stepped out from behind the mountain with my pens ablazin'
To the finish

[Hook: ?]
I keep my eyes on the line finish
I might quit it if I'm dead
But instead I know these heads on my side hid it
Yet so many steady question just why I did it
And I'm readily replyin', "Finish line, is it?"

I keep my eyes on the line finish
I might quit it if I'm dead
But instead I know these heads on my side hid it
Yet so many steady question just why I did it
And I'm readily replyin', "Finish line, is it?"
