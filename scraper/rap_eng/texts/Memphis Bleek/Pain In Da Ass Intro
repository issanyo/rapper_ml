[Interlude]
Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a part of Roc-a-Fella
I mean for me, it was bigger than being President of the United States
To me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodys
They weren't like anybody else, I mean they did whatever they wanted
They could double park in front of a hydrant, nobody every bothered giving them a ticket
In the summer when they shot dice all night, nobody ever bothered calling the cops
I mean, to us living the way was nuts to us
Those goodie, good people who work shitty jobs for bumb paychecks
Worrying about their bills, taking a subway to work every day were dead
I mean, they were suckers, they had no balls
If we wanted something, we just took it
If anybody complained twice, they would get hit so bad they would never complain again
It was just our routine, we never even thought twice about it
Okay, are we loaded?
