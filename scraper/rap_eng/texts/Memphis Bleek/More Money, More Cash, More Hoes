[Intro: Jay-Z]
Turn the lights even lower!
Hova
Memphis Bleek
Beanie Sigel (uh huh)
Roc-A-Fella y'all (yeah yeah)
(DMX) Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
To the top with my niggas
Pop with my niggas
Drive by in whips, rock rocks with my niggas
Break day on the hottest block with my niggas
Just cause I (DMX) love my niggas (uh huh)
Chill with the crew (uh huh)
Real with the crew
Four million sold, look, still with the crew
Break bread with the fam
'Til I'm dead with the fam
Duck cops, shake feds with the fam
Flip them pies with my hustlers (uh huh)
Ride for my hustlers
Die for my, lie for my, cry for my hustlers
Roll with my dunns (uh huh)
Cold with the guns (uh huh)
If he slow with my ones hit the floor when I come
I fuck with them hoes that fuck with them clothes
That's real with them shoes, keep it real with they dudes
I'm sick with the flow and this is all I know
More money, more cash, more hoes BEYACHHHH!!!!!!

[Hook: Jay-Z (DMX)]

More money, more cash, more hoes (what)
More money, more cash, more hoes (uh)
More money, more cash, more hoes (come on)
More money, more cash, more hoes (what, what, what)

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Ay yo, M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek
No need to dress warm, I brought plenty of heat
Y'all can't do nothing with this here
For one, I pack three 9s like the year
Y'all funny money hustlas
7 gram hustlas
Type to bust a O down with ya man hustlas
I hold bank dough, dough 6-5-4
While you ho talk that, look for a walk dough
Petty crime niggas
Petty time niggas
Sold petty drugs came up with petty thugs
Now you got game in you
Wanna be a menace and you got Caine in you
I'll put them thangs in you
I'm a hot lil' nigga
I ain't gotta tell niggas
You came too deep, one fell niggas
I'm layin in the cut but still don't give a fuck
Roc-a-fella forever, Memph man, what what

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Peep the kid from P-H-I-L-L-Y
North West South West Southside
Spit it for them bitches and niggas who stay fly
B-Mack, Roc-A-Fella till I die
Met Jay, dropped on a album in a week
Without unsigned hype or battle of the beats
The first time niggas heard me spit it in the streets
I gave y'all "1000 Bars" with Memphis Bleek
Stay strapped, heat in the car under the seat
6 hammers even though we only 3 deep
We clap up niggas
Smack up niggas
Duck tape, rope, and wrap up niggas
Think shit a joke, go head crack up niggas
Get treated like Coke and get capped up niggas
The only thing funny
Is y'all never seen big face money
Till them big face 20s

[Hook]

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Roc-A-Fella shit
1999 (uh huh)
You about to witness a dynasty (you are not ready) unlike no other
Get down or lay down ya heard!
No publishin' for niggas
I know y'all niggas wonderin, like:
When them niggas gone stop? (come on)
We got a date for you-
February 31st, 19-neva hate (haha)
I know y'all niggas ready to kill yourself, too
Just go head and do it!
Jump off a building, slit ya wrists!
Just do it!
The world'll be a better place (haha)
Roc-A-Fella
Beanie Seigel
Memphis Bleek
Hovah Hovah
Ya heard me!
