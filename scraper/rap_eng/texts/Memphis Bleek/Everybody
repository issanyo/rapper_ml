[Intro]
Yeah (uh huh)
What they want god?
Niggas know the deal here
It's real...yea

[Verse 1]
I was told "get money", stack what I can
Born In the Vile, a nigga never ran
Seen niggas get cut, shot, stabbed up and kidnapped
Ran over, double-crossed, killed for a stack of green one's
Now I live life, do or die, Marcy, son, everybody trying to survive
Maintain yo strip, cocaine this shit
We ain't leavin' 'til we drain this shit
Playin this shit, street life, but most of y'all hate Bleek right?
I'm supposed to keep heat right?
So you can haul the heat right, who really give a fuck though
I grew up amongst cut-throats, nigga, we all want dough
It's a all out thing, drugs produce cream, guns produce human beings
Nigga what you think? I got one, stop one, Naw
Drop one, can't stop one, I'm here 'til the cops come

[Chorus]
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some

[Verse 2]
By my area code, you know I'm able to roll
I'm a Brook-Nam nigga, we lock and load
Dodge y'all, my hungry niggas spot y'all
Ready to bury niggas wit 50 shots y'all
You hot god
Stop y'all, from poppin y'all lil nickels to Moroccan zones
I'm making somebody cripple
The strip's the issue and my dogs will siC you
While yo body bag flow, the body bag's full
I twist Kelly over backboard, ready to push the Caddy on the curb
And smack dudes, I'm wit O.G cars, flip Oz's huh?
Don't sleep huh
I'm tryin to eat huh
Real to the heart, you real?
We can start a lil somethin together, start frontin together
Get this money right, muthafuck, hater niggas
Shots to them traitor niggas, and fake niggas
Yo, muthafuckazz...

[Chorus]
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some

[Verse 3]
Yo Dead or alive
I'm forced to put the metal to guys
Raise my right under oath, I ain't tellin no lies
I'm wanted alive, last nigga try to survive
Blast niggas, you can ask niggas how to get by
Stay rollin alive, brand chocolates huh
Gunz so big, by time you see the spark, you die
Niggas ordered a spy, won't stop till we all in the sky
Or get caught bustin down the pie
Crack a bottle for niggas who ain't here or doin time
In the box, gettin stops, burnt blocks for dimes
All my niggas sittin, tented wit .9mm's
Been doin or still in it wit crimes, Fuck the innocent kind
I ain't repentin 'til I die, gettin head is my alibi
I wasn't there when niggas blazed and that coward died
I'll make a stiff make you niggas raise up, blaze up
Yo last days is up, Mufuckazzz....

[Chorus]
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
If you got money, everybody wants some
If you got a dope flow, everybody wants some
Yo drug game is tight, everybody wants some
When a nigga get right, everybody wants some
Muthafuckaz........
Faggot ass niggas always want some when
A nigga get some Get yo own you bastards
My clique gon forever shine for Nine-Nine
Past three like the year, want it?
Get it nigga.....
