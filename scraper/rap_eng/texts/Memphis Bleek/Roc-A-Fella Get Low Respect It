[Intro: Pain in Da Ass]
You know, we'd always call each other Rocafella's, like you'd say to somebody you're gonna like this guy, he's one of us, he's Rocafella, you understand? We're Rocafella's, Gangster. But not just any rapper could be made, I mean to become a member of Rocafella you gotta be 100 percent from the streets so they can trace your name all the way back to your old hood. See it's the highest honour they can give you. Means you belong to a Dynasty. Means nobody get to fuck around with yo, also means you couldn't fuck around with anybody just as long as they aren't a member of Rocafella. It's like a license to steal, license to do anything, and with Jay stepping down, it was Bleek's turn to be made
Okay, I'm reloading!

[Memphis Bleek]
Ayo Roc-A-Fella Records runnin the streets reckless
Get Low the future you gotta respect it
The hood's still in back of me, guns still beside of me
Still for the street, hoes they wanna ride wit me
Big print like I just hit lottery
Like y'all can't see a nigga straight from poverty
We ghetto, we're gutter, where you don't come around
Some dudes make records and say they underground, BUT
I choose not to go that far cuz I was born there pa
I don't gotta write bars you niggas see my scars
And you know my story
I'm more for the war I'm bout guts & glory
Them other dudes front for y'all I can't do it
I don't gotta sell my soul to sell music
I put the beat on, Murder'll roll the weed up
Put it on the street one week, watch it heat up
Heavy rotation rockin on Hot 9
You niggas get your money right cuz I got mine
And it's Roc-A-Fella Records runnin the streets wreckless
Get Low the future you gotta respect it
I been in it since 9-6 before I could drive whips
To focus on gettin' paid before "Coming of Age"
Niggas they understand the boy done became a man
Loyal to all my peeps that's why I did for the fam
Who the FUCK, WANT, WHAT
None of you niggas I'm right back cuz I ain't done wit the bidniss
Them niggas owe me a check, niggas owe me respect
I give you that good game I told you I been M.A.D.E
And it's Roc-A-Fella Records runnin the streets wreckless
Get Low the future you gotta respect it
And I'm from the M to the A to the R-C-Y/why
So many niggas be hatin' they don't want me to ride
But, you see Bleek just livin' his life
Instead you wanna see a nigga throwin' that iron
Well, so be it
It's many dudes in the team that ain't family now
And y'all see it
Dynasty though, it remain the same
So every time you throw it up you know who changed the game homie
The ROC army; Get Low and State Property
Caked up in real estate and never played Monopoly
But why them niggas wanna act all aggy
Cuz of the bigger plate and I got more baggies?
But shit where's the love
I could tell you it ain't nuttin over here but new guns & slugs
And it's all about the butter, you ain't listen baby boy?
That the ROC'll never lose we just kill & destroy
And it's Roc-A-Fella Records runnin the streets wreckless
Get Low the future you gotta respect it
