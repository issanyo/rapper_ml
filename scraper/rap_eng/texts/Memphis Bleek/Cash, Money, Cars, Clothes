[Verse 1]
It's them niggas again
Young Memph Bleek, Ruff Endz
Their back, R.E., I hope your ready
Yeah another one, yeah another one
All my ballers, glass in the air
We gon' get the club rollin'
We gon' get the club poppin, please believe me

Let's go

[Chorus 1]
We get the cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
Coppin' them whips
Stackin' them chips
Cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
This is how playas play

[Verse 2]
Yo we don be more cats so we doin big things
Bein' more cats with thugged out chains
Trips over seas, shoppin' sprees
I used to stand in line now I'm VIP
Comin' through stunnin'
20's on the truck
Model chicks in the back
Yo they tryin to fuck
Things different now
Got money now
Just bought a new crib
New M now

[Chorus 2]
We gon' toss it up tonight
We gon' do it up tonight
Poppin' bottles of Cris tonight
Status VIP tonight
Model chicks and ecstacy
Chillin' at the bars, eyes on me
Ain't no thing to spend the G
All you haters can't see me

[Chorus 1]
We get the cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
Coppin' them whips
Stackin' them chips
Cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
This is how playas play

[Verse 3]
Ladies, Puerto Rican to Black
Asians, White girls throwin' back
Poppin' bottle of Cris
Case at a time
The VIP jumpin', nuttin' but dames
All my dames across the world
My US and my UK girls
Ridin' into Amsterdam keepin' it hot
London to NY we party nonstop

[Chorus 2]
We gon' toss it up tonight
We gon' do it up tonight
Poppin' bottles of Cris tonight
Status VIP tonight
Model chicks and ecstacy
Chillin' at the bars, eyes on me
Ain't no thing to spend the G
All you haters can't see me

[Chorus 1]
We get the cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
Coppin' them whips
Stackin' them chips
Cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
This is how playas play

[Verse 4: Memphis Bleek]
You know I drove in and out of the rove
I put a dent in the back seat of the Bent
Baby I'm young Memph
Of the R.O. clique
Money I spit
Its untraceable
I'm a dog, I'm untameable
M easy, so fresh so clean
My shit look so sick
Walk mean
Ice, it really don't matter
It's so clear she can fix her mascara
But you know I strip her right out of the vicky thong
Take her to the mall let her pick what she want
Let her see the team
She can freak who she wants
Cuz ma, I'm Bleek I don't keep, I don't love but
I never slip, ma I stay grip
Walk like they too tight, I don't slip
I get dough, this is get low
Ride with Ruff Endz
Let niggas know, huh

[Chorus 2]
We gon' toss it up tonight
We gon' do it up tonight
Poppin' bottles of Cris tonight
Status VIP tonight
Model chicks and ecstacy
Chillin' at the bars, eyes on me
Ain't no thing to spend the G
All you haters can't see me

[Chorus 1]
We get the cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
Coppin' them whips
Stackin' them chips
Cash, money, cars, clothes
This is how true ballers roll
Sittin' on thangs, thugged out chains
This is how playas play

[Verse 5]
Yeah, it's them niggas again
Young Memph Bleek, Ruff Endz
It's them cats who hate and never congratulate
You know we get dough
We back, club is ours, streets is mine
Let's do it
