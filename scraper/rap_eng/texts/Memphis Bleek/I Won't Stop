[Intro: Memphis Bleek]
Yea Memph Bleek(it's not a game)
Get this money(no doubt)
For the Nine double(and home I am wit no trouble)
I stumble thru the Jungle
Yea what y'all want?
Uh huh take it personal
That's right Check it out
Ey yo

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
I push the bum drop, the M-e-m-p-h man keep the gun hot
And now I live where you come ? I go to war where you bag chicks
Floss where you can't sit, what the fuck y'all want?
I do the things that you can't do, fly to the ankle, cock pick the shorty
You Asleep when I came through, it's fucked up what this game'll do
Next thing that's fucked up is when I aim at you, spit eight at your Range Rove
If you ever talk shit like I ain't know, you get it right, I Play corners
Pocket full of drugs, two dollars from a dub
Then I holla I don't really give a fuck
We raw, green you ain't seen before
Chicks stink wit a ass you ain't squeezed before
Got guns now, that hold 16 or more
For you crab ass niggas who wanna meet the floor

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Dark Half)]
Yea I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm the type to pull rank, hold shanks, project huss-elar
Walk where you can't muthafucka, for the Nine double
My S1 still bubble, test one, you gon feel the M-1 touch you
Gunz galore, smoke tons of raw, how you ball before?
Never ran the floor, never run scrimmage, if you ever take my image
I'ma see to it you niggas gon hemorrhage
Bleed from the waist down, leave you face down
For cashin the bricks, Bleek spray towns, this game of life
You on the line, I'll play foul, better pass the rock
Or jump outta bounds, I get techs in the game
I foul y'all flagrant, hurt y'all severely, you da type that be hatin
Sub Bleek These niggas guard box time
Let the bench get in the game and spark that side, mufucka

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & (Dark Half)]
Yea I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
I won't stop(for bitch niggas, broke all yo life affiliate wit rich niggas)
