You're now rockin with the 18th Letter (stop)
Bring it to the 15th letter (stop)
Now wait for the 2nd one
My people on the front line like it's lebanon
My girl wanna leave I get a better one
I don't be beggin them I just beckon em
Now tell me what you reckon hun
I reckon it's jam done when the record spun
How do you make a sick flow better?
Prognosis from the doc said never
Do you hear what I'm sayin I'm too clever
For my own good I wonder will they catch up ever
Not probably, you are not on the same level as bobby
I am not on the same level as all these competitors
The waits over tell em pack it up Game Over

Game Over, I thought I told you this was done
When you first heard me spit in tongues
I don’t understand why you are continuing to try
Game Over…Game Over

They call me Killer Kelly, See me on the Tele-
Vision with the message like melle from the heli
Copter flow, bad man dr no, so if you don't then you
Act cos you ought to know
You're now rockin with the no-one better get it?
Relax for a sec on that thought let it..
Settle and digest that even when I'm dumbin it down
Don't try test the king, rob kelly Im excellent
Rappers fake tough guys like wrestlin
But this ain't no sucker shit no jim duggan shit
Still have the 4X4's you're not f*ckin with
The b-hop of the street hop with a mean topless chick
With a d-cup smokin weed in a cheap option holiday inn
Parked on the stay over tell them pack it up Game Over

Game Over, I thought I told you this was done
When you first heard me spit in tongues
I don’t understand why you are continuing to try
Game Over…Game Over

Game Over - Told Ya
Bleek still here like a Soldier..
Ridin through dublin in a rover n*gga
Me and rob kelly we will fold ya
Never in the party, without my army
Speakin like im irish y'all got to pardon me
Let me get back to it
Tryin to get wasted where my fluid
Everybody drunk what the f*ck is up
Couple b*tches with us now they will suck us up
And everybody walk around down to knuckle up
So come out here acting tough they will fuck you up
I got my dog rob kelly and the homie mo-k
Tryin get drunk tell em bring the rose
Im from BK NY Streets its Kush Gang World Wide
What the fuck y'all think Game Over

Game Over, I thought I told you this was done
When you first heard me spit in tongues
I don’t understand why you are continuing to try
Game Over…Game Over
