[Intro: Memphis Bleek]
That's how we do it
That real shit
This for my motherfuckin' niggas
Ayo, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
I swear to God I'm addressin' all types of shit
Tote big guns, with all types of clips
See them cars I be in, all types of whips
All those whores I got, all types of chicks
See those sneaks I rock, all types of kicks
In the double XL, in all types of flicks
On my two way pager, typin' shit
I made a lot of records, all type of hits
I was told to get dough, all types of chips
Flip weed, coke, dough, all types of bricks
I've been overseas, on all types of trips
My coke come on a boat, all types of ships
Catch me on La Cienega, S type and shit
The new CL, type S and shit
And I bust guns at all types of clicks
Took four and made all types of flips, motherfucker

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
We got the S class, the Cadillac, and excel
We blowin' up y'all, we got all types of V's
We got the chocolate, Hawaiian skunk, and purple haze
Roll it up y'all, we got all types of trees
We got the 4-4, the Glock nine, and bright ghost
We throw it up y'all, we got all types of guns
We got the pesos, the dolla bills, the yen and mar
Throw it up y'all, we got all types of ones

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
(Yo, yo, check it)
Fuckin' with these records, I made all types of deals
Fuckin' with these wild dudes, I tote all types of steel
Fuckin' with these streets, I'm in all types of beef
And now, that I'm on, I got all types of creeps
Movie stars, chickenheads, all types of freaks
Hydro, chocolate, all types of trees
Bentleys, widebodies, all types of V's
Yamaha's, snowmobiles, all types of skis
Know Bleek done it all, all types of things
Know the squad rock ice, all types of bling
And I learnt from the best, all types of vets
You know I throw it up, on all types of sets
And you know I hear it all, all types of hate
But Bleek benchpress all types of weight
When my shit drop, I'm gonna get all types of scans
And rap the logo on all types of vans, motherfucker

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek]
We got the S class, the Cadillac, and excel
We blowin' up y'all, we got all types of V's
We got the chocolate, Hawaiian skunk, and purple haze
Roll it up y'all, we got all types of trees
We got the 4-4, the Glock nine, and bright ghost
We throw it up y'all, we got all types of guns
We got the pesos, the dolla bills, the yen and mar
Throw it up y'all, we got all types of ones
We got the S class, the Cadillac, and excel
We blowin' up y'all, we got all types of V's
We got the chocolate, Hawaiian skunk, and purple haze
Roll it up y'all, we got all types of trees
We got the 4-4, the Glock nine, and bright ghost
We throw it up y'all, we got all types of guns
We got the pesos, the dolla bills, the yen and mar
Throw it up y'all, we got all types of ones
