In my life (echoes two times)
In my life (echoes two times)

(Chorus)
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
There's been heartache and pain
In my life
There's been heartache and pain

I'm still that regular, cetera cat, from the street
Thuggin it, lovin my life as Memph Bleek
But I'm stuck with, huggin that block, sellin that D
Grew up with, nothin but killas and O.G.'s
I'm the product of the ghetto 'til they bag me up
With a bail stash in case they snatch me up
I'm a soldier in this war and I resemble my pops
I ain't nothin like him, that's where this criminal stop
I provide for the fam, divide them grams
Cook it, make flips, survival plans
Bein successful, I had every intent
But I went to the high school a playin the bench
We live off wit, just like our switch-up strips
I was raised by the gun so I switch up clips
Gettin my hustle on, tryna switch up kicks
I won't change bein thug, I won't switch up shit
It's my life nigga

(Chorus)

I've put work in, for me to reach this level
To let the world know that I speak for the ghetto
I've been through the struggle, downfall and the hurt
Puttin the close one, deep in the dirt
I lost one a my road dogs in nine-eight
I still see him everytime I look in his mom's face
But don't cry (ma'), we gon' see the light
I know he up in Heaven and he gon' lead us right
I live by the street so I'm a die by the street
As long as I'm alive his daughter'll never need
We used to be this close
But now it feel we this far apart, me and that nigga can't talk
We can't bag and kick it, bag some bitches
Only time I see 'em, is when I glance at pictures
But I gotta face the fact, my nigga is gone
But I'm a ride to the death, and still I mourn
In my life nigga

(Chorus)

In my life (echoes two times)
In my life (echoes two times)

Sometimes I just grab the car keys and ride
With no music, I'm just ridin the vibe
I done came a long way, from usin the plate
Touchin the eight, who would've thought I'd make it today
It was just yesterday, moms waitin on the stamps
The spot got shot up, and Dre still locked up
It's me against the world with no brother, just a revolver
And I ain't thinkin about seein tomorrow
I got sixty-two grams and a six-shot eight
With plans to hit the block and get shit straight
But my dog just got shot, spot just got rushed
I lost all my weight when the crack pot bust
I was left with zip, zero, nothin
That's when I realized that my life ain't 'bout nothin
The world wouldn't understand Bleek in the street
So I took it to the booth and gave y'all the speech

(Chorus) 2x
