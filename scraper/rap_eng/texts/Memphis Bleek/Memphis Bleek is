[Verse 1]
Memph Bleek where the hoez at
Be where the dough at
Treez, yo I blow dat
C's yo I hold that
Guns, yo I tote that
O's, sold that
Blow niggas for stuntin, Fuck y'all frontin
The war you could get that
Spit till I sip that
Gunz, neva sit back
Money I'ma get that
Mind I don't play y'all
Bleek still the same y'all
Aim the rod then I blaze the squad
All the hoes roll the weed up
You know that it's G's up
Roll till you eat some
I flow for the threesomes
Chickens I don't need them
Snitches I'ma see them
Meet em with the guns and heat em with the one's
If you feel that you die-proof, .45 proof
I'll find where they hide you, outline you
You niggas know the name and my bitches know the game
I'm in it for life and want all y'all to say
It's life, Money... drugs... murder for life, what you think y'all

[Chorus]

Memph Bleek is...(money)
Memph Bleek is...(money)
Memph Bleek is...(drugs)
Memph Bleek is...(money holda, shot caller, blunt smoka, hot roller)

[Verse 2]
Yo these streets, I control now
Creep on the low now
Empty and reload now
See me on the flow now
Drugs I could move quick
Thug on my new strip
Pump till I move bricks
Floss till I lose chips
? got it gemmed up
Accord got it rimmed up
Roll wit da dog On top is where you end up
Ride in a hot whip
Live in a hot crib
Spend what you got Memph
I'm about that hot shit
Bitches give me Brain Now
Bleek do his thang now
Eat em hoez the same now
Creep In the game now
Lay up wit the right bird
Me, I'm tryin to slice first
Tryin to flow suttin you go head and owe suttin
I'm high...roll suttin
You Die if you know suttin
And break me off wit some of the O's or suttin
The M-e-m-p-h man, Memph Bleek don't play
We all gotta eat Swizz Beats make 'em say
Money Drugz Murda for Life what you think y'all huh

[Chorus]
