[Verse 1: Tek]
My mind ain't here, shit been gone (Nigga!)
Niggas can't comprehend the shit that I'm on (I'm coo coo for cocoa puffs nigga!)
Raised as a rebel, danced with the devil
Niggas can't get on my level swing at me!
I'm history in the makin'
Be with the dreads so they think I'm Jamaican
They throw consignment on the loan
I get it and I run it back like Thomas Jones
Play my position like a wide out (Like a wide out)
Guns in the slot when I ride out (Slot when I ride out)
And I'm H-N-I-C
From N-Y-C! Free Prodigy!
Sling more O's than the alphabet
If I ain't got it, they ain't invent it yet
You know the city of the gunplay
Make a million dollars on any given sunday

[Chorus: Steele & Tek & Pete Rock]
[Steele:]
We seen hard time

[Tek]
Came from the bottom so we mean on the grind (We on top of the world!)

[Pete Rock:]
Big dreams in my eyes

[Steele]
Though some fail others succeed over time (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
And reach for the skies

[Pete Rock]
All you gotta do (Is believe you can fly) (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
Go hard

[Steele:]
In due time, find true reward

[Pete Rock:]
When you shine

[Steele]
That's when you on top of the world (We on top of the world)
You on top of the world (We on top of the world)
Top of the world (We on top of the world)

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
Top, when I shine, you shine
Everybody get in position in due time
New York State of Mind, always on the grind
Seventeen shots in the 9
Stay away from swine, pigs they be one us
FUCK the informants, tell them motherfuckers that I'm tourin
Plus tell the haters, I crossed the equator - twice
I done seen places where it's six months a night
But I come from the crib, flytraps on the ceiling
Roaches on the wall, but I'm hustlin out the building
Smokers cop and go, lady on the phone tellin cops 'bout the flow
But this is Get Low, seen in Jamaica, migratin from the stress
They call us kush gang cause we only smoke the best (Best)
With the Smif-N-Wes', Brooklyn show respect
YES!

[Chorus: Steele & Tek & Pete Rock]
[Steele:]
We seen hard time

[Tek]
Came from the bottom so we mean on the grind (We on top of the world!)

[Pete Rock:]
Big dreams in my eyes

[Steele]
Though some fail others succeed over time (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
And reach for the skies

[Pete Rock]
All you gotta do (Is believe you can fly) (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
Go hard

[Steele:]
In due time, find true reward

[Pete Rock:]
When you shine

[Steele]
That's when you on top of the world (We on top of the world)
You on top of the world (We on top of the world)
Top of the world (We on top of the world)

[Verse 3: Steele]
Yeah! I'm in love with New York, I ain't talkin 'bout Tiffany
New York I'm in love with my city
From the grimey to the gritty from the shiny to the ritzy
From the courtyard to the Garden where the Knicks be
Fitted cap Yankee, pitcher like Pettitte
In the dougie blowin stankee
I know how to get it plus the repertoire lanky
I know how to spit it
See me at the world series in the race for the pennant
I'm the New York Giant - Name on the poster
Couldn't even be as high if you was sittin on my shoulders
Still like I could put the Brooklyn Bridge on my back
Strong high I rep the city I ain't talkin 'bout attack
You can tell where I'm from it don't matter where I'm at
From the Tim's to the grin to the jeans to the strap
With a grand lookin mean to the means we get trapped
Know we mean everything and we scream in our rap

[Chorus: Steele & Tek & Pete Rock]
[Steele:]
We seen hard time

[Tek]
Came from the bottom so we mean on the grind (We on top of the world!)

[Pete Rock:]
Big dreams in my eyes

[Steele]
Though some fail others succeed over time (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
And reach for the skies

[Pete Rock]
All you gotta do (Is believe you can fly) (We on top of the world!)

[Tek:]
Go hard

[Steele:]
In due time, find true reward

[Pete Rock:]
When you shine

[Steele]
That's when you on top of the world (We on top of the world)
You on top of the world (We on top of the world)
Top of the world (We on top of the world)
