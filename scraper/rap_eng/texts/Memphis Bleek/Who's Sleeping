[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Ayo who sleeping on Bleek? Nigga, wake his ass up!
I'ma show 'em all the money and the ass I pass up
How I'm N-Y deep, who snitched to NYP
You bitches been dropping D's Since '86 striped Lees
Dial 9-1 tips when I spit one clip
Supposed to be killing niggas but ain't really done shit
I'm loco, tote the 4-4, Smoke El Producto
Drow flow, blow the smoke slow and holler fuck hoes
It's cash and money, nines grab the green weed (exactly!)
One shot lives and daiquiris
My gat be stashed in the dash, mixed herbs and hash
On a cruise for cash I might bruise some cats
Spit 2 at you dudes that act
Like you can't be touched, front and lose your cap
I incinerate guns after bodies I caught, son
Never on the run and stack mail by the tons, son!

[Chorus: Reb]
Yo, it's that Roc-a-Fella shit, hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit, give a fuck who you with
We them niggas coming through, locking down your strips
Some real niggas that walk around with guns on their hips!
Yo, it's that Roc-a-Fella shit, hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit, give a fuck who you with
We them niggas coming through, locking down your strips
Some real niggas that walk around with guns on their hips!

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
I live my life now like none of y'all faggots
You keep fronting like that? I'ma let one of y'all have it
I keep the fours drawn, when I wake up the war's on
For the bread, butter and chips shit...I go to war for 'em
Tinted my whip now, these cops ride dick now
Money spend now. I move work through my pen pal
Niggas hate Bleek cause I live through this shit
You niggas keep hating 'cause I could deal with this shit
I'm a street individual. Sold-it-all criminal
Weed just a minimum. I'm a M-P emblem
Roc syndicate and flips in the block
Regardless if I been or not, you call it I lick a shot
I'm street wise, went up on my caps in size
Who getting money over here? Contact these guys!
Let 'em know I set up shop to trey eight the block
With 3 niggas 1 gun and a buck 50 to shop

[Chorus: Reb]
Yo, it's that Roc-a-Fella shit, hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit, give a fuck who you with
We them niggas coming through, locking down your strips
Some real niggas that walk around with guns on their hips!
Yo, it's that Roc-a-Fella shit, hoes clothes to whips
Act up and get hit, give a fuck who you with
We them niggas coming through, locking down your strips
Some real niggas that walk around with guns on their hips!
