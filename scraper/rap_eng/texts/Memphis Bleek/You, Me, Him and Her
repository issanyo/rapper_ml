[Intro: Jay-Z]
Told y'all
Dynasty, Roc-A-Fella Records, you heard me?
Unstoppable, niggas! Uhh
Memph Bleek, (Jigga) Amil-lion, Sigel Sigel ya heard
It's a Dynasty, who do you believe?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Jigga Man, mo' better, mo' cheddar
Fo's knock the man off your Polo sweater
Roll with the R-O-C, A-Fella
Remember me? The teachers used to fail us
Now it's more scrilla, hoe killers
Fo'-wheelers, we gorillas
Oh please feel us, we heat holders
Fighting? Listen boy, Roy Jones couldn't steal us
The plot thickens, the block clickin'
We got the game tied up, stop trippin'
Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek what, Amil-lion, uhh
Cat be him, El Cap-i-tan
The fire I spit burn down Happyland
Social Club, we unapproachable thugs
Non-social, gone postal
Great aim, harm the arm close to your toast
Like a Don's supposed to Shawn
I thought I told you, these ain't just vocals
Don't make me take it to the old school
I put holes through your hoes too
Through your clothes to the foes to the nigga close to you
Fuck it; Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all
Amil-lion what, Memph Bleek

[Verse 2 : Memphis Bleek]
Yo, y'all dudes don't get it, come widdit
Fifth loaded with slugs that'll rest in your fitted
It's M dot E-M, the Roc be them
Got the mamis sayin' look, who can stop be them
You wanna press your dumb luck, get blam blam-ed up
I crush your larynx, you talk about us nigga
No obituary, I get it critical
You know Memph'll hit the pall bearer liftin' you
When I cock the plastic, make 'em drop the casket
When it's hot, I'm blastin'
It's the Roc, you bastards
Jigga Man what, Amil-lion yeah
Memph Bleek huh, Sigel Sigel c'mon
Spit acid, c'mon
Witcha bullshit smash hit, get your bullshit smashed in
Niggas wanna front and get jumped
Bet the Ruger give your right side a nice-sized lump
Nigga, we are, the supreme squad
You can dream hard but reality is
We push the dream cars, fuck the queen broads
Puff the green raw, we as real as it get
We the R-O-C dot A dot Fellas
Bitches don't talk to us the hoes, they e-mail us
Nigga, Jigga Man what, Memph Bleek huh
Amil-lion yeah, Sigel Sigel rap

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
R (dot) O (dot) C (dot) stop
From Tower to ma and pop, I move out stop
Shower your mom block, move out with Glocks
Raw to the cook, look, move out them blocks
Take it to the bucks who be grindin' it up
Usually take it to the dubs so they diamond it up
Competition, linin' 'em up
Forty-five ACP, let me squeeze lime 'em up
You want, drama what, well silence it up
Since a young buck, violent as fuck
Wasn't me dog, the high will do it
I used to wild off embalmin' fluid, I sent niggas to the trauma unit
Forty-five or the nine'll do it
I fuck around and have your moms go through it - I'm a beast!
Shit, niggas always wanna ye shit, then they wanna cease shit
When they motherfuckin' peeps hit
But I don't cease nothin', I decease som'un
I fuck around and have you sleepin' underneath som'un
Jigga Man what, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek uh, Amil-lion, right

[Verse 4: Amil]
Yo, A to the M-I, feminist
Holding the semi, leave niggas faced with a dilemma
Am I, gon' run or stay, can I
Get away no you can't can't I surrender?
And I, lazy bop, Mercedes hot
In my way through the tunnel like Lady Di

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Jigga Man huh, Sigel Sigel y'all
Memph Bleek what, Amil-lion, uhh
