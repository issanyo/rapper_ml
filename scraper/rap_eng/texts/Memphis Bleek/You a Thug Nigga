[Intro]
Huh?
Yeah
M-e-m-p-h-i-s Bleek
Y'all punk ass niggas

[Chorus]
Is you a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
You a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one

[Verse 1]
Yo check it
Shit, I'm here now, where it's at?
I'm there now, when I walk through the club
The real have stare-downs
And I walk by, lil nigga play the short guy
Pockets is grown, when I cock it, it's on
You believe that, all the chickens be where the trees at
Car hopping bitches be where the V's at
I plot to get mo, stacks and a crib
Sometimes I hear that Ele hold a gat in the crib
Can't relax in the crib
Niggas did max bids
Niggas clap shit, ain't no acting in this
You a playa? Well nigga who you working for?
'Cause who coachin that team that you be otin for?
When I ride by, I know you looking to spray me
But I got a ghetto bird that go half on a three-eighty
It's the game of life, you it, so play it right
Bitches like you, M-e-m-p-h Bleek, yeah right

[Chorus]
Is you a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
Is you a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga (what)
We true thug niggas (Holla)
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one

[Verse 2]
Yo all the money and the guns is nothin to me
'Cause I could withstand the challenge within or without me
Am I right, youngblood?
If not, correct me, y'all ain't got enough money for y'all to check me
You six feet, eight inches, 400 pounds of made niggas that get broke down
This is not a joke now, I'm serious, you feel it in the voice
Don't make me fill this gun up and leave a nigga moist
I'm a get-by criminal, you hear my material
I'm Bed-Sty born, my next stop, gone
Nine trey, shit I had ta run thru my P.J's, cracked floor to nine four
'Til the gats blow and put the snakes where the rats go
And I shut down shops, 'cause I'm burnt
This block is on fire, shit's on fire, shit, you can't call me a liar
Take a look at my rims that bring out my tires
Mufucka

[Chorus]
Is you a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
You a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one

[Verse 3]
Check it out, Yo
Yo, who don't believe me?
Guaranteed to be PG
Young niggas, yo moms won't let you see Bleek
I'm too explicit, if I talk it, I live it
So you lil niggas listen, we play our position
I travel light and carry big heat
Roll deep? Neva, It's nine-nine so whatever
Don't never play Bleek, my squad'll harm you
Send a bunch of arab cabbies thru to bomb you
I smoke dub-sacks, used to fuck thug rats
Now I sitn in the section of bitches above that
Where my thug niggas, slug niggas, tear da club niggas
My " I don't give a FUCK " niggas
It's no love niggas

[Chorus]
Is you a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
You a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
You a thug nigga?
Then bust a slug nigga
It's no love nigga
We true thug niggas
Streets is mine, One nine double nine, we shine
Niggas stack one's act and and catch one
Is you a thug nigga?...
Then bust a slug nigga...
It's no love nigga
M-e-m-p-h Man
Holla...Fuck y'all niggas
