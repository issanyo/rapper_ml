Yea, serious
Aiyyo, this time it's for my family, we ride or die
It's in the blood till the death, now aim for the sky
My fo' blow for sure, for dough, for own land
It's money, drugs, and hot slugs
[Incomprehensible]
Money, drugs and hot slugs
Street scholar keep firing is what they tell me
Money, drugs and hot slugs, R O C
Money, drugs and hot slugs
You know, know, know, know, you know Bleek
Niggas said I can't do, it's funny I done it
The album is here, now who the fuck want it?
I let niggas eat now I'm here to collect
I admit they tried but they ain't rep correct
Now the dinner table's set and it's my time to eat
Don't even wipe your mouth, get up, be out
Don't let the cars fool you or the jewelry blind you
My life's the realest nigga I should write me a novel
This for them broads that'll hold me down
And my niggas on the internet that download my style
And my dog in line in at Chow
Just bangin' with his Walkman playin' me loud
And the nigga with that plate
Choppin' them grams, him and his man
Listening to music that they understand
And that white boy goin' to college
He don't know about the ghetto but know how to hold metal
Them white boys, they'll shoot shit up
They can listen to this shit, I don't give two fucks
But back to it, sippin' on that Cognac fluid
In the Porsche, burnin' the conduit
This is ride music, get the high music
That M dot, hot supply music
That's the answer, life's like cancer
I thought I told y'all niggas I'm serious
It's money, drugs, it's money, drugs
It's money, drugs and hot slugs, you know Bleek
