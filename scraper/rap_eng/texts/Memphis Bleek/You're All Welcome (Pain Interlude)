[Interlude]
From here on, nothing goes down unless I'm involved
No blackjacks, no albums, no nothing
A concert goes down in the park, I want in
You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street
It's my turn
You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money, you fucking hump?
If any of you are tired of getting ripped off by guys like that...
Come see me, I'm at the Marcy Projects, ask for Memphis Bleek
You're welcome
You're all welcome!
