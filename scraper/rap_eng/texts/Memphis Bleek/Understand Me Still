[Memphis Bleek - talking]
Yeah you know, just vibe with me, just understand my life
And ya don't understand me still
I never enjoyed success, but my family did..
And Ama write with that

[Verse 1]
I eat good, smoke good, you see I push the latest whips with the hottest bitch
Take trips to the coast of Bermudas
But dog I'm from Flushing Ave. where I popped, tossed the ruger
And I am Proud of myself, cause me true Dog, never acted never lie to myself
I been in hollywood and back, guess what I'm Still M
Say Number from the blue tops days, I'm still him
You dudes think I'm touring like I'm part of you and out
But is just about the performance, get the money we out
Trying chill, trying to take the wife to eat
But most girl, disrescpectful when they try to speak, as if
They don't understand, Let me live, Ma
I'm with my fam, let me live, and I
Try to be nice about being disrespectful
One gets respects, when show one respect too

[Hook: Memphis Bleek] + (Rell)
But you don't understand me still
I never enjoyed success, but my family will
And Ama write with that (Ama write with that, Ama write with that)
But you don't understand me still
I never enjoyed success, but my family will
And Ama write with that (Ama write with that, Ama write with that)

[Verse 2]
Yo..
I take it back home every chance I get
Because I've been through every ghetto, but home I can't forget
Wish I could take em all, on this ride with me
But it won't be real, and if you asked it ain't be reality
I only fucked with a few, and If you real you know
Soon you go, but if not, you don't yeah
We still family right, that's what you leave me to believe
But ya don't understand my life
I took Dre down to South Beach, just to show him what A few ones to do
When you amongst your crew, we living
I never picture I could ever loose him
But I found myself with the thoughts that I'mma loose him
I put the stash up, I'm just trying to save his life
Just moved moms, had to moved her twice... down to Miami
I thank God everyday of my life, that I could provide for my family

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo..
My brother survive, now everybody's doing fine
I kept my moms away, to let her enjoy life
I wish I could do the same, but I can't theirs work to do
Rent due, there's more work to do
I copped bikes let my niggas ride them
I copped coupes, let my niggas drive them
I'm proud to see my niggas wilding, cause I remember them days
They still vivid of me, huggin the block, young soul committed
When I wrote rhymes dayly
To get my flow up pray one day They whole world could hear me
I love it when the crowd recited every word of it
When they bounce, Let me know that they all a part of it
That two things make me proud of my life
I thought I had it all, but the best give was life
The third ??? I'mma brand new father
Of a Healthy baby boy and its making me work harder

[Hook]

[Rell - singing Outro]
Ya'll don't know, ya'll don't know
And I'mma write with that
All this cold nights risking my life
But it's all good but misunderstood, ya don't know
