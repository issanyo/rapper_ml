[Intro: Jay-Z]
Back again and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
As a youth I used to hold the weed up
Old heads said I thought more like a soldier than a leader
In order to succeed I had to slow my speed up
Didn't listen to stuff took another puff of the cheeba
They said believe us or not trust is something you earn
With every mistake you make back to us you return
Probably would go Hollywood I thought he was joking
My first taste of fame I hit the first thing smoking
All engulfed into honies, the pussy was tight
If she threw the pussy right, I got mushy like
Damn baby I love you take all my cash
"You ain't got to lie Jay," you already gettin' the ass
She loved that I was a thug it turned her on
Soon as I got soft, it turned her off
I got relaxed put my feet up start dissing my friends
And that's when the ceiling fell in

[Chorus 1: Jay-Z]
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I came through with the shines
Like the streets was blind
Didn't master my Algebra, no caliber
Stick me? I was thinking how and for what
But reality bites like a thousand mutts
Nothing worse than the person that's foul with guts
To stick you quicker...

[Verse 3: Memphis Bleek]
...This brand new nigga
Yup, this is the foulest
This ain't Hollywood, it's the Wild West
Whoever guns is the loudest
That's who's the best, now take ten steps and draw
Who dope can take ten steps and remain raw
Who has no regards for the law?
Me that's who, now let me ask you
Did you not know if we all don't eat
Some day that we all would beef?
Did you know about the crabs in the barrel
They would hear me creep
It's a motherfucking war in these streets

[Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again, I'm back again

[Chorus 1: Jay-Z]
From Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again
From Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again

[Verse 4: Sauce Money]
As a youth I used to fold up
Old heads said I thought more like a leader than a soldier
Back in the days never no heat thought shit was cool
Good cat personified even went to school
Learned wild shit made me feel kinda live
Off of nothing with this bullshit 9 to 5
I stayed broke made me easier to provoke
Ready to yoke the first motherfucker that joked
Same dude with the hard bottom
Went from laid back to loc'd out
From talk it over to Todd shot him
Ready to perish all the shit you cherish
Leave you the wettest I got a "You die first" fetish
I can recall helping old chicks across the street
Now I help myself lifting cats off they feet
Can't give a fuck nigga, I just lost my moms
Why I need to feel something steel in both my arms

[Chorus 3: Sauce Money]
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again

[Chorus 2: Memphis Bleek]
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again, I'm back again
I'm from the ghetto to the ghetto
And I'm back again, I'm back again

[Chorus 1: Jay-Z]
I went from Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, back again
From Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, back again

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Uh huh uh geah since y'all niggas don't like to think
I'ma make it real easy for y'all
You got three different types of nigga
First cat, as a youth is real wild
For whatever reason he hit the money or whateverâ€”cooled out
You got one cat that's ghetto, grimy always remained ghetto
You know that type
Then, you got one cat very smart young man
E'rybody wanted him to be a lawyer doctor whatever
Pressure drove him crazy, he wiled out, ha geah...
...Marcy to Hollywood
And back again, and back again
Back again, beatch
