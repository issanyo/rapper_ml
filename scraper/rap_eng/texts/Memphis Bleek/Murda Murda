I feel like a felon with two strikes, mad bullshit in this life
I done seen everything but Christ
Luckily I'm just on probation
You niggas just bullshittin' with bars, the boys you got just trying my patience
Like, I don't carry around banana clips like groceries
With a presence that make em don't wanna get em close to me
Talk about we suppose to be brothers
Don't make me laugh, motherfucka you chose to be
On the side opposing me, no matter what culture you be
From, Young Hova light your ass up explosively
A lil' UGK for ya, pour out the P-A for ya
Had to bring y'all like back in the day for ya
They don't respect nothing else, they something else
Two guns with sons will get inside yourself
Lose two lungs, bullets'll get inside your health
Will take the wind outta your sail, with myself
Niggas for truely in a war with yours truly
While they emulating shit they saw in the Art of War movie
But I'm the writer of Sun Tzu, so whatever son do
I do better, more lyrics, way more cheddar
Catch me if you can, I'm the gingerbread man
Keep pumping em up make me injure bre-thren
Niggas is tryna capitalize off Hov
Like I don't realize, I see the demons inside of they souls
Niggas is dreaming to sell what I sold
Fuckers is fiending to held what I hold
I just know what I know, they respect me all across the globe

Forever you'll wheel around for real
Listen boy, I get it down for real
