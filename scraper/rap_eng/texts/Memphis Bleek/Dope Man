(Verse)
Dope man, dope man, cocaine make me the dope man
I started with a zip and I can’t stop
Still bars, still have the chop out
Fans on me locked and fight
But I’ve been serving bricks for the past hoer
Use to have the plug and pasto
But cash do start and be great on
Started great and round the block, try to pack back
It henny way and gets finy
Been on insa and get spreany
Said he love my hustler but he hate my city
I’m giving too much game and in front of me all can
But he’s gone on the low if he see me on TV
So now I gotta work to your city
And I ain’t talk about do the buster
Just tell me where you at and I can get to you the pack
I’mma have to deliver it to the toel
I got you
That one saying bitch busting on
Mamy’s dancing like this marbling murder
So fine on this feral on my dope
Chain sayin’ touch me and be able to kick

(Hook)
Welcome to the dope game, dope game
All I talk about is the dope game
All I know about it’s the dope game
Cocaine turn me to the dope man
Dope man, dope man x 3
Cocaine made me the man

(Verse)
Let’s get it
Back to the business, let’s get it
Couple bad bitches and they all with it
Gotta do say and gotta do trippin’
Pull up in the big house nigga chilling
Never had a life without my pistol
Now that white hit it’s all that I’m into
Don’t never ever play with my paper
Or I murk you like as instrumental
And my nigga stay ride like I do
Fuck nigga they say they feel like I do
Fuck you lain that’s how I describe you
Pussy nigga put that on my bible
Niggas know when I’m up on this party
And that sow bitch smelling like _________(?)
And I;’m killing this motherfuckers black bottles
My VIP looking like naziest
Too gonna stop me, risk gonna stop me
Sing a bitch home, nigga getting and not be
There niga knock me, hit me with the pain
And if they on cover they were skinny and _____________(?)
Rock tell it, nigga that’s my team
Made a million when I was 16
What the fuck could a nigga tell me x 2
