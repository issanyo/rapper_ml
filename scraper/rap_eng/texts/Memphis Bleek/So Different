[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
I used to jot raps on them paper plates
Now I'm on the block in something with a paper plate
Wrist gold, yeah that's that day and date
They said I fell off, I don't recall that day and date
Weight, cause I've been eatin' since a youngin' nigga
And you, you been runnin' round frontin' nigga
Yeah, you on that dark skin Jermaine shit
And that's the reason I been all up in your main bitch
Money talk nigga's best learn the language
Cause being broke you ain't even in the conversation
You spending all day hating
And I'm just living every day out here like vacation
I'm eating good, I'm getting money nigga
My momma told me get the paper skip the funny's nigga
Streets told me if it's on it's on
Gun a nigga down, spin around, make sure that he gone

[Chorus: Manolo Rose]
You on the net man posing in a rental nigga
Paper plane hats you with the nation nigga
That's not even wifey and you still trippin' nigga
On the gram posting work, that's your shipping nigga
You internet niggas boy you're so different
Y'all niggas crack me up you're so different
These bitches crack me up man they so different
These nigga's don't got money they still shipping

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
If everybody eatin', then tell em bring their stash out
This nigga's faker than these bitches with these ass shots
I be in places that these rappers can't pronounce homie
So get your weight up, and I don't mean an ounce homie
It costs a kilo to lay up in my Lilo nigga
The way I be though nigga trust me they don't see no niggas
I did it my way, Bed-Stuy fly way
And now I'm running round like everyday's a Friday
I change forecast weather what you think
My wife only carry umbrella's in her drink
Homie, we global
Yeah nigga I told you
I tried to show you but you only wanted vocals
My lifestyle just explains who I'm better than
I vacay in places they never saw Americans
These snitch nigga's searching IG for the evidence
And rappers doing comical skits just to be relevant
