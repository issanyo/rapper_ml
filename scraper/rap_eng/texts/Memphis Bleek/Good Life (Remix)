[Memphis Bleek]
Yeah
Yo Spark, put up the Bentley
I'm rollin' witchu
Motown

It be the R-O-C, stop
Shit ain't nothing changed in this Bentley drop
I take ten out
Believe me, Bleek send out
But you ain't livin' for the moment
Ma get out
Yo know the whip sick
Plus it's missing the top
You wanna roll with the ROC then come get hot
I got no tint, why?
Cause the wrist, it sparkle
Beats bump, new shit by Sparkle, come on

[Sparkle]
All of my clothes are tailor-made
And yes, I got a house right off the lake
You know I be spending every day
Don't matter cuz all my bills are paid

Drop top Bentley, Gucci shades
Gamblin in Vegas for a day
Yes brothers, I do until my day
And sistas can't fade me cuz I'm made, see

1 - 	I'm livin' the good life
	I'm partying every night
	I'm watchin' the Cristall flow
	VIP and that's all I know

	Just living that good life
	Still partying every night
	Still watchin' the Cristall flow
	VIP and that's all I know

Private jet to Amsterdam
Thirteen carets on my hands
Wall Street says I'm doin' fine
Drop cash for our countryside

Payin' chauffeurs, butlers, maids
Runnin' up spa bills everyday
Country clibbin' with rich friends
Tomorrow I'll do it all again
You see

Repeat 1

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo, yo
Ayo M dot, him hot, him got
And him cop Benz coupe, him drop
And him got land through Swiss accounts
And him got dough tied around the spouse
And Bleek splurge, cop a couple of furs
A couple of carats, if you want it you can have it
Bleek on chrome, got homes, it's on
No stoppin' me now
This lil nigga in the zone
I dine out, get it poppin' or grind out
Shorty act up, I put her on time out
Relax ma

3 - 	Uh uh uh good life
	Uh uh uh that's right
	Uh uh uh good life
	Uh uh uh I'm livin' that

Repeat 3

Repeat 1 until fade
