[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Yo I park where da crack at
Heads by packs at
Down in Philly
Where my niggas roll crabs at
Pack gats at
Run up in a label
Take a nigga ass cap
You ass cat

[Verse 2: Beani Siegel]
I'm dat kid
Dat'll catch a himmy and post bail
Get locked for another niggas body
Won't tell
Get head from a dime bitch
And won't nail
Bag a dime from a half a brick
Wit no scale

[Vesre 3: Memphis Bleek]
Yo you know where to find me
In da PH. lobby
Two first and Siegel
Niggas know not to try me
Post wit a shotty
Tims on how I be
All blacked out
Hoody on wit da crack out

[Verse 4: Beani Siegel]
You can catch Mac in Marcy
4-5-6ing it
Orange Bo Jackons
New York Knicking it
Durag Nautica sweats
Slaughter da set
Dope spot rushin'
Set up shop on Flushing

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Beanie Sigel]
From my hood to your hood
Yo I got you nigga
From block to your block
Yo I got you nigga
My bitch to your bitch
My hood to your hood
My block to your block
Ayo I got you nigga
From my hood to your hood
Yo I got you nigga
From block to your block
Yo I got you nigga
My bitch to your bitch
My hood to your hood
My block to your block
Ayo I got you nigga

[Verse 4: Beanie Sigel]
Tray snub in da club
Real high when I come through
Layin' blood in da club
You can die if you want to
I stay strapped
Slugged you out
That's how I ride in da jungle
Imagine Mac
"What a Thug About"
Live in da Tunnel

[Verse 5: Memphis Bleek]
I roll up
Philly live
Pearl handle 4-5
Killer
Ginuwine drive
I ride or die
Me and Beanie got front doe
Puttin' in work
And I'm a Brooklyn nigga
Put da semi to work

[Verse 6: Beanie Siegel]
Yeah you know how we play
From PA to BK
Smash and scrape scrape
Stash and break cake
You can feel the steel
Get cut or bust down
Front on tech ball
Smith and Wesson like Buck Town

[Verse 7: Memphis Bleek]
I'm in da 7-6 Jers
Wit twist up herb
Nigga got nerve
Frostbit wit no furs
Chofers
Straight to Philly no turns
Exit Ben Frankiln
To break down da birds

[Chorus: Memphis Bleek & Beanie Sigel]
From my hood to your hood
Yo I got you nigga
From block to your block
Yo I got you nigga
My bitch to your bitch
My hood to your hood
My block to your block
Ayo I got you nigga
From my hood to your hood
Yo I got you nigga
From block to your block
Yo I got you nigga
My bitch to your bitch
My hood to your hood
My block to your block
Ayo I got you nigga
