[King A1]
We are not the same
We are not the same
We are not the same

[Chorus: King A1] x2
Don't compare me to these niggas we are not the same
All I smoke is loud, we don't smoke the same
Two bad bitches with me and they look the same
All I think about is money we don't think the same

[Verse 1: Memphis Bleek]
Don't compare me to these niggas
We are not the same
I want the bread, they want the fame
You know the logo that I stand by
I'm from the borough every day another man die
Just because you travel little homie we don't fly the same
And I know your jeweler so them diamonds you bought not the same
Plus we in the club together, your section don't look the same
I fucked your bitch, can't you tell that ho don't fuck the same?
We might dress the same, but we not alike
I'm authentic street, you the prototype
I made a living out here moving off-white
And you made a living out here nigga off hype

[Chorus: King A1]

[Verse 2: King A1]
Shorty say that I'm the shit I think the same
Ooh she said she love me I don't think the same
Two big blunts, man they look the same
Hustlers get the money, bitch I do the same

[Chorus: King A1]

[Verse 2: Memphis Bleek]
All this comparison, shits embarrassing
You engaged to the game homie I married it
So let the D'Usse overflow the chalices
Whole team gully with more gold than the Vatican
Everybody say they ball, but we all don't play the same
Your Rosé is Moët so this pink bottle don't taste the same
Niggas say they living but your bank account don't say the same
Plus you said you run your hood, but the hood don't feel the same
And niggas said they bought the same car, but the engine different
You got some cylinders missing, I got my ceiling missing
I come through stunting, ain't nothing different though
And I still feel there's no competition ho

[Chorus: King A1]
