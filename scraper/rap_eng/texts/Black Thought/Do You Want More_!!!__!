[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Well, I'm a fly Philly nigga, finger on the trigger
MC's repent from sins, God's comin' again
Original (what?), visionary individual
Original (what?), visionary individual
I proceed, as I give ya what ya need
Like I'm a medical doctor, watch the damage I inflict properly
Ain't nobody risin' on top of me
I be droppin' more plot in my mic, monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder, see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or like Luther says, baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin' on inside my brain is scandalous
No analyst can maintain or handle this
Mind train, yo, I'm on some old snap a rapper neck shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
So, niggas best get out of my path
Kid, I'm on point like a gat
The basket case, I waste MC's with rapture taste
Facin' these leads to cats diminished
They be pullin' the mic out that ass when I get finished
Administrative assistant I'm not, yo, I'm the principal
Nigga, take a shot like I'm invincible
Figure me to be hardcore, my input cuts your jaw
For real, for sure, Do You Want More?!!!??!
