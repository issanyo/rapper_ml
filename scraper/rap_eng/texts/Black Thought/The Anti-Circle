[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm the Anti-Circle
On the mad train like a rain that's purple, I storm
Never comin' twice in one form
The Black'll act a fool and I'm gone
Crumbs, bust it, pass the popcorn (Yeah)
As I kick flavor, behavior abstract, I get recog-nition
But I represent no religion or sect
So, I'm no preacher but I reach your soul 'cause I'm stronger
The younger son of Cassandra, like ganga I grow
From the root, like water I flow
Could sport either the low or the nappy Afro
I still will have the pick 'cause I choose to evict
Derelicts on the tip, tryin' to diss the mad skit, bust a skit
How many licks do it take to make a fake
Realize that he can't shake, bake or penetrate
This style I demonstrate on a regular
Basis and face that he ain't no competitor?
I said it a second ago, yo, I'm the Anti-Circle with the mad style
Crushin' any mental that be fragile
You don't wanna see me get like agile
Rippin' up the scene, screamin' like I was a bad child
Black Thought, so hip that I'm square
The rhythm that you hear is from the kids right over there
The Rubber Band and ?uestion just one step away
Yesterday was a day away, attention you should pay today
To The Roots stickin', boot kickin' with flippa
I lift the party up and y'all get down like a zipper
The mista hippa flippa kid
The one who thinks the music can't be hurtin' a
Rhythm when I get Anti-Circular

[Hook x2]
From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square
From the square to the circle to the square, y'all

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
What you spot up with ya beepers is the creeper
Stompin' on the ground, smokin' a quarter pound reefer
Mr. Five Finger lead singer, noise maker
Number one run, umm, rush, now you must hush!
I crush trail mix with the sandal
Five Fingers keep a candlestick lit when I vandalize
Can't see what I is or will be
Only what I was 'cause I crush an MC (Like Rakim, G)
I'm dandy, happy-go-lucky, don't touch me, don't play me
'Cause I'm not the right one, baby, yeah!
Crazy off-key, never talk softly
Blacker than a bean, still I never sweat coffee
The fourth be followin' the third, word, second after first
Yo, never rehearse a verse that I'm freestylin'
'Cause my verse is diverse, I'm Mr. Versatilin'
Things are easier with oooh, chilin', ya smilin'
Because you dig the way that I deliver
And give a style, flowin' like I was the Nile River, you shiver
'Cause I'm cooler than the coolest, act a fool, it's like a habit
So, yo, this trick is for the rabbit
I grab it and snatch it, inspect it like Gadget
I works the magic, the mic, I must have it
How many kids does the pin on the vibe Tribe
Members do decide to stand around at the sit down?
(Get down!) Can't ya know I'm quick to rip a kid down?
Aim to put wack rappers in containers with the lid down
So, I seal it, can you feel it? Many contacts is caught
On a mad train, the Black Thought

[Hook x2]
