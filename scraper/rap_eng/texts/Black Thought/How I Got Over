[Hook - Dice Raw]
Out on the streets, where I grew up
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
How I got over, where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you, only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets, if you get down on your luck
You can stand out, with a hand out but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets, every man is for himself
They ain't helping no one else, it's a hazard to your health
Living life in these cold streets
Hey, who's worrying about you, babe?
When you wilding out, running around in these streets?

Out on the streets, where I grew up
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

[Verse 2 - Black Thought]
When you on the corners, there's too much drama
Living with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder
We living in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me will make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lying, and too much fighting
I'm all cried out cause I grew up crying
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buying
They trying to convince me that I ain't trying
We uninspired, we unadmired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of living in the hood where the shots are fired
We dying to live, so to live, we dying
You just like I am

[Hook - Dice Raw]
Out on the streets, where I grew up
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

[Verse 3 - Black Thought]
Somebody's gotta care, and I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't trying to go nowhere
Out here in these streets, we're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Living life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find?
Are we running out of time out here?
Listen, hey, who's worrying about you, babe?
When you wilding out, running around in these streets?

[Hook - Dice Raw]
Out on the streets, where I grew up
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
