*scratching* Do it!

[Black Thought]
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
(Repeat 6X)

[Rahzel]
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now witnessing the dopest DJ on the planet...

*scratching over Rahzel beatbox* Do it!

[Black Thought]
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
(Repeat 4X)

*scratching* Do it!

[Black Thought]
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
(Repeat 2X)
