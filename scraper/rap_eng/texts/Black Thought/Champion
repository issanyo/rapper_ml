[Verse 1]
Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up
On a mission so strong that obstacles like failure and loss only act as motivation
I mean like, no one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them

[Verse 1]
When something's telling me to stop, I never do that in the name of love
Until I've given it my all and it just ain't enough
See even if it's getting realer than they say it was
Straighten up, who's afraid of what? Player get involved
Nah, you work hard 'til you're better off
24/7, 365, never off
Look at me, I'm nocturnal, I don't sleep
My eyes heavy, bags and crow's feet
But I won't be stopped I go from tragedy to majesty
The victory has been woven into my tapestry
My adversary's not cut from the same flag as me
That's why the champion's gonna be who it has be
This ain't the type of opportunity that just appeared
I made it here because I shed blood sweat and tears
Forget the title, I forever have my sights on
This is where I become an American Icon

[Hook]
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions

[Verse 2]
Listen, forward motion never fail
I learn to hustle, it's part of a cautionary tail
Hard work is something I know very well
A lesson in a blessing out of each and every L, I ball
I fell in love with the game and never look back
My foundation and frame, they never shook that
Been trailblazing my name into the book that
Represent all the champs who had a chance and took that
And laser focus is the reoccurring theme
Forever coming to me like a reoccurring dream
If we weren't kings, we'd probably be swimming up stream
Tryna make the devil come clean for the umpteenth
You know me as the global dean from the noble team
So convene and the whole regime shall be overseen
I'm a pillar like a column in the Pantheon
Competition I can't see 'em, I'm champion

[Hook]
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions

[Bridge]
I'm gon' prove that I'm the champion
And if there's something I can't do, then it can't be done
And I ain't saying I don't lose, I'm saying I'm the only one
And if it's either I or you, you best believe there's only gon' be one...true champion

[Hook]
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
