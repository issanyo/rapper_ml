The Hypnotic, the Hypnotic, the Hypnotic...

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She dealt with reality, she never fed into the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore Harbor
Alana was a Marilyn, thorough and attractive shorty that's
Relaxed with me and kickin' back with a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed 'cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old-school route
But all of that ceased when that piece checkin' the jewel out
A brother was charged, light a spliff and listen to the DeBarge
Let the shorty hit me with a massage to anoint
Lubricatin' my meridian points
That was the summer, easy to remember
Alana was all up on Tariq agenda; how I used to back-bend her
She even told her best friend Belinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recommend her
But as time flowed on, we grew more mature and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact and slowly parted
Reminiscin' of when it started
It keep me feelin' heavy hearted
A stolen moment, periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though, I wonder if she ever got it, the Hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that persuaded
Beyond bein' infatuated, spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated, I concentrated on how to get in touch with her
'Cause the fact of the matter remain that I miss the Hypnotic

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I would begin to dial her number
But knowin' it's been a while, it's hard to link
I figure, what she'd probably think and soon start to drink
Fightin' the feelin' I'm concealin', apparently at first appealin'
Later revealin' to be deeper, resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mics and puffin' reefer
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin' to touch ya, but only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid Hassan up on his beeper
And asked him if he had a chance to speak to
Jermaine Palmer, whose father's a preacher
To make the story short, me and my man soon ran
Into each other on the humble at a show in San Fran
I said, "Yo, Palmer, when did you last see Alana?"
He offered me a seat in attempts to make me calmer
When he began to break it down, my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber, incredibly crushed
Kinda feelin' on my shoulder that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over, it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get with her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled her
It's all chaotic within my life, it's symbolic
Forever shadow on my mental, I never forgot it
Yo, the psychotic, the Hypnotic
Yo, check it out, the most melodic Hypnotic, yeah
