[Intro]
C'mon, and yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds
Of the legendary, foundation
Yeah, you go
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement

[Hook]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, one, two, one-two one-two
That's how we usually start, once again it's the Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
Black rain fallin from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
Like, a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet
Your head is throbbin and I ain't said shit yet
The Roots crew, the next movement, c'mon!

[Break]
And yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds
Of the legendary, foundation, check it out, uh

[Bridge]
Testin, yo, you go
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement

[Hook]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music

[Verse 2]
Word up, the formation of words to fit
That's what I usually disturb you with
A lot of rappers never heard of this
Or know half the time it is
You doubt the Illa-Fifth, what could you accomplish?
Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous
You be speechless, with stinging sinuses
The Roots royal highnesses through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a diamond kiss
You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin this
I'm the finalist, shinin like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can handle this
Check it out
You, got the groove, emcees
Freeze, stand still, nobody move
Unless you dealin with The Next Movement
The P-Phi-D we be the mon-u-ment
I live my life nice, but I'm not too bent
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't Rent
One hundred percent, straight out the Basement
Spreading this across a planet on some next shit
How many people feelin' this love music? C'mon

[Bridge]
Yo, you go
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement

[Hook]
Word up, we got the hot-hot music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
The hot-hot music music, the hot music
