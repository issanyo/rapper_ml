[Hook]
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

[Verse 1: Malik B]
The rhythm just sways and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and ri-vals who wanna come this way
They better pay attention or a penchant
Not to mention, suspension from the microphone, plus, detention
Trey-eight-o's will vacate those
If there's drama with my henchmen
So, lamp to my man Mussolini
Go get your whole staff, those decaf
'Cause half-and-half's couldn't cream me
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Mannn, transss-gressin, you'll catch lead I, crushin'
Poundin' on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
I styles with my vocabulary
The Roots, the one you call your ultra adversary
Now, you're all desert 'cause I'mma serve ya like a tray
To meet your doom, Malik's the broom, so you get swept awayyyy

[Hook]
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, hello everybody, do I need introduct?
I be the mic mercenary, very un-clear to your ear
The exquisite pattern that you hear
Is known to be Black Butta Baby
Crazy cardiac, my attack on any fat rhythm
That I capture, kid, I snatch the mic from tykes
While I proceed and continue to tend to
Business 'cause this is, how I do
I'm insane and go against the grain like [?]
Never on no nigga dick 'cause I'm just too hip
Plus, I rest where niggas pack and never act other than ill
Shit is real in Phy-double
So, if you want trouble, let's stomp
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues, while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away

[Hook]
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away
MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

[Outro]
There's somethings goin' on
Because there's somethin' goin' on, on
Yeah, something's goin on
Yeah, something's goin' on, on
Y'all know there's somethin' goin'
Because there's somethin' goin' on, on
She knows there's somethin' goin' on
Yeah, somethin' goin' on, on
Y'all know there's somethin' goin' on
Yeah, something's goin' on
Because there's somethin' goin' on
Yeah, y'all know what's goin' on
