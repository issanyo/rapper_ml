[Hook: Black Thought]
It looks like another one's comin' around
It looks like another one's comin' around
It looks like another one's comin' around
So the Black Thought gots to get down y'all, yeah
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *
It looks like another one's comin' around
It looks like another one's comin' around
It looks like another one's comin' around
So The Square Roots gotta get down, bust it

[Verse 1:  Black Thought]
Yo, I wrote this, basement, Never Never Tunnels type portion
Just to accompany some audio distortion
Bust the popcorn, drop it onto my cassette and
Bust it, Kid Crumbs, how ya feel? (I'm feelin blessed man)
Yeah, The Square Roots be the setters of examples
Findin' rhythm in the static of your samples
Makin you move to the groove as we sooth
The ear of the listener on the musical
Prisoner G, now you're free you can be all you wanna be
Go where you want or go and see all you wanna see
Because yo, your ambitions I won't neglect
And to the brothers who ain't here, nuff respect
So BROther ?uest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?
To me the brother with the linens and the applejack;
Busy til the break of dawn
The first verse is poured I pass the popcorn

[Chorus: Black Thought]
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
So the Black Thought had to get down y'all, yeah
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
?uestion would you come and get down, bust it, c'mon

[Verse 2: ?uestlove]
Check it out, secondly
It's me the BROther ?uest from the S-Q-T (Square Roots)
And he's Black Thought, the boy you know is (FUNKY)
The rhythms I recycle sometimes prehistoric
The mic for the popcorn's like it's metaphoric (metaphoric baby)
So many different factors in the ?uestion's style
A rhythmic father and I'm givin more than one child
Abstract soloist drummin' from the heart
All the way from Philly, from the West part
Relax your mind and let your body be at rest
Flow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest
Now the second verse has been pourn
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *

[Chorus: Black Thought]
It looks like another one comin around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
?uestion ripped the set and got down baby, yeah
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Kid Crumbs would you come and get down, c'mon

[Verse 3: Kid Crumbs]
Blessed is the next at the second still before the 4th is passed
I'm gassed off the edible raps, and that's illegible
Tommy used to bug, when I come around
Screamin' at the top of my lungs -- you gots to get down
Now, they heard the sound and wanna give the kid a pound
On the down low *Relax baby, keep it underground yo*
From the crown of knotty hair that I wear to the funk feet
Wonder why the sisters dig the brother missin' five teeth
Peace I gots to rock so pass the popcorn and shit
Quick to lick a shot to umm, Wheezy, and Cricket
Used to kick it in the house until I got myself evicted
Now The Crumbs is restricted to the popcorn, elected
From The Roots, I griff the rest and share the stash of popcorn
Back to Black Thought, rock on (and on)
And on (and on) and on (and on)
And on (and onnnnnn), pass the popcorn!
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *

[Black Thought]
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Kid Crumbs ripped the set and got down Baby Pah!
* in background: "Pass the what? (Pass the popcorn)" 4X *
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
It looks like another one comin' around
Black Thought, you know I gotta get down, bust it, yo

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
Honey, glazed, amazed at the art Black Thought dis-plays
I get mad props and the compliment pays
Makin me more funky and it shows on stage
Word right BROther cause I'm goin through a phase
I wanna be a pioneer so trails I blaze
Straight past the days when I used to be enslaved
But don't eat all the popcorn BROther ?uest (What?)
Yo BROther ?uest say it
A bit for my hit makin' it legitimate and give
Credit to the attitude you set it don't forget well it's
Gotta be live, cause that's the way I'm rockin it and
Pop-corn is in my pocket then I guess it's rockin yo
The S-Q-T'n, Black Thought of seeing
I know you're all agreeing, I'm rocking and I'm being
Ripping another chapter, just for you to clap ta
To the sounds of vexed I make you step just like a camper
I pass, the popcorn, the mix I drop on the mic
Gon', have you hummin' my song, all the way home
It's cool and as long, as you and the song, be mellowin' out
Together cause it's kind of peace I'm not embarrassed
As I pass the popcorn, and get off the dome
Yo BROther ?uestion, yo Rubber Bandz Square Roots
Take it home
