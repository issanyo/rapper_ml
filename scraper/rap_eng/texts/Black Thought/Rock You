[Hook]
Rock you {*repeat 6X*}
Come on {*repeat 2X*}

Aiyyo y'all rappers less played, what I'm about to say
Will probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and I've been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzin off the chillest suspense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aimin straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments
Mad vocabulist, yes I must confess
I'm like Diddy tryin to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that it's Black you can tell he a vet
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split
It's Black coming, you can tell it's a hit
Comin to drop you nigga

[Hook]
We will Rock you {*repeat 6X*}

Yo yall savages is primitive, I'm true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rap hypnotist
Making sound waves, prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent dope distributors
Man, I remain miles ahead of the game
Slang play off the meter cause it's never the same
Niggas tell me how they never comin better than plain
They love what I say, here come the rebel breaking the frame
And the charts too, my earning bars arts is martial
I'm comin to off you, I ain't tryin to argue
When you least expect it I'm gonna step out the darkroom
Pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice, I spit nice
Fucking around this twice as much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one the noose or the gun
Cause you're getting banged or hanged, Thought second to none
Nigga

[Hook]

Yo check it out whether you ballin or just on the
Wall and groovin groovin
We've come to get it kickin and get the movement movin
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin
Remember your development with melanin music
Spit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mic as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money ain't no need for makin excuses
Burn you fuckin with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro then cut your fro off
I been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word

I will rock you {*repeat 2X*}
