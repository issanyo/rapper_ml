If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me
If you were worried bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before until I'm overseas on tour
And peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter when I get home get at her
Through letter, phone whatever, let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop and keep telling me

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol

[Eve]
...Another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper Daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playing boo, you know it's just wit you I'm staying boo
And when cats be popping game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leaving you blind

[Black]
Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?

[Eve]
Is you crazy, you my king for real

[Both]
But sometimes relationships get ill

[Eve]
No doubt

[Hook: Jill Scott]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering she trying to play you for the fool Black
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some oh I'm a celebrity
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like
