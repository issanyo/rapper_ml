[Verse 1: Nneka]
You say you are feeling me
Camouflage killing me
Civilization to the extent of imprisoning me
Freedom is what you speak
Your god, is whom I seek
For all you have, you have because someone else grief
Impose your lies on me nothing is left of me
A living dead to function in your own reality
In my head, I picture paradise, Jehovah and the antichrist
These are the end of the days
Your footprints engraved in the pavement of a demonic ways
Pump me with your drug, so I can't feel me
Take back all your love, for you have deceived me
You compete with god

God knows why
Only god knows why
Oh god knows why God knows why

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Black boy like Richard Wright
I am just a product of a different type of living life
I am just a public enemy that don't believe the hype
I am from the jungle,where some people never see the light
I guess we nocturnal, black fire flies
Might burn you a while I serve you with the diatribe
I got this message to to deliver to the riot squad
Just to let them know I answer to a higher god
Self style, man child in the promise land
Staring like a child soldier on a sonogram
He is in a feeble position
Bow and needle precision, it is destiny it was writen

God knows why
Only god knows why
Oh god knows why God knows why

[Verse 3: Nneka]
Turn the stone into bread,in the wilderness I hunger
Give me more of it for my lust goes far, eyonda (after life)
I stole the apple of wisdom, I now see I am naked
I have no shame, I have made love, I am no longer sacred
Burn the incense, pray to the sun, pay is intense,and so I lie I mourn
What is love, where is love, who is love, is it god? whatever
Where is god in this world of deceit? would we find
Would we ever defeat, the dark is in the heart of mankind
The black in it
