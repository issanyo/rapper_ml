[Hook x2]
He said yeah
You better come out with your hands up
We got you surrounded
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said blink, we gonna send the hounds in
I said wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Uh. I'm soul brother one hunted
How much charisma could another one stomach?
If I be the prisoner then I wasn't more cunning or wise
If I come outside I'm not running
Stone lone wolf of the pack, the unwanted
I really got nothin to hide, I'm bout cuttin
Go out in a blaze, wouldn't pop one button
I'm a murk half hurt leave the cop dogs huntin
The pretty black one in the group
The smooth villain under fire
Cause I'm pennin the words that move millions
Slide right in front of your eyes true brilliance
It's a new bad moon on the rise, who feelin it
New true skill in it, y'all the roots still in it
Ready plus willin it's all the true killer shit
You know we got them involved, we too diligent
They say the music is strong and too militant

[Hook]
He said yeah
You better come out with your hands up
We got you surrounded
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said blink, we gonna send the hounds in
I said wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come

[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Yo, Black Inc, raw life in this what-you-might-call-it
Weed smokin junkie alcoholic
One foot in the grave, one foot in the toilet
Still I'm onstage, in front of an audience
Disturbing the peace, and the local ordinance
This pimp shit popping, I need coordinates
My ETA, I'll arrive by morning
Money long like the arms on Alonzo Mourning
Vampire chicks suck blood, dusk to dawnin
Waitin to catch me sleep but I'm not yawnin
They in the VIP at the garden
They gon jump me when I stop performing
I got something for them behind the organ
I always roll deep with my squadron
The sheriff out front gonna sic the dogs in
That nigga talkin bout he got warrants

[Hook]
He said yeah
You better come out with your hands up
We got you surrounded
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said blink, we gonna send the hounds in
I said wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come

[Verse 3: Malik B]
I'm in the darkness, heartless, fuck you regardless
Move with hardness, y'all just pressin charges
It's often injury, floss and force my entry
This peninitentiary, knockin' up niggas for centuries
It's elementary, like KRS and evidently
Incidents they all stress, I'm lawless
That's my problem, evolve and never solve them
Chill in Harlem, bang you, bring you stardom
You full of boredom, bastard you been aborted
Bring your neck out, Bring the tec' out, absorb it
See you check out, and then step out the orbit
Blow your flesh out till I'm fresh out my torment
Street apostle, pop shit, preach the Gospel
Still I'm hostile, sippin' a duece when possible
Turn into a monster, grouchy, gimme the Oscar
Hit you like vodka, then screech off in a Mazda

[Hook x2]
He said yeah
You better come out with your hands up
We got you surrounded
I'm in the back, changing my outfit
He said blink, we gonna send the hounds in
I said wait, cause here I come
Here I come, here I come
You boys get ready
Cause here I come, here I come
Here I come
