[Verse 1: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Words: Rainbow; Pancake; Slam Dunk)]
Microphone check
What is this?
I fly my rainbow flag
LGBTQ business
Oh yes, I've got so much love to give
I look at the colors, it's like ROYGBIV
Aw, started from the bottom like my man Drake
I fly in it, flour, eggs, like a pancake
And aw yeah, I bring any star you brung out
I slam dunk like Michael Jordan with his tongue out
Like ahhh

[Verse 2: Black Thought (Words: Mars; Hot Pocket; Channing Tatum)]
My man Riggs is VP of A and Rs
He discovered new flows like on the planet Mars
I steal the show like the man at large
My band royal like the Kansas City Tenenbaums
Keeping 30 Rock popping, you cannot stop 'em
Prob'ly got your mommy out there pop-lockin'
I pull up in the whip, that's the top rocket
These rappers in they fillings like a hot pocket
Ayo, I'm glad you hating
Congratulations from Thornton to Puerto Rican imagination
Yo, go get your vaccination
'Cause all the chicks dig me like I'm Channing Tatum

[Verse 3: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Words: Dinosaur; Pumpkin Pie; Darth Vader)]
Whoa, hope I do not fall flat
I'm walking through Jurassic World like my name's Chris Pratt
Aw, I'm like The Roots, do you want more?
I go from the Mesozoic, Triassic like a dinosaur
Ah, yeah, I got that pumpkin pie
Oh my gosh, I can't fake the funk 'cause I'm that funking guy
Ah, and I would give you all slices
Resurrect, resolve Puerto Rico's debt crisis
Ah, but yes, please, I'll see you later
I have y'all leavin' hard and breathin' hard
Like my name's Darth Vader
So please don't bother
I'm behind the mask sayin'
"Luke, I am your father."
