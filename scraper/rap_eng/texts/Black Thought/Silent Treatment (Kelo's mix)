[Hook: Marsha Morrison]
Touch me, tease me, I want you please me
Control me body, caress me, undress me
Touch me, tease me, I love how you please me
Control me body, caress me, undress me
You know me need some groove, it make me feel nice
You know how to move, it make me feel right
Me love it when you hold me, ease away, outta sight
When you are done, I am fine for the rest of the night

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
First, she said all she want is love and affection
5'7" caramel complexion
I met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
And been diggin' her ever since
When it's commenced, she called me her chocolate brother
And I called her my sugar sister, coolin' out and puffin' L's with her
That's why I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin' the script
Like, "Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin' to hit, I could quit speakin'
Tariq, in fact, you bein' Black Thought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed to
Most of them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava
It's not sweat like that, Black, I'll catch ya later"
I contemplated and then concluded she was bluffin'
I anticipated gettin' nothin' but The Silent Treatment

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Nothin' but frustration in my lovin' situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin'
I want some Marvin Gaye healin', feelin' is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied
I'd love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my shorty call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin' and sexually neglectin'
Sayin' I was too complex and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skin and I'm into women
Because of that, this one's endin' communication
Temptation played the vandal, flippin' my brain, my mind
Rippin' the handle on physically scandalous acts, yo
She knew what I wanted but she fronted
The Silent Treatment

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
As I continue on with the song and the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby, bust the message I send
Ain't no need to pretend, it's all real 'til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times and livin' trife
While I open ya mind, I'm in ya life like love
It ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
But still, I'm feelin' like you're makin' me bug
I puff an L on fifty-deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin' killer pain while I hop on the train
Dial the number to the rest and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thump from stress, yo, it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, frontin' or no guessin'
Undressin', caressin' in the span that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game, now, who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggas with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know
