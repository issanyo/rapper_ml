[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I’m what you would call a, warrior and a scholar
From where the root of the matter is pursuit of the dollar
There’s godfathers in your zone, keep it real partner
Y’all niggas know when I grab the mic it’s Pearl Harbor
Don’t ever worry mine
Who getting fetti everyday is legendary time
It’s on tap like Savion or Gregory Hines, Fiji, or Evians
Rappers as funny as one of them Tyler Perry lines
The title of the [reefer disciple’s?] forever mine
Y’all niggas into the smoking Tarragon marathon
Whatever y’all twist up, I got the better kind
That’s the Tom and Jerry kind – this is the heavy kind
We getting paper, yes I’m the black Ben Stein
In sheep’s clothes with a killer on the inside
The Jam Boys coming out the 21-5
My squad of Mumra, vaporize dumb guys

[Verse 2: Truck North]
Yo, one of the illest alive I’m not lying
And I can turn day into night without trying
All star, all in the paper, no hyphen
Lifestyles and trials of the rich and trifling
And I’m a Viking, big bad wolf
Niggas taking all the money, now they asking for the books
A big gun had Red Robin Hood shook
She like “call King Cole, they finna pull a jooks”
But I’m so juxtaposed, I didn’t even look
I mean I’m here then I’m there, tortoise and the hare
Early bird gets the worm, slow and steady wins the race
No heaven when there’s hell to pay, fast never late
North side of Cannon doing 80 like I’m Gene Chandler
Too fast for most residents to handle
Jam Boys show up lit with no candles
And gamble like Kenny, the money leave with me, bitch

[Verse 3: Dice]
Nigga, I’m on a guest list, you on my checklist
Deaths on my tongue, for all rappers is my message
And make no mistake, hell doesn’t wait you
You reaching heaven’s doors will be a true breakthrough
A fucking miracle, something so spiritual
I signed with the devil, so fuck it here we go
Hit you with a brick when you pour your morning Cheerios
Life’s a game, scoreboard read zeerio
Mine says a milli, these new rappers they from
Parts unknown, nigga I’m from North Philly
I know Beanie Sigel, Cassidy, I know Gillie
I know Young C, Peedi, Free, I know ‘em really
So when you say you don’t know Dice, you sound silly
I even know Jazzy Jeff and Big Willie
Cool C, EST, Scholly D, YG, OG you all know me
