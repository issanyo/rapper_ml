[Black Thought]
Embracin' the cylinder can
Obeyin' my thirst command when it's too much to withstand
'Cause, man, summer got me in a pool
I sweat, time to rearrange this whole set and get cool
I'm on the brink, thinkin' I need a chill drink to replenish
Then will drink Sprite until it's finished
Relaxin' the mind, takin' off the summer edge
In emergencies, first obey what ya thirst says
