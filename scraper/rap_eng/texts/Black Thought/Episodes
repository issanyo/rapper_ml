[Hook: Jazzyfatnastees & Black Thought]
Yeah, you in tune to another episode in my area code
Better believe it
All sorts of episodes in my area code
'Cause it is comin'
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
It's just an episode in my area code
It's another episode in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
All sorts of episodes in my area code
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
Where the blocks explode, ride strapped and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, just push the panic button on your remote control
Then enter the zone where I patrol this wicked realm called soul
Diddly Bo, leave her feelin' a saga foretold
Who got caught 'pon the block for gold, got the old heads froze
They peepin' outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed, I watched it all unfold
Witness another episode, with titanic panoramic view
As this manic-depressant un-load with this gung-ho
Wild like a son sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash, crack for ass
Entire crews pass, not makin' the news flash
Brews past a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever Ave. transform to the war path
Pure wrath from North down to 24th and Task
Game slaughtered half the niggas you acquainted with
Streets tainted with camouflage, guerilla sabotage
My cousins Jarette and Todd was livin' type large
Got caught then blast, crashed off on Broad and Lombard
So many so-called hearts scarred, they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon, de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick-up kids is jumpin' outta plated Dodge Rams
To jam you and your man, it's mad drama and...

[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
This is for all of my niggas that are R.I.P.'s
You ain't missin' nothin', life ain't what it should be
I'll pass across soon, you know who's the enemy
Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Tauseen? Nigga thinks life's a dream
Go out fast for the buck, do anythin' for the cream
Never seen a case like this, although it's quite contagious
He even got his little brother actin' all outrageous
From dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk
They do anythin' and everythin' tryin' to come up
It's kinda sickenin' how the cash is so fuckin' addictive
And when I say son wild, they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
'Cause the loot is for the takin', and not for the givin'
Then the youngest one will say "I'mma die hustlin'
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in"
I guess the young boy just did not know the truth
'Cause the followin' week, Tauseen' threw him off the roof
And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whacked for somethin' less than a pack
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
Thought he was his brother's keeper, but fuck all that
Niggas causin' mayhem from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s
America's worst nightmare: guns in kids' hands

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Malik B]
It was the year of '84, I was tryin' to get in the mix
The year when niggas rolled with sheepskins, gazelles and kicks
Even got the patent-leather Adidas snatched off your feet
Man, that talk is cheap, the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first stoge was rolled to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties in search for Cinderella
Was just a little man, real bold
Tryin' to act grown and old so that respect'll be shown
A hip-hop, a little bop and the break-dancin'
When niggas wore windbreakers, plot to take lambskins
Remember Zigglers? Uptown, the bottom's not quite the same
St. Charles in South Phil, the Ooh Mob gang
H-R-M Ogontz Ave., Brickyard to Hollow
Niggas was snatchin' gazzeles and flippin' pockets for the dallo
You wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort, we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot or bodies in chalk
Aggravated assault, another weekend in the precinct
Takin' everybody for a vic, man, that's how we think
Back then, you'd catch a sucker-punch off-guard
Niggas would pull your card, tryin' to walk around all hard
Niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip-service
When you see fifteen niggas deep with scullys, get nervous
It ain't no tellin' what they could do to you
So, you clutch up, thinkin' and knowin' you gettin' stuck up
In another episode in my area code, episode in my area code

[Outro: The Jazzyfatnastees]
Better believe it, 'cause it is comin'
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
You won't believe the sight you see before your eyes
Better believe it, 'cause it is comin'
