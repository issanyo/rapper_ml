[Pre-Chorus: Stephen Marley]
We come from so far, and life is full of surprises
Just know I'll never change, no i’ll never change
No matter the circumstances, though this road can be demanding
I’ll always be the same, always be the same
Never lose sight of who you are, temptation comes from near and far
Wounds heal but leave a scar
Make sure from the start, its from your heart

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose
Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose

[Verse: Black Thought]
Yo
We're all products of the same stem, same blood, and same skin
Same ghetto flower growing from the same pavement
Rising to the challenge of this world and trying to stay in it
Paying tears and sweat, paying dues and paying rent
Never shall I stumble I stay on the same wavelength
Yeah the game is savage yo it’s primitive its cavemen
Only way to save men and free them from enslavement
Start to over stand each other like a native language
Guiding one another down this road full of changes
Although its full of dangers we got to be courageous
Let the vibes spread and make your bravery contagious
Know you’re going through the same book but different pages
People can be so vain, hustling can be so pain-ful
And make you feel like all you do is work for no gain
But before it bottles up the flames like propane
Inhale and exhale, no stress and no strain

[Chorus]
