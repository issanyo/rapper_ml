[Verse 1:]
Every day is another day
When we let ourselves get away with murder
And the only crime we’re charged with is love
And we need to say what we need
Cause we ain’t getting any younger
And I’m right here
So send me a sign

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don’t have anywhere to be tonight
Think about it, it could be just you and I
Cause you’re the only one that’s worth more than time
So send me the sign

[Verse 2:]
Time drifts away
Leaving only footprints in the sand
Would you love me now, or slip right through these hands?
But before it rains, there’s always a little thunder
And you’re my umbrella
So send me a sign

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don’t have anywhere to be tonight
Think about it, it could be just you and I
Cause you’re the only one that’s worth than time
So send me a sign

[Pre-Chorus?:]
On and on, we were meant to be
On and on, like a memory
Will it be our destiny?
Will it be just you and me?
On and on, we were meant to be
On and on, like a memory
Will it be our destiny?
So send me a sign

[Chorus:]
'Cause I don’t have anywhere to be tonight
Think about it, it could be just you and I
Cause you’re the only one that’s worth than time
So send me a sign

[Bridge:]
From a place that's never been depicted on a map
A space where emptiness and substance often overlap
We had potential that it seemed impossible to tap
To pass the future form the loop that couldn't hold us back
Some of us look for love as if it's fallen off its course
But love had only been obscured at times when we were lost
And sadly I'd already had what I was reaching for
And think that it was mi amor that I was keeping warm
But we belong where we belong and stand a lot to lose
So all is keepin' on and creepin' on along is not the move
Though I wish everyone could win somebody's got to lose
Give me a sign so I am not confused
Because if gang war is what you came for
Shorty, what you playing for?
Take them things off, throw on some Serge Gainsbourg
I used to tell myself I'd never be a savior
This thing is more than misbehavior, it's really a crime

[Chorus] [x2]
'Cause I don’t have anywhere to be tonight
Think about it, it could be just you and I
Cause you’re the only thing that’s worth than time
So send me a sign, send me a sign

'Cause I don’t have anywhere to be tonight
Think about it, it could be just you and I
Cause you’re the only thing that’s worth than time
So send me a sign, send me a sign, send me a sign
