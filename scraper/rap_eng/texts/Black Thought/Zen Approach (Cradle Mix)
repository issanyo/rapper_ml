Line for line, you gotta get it done

Little at a time, Zen approach

Gradually, I'ma get mine

Black Thought from the legendary 5th don

You wasn't payin attention

I'm henchin to hit the entrance

Trenchin it was no means to intervention

A dollar bill would make a hundred ten yen, son

How much you willing ta sacrifice ta win, huh?

I personally I paid mines

And then some climbed up an inch bit at a time

Now who's the zen one

If not self whom else can you depend on?

Friends gonna say it's alright and probably they been wrong

I got them battlefield dents in my armor

A twitch from the drama

The trees and bad karma

But still I'm precision, proceedure performer

We operate every night, and leave in the morning

Ta getchoo high as a kyte's the reason you want it

It's like a direct flight from freezin ta burnin hot shit

The audience fiend fa this fix

And KRUSH come wit the guillotine fa this mix, like...

Line for line, you gotta get it done

Little at a time, Zen approach

Gradually, I'ma get mine

Black Thought from the legendary 5th don

Yo, who got they fingers on the carousel locked in position

It got to be my man, the turntable tactician

You all at hush cause I ain't try to listen

You wanna feel its realness, the Rik's spittin

It gotcha head split your eyes can't stop twitchin

The only thing that you can do is rock the rythm

Don't put em down

Cause see the world we're at now

See me lickin rhymes, rappin like a five of rounds

And a you now ain't true to find the zenfinite sound and a

The revolution poppin off right now

I make you rase your fist, raisin up right

Raise your fist that busted the flag like blahhh

The f**k boy nigga's trying ta keep it on the hush

But Black Thought spittin cause the people want a rush your feel

It's what the audience fiend fa this fix

And KRUSH come wit the guillotine fa this mix lie...

Line for line, you gotta get it done

Little at a time, Zen approach

Gradually, I'ma get mine

Black Thought from the legendary 5th don

Yo, I got the renissance, turn of the century

Choked + I'ma do the people right

If y'all gimme the vote

Finna ride, hang em high

KRUSH, gimmie the rope

See all them porcelain chin

Niggas gettin em broke

One at a time, na let's focus on who the don

When your blade's sharp as mine

People want you to rhyme

They want you ta spill

Fa me ain't nuttin for real

Me and my man runnin Japan

We're tough on the wheel

He blow ya mind like bustin the steel

I give the crowd something ta feel

The sound got the power to heal

It's like the Green Mile, now I need an hour to chill

A 1/4 of a kill ta burn while patrillin the field

I'm puttin rappers out cold

I done rap from Tokyo to the North Pole

Whenever my man program the passcode

Drummers se the 5th

And yo, KRUSH come wit a gullotine fa this mix, like...

Line for line, you gotta get it done

Little at a time, Zen approach

Gradually, I'ma get mine
