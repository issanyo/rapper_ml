[Hook - Dice Raw]
We coming
Coming out hard
We coming
Coming out hard
We coming
Coming out hard
We coming

[Verse 1 - Truck North]
Knocking at your door, who is it?
You know it ain't the cops, they don't knock this vicious
Drama at your door that could pop it off the hinges
Northside, hi, I'm here to pay your broad a visit
Talk it while I live it
And due to the heat, most flee from the kitchen
I don't leave for a minute
That's why I'm so immersed in the verse
It's like I spent a few lifetimes on rehearse
As bad goes to worse, like an ambulance to hearse
Niggas pray I won't find them, so I'm headed to the church
Paper like a file clerk, all a nigga wants
So the work that I does gets them all on the nuts
Homes I've been ? since the pre-game
I'm Einstien to pea brains
Me to them is like a stab wound to bee stings
Blowin' killa, drinkin' abstenith seein things
Cold lay a sucka down like a box spring

[Bridge: Dice Raw]
Fuck the bullshit, and all facades
Never fear man, only fear God
Spare my words but never spare the rod

[Hook:]

[Verse 2 - Black Thought]
Check it out
The following is paid programming
Presented by the leader of them ice-cold cannons
We putting out another life-long anthem
I'm singing ya'll the news kind of like slow jamming
Blood on the palate of the black jack pollock
The ballot of the last rock solid, soul-tronic
Yo, either you got it or you don't got it
Withdraw or deposit, to the satchel in the closet
It's logic a penny saved is a penny earned
Ya'll niggas looking plenty lazy so give me yearn
Before the acid reflux from the semi burn
It's the Money Making Jam Boys with the grand return
Ain't nothing changed, I'm deranged and I'm hostile
Thinking about emcees, nowadays, laughing out loud
They got me feeling like a stranger of my style
Product of that Krush Groove, Beat Street and Wild Style

[Hook:]

[Verse 3 - STS]
Kush keep me level headed, pussy keep me on my job
Mushing with my dogs so win it all like the Iditarod
Symbol like a synagogue, I don't want your demi-god
Take me to your leader, got the heater to your head nod
I smoke the green glob, Jam Boy mean mob
Clip paper trip, joint looking like a bean-pod
Yeah, you know the team's hot, Shawn on them bitches
Money making in the moniker, the name of our business
Listen, pay attention this that illadelph rendition
Of that baller G shit, whatchu' know about it pimpin'
That's that Cadillac, wood grain, candy paint dripping
On the slow southern leaning, gold Dayton, lane switching
They ain't see the vision of me revving up the engine
A nigga coming harder than a head on collision
Mack truck, verse a prism when I'm smoking that forbidden
Consider this fair warning from the Jam Boy commission, niggas

[Bridge:] + [Hook:]

[Verse 4 - Dice Raw]
I use your girlfriend's ass for an 808
Then a second-story window for my great escape
I'm a Taurus, my chinese zodiac is the snake
They feed me hate, yeah, they like to slop it on my plate
I eat it up, and then I shit in everybody's face
These new rappers' voice sounding faint
And I be screaming at the top of my lungs when I hear something fake
I love hip hop, but I dream of killing the whole race
Say what it do, I say get the fuck out my face
My names Dice, yeah, my heart's like a block of ice
And my thoughts, scary like the Poltergeist
My life, told in the next Zeitgeist
Living the high life, every man's got his
And I got my price, definitely high price
I'm in the lime light, large beyond hype
Sight beyond sight, problems on sight

[Bridge:] + [Hook:]
