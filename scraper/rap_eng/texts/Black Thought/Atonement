[Hook: Jack Davey]
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment
Feelin like I can't control it
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment

[Verse: Black Thought]
Uh-huh, feelin the steam from the cauldron
With tension runnin deep as the ocean
Many are called, but so few are chosen
As I go through the motions, of medication uppin my dosage
Bangin Earth, Wind & Fire "Devotion" as I admire the focus
Takin the city with a grain of salt
Where they tastin foul, chase it down, with the latest malt - liquor
Roll and hit it, knife did it, hope you got some smarts wit'chu
Hope you got some heart it ain't no stoppin when it start - nigga
Feel somethin bigger got a hold on me
And I ain't trippin not a Bobby Brown, lippin with my nose runnin
Basically I had two, options I just chose one
And then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted
Coast to coast, from L.A. to Chicago
Now I'm faced, with the weight of survival, plus the taste
From the way I been lied to while the preacherman spittin his gospel
I can win if I try to

[Hook: Jack Davey]
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment
Feelin like I can't control it
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment
