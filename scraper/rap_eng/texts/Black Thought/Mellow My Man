[Intro: Black Thought]
One two
Yes, The Roots layin back, rela-xin
Coolin out with my man Malik B
We call him Sla-xon
YaknowhatI'msayin? We in effect
Mode like Al B. Sure, for your plea-sure
Aiyyo bust it
We about to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip
We gon' set it like this
Yo check it

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those afro picks, with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin like John the Baptist, it's
The cause of that "Oh shit!"
The skits I kick, flows like catfish
And got many emcees on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach
Offender wanna go like Meshach, Black
Thought the nappy cat a bookworm shoot styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand
Of my mellow my man, Malik B

[Verse 2: Malik B]

Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower
The pro-fessional, best in those skills that kills so uhh..
WHOA, slow down before you go down (sissy)
Trixie this is Agatha Christie - you're slain and know now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote, when he croaks
They sayin -- isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms
(And we're in, your neighborhood) on the norms
Capture, was to, whack ya
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it SLAM
For my mellow my man

[Hook: Black Thought]
The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No no we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Yo, I got spunk, plus funk And Jump Like Punks, to Get
Beat Down Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool
Deeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt Damn near drowned in
Clowns bounce to sound when Thoughts pound and brown's
My complexion section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, cause this kid gets
Grits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip dup damn
Yo I lost it but
Back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked, by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik B

[Verse 4: Malik B]
WHOAHHHHH, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks (uh-huh)
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats (say what?)
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust them
Even though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices
Twice this nice with sugar and spices
I won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hypocrites
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, that ain't *shhh*
It was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin the wrath
Of Malik, ayo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome
And then we cap, YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check
For my mellow my man

[Hook: Black Thought]
The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No no we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man

[Outro: Black Thought]
I think it's for my mellow my man, uhh
My mellow my man, right
My mellow my man, uhh
My mellow my man, right
My mellow my man, uhh
My mellow my man, right
My mellow my man my mellow my man my mellow my man my mellow my man
For Scott Storch, my mellow my man
Leonard Hubbard on the bass, my mellow my man
Brother question on the drums, my mellow my man
Gotta end it on the one, my mellow my man
Check it
