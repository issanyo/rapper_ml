[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I'm from the land of them straight razor face beard niggas
With hammers on their waist, yeah, waste weird niggas
And erase scared niggas, them snake head niggas
That take care of niggas who don't break bread with us
Niggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas
Brown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas
No tellin' when the bullet comin', be prepared niggas
Cause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas
That's everywhere niggas
Am I the muthafuckin' legendary
Yeah niggas, make it very clear niggas
Been looking at y'all in my rearview
Mirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas
I'm the debonair nigga, a bear taking more than my share
Lookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga
Neither is a bald eagle with a hair trigger
Haystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga
Leave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet
That don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga
I'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga
I'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga
I am such a rare nigga, you in a battle telling
Me you not ready like you figured I'mma bear with you
I don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds
Of the money making jam trillionaires nigga
Gentlemen of an extraordinary league
You never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
What I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed
Your boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry
As a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green
We tried to launder the cash and never came clean
So now I'm in the story with all the cats before me
And smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame
The train to the bus, then another dang plane
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint; I'm a modern day king
My definition I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feelin' like a million dollars in my hand
It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your Zanny, Percocet, Percodan
What's your networking plan? you better look alive
Cause them niggas outside lookin' desperate again nigga
And the blunts and liquor killin' our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spittin' played out patterns that once was hittin'
I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall, I ain't heard of that
Y'all niggas is off the wall like Arsenio Hall
I'mma put you right back where the dirt is at
450 fahrenheit on the thermostat
Somebody starvin' like a white girl, Bernadette
But she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work
For Nat Burner yet, the black microphone murder vet
I'm in a class of my own
If I got beef with you, you the last one to know
I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already international-able
I done twirled in Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothin' can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringin' what them niggas can't bring
My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffle I'm gone
Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on
Just a pawn steppin' right into the head of the storm
You been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate
I'm a rebel, renegade must stay paid
