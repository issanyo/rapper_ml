[Hook x2]
Girl you know that you need
To stop giving me the silent.. treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I had a queen named Amina, height 5'7"
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man, Big Vince
Like something from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brother, I call her my sugar sister
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flipping and shit
Like, "Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep trying to hit I could quit speaking
Tariq in fact, you bein Black Thought don't get you closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed to
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flavor
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya"
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffing
Steady pursuing screwing, getting nothing but the silent treatment

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Crazy frustration, about my loving situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waiting
I want some Marvin Gaye healing, feeling is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd
Love to get with it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my queen gets upset, rejectin and sexually neglect
Then sayin I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinning
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into
Communication, temptation played the vandal
Freaking my brain, my mind ripping the handle on physically scandalous
Acts, yo, she knew what I wanted, but she fronted
(Bust it)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Well umm
Moving right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real 'til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And living trife, while I open your mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above
What's real, that's why I'm feeling like you're making me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feeling killer pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no fronting or no guessing
Undressing, caressing, in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a ho for niggas with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know
