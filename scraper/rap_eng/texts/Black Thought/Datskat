[Hook x4]
Datskat!
I know you dig it when I kick it, baby!

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Di-bi-dis-banks, hip-flip-a-didip-didim-dow-hound
You wonder 'bout the sweat pon my brow, formulatin' nouns
I'll get down, boogie brother rock on, right on, right on
The brown rhymer organically grown, I've shown, while
Sip-pida-didip-styles and proceed, to flow
You know I'm flyer than G.I. so yo Joe
Fuck, I run amuck 'cause I'm the father of the fattest skatter
Black is intellectual, cat that is perpetually
Ritually catchin' wreck, don't step, I cut ya
I mix the Sector 6 and now I knowledge butter words
To prop up Afrika Bambaataa, a lotta brothers is out there
Waitin' on that new shit, well, this is how we do, kid
The levels is correct, one-two, call in a blunt, too
The front two run through, good for you
Brand new styles like Kung-Fu
And rip this from the front to the back
To all my peoples, where you at? I know you dig it when I kick it

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Malik B]
Wadibi-dee-doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
Skiggy-dang, skiggy-dang, you knows we gonna rock
And don't stop, just droppin off my bags, you fags
When you define, the word behind deserves you lags
We blast off like launchers, launchin' off the rockets
If you bugs, if you act like plugs, you're gettin' pulled outta sockets
The extra-curricular, particularly this
Miraculous, in lyrics they be callin' me Jesus
Please, just call me Malik, I'm not a prophet
Pass me a topic and I'll drop it
Because it gets hairier, never marry a or flurries a throne
To hell with a boy upon the microphone
Will be convenient, I'm never bein' lenient
On them folk who gonna slow-up 'cause they a dope
But a-bi-dee-doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
We makin' touchdowns 'cause we knockin' butts down, so
