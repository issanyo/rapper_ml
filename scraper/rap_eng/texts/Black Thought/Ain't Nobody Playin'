Two months prior
You said you had a dire
Emergency
It was 1:30
My face was all dirty
Trying to get some sleep
Head still whirling
Throw on my shirt and
Leave my man home
Two dots yes i'm coming
Yes my car is running
Hang up my cell phone
By the time i arrived you was deep about five
Like you had beef
And then you tried to step
And told me that i slept like you was cock deez
It was all about some nigga
You thought was jigga
Who was digging me
And i told you after that day
We ain't cool baby
So...

[Chorus]
Whatchu think this a game
Ain't no body playing
Thought i told you before
Don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice
For your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now
Really, really, really did it now
Watch out

I was kinda thrown
Head was kinda blown
But I'm not blue
Lost a couple friends once or twice before
I'm still cool
Then you tried to flex shit
Like you were the next shit
Who you trying to fool
You just another girl
From the avenue
Who graduated school
Now you wanna be down after you tried to clown me baby doll
But ain't no future in fronting and fronters
Don't hang around with me at all
And now i make my music got me some new dick and i'm doing fine
And i'm still real ghetto and i still kick your black behind

[Chorus]

Whatchu think this a game
Ain't no body playing
Thought i told you before
Don't knock-knock, knock-knock, knock-knock my door
I was trying to be nice
For your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now
Really, really, really did it now
Watch out

[Black Thought]
Yo, I'm ringing the phone
Two in the a.m. rudely awaken
Dreaming deep concentration
Hazy
She really couldn't peep what they was saying at first
All i know was jag really wasn't playing at all
She left calming to speak to the john
Got the jaguar double parked
Blinkers is on
Head pulled back
Sneakers is on
Yo i don't know what sis told her
But she bout' to get a beatin' performed
She grabbing
All up on her shirt
Tugging on her slacks
Jag tried to go in the grill
I had to hold her back
Cool her out
Told her to chill
Lower the thermostat
You a star
No need for you to stoop as low as that
Warning
Scrapping over men is best avoided
And a real lady would never confess to doing it
She said I'm gangster
Don't let the dress confuse you
The only things sweet is the music
It's really not a game

[Chorus]

Whatchu think this a game
Ain't no body playing
Thought i told you before
Don't knock on my door
I was trying to be nice
For your own advice
Ooh girl you don' did it now
Really, really, really did it now
Watch out
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
