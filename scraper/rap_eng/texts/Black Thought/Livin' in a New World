[Hook x2: John-John]
Turn up the boombox, put on your hightops
Come on outside, today's gon' be the day
We start livin in the new world

[Verse: Black Thought]
Yo, they got high-powered lenses on the cameras outside
It ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide
They hear you when you whisperin so try to keep quiet
You don't even realize that youse a twinkle in the all-seein' eye
From the time you in the bar gettin high
To havin conversations on your phone through the wire
You can't drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
Livin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe
From the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me
I couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me
Maybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically
How niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy
No benefit of doubt he had to be wrong
He from the corner where they known to get they casualty on
Another day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday
Come and lock him up Saturday morn, c'mon

[Hook x2: John-John]
Turn up the boombox, put on your hightops
Come on outside, today's gon' be the day
We start livin in the new world
