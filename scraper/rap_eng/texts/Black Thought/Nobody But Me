[Verse 1: Michael Bublé]
Baby, I get a little bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
When I'm thinkin' on you
Maybe, I might get a little reckless
But ya gotta expect that
What else can a boy do?
My mamma taught me how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care
'cause I want you, I need you all for me

[Chorus 1]
'cause I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
And I don't want anybody thinkin' just maybe
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

[Verse 2: Michael Bublé]
And I know, when you got a lovely lady
It might drive the boys crazy
When she's lookin' so fine, whooooaaahh
I know-know-know, no one would ever blame me
The only thing that could save me
Is just knowing you're mine
My papa told me, once or twice
Don't be cruel but don't be too nice
'cause I want you, I need you all for me

[Chorus 1]
'cause I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
And I don't want anybody thinkin' just maybe
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Aye, we make beautiful music together, how you make my heart sing
Grew into this I want us to never be apart thing
Work of art thing, the way you pull me like a harp string
Every moment still is worth it, that's the perfect part, see?
I like whatever you like, we had to do right
And do like, two sovereign nations and try to unite
I'm proud of you like, a treasure you're the one I'm cherishin'
Every other girl is really palin' in comparison

[Bridge]
I know, I can be a bit jealous
But how the hell can I help it?
I'm so in love with you

[Chorus 2]
I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me (hey!)
I don't want anybody lovin' my baby
Nobody (nobody), nobody (nobody), nobody but me

[Outro]
Ooh my papa told me once or twice
Don't be cruel, don't be too nice (nobody, nobody)
My baby needs no lines  from me (hey!)
Whoaaah, and I know how to share
But I'll be selfish and I don't care (nobody, nobody)
My baby don't need no one but me-eee-eeee
