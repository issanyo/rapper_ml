[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, you wasn't payin' attention
Them henchman hit the entrance
Trenchin', wasn't no means of intervention
A dollar bill will make a 110 Yen, son
How much you willin' to sacrifice to win, huh?
I personally done paid mine and then some
Climbed up an inch at a time, now, who the Zen one?
If not self, whom else could you depend on?
Friends gon' swear it's aight and probably been wrong
I've got them battlefield dents in my armor
A twitch from the drama, the trees and bad Karma
But yo, I'm a precision procedure performer
We operate every night and leave in the mornin'
To get you high as a kite is the reason you wanted
It's like, a direct flight from freezin' to burnin' hot shit
The audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix, yo

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

[Verse 2]
Yo, who got they fingers on the carousel, locked in position?
It's got to be my man, the turntable tactician
You all in a hush, silent, tryin' to listen
You wanna feel this realness that reads "spittin'"
It got ya head, splits ya eyes, can't stop twitchin'
The only thing that you can do is rock to the rhythm
Thought put it down, 'cause he's the world-renowned
See me lickin' rhymes, rappin' like I'm firin' rounds
And um, you now in tune to this infinite sound
And um, the revolution poppin' off right now
I make you raise ya fist, raise an eyebrow
Raise ya Fifth and bust it at the flag like BLAOW
You fuck-boy niggas tryin' to keep it on a hush
But Black Thought spit it cause you people want the rush
You feel? That's why the audience fiend for this fix
And Krush come with the guillotine for this mix, yo

[Various soft-spoken words from Black Thought]

[Verse 3]
Yo, I got that renaissance, turn-of-the-century choke
And I'ma do the people right if y'all just give me the vote
We finna ride, hang 'em high, Krush, give me the rope
See all the porcelain chase cats gettin' it broke
One at a time, now, let's focus on who the dime
When your blade's sharp as mine and people want you to rhyme
And want you to spill, for me, it's not nothin' for real
Me and my man runnin' Japan, yo, he tough on the wheel
He'll blow ya mind like bustin' the steel
I give the crowd somethin' to feel
This sound got the power to heal
It's like The Green Mile, now I need an hour to chill
A quarter a kill, the bird while patrollin' the field
I'm puttin' rappers out cold
I done rocked from Tokyo to the North Pole
Whenever my man program the pass code, y'all receive the fix
Aiyo Krush, come with the guillotine for this mix, yo
