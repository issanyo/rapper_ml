[Hook]
Come on, yeah
Anybody in the party that’s afraid of the dark
Shellshocked, waiting on Asia to start
Break down, break bread, let it go to your head
If you feel you’re over the ledge, then don’t be scared
It’s just a small thing baby girl, don’t be scared
Come on man, you a soldier right, don’t be scared
You’re now in it over your head, but don’t be scared
Trying to say my man gettin, when you know he ain’t dead

[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
I’m getting mine, but I’m fittin’ to get more
Smooth pimp brother, who the bitches check for
Off top everyday, I’m still spitting that dope
Hit you like weed with coke and cigarette smoke
Bring your clown ass round here
And tell your best joke
That’ll be the best way for you to get your neck broke
Bottom, top shop niggas is puffin' the best Stoges
Planet Asia from the motherfuckin’ west coast

[Verse 2 - Planet Asia]
On blast from the ‘Five-Five-Nine’, on task
I put it down, put the town on smash, who want clash?
My hustlers in the field for the cash
Ladies of leisure hopping out of cabs
Dope popping out of bags, folk dropping out of class
My shine, got the haters still talking out they ass at times
Be on the grind in the parks and in the ave for mines
At the bottom, in a bucket full of crabs
Y’all in-the-way niggas still fuckin’ up the path, for real
And got my little man’s future looking bad, it’s ill
Y’all Smack DVDs niggas ain’t real at all
‘Cause real killers keep their hammers concealed
It’s like win, lose or draw when reality spills
Battle me--chill, I’ll leave you with your cavities filled
And you can never understand how His Majesty feels
‘Cause it’s way beyond albums and deals
It’s big business, long hours, for real
Strong power from the tower of skill
Knockin’ you cowards right up out of your shells
Now follow the drill, I markets like Emoryville
Y’all Fuckin’ with ‘Asia’ -- you must be swallowing pills

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Planet Asia]
I used to be broke, but now I’m getting dough
The Asiatic poured with the fortified flow
On sight, I’m nothing polite, but y’all already know
Hit you like ‘Thirty-eights, four-fives and fo-fos’
Bring your clown ass round here
And bring your best folk
That’ll be the easiest way, to get your ass smoked
By the block, hitters from Philly to the ‘No
Black Thought, he from the motherfuckin’ East coast
Where cops don’t really go in, ain’t shootin’ no videos
My block, the main strength in the city of the ‘No
Where the killers aim clips and kick it with silly hoes
Quick to set yo' ass up for a little bit of dough
It’s the well-protected, smooth, caramel-complected
The fragrance of a pharaoh's essence, executive directed
A bold message from the Old Testament selected
Another classic out of Gold Chain Records

[Hook]

[Outro]
It ain’t nothin’ like Gold Chain Music...
It ain’t nothin’ like Gold Chain Music...
It ain’t nothin’ like Gold Chain Music...
It ain’t nothin’ like Gold Chain Music...
