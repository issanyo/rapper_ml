[Queens Bound, A Express]
This is...West 4 Street, Washington Square

Verse 1:
Yeah, niggas don't belong in my category
Leader of the Empire State, self-explanatory
Top 5, nigga...upper echelon
Heavy metal like a motherfucking decepticon
Minus the weapons charge
Niggas is slow to develop, they're prepubescent, dog
Red dot sight just to line out who I'm flexing on
Nowadays that just seems like regular protocol
Lyrical missiles to the dome that’ll dethrone the imcumbent
Guts everywhere, body dysfunction
Surgical sponges, registered nurses in abundance
Leading the new school, follow instructions
No interruptions
Don't be so quick to spit that sidewalk talk
Because perpetrators get outlined in that sidewalk chalk, nigga
Nod your head to the beat of the drum
I always speak what's on my mind, never holding my tongue
What's up?

Chorus:
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
1-2, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Main frame know they gotta be the sure shot
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Check it on, check the mm-mm mm, bust it

Verse 2:
Verbally dexterous, understand what the method is
Moving on to better things like The Exodus
You know the goal’s to reach the pinnacle of excellence
Listen up, and peep the message, kid
Niggas forever try to play me like I’m corny and shit
That’s why I’m always talking crazy like the freudian slip
That line was kinda hot, something like a jalapeño pop
Never respected keyboard thuggin through the fiber-ops
But I figure that’s what fuckboys do
That’s when I creep up from behind like I'm John Wilkes Booth
Oh yeah I’m hot now; fire starter, look I’m burning up
Oscar O’Neill on the amplifier, turn it up
Copping 40s from the corner store
I'm in the hood like piss puddles in the corridor
And furthermore...real life, no games, no gimmicks
You never heard nobody this prolific, respect the business

Chorus

[Breakdown]
Bass check 1-2
Keys check 1-2
Drums check 1-2, yeah!
Drums check 1-2, yeah!
Drums check 1-2, yeah!
Drums check 1-2, yeah!
