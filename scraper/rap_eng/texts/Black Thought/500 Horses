[Verse 1: Black Thought]
500 horses, Panamera Porsches
Sharpshooter, like I'm in the U.S. Armed Forces
I turn emcees to corpses, sons to orphans
I turn the mics on and burn rappers like crosses
I'm high-voltage, cash from undisclosed sources
Choppin' it up with other bosses on that closed door shit
It's Black Star quality, rap star salary
Do it for my city, let me know if ya'll proud of me
How I paint the picture like Diego Rivera
Easier than puttin' two pieces of Lego together
On point like an infrared laser Beretta
What I'm bringing to these rappers is a major vendetta
It's the end of your era, my dimension is terror
Family thinking they should have an intervention, you better
A lot of niggas in the game, none of them can do better
Money making trendsetters, you will never forget us

[Verse 2: Truck North]
North side terrorize the bar
From the lifestyle that most try to get involved
I represent the money making jam superstars
It's what it's like when your yacht comes with a car
Weed in the wind, livin' on the fringe
'Round here we call this some twenty-twen-twen
My chemical romance is like a coke binge
Award tour with your best broad and back again
Word, now she's the envy of all her friends
Me and my mans tag-team, whoomp there it is
It's all proper biz', what's more hot than this
Put a sucker emcee in a sarcophagus
Couple shots of the twist get a nigga bent
Grab the microphone, cold mollywhop the bitch
Black Shakespeare, the words I invent
It's like Cape Fear, whenever I'm here

[DJ Jazzy Jeff and Black Thought: Scratch Interlude]
500 [x7]
I got 5 [hunna']
Horses

[Verse 3: S.T.S.]
Couple hundred dollars for the tag on the waistline
Blowing money fast just to brag on the bass line
Deep water, Slim, you gotta swim past the safe line
Outskirt livin', house sittin' on the state line
Yeah, I talk money while I make mine, grapevine
Twist a lime spritzer, or a white wine
Night time arenas keep a schedule like [themers?]
Show up late, and then I escape with something sleazy in the beamer, tell that bitch
Roll me up, never hold me up - nigga, I be cold as fuck
Langston Hughes quotable, in photos I be Polo'd up
Logo nut, each and every city keep a local slut
Schoolly D, put down the dutch and turn my fuckin' vocals up
Shittin' us, them niggas ain't nice, nigga the jig is up
Spit amongst the best in the business, homie you kiddin' us
Make a playa handle his business, after he witness us
The first string flow, you motherfuckin', Jon Kitna us

[Verse 4: Dice Raw]
They said, "Dice, you've got 12" I said let me in
I party every night 12A.M. to 12P.M
And then I close my coffin like Dracula
My thoughts' complex like the engines on an Acura
My dick starts about as simple as a sling shot
My foot starts about as simple as high top
My nasty Gucci John, eleven-and-a-half
I kick you in your face, then put it up your ass
Then throw you in the trash, like Chinese take-out
Then hit your girl with that old 52 fake out
Then my smile looks up like the Joker's face
Nickname, Mr. make it happen, Mr. poker face
Enemy of sobriety, menace to a society
No one as fly as me, girls got their eye on me
Walkin' with the Ralph Lauren linen suit
Barely buttoned, like George Jefferson barely struttin', it ain't nothing
I'm the topic of ya'll motherfuckers discussion
And I'm the reason why ya'll niggas actin' discretion
Discretion - you niggas find me really interustin'
Busters, that's why I'm going to have to start bustin'
