[Intro: Amber Navran]
Can we just sigh? Can we let go?
Breathe in and sigh, just let it show

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Nobody know nada
We all know the fate of Assata if Cuba don’t harbor
Nobody know I’m harder on myself than lonely fathers
Watching Mrs. Parker, these days nobody know who authored
Rhymes of rappers on carpets
Nobody know who real or not
Nobody still know who shot Big and Pac, Im bothered
Prayed to our fathers for sins I committed summers
Don’t nobody know how many but we know our days are numbered
Oh my God
Nobody know the true religion
Why nobody know to show respect and mind your business
I know prison business, but nobody know how many innocent in it
Nobody know that cures cancer been made by the chemist
Nobody know the cost of a dollar worth less to em Kendrick
Nobody smart enough would ever say racism ended
I get winded by the weight of it all
‘Cus everybody talkin’ shit but don’t know nothin’ at all

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Nobody know I’m scared of personal shit
‘Cus everybody judge you, love to change the intent
Internet got no chill, nobody know how it feel to be an artist
Look, nigga this some marvelous shit
Before politics, arguing real vs radio hits
It’s all Hip Hop, you can’t divide what ain't different
Don’t like all underground music, I don’t hate all music that isnt
I was just making it clap to Wacka Flacka last Christmas, Clap!
Clap for a nigga wit her rappin’ ass
Nobody know if tomorrow promised live like its your last
Tell that crush you got you love em, they might love you back
Nobody know if we don’t speak, we don’t know the math
Google the name, if nobody know nobody can fill these shoes Im in
Watch niggas that joke around and say they just playin
Beatin me your odds look better bettin’ Lt. Dan could walk water
Barefoot, runnin’ with Forest chasing a van
If nobody know that this gon’ show you that I ain't playin, nigga

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, I thought I had the answer
But, I could not solve it (oh my God)
Even if you were to answer
I could not call it

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
If nobody, nobody matters
Why do I bother
But, I thought I had the answer
But, who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody else matter
Who knows anyway
Nobody, nobody matters
Who knows anyway

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Lost soldier wit the bars on the shoulders of my uniform
That makes ‘em ask what I do and who I do it for
Musically, I been on my Chiwetel Ejiofor
That’s 12 years a slave, but I’m on year 23 or 4
Been a lyrical grand wizard like Theodore
I'm on the same wave length the sister Rapsody is on
I love it when she get on her Bahamadia joint
If she wasn’t true she would’ve never gotten me involved
Between the world and me like Mr. Ta-Nehisi Coates
Nobody know the artist Mr. Ta-Nehisi quotes
Laughin a boars, they grasping at straws to sniff the dope
Pen been engaged for ages we should probably elope
Nobody knows how I shoot for the stars or aim at the moon
Or how I put a band-aid pon bullet wound
Or, how no matter who you are i'm just as good as you
If not better
Shit, I ain't even sure my mother knew
It hurts, yeah 2014 was the worst year
I lost the only person aware of my worst fear
That’s when I shifted up to fifth from first gear
And then I headed back to work and had church there
Oh my God
