[Verse 1: Raheem DeVaughn]
Send a message to God in Heaven
I'm thankful to be alive
Cause you sleep from 11 to 7
And work hard from 9 to 5
Cause can't nobody last forever
And everybody has to die
And everybody needs protection
I pray it don't pass me by

[Hook]
Cause everybody needs an angel
And everybody needs to smile
And everybody has an angle
And everybody wants tomorrow right now

[Verse 2]
Some say that happiness will never find you
Until you find yourself
Some say that happiness is all around you
It ain't how you measure your wealth
No, I say it's free to be yourself
We all fall short sometimes
It costs nothing
It costs nothing to help sometimes

[Hook]
Cause everybody needs an angel
And everybody needs to smile
And everybody has an angle
And everybody wants tomorrow right now

But everybody needs an angel
And everybody needs to smile
And everybody has an angle
And everybody wants tomorrow right now

And everybody wants tomorrow right now
And everybody wants tomorrow right now
Now
Now
Now
