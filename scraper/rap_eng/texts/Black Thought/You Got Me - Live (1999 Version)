(Erykah Badu):
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry you know that you got me

(Black Thought):
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before until I'm over seas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly takin' classes abroad
She's studyin film and photo, flash, focus, record
Says she's workin' on a flick and could my click do the score
She says she loved my show at Paris at Elys'e Montmartre
That I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, that shit don't matter, when I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not? You think that Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, now we're back in Philly and she up in my spot
Tellin' me the things I'm tellin' her is makin' her hot
Started buildin' with her constantly, 'round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop
And keep tellin' me'

(Erykah Badu):
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry you know that you got me

(Black Thought)
Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin' a flight
And sometimes I got to be out at the height of the night
That's when she flip and get on some

(Eve):
Another lonely night?
Seems like I'm on the side, you only lovin' your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy
Keep that shit tight
But I need some sort of love in my life
You dig me?
While politicin' with my sister from New York City
She say she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psyche
I'm playin' boo
You know its just with you I'm stayin' boo
When cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin' boo
While you're out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you're sweatin' on the stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies, they be leadin you blind

(Black Thought):
So what you sayin I can trust you?

(Eve):
Is you crazy, you my king, for real

(Both):
But sometimes relationships get ill. No doubt

(Erykah Badu):
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry you know that you got me

(Black Thought):
The snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whisperin' 'She tryin' to play you for the fool, Black'
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be
I ain't on some 'Oh I'm a celebrity'
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listenin to their squaws and listenin to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in and that's where the drama begins
She like'

(Erykah Badu):
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry you know that you got me
