[Verse 1: Black Thought]
I am a slave
Yes, I'm ony a slave
They'll place my body in an unmarked grave
In these confederate days
It's kinda hard to lift every voice singing
While worrying about how low the sweet chariots swinging
I could swing from a tree, but hey
I hope and pray that they don't kill me today
I am still just a slave

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
I am a slave in the home of the brave
A product of the triangular trade
Please pardon my ways
If I'm nervous or the slightest bit skittish
In the presence of the Portugese, Spanish, Dutch, or British
They kept me in colonial chains
Tell me how to persuade them to chill
Or to save me and still I'm a slave
I hope and pray that they don't kill me today
I am still just a slave
