[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
Merry fifth-mas ‘til you get your trees up
Black Thought spit like a firearm - lickin’ your knees up
Fifth militia crowd [?]please alight Nate Wally[?]
Worldwide - civilized when it speak ollie
Courage under fire - Thought, the wire-walkin’ SP
Smooth-talkin’ rap Attila - the hundred-spliff skilla
So travel the globe, there’s none iller
Come blows in the spine - tell her why the rhyme killer
Clone grafted on sweat that I shed - somethin’ I said
Rock a fifth insignia all up on his head
My black lung regiment can’t relate with fake shit
I’m swimmin’ with up inside the snake pit
Makeshift niggas is lost out there - the [?] turn the mics off
Y’all MCs should duck down
We comin’ with this well-wrapped sound from Philly-town
Shatter your crown - what the people want now

[Verse 2 - Ed O.G.]
Now all these chickens runnin’ round with they head cut off
And if you ever caught me sleepin’, it was after I got my nut off
You like shinin’?  It’s gettin’ shut off
We keep ones like strippers who shake they butt off
A lot of y’all can’t pay back advances
I get my grind on just like lap dances
We in the last days, the last chances
No storybook romances - me and Thought got the answers
If we wylin’ or chillin’ growin’ up in bloody streets
Or even in bleedin’ buildings - this rap thing feedin’ millions
You on a mission to shine and glisten
‘Cause money talks, and when it talks, motherfuckers listen
Now, ‘cause your ish flop
That don’t apply to me when my ish drop
I love hip-hop, and love Roxbury
Niggas be breakin’ when I rock steady
But y’all ain’t ready for Eddie - c’mon

[Verse 3 - Ed O.G.]
My team can only do the best that we can
And will never let a chicken make us less than a man
Breathe every breath that you can - I’ll be the life of the party
You’ll be the death of your man with your weapon in hand
Yo, I’m liable to let loose on my rival
On my arrival, I spit verses like the Bible
In a language that’s tribal to ensure my survival
Up in the clouds off the hydro
When I pass you, don’t get salted like a cashew
I do what I want to, and you do what you have to
Ed O.G. - and none of y’all ahead of me
On point is what you better be - dog, check the pedigree
