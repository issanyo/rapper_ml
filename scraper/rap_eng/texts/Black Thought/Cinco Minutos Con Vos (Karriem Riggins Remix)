[Hook: Marisoul]
Cinco minutos con vos

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
It's ugly, it's ugly not
Honey in the rock, money in the pot
As it begins to simmer down, thickening the plot
It's hard to say if anyone was listening or not
Look at you and me and the devil, three's company
I'ma be below sea level, please come for me
Loving you is where it's at, look what you've done for me
If I told you 'you feel high,' then you'd jump for me right?
You catch more flies with sugar than you do with shit
A wise woman told me while clutching her crucifix
I don't really have an excuse for this elusiveness
I stole a moment of truth, mutual exclusiveness
Like water and grease, warfare and peace
To crave sweet revenge and find sweet release
In the thrill of a victory, agony of defeat
The man I was meant to be is passing me in the street
The dark horse marched forth going further off course
Nevermind, I lost mine when you lost yours
One life, one death, which will cost more?
Crawling on the parquet floor doing parkour
To be alarmed by the sounds of the foghorn
What I need is closure I'm getting my epilogue on
You're Mississippi God-damned but I'm dog-goned
You never miss a good thing until it's long gone

[Refrain I: Black Thought]
Brandishing the heater, suddenly I had this
Urge to reemerge just to brush away the ashes
Passive aggression, aggressively passive
Loading my weapon while I'm checking for your address
Crucible, crazy what the temperature can do to you
5 minutes left until the last dance, beautiful

[Hook]

[Hook: Elvis Costello]
I stood at the curb, trying not to disturb
The dark carnival crew
And a glittering voice far off there said
'rejoice as the casualties are but few'
Going to tell you now, before I forget myself
I could let you loose, but the key won't undo the lock
And the face of the clock seemed to merrily mock
These five minutes with you

[Verse II: Black Thought]
And when the clock strikes time comes to life
Slightest oversight cuts like a knife
Against my better judgement I had sacrificed
Very last chance encounter with my future wife
Searching for the love of christ, purchasing the merchandise
Lurching through the curtains trying to hide what I was hurting like
Pretty certain that some person gotta die tonight
And there's no hiding the truth in the guiding light
No confidential info, me llamo ensiamento
Who you call the angel of death is like my only kinfolk
My heavy bleeding heart is adding injury to insult
And I would gladly kill for just a five minute intro
Oh the felonious conduct of his holiness
Courting lil homie is less than ceremonious
Orchids, begonias, eyes like Appolonia's
Looking like she'd just seen a ghost like pretty Tony is
Miserable, invisible bully like the gooch
Better be continually and fully sniper proof
A hunter with a gun in his hoodie likes to shoot
For a moment I just sat by the door
Like the spook watching time tick
Counting down like a convict
Wishing that my trigger finger was non-responsive
Or that the overcoat that I donned was non-stick
Or that my mental wasn't this far beyond sick

[Refrain II: Black Thought]
Brandishing the heater, suddenly I had this
Fever was it me or either some sort of madness
Napoleon complex, his royal badness
Loading my weapon while I'm checking for your address
Stupido, half-man half-marsupial
Blood splattered cashmere afghan, beautiful

[Outro: Elvis Costello]
Five minutes with you
