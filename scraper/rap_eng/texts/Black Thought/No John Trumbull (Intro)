The Hamilton Mixtape

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
You ever seen a painting by John Trumbull?
Founding fathers in a line, looking all humble
Patiently waiting to sign a declaration and start a nation
No sign of disagreement, not one grumble
The reality is messier and richer, kids
The reality is not a pretty picture, kids
Every cabinet meeting is like a full on rumble
What you're about to witness is no John Trumbull
