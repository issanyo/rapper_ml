[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Five thousand dollar coat shit
If you working hard for that dollar, holla "dope shit"
Or holla marijuana, heroin, and coke shit
For people that hustle did a snort and then smoke it
I came from a culprit to the pulpit
This cold shit is vintage and high voltage
I try to focus, how should I approach this?
I've decided I let 'em learn through osmosis
Double the doses, 63rd and [?]
You can form my swarm, like a hoard of locusts
I move certain drugs, opium and Persian rugs
I really only communicate with certain thugs
Such a wide variety of anxiety
Real muslims telling me 'Riq, that ain't piety
I'm still struggling to achieve sobriety
Before I wash my hands of things entirely

[Hook: STS]
I got them haters looking bad
I ain't do shit but pop my tag
I got them haters looking mad
And I know why, it's because I'm in my bad
Okay I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm swagged out, let's brag about this logo pull yo tag out
I'm a rockstar, like Smashmouth,  real niggas [?]

[Verse 2: STS]
Well hello motherfuckers, I told you you can't duck us
God damn I hate you niggas, all you niggas Uncle Ruckus
And yeah, this my introduction, hey schooly roll me something
Hell, I'm just gonna get high as fuck, cause they can't tell me nothing
[?] and I'm lost in, green thumb like Boston
Celtics like Rondo, my weed man'll come pronto
I kick shit, Tai Kwondo, told a bitch to call me Jondo
When I smash she ask if we'll meet again, I said honestly, I don't know
Ire' whiskey in my flask, Ralph and Ricky on my ass
I'm stuntin' on, you better pay attention, matter fact you can put it on my tab
[?] smoke like niggas but I eat like [?]
Told my niggas to play your role never know one day might win the Oscar
I'm all [?] I'm so gone, [?] I'm so thrown
Wonder what ain't no clone, be the kings of kings ain't no throne
We prolong this long enough, jam boy we strong enough
[?] napkin, go captain, [?] roll up

[Hook x2]
