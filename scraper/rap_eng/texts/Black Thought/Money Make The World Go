[Hook: x2]
Money make the world go
Money make the world go
Money money money money
Money make the world go
Round round round round
Round round round round

[Verse 1 - Dice Raw]
I go out in a blaze or, go out on the stage cause
Life is but a dream or, maybe it's a joke
God played on us poor folk, growing up in smoke
It's rough waters up ahead, so keep your head afloat
Keep an eye on the white house, one on the Pope
Cause sleeping ain't a luxury that niggas can afford
Man, who knows what the world of politics has in store for us
Blacks banned in rap, or new improved crack
Devil in the bottle so I hit the gas full throttle
Turned it up full blast, cruising through the streets
I know north-side, south-side yeah my block
Without MTV jams, why nigga why not?
Kids I went to school with are in jail, or with Jesus
Man, the other half sitting at home watching Regis
Trying to get enough money for another pack of cigarettes
On house arrest, yeah I know you dealing with the stress cause

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2 - Black Thought]
I'm from the bottom of the barrel where them roaches and the crabs at
Ain't no taxi cabs at, dead beat dads at
Kidnappin's and stabs at, bad blood and bad rap
Life is like a tragic comedy without the laugh track
Got to get some assets, money on the fast track
Aflac, or NASDAQ, a matress where the stash at
Models, doctors, lawyers, even actresses you have that
You can walk up right into their practices and smash that
Checks you can cash that, top you can pass that
Car that you desire, you can cop, but don't crash that
Rock truck chains like it's an '85 flash back
Currency to courtesy, it'd be a [minor asscap?]
Two fifteen, do get cream, legal tender do get clean
Promise I'mma do big things, for my daughter sweet sixteen
Pray the father keep this team, safe, and let me get this green
Spit this flame, rip this lane, Jam Boys hear to sing again..

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 3 - Truck North]
Coast to coast this how I go, a beach boy in Kokomo
Know I scheme to kill your queen, you might've seen me once before
Money Making Jam family all in this 'bout the dough
Creepin' with your bottom hopin' you ever see the pro
Have you on the ledge, leapin' off screamin' "Geronimo"
Fist full of dollas like I'm out of here in twenty-fo'
Powers in, my powers is wearin' off I need a little mo'
Time, cause it's critical when money gettin' minimal
Make you wanna run up in a bank with a weapon to
Clean out the vault like a strong arm professional
Tell a nigga buckle up I'm finna break a neck or two
If it's bout the currency I swear the foul is technical
Swear to bob 'em hater proof, homie who the hell is you
We tell you what you can and cannot do like it's congretional
Chins, we done checked a few, fortunes we done spend 'em too
Yeah I know it's pitiful, pitfalls are plentyful
