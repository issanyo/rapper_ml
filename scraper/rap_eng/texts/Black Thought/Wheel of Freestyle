[Verse 1: Common]
Common sense right now I'm like the sinner
Mix me up, y'all you can put me in the blender
Understanding style this is the style I make
Put me in the blender and I end up like a shake
A protein one yo, yo I get it done
Questlove on the drums
Yo, yo I gotta run with a different type of style, yo a different type of flow
I'm from Chicago, yo I got the snowplow
Snowplow and you know that's not soul glo
Common sense sometimes I go solo
It's like this common sense I'm comin' down
This is what I do, yo I hold down the fort yo
This is what I'm comin' to yo, it's just me and you
Shout out to my man named Keanu
And we come through yo, y'all know I fix
Y'all know Keanu for what the matrix

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yeah, let me put this brick to mortar
Three words in that particular order
Ain't no two cents I'ma give you a quarter
Com had to take from the butcher's daughter
Had a bottle of water, I drank it
I'm ice cold with it, get me a blanket
Now I'm saying hold up, I'm on the thanks tip
Writing thank you notes just like James and Frank did
Hold up, yo, bring the style back
Just like you got hijacked
On cloud nine with it, girls reachin' they climax
I'm larger than life, I'm like the imax
The baddest rapper she's heard of
Matter fact I take it three further
Cheeseburger, cheeseburger, cheeseburger

[Verse 3: Common]
Common sense yo I'm with the roots crew
Hip-hop, hip-hopping like a kangaroo
What can I do yo, I can't hold back
Call me kangaroo jack or kangaroo black
Black thought yo, we all sorta driving
Understand Com Sense I'm always soul surviving
Coming clean I don't even need the green
I'm in the green you see me in the limousine
And we be on the team
Yo, I got this sheen like my man Questlove with the afro
Sometimes I battle sometimes I straddle formality
Common Sense I'm the realest in virtual reality
Comin' real with this type of style  from the Stoney Isle
Only child, yo I'm with Jimmy Fal'
Holdin' down the fort
Yo it's like a sport
I'm down with The Roots crew and Black Thought
