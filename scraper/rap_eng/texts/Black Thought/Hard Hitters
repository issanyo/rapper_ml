[Hook]
Stories 'bout the angels of brotherly love
This is for the sisters and brothers we love "Come on"
We care enough to give it uncut, straight up
With no chaser cause time don't wait up
Thats why we're sending cats back to the lab "Worldwide"
The microphone's up for grabs
Thats why we're sending cats back to the lab "Evidence"
The microphone's up for grabs

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Yo
Hunters and gatherers, Nomads in Attica
Radical Terrorists and those who tally up the data
What matters most is they can boast
But scatter when toast is close
Burners pressed to your throat you ghost
Of course
You could chose to go against the force
I'll fire straight ahead
There'll be no mission abort
We can take it to the streets or take it to court
Supreme shit get hit over your fort, open the door
We've opened up for different artists on tour
Sixty percent love, Forty percent war
Let's settle the score
Most things are rot at the core
Not what they seem
Watch the two worlds you're stuck in between
Or pay the penalty
Zero strikes, Zero Felonies
Lay low hakido master
Redirecting energy
I use words similar but none sound fresher than
"Three of us who rap together"

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
Aiiyo you could probably find Rakaa at De Rokerij
Puffin' AK, sippin cafe au lait
In Amsterdam chillin in the cafe all day
Bang my shit between classes in your school hallways
You're fuckin' with expansion all-access
Hard journeys make you treat your mic like a cactus
Rap iconoclast that loves to sound flash
And sticky green grass with orange and brown hash
Take your tape up and take this on
I heard anything that does not kill will make strong
And I build one of the sickest holding this still
You need a dose of eccinacea with a little golden seal
If you boots turn up my two boots
Babu slice and dice your crew and produce hits
Misunderstandings go back to the blues but ah-
There ain't nothing like hip hop music

The microphone's up for grabs

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Live everyday like its your last
Cause one day ??you'd fight??, my nigga
Fuck around son it might be tonight cause figure
The likeliness of you surviving this brawl is slim
It's like scuba diving with no oxygen
Monster when I situate my slang
Leave a nigga almost brainless once and bang
Had a crowd screamin bout how they don't want your thang
Keep it the sharpest one in the game its no secret
My style is certified , Philly-Animal rough
Runnin' things, pull more strings than gamble and huff
Cannibal hustlers taught me how to handle myself
Hit man for hire pull a hot pick from shelf and spark
The pioneer to represent illadelph is Thought
I got these weak niggas pullin theyselves apart
Y'all know the tone the one that hold the throne
That radiate your dome like a motorola phone nigga*echoes*

Dilated*echoes*

"From the angels of cali to illadelph crack build"
"Hard Hitters"
