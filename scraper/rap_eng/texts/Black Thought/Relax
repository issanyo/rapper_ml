[Hook x2]
Sit back, y'all and just relax, y'all
Sit back, y'all and just relax, y'all
Sit back, y'all and just relax, y'all
Sit back, y'all and just relax

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Ooooh child, your nose just got blows down the rows
And soul plants with baggy pants, growin' Afros to catch
Saxophone like scats and tones to relax
Stacks of poems slip, drip from ya dome
Ya slide on ya ride from the Shack to the cardiac
Chords of jazz and sho 'nuff, the sound's bad
So, slap five, Mr. Nappy Cat got the groove to move ya back
Herb like verb, the sack's fuller
I trickles on the nickel and dime vibe beyond sidewalk
And sound stage around, I put ya down with the sugar
It's sweet, so lick ya lips as ya taste ???
They got the hip, cats trippin'
Daddy-O, when I was lad, I ??? at you
Excuse me as I catch the boogie like the flu
God bless Jamaaladeen and the rest playin' the axes
Just the fatness, dig? Now, sit back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Strings and things that we brings is the swings and wings
To get you flyer, higher than those Kaya L's
The izm, ??? baptism, just sit back, listen, check it
You're coolin' with the cat that got the method
Or should I say the man with the plan that can
Rock 'em all, 'nuff respect to Jamar, that's my man
Lord, I had a rough day, so crank that beat up to the max
Then I can relax and kick my feet up
Maybe it's cold, baby, if so, I'll turn the heat up
And listen to this and pull the blanket and the sheet up
We're ridin' over grooves on the abstract train
And glidin' over measures, givin' pleasure to the brain
Drops of jazz fallin' from the sky like the rain
Slow and then it's flowin' and it's goin' down a drain
Perhaps, I catch ya taste for bass and perfect
You plays the sax while invitin' you all to sit back

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Ooooh child, your nose just got blows down the rows
And soul plants with baggy pants, growin' Afros to catch
Saxophone like scats and tones to relax
Stacks of poems slip, drip from ya dome
Ya slide on ya ride from the Shack to the cardiac
Chords of jazz and sho 'nuff, the sound's bad
So, slap five, Mr. Nappy Cat got the groove to move ya back
Herb like verb, the sack's fuller
I trickles on the nickel and dime vibe beyond sidewalk
And sound stage around, I put ya down with the sugar
It's sweet, so lick ya lips as ya taste ???
They got the hip, cats trippin'
Daddy-O, when I was lad, I ??? at you
Excuse me as I catch the boogie like the flu
God bless Jamaaladeen and the rest playin' the axes
That's the fatness, dig? Now, sit back
