[Hook: Maimouna Youssef]
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

[Verse 1]
Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?
Something don't feel right out here

[Hook: Maimouna Youssef]
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

[Verse 2]
Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman
And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing
My main adversary any silly concoction
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook: Maimouna Youssef]
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

[Verse 3]
Yo, children working, weapon producing
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all got to make that living
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free
If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me

[Hook: Maimouna Youssef]
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same
