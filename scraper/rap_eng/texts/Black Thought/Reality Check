Yo
I'm having trouble at the crib
I'm goin at it with my baby mother where I live
While the soilders bleed
The economy recede
And all she want to watch is reality TV
Went from a Surreal Life to Strange Love
Some behaviour I couldn't figure the flavor
Drive by the Charm School
Where she Fell in Love with New York
And love Money, that's what I'm not made of
I bought a membership to the Celebrity Fit Club
To see if I could stand a Real Chance with this love
It don't make sense
The way she tried to turn a G to a Gent
But need Tough Love, don't get it mixed up
I was one of those WildBoyz
Shooting for Seizmore
She was alittle live jawn, watching The Osbournes
The Best Week Ever
Had her Going for Broke like Eddie Griffin
Or Danny Bonaduce
But no she never listen
When I drop a Super Sweet 16
Daydreaming of becoming Miss Rap Supreme
Or maybe Making the Band will bring your gunz out
Sing your lungs out
Move out like Daddy's Girls out of Runs House
But that's Against All Odds
Pick apart and might come and try to Flip Your Ride
Real as Real Houswifes of Atlanta
Yeah it's real outside
Ending like an episode of College Hill outside
Whether it be for the love of the PayDay
Or for the love of trying to have a baby for Ray J
The most modest model on Project Runway
She want to be Kimora living life in the Fab Lane
And change her last name
And since Gotti's Way was passe
She watch Salt & Pepper and Celeb Rehab Day
That's all she talk about at the cafe
I swear to God it drove me to drink about half a carafe'
My head still spinning
I'm so through with women
Who watch reruns of the Real World with dinner
And Kim Kardashian moms and Bruce Jenner
And Three 6 Mafia show and Jerry Springer
Scott Baio 46 and knocked up
I'd rather see the First 48 or Locked Up
Instead it's just a Nanny 911
I'm Trading Spouses
Extreme Makover, she rearranged the couches
Now, she keep changing outfits
I'm about to have to get at Dr. Phil to do something about this
The house not fresh
She not Top Chef
I tell her Viva la Bam, she tell me not yet
Watching Cribs
Looking at shit she never gonna get
Americas Best Dance Crew, she trying to do the steps
About to do her like Beyonce and tell her to the left
Truth be told, she bout to television me to death!
Yo!
