[Part 1: Mike Shinoda "Get Me Gone"]
Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping
"Just play the keys"
That my band had a singer
They didn't need me
But my band had my back
So we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humour faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true
Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do
So we had to disprove it
We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule
I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something fucking absurd
Oh, did I lose you at "infer"?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?
People used to "infer" that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what
Which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me
Bitch

[Interlude: Eminem & Brenda "Prank Call"]
I knew it, I fucking knew it
Yo, what the fuck, what the fuck?
Who are you talking to?
I'll come down and fucking pop you I swear to god
Really, really?
I'll fucking kill you
I'll kill your ass you motherfucking
Yo, you know who the fuck I am bitch
This is Slim motherfucking Shady

[Part 2: Eminem "Fight Music"]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda "Until It Breaks"]
(I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup?
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the lineup, lineup?)

[Hook: Eminem "Drama Setter"]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Part 3: Freddie Gibbs "Scarface"]
Chiefing on that, think I hear my heart beat
Smoking, got me rolling stogies on a dark street
Let's jack this nigga cause he got some shit we can't afford
Another day in Gary, 'nother couple niggas in the morgue
He got the beating, his weed crumbs on plush seats
Niggas wanna hate, they get yellow tape'd and white sheets
And he steady talking, my chopper, he gonna let it rip
All the bullets that got my name on 'em still in the clip
Life's a bitch, I was a virgin, hope she let me fuck
Pray I miss before a nigga bust his last nut
Homie '84 got the same rims that mine had
Freddie jumped up in it like freshman year with the dime bags
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pulling stick ups to the nigga from a no-name
Diamond bezel, went from pebbles to a whole thing
Now them punk detectives in my section know my whole name
Gibbs, nigga

[Hook: Eminem "Drama Setter"]
I'm a drama setter
Grippin' my Berretta, sippin' Amaretto
Man, you crazy if you think I'ma let up
I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter

[Part 4: Black Thought]
Well I'm a downtown shooter who that?
The crown ruler is back
He kind of grew into the shape of a mack
Look how I do it, yo I'm taking you back
This how you rise down to the foundation
How sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just making it hap'
To all the frauds stop faking, relax
And to the broads if you caking
Then clap then shake it without breaking your back
I know the world been waiting for that
You been aching for that cause
What they playing on the station is whack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad, so fresh
You know it's Black Thought
And your boy the bro ?uest, but
Where my grimy figures at?
Look lively addressing the captain
Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh, answer me
"What kind of question is that?"
I'll show you where my rare essence is at, the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessing to rap
And you can check my stats 'cuz worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero? Oh, yes
If you asking anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque
My squad, so fresh
You know its Black Thought
And your boy the bro ?uest, but

[Hook: Eminem "Drama Setter"]

Just don't get in the way of my cheddar
Man, ‘cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go lookin' for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With your momma crying
‘Cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin' up
‘Cause I'm a drama setter
