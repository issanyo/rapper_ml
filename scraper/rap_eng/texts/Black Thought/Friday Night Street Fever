[Hook/Intro: Black Thought]
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Cheeba, cheeba this is Friday night street fever
The heat seeker, keep it cuttin' like a meat cleaver
The grim reaper, I ain't eatin' ya'll ain't eatin' neither
The team leader, dream weaver, keep a mean diva
Makavellian, illegal alien rhyme on [nellian?]
Half ya'll cats are full of helium
Fuckin' with piranhas up inside of the aquarium
Breakin' sound barriers, cats is hail-maryin'
I am the apostle, I try to keep it gospel
It's on, knowing that aroma hit me in the nostril
I start spittin' shit white boys say they can mosh to
The hostile, natives here to motherfucking rock you
And pop this and that a ways, poison his gamma rays
Money making jam, split your brain to the mayonnaise
Then we at the VMA's playing it low-key
If I'm the best, then toast me and give me my trophy
You know the sick flows is what I kick mostly
You going to have to bring an army, you cannot just toast me
Your main lady tell me I'm in love like Joasky[?]
Take a shovel, look above, and filleted like poultry

[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Secrets of a true magician, it's Jam Boy Magic
Pop up at your crib then slap you with the ratchet
You got it backwards, put your brain inside a basket
Blow a gasket, get your ass whipped wrapped in plastic
Throw them in the placid, I spit acid
And ecstasy, plus I got the recipe
Only niggas fucking with me standing right next to me
A million dead rappers and they at the bottom of the sea
And that's a good start, please don't let me start
Come up like tree bark, don't let me talk
Cause I'm gon' talk shit, then I'm going to back it up
These niggas is trash, somebody better slap them up
Step into my cypher, it's filled with lifers
It's filled with snipers, it's similar to Rikers
With eyes like tigers, and arms like spiders
With hearts like fires, and smiles like liars
With grip like pliers, and mouth like Pryors
It's raps new messiahs, man throw them in the frier

[Verse 3: Truck North]
These niggas get gassed like a Citgo
And what it's hittin' for
The Jam Boys get money like a Paltrow
And get bids from the in to the outro
Thinking they can fuck with the squad, they out they mind yo
Strapped to the teeth, guns nigga yo Joe G.I
Fresh when they see I
Time goes on, no rest for the weary
So if you peep the boy, peep the bad bitches with me
I think they got a problem Houston, call Whitney
It seems that I'm outer space and no jitney can get me
They like North cause he so sure like Atlantic City
In school I was the Dean no Martin, no Remey
I simply, cause a total shock to your culture
Hop in my car, drive to the Mars like Volta
Wait for you to fall, hit your carcass like a vulture
Niggas is endangered species, I'm a poacher
Askin' where the tusk at, nigga it's a must that
Jam Boys get paid, or else you get a gut-check
And got all the sucka niggas like what's next
Public enemy times three, the main suspects

[Verse 4: Peedi Crakk]
As I remain this, lyrical genius
You can't see me, but I can see the Venus
I can see your future, for you nothing changes
For me it's kind of strange, cause all I see is Beamers
Benzes, rangers and cause I arrange bangers
Why you writing raps, man you should be a singer
You should be a dancer like a ballerina
Get this boy a tutu, what we going to name her
We'll just call her Tutu, me and [Joey zutsu?]
We on some old school Philly shit, you ain't used to
Lookin' for a new boo, somethin' like a New New
I just want to train her, put her on the choo-choo
All you little rappers know Peedi go the meanest
And if I wasn't famous, you'd still be on the penis
Don't mean to be an anus, why you being brainless
I should be ashamed, don't know why I entertain this
