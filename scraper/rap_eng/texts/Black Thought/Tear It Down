[Hook: Money Making Jam Boys]
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Down

[Verse 1: STS]
Handle my handles, what I don't handle, I dismantle
My fitted is Mickey Mantle, my pendleton heavy flannel
What's crackin' like roman candles, no backing like open sandals
Flip like remotes when I channel, host and preside on the panel
This ain't the wisest of gambles, my dogs will body your mammals
Take pride in making examples, this is an excellent sample
My bad, Khari production, rich as Ferrari production
Kid with the art of destruction, my flow retarded or somethin'
You're not a part of discussion, soft as the heart of a muffin
This shit is hitting my nigga hard, it could cause a concussion
Harvest the stuff that I'm puffin', up in the cut that you cuffin'
Fucking the slut that you struttin'
Basically up to nothing

[Hook: Jam Boys]
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round

[Verse 2: Truck North]
Start to the ending, beginning of your finish
Jam Boys win and take over that's the premise
Give a big hate to society's menace
Mayor McCheese, about to make your girl Grimace
Bear witness to a scare tactician
A nightmare master, in your dreams I get you
The tombstone pisser, for a last laugh with you
When I'm on the scene niggas freeze like a picture
Please no flash photos, it's murder on the low though
Mister Big "Live and Let Die" Yaphet Kotto
Over niggas heads like my planes on auto
Pilot, so I fly in a flock on solo
Try it if you need to, but talk to your people
Leave a hero dead no chance for a sequel
And wild like Mr. Hyde is my alter-ego
Jam Boys lethal, there are none equal

[Hook: Jam Boys]
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round

[Verse 3: Dice Raw]
Jam Boy, the greatest rapper never
Understand boy, I don't think you could ever
Bring this man down, my reign will last for never
Which means I pull quiet, watching the fools riot
Niggas don't think of fucking with me, not alone try it
I'm sitting on the throne, all alone in silence
No time to weigh it up, so I just eyed it
I ain't a pimp either nigga, I just talk fly
Them niggas fighting over shit I just walk by
Toss them a crumb, set them up to be the fall guy
The big next vex snacking on them small fries
Fake hustlers singing songs of all lies
Why make records, man? I've got something you should try
It's called suicide, who let these fools inside?
The alphabet is my tool I just utilize
The English language my bitch I just brutalize

[Hook: Jam Boys]
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
These rappers come a dime a dozen, I'm one in a million
Picture a villain on the run with a gun in your building
In search of the city of God, I'mma kill a Brazilian
Nobody make it out alive but the women and children
It's your last hurrah
The reaper with the street sweeper was passing by
So you ask to die
So it's emotion ain't no way you can stop the surgery
Feel them fiber-optics when that pen drop, ya' heard me
Passed treacherous, the last excellent
Ceremonial master, causing the mass exodus
Specialize and maximize in my effectiveness
Never peace, when you a beast like Dr. Jekyll is
Diamonds on my necklace, shottas I'm connected with
Probably trying to find you, now continue popping reckless
You ain't got to love this, but respect for this is definite
Riq Gees for President
The next testament

[Hook: Jam Boys]
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round
Tear it up, tear it down
Break it up, break it down
Smoke it up, drink it down
Bring us another round
