[Intro]
Black Rock

[Verse 1: Dice Raw]
Yo, what's for breakfast?
Same as yesterday
Oh, that's right, cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
Then what's for dinner? Nothing, nigga
But last night I had dreams of a porterhouse
For real, for real, I feel like cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that, growing up, yo, here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like cops but what the fuck do I know?

[Hook: Dice Raw]
At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Guess you pay the price when you never do right
One thing I know, all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl
(Yeah, yeah!)

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas, onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them, ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
Out of bandwidth, animal anguish
So love no bitch, die rich is the language
Guilty as sin, depending on a reed shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here looking for its end

[Hook: Dice Raw]
At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Guess you pay the price when you never do right
One thing I know, all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl
(Yeah, yeah!)
