[Hook: Mercedez Martinez]
I hear somebody screaming
Again bracing for the fall
Close my eyes but I never wonder
I have seen it all

[Verse 1]
They don't remember
Was it coming? Was it going?
Running from the sun
Listen through the morning

[Bridge]
I'm coming
Take my chance my footsteps in the road
No one sees and no one knows
I'm coming [x3]

[Interlude: Instrumental]
