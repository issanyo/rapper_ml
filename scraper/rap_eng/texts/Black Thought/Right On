Hit it!

[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people counting on me kind of like a digit
It's a cold world, I'm not fronting like it isn't
It's no time for coming up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'mma raise the bar though like Brigitte
See there a star go, don't blink, you might miss it
It's precious cargo you got to be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types, be more specific
Shit, I'm Black Thought what could be more prolific
For this love I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond a gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hit list that's about business
Yo can a brother get a witness? Dig it
Right on

[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on

[Verse 2: Sugar Tongue Slim]
Ok I'm above and beyond hot, my measurement in watts
Time rate of flow and energy ain't never going to stop
Pressure's on I won't pop, microphone I won't drop
Gemstones niggas cop ain't shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion of the hop, the new star of the hip
I shine a light for the future so my present's a gift
It's evident I'm heaven sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverence for what I represent should show my benevolence
This is Philly, I'm repping for the art of the city
Came from southwest Atlanta, gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry, cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shooting up the club like they party with Diddy
You get the diggy? I flip my incandescents to flourescents
And in essence I can burn 1000 joules of energy per second
I put them on to lessons while I'm smoking on the blessing
The switch hitter like Pete Rose, right up the session
Right on

[Hook: Joanna Newsom]
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the Book of Right On is right on
It was right on
