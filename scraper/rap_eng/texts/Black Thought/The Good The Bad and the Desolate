Shanky Don Intro:
Now this one is dedicated to the good the bad and the desolated. And The
Roots crew you know them lyrically orientated program you lose in life
Instantly ? we're like acid we burn you. Watch a rude bwoy now

Black Thought:
Yo you should see some of these cats that vocalize
They get props from they local guys and try to raise
Speaching through the mic like "Yo I apologize"
They blind and wasn't as wise and fail to realize the com-
Plectual sexual side of the rhyme
When I make love to the mic the crowd respond
Your promoter love the vocal over dub when I control the club
So throw your hands up in the air show your love
We waste not the bangingest beats but make use
The Roots get you open like parachutes
Yo who in the house only deal with hip hop that's authentic?
Back to renovate your state of mind for a minute
It's I, Bad Lieutenant represent Phi-la
Delphia empire fifth dynasty
Your third eye couldn't wait for you to relate to what I activate
While the fake spectate
I'm less than impress-ed for beyond stressin'
And battle as a reveloutionary adolescent
But now in the present with fake masters of ceremonies yo that's phoney
You'll get capped with colonial force that of a cannon
Examinin the compact disc to start rammin'
To put the diagram in effect and get fly
On immature MC's who try
Wake 'em up outta they High School High

Shakny Don:
Yo bumbading bumdadabedang
The Roots crew boy we mash things again
Bumbading ripapadededang The Roots crew bwoy we runnin' back again
Bumbading dumdadadedang The Roots boy dem run the island
Bumbading ripadededang look ? I mash up the scene

Malik B (M-illa-tant):
I blast off the roof to prove she lay in there blazed
Enslaved by the soundwaves as the skills amaze
Insight skin type analytic cause I live it
My cerebral pivot over your style like "give it"
The lyricism I'm contemplatinng your neighborhood or legion
Brutalize your section stalk your whole region
When you blink it's hell then you drink Zinfandel
You wonder what's goin' inside of my thinkin' cells
We bomb like militias I'm trying to stack riches
Look first comes the money the power then the (?)
They all will bring you down but I Milliant the sound
With a bargaid of pirate raps that's running through your town
Surrounded by a wise dome my ledge knows horizons
I keep at a distance confused and feel cyclones
You know I'm trying to make it because I probably take it
Hustlin' stickin' pickin' it or scrape it
Tracks appeal that's why I'm trying to mack a mil
I stay sedated worth a Zantac that's a pill
It gets hectic that's why niggas try to exit
Stress relates to those who walk around protected

Shanky Don:
Yo bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man dem mash up the scene
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man is running back again
Bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man them come back again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run the islang

Dice Raw:
Naw nigga what's up then? Thanks for the man outroduction
Go ask your girl inside my world is the duction
No frontin' finger on the button of destruction
Play nice like entice and keep your styles on the hush and
Step inside the illafifth dungeon
Where it smells of pungent
The underwater the brotherly lovin'
Where crabs get knocked out respect from
Brought back to the lab were the scientist will dissect 'em
The old heads sniffin' start bitchin' when we testin'
Interupting my class when my class is in session
Was when I manifestin' or come to teach a lesson
What's inside of my dome I'll have all you clones guessin'
Lets begin as the color gets tossed in with the pen
It feels good that's when you know it's a sin
Everytime I rhyme I might get charged for murder
Slicing your back with rap turn a brain into burger
Lyrically I shot with radioactive waves
Like Kolby and Cosmic Kev on fridays
Your styles older than Yoda we on the top of ?
Claim to gettin' over but you ain't makin' quota

Shanky Don:
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they mash up the lane
Bumbading bumdadadedang this a poor rap boy you might not see again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run things again
Bumbading bumdadadedang Rufugee Camp step on thee scene
Bumdading bumdadadedang
