[Hook]
It's the Concerto of The Desperado
R-double-O-T-S, check the flow
If you know like I know, then you know the motto
That's all the fraud/fake shit gots to go

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Yo, in the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without Delilah, my soliloquy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The Halflife of Illadel' LP, no filler, proceed
Hitherin' is my death, I will blow your tower to smithe-
-reens, the fiends catch another rhyme river
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox hip-hop minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah, my thought's swifter
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So, check for the Fifth Militia
A poet's under pressure, stressin' that you get the picture (Click!)
Even if it mean you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya crew because you're amateur
Styles gunnin' down your sound man and manager, what!?
This how we do it in the year of '96
With this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin' MC's down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The implorer, the universe explorer
Treat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin' these niggas open like the box of Pandora
With styles that's Newer than the World Order
Approximately 3/4 of y'all are water, I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it, I'm the Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestri-an
I crush a mount-ain into grains of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The Desperado that refuse to follow
The Fifth aficionado, break you up into parts like vibrato
I'm deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back-and-forth
The same old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist that leave you lost like a tourist
Inside the chorus, niggas is bringin' nothin' for us
As we're breakin' 'em down to fraction, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, Respond/React once more

[Hook x2]
