[Chorus: Audio Sample]
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
We are the masters of our fate!
As long as we have faith
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
The time has come, I just begun, this is designer rum
My wallet got flowers on it, killer cowards from milan
The stolen land where gold chains control a man
300 holdin hands, stolen grams
I play the fan, and wave and leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him?
Spittin out phlegm, no, just grave him
I remember days I used to work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buyin whippids, laughing at jokes and try to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, can’t tell me nothing
Whatever this thing of ours is empowered by my niggas who pumping
24 hours of sling motion, wave brush
Ya'll knew my hair was the ocean
Running through the building just nego-tion
Some of the creeps knew me very well
Knew he would sell, knew he was potent

[Chorus: Audio Sample]
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Ok, bridges I burned some, lessons I learned some
Money I spend some, lent some, earned some
My eyes tell a tale of the hell I returned from
Spark up a L for the homies I haven't heard from
Burn when the urge come
I’m living lurge(large)
Never chilling on the curb, just a villian on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as official as the third one
Second one, first one
Worse come, the worst run
When I was pushed out of the womb the earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they could try me, Who the first up?
I don’t guarantee no survivers, nigga surfs up
Yeah, soul on ice, courage and sacrifice, hold on tight
And save your laughter for the afterlife
These chumps thinkin they good, ain't even half as nice
Your fate will be a one-way ticket to paradise

[Chorus: Audio Sample]
Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
In the words of the [?]
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings
His heart is fixed, rafting in the Lord
