Verse 1 [Black Thought]
I said:
I've been off the chain since I lost my brain
This franchise player has never lost a game
They say loss of sanity is the cost of fame
In that all-terrain Rover that cost some change
I'm Philly-bound on the turnpike crossing lanes
I'm all over like a shooter with awful aim
Pull up and crush it 'til they usher me off the stage
From the boss brigade, and we toss grenades
So gimme dap like the group home of Sharon Jones
Jam boy militia in it for life, Aaron Jones
I'm on top of the world, but I ain't there alone
Cuz wifey with me with them bugs bunny carrots on
I'm in a Herringbone suit, I'm so baritone
I am never satisfied welcome to the terror dome
Of the greatest man alive, basically a miracle
Body slam the beat like I'm the killer Chris Jericho
Switch up that scenario if yall don't really hear me though
Excellent imperial, I do 'em something terrible
Shit that make your lady think of doing something [?]
When you slick as this it make the women wanna stare at you
Hard, they ask "who are you" I say "I'm a marvel"
Looking at these jive turkeys thinking "I'mma carve you"
I'mma hurt you if I catch you out here after curfew
Real niggas stand up, spend your money, argue
This time is for the uninvited
Somebody's pocket got a gun inside it
Who catch Laryngitis?
Black Thought spit shit sicker than everybody
If you ain't already know, you fin to hear about it
