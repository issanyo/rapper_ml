[Philip, spoken]
Look: Grandpa's in the paper!
"War Hero Philip Schuyler in Danger of Losing Senate Seat to Young, Upstart Aaron Burr..."
[sung}
Grandpa might lose his seat in the senate...!
[Eliza]
I thought he was unopposed?!
[Philip]
Not according to the paper, he isn't!
[Eliza]
Go make sure the door is closed!

[Philip]
Further down
[Eliza, Philip]
Further down!
[Philip]
See Schuyler has a challenger from New York!
[Eliza]
New York!
[Eliza, Philip]
For senator:
Burr!

[Eliza]
I gotta go
I gotta find Alexander!
[Philip]
Tell him we're on his side!
[Eliza]
No...
He'll consider this a
Personal slander!
I've gotta stop a homicide!
[Philip]
Oh!
[Eliza]
Look around!
[Eliza, Philip]
We should look around!
[Eliza]
Let's go and find your father
Down in New York!
[Philip]
New York!


[Hamilton]
Burr!
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?!
[Burr]
Since being one put me on
The up 'n up again!
[Hamilton]
No one knows who you are
Or what you do-!
[Burr]
They don't need to know me
They don't like you!

[Hamilton] Excuse me?!
[Burr] All of Wall Street thinks you're great
You'll always be adored by things you create
But upstate you're the rascal who trades away the capital
[Hamilton]
Wait-
[Burr]
The asshole who taxes the a-a-alcohol
[Hamilton]
I've always considered you a friend!
[Burr]
I don't see why that has to end!
A senate seat was up for grabs
And I took it!
It's not my fault people think you're crooked!

[Hamilton]
You're gonna make a fool of me through my father-in-law?!
[Burr]
There's the kid who almost shot Charles Lee in the jaw!
My God
You're pride will be the death of us all
But beware! it goeth before the fall!

[Eliza]
Alexander, there you are!
[Hamilton]
Eliza?!
[Eliza]
You forgot your papers
Mr. Burr, good sir
It's been so long!
How are the Theodosia's?
[Burr]
As a matter of fact
My wife has taken ill
[Eliza]
I'm not surprised
What with the chill!
You'll send her our regards?
[Burr]
I will

[Eliza]
And how's your daughter?
[Burr]
She's my pride and joy! Fluent in French & Latin!
[Philip]
Well, so am I!
[Burr]
She's the same age as your boy!

[Hamilton}
Yeah, one day he'll run Manhattan-!
[Eliza]
We must be going, sir
But send your girls our love!
[Burr]
Nice to meet your son!
[Hamilton]
Mister Burr, we're not done!

[Eliza]
Hun...

[Burr]
If I were you
I'd stick with her
Sir!
