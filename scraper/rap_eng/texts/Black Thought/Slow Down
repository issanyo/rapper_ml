Yeah

[Verse 1: Chiddy]
Hey, I’m the man, right? So I think I’m gon’ live it
Since my mother birthed me I have only been exquisite
And I was on the grind while you was gettin’ the digits
Got this down to a science, you would swear I’m livin’ physics
But my life is different, what good is the success?
If the happiness is missin’, 3:30 I am dismissin’
Any competition, cause I gotta eat
You show me a rapper, that’s someone I gotta beat
And most people red-shirt, because they cannot compete
Think and my wing span says anything’s in my reach
When Atlanta was poppin’ BMF with Big Meech
I was stuck in the school, I was more that they could teach
But slow and steady wins the race, thought I was hare
But I’m movin’ at a tortoise pace, and that’s what I prefer
So get a cup and mix it up, and let it go down, I know now
That life feels better when you slow down

[Hook: elDee the Don]
Slow down
Man I gotta slow down
There’s way to many friends that gossip will go round
Wish I woulda knew then what I know now
But for now, life feels better when it’s slowed down
Man I gotta slow down
There’s way to many friends that gossip will go round
Wish I woulda knew then what I know now
But for now, life feels better when it’s slowed down

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Uh, I know it now, wish I knew it then
Diminished returns, I burned through a few of them
Remember when I was in a position you were in
Shit'd be different if I had it all to do again
Oh, to be new again, young upstart
From the rough part, tryna make his dreams come true again
I watched gold disappear while pursuin’ it
Seen cats capture the flag, then let it ruin them
A grasshopper tryna learn kung fu again
It’s deja-vu livin’ shit I been through again
A little word from the wise, remain true within
This is from a boss, look at where the Root’s crew has been
Yeah it’s true I got the soul of an old town
And real talk, that what come around go around
Before the drama get to large to hold down
It’s in your best interest to try to slow it down

[Chorus]
.

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Hey I’m sorry I took long, you probably could swell me sooner
And let me take the time out to dispel the rumors
Chiddy Bang still here
Keep it rollin’ like a victim in a wheel chair
I’m tired of everybody that be gossipin’
They want to know if we making what we be profitin’
Snoop Dogg, nowadays I sip a lot of gin
And at this altitude I’m kinda low on oxygen
Maybe I need to breathe, it’s all or nothing when you’re nothing at all
That’s the reason I’m so excessive when I’m up in the mall
Why’s it takin so long? I got cribs to get
And don’t I lay my plot down like arithmetic
Uh, I said I done it here and south mon is here
I was born to do this you don’t need to check my Punnett square
So get a blunt of what you want and let it go round
And know now that life feels better when it’s slowed down

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chiddy]
And I’mma make it to the stars with the bars
Yellow brick road, my life the Wizard of the Oz
I know gettin’ that job is always gonna be hard
But for now, we gonna plot to take over the world
And I’mma make it to the stars with the bars
Yellow brick road, my life the Wizard of the Oz
I know gettin’ that job is always gonna be hard
But for now

[Outro: elDee the Don]
Life feels better when it slows down
