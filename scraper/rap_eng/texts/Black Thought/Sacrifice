[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Get phobic off of this like we was a arachnids
Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's pro blackness
Grown man tactics, no pediatrics
It's the kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst thought with a knack for splashing them
Dashing and I mastered the craft I'm mashing
The level headed, the thoroughbred, the females passion
Magnetic attraction, keeping them asking
And cruise in the Cadillac with the Pendergrass in
Swerve half-naked wouldn't come near crashing
If I go to Heaven
Would you all know my name
Or would it be the same
For you like I was Eric Clapton
Clap for your freedom dog that's what's happening
My spits critical, political action
The hustle
Is a puzzle
Each piece is a fraction
Every word is understood as a transaction
I'm a SP soldier
Microphone holder
Rep Philly set from Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to Tip and Tioga
How are we going to make it through the dark I'll show you all

[Hook: Black Thought &
Let me tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you've got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you could fly

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Kick off you shoes and jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes from off your block
My name Black the style is unorthodox
It that tens in your mens you thought you bought
Couple people want the thought to stop but guess what
My man grabbed the nistol plugged for the gut
Now next time pity stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on them with toast but no crust
It fructose on them they froze and won't bust
It's yolk on your face your jewels is lack lust
To put it to you straight you fools is jacked up
Came close to the utmost but no cigar
Nose to the grindstone head to the stars
Number one runner number one drummer
Number one squad we the joint for this
For real

[Hook: Black Thought &
Let me tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you've got to cry
[Work it out yo]
You need a heart that's filled with music [yo]
If you use it you could fly

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
[Check it out yo]
Your first impression might be I'm an asshole
Say that I'm sum-timing you and give people a hassle
Try to sun touch you and put the heat in a capsule
Yo see I'm deeper than that though I get in a zone
Recognize I am a rolling stone
No time to lally-gag or lounge with scholly wag
Give the disco I will put it where your body is at
I got the spit flow I lay it over trolley track
With no apology for all of the tricknology
Just trust what I see and I see you follow me my way
I am the open book look inside me
The star of the story the groove telling Godly
All of the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My mic a make a man a newborn infant
That truth so the truth going to sense it
I get in a zone

[Hook: Black Thought]
I tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile [check it out] you've got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you could fly

[one more time come again with that]

I tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to be something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you've got to cry
[All my peoples just work it out
Come on come work it out]
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you could fly
