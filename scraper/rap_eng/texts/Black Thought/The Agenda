[Black Thought]
The world traveler, yeah, Bad Lieutenant, Fifth Dynasty
We get the party live, word is bond, check this out, The Agenda
Yanamsayin'? It's like this

[Hook]
The Agenda for the moment, seek surrender from opponent
Recruit more for student enrollment
I travel the globe 'cause I own it
Yo, you don't want it, you don't want it
You know you really don't want it
The Agenda for the moment, seek surrender from opponent
Recruit more for student enrollment
I travel the globe 'cause I own it
Akh, you don't want it, we confront it
You know you really don't want it

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Check it out, my job description is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
The crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin' out "The Roots" while I'm balanced on the mic wire
An expert at this profession of the sound session
In '87, I linked up with Question
Eleven years later, we shared crop from Geffen
In a musical hell, but hip-hop's forever heaven
My thoughts interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This fowl world so full of shit, it's like a backed-up colon
That's swollen with minds that got stolen
Fake police chiefs can't control their patrolmen
The torture, blood flow like bodies of water
And fathers sexually assault bodies of daughters
It's out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
Within the hustle of the unseen hand that holds trouble
In the game of life, it's difficult to roll a double
When tryin' times take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms "Fuck you"
Under they breath, we're livin' in the last times left
Peep the imagery that's stretched across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous brush strokes of darkness
Time to hold it down, let's spark this

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, my definition is a lyricist for hire
You couldn't have a clue what's about to transpire
The books I buy is like arms I acquire
The Fifth similar to ghetto gospel choir
We explore the whole states plus abroad
In flight once, I dreamed I was a prisoner of war
Four corner corridor, ceilin' without floor
From what I could see, the drop was like a mile or more
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes, I said "I don't got 'em"
I guess it kinda presented a problem
From what I understood, they said "Let him go"
I woke up durin' descent into London Heathrow
An hour done passed fuckin' with border patrol
Finally got out, I'm linkin' with my people
To the studio to spread the information
'Cause in days of frustration, it's time for education
From Oakland to Osaka destination
The Roots be du journ, kid, check the translation
In the dictionary of hip-hop topics
Far from ebonics, murder with haikus and sonnets
Yo, my Philly squad keep it ???
While the unaware proceed to take heed
Yanamsayin'? Word is bond, on and on and on
Ain't another contender

[Hook x2]
