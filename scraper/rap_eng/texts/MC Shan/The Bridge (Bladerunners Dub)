M TOP - MAX... - MC Shan Lyrics - The Bridge Lyrics

Amazing!
Young and Sexy

After Shower Thoughts
Pen Spinning
Ladies and Gentleman

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight

They just came from off tour and they wanna tell you a little story

About where they come from

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)

Queensbridge

You love to hear the story again and again

Of how it all got started way back when

The monument is right in your face

Sit and listen for a while to the name of the place

The Bridge(scratched) (3X)

Queensbridge

Hip hop was set out in the dark

They used to do it out in the park

Every place they said his name it rang an alarm

Otherwise known as Mean Teen Tom

A brother whose known for his rap

Jabby Jack, Larry Laughter and least not last

A cool brother by the name of Gas

These brothers made you get loose

They was down with a brother called Cousin Bruce

They used to jam in the center

You had to pay so you could enter

Go to the door

Get frisked

Just in order to get in

And if you wasn't from this town

Then you couldn't fight and win

But everytime they had a jam

They couldn't get no peace

So that's why the jam's out there

And the parks they had to cease cause you was in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)

Queensbridge

Why don't you wise up

Show all the people in the place that you are bright

Make this here one jam that you do not start no fight

Cause that is one thing that we all must see done

And if you start some shit you're ass had better run

Cause you're in

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)

Queensbridge

Dimples be the girl, she was great

Her and Marley Marl went and cut a plate

They used to rock it out in the place

And the title of it was sucker dj's

And then he strolled along one day

And then he walked into a girl named Shante

Third in line you know its me

MC Shan ha ha in the place to be

MC Man he made them beg

He is the man who is known as Craig

The newest member out to get loose

Now he is down with us and he got the juice

This is the place where stars are born

And we are the only ones that can't be worn

Out

By any place any part of the world

And while i'm out on tour keep your hand off my girl

When she's in

The Bridge(scratched) (8X)

Queensbridge

Dead dreams, bought and sold

You gotta try and receive your goal

However you do it however you're made

Don't ever listen to what ? say

Cause I will tell you the deal

You gotta go by what your heart feel

Cause if you don't you'll be misled

By stupid little things put inside your head

Or someone else that you will see

Their trying to live your destiny

By the time you think about it your grown

And then you gotta say god damn I gotta leave my home

Grab hold of your heavy chain

Rich people always pullin always trying to restrain

You heard just what I said

They're always pullin ya back when you wanna get ahead

They pull you back cause their not wit it

You're talking about school

Their talking about quit it

Soon you'll see that time just fly

Cause you spent most of it out gettin high

Thought about it much, much later

Could've went to school and been much greater

But you chose to lead that fate

Now you're sucking on a bone when it should've been steak

The whole purpose of the story I told

Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goals

Stop walking through life as if you are blind

You should reach for your goal cause i'm reaching for mine

And i'm from

The Bridge(scratched) (4X)

Queensbridge

Keep on rockin

The bridge

Will keep rockin

If the beat stop rockin

The bridge will keep rockin

If the beat stop rockin

The bridge will keep-a rockin

Till the beat stop rockin

The bridge will keep-a rockin

Till the bridge stop rockin

The kids will keep-a rockin

When the bridge stop rockin

The bridge will keep-a rockin

If the kids stop rockin

The bridge will keep-a rockin

Till the beat stop rockin

The bridge will keep rockin

Ladies and Gentleman

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight

Ladies and Gentleman

We got MC Shan and Marley Marl in the house tonight

They just came from off tour and they wanna tell you a little story

About where they come from

They just came from off tour and they wanna tell you a little story

About where they come from

(Music plays until end)
