Here's a real sad song
A song that must be sung
Think about the days when we were young
When we were kids girl all you wanted to do was play
But that was then and look at how you're living today
It's making me sad and almost brings me tears
But you may just open your eyes when the smoke clears
Girl what happened to the smile that used to clean
Once upon a time in your life you used to dream
At the top of the swim team but now you're drownin'
How quick your change was the most astounding
What you're gonna do is you against the world
You started off being such a sweet girl
Times go by, and years they start to drift
Now you're staring down a deep cliff
You can pour but don't overflow the cup
Girl you better

[Hook]
Ease up
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down (ease up)
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down

No longer kids now we're considered as teens
Now we start learning what the letters in life mean
You had a good home living the good life - who knows
You might have made somebody a good wife
How is it wrong when things which are so fun
Now you walk around with a body with no mind
You entered the gateway to all life choices
Your brain was kinda hollow so you followed the voices
And you let it mislead ya
It took your body and soul and it said that it freed ya
Each and every girl like you is a sad case
You always have a beautiful look on a sad face
It could never be the way that it was
But if you're on the dope then that's what the dope does
If you pour don't overflow the cup
Girl you better

[Hook]
Ease up
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down (ease up)
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down

And now it comes to the final solution
Robbing and stealing and prostitution
Can't you see that your world is a shamble?
Life is a big game with plenty of gambles
So much time many things that are undone
No longer you cause there's you and a young son
You got one there are girls with two or three
Can't get a fix on 'em it's driving 'em up a tree
Just stop and think of your young child
Before he winds up as a name in a closed file
As I reminisce and take a look back
I wish I knew what to do to put you on the right track
But yet the train that left the station
And your money's on a permanent vacation
The more you pour you overflow the cup
Girl you better

[Hook]
Ease up
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down (ease up)
So down
Girl you better change your life around (ease up)
So down
