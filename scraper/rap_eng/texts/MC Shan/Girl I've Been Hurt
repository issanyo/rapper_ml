[Intro]
Girl I've been hurt
Girl I've been hurt

[Verse 1]
You said there will be no other love
But me but girl I know much better
I'm no fool; you've been playing games on me
Come here tell me what you're thinking of (of)
Is he real, have you found another love?
How long must we play this masquerade?

Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'
Girl I've been hurt now I need another lover
You are no'

[Verse 2]
Who do you think you are?
Let me tell ya about it
Who do you think you are?
Girl is there something you should tell me
Cause you've been acting kinda strange lately
But I already know what's been going on
I'm in love but love it doesn't blind me
Now I'm moving on and leaving you behind me baby
I have to go I just can't take it any more
