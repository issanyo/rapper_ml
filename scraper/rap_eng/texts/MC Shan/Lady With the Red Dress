[Verse 1]
Spotted her the very second as she turned her head
I looked deep into her eyes
Caught a vision of love (caught a vision of love)
She was all so fine and all so sweet
I had to find a way to make her mine
(gotta make her, gotta make her mine)
I stepped off to her very smooth
Hoping that she would approve
Now's the time to make my move
(now's the time to make my move)
I said hello she said goodbye and walked away
I don't wanna give up I'm hooked on you
I wanna know if it's really love or infatuation
The way I feel about you

[Hook]
Lady with the red dress on
I love to be your man (I wanna be your man)
And take you into my world (ski dum dum)
Hey I'll show you lots o' surprise
And make you hypnotised
And then you will be my girl
Lady with the red dress on
I love to be your man (I wanna be your man)
And take you into my world (ski dum dum)
Hey I'll show you lots o' surprise
And make you hypnotised
And then you will be my girl

[Bridge]
I walked up to her very smooth (ly)
Hoping that she would approve (me)
Now's the time to make my move
(now's the time to make my move)
I said hello she said goodbye and walked away
I don't wanna give up I'm hooked on you

[Verse 2]
A little lady with the lady with the red dress
I don't know who you are but darling, I'm really impressed
Let's discuss it over dinner and wine
I have a million of different a-ways for us to unwind girl
I just wanna bring out the romance in you
Don't get me wrong you're the song I'm dancing to
And no reply all she added was jest
Me I gonna find an-an-another lady with the red dress on
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
Lord?

[Hook]
Lady with the red dress on
I love to be your man (I wanna be your man)
And take you into my world (ski dum dum)
Hey I'll show you lots o' surprise
And make you hypnotised
And then you will be my girl
Lady with the red dress on
I love to be your man (I wanna be your man)
And take you into my world (ski dum dum)
Hey I'll show you lots o' surprise
And make you hypnotised
And then you will be my girl
