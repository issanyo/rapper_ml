Now, this is what happened but I wasn’t upset
See, it all started with this girlie I met
I really liked this girl, but she made me sad
‘Cause she almost made me trick off every dime I had
Now listen to this story that I have in store
‘Cause it talks about this girl you mighta met before
See, I was chillin’ at a party, I was out gettin’ loose
When me and this young lady was first introduced
She was lookin’ so sweet, a glitter came to my eye
They said they’d call sucker if I let her pass by
What I felt inside from that very first night
We were a perfect couple ‘cause she made me feel right
From that day, all my hopes and dreams were lost
The more she came around, the more she started to cost
Then she got me to the point, I feel so down
Each and every time that she wasn’t around
Well, lotsa times when she’s around, I often sigh
‘Cause she had me in control and I didn’t know why
I shoulda cut her off, that woulda been smart
But I found it really hard for us to part
With a heart as cold as mine, I feel that’s a shame
Every time I turn my back on her, she called my name

(Shan) (repeated a bunch of times)

I would always regret the first day we met
I wanted her so bad, she had me dripping with sweat
Every time I came home, she had me tricking my pay
And when I told her that I love her, she had nothing to say
She drove me so crazy, stone outta my mind
She beat me so bad, my rent was months behind
I finally see she had me caught in her own little way
So I tried to get her back just by staying away
But when I used to feel good, she had me singing her chant
See, I tried to stay away but I found that I can’t
I went to see her, copped a plea, why I don’t have a friend
You do me right, my love, that’s why I’m back to see you again
All the days that I was gone, I was going through hell
My heart was beating so fast, my head started to swell
When I was by her side, I felt so secure
When I met this young lady, she was nice and pure
I don’t know what her reaction was on some
But when I kissed this girl, my mouth went numb
Now, from that point, I should have known
But my love for this girl since the day has grown
Girls like this are one of a kind
She’ll free your soul and clear your mind
Stay away from this girl, take my advice
She’s as pure as snow, her heart is cold as ice
I was under spell, she had my brain
Don’t you know by now that her name was cocaine

Stay away from this girl if you wanna stay sane
She’ll pick your pockets and damage your brain
Girls like this really ain’t no joke
She’ll only be yours ‘til the day you go broke
If you see her on the streets, don’t give her a grin
‘Cause it won’t be long before she sucks you in
So before you have a problem that you can’t solve
With tricky girls like this, don’t you get involved
‘Cause it will be a short time and you will be through
There’s no tellin’ what reaction she could have on you
To some, this girl is just a passing phase
And she’s even made some cold change their ways
From doctors, studying the medical books
Into big time liars and petty cash crooks
She doesn’t know when to stop, she'll take things too far
You’ll be pawning your gold as well as selling your car
She’ll be your friend, oh me, oh my
Up until the day that the well runs dry
That’s right, you heard just what I said
‘Til the well runs dry or your ass drops dead
She’ll change your life, you’ll say ‘dag-nab-it’
She’ll just turn out to be another bad habit
So please take heed to the things I’ve said
And never let this girl mess with your head

Stay away from this girl if you wanna stay sane
She’ll pick your pockets and damage your brain
Girls like this really ain’t no joke
She’ll only be yours ‘til the day you go broke
