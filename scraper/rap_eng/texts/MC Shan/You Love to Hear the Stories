"This is the place where stars are born"
"The Bridge, Queensbridge"

[Poet]
Y'all niggas love to hear the stories again and again
Of how it all got started way back then
See it was Marley, MC Shan, the Juice Crew
Queensbridge, hip-hop land, those niggas blew (up)
Nobody said it started there
But some playa hater tried to end the party there
Niggas didn't care they burned it, put it in the air
I took it personal readied up for warfare
Shit, yeah, what?
But time passed by, shit died out
But niggas got paid off my hood no doubt
Now everybodies rhymin', other hoods start shinin'
That's aight 'cause the Bridge'll keep risin'

"You love to hear the stories again and again
Of how it all got started way back when"
"The Bridge, Queensbridge"
"Screwball drops the illest shit"

[Poet]
And just when you thought things couldn't get betta
Nas dropped Illmatic and let'cha'll faggots have it
He brought the shine back, made the right contact
Had the whole world sayin' "Hey dun, rewind that" (Rewind that)
Niggas from every hood felt the new vibe
The word spread quick, the Bridge is still live
My dun went gold, then he went platinum
My niggas Mobb Deep had the streets right afta him
OH MY GOD, shits off the hook now
Killing kids, in the Bridge carry rap books now
Another chapter about to dominate
I guess it's just in our nature, Queensbridge gotta set it straight
We on some kamikaze shit, moving at a Cormega pace
Infamous Mobb up in this rap race
This is the place where stars are born
Im'a stay reppin' my hood until Im'a dead and gone

You still walkin' through life like you was blind
Need you a lucy but you short one dime
Damn, thought about it, ten minutes later
Bumbed a cigarette going up in the elevator

[MC Shan]
Dead dreams, more than sold
You've got to try and receive ya goal
However you do it, however you may
Don't never listen to what nobody say, uhh
But you chose to lead that fate
Now you're sucking on a bone when it should'a been steak (steak)
The whole purpose of the story I told
Was mainly to inspire you to reach your goal
Stop walking through life as if you were blind
You should reach for your goal 'cause I'm reaching for mine
You love to, you love to
