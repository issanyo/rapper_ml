Where I come from, we never heard of bite
We can write the freshest rhymes at the speed of light
All my planet, we're the real McCoy
And it's you Earth MC's that I wish to destroy
When I rhyme I'm never out of place
I take you on a voyage through outer space
Every rap I make, you know it always sells
I fly the galaxy wearin’ laser CAZALs
I can fly from place to place quicker than you can snap
I'm known as the space wizard of rap
Dependin’ how I feel, if it's only for fun
I take my mic off of 'kill' and I set it to 'stun'
Sometimes my rhymes do inflict pain
Sends electrical impulses through your brain
In your Earthling ears my rhymes are caught
Transmitted to your brain is what's known as thought
I can see the devastation as I look in your face
Listen to how the deejays rock up in space

I can see the devastation
I can see the devastation as I
Look in your
Devastation as I look in your space
Listen

Call yourself MC, are you out of your mind?
You have to have a golden voice that shines like mine
But when you have a jam that is cold set
You play the same old records, one right after the next
For you to win the battle, Earth will have no chance
With the spinning of two records, and you call that advanced?
To do that on my planet you'd be taking a risk
Because the beats we play are live, and it’s not on a disc
The first time that they see it, they might be amazed
And say, "Why should we commit ourselves to primitive ways?"
That's why it is impossible for us to lose
Plug in the microchip of any beat that we choose
One thing where Earth and my people might match
That is the similarity and sound of the scratch

We have stamina, and also have poise
The only difference is the scratch is no sonic noise
To take Earth MC's out is what I wish to achieve
Once this is accomplished I’ll be destined to leave
When I leave they'll call me an ace
That cool MC from outer space

Outer, outer, outer
Outer, outer, outer
From outer space
From outer space

Although my color just might be green
I'm the flyest space MC that you ever seen
It might be in your future ‘cause it can't be your past
But the reign of Earth MC's don't have too long to last
All you fresh MC's, you should feel ashamed
They write some rhyming words, you put ‘em down with the game
They get on the mic and be coppin’ a plea
About how good they rock on the M-I-C
On my planet you must take a test
I'm at the top of my class because I'm the best
I use my rhyming skills for what it is worth
That's why I'm here to battle all MC's of Earth
If you take me out, which ain't been done before
You might just start an interplanetary war
The war won't be to kill John and Steven
The whole point of it is to get even
The war's to get even, I will say indeed
And I will come back every year ‘til the day I succeed
I hope I didn't stand here and offend you too much
If you ever wanna battle, then get in touch
So I can come back and diss your face
Pick up the telephone and dial MC Space
