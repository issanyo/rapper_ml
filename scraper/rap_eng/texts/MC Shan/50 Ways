Skiddily diddily boom boom a whop a dung dem
You never know say daddy me snow yes me come back again
Snow that begin a reading for the musical blow-a
Man de sun came down, man de moon came up
Man I'm fun alone me just
Spin on the top a me say working gold

People dem a take over the mind and soul-a
Eat it in a plate a man fe eat it in a bowl
????? deaf music man a hyper volume noise
Skiddily diddily boom boom a whop a dung dem lord
Skiddily diddily boom boom me come back again
Skiddily diddily boom boom a whop a dung dem
You never know say daddy me snow go go go
Run go tell your friend

They said "hey snow man is there something we can do?
To hear another wicked style, yes coming right straight from you?"
They smiled and looked to me, I said there aren't to be
There must be 50 ways to flip a style
There must be 50 ways to flip a style

Speaking of 50 ways, speaking of 50 styles
Flip I'm about to give why so grab a grip
1, 2, 1, 2 check
Step up and get wrapped
Rough rhymes ,nuff respect
Wiggiddi whack styles
De home de home my system
Then speed up stretch 'em out
Toss em up and twist 'em
Rolled up beat cause you can get done true
Flavours, my rhymes are like an ice cream scoop
Boy just stand still face your prosecution
Love to see ya fate, that's your resolution
Wrap us gift rock, concocted of a potion
Rough on the edge jets move like notion
Psychotic murder and maniac rapper killin'
Back when it comes to rap the rapper kazilla
Swift with the gift I make it worth your while
50 ways and 50 styles
