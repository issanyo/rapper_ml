[Verse 5: MC Shan]
If you analyze my style you'll see I'm pure breed Rotweiller
And we could go line per line and match that dollar for dollar
I seems that I spit a luggie every time that I spit
And as the balls flow by it seems the grittier it gets
And in this game you gotta choose between your pride and your chips
Who rides in your whiz and what slides from your lips
And if my shit was any hotter my lungs would combust and explode
And they say the man of steel would never rust and corrode
And still I don't like no informers

[Hook x2: Snow]

A lickety boom boom down
Tective man said daddy me Snow me stab someone down the lane
