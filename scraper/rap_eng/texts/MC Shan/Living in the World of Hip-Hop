There is no implication hip-hop is wrong
Beats tapped out, played back in songs
Consider hip-hop as a verbal sport
It brings pleasure while expressin one frame of thought
Those that don't like it, then you're psychotic
To my point of view hip-hop's exotic
Rhymes being written everytime you blink
With no vital signs of becoming extinct
Try to demolish, it will not be worth
Killing all hip-hop fans on earth
Don't try to compare it, there's no relative
The word to describe hip-hop: creative
Once you're at a party you're in hip-hop's lair
To downgrade art, how could one dare?
Once upon a time they used to play soul
From there they went to rock 'n roll
Rock died down, then along came pop
Now you're livin in the world of hip-hop

I am the creator of my hip-hop style
With a level of college understood by child
Hip-hop is being moved on a one-way course
Up and being led by an unseen force
You try to hold it down, won't be no good
The more it gets exposed, the more it gets understood
It's all fantasy, yet all realistic
Often complicated, other times simplistic
Lyrics so sharp, they can cut like a knife
I'm sworn by oath to the hip-hop life
Less live drums, less guitar strumming
Hip-hop is the life of the up and coming
Not by force, by one's own choice
Persuaded by the beat and the MC voice
There are people who love it across the land
And there are those that think that it should be banned
Well I say I love it, it comes from my heart
Very thankful for the day that it got its start
Now that it got started, you see it won't stop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

The only thing you could do that would make me mad
Is take away my pen and my hip-hop pad
Take that away, I have nothing left
So let it go free or sentence me to death
I know you had troubles with your moms and dad
When you were growin up goin through your childhood fad
Some parents think that hip-hop means
Wearin fat shoe laces and name brand jeans
It really doesn't matter just what you say
Hip-hop will be around till you're old and grey
They're just all lies created by nerds
You think that I'm playin, you mark my words
Just like man sends rockets to Mars
Hip-hop living is ascending to stars
The more it gets accepted, you'll see it won't drop
And you'll be livin in the world of hip-hop

Runnin neck to neck in the music world race
You don't have to listen if it isn't your taste
It's becoming worldwide, internationally known
Have you ever heard the saying 'to each his own'?
People like jazz, cause that's their taste
I prefer crisp highs with an earthquake bass
There are hip-hop songs that make you tense
And then there are those not worth 2 cents
But still hip-hop's gonna make its mark
Cause you used to only hear it in your neighborhood park
To all non-believers, you should know your name
Since the parks, don't you see how far the hip-hop came?
It's been around for years, and you ask yourself how?
For the very same reason that you're listening now
You might have been hooked from the very first line
Cause raps like these cultivate one's mind
One day your resistance level might drop
And you'll admit: it's a world of hip-hop

Straight from the MC's mouth you heard it
You have to bear witness cause you can't convert it
It's based on a beat with a real slight dip
Kool Herc came along and said, "That's hip"
Heads started bobbin, he began to hop
And he said, "Let's call this hip-hop"
