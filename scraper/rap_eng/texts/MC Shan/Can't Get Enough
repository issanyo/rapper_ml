I know with my heart and soul
You are the one to forfil all my needs
And when I'm with you
Don't wanna leave you
And in the night time you're all that I dream

Because I love love
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough 'nough
I love love
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough

She's got the look
Everybody wants to know
But it's me she wants to show
Heart break no more
As I found that special girl
That she brightened up my world
She's mine all mine
She belongs to only me
In my arms she's got to be
You know the score
And when you're not here with me
It makes me want you much more

That's why I want you
I need you
Gotta gotta gotta have you
And that special love
And girl I want you
I need you
I wanted you girl
It's the pleasing of your love love
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough 'nough
I love love
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love but I just can't get enough

I really want, want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough 'nough
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I get lost in your touch

Hey pretty little ??? there you got the look
??? along with mine you got little
Humble me snow and I'm only informer
Well look in your face and break it with the charm
But that is not the reason I would never fall in love again
My mother was a lover and leave him in the end
Playin' on a gorgeous blonde just ?? now
Sing them him ??? I'm about the same book
I hardly ever asked you but only in a favour
???? love it was a while, you sleep before you fail
Otherwise I'd be just like I was back then
Here I here I here I go because

I want you
I need you
Gotta gotta gotta have you
And you're special love
And girl I want you
I need you
I wanna feed you
And girl you know it's love love
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough 'nough
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough?'nough
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough 'nough
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I get lost in your touch touch
I want want
I need need
It's gotta be love cause I just can't get enough!
