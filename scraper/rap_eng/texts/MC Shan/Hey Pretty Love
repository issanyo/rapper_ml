La la la la la la la la la la la
You are an innocent woman
And you need someone who cares
By the look in your eyes I realize
That you are hurt and that's not fair
I'll give you what you want when you need it
You can always depend on me
I'll give you what you need when you want it
I'll bring sun to your cloudy day

Hey pretty love
Is it really love you're feeling for me?
Is it love? is it love?
Hey pretty love
Wrapped up in your arms is where I want to be
I wanna be, I wanna be?

It ain't for the one or the love of the one it's me you out go with
It ain't for the one or the love of the one it's me you out go yeah yeah
It ain't for the one or the love of the one it's me you out go with
It ain't for the one or the love of the one it's me you out go with
If you have experience of this love yet
Don't worry girl and me say don't be afraid
Another bed another sheets as we get wetter
Don't put into ???? come from me a big stain
Put on the money down I say me you I go with
He said daddy me snow I'll give you love that's true
Only for me and me say only for you
Ain't for the one or the love of the one it's me you out go with...

Hey pretty love
In my heart there'll always be a place for you
Be a place, a place for you
Hey pretty love
There is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I wouldn't do, just for you

Me I go some of them once and some of them twice and some then bambino
Some of them once and some of them twice and some then bambino...
When comes love me say no problem
Me love this girl and me say love her so much
He say it terry she have the golden touch
She make me laugh she make me smile
And sometimes yes she makes me blue
But this is what happens with the stuff you go through because
Ain't for the love or the love of the one it's me you out go with...
Oh lord have mercy (wrapped up in your arms is where I want to be)
When you love this girl might go rare to my heart

[Hook]
Hey pretty love
In my heart there'll always be a place for you
Hey pretty love
There is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
Hey pretty love
In my heart there'll always be a place for you
Hey pretty love
There is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
