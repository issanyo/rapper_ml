It might've took a while
But you knew I had to hit you with a brand new funky rhyme
Guess you already know, so I'm ready to go
Marlon, hit me with the beat one time
Right now I'm gonna introduce myself
So y'all know just who I be
All you suckers in the house stay quiet as a mouse
Instead of Shan call me Mr. MC
I'm goin back to the basics

When I was just a young boy, who ever would've thought
I'd grow up to be an MC
But my rhymes are so nice that they paid my price
Because fortune and fame ain't free
These words I'm recitin are written in a style
That you ain't heard in a long time
And a song like this'll make a rapper reminisce
About the days when he was in his prime
I ain't never lost no battles yet
What made you think I would?
How many times does it take, all the rappers I break
And you still don't think I'm good
This girl in my class tried to move too fast
When she tried to pull down my zipper
Well, things got strange when the whole scene changed
And I all out tried to strip her
Teacher stepped in between, sent me straight to the Dean
That's where I thought my journey ended
Call your moms up to school, are you some fool?
And forget about bein suspended
You went back to the basics

Here's the story on how I got started
Yes, way back in the day
With my man Infinite, Jazzy [Name], Akim
And fly girl Roxanne Shant
People used to hear that our crew was nice
But rappers just had to be convinced
And those who walked through 12th Street tried to say a rhyme
You seen or heard from em since
We sent em back to the basics

Yes yes y'all, it's like this y'all
MC Shan with a brand new twist y'all
One day when me and Marley Marl was playin in a ditch
We made this jam that we knew would slam
And some day it would make us rich
Marley Marl had B-36 bass bottoms
And he cut you up on the spot
And with my rhymes combined all the papers got signed
And 'The B-B-B-B-Bridge' got dropped
We went back to the basics
