[Verse 1:]
I can’t tell you got other intentions babe
So tell me how it’s going down
You don’t fool me for a minute, babe
I know what you’re all about
Acting so mysterious
Can you look me in the eye
I need some kind of filter
Something on your mind
And I, and I, and I
I know that you’re waiting on me girl
But I see how you try to play me girl
It’s all just a game to you, but baby
We both know you don’t know about the rules

[Chorus:]
Yes, you think you know a thing
Make me throw my hands up
Over my eyes
Go inside
You painted quite a picture
One I can’t get rid of
So I just got my remote and I
Let me change the channel (alright, alright)
Things I cannot handle (alright, alright)
Starting with you, you, you, you

[Verse 2:]
You’re giving me this feeling girl
Chills up and down my spine
Every time I try to leave
You stop me every time
I know I shouldn’t feel this way
Should have seen it from the start
There’s no way that I can stay
I know just who you are
I know that you’re waiting on me girl
But I see how you try to play me girl (try to play me girl)
It’s all just a game to you, but baby (oh baby)
We both know you don’t know about the rules

[Chorus]

[BridgeL[
Said that I didn’t want a piece of you
Said that I didn’t, what you trying to do
Said that I didn’t want a piece of you
Especially in the way you move
Said that I didn’t want a piece of you
Said that I didn’t, what you trying to do
Said that I didn’t want a piece of you
Especially in the way you move

[Chorus:]
The way that you
Make me throw my hands up
Over my eyes
Go inside
You painted quite a picture
One I can’t get rid of
So I just got my remote and I
Let me change the channel (alright, alright)
Things I cannot handle (alright, alright)
Starting with you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
