[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party!

[Rap Verse 1: Terrar aka Pusha-T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be the one you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the go to Impala
Crushin', love my women in couples
Wanna each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shift 'em and shuffle
Love how I twist 'em and tussle
Sex play, next day, call me, uh

[Verse 1: AJ]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I said "Hi...
I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said "No!"
Someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go

(Woman)
Hello?

[Verse 2: Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go

Pharrell, (Backstreet Boys), [Woman]:
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) [Hello?]
Dance (Listen, baby, I'm sorry) [Hello?]

[Rap Verse 2: Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can't relate
I take it aways like two days stays
But look, still hit me on my Two-way page
See, I'm heavy in the streets like a cream Denali
Cold outside? We take trips to Maui
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Company by Clipse, Pusha T and Mali

[Verse 1: Nick]
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out
Just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
And there she was standing in front of me
I said "Hi, I got a little place nearby..."

(AJ)
Gotta go

[Chorus]
Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go

Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go

We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go

(Pharrell)
(Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
We're going to a place nearby (Say what?)
Gotta go (Gotta go!)

(Woman)
Hello?
Hello?

[Outro: Pharrell]
Haha, yeah
Let's party, know why?
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go girl!
