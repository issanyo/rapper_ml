Wise words from a king's son
Don't bring no bitch niggas in your kingdom
And never tell another bitch your income
Cause they only stick around with intentions of getting some
Ha, well I ain't trippin' nun
I ain't a slut but I got "Fuck A Nigga Syndrome"
And cause I'm on the rise like a bench press
They're gripping on my ankles while my eyes on the next step
Its funny how they lie just to impress
"I'm spending money like I print it out my inkjet"
Live from downtown, One King West
Probably with your bitch tryna rip her out them fishnets
Ice in the bezel, lower the thermometer level
I'm not a nigga, I'm a modern day rebel
I run the streets like a don in the ghetto
Cause I got enough bars to put your dogs in a kennel uh!
Shut ya bloodclaat yappin'
Real niggas never jump ship, I been a captain
You making me weak, my stomach cramping
Sad cause I can't even laugh at your funny actions
Well, welcome to Brampton where niggas forget you till something happens
Its cool though
All black two door, the inside is two-toned
Never mix pleasure with business so I've got two phones
I phone when I gotta get my dollas up
But here's my pin shorty, PING me when you wanna fuck
Till then you outta luck, girl I'm on the next flight
Blowing smoke, watching the clouds
Im at the best height!

Bridge:
I gotta make it to the sky before the sky falls
Waiting for my second to  blow!  I'm like a time bomb
I'll trod the world barefoot so I can fly home
You with it or not homie ride out, or ride on

I gotta make it to the sky before the sky falls
Waiting for my second to  blow!  I'm like a time bomb
I'll trod the world barefoot so I can fly home
You with it or not homie ride out, or ride on
Ride on, you with it or not?
Homie ride out or ride on
My nigga ride on, you with it or not?
Homie ride out, or ride on!
