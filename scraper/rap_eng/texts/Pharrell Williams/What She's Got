[Verse 1]
I saw the way you walked
You always talked the talk
You pressed buttons... start a war
With no love for the hypocrite
Saw through all the petty bullshit
When it rains it pours and you're the perfect sign

[Pre Chorus]
... by the bedroom wall
Seeking ... anyone at all
Pin the tail on the man who looks.. dropped the bowl
If you're looking for the one to blame
... and lose my name
I might be the reason but I sure don't feel the same because

[Chorus]
She's got the ...
She's got a loaded gun
... never lose a wager
She knows ...
.... gentleman
... feel the medicine
