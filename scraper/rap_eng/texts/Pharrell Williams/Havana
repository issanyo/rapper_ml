Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
Havana

He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
He said there's a lot of girls I can do with
I knew him forever in a minute
And papa says he got malo in him
He got me feelin' like

Ooh... I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Ooh... and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na-na

Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners
