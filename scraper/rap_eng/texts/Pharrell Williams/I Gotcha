[Intro]
Ho, yeah
You know what it is Lupe
Chicago man
Yeah, man
You know I have you right

[Verse 1]
They call me Lupe
I'll be your new day
They wanna smell like me
They want my bouquet
But they can't
They accented like the UK
Turn that eau de Lupe to
Pepe Le Pew spray
Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me, because it's lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl

[Hook]
You want the flava ma, hey I gotcha
You want the realness, well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit, well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
You know we do it

[Verse 2]
And I'm from Chi-Town
That's where I flies round
Keep some Cartier frames over my eyes now
We used to gangbang a lot of that done died down
Children of the hat tiltin' keepin hope alive now
All with no high, I do it so fly
Banksy's attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of y'all to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves my Levers and my Zests
This takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel, hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge wit it and get a mouth full of soap

[Hook]
You want the flava ma, hey I gotcha
You want the realness, well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit, well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
You know we do it

[Verse 3]
And so to sign off
This beat I rhyme off
Is from Thelonious P and Hugo Mind Boss
You feel it in the air
It's such a fine force
But you don't hear me though
Just like a mimes talk
That's cause I'm in Europe
Me in my French tour
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch I'm watching TV
In my cleanest Maharshi
See the hare is trying to beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
But see my secret's safe, it's in my secret safe
That's in my secret room on my secret base
So from the runner of the FNF crew
Come in hip hop we've come to resurrect you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Hook]
You want the flava ma, hey I gotcha
You want the realness, well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit, well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right
You know we do it

[Outro]
Yessir, FNF
