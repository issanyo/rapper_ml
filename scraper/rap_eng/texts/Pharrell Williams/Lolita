Am I the aim of your fascination?
Am I the eye of your storm?
You call my name like in affirmation
You coming right for my door

With your briefcase and your lust
You're on a schoolboy kind of question
All your big deals in the dust
O-o-oh oh oh
Leave your pin-stripes and your 9 to 5
In my Lolita eyes
Come on let's dirty up your mind
O-o-oh oh oh

Cause maybe I was born to make you run like fire
In your blood, I'm your eternal sun
Maybe I was born to make you do some thing
You've never done, you'll be forever young

I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh

Am I the cause of your sweet salvation?
Am I the answer you seek?
You say it all with no explanation
You want it, dive in so deep

With your briefcase and your lust
You're on a schoolboy kind of question
All your big deals in the dust
O-o-oh oh oh
Leave your pin-stripes and your 9 to 5
In my Lolita eyes
Come on let's dirty up your mind
O-o-oh oh oh

Cause maybe I was born to make you run like fire
In your blood, I'm your eternal sun
Maybe I was born to make you do some thing
You've never done, you'll be forever young

I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
I'm your Lolita
Ooh, oh oh oh oh
