[Intro: Ludacris]
{*dial tone, BEEP*}
Hey, this is Luda, okay?
Look, I need you to do me a huge, favor
Umm, c-can you please take your name, off of your phone?
Umm, my-my girl went through my cell phone and uhh, she may be calling you
So, so if you can please take your name off of that
And And-and just have it as-as a number on the voicemail, okay?
You gotta do this for me, huge, quickly!

[Hook: Ludacris]
So I'm just sittin in this rehab class
Tryin to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question
Like "Ludacris, are you over there sexting?"
Ha ha, O-M-G, L-O-L, K-I-T Smiley faces, X and O's, L-M-F-A-O
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone
My girl went through my cell phone

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
So I'm gettin treated for my sex addiction
In a private clinic and I need you to be sensitive 'bout my condition
Cause I'm in it to win it and I really don't wanna further disappoint my fans
And my teacher's a cougar so I wish she'd lend a helpin hand, a helpin hand
Damn! Calm down, B-B-C T-X-T a M-S-G
After class, come with me
And can I get a little bit of T-L-C?
She reply, "What the fuck? F-Y-I you're gonna flunk S-M-H, it's such a shame You ain't learned a damn thang"

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
So I'm sittin at the crib just chillin and I'm mindin my business
Got a text with a tongue out from a number I didn't recognize, I replied "Who is this?"
Quick back got a hit back Said, "This is Stacy and I been missin you
Had to change my number so I went and got a new phone and a new tattoo" - a what? A new tattoo?
Wow! Aww yeah, hurry quick
Can you send a nasty pic?
So I can see right where it is
And I promise I won't show my friends (yeah right!)
She replied, "Well okay B-T-W, by the way S-M-H, it's such a shame that you ain't learned a damn thang"

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
So I pull up to the club stuntin in a yellow Lamborghiiiiini
Half bent, black tint Five percent make it a little hard to seeeeee me
Stepped out, fresh out
Headed straight for the do' on into the V.I.P.!
Next thing I got a text from a freaky Latina sayin "Is that you I see? Is that you papi?"
So I B-B-M'd, abbreviate
Yup and before the night gets too late
Let me hit you with a little Q&A
Can I tap that ass? T-T-A!
She replied, "It all depends! It's me plus one, can I bring my friend?"
And all I could think was it's such a shame that I ain't learned a damn thang

[Outro: Ludacris]
{*dial tone*}
Look, I told you she's onto us
We probably only have about 24 more hours to live
I'm fearful for my life, and I think you should be fearful for yours
I mean, do you wanna have sex just once more?
Just c'mon, just let me get it in the hole one more time
Hole in one, quickly It'll be huge, huge, trust me
I think we should do it, I mean we're gonna die anyway
Why not, you know? Heh, LUDA!
