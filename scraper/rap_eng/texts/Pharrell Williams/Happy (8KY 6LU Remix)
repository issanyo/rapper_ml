[Verse 1 : Pharrell Williams]
It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Verse 2 : Sky Blu]
I'm a shining star dreaming of a brighter day
Where I can go through the meditation is my hideaway
Mind elevation, getting paid off creation
While all you suckas hating me and Shwayze rocking aces
There is a method to my madness, opposite of sadness
Sometimes its weed, sometimes its a bad bitch
Sometimes its giving somebody hungry a sandwich
The world is so cruel man I dont understand it
People doubted me, people doubted me
By any means necessary I will succeed
Its in my DNA, it's what I breathe, it's what I bleed
And bringing the world together is the legacy I lead

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[Bridge : Pharrell Williams]
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said
Bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down
Can't nothing bring me down, I said

[Hook : Pharrell Williams]
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy) Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
