[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine
That’s my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals

[Verse 1]
Don't be bitter
Hunnie here we are
In the mirror
Yes you just hung up (Just hung up)
Insecurity is doing its job
You are special
Baby you're a one off

[Pre-Chorus]
Time to start loving you
Shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine
That's my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals

[Verse 2]
It's temporary
That’s just how it goes (How it goes)
What I hated, now I love the most (I love the most)
Mother told me don't let nothing stop me (Stop)
Cause ain't no copies
Baby you're a one-off

[Pre-Chorus]
Time to start loving you
Shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you
Loving you, shawty loving you

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time
Wind your body from the bottom
To your crown you're a queen, you're divine

[Bridge]
Yes, you got a right to complain it's true
But look what you're gaining move
This message is saving you
You are in his graces too
The world's entertaining you
Cause they see the day in you
Forget who was playing you
Cause they die in their game too

[Chorus]
Shine the rest of the stars are watching
You're awesome, you're unique for all time (Time, time, time)
Wind your body from the bottom (From the bottom)
To your crown you’re a queen, you’re divine (You're a queen, you're divine)
That’s my goals
Goals, goals, goals
Goals, goals, goals
