(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got him
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

(Verse)
So what you blown a fuse (you blown a fuse)
Well that happens to us all (that
Happens to us all)
When I come with great news (I come with great news)
The day could change (change) change (change) change (change) change (change)

(Verse)
We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin
But all that good energy be your strong
Won’t get away way way way

(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got him
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

(Verse)
Well today the rock star (today the rock star)
Feels like singing the blues
(Feels like singing the blues)
Don’t abandon that song (Don’t abandon that
Song)
‘Cause the view could change (change) change (change) change (change)
Change (change)

(Verse)
We all, of course, been there before
Been there cryin, fightin
But our gravity doesn’t need the earth
Slow balling change (change) change (change) change (change) change (change)

(Chorus)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got him
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way (hey baby!)

(Bridge)
Everything is simply told
What goes around us come back around baby
Everything boomerangs
What goes
Up must come down
Love is won when it’s close
Humility will keep your feet on the ground
So do your thing through the rain
If you understand, won’t you sing with me now?

(Chorus x2)
This rainy day is temporary
The contrast is why we got him
‘Cause sunshine due is just a cloud away way way way way way
Way way way way way way
