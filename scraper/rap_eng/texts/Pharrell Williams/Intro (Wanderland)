[Intro]
What is this?

Hi, welcome
Follow, come in
Okay, single file
Watch your step

Welcome to Kelis' world
You have entered - don't touch that

[Verse]
Yesterday, we were born
We took your stereo, by dawn
In just one day
Through all the scorn, and the hate
We'll penetrate your bones, and (???)
With just one take
And now we're here, let the games
Begin, start, get ready let's play
Who wins this race?

[Chorus]
This is a new beginning
The empire strikes back
Learn from losing
Cherish winning
Forever Star Trak
