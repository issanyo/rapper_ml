LYRICS:

Baby don't you tell me
You don't think about what if's
You don't miss me in your sheets
And you don't think of the things that we've done

Baby don't you tell me
You forgot all of my songs
You got over our love
And you don't cry when you look at our pictures

Baby don't you tell me you don’t want me so
I know you’ve been thinking bout the same old love
Mira que que me gusta decirte amor
Mira que aún me fascinas

Baby I can hear you by the telephone
I know that you want me when you’re by your own
Mira que te pienso cada noche amor
Antes de irme a dormir

I need to tell you
That I’ve been thinking about the way
That I used to kiss you
Cuando te besaba en la boca
I need to tell you
That I’ve been thinking about the way
That I used to love you
Mira mamita sobre la cama
Ay, si supieras
Que yo te sigo esperando
Ay, si supieras
Que yo te sigo amando

Baby don't you tell me
He can love you like I do
He can get you like I do
He can kiss your body to heaven

Baby don't you tell me
You’ve moving on your own
You don't have to let it go
Baby escúchame decir que te quiero

Baby don't you tell me you don’t want me so
I know you’ve been thinking bout the same old love
Mira que que me gusta decirte amor
Mira que aún me fascinas

Baby I can hear you by the telephone
I know that you want me when you’re by your own
Sé que tú me piensas cada noche amor
Antes de irte a dormir

I need to tell you
That I’ve been thinking about the way
That I used to kiss you
Cuando te besaba en la boca
I need to tell you
That I’ve been thinking about the way
That I used to love you
Mira mamita sobre la cama
Ay, si supieras
Que yo te sigo esperando
Ay, si supieras
Que yo te sigo amando
