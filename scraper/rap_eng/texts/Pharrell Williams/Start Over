[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again

[Verse 1]
Let's turn off our phones just for tonight
It's been way too long since it's been just you and I
We got so caught up in life that we lost that fire
Baby, I know we can light it up again

[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)

[Verse 2]
Let's catch the first plane that leaves to the sea
I'll go anywhere just as long as you're there with me
And you see it won't take no time to get back that fire
Baby, I know we can light it up again

[Chorus]
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)

[Bridge]
Fall in love again
Fall in love again
Let's make love again
Let take time to fall in love again

[Chorus]
Won't you sing it with me now?
Darlin', pack a suitcase
Let's get away and start over
Smoke a J by the waves while we sip on some ice cold Corona
Let's take it back in the day to when we first knew it was over
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)
Let's take time to fall in love again
(Take time to fall in love again)
