[Pharrell]
Nigga -
Ain't that a B-I-T-C-H
Look what the boy did hanging with the primates
Ok niggas hope you had your v8s
The ten-milli tag dangling from the PH
They call it cloud city because you can't see Pharrell, but then
I can see Miami through the eyes of a pelican
My pictures pass the [?] like it ain't no budget
Blowing all that sand off that Lou-V luggage
The sand, that's from the Dominican Republic
I went from chopper, boat to boat
Back to chopper like fuck it
C.E.O's gold dig for my nugget
But my minds protected by hammers you can't touch it
Niggas can't do this and that is that
They went from check to check
Nigga I'm Jet to Jet
Can't copy my moves with a stencil or etch-a-sketch
Niggas you ain't even close, Shake it up and reset (Yessir)
I shop till I drop in Roppongi Hills
But don't follow shit, ain't nothin' free chill
If I ask B to blast that gun, he will
Do anything to protect Carolyn's son and these mills
That include aiming where he feel
Had that ass stretched out
Straw-sucking free meals
I am what I am Nigga
Them no Liar
One-point-one stock rims on tires
Ok fuck it, I'm an Enzo buyer


TERIYAKI BABY
