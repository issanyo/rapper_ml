MC in this bitch looking hella flee han
They try to body me but i just respawn
Playa haters dissing don't expect a response
Cause my shit so nice you gona have to rewind

Cause we turn up all day and tweek all night
Lets get fucked up i ain't seen the daylight
Had two bitch kissing so i turned pro gayrights
Ya'll know what they like?
Ay rite?

Mami come and make my day right
Mami mami may i?
Lay it down with your face down in the pillow
She smoking smoking drinking roll my cigarillo
She knows how to get me mellow

Only time people act like themselves is when they got the mask on
I got bitches popping molly putting goose in their tampon
Yeah i got the money so you got something to dance on
So take ya pants off and get hands on!

I spit in her mouth, (Woah-Oh)
Spit on her face, (Yaga-ya, Yaga-ya)
She call me daddy all day
On her knees don't know how to pray
Give me good face I'ma give you good faith
Baby wanna sip sizzurp like every day
Her best friend wanna fist her
They say they real sisters
So I'ma drink my liquor and watch them hoes scissor

TURN ME UP

[Chorus 2]

Dutty wine, duty wine all da time
Baby gurl me love dem thighs
Work it right, work work it right
Baby girl me love them thighs
Work it right, work work it right
Baby girl just do it all all night

[Verse 2]

All me boys unemployed but we still mobbin
Got bitches popping Xans and i feel like bill cosby
I'm in the big body, in the benz rocket
On the Taconic 120 straight zoomin
They asked me hows business?
I said its boomin
Ice on my wrist
But mi tryna get the cuban
My bitch is asian
On the sailor moon shit
Mama mama mama I like the way you moving

I like the way you do dem thangs
Mi like it when you shake it and i see the belly rang
STRAIGHT JIGGLIN
She said I got the pull no magnetism
Shout out semaj he got the baddest women
Shout out miqqy dollas on his permit shit
I fuck a bitch one she think its permanent
Me and JD still swerving in the fit
Cause we too legit, YAYA!

Blow me
No Tuba
Blah Blow me
Like bazooka
She sweet like bubble gum
Girl got a bubble but said she smoke hookah
Handbag be medusa, (Woah-Oh)
Down to screw us in the back of the Uba
Winters in Uruba, Punta Cana
She said she love me, fuck me on camera! (Yagi-ya, Yagi-ya)

[Chorus 3]

Ziggie Zow, Ziggie Zow
Ziggie Zow, Ziggie Zow, (Oh Yeah)

Ziggie Zow, Ziggie Zow

Dutty wine, duty wine all da time
Baby gurl me love dem thighs
Work it right, work work it right
Baby girl me love them thighs
Work it right, work work it right
Baby girl just do it all all night

(Bridge: Beenie Man & Maya)

Angel of my love

Dutty wine, duty wine all da time
Baby gurl me love dem thighs
