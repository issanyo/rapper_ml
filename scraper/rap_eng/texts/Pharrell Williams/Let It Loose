[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So the one's eye has freak don't run
And last but not least please don't tell no one

[Verse 1: Wale]
I just wanna treat you like the woman that you need to be
I be on that Peter Pan that NYC you needin' me, then hit me
Commitment no not really, and shawty don't be silly
We ain't trippin' of the history this a one nighta
And the bitches you fight em, here's some liquor or lighter
If there's no I.D. adios got no interest in minors
I'm on my grown man B.I you see why
Cause these lil broads think its not alright to be bi
I'm messin' with you, you comfortable with it I nevermind
You never play with young boys cause they never private
And they'll forever out ya, that's why you always quiet
The only one that's not patronin' designate your drivin'
Ok just listen up a little
That Nuvo or that goose egg got you losin' your religion
Amen, they say you only live once
So go to work for what you need but I'ma give you what you want

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So the one's eye has freak don't run
And last but not least please don't tell no one
And she gon let it loose, hey
Let it loose (hey)
She want you to stroke her (yea) and have fun

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Now tell 'em
It's in the house, so throw your money in the air and stand in the couch
Laugh at the money that's stuck in the chandelier
Tell them girls right there that the man right here
Tell em
It's in the house, so throw your money in the air and stand in the couch
Laugh at the money that's stuck in the chandelier
Tell them girls right there that the man right here

[Verse 2: Wale]
Is you workin' hard (yeah)
How you get around (car)
Is you getting money (yeah)
Is that money yours (aww)
She don't even need a job, got one anyways
She sit up at her desk on Perez All Day
Then Bossip for gossip, YBF in concrete
Then she on her facebook like when we finna party
Twitter with her homegirls like what we finna do
They like we gon hit the club but can I hold on to your Choos
Ok now everything's wonderful
Thick girls, small frame, please watch ya tummy miss
Free before 12, 11:30 when they go in
And they gon' get a table cause they flirt with the promoter
Vodka and soda, pineapple and patron
Now hold up be a second, and pose for the photo
Pose, click, pose, click
Now say fuck them other bitches them hoes ain't shit

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
All the girls really want is fun
Just a place that they can come
So the one's eye has freak don't run
And last but not least please don't tell no one
And she gon let it loose, hey
Let it loose (hey)
She want you to stroke her (yea) and have fun
