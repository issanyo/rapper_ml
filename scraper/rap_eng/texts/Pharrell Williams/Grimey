Yeah nigga - part four muh'fucker
Thugged out nigga (Grimey)
Neptunes - nigga what nigga (Grimey)
Violator - nigga what nigga (Grimey)
This shit is serious - type serious (Grimey)
Uh, uh-uh, nigga what nigga (Grimey)
Uh, uh-uh, nigga what nigga (Grimey)
Uh, uh-uh, part four nigga (Grimey)
Yo, yo, yo

It's like fuck, it's King Tut jewelry, blind fury nigga
I smoke boogies, conspiracy theory
It's like I'm Malcolm, with just the X
These bitches swear they in love but it's just the X
Niggas act like, my coke ain't long in stress
Like I don't keep two shotguns, under my chest
I flip, obsolete see I'm the king of the streets
And show muh'fuckers how to rhyme on Neptunes' beats
In Miami, Pun shoulda won the Grammy
This year I'll bring the shit home to his family
Go 'head, and keep hatin, until you receive
Mad volts in your chest plate, hard to breathe
See you a hater like Star & Buc, nigga what
And fuck Tommy Boy, them niggas just suck
I'm the ultimate, gun on my dick, hoes swallow my spit
Wanna drink every bottle I sip

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga when that heat, is bustin off
And the ambulance come, and rush you off
And the witness like - we don't know dem boys
Me and my niggas goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey
Then we resume, hangin with stars
Then we live in fat houses and fat ass cars
Then we drive and scream - nigga FUCK the law
Me and my niggas goin hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey

[Noreaga]
Yo, yo
I alternated with the greatest, upgraded my speech
We Violator violatin, y'all niggas capiche?
It's unsafe like late night on Orchard Beach
Drink some river ranches and get slurped at least
Let's have fun wit it, in the Bridge my niggas dunn wit it
Niggas had hit records, but we done did it
Pop a collar; see them chicks they like to holla N.O.!
You know them hoes already know they gotta swallow
Money like Nutty Professor - fat as fuck
Four gold albums; ain't none of it luck
Brad Pitt, Fight Club shit, fuckin you up
Since you, seem so tense release the mutts
I'm connected, the police release my cuffs
Call me Fillmore, naw nigga cause I'mma feel more
Nigga this my year, you gonna feel Nore
Money we got it but still try and feel more

[Hook]

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams (Noreaga)]
Type of niggarole, we must be dunns (Grimey)
Toothbrush shanks and rusty guns (Grimey)
Nigga get popped can't hush me son (Grimey)
Sellin everything 'til they cuff me dunn (Grimey)
93 Ac' fuck a Range nigga (Grimey)
Saliva at the mouth of your chain nigga (Grimey)
Reynolds wrap, coke, and doo-rags (Grimey)
Never cleanin up, nigga screw that (Grimey)

[Noreaga]
You see we unbreakable, y'all niggas is uncapable
We 2G nigga we use gats that's untraceable
Still smokin, and niggas know how I do it
Keep big shanks, shit'll cut in half your Buick
Just me and shorty, late night in the park
And gettin so much brains I'm startin to feel smart
Off Beelzebub, feelin my love with cold heart
See these fake niggas, my fists'll break niggas
We switchin labels, now it's time to break niggas
We switchin labels, now it's time to break niggas

[Bridge]

[Pharell Williams]
Hey, hey, hey, hey-hey hey
