[Intro: Pharrell]
I got an announcement to make, look
This song is for, when you out with your boys late at night
You been drinkin', the party is crazy
I don't wanna offend nobody, who care

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Girl I wanna feel it
Tonight I need some pussy pussy pussy when we get home
Girl I wanna feel it, yeah
Tonight I need some pussy pussy pussy that's all I want

[Verse 1]
I rub ya from ya breasts to ya buttocks
I know you feel it in ya stomach but
Sweetheart stop runnin', relax girl
You gotta calm down in order for you to start cummin'
I can't help it if I break down walls and lay down laws
You never made love on a bearskin rug?
With a real gangsta hittin' it from the back with a dutch lit up
I enjoy havin' sex in the strangest places
From the counter-top in the kitchen, to the washin' machine in the basement
I like all flavors, every pussy's pink, and I'm not a racist
So baby don't think I won't taste it
Only if you suck me first I'll make spines hurt
You'll be swearin' to God so much the neighbors'll think they in church girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna take all your time, only want you for one night
Dick sucks, everything, weed and [?]
I like it when I slide in it in the beginnin', when ya muscles are tense
Until I spread ya legs makin' you beg
The sparks we create, I'll make sure I cum late
Multiple orgasms makin' you shake
You callin' your girlfriends givin' up tips
[?]
Mercenary makin' a funny face and I
Stay wit' protection, invest in a shotgun
In other words my penis in a condom
Because when it comes to the ladies, I'm like a bitch stuck to a [?]
A sucker for you shits kick it like judo keep it playin' baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So you like it hard huh?
I dig you down in a graveyard
On top of a tombstone that's what ya call gettin' boned dog
I'm into ballin', not in into relationships
I find it appallin', so I won't be callin' you bitch
We both got our nut off, it was nice for one night
But I can't stand the same pussy twice baby girl get lost
Don't allow yaself to get tossed
That shit'll get back to my wife and we can both go on about our lives
Rosco P's for playa, I talk nasty and sweat out weed
I'm into poppin' cherries and bucklin' knees
I'm a freak, you smoke weed? Take a hit of this dick
What you say baby you can't breathe because I'm holdin' yo head?

[Chorus x2]
