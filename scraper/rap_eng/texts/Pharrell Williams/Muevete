There's three little words that I'd like you to know.
And once you have learned them, we're ready to go
They're manos, cabeza, pies
That's hands, head, and feet
Manos, cabeza, pies
Repeat!
ALL: Manos, cabeza, pies
It's manos, cabeza, pies!
That's hands--
Rosita: Head--
Elmo: And feet
Now I want you to start moving them all to the beat
Here we go!
Muevete, muevete
Move your hands and head and feet
Muevete, muevete
Move them all around to the sound of the beat
Mueve las manos, mueve los pies
Mueve la cabeza, empieza otra vez
Move your hands and head and feet
Move yourself around to the sound of the beat
Manos, cabeza, pies
Manos, cabeza, pies
Yes, moving around you can never go wrong.
But now I have come to the end of my song.
Muevete!
