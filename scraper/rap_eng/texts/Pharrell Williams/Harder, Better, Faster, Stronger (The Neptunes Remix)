[Verse 1: Daft Punk]
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger
More than, hour, our, never
Ever, after, work is, over
Ever, after, work is, over
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger
Mone than ever, hour after, our work is never over
Work it harder, make it better, do it faster makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after, our work is never over

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
They say the soul snatcher's coming
To snatch our spirits from the club so we can
Get away, get away, get away
For all those caught up in the hatrix
And not tryin' to practice love, we can
Get away, get away, get away
Gotta build our records stronger
Make them faster for the show, we can
Get away, get away, get away
Come on let's fly to Paris
The city in the bubble, so we can
Get away, get away, get away
