[Chorus]
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)

[Sheek Louch]
Yo, since the Mona video, you been trackin' me down
Tryin' to figure out how I look in person now, baby
Forget looks; tell me can you roll with crooks?
The three hot niggas rising in the Billboard books, nigga
We look at things through the big lens, big picture
Big Benz, we try and make CEO ends
Them thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas
We Cristal niggas, y'all Nestl√© Quik style niggas
You didn't love me when my name was Sean
Now you should see how bitches act when Benjamins come on
But I ain't hatin' 'em, you gotta love the ways females play
Quick to use a negligee to get a getaway
Five stars where the Willies stay, and Sheek pay for nothing
But that's what y'all herbs get for frontin'
I spend wild chips gettin' drunk up in the China
Club, while you up in Skate Key wit' a minor

[Styles P]
I know she wit' it, I bet a brick I could hit it
Black tie affair, I got a fresh pair of British
Iceberg shirts wit' ice along wit' it
Turquoise 9-11 Porsche and it's tinted
But honey got a lot of jazz, you got a Phillie
You got a bag? Then she went inside the Prada bag
Blew two and she said it was choice
Like my voice, my thug style made her cat moist
That's the realest shit I heard, that's my word
Regardless who she fucked, I'm the nigga she deserves
I put her on the whole in birds, rockin' furs
Different ways to speak without using words
And even though she proper I still gotta drop her
'Cause Sheek don't like her, had a dream that he shot her
I can't buy you Escada, you get nada
I'ma bounce with a chick that look a little bit hotter

[Chorus]
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, they was never mine for me to dump 'em
It's just like checkers, after they make a move then I jump 'em
It's like this, girlfriend, I'ma keep it real
Every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm caked up with whips
But guess what? I got more nuts than chips
And they gon' melt right in your mouth, not in your hand
You know that you ain't my girl, I'm not your man
But do you still wanna lick me?
Or is it 'cause I'm a six figgy niggy, and I know Biggie
And I don't mess with no fat ladies
But if you pay like you weigh then you can stay, baby
PJ slide to the mo' like that
With this honey named Trial 'cause she blow like that
And when we finish, don't look at me like I owe nothin'
'Cause if you really dig me, let me know something

[Chorus]
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)

[Styles P]
Pissy drunk, laid out in the V.I.P., can't talk about a 3 on 3
Heard a freak ask Sheek, "Big Louch, why don't you pee on me?"
And her friend is tellin' J, "I hold a key on me"
And I'm laughin' to myself, I got a key on me
And they friend in my ear, like Lean On Me
Told to get some barebacks and cream on me

[Sheek Louch]
Yeah, Sheek holler to these mamis, "Ven aqui"
Gas 'em up easily and take 'em home with me
Boo respect this, can't keep her hands off my necklace
If it's good, next week I'll put her on the guest list

[Jadakiss]
This goes out to all y'all
There's too many names to call but y'all know who y'all are
See me at the bar all eyes on the R
O-L to the E-X, sippin' Henny and VS
112 sex styles, baby
Maybe we can fall in the L.O.X. files
You betta believe we all scorin', yeah
We can dance all night and do whatever all mornin', ha ha, yeah

[Chorus]
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)

You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
You think I'm jiggy? (Yeah)
You think I'm sexy? (Yeah)
Come on (Let's go)
Come on (Let's go)
