Hey there, boy, tell me what's your name?
Feel the pulse of my heart deep desire
I'd be happy to play your game
One dance can set this night on fire

Wanna be close to you
Don't care what we do
I ain't got nothing to lose
The willpow-willpower
If you dare me to
I get a run next to you
If you were here in my shoes
You'd need some willpow-willpower
Willpow-willpower

Hey there, boy, won't you lean on in
Find your way to me here in the dark
Can't you feel my lips whispering?
Right there is a good place to start

Wanna get close to you
Don't care what we do
I ain't got nothing to lose
The willpow-willpower
If you dare me to
I get a run next to you
If you were here in my shoes
You'd need some willpow-willpower
Willpow-willpower

Gonna slow it all down tonight
Gonna make you feel alright
Gonna wish for one more night
Get it right, hold you tight

Hey there, boy, won't you lean on in
Find your way to me here in the dark
Can't you feel my lips whispering?
Right there is a good place to start

Wanna get close to you
Don't care what we do
I ain't got nothing to lose
The willpow-willpower
If you dare me to
I get a run next to you
If you were here in my shoes
You'd need some willpow-willpower
Willpow-willpower
