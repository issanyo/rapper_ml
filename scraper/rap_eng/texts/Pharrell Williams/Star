(Malice)
What we had was a thing of the past
And I recall showering you with gifts, you never had to ask
Thought love was real
Damn near gave you my last, bracelets with the karats
Purchasing class, that was me
Now you're alone and empty, bitter
To put it simply, I know you miss me
And that must be a hard pill to swallaw
I feel for your man, I'm a hard act to follow

How I  find the time to think of what we had before
When everybody I know in dancing on the floe
Since you left the time has been so slow
Well, let it come out of my mind, where else can it go

(bridge)
See I need you boy
I honestly feel I can't bare my health
See I need you boy
That's probably why I dance with myself

(chorus)
You're my star (my star)
It's such a wonder how you shine (ooh)
So no matter how far (no matter how far you go)
I'm dancing with you in my mind ( yeah, yeah)

Baby its cool with me, you left, ran off with friends
I bet I know it won't be long until its on again
We got harmony to every note
We can palm a physic if you like, whatever floats ya' boat

(bridge)
See I need you boy (mmm)
I honestly feel I can't bare my health
See I need you boy (yeah)
That's probably why I dance with myself (you)

(chorus)
You're my star ( my shining' star)
It's such a wonder how you shine
So no matter how far
I'm dancing with you in my mind

Baby, we used to walk and talk (talk)
And you would hold my hand (hand)
And by the time we finished talkin'(talkin')
We were learnin' how to plan
And I can't wait till we move together

Again
Ah, baby
I want you so much
Its like you got the Midas touch

You're my star (you're my, shining star)
It's such a wonder how you shine
So no matter how far (oh, I'm dancing with you)
I'm dancing with you in my mind

You came to the home, to the water front castle
Hopped on my king-sized bed and we wrasled
Closet full of thousand dollar shoes with the tassel
You heard the chef, you know what he ask you
What you like to eat
Meanwhile Donatello on the other line askin' massage your feet
We laughed all day, nights we treasured
Damn, it's a shame that we couldn't stay together

We used to walk and talk (talk)
You would hold my hand (hand)
We were running kinda late
And I can't wait till we move together (again)
Mmm, again

You're my star (you're my, my, my, my)
It's such a wonder how you shine ( how you shine baby yeah, yeah, yeah)
No matter how far (dancing)
Dancing with you in my mind
