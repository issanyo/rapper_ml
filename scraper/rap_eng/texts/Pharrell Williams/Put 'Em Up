Are you a P-I-M-P?
But can't no nigga put the pimpin' like me

Get your set and put em up put em up (up)
Get your fingers put em up put em up (up)
Get your rag and put em up put em up (up)

Now it ain't N.O.R.E. to be on time
But I rock a rhyme that's right on slime, it's N.O.R.E
(It's N.O.R.E., N.O.R.E.) I'm just chillin' wit my shorty (shorty)
Drinkin' on a forty (forty), private stock old English (English)
Bout to get some naughty, O.P.P. no D-E-D
All she need is me up in the N-Y-C

[N.O.R.E.]
Now it ain't N.O.R.E. to be on time
But I rock a rhyme that's right on slime, it's N.O.R.E
(It's N.O.R.E., N.O.R.E.) Half mo, full mo
Wear a thong, g-code
Gettin' bent off that liquor
Till our colons thick and old
Stay trippin' on them hoes...we be illin'
And them whores doin' shows...top billin'
Stay packin' fo' fo's...ain't no concealin'
Peoples throwin' those bows....so how you feelin'

Now it ain't N.O.R.E. to be on time
But I rock a rhyme that's right on slime, it's N.O.R.E
(It's N.O.R.E., N.O.R.E.) Bangin' goin' crazy
Bangin' black Mercedes
Why I'm bangin' on them corners
Bangin' all your ladies
And she just wanna ride
Get up in that coupe and slide
Run around the corners lyin'
Say she Bonnie, said I'm Clyde (What?)
But I'm that type of guy
Have yo chicken bakin' pie
And she really wanna fuck me
I can see it in her eye
