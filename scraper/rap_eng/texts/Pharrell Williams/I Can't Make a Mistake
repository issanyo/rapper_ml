[Intro]

Hehah, yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah...come on

[Hook]

I can't make a mistake
Missing the dancefloor shake
I gotta get to the floor, I gotta get to the floor
(2x)

[MC Lyte]

Romancing in the dark, I spark the light
It's alright tonight, I gotta get the mic
As I scope the crowd, I spot red eyes
Grippin' them Heinekens, they don't know where they been
Baby got back see, rollin' like ten deep
But you look for good luck, swing in the Expo G
I mean no harm, but that lucky charm
You need to ditch it quick, get with the Brooklyn bomb
I be, we be, bumpin' the spot G
Wherever we be, we hit correctly
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on

[Hook]

[MC Lyte]

Come here, let's rap a taste a little
Floor's too high, not to jiggle in the middle of tender vittle
Cell phone, on roam, Syl Rhone, come home we double chrome
But I can't make a mistake, hmmm
Leave the dance floor now (uhn uhn, no no)
I'm on to somethin', he bubblin' the sugar baby
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, that ain't me baby
When I step into my Mizrahi frame
I change the game, it'll never look the same
Obstruct it, abstract it, my tactic, fantastic
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake, I can't make a mistake

[Hook]

[MC Lyte]

Yeah...here he come, lookin' like he 21
Knowing damn well, he too could get done
But he got a partner, and that ain't too hard to fix
Once I slide up in the mix
Juggin' it baby, from right to left
Jigged out, gotta pick ya out from what's left
It's no mystery, the way ya humpin' and bumpin'
I what you comin' home with me?
I'm-gon'-get-some-satisfaction
The way you comin' at me with the action
You betta know it, when ya dealing with the poet
Whatever ? you got, you betta show it
It's been so long, we gotta get it on
To this song, my song, now sing along come on
I can't make a mistake, I can't make a mistake

[Hook]
