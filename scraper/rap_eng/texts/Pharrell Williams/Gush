[Intro]
Gush
Make the pussy just gush
Make the pussy just gush
Make the pussy just gush
Make it, make it, just gush
Make it, just gush
I make the pussy just gush
I make it, just gush

[Verse 1]
I'm imagining things
Do you wanna try?
Take off your halo and wings
Girl, I can make her fly

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl (that would leave those panties in flame)
Light that ass on fire

[Chorus]
I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go

[Bridge]
Girl the world's watchin'
From sunset to moonrise
They're tryna catch a glimpse (intimacy)
Of you and I

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl (that would leave those panties in flame)
Light that ass on fire

[Chorus]
I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know, what's come over me
My momma didn't raise me that way
You lit a fire, from inside of me
That'd light your seat ablaze, girl (that would leave those panties in flame)
Light that ass on fire

[Chorus]
I could be the guy to treat you
To a nice movie, feed you
But I don't wanna mislead you
Tonight I think I wanna be dirty, girl
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Come on
Light that ass on fire
Do you wanna get dirty, girl? Let's go
