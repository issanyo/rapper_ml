[Intro/Interlude: female (Pharrell)]
If you want it, come get it (New York City must be)
If you want it, come get it
If you want it, come get it
If you want it, come get it (New York City must be)

[Hook: Pharrell]
Yeah, you can dance if you want to
But you really don't have to dance
See you got your eyes on the hustlers, you just wanna touch us
C'mon with the lump in your pants
See, I ain't gon' stress ya
But I know my glow got you under pressure
You already know that the flow is extra
Stand right here so the blocks can catch ya, listen

[Jadakiss]
C'mon, c'mon.. naw, uh-huh
You know, AH-HAH! Uh, yo
If you wan' take a picture with money then stand right here
You see all eyes is on the man right here
Us hookin up is the plan I swear
And you ain't gotta dance, you could stand right there
Nice hips plus she got an ass to lean on
Type of honey that you wanna flash the green on
Real New Yorker, brilliant author
The work still on the same scale as Orca
Still sellin the kush and lightin the sour
Still in the hood gettin right with the powder
So it ain't no need in fightin the power
Cause the flicks'll be up on every site in an hour, c'mon

[Hook]

[Jadakiss]
Uh-uh, uh-huh, know, AH-HAH!

Uh, yo - J to the MWAH
I'm one of the best in world ma, that's what they say on the blogs
Look in the garage, half of the cars
Off the bars, and the other half off the mall
My entourage is large, so hard
'Kiss run the streets, my niggas run the yard
Whoever disagree could bet they get scarred
We keep it so rugged but we still so suave
Just seen your girl, 'bout to give me a massage
Her friend wanna join, 'bout to make it a m√©nage
Let the desert off for the sake of the mirage
Cause it all look good, until the Louis lands far, yeah

[Hook]

[Interlude - repeat 2X]

[Jadakiss]
Uh-uh, uh-huh, you know, AH-HAH!
Uhh, yeah, yo - flow extra, dough extra
They recognize the glow no matter who he's next to
Recognized your ho, then he probably sexed her
All my hood niggas gettin money, throw your sets up
You know what it is with the kid, put your bets up
Honey wanna slide but I got her under pressure
Keep tryin to tell her that I ain't tryin to stress her
But come stand right here so the blocks can catch ya; let's go

[Hook]

[Outro: Pharrell]
