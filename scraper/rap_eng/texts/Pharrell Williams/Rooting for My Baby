[Verse 1]
When you wake in the morning
And I can tell it’s not your best side
No good morning, good day
I stay to the right if I know you’re mad
And on the left side, stay outta your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Verse 2]
If you were here, I’d get your beer and I would hang your coat
You wanna be home
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe
This is a long road, so much more to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Bridge]
See I’ve been dreamcatching
I thought that this is everlasting
A life filled with you, me, love, and laughter
Happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold on
In a minute, it’ll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
(I know, I know) That you go through a lot
(I know, I know) That the pressure makes you hot
(See, I know, I know) 'Cause you still know what you got
(I know, I know) Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, woo!) I’m rooting for my baby
(Woo, woo!) Yeah

[Outro]
I’m rooting for you, baby
Yeah
I’m rooting for my baby, yeah
That you go through a lot
The pressure makes you hot
You still know what you got, yeah
