[Verse 1]
Hold me
Show me all the talent God has given you
I want us thinking outside the box (all night long)
Just keep on going
You've done good things for me
Though I'm not an easy girl to please
I'll never run out of faith in you (all night long)
Just keep on going

[Chorus]
Long time, baby, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you

[Verse 2]
I wish I had longer legs
That I could fasten to your body
So you'd take me with you everywhere
And when you think I can take no more (All night long)
Just keep on going
If I let you have your way, don't think I'm weak
You got the stamina and the technique
So let those eloquent hands of yours (All night long)
Just keep on going

[Chorus]
Long time, baby, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you

[Bridge]
This thing we've got's so rare
It's so good it's not even fair
So how could anything compare to your way?
No way
How can you do me so much good?
I'm so happy I should get sued
But nothing matters next to you
No way, no way

[Chorus]
Long time, baby, long time
That's the way I've loved you, baby
Long night, it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya
Long time, baby, long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night, it's been a long night
I can't wait to touch you, touch you
