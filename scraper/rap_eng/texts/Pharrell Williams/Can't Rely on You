[Intro]
Hey, come on, get it
Come on with it
Help me

[Verse 1]
How will you gon' do love this way?
I work so hard for you everyday
While you're out, late night
Doing what you do
Chilling with who?
While I'm sitting at home
Come on with it!
(I don't know what this world is coming to)

[Chorus]
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)

[Verse 2]
Oh, Lord
How am I to ever explain?
I'm a melted awkward and right down the drain
'Cause if you don't want me (Release)
Repeat (Believe)
Want some (Want some)
Take me
He will take right out your way
Come on with it!
(I don't know what this world is coming to)

[Chorus]
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)

[Verse 3]
Time to go
Really
You can say what you want
But I'm out that door
Can't stop me
Oh, my man
Oh, Lord
(I don't know what this world is coming to)

[Chorus]
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
So I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)

[Bridge]
Just pulling in like it is
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Change your ways
You don't deserve it, babe
Look at here
'Cause that's why you drive me out of my mind

[Chorus]
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
I just can't rely on you (just can't rely on you)
Yeah, you got that good stuff but that don't last
Ain't good enough for me, baby
(Just can't rely on you)
