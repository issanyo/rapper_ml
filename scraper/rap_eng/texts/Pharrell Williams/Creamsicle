[Intro]
Hey girl
Can you turn down the bass some more?
It's still pounding
There we go

[Verse 1]
I just got your text message
That you want me to join you home
Well my reluctance would be less threatening
If you told me what you had on
So this what happen soon as I get home
Damn girl it feels good yeah right there
Can't you tell I'm serious by my tone
But I can't see your eyes move your hair
Is it possible for you to still moan
You know this is changing my life do you care
Do you believe that my mind's been blown
Oh shit I swear, that
I'm your guy, I'm your man to be
I can make anything happen all of a sudden
But, you're the girl, you're my fantasy
And when you kiss me there it pushes love's button
So

[Chorus]
It seems you've licked my creamsicle down
Thought it couldn't get no better no more
I jump on when you make that sound
In two minutes I'll get you one more

[Verse 2]
So perfect girl
Your pink cookies on top of those ICECREAM scoops
I want your nectar girl
You're so naked sweet
But now your peach should be dripping this juice

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious (it's just a record...)
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious (I ain't talkin' to no other girls what you talkin' 'bout it's just a record...)
I never get addicted 'less the headywap is serious

[Verse 3]
Baby, don't be lookin' at the speaker
You know that's not the way I treat ya
Never mind the song you're my girl
If you want me to you know I'll freak ya
You don't know how you know I'll teach ya
But not too dirty baby you're my girl
Shiiit...

[Chorus]
