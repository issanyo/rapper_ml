Ain't about the D-O-E then what you talkin for?
Expedition never slippin on a money mission
Shit is real when you ain't even got no pot to piss in
That's why I'm on the come up, for the come up
Watch you niggas get done up who try to run up
However, whatever the case may be

Meanwhile I'm a be scheming for dockets
Stash in the sock drawer, nice little duckie
Working on a master plan to get the master cash
Parties and shit I'm a have to pass
Cos one day I plan to live it up
Until then you gon give it up
Moneyman tell me what the fuck is up
Here we go, here we go, here we go again
Roll it up, light it up, pass it to a friend
Stacking it all whether it's twenty or a thousand
Out to take my Philly off of welfare out of public housing
Who me? I got bills to pay
Until then I'm gon make a way, is that okay?

Keep puffin until I'm high as a bird
Want the dough; fuck the crumbs, give em to the birds

Fuck being patient I ain't waiting for the outcomes
Fuck you eating ? please don't get me started
