Verse 1
Baby girl on fire
You know what she wants to do
Baby girl on fire
Sick of me waiting on you

I bet if you had the chance, wouldn't you...
Just sex just sex no romance, wouldn't you...
Everytime you wear those pants, wouldn't you...
The way you do that dance, wouldn't you...

Chorus
Yeah yeah yeah baby come on fuego
Yeah yeah yeah baby girl on fire
Yeah yeah yeah baby girl got a halo
But yeah yeah yeah baby come on higher

Yeah yeah yeah baby come on fuego
Yeah yeah yeah baby girl on fire
Yeah ok she might just lay low
But just know deep down she admires

Verse 2
Baby girl on fire
You know where she wanna be
Can you take her higher
Would it set her free

I bet if you had the chance, wouldn't you...
Just sex just sex no romance, wouldn't you...
If you could get away you'd use those hands, wouldn't you..
Well i figured out whats behind that glance, wouldn't you...

Chorus

Baby girl on fire
You know the way she wanna feel
Baby I'm her lighter
Cos I'm going to make her squeal

I bet if you had the chance, wouldn't you...
Just sex just sex no romance, wouldn't you...
Keep telling yourself who I can't, wouldn't you...
On your breath you moan and pant

Chorus
