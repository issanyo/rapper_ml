[Verse 1: Common]
Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with a attitude
Pass the booze and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no bo but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom, stepping to the A.M
Cats is toting in the BM, tell them players I'm the G.M
Told my team let me get my plays straight and I'mma feed them
They need me like I need them, see the streets is bleeding
Had a meeting with my mind on how I can be divine and
Stay on my grind, I'm grinding until I get blue balls
Every day same shit new stall
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal
It's a place that you run from if you neutral
Hustlers in Volks, customers and smoke
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

[Hook: Pharrell]
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high
(I got the right to feel high) I got the right to feel high

[Verse 2: Common]
I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go to a thrift shop
Bring that get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gon' get that kick-a-box make sure that bitch knock
If you gon' get that Glock don't be scared to lick shot
Hip Hop is changing, y'all want me to stay the same?
Sort of like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that, messing with no other man's woman
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell with the fan in the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands
I want a Rover but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over I just made my own lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
Like a pimp to a ho I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to The Light
I'm trying to do better, I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, too old to fist-fight
Stay on point like trick dice
You tweaking like a sound man you need to switch mics
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot but we just can't get ice
Want our children's children to sit nice
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees
I'm vegan but I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey bar damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through Chi-Town so feel the breeze yo

[Hook]
