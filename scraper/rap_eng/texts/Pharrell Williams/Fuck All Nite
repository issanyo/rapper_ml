[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury
Now you be, comin' home while I'm wakin' up (yeah!)
Actin' like you behave and stuff
Uh-huh, you should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury, now check it

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Pharrell Williams)]
Yes, a lime to a lemon, my V-A women
Walk in Manolo Blahniks 'cause my condo with elevators in 'em
She wanna wrinkle my linens
So I sprinkle her with gin and then we begin sinnin', uhh
Blasphemy, oh my God, every sentence
She keeps scratchin' me like she have tiger in her
This is exact-a-ly, why I had to pin her
To the bed like a wres-tl-er, had to pretzel her, uhh
Her man kept pagin', stressin' her
So I told her what to say just in case he question her
(Situations will arise, but you gotta be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Don't give him no info, he'll be lost without it
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury
Now you be, comin' home while I'm wakin' up (yeah!)
Actin' like you behave and stuff
Uh-huh, you should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury, now check it

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Guess who's back in my motherfuckin' house
Half black, half white chick; I call her Minnie Mouse (wooo!)
We always hook up when we out
We do what we like to do and then we out
But lately I've been havin' the strangest feelings
Your boy Young Hov' catchin' feelings
And it's messin' up my dealings 'cause mami's not willin'
To leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend
Said, we was just 'sposed to hook up and have a blast
She called me her emergency dick-in-a-glass
Hehehe, I had to laugh for a second
Had to check myself, get my mackin' back in perspective
I slack for a second but I'm back, no question
Like I walk with a cane, Ain't No Half-Steppin'
Jeah, and on that note
Iceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury
Now you be, comin' home while I'm wakin' up (yeah!)
Actin' like you behave and stuff
Uh-huh, you should be comin' home with me
Sittin' in this lap with the luxury, now check it

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Jay-Z]
Let's just - fuck all night! Yeah
Until we both start yawnin'
Yeah
To the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Yeah
Until we both start yawnin'
Let's just - fuck all night! Yeah
Let's have breakfast baby
Yeah
Have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast baby
Yeah
Let's have breakfast baby
Have lunch, have dinner, back to breakfast maybe

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
This is - if that kid don't get too suspicious
Stop blowin' up your digits
Showin' up livid, claimin' he wanna fight
But Shawn all business with his type (uh-uh), nah!
Shawn just tryna keep the friendship tight
Shawn to Sean Paul 'em if you Gimme the Light
And this way you can stay for life, aight?

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You used to all the attention, huh? (Yeah!)
But you don't want no commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
