Miss Little Havana
17 with a body just like a model
I heard that she was in that superstar cabana
Dancin' as if she just hit the lotto
But that will amount to ze ze ze zero
It is just the same scenario
Mom's at work
And daddy's never home
Idle hands lookin' for time to blow
And get some freedom
She ain't payin' attention
Her mind's in the air
Life is so hard
And no one cares
There ain't no angels to whisk you away
So wisen up ok

[?]
She's beginning her life on her own
Brand new place but
She don't have a phone
Matter of fact the only thing
She owns
Is her freedom
She ain't payin' attention
Her mind's in the air
Life is so hard
And no one cares
There ain't no angels to whisk you away
So wisen up ok
Miss Little Havana
17 with a body just like a model
I heard that she was in that superstar cabana
Dancin' as if she just hit the lotto
But that will amount to ze ze ze zero
If he says it's a secret
C'mon let's fly away
Girl, don't believe it
Those guys tell lies all day
He'll never keep it
He will tell everything
Everyone will know
Uh-oh no lotto
Open up your eyes
Abre los ojos
Open up your eyes
