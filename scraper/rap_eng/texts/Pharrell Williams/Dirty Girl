[Intro]
Yeah I see her

[Verse 1]
I'm a clean girl
And I ain't try'na glory 'bout myself
But I ain't try'na loose to someone else
Loneliness I already felt
Cause of some dirty girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, so flirty
Ooh, ooh, ooh, huggin every thug
Ooh, ooh, ohh, watch her shake it up
Ooh, ooh, ohh, she's so dirty

[Chorus]
Bitch u know da chica ova there (Yea I seen her look)
I know u know da chica ova there
That's alright wit me
She ain't got nothin' ova me
And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothin'fo free
Dirty girl please
Try'na ride
But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially when she's a dirty girl
Dirty girl, dirty girl

[Verse 2]
I'm a clean girl
Not tryin to say
That I don't do these things
For all these things
There is a time and place
What's the challenge
If there is no chase
Answer...A dirty girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh so dirty
Ooh, ooh, ooh see her in the club
Ooh, ooh, ooh how you lick it up
She so dirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
So flirty, ooh, ooh, ooh
Huggin every thug,ooh,ooh,ooh
Watch her shake it up
She so dirty

[Chorus]
Bitch u know da chica ova there (Yea I seen her look)
I know u know da chica ova there
That's alright wit me
She ain't got nothin' ova me
And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothin fo free
Dirty girl please
Try'na ride
But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially since she's a dirty girl
Dirty girl, dirty girl

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh (now you kno what I'm talkin bout)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (uh uh uh uh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (uh uh uh uh she's so dirty)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (she's so dirty)

[Chorus]

And I know she ain't got the keys
But she don't do nothin fo free
Dirty girl please

But I'm already inside
And she can't come crush my world
Especially since she's a dirty girl
Dirty girl, dirty girl

[Pre-Chorus]
