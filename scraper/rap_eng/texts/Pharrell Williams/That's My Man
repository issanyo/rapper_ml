[Intro: LIZ]
I am not worried, he'll come
Just like he always does
Yeah
Yeah, that's my man

[Verse 1: LIZ (Pharrell)]
Countdown, here we go
Turn this up on your radio
Blast off, coast to coast
Where we're going, baby, we don't know
Freak, freak, free to be
Anything that I wanna be
(If we wanna) party, (if we're gonna) party
Like it's the end of the week (come on)

[Pre-Chorus: LIZ]
He is like my watch
He's always on time
We might not have much
But I know he's mine
We love where we're from
It's like we're stuck in time
A cold world melts with love
I'm electrified

[Chorus 1 x2: LIZ]
And they say boys get to have all the fun
The cops and robbers stay on the run
Saving your girl, it's a task so kick his ass
That's my man

[Verse 2: LIZ]
Hello world, it's your girl
You're talking to a Harlem girl
Where I'm from, they are often
Swinging
Don't get me wrong, there's also love
Like my boyfriend from above
The way he loves me, that just leaves me
Singing

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And they say boys get to have all the fun
The hero's job is never done
Saving your girl before yourself, caught in your web
That's my man, yeah

[Bridge: LIZ]
Many boys have made me out of breath
But yours didn't go away
And I suppose I figured out how
He pulls me out, he's an angel

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
