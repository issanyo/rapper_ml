[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I want you
Do you want me too?
I have one question
Can I help you?
Now watch me, what I do
Now thank you for coming through my drive-thru
Oh!

[Verse 2: Julian Casablancas]
When you're haunted by the demons that'll never let you rest
Not shy in front of crowds, but shy in front of just one guest
Not dumb enough to win at their game
But not smart enough to dumb it down, and take it away
It's black & white like space at night
If you wanna be like us you better work every night

[Verse 3: Santogold]
One question, what's your impression?
Now, with a walk like mine, I'm a big presence
So make your move real slow my mind's a weapon
I said just move in slow no second guessing
I find your approach so adolescent
I may look young but your game is prepubescent
So watch my feet I'm known for my quick steppin'
You wanna keep up gotta show me somethin'

[Refrain: Pharrell Willams]
Oh!

[Verse 4: Julian Casablancas]
Look at all the leaders
Hanging in the playground
Always beating up the weaker ones
(I'm going after you)
The answer to the question
That I don't understand
Is a word that I have never heard
(I'm going after you)
You think happiness is watching TV all night long?
You dig the job of dealing, you're the people in this song
Well I am here to change your goal
I regret everything I've done

[Verse 5: Santogold]
You wonder oh, how do I inspire?
Got the world spinnin' 'round inside my palm
Don't hate me, you know they got you wired
You better short circuit, be your own program
Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance
Dance, we wanna dance, just wanna dance (2x)

[Bridge: Julian Casablancas]
It's summer, in the city
I'ts summer, in the city
I want so bad to dance with you
Don't waste your time with one or two
The time is right, the summer night
You fall in love at every light

[Verse 6: Santogold]
You wonder who do I inspire
Got the world spinnin' 'round inside my palm
Don't hate me, you know they got you wired
You better short circuit, be your own program
Cause we all wanna dance, just wanna dance
Dance, we wanna dance, just wanna dance (2x)
