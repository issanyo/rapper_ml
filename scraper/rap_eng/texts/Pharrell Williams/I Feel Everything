Your stare makes me freeze but I can't stay still
Those eyes keep me up longer than any other pill
And I know, being together
We feel like forever
And now, more than ever I feel everything (feeling everything)

You make me feel so crazy, I've never felt so sane
Beaten up by love but the feelings still remain
You should know, if you want it, it's yours
So come and get it
Right now, more than ever I feel everything (feeling everything)

All I got (I'm yours)
I'll give it to you (be mine)
You're in my brain (I'm yours)
And my heart too (be mine)
Because I am yours
If you want me too
Tell me you want me too
'cos I'll give it all to you

I'm scared that I'm falling
Come catch me, I'm falling
My heart is calling
Can't stop me roaring, I'm soaring, I'm sky high
I'm scared that I'm falling
I'm blind and I'm falling
My love is calling
You can't stop me roaring, I'm soaring
Come jump with me and fly

Never thought I'd fall like this
I've jumped right into this eternal bliss
And I know being together we feel like forever
And now, more than ever I feel everything (feeling everything)

All I got (I'm yours)
I'll give it to you (be mine)
You're in my brain (I'm yours)
And my heart too (be mine)
Because I am yours
If you want me too
Tell me you want me too
'cuz I'll give it all to you

I'm scared that I'm falling

(Feeling everything)
