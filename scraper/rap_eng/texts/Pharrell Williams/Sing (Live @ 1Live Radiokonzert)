It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x

SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo

This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the
Stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but
Something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I roll with the chain
Singing we found love in a local rave
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can
Just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya then she
Handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know it she's a keeper
Just from this once small act of kindness I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out I am meant to drive home but i
Took all of it now I'm not sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she's
Kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance...
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from above
Can you feel it?
Found you hot in here so I hope you'll take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again

Can you feel it? Oooohooohooo wappaaa
Can you feel it? Oooohhoooo no no no

SING!

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!

If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rush undo you from your head to toe

Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x

SING!
