Now you know you got them women that are sexy
And you got those women that, you know, they're freaky
Got those women that are pretty
Some that are fine
And when you put all that together
That's when you got you a bad girl
Bad girl, mala mala, si no te veo hoy yo te veo mañana (¿cómo?)
Bad girl, mala mala, coje los hombres y lo deja cambiada (dale)
Bad girl, hola hola, si no te cojo hoy yo te cojo mañana (¿cómo?)
Sana sana, culito de ganas sino sana hoy se te sana mañana

Go ahead and work that ass girl

Do the , in it, and bang, bang , in it
Sexy, classy, freaky, nasty, sassy

She's fine plus fine, she's bad, damn

Love, lust, equals us
Like Barack, bring some hope to this bad world
Go ahead you bad girl

Bad girls in the house, ay mi madre, dancing
And this chico right here is dangerous
Mami like Wall Street, looking for 
No treat, I skeet, then I ...
Not this one, she bad as hell
Mami , ain't hard to tell
So I chill with her, get it real with her
Next thing you know, I was cutting deals with her
I-N-D-P-E-aaah
Don't mind me, independent, spending
Moves so great I might bend them
Rule as I end them
She the Queen with no England
Now mami, what you into
If you got an open mind, go ahead and bring your kin, too
Like Barack, bring some hope to this bad world
Go ahead you bad girl

Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go
Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go
Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go
Calling all the bad girls, aaoeaa, give it to me, let's go
I don't know if it's a basic instinct
I don't know if it's a fatal attraction
But I like to hit 'em in threes, like taxing
I want another 48 hours of action (bad girl)
I'm gon' ride with her (bad girl)
And that's for sure (bad girl)
That's cause I tried it once (bad girl)
And now I want some more (bad girl)
