[Verse 1]

I know I disappeared

And popped up in Pérès making chairs with a beard

And those that love me probably thought that it was weird

While the haters was happy

They thought my destiny was cleared

And any artist that you love have veered

Especially when they hated the image that they mirrored



I got a text that said P please get up

So like tron im brightly outlining my shit up

The penthouses, the homes, the cars, the chains

The stones

The admirers, mini me's, and clones

Selling you niggas dreams that are boxes full of foam



In and out of dimensions I walk through walls

Just sayin' you can't put me in a box thas all

No Da Vinci codes or Twilight stubs

Dont take this wrong but I like the taste of blood



Yo



[Verse 2]

So fittin, the sound in my system

Makes me wanna squish them

King kong foot

The beast has awakened

The protools tapin'

My position blatant

You knew I was coming

Trace this you waitin'

Now look up and ask why you've been forsaten



I shall hover

With splendid colors

That alone makes me other

Plus the, return of the jedi

I study how the brooklyn machine works

Thats word to big and his dead eye

I rise to the top like the sun

I rise to the pocket like a gun

I fire drop your body and its done



They like what happened?

We trapped them

Hatred is obliterated when I imagine

Look at you drowning in your lungs, gaspin'

Blood on the dancefloor, he, he Michael Jackson

Bitches should stay home, they do some much comin'

Y'all should stand back cause you do so much frontin'

Take this sunblock you got too much sunnin'

Now lets examine what you thinkin', running

Run too hard you might tear your meniscus

And if you try to run up, youll only get your wig split

This campaign we runnin is vicious

I hate to eat and run but this was delicious
