[Verse 1: Lalah Hathaway]
When I first got here, had to find my way
But the end of the days were dark
When I was not clear, you showed me my mistakes
But told me keep the pace, don't get lost
So I shall not fear, yeah
That's how it feels when you love me
And you're my sightseer
'Cause before I'm in a rut
You multiply by 10 times what they took from me

[Pre-Chorus:]
You send out a branch from the longest tree
When I'm in quicksand
But in my mind it's really your arm to me
Can't believe it, what a lifting

[Chorus:]
Hard to believe (Surrender!)
But there's a difference (Surrender!)
I surrender (Surrender!)
'Cause I understand
For me (Surrender!)
There's no coincidence
Just confirmation
Let me see them hands

Do you remember I questioned how I feel
I asked you were you real at all
And when you entered, you found the biggest wall
Said "Is that all?" Made it fall
With your wonder, it blows my mind how you love me
So it's no wonder, I feel how I feel
I can't thank you enough for what you did for me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I was down on myself, and I called you
And your answer is "What can I do?"
So much you do for me
In the sound of my breath seen all the years of surrender
Just know I'm here reporting for duty

[Vamp:]
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go
Don't ever let go, oh
Don't ever let go, oh
When it feel this good
Don't ever let go, go
Don't ever let go, oh
Don't ever let go, oh

[Chorus: Lalah & Pharrell]

Please, just wave
Wave, wave
In this place
Wave, wave
Wave your hands
Wave, wave
