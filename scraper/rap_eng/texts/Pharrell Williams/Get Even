You know
I saw it coming
I watched her watch me
The girl wanted what I had
Isn't that the story?
I'm not mad
I'm not mad

She spent so much time
Pursuin' you knowing that you were blind
And that's a bummer babe
It left me under babe
And it's true
Her tits were blinding you
While I had a hard enough time finding you
And thats a bummer babe
But I still love you baby

(get even)
Don't you hate when you lose your man to a chick
(even)
And she does it in your face to make sure you feel it
(get even)
So the story draws out like some long ass skit
(even)
And bitch you knew that I like him get even

She wants to change her mind
And make sure you don't ever end up mine
And that's a bummer babe
She's so annoying babe (God)
But over my dead body
Will you not see that the grass is sure enough more green
And that's a bummer babe
Don't you ever wonder babe?

This is no new phenomenon
This always has been going on
When some punk bitch just does you wrong
And she keeps going on and on
This is no new phenomenon
This has been going on and on
When a relationship is going wrong and you just want to fucking get even

I'm a survivor
I'm getting older and wiser
I'm gonna live now
And nothing can change my mind
I'm a survivor
I'm getting older and wiser
And nothing can change my mind
I'm gonna live now

(get even)
Don't you hate when you lose your man to a chick
(even)
And she does it in your face to make sure you feel licked
(get even)
Some story draws out like some long ass skit
(even)
And bitch you knew that I liked to get even

(get even)
Don't you hate when you lose your man to a chick
(even)
And she does it in your face to make sure you feel licked
(get even)
Some story draws out like some long ass skit
(even)
And bitch you knew that I liked to get even

I'm a survivor
I'm getting older and wiser
I'm gonna live now
And nothing can change my mind
I'm a survivor
I'm getting older and wiser
And nothing can change my mind
I'm gonna live now

(get even)
Don't you hate when you lose your man to a chick
(even)
And she does it in your face to make sure you feel licked
(get even)
Some story draws out like some long ass skit
(even)
And bitch you knew that I liked to get even
