[Intro]
Alls my life I have to bring, content
Alls my life I...
Long streams like, "God!"
Bad leaks like, "Yeah!"
Saysera, I fucked up
Homie, I fucked up
But if chat got us, then we gon' make content

[Hook]
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize y'all be waitin for the streams bruh
But Pokimane be looking at me from the waist down
I'm so wavy, I'm so wavy that you might drown
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my plans
Only care bout makin content for my fans
Where pretty Poki and Lily is just a highlight
Now tell Saysera I love him, but this what I like, Twitch knows
Thousands of em in my stream, tell 'em all to join the team
I been living out my dreams, so you know that I'm pristine
I don't even want them haters in my chat
I'm Hoecage around here better show me some respect
Tell the chat I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I just leaked
Saysera delete VODs all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been banned before
When our pride was low
Lookin' at my stream like, "Where do we go?"
And we hate on Joast
Wanna get us banned from the site fo sho'
I'm at Saysera's door
My eyes gettin' weak, and my shit gets leaked
But we gon' make content

[Hook]
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content

[Verse 2]
Which are you: you a sub, you a pleb?
Joast fan? Foki fan? Homie this life or death
Anyways we don't fuck with Temmie, That's a rat
Motherfucker, you cannot dispute the facts
I can see the spear , I don't care, Lily I don't fear
I don't think about her, kick it up to another gear
Thinking bout my options, taking caution, I don't wanna leak you
You've been talking trash, FeelsBad imma have to seek you
I'm a pro streamer, back away I don't even need you
They can't mess with Federico... Ah!
I don't stream on time, but it's fine, It's lit when I get to
If I'm streamin then you know I'm leaking, Lily, I can beat you
Pet rat, pet rat, pet rat, her rat, that's all
Sit back, watch chat, Make content for y'all
I rap, I spaz on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with Twitch

[Pre-Hook]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been banned before
When our pride was low
Lookin' at my stream like, "Where do we go?"
And we hate on Joast
Wanna get us banned from the site fo sho'
I'm at Saysera's door
My eyes gettin' weak, and my shit gets leaked
But we gon' make content

[Hook]
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
We gon' make content
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' make content

[Outro]
I keep my chat up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Poki and me is complicated
You gon see that I'm the greatest
You're alright but I'm the favorite
Twitch chat's in my prayers
