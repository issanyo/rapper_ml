Fuck what a hater think about me
If I like it Ima put it on a album
Tryin to get this income and honestly
I could give a fuck about the outcome
Okay
Just lookin for a reason to keep rappin
And finally I found one
Okay
They just tryin to knock you down
You would be a fool if you allowed em
Huh
M.A. pick ya crown up
Huh
Last minute in the fourth quarter
I was down one
Then I hit that fade away jumper
Shut the crowd up
Feeling like Tyson knockin niggas
Out in round one
Fuck being number two Im coming
For that pound one
I need a bad bitch and a down one
Bcuz fuckin with them hoes gettin old
I'd rather come home my own buy a stove
Ain’t nothing like pussy when you
Coming off the road yeah
Ima eat that pussy to the bone
Young M.A. you nasty
Shut up bitch I'm grown
Only goin platinum
Gold ain't a goal
Tunnel vision and I feel like I’m looking through a cone and the streets still rockin with me
Pocket rocket got it with me GGGGDT
All that tough shit don't you try it with me
Keep a lion with me just in case
Make a motor mouth nigga hit the bricks GGGGDT
Wrist dripping like I dipped it in a lake
I don't care if bitches curve me because my tickets straight
Sipping Ace lobster on my dinner plate
Eating great make ya bitch feed me grapes
She got a even face with the Serena cake
Close the curtains on a hater let em see the drapes
I keep my money a mystery because I don't know who a friend or a enemy
Never let me see what you make Facts
Niggas told me to get em so Ima get em
We ain't dripping in sauce we dripping in venom
Got snakes on the denim feeling that toxin
I got a brick in my pocket because I don't carry a wallet
Promote money stop promoting that violence
That's word to jmes harden we still holding them rockets Huh
I don't wanna be the plug man call me the opposite because what’s really the plug without the socket
My money loud yours all moment of silence Shhh
Everything quiet everything silent the problem is you broke niggas don’t know how to be honest when I was broke said I was broke but I got up and grinded
Im a cheap mf though but I love it though
I get the money and I hold it for hostage
Got that biggie album let that bitch sleep in the closet if I wake her up best believe she screaming and hollering
Stay your ass off my property I live in the mountains I let your bitch see the horizon
Last night she let me poca like hontus
Thought the bitch was puerto rican found out she was scottish we live in two different worlds we have nothing in common long as she know to open up and let me put it inside her
White car brown seats look
Like a henny-colada make the Audi mad black license plate say wakanda my bitch say she mad at me I just bought her designer 30 inch brazilian now she think she Chewbacca
I'm cool kinda but I’m standing in fire like who's hotter I'm one in a million like blue lobster
Man swag sick my drip
Come with a few doctors
Yo lifeguard just so I won't drown in my drip
32k on my wrist boo bound with a bitch
You in pictures with your gang let’s take clowns with a pic bozos
Wanna be gangsta for other niggas
That's why none of these bitches is fucking with you
Stupid stupid
Y'all niggas out here trying to flex for other niggas
