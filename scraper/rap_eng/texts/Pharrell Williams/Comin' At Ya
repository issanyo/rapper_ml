[Verse 1: Noreaga]
We, we stay performin' for the [?] and gettin' it on
No pyro, no dances just the stage is storm
If you don't see us on the tube, then you watchin' it wrong
We dem niggas with dem baggy jeans, hoes in the thong
Stay lightin', lightin', fightin', fightin'
Fans gotta love it, 'cause the crowd still reciting - No!
You think they ready to go? - No!
See, it don't matter, I still gleaming and glow
I see a N.O.R.E. bang bitches from barbeques to Bar Mizwas
Big ass, hips, lick her lips, suck
I saw many Yay, I smoked plenty Hay
Cuttin' niggas off, I ain't like dem niggas anyway
Sloppy and cocky and sound all wack
And it's a ten to one chance that you might get slapped
And you can see me in a Hummer like "La-la-la Bomba"
You can check me if I'm holdin', you can see if ya wonda

[Verse 2: Capone]
Ey, yo, I'm in that game heavy, dog watch and I front
I'm two-sided, look good plus I'm ill with the pump
I got murder in my eyes, dog, I dare you to [?]
So much money in my pants pocket, call me the [?]
Ask about me anybody, move wrong and I bury 'em
Left the beef alone now, I'm a full vegetarian
Fresh of a Jetlag, lettin' my pants sass
Right up my best bag and hop in a ret jet (skate, skate)
Y'all gone remember me fresh out the penitentiary poppin'
You know what's elementary
That I'm droppin' the bullets burn like hell - I thought ya know
In the hood they call me "Young [Cokelopino?]" low in da cut, what?
[?] yep, yo boys don't look too tuff
I have hammers for years, bandanas and beards
I'm a man of my word
Give my brother one of my rips, just live

Catch me swervin' in a burbin', unconvertable black
