[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
1, 2, 3, 4
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to go
I know who I am as soon as I step out the door
Most my neighbors in my neighborhood already know
Oh, isn't that Benevolent?
Whoa, He's fresher than a peppermint
Yo, yesterday I let him spit
No joke, man that boy is hella sick
I don't think I'll ever get played out or raggedy
People that get mad at me, are people trying to battle me
They be nervous or sweating when they be rapping after me
I'd give up the rap game before I burn a calorie
Actually I'm just bringing hip-hop back
And I'm keeping it fresh like a twist off cap
So they label me fresh cause I did all that
I'm fresh I was born in a ziploc bag, man

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
Kit fresh? Yes
Dough low? No
Spits nice? Yes
Kicks cold? Fo sho'
Game cold? Fo sho'
Ladies see me? Yes
Never nothing less lil' homie
Just call me Mr. Fresh
Call me Mr. Fresh
Call me Mr. Fresh

[Verse 2: Benny Boy]
Salutations, My real name is Abel dog
I got you hooked on the track like cable car
I'm amazing y'all, cause the way I start to saying
The rhymes make haters want to start the hating
Then they want to battle me, start confrontation
I light up anybody when I'm on and blazing
That's what I mean when I spark a conversation
That usually leads into an altercation
I'm not Jamaican, but I can be a rude boy
Growing up with my moms, only had two toys
One was the microphone, the other was the toy chest
Couldn't use the chest, but the mic made me so fresh
Clothes best kept at seventy-two fahrenheit
Beat's like how girls wear pants, very tight
When I kill a bunch of tracks, then I got to bury mics
Fat rhymes, fat beats, call the track Barry White

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
Kit fresh? Yes
Dough low? No
Spits nice? Yes
Kicks cold? Fo sho'
Game cold? Fo sho'
Ladies see me? Yes
Never nothing less lil' homie
Just call me Mr. Fresh
Call me Mr. Fresh
Call me Mr. Fresh

[Verse 3: Benny Boy]
Whatever you think you can do, I can too
The only difference is that I can do it all brand new
And with that in mind, dog I can't lose
I'm fresh off of the top of the head like shampoo
Y'all will get ran through, I don't even try
You supposed to beat me, and you quoting my lines
You supposed to be fresh, and supposed to be fly
Cause you spit bars? I spit bars of soap in your eyes
So you know that I'm burning ya
And I'm laid back like reclined furniture
Battling me lil' boy? I'll murder ya
And the flow is murder, so I call attorney's up
And they know it's me so they never taking the case
Not Fort Minor, but y'all going to remember the name
Abel, but my rap name fits me best
Benevolent a.k.a. Mr. Fresh

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
Kit fresh? Yes
Dough low? No
Spits nice? Yes
Kicks cold? Fo sho'
Game cold? Fo sho'
Ladies see me? Yes
Never nothing less lil' homie
Just call me Mr. Fresh
