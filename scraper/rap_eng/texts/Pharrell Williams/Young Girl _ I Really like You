You know, you know listen to me
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
That's true, so true, you're the only girl I love to
But my heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
So true, so true, listen
I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiles she brought me home
So I brought her home
It's not that the feelin' of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin' 'round
So why you lookin' down
What you lookin' down for?
I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say
As the People Magazine and crushes hurt both ways
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
Hove got a young girl
Hove got a young girl, still not quite 21
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi miss thing"
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows, screams of horror
Classic Steven King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone
So advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, hove don't fight
Hopin' threw it I might mo your life
'Cause I'ma show you right
Proper etiquette and how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Opras ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(Young girl)
Mama help, I fell in love with a young girl
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
Young girl, so in love with you
('Cause I'm never too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
('Cause I'm never too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, I'm never to young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
('Cause I'm never too young)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
This is where the story begins baby
There were flashing lights when we met
Not the typical place you would be
In a flash of time my mind was set
I knew you were the girl there for me
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F U T U R E, spells the future girl
Sit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Against the wall is where you lean
The most beautiful girl that I've seen
Out of this world, my God, you bling
I'm surprised that you are a human being
And though you just wanted to leave
Imagine how great it could be
The F U T U R E, spells the future girl
Sit down hold your horses don't leave, where you going girl?
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Come and sit with me, don't be so quick to leave
I really like you girl
Let's trade thoughts and words, explore the universe
But just don't leave me girl
I really like you girl, girl
From the moment that we met
I really like you girl, oh, girl
I know it Susan
Yo, I think I got the one now
Never me man, never me, never in a million years
But I do
