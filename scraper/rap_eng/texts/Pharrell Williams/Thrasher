[Intro]
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Every once in a while there is some asshole
Giving you shit, cause something in his life won't fold
Usually, I'd walk away
The "peace/piece" offering another day
He seems not to wanna trade
So he must pay (its the inevitable, it's going down!)

[Bridge - Pharrell]
He's talking! (fuck him up!) at me (fuck him up!)
Instead of! (fuck him up!) to me (fuck him up!)
My intellegence! (fuck him up!) sacked me (fuck him up!)
But he say's! (fuck him up!) he'll run through me (fuck him up!)

[Hook - Pharrell]
(THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) you ain't know (THRASHER!)
That I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!)
I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a (THRASHER!) I'm a..

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
Every once in a while there's that same asshole
Try to swing and hit, cause the things he can't control
And God knows what will unfurl
Either with or without his girl
Cause I browsed down, his fingers curled
Like it's his world (its the inevitable, it's going down!)

[Bridge]

[Hook] (w/ minor variations)

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
Now I know that slime ballers laying out and all
But he said things that were so uncalled for
But he deserved it (the boy deserved it)
And I know your his girl but you should ride wit me
Cause I'll show you feelings that you've never seen
Keep this rocking it's brown mixed with green (we'll be swervin)

[Outro]
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!
HO! HO! HO! HO!
