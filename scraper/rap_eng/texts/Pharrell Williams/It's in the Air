[Congressman Patrick Kennedy]
If anybody wants to know where cynicism is, cynicism is that there's one, two, press people in this gallery. We're talking about Eric Massa 24/7 on the TV, we're talking about war and peace, three billion dollars, a thousand lives and no press?! No press?! You wanna know why the American public is fit, they're fit because they're not seeing their congress do the work that they're said to do. It's because the press, the press of the United States is not covering the most significant issue of national importance, and that's a laying of lives down in the nation, for the service of our country. It's despicable, the national press core right now

[Pharrell]
Mmm Dada, I'm sure you can tell
It's in the air, of our nation
It may shock ya, the maddest hallucination
But the dead people, they'll be dressed well (yeah)
They say

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm ahead, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Hook]
And now it's in the air, spreading everywhere
So you should be prepared
(Ain't no pill or cough syrup)
(That can help so you better hurr'up)
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on
Hey, hey, hey
It's in the air
Hey, hey, hey

[Pharrell]
To spread this thing, they don't need a tongue
Instead they use the precious lungs
But the scariest thing, they don't {?} kill ya
But they're still dead people dancin' like Thriller

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm ahead, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!

[Hook]

[Pharrell]
They comin in, they get me now
What a shitstorm of the situation
But a maid and I, guns to the biggest cloud
Stop big brother and there's invasion (yeah) come on

[Shay Haley]
What's yo' name? You the one starin
Oh my God, lemme shake yo' hand
Do it like this, do it like that
Can you switch it up? Send it right back
Frown to your back, smile to your face
Think I keep it real, but I keep it fake
Think I'm the head, but I'm the ass
Man I'm really sick, I really need a mask
Woof!
