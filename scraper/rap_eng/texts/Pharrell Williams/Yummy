[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (You see me)
Ain't got no patience, so let's go (You see me)
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes
(You see me)

[Verse 1: Gwen Stefani]
Walk in the place, they know my face
Encore, sophomore
Only one solo, I swore
Big mouth, applause
Oh please, one more
Wanna hear it before I say "naw"
Let me check my itinerary, umm... alright
Presto, skintight
Escaped, and I risked my life
For what, so I could watch them bite?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Gwen Stefani]
Only one Gwen you can find like this
I mean blows your mind like this
Your key won't shine like this
If it's yours, then you know it won't wind like this
(Wind it up!)

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (You see me)
Ain't got no patience, so let's go (You see me)
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes
(You see me)

[Post-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I know you've been waiting, but I've been off making babies
And like a chef making donuts and pastries
(It's time to make you sweat)
Sex and sugar is the flavor, ovens and beaters and graters
Beats made of bongos and shakers
(It's time to make you sweat)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Walk in the place, they know my face
Billionaire boys, ice cream drippin' 'cross the floor
Big house, garage
Bentleys, Ferrar
Wanna go before I say "naw"
Let me check my itinerary, umm... alright
G4, G flight
Bed in the back so I have a G night
Good night
Hood, right?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
Ain't no nigga you can find like this
I mean, blow your mind like this
Nigga watch don't shine like this
If it's ticking, then it don't tell time like this

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (You see me)
Ain't got no patience, so let's go (You see me)
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes
(You see me)

[Post-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I know you've been waiting, but I've been off making babies
And like a chef making donuts and pastries
(It's time to make you sweat)
Sex and sugar is the flavor, ovens and beaters and graters
Beats made of bongos and shakers
(It's time to make you sweat)

[Bridge: Gwen Stefani & (Pharrell Williams)]
Now sweat, baby
Get stupid, jump up, go crazy
L.A.M.B. in 3D, worldwide across your TV
P, you crazy, how'd you get this?
This sounds like Disco Tetris
Do I have time to connect this?
Let me check my itinerary, umm...
I came back for my spotlight (For her spotlight)
I disappeared like Houdini (Where Houdini?)
If yours didn't come out right (If it's not right)
Go to Kinko's and xerox me

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (You see me)
Ain't got no patience, so let's go (You see me)
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes
(You see me)
I'm feeling yummy head to toe (You see me)
Ain't got no patience, so let's go (You see me)
Look, I'm diet drama
Wanna spend the night? Don't bring pajamas
Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes
(You see me)

[Post-Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I know you've been waiting, but I've been off making babies
And like a chef making donuts and pastries
(It's time to make you sweat)
Sex and sugar is the flavor, ovens and beaters and graters
Beats made of bongos and shakers
(It's time to make you sweat)
