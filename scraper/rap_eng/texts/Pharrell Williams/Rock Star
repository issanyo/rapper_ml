[Intro]
Fuckin' posers
Yo yo, yeah
Yo yo, yeah
Yo yo, yeah
Yo yo, yeah
It's almost over now
Almost over now
Yeah
It's almost over now
Almost over now

[Verse 1]
You think the way you live is okay
You think posin'
Will save the day
You think we don't see
That you're running
Better call your boys
Cause I'm coming

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
Yes, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 2]
You had plenty of time
There was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait
I'm standing there

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
Yes, you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

[Verse 3]
You don't succeed cause you hesitate
You think we're fly
But we levitate
Just be yourself
Don't ask us why
Cause if you don't we'll make you fly

[Hook]
You can't be me, I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
I guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think the light won't be ever lit
It's almost over now
Almost over now
Something's on your chest
Better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gonna take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now

You can't be me
I'm a rockstar
I'm rhyming on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my .44 pops far
It's almost over now
It's almost over now
I guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mantle or will you see the skies
It's almost over now, almost over now

[Outro]
No one Ever Really Dies
Do you believe that?
Well if not, for you, it's almost over now, almost over now
