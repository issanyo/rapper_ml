[Intro]
It's a revolution
Hmm, yeah, hmm, yeah
Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi]
Aa-aaa-ay, a-aaa-ay
Aa-aaa-ay, a-aaa-ay

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Now, I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby (uh)
Surfin' on my own wave, baby (uh)
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Uh, tonight is electrical
I done told y'all, this the cinema
I am on my Kubrick horn
Like a Spielberg Close Encounter form
Feelin' awesome to be black
And I'm murkin' all competition
Makin' what I want and that's a flex
Can't do what you want, now ain't that a bitch?
Slow up for no one when the show come
Magical feel in my palms
Make ‘em go dumb with them hums
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Now, I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby (uh)
Surfin' on my own wave, baby (uh)
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
The industry is so full of shit
Welcome y'all to the enema
Nah, man, no subliminal
Cause they insecure, they know who they are
Feelin' awesome to be black
And I'm murkin' all competition
Everything that I do is a flex
If you don't get me, not my issue, bitch
Slow up for no one, the shogun
Got the magic in my palms
Make ‘em go dumb with them hums
Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Now, I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave

[Pre-Hook: Kid Cudi]
Aa-aaa-ay, a-aaa-ay
Aa-aaa-ay, a-aaa-ay

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Now, I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
I ain't ridin' no waves
Too busy making my own waves, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave, baby
Surfin' on my own wave
