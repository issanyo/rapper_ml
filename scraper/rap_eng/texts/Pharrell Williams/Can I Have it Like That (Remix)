[Verse]

Asking can i have it like thats a bad habit
Sporadic flow have em' goin' jack rabbit
And them karats finna glow, the gold, the hoes flock
Fuckin' froze from the goal, but know where i go, top, Let em have it
In the Honda, smoke in the backseat, the problem
Shown from last week, puffin' the last weed
My noggin broke, my pockets broke, who want em'?
Worst event occurred on this earth when Pa broke the condom
I'm one hell of a cat, devilish raps
Embellished in cash from selling a bag of the killa
Kush mistook one step, the gat'll kill ya'
Addict for not the average actions i feel ya'
You filter, fake, look at these fuckin' phonies
Tryna get on top of cheese like pepperoni
Final testimony I'm sentenced for life
With bars like these i believe it's only right
Fuck it i need a six pack, zig zags
All rolled up ready to go, shit is heavy in the dome
I can sense that mismatch
When anyone tryna make me irrelevant, fuck it just let me vent
Set on dead presidents, said let em' in
So Biltmore Estate I make my next residence
And anybody tryna stop me
Can suck the dick, shit I'm just being cocky
You watching the time elapse, my rhyming stats accumulate
Better find love in lieu of hate, to do today
Get high, neighbors hushin' the loud
Rap dead when I'm shuttin' my mouth, yo its SiD and I'm out
