Smackdown is like when you give it to her real good She like this is so good what am I doin' Call me WWF
Weezy will fuck you to death
Shhh... can't here me now
Got your panties to the ground
When your man is outta town
I'm a mother fucker ain't I
Girl you know you can't like
That's why I got you walkin crooked like insane eye
And she say her boyfriend is like watchin paint dry
So I let her get on my dick and make her do the macarina
I make her touch her toes
I'm flyin this like crows
Right now I'm Lil Wayne but I'm a jangin on my clothes
And yes I eat pussy
As long as she dushy
And I put the smackdown and he could'nt

Holla that girl (smackdown)

When I call that ass just come thru but you don't wanna leave now do you? (smackdown)
