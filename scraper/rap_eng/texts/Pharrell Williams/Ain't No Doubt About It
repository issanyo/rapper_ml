[Hook: Justin Timberlake & Pharrell]
I just wanna touch ya, yeah, the way you move
(The way you move)
Oh, you make me love you, yeah, cause lady you cool
That's the way, you move it baby
(That's the way, you move it, baby)
Tell your girls, to come join our table
(Tell your girls, come join our table)
And don't you worry, just keep movin, boo
(Don't you worry, keep movin, boo)
Cause you're the star, everybody looking at you
(You're the star, said they're looking at you, girl)
And there ain't no doubt about it
Girl, the way you move
And there ain't no doubt about it
Hey, girl, baby, you cool

[Verse 1]
G-A-M-E, drop top Bent-a-ley
Gucci belt buckle fresh out of Italy
I'm a baller, literally
Haters are swine flu, you're killing me
I'm looking down on you from where the ceiling be
Me and my niggas swarm on you like the killer bees
My chick riding shotgun, Billie Jean
Half Belizian, half from the Phillipines
Niggas energy, is like they got the heaves
Sick of me think they wanna nine milly me
But they ain't for rat tat tat-tat tat
My bullets sing like their registered to ASCAP
Need I say more out in Singapore
Everything I do exotic I don't need to bring a broad
Mr. Red Carpet, I don't do awards
You want it I done it five million on tour, offshore

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ayo Pharrell, I'm ri-ri-diculous, so-so sick with it
You can call me cancer but I don't smoke cigarettes
Come through in a 'rarri same color as licorice
If I ain't with her my bitch like "this my nigga's shit"
Haters beware, I can see clear
Through the lens on these black Louis V's yeah
Something 'bout Mary, make me wanna blow up
And P got the 'disiac for me when I show up
Whip game crazy I call it all kinda
You a big fish to swim the piranhas
Used to call me "Dope Game" when I copped from Jose
Now I play the Roosevelt and I cop Rose
(Niggas be like yo you lease that? No way)
California Slim license plate St. Tropez
Eat at a table full of toupees, lobsters
Been a mobster since the two-way holla

[Hook]
