Well she was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
Ooo, when I saw her standing there?
Well she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Woo, when I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Woo, since I saw her standing there
Well my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooo, since I saw her standing there
Well since I saw her standing there
Well since I saw her standing there
