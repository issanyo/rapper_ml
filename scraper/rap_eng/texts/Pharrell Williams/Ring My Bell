[Intro]
If you wanna talk to me
That's exactly what you're gonna have to do, talk to me

[Verse 1]
When we first met, you had a lot to give
I said, "If I was in your shoes, I could not lose"
But now, baby, I just don't know
I'm so confused, all this abuse is strange
Cause you don't act like my friend
And I can't pretend, I don't want this to end

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy said, my momma said
My sisters say, my life says

[Chorus]
Lose your attitude (ring my bell)
Say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell)
Something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)

[Verse 2]
You, you, you really have some nerve
Playing stupid games, calling me names
And now, you wanna eat those words
Once you attack, you can't take it back
It's strange, I guess off your high horse you're fallin'
You've callin' and callin', I don't understand at all (come on)

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy said (what?), my momma said (huh?)
My sisters say (what they say?), my life says

[Chorus]
Lose your attitude (ring my bell)
Say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell)
Something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)

[Refrain]
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (my bell)
Ring my bell
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (my bell)
Ring my bell

[Bridge]
When you look in the mirror, don't know what to see?
Life's not the same until you're in pain
I know it's just a little hate, I don't want to say
It might be to late for you
I'm not answering your phone call
Babe, if you want more, you come to my front door

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy said (what?), my momma said (huh?)
My sisters say (what they say?), my brother says

[Chorus]
Lose your attitude (ring my bell)
Say you're sorry (ring my bell)
Got something for me (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)
Show some gratitude (ring my bell)
Something nice to say (ring my bell)
You appreciate (ring my bell)
Then you can (ring my bell)

[Refrain]
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (my bell)
Ring my bell
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (you can't)
Ring my, ring my bell (my bell)
Ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell (hey!)
