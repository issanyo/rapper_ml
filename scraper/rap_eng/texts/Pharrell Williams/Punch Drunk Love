[Hook: Kanye West]
'ey baby, am I crazy?
Or was you givin me the eye?
You said maybe? (Yea) Well, you crazy
Because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly (You hype!)
Already know I'm too fly
Yeah, I know what you like

[Verse 1: Common]
Right now I'm off the wine, wine, we can take our time, time
So much I want to punch spill the bump when we grind
My uh is in ya body, my uh is in ya mind
Check my dictionary, that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knock and I knock, uhh, can I come inside?
I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs
It's the joy and the pain and the bites and the brain
What make it feel so good, that type of stuff you can't explain
I do, what I do, to do, to make it rain
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad ya came
'Cause you the type of dame to be game and yo
Mic check like the way I begin my show
Girl I come from chica' so in I 'go
Turn around, it's about to be a TKO

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
Some call me Com (Com), some call me the Red (Red)
You can call me daddy, I'mma put ya to bed
An appetite for seduction and it gotta be fed
This sexual eruption gotcha hittin ya head
On the board and, knock, you screamin, "Oh Lord"
We exchange like students cause I study a broad
And listen to ya body and, low key party and
I keep pushin and pushin, you pump the vol-i-ume up
We the type to make lovin we up
We take a ride down south cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was savin it up
I'm the doctor, I can hold it 'til patience is up
Ah, ah, ah-ah - I make, I make I make it hot baby
Ah, ah-ah - I know, I know, I know ya spot baby
When we do it like we don't want it to end
It's three PM we gon' do it again

[Hook]

[Bridge: Pharrell]
C'mon girl, let's go
To distant lands unknown
We can fly on air
If love is every where for you and me

[Hook] + [Bridge]
