The mission is to make you forget
And now is all the time that we get
How could you say you're not into it
Trust me
God is my witness

Just say goodbye to love
I feel like I'm nowhere
Say goodbye to love
I feel like I'm nowhere
Just say goodbye to love

Its got my mind in a twist
I can't think or see straight
I guess I'm leavin it up to fate
Its all in what you make of it

Just say goodbye to love
I feel like I'm nowhere
Say goodbye to love
I feel like I'm nowhere
Just say goodbye to love

Don't you know it goes
On and on
Gone we're gone
On and on
We're gone, we're gone
On and on
Gone, gone
Gone, gone
On
