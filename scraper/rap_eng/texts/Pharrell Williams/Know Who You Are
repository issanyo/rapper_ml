[Refrain: Pharrell]
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy hours
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a sail
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress

[Hook: Pharrell]
When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good

[Refrain: Alicia Keys]
You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
(I want every woman to make a pledge with me)
Say your name, I pledge, to live life, on the edge
Want you to know, I see, the power, is in me
No more, acquiesce, standin' up, with no stress
I, will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good

[Refrain: Alicia Keys]
You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
Let me tell you one more time
I don't mind
I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin'

[Refrain: Alicia Keys]
You know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels

[Refrain: Both]
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Let me tell you one more time
I don't mind
I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin'

[Outro: Both]
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
Yes I do
