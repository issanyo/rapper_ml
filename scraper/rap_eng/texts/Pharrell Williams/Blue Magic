[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
Benevolent's cold listen up peep game
Every pic that I take is called a freeze frame
That's called a delay
Cause I need to breathe air call me a weak flame
I hopped on the beat so you can hear me say
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave
From here to VA, got my cheese on my mind but I'm not Green Bay
So play me once, and that's a free play
Then play me twice, that's called a replay
But by the third time then you've got to prepay
Cause my flow is so sick that it should decay
In fact you don't even got to hear me say
You know I've got more drive than a freeway
It shows when you run the track like a relay
Cause I always mix it up like my name is DJ
Ever since I stepped foot into the game
I've stood out more than a white bleach stain
I hit every bar hard everyday
Never leave a bar tender, I am not T-Pain
Never be a sellout, I don't touch E-Bay
But I sell out stores in less than three days
Girls say, "Please stay, we'll have a how do we say?
Manege?, Menage?" A three way?
Naw, just consider me straight
They be hating when they leave they be like, "He's Gay"
What?! I am not Ving Rhames
I've been crowned hella early, I am now King James
Hold up wait, let me rephrase
Brought heat to the top, I am now D Wade
Hot like the peach state, Atlanta GA
Even my hair looks hot so I call them heat waves
Not trying to sound clich√©
But I put my family first any day
Adam's in Philly eating real cheesesteak
And my brother's right here and his name is DK
And Leon's trying to make the NBA
If I didn't name you, you've either betrayed
Me or I couldn't rhyme every name
And I rhymed anyways
