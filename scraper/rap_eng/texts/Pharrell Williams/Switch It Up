[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Black ambition, not
Blacks in prison, no
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
All the shit I've been through
On my third strike, I done sinned too
Got 'em in 18 or break
Best coke era, I done lived through
Rest in peace to real gold diggers
Might've fucked a whole crew of millionaires
Young bitches pick and choose wrong
Stuck with a baby, cry a million tears
I done had the realest nigga's bitch
I done seen the realest niggas snitch
Had some homies fresh outta prison
Get a job, seen the realest niggas switch
New ways, new days
401Ks, hoes love 'em
Whisperin', "The dope boy's dead"
Says the credit card, mothafuckas

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Black ambition, not
Blacks in prison, no
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go
