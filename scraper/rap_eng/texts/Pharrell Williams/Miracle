So, just sing it on
Sing it on
Sing it on
So, just sing it on
Sing it on
Sing it on

Here me in the trouble, so much struggle
I could use your help and hand, oh oh
I want some peace, some sweet release
Pull me up from the sinking sand, oh oh
Waiting on heaven
Send out some healing for this heart
Down by the river
Waiting for this water to just come
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
So gonna change my mind
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
Before I run out of time

I believe in miracles
The spiritual things we hold
I believe in vanity
Like ?? like when we breathe
Waiting on heaven
Send out some healing for this heart
Down by the river
Waiting for this water to just come
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
So gonna change my mind
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
Before I run out of time

Hold on, I'm waiting for you
Hold on, what are you gonna do?
Hold on, I'm waiting for you
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, I'm waiting for you
Hold on, what are you gonna do?
Hold on, I'm waiting for you
Hold on, hold on

Waiting on heaven
Send out some healing for this heart
Down by the river
Waiting for this water to just come
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
So gonna change my mind
(Sing it on)
I need a miracle
(Sing it on)
Before I run out of time
