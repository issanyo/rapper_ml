[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Remembering the very first time
You caught that someone specials eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(I hope)
I wanna back to then
Got to figure out how, got to remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it to fill me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listening
And something is missing

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(I hope)
I wanna go back to then
Gotta figure out how, gotta remember when
I felt it, it thrilled me
I want it to fill me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

[Bridge: Madonna]
I remember when
You were the one, you were my friend
You gave me life, you were the sun
You taught me things, I didn't run
I fell to my knees, I didn't know why
I started to breathe, I wanted to cry
I need a reminder so I can relate
I need to go back there before it's too late

[Interlude: Madonna]
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
And one of those things that used to get you down
Now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)

Incredible
Let's finish what we started
Incredible
You're welcome to my party
I don't want this to end
I am missing my best friend
It was incredible, there is no reason
Sex with you is incredible
(Hey girl) Just finish what we started
(Let's finish where we started, girl)
Incredible (Hey girl)
You're welcome to my party
(I'm coming to your party, girl)
Don't want this thing to end
I am missing my best friend
Yes, it was incredible
There's no reason to pretend

[Interlude: Madonna]
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body movin'

[Breakdown: Madonna & Pharrell Williams]
It's incredible, unbelievable
It's incredible, unachievable
It's incredible, metaphysical
It's incredible
(Sex with you is...)
