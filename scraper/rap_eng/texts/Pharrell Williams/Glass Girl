How come everything that seems so good is really bad?
How could it be that it was all just nothing that we had?
You're in denial, it's done babe, It's not working
It's been a while so how come it's not numb yet?
This is hurting

Can't hide it in your smile or hide it in your arms
Sorry to tell you Ms. Glass Girl, I know who you are
I can't read hands and surely not the stars
But sorry to tell you Ms. Glass Girl, I know who you are, yeah

All rivers lead to oceans
Where there's smoke there's fire that's what they tell me
Got no sixth sense
Just this notion
Your eyes scream liar, you cannot help it

I should have known from Glastonbury last year, was it June?
When everyone was so excited to go there, but not you
He must be some great rockstar, tattooed and shirtless
Well maybe since you like being his new clown, join his circus

Can't hide it in your style or hide it in your charm
Sorry to tell you Ms. Glass Girl, I know who you are
God laughs at our plans, oh what a laugh
Sorry to tell you Ms. Glass Girl, we know who you are

All rivers lead to oceans
Where there's smoke there's fire that's what they tell me
Got no sixth sense
Just this notion
Your eyes scream liar, you cannot help it

So there you have it
Breakups are always hard
Especially when you're young
I guess that's just it
I'm too young to be committed

I got nothing else to say, no need to further complicate
Find me something now to break
Don't touch me I'll be OK
Karma had its way today
I don't like you in the worst way
