[Verse 1: Nelly]
I can’t wait to spend this money
Spend it all on you
It don’t matter what it is, what it cost, girl
See I’m on pay per view
She's standing on the couches
Bottles in the air
She's dancing on the tables (don’t worry)
My account keeps the business running
That’s what rich niggas do

[Bridge: Nelly]
Put your number in my phone
I’m almost gone
Too much Patron
(Shots shots shots)
Here alone
Hey what I’m on
In my zone
Everybody get down
Yea, I’m rich bitch freeze

[Hook: Nelly]
Like Rick James
Fire in the hole
Everybody in the zone
Baby hold my phone
Like what? (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Rick James
Fire in the hole
Everybody on the floor
Too early to go home
Like what? (oh oh oh oh oh oh)

[Verse 2: Nelly]
I said I can’t wait to spend this money
(Do you hear me?)
Girl what you wanna do?
(Nah Listen)
I don’t drive or park no cars girl
See I park avenue
She’s standing on the couches
Bottles in the air
She's dancing on the tables
How about I send my pilot for you baby?
That’s what rich niggas do

[Verse 3: T.I.]
You know we parlaying all day
In a mansion in Miami, keep it full LeBron playin
Yellow gold, Scott Dweller, solitaire park bay
Whenever I say it they ménage it
Vegas, stumbling up out of the club
High as elegant, now you’re looking for love
Call your girl if you’re lookin for her
Nah I ain’t going for it like a bong I’m drinkin pourin
In the strip club where the girls ain’t getting naked
Me and five, six girl, body out of this world
Pretty pull strings to a lot of these girls
Take a hit of it, get high with me girl

[Bridge: Nelly]
Who tryna get sky high?
(Me and my girls)
Raise your hands if you want it twice
Who’s feelin right?
(Me and my girls)
Am I the shit bitch?
(Yeah)
