[Chorus]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (crashing down)
Crashing down (crashing down)
When everyone's around, I bet
You would've paid up all your cash down (your cash down)
To not make a sound (to make a sound)
But everyone knows now

[Verse 1]
(So you're sad) about the moment, you lost your love (Damn)
You couldn't see her leaving (You were gassed)
And that's sucks don't it, cause God yanked the rug (Damn)
And holding your heart, will not help you breathe

[Chorus]
Sooner or later it all comes crashing down (crashing down)
Crashing down (crashing down)
When everyone's around, I bet
You would've paid up, all your cash down (your cash down)
To not make a sound (to make a sound)
But everyone knows now

[Bridge]
It all comes crashing
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it

[Verse 2]
(So you're sad) and you should own it, and you fucked up (Damn)
You thought that you were the team (You were gassed)
And now your opponent who wears your gloves (Damn)
A nightmare just ate up your dreams

[Chorus]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (crashing down)
Crashing down (crashing down)
When everyone's around, I bet
You would've paid up, all your cash down (your cash down)
To not make a sound (to make a sound)
But everyone knows now

[Bridge]
It all comes crashing
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over

[Verse 3]
(So you're sad) could've had so much done, you blew it off (Damn)
Your chances passing you by (You were gassed)
Time waits for no one, and it cost for a loss (Damn)
A cosmic joke, should you laugh or cry?

[Chorus]
Sooner or later, it all comes crashing down (crashing down)
Crashing down (crashing down)
When everyone's around, I bet
You would've paid up, all your cash down (your cash down)
To not make a sound (to make a sound)
But everyone knows now

[Bridge]
It all comes crashing
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it (oh)
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
(Down) It's over, leave it
