[Verse 1]
She wants to be up there
In the air where the clouds live
The sweetest seeds make the best trees
30,000 feet she can smile and now

[Pre-Chorus]
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kicking in?

[Chorus]
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?

[Verse 2]
She wants to introduce me
To her friend Eddie
What is she trying to do to me?
He got words that rhyme
He got a dirty mind
Persuasive
Am I about to do it now?

[Pre-Chorus]
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kicking in?

[Chorus]
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?

[Break]
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce

[Pre-Chorus]
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
She wants to hit the clouds
Honey are you up there now
She puts the shot glass down
She asks for another round
Girl don't you hit the ground
Is it kicking in?

[Chorus]
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
You can feel it, it's kicking in
Honey are you up there?
