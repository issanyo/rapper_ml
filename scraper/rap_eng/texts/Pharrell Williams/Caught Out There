[Intro]
Yeah this song yeah
This song is for all the women out there
That have been lied to by their men
And I know you all been lied to
Over and over again
This is for y'all, maybe didn't break
The way you should've broke
But I break you know I'm sayin' so
This is how it goes, damn

[Verse 1]
Last year, Valentine's Day
You would just warmly say
"Babe I love you, love you, babe I swear"
Held you when you were sick, even...
The whole time I'd think to myself
This isn't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see? (NO)
You don't come home to me (oh no)
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat and you're
Caught out there!

[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now

[Verse 2]
So sick of your games
I'll set your truck to flames
And watch it blow up, blow up, tell me
How you gonna see her now?
So far from sincere
Fabrications in my ear
Drive me so far up the wall, I come slidin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see (I don't believe this)
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
I can't deal, can't bear (I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies but to your surprise
Look, I hope you're happy since you're
Caught out there

[Interlude]
Yeah, you've been caught (Yo come on)
Yo, yo, yo yo yo
Yo, yo, yo yo yo
Come on

[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now

[Verse 3]
She's so raunchy, so vulgar
Not me, why the hell her?
Look she dresses, a mess (Look at her)
What do you see? (I don't know)
It's not all about cash (hell no)
Nor how much you flash
How I dress is a reflection of me

[Pre-Chorus]
What is this I see
You don't come home to me
When you don't come home to me
Can't deal, can't bear (told you I won't)
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look I got something for y'all since you're
Caught out there

[Chorus]
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aaaaaaaaaaaah
I hate you so much right now
