[Pharrell: Verse 1]
Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

[Stevie: Verse 1]

[All: Bridge]
We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[All: Chorus]
She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky (x4)

[Stevie: Verse 2]
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling
If you wanna leave, I'm with it

[Pharrell: Bridge]

[Daft Punk: Hook]
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get harder
We're up all night to get better
We're up all night to get faster
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
We're up all night to get stronger

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

[All]
Ahh, freak out!

We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
[All]
Freak out!
[Daft Punk]
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
[All]
Freak out!
[Daft Punk]
Harder, better, faster, stronger
[All]
Freak out!
[Daft Punk]
More than ever, hour after, our work is never over

[Bridge: All]
[Chorus: All]

[All]
La la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la

[Stevie: Another Star]
For you
There might be a brighter star
But in my eyes
The light of you is all I see
