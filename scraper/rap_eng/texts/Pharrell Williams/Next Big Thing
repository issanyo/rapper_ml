It's the next big thing
It's the next big thing

We've arrived
At your service, we're alive
Bet you didn't know
You require us to thrive

[Hook]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We are the new endeavor, we'll keep you looking clever
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
But you can't be next forever
It's the next big thing
It's the next big thing

You're distracted
So distracted by the noise around
We've redacted
All the plagiarism you might've found

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
We are the latest greatest, wouldn't you love to date us
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
But you can't be next forever
It's the next big thing
It's the next big thing

You see them bright lights, you see them cameras flashing
My life in slow motion, the world is screamin' action
Them driver's waitin' on me, them bitches clawin' at me
My ex's hatin' on me, I make 'em so unhappy
Changin' phone numbers, all my pass codes
Lot of past hoes actin' like assholes
Can't really say I blame 'em, they hear this name ring
They wish they seen it comin', I'm the next biggest thing

[Hook]

[Pharrell]
Two in the morn we got our sunglasses on
That's the only thing the four of us got on, plus a bong
You the illest of the cities I have gone
Guess that's why I got a picture of your titties in my phone, them nipples
We talk about politics and who we think it would be hard to kiss
Which autobots your mood and transform you to the obvious
You say that sexting is liberating, refreshing
Then ask to take a picture of my Darth Vader helmet

It's the next big thing
