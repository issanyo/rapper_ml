[Verse 1]
I was a little different
I didn't do what the fast girls do
You studied my rhythm
Now you can speed me up when you want to

They were to cool to run my race
You kept the pace with a smile on your face
Go head baby (go head baby)
Then I knew it was you (then I knew it was you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well first you took me around
Introduced me to your family and friends
And told them how once we met that we would never lose
Oh boy

[Chorus]
I decided that you are the him for me, oh boy
Because I decided that you are the him for me, oh my boy

[Verse 2]
How's it feel to win it
When ain't no mountains that you can't move
Your mind is like a prism
For God's light to shine through

They were to cool to run my race
You kept the pace with a smile on your face
Go head baby (go head baby)
Then I knew it was you (then I knew it was you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Well first you took me around
Introduced me to your family and friends
And told them how once we met that we would never lose
Oh boy

[Chorus]
I decided that you are the him for me, oh boy
Because I decided that you are the him for me, oh my boy

[Bridge]
You were running me running me down
Telling me telling me wait
Running me down and telling me you were never gonna let go is the way you got me

You were running me running me down
Telling me telling me wait...

[Chorus]
Because I decided that you are the him for me, oh boy
Because I decided that you are the him for me, oh my boy
Because I decided that you are the him for me, oh my boy
Because I decided that you are the him for me...
