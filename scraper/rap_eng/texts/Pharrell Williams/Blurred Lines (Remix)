[Intro]
Everybody get up
Hey, hey, hey [x3]

[Verse 1: FR33STYLE]
I said girl you look good from head to toe
Your style and physique exceptional
I would tell you but I think you already know
There's some places I'd like for you and I to go
I was thinking 'bout it, oh, a night ago
How you make my head spin - I need Tylenol
I was going through it, eeny meeny miny moe
Now I know it's good, hey it's time to roll
So we stepped outside to the limousine
I knew she loved it by the look she was giving me
We hopped in quick, started living the dream
Blasting champagne everywhere, it was quite the scene
I didn't know what I was doing just followed along
When I began to talk she said "Skip the monologue"
She saw the flashing lights like the Kanye song
Then turned around quick and said "Party on!"

[Outro]
Now shake it out! Get down, get up
Hey I like your shirt, I shoulda said that first
But that's too much work
Hey, I see these blurred lines
I know you love it
I know you love it
You love to flaunt it, I need a good girl
Don't have one, it's tragic
Gonna need some magic
If it works - fantastic
