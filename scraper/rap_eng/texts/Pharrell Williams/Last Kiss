[Intro: Pharrell]
Hey!

[Verse 1: Kent Jamz]
I ain't have no weed or money when I met her now she hate me
Clich√© cheapskate, love to fuckin'  debate
Said she never had a daddy, I ain't used to being patient
Got a lot of spite but that pussy tight, I'ma wait
I can hold a lot of money, she can hold a lot of grudges
I buy a lot of weed and A-C-T like I don't give a fuck
I guess I'm too young for love
Must be lust, too young for love
Must be drugs, too young for love
Must be lust, too young for love
Must be drugs

[Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?

[Post-Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
It's so hard to let go of her
I know it's hard to let go of me
Let your friend just go, it's cold
Cause if you leave, my story goes
So much I read, that you don't know
So better keep, your body close

[Verse 2: Joon]
Girls in and out my phone cause I don't got a clock
Made out of the faces of a bull
Life is Jenga, people are pieces
So the pieces that I pull
Can bring the whole wall tumbling down like Jericho
Hmm, decisions
A wise nigga asked what direction your penis point when erect
Your answer should be straight ahead, he said
That's your future, make sure you aim it correct, I reflect
Man the same things that make you scarred
Evolve you into who you are
Cried a river, built a boat
Got it to float, and wrecked into an epiphany
Now ain't that about a Tiffany
Perception kept you from finding the light in the darkness quicker, My nigga
You fucking up your energy
In the wrong place with the wrong kind of empathy
The soul is in the abs
How else do you explain that funny feeling once you catch feelings
You ain't never too young for lust
And you ain't never too young for drugs
And you ain't never too young for clubs
And you ain't never too young for trust
So you ain't never too young for love

[Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?

[Post-Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
It's so hard to let go of her
I know it's hard to let go of me
Let your friend just go, it's cold
Cause if you leave, my story goes
So much I read, that you don't know
So better keep, your body close

[Verse 3: P]
Let 'em watch girl, get your groove on
Two step, like you heard a Snoop song
Cause you hot, them hoes lukewarm
I love your smile, how you kill 'em with the charm
Ain't gotta front girl, I just wanna dance with you
More for romance, so let me get your hand, yo
You got an ass, make a nigga drop bands
Broke niggas, they could never understand
Just face it, them niggas basic
I'm a billionaire boy, and I ain't ape shit
I hear 'em all bluffing in they conversations
Or they [?], I'ma raise them
Get a real one, you in it for the thrill of it
I got drugs that can never be enough
That good pussy girl, I'm in it for the feel of it
You the bomb, why you chillin' on my arm?

[Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?
Never got a last kiss
Baby do you remember me?

[Post-Hook: Kent Jamz & Pharrell Williams]
It's so hard to let go of her
I know it's hard to let go of me
Let your friend just go, it's cold

So better keep, your body close
