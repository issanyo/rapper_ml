[Verse 1: Madonna]
I should have seen the sign way back then
When she told me that you were her best friend
And now she's rolling, rolling, rolling
And you were stolen, stolen, stolen
She started dressing like me, and talking like me
It freaked me out
She started calling you up in the middle of the night
What's that about?

[Pre-Chorus 1: Madonna]
I just want to be there when you discover
When you wake up next to your new lover
She might cook you breakfast and love you in the shower
The flavor of the moment, 'cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same
It won't be the same

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I should have seen the sign when you were here
Under a different light, it's all so clear
She was stealing, stealing, stealing
And now you're feeling, feeling, feeling
She started dyeing her hair and
Wearing the same perfume as me
She started reading my books
And stealing my looks and lingerie

[Pre-Chorus 2: Madonna]
I just want to be there when you discover
You wake up in the morning next to your new lover
She might make you breakfast and love you in the shower
The thrill is momentary, cause she don't have what's ours

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same
It won't be the same

[Bridge: Madonna]
She is licking her lips and she's batting her eyes
She's not me
She's got legs up to there and such beautiful hair
She's not me
Oh, devoted for life, make a beautiful wife
She's not me
If you spend some more time, I guarantee you will find
She's not me
I know I can do it better

[Verse 3: Madonna]
If someone wants to pimp your style
And hang with you a little while
And make off with all the things you like
You're gonna have to watch out

[Chorus: Madonna]
She's not me
She doesn't have my name
She'll never have what I have
It won't be the same
It won't be the same

[Interlude: Madonna]
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
Never let you forget
She's not me
She's not me, and she never will be

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams]
Gotta find a new way to show your feelings
I guess it was some bullshit, say you love me, love me
Guess my expectations hit the ceiling
When you come back, it will cost us trust me, trust me
Wendy

[Outro: Madonna]
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
She's not me, she's not me
She's not me, and she never will be
She never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me and never will be
Never will be, never will be, never will be
She's not me
Never will be, never will be
