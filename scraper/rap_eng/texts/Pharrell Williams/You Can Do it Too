[Intro]
Ah, my nigga you can do it too
(turn me up, turn me up)
You can do it too
My nigga you can do it too
You can do it too
You can do it too
(Just tellin you, ya know?)

[Verse 1]
Ay yo
Never in a million years I'll imagine I'll get my thrills
By listening to squeals of the PJ wheels
As we land, I duck down, I stick my head up
My dick is being sucked down by a bitch named What Now
I look in her eyes and her eyes are like an orange star
Look at the reflection of my foreign car, the R & R
I stick my feet out, you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel
I was in marching band, I was a skateboarder
Jesus made wine, I couldn't make water
Oxymoronic, I'm here to destroy all you hate hoarders
You niggas was cool in school, now you niggas take orders
I'm not dissin your job
But now you listen and nod
Some Outer Limits shit, I know this position is odd
Don't gasp for air
You can turn blue
Look, excel nigga
Trust me you can do it too

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 2]
I know niggas is like, there's no returning when I
Bought that white 5-50
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch, but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass
Trust me, I'mma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin my cream
I'm Coming To America call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic, you get it
Cause this I've seen
These type of visions, since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class, but with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you
But you can do it too

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Verse 3]
I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has accused
He's really frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next thing bang comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close, my man Lou can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya high sadity cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read Job verse 2, inhale the "oo", and go

[Hook]
You can do it too young love
You can do it too young love
Just watch what you do young love
And watch whose in your crew young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it too young love
I did you can do it too

[Outro: Jamie Cullum]
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky
Don't be afraid to look up the sky

Let me tell you story of my situation
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation
Let me, let me, let me, let me  tell you story of my situation
