(Chorus - Samoht)
Come around
Alien travel thru a land
That he never been
Standing in the rock band
Feet heavy, Timberlands
Here we go again
As the world travels round and round
Head spinning, and then we laugh again
Then I lay down all my troubles at the water
Oceans, oceans

(Verse1 - KiL )
& when it's visuals
Literally Eyes get so critical
Lyrical different see flows
Be so spirituals
Taking in the water
Hoping for a miracle
Praying to see Florida
Oh the shores distant so
Ima do dirt... Hurt whatever
Flirts wit surface issues
Murk the turf the tissues worth
Alert to native lands
I'm first to find this turf
Your worthless as a man
I'm certain that you can't be perfect
..As davincis symphony do it in for me
Burst to have the instant he
Curse the barrel mini me
Country I love it tis of me
Tears of me falling infintely
Blood drip from my slug
I hug the land pretend to be free
We maritime, Liquid property
Straw man just can't be living logically
Give My devotion, To a jail
Uncle Sam the devil we live in hell

(Chorus - Samoht)
Come around
Alien travel thru a land
That he never been
Standing in the rock band
Feet heavy, Timberlands
Here we go again
As the world travels round and round
Head spinning, and then we laugh again
Then I lay down all my troubles at the water
Oceans, oceans


Take a Hot shot of liquor to ease the bitter
Saying my pockets dividends won't deliver
Making my time for clothes , money 
Foes denote me cause these bogust
Lotus flowers bombs console me at they lowest
I'm just needing a warming soul less soul
Be knowing so show some gratitude
That h20 molded me to a hopeless poet
Formed with focus oceans
To mourn these ghostses
Wit that said I'm solo going ghost
The four do into motion
Sor low for the po , love to kicking jive
Fuck July the 4th
I'm independent regardless
Whether you want to po up
Beknown to kicking knowledge
Licks been getting towed
Niggas been getting licked
Since beginning I'm getting em
Plots to wheeling em
Shots or a billion to shut me up
Since that I bleed BLAKKK
You'll be whipping a terrorist ha
I am that nothing you cursed
& turned to something
From being greedy you wanting
My life for a treatie warrant
Tax the air I breath
Collect the love I need
& take away my life for
Money diamonds consignments
I'm finally realizing
Where TF has ya mind been
Into the 7 sins
Swim in the 7 seas
Mixing in with my blood
Ancestors proceeds
My heirs getting them nothing
From everything you received
That we going

(Outro - KiL )
Elephant tusk on the boar of a sailing lady
Docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo
Before the Basquait show and if so
Well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family
This water mixed my blood
This water tells my story
This water knows it all
