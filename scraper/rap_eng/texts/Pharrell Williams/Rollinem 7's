[Intro: RetcH]
Mad ethnic right now

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
All you pearly kings and queens
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You should be considering
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
We can turn you into smithereens
Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
If people take away your walk
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
Are they down?
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
Roll around, I roll around, I'm rollin' them 7's
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
You gotta keep it rollin'
All of my girls wanna be my heaven
You gotta keep it rollin'
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'
Roll around, I roll around, I'm rollin' them 7's
You gotta keep it rollin'

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
The bird in the mystical thunder (tell the truth)
That big yellow ball that we're under (tell the truth)
Workin' and waitin' on orders (tell the truth)
So we just stay open and porous (tell the truth) (huge)
You should hear us as a chorus (tell the truth)
Bitch, we could blow off the doors (tell the truth)
The energy would do it for us (tell the truth)
And get this, we black as the Moors (huge)

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Time pterodactyls over all the way I see
I notice fractals, clover, honey bee, that's why
I kinda cackle, it be funny, see, haha
I ain't an actor, well sometimes I be, action
I got a gash on both my arms and knees, I be
Blockin' Alaska, they be coldin' me, achoo
I can't imagine the hood in harmony, I mean
How can I bask in a bloody Sun if he don't see
Me as a man, so I'm a hunted beast to him
I panoramic, look around, I be on edge
And eggshells, yeah I'm an omelette, a quiche
I catch hell, they throwin' fireballs to me
My bitch yell, pussy, leave my baby alone
I'm like, look girl, get your ass inside, now gon'
I would miss her if I knocked this piggy off
But I deserve the same as white niggas, I thought

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Roll around the world like I do with my brethren
All the pretty girls wanna be my heaven
Every time I turn around, I'm rollin' them 7's
Roll, roll, roll, roll, rollin' them 7's
