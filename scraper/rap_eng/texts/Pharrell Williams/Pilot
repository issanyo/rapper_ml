For this of course is a great opportunity
A - and this beginning is a pilot project I imagine
And you hope that it will develop
And that new things wi-will appear as you work it out

But possibly that we have been thinking so much in the past
Of so many questions on a national scale only
And this was the beginning of thinking on an international scale
