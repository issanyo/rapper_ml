[Chorus]
I got a whole bunch of ways
To turn him on, girl
He'll come home, girl
If you know what I mean
I got a whole bunch of ways
It's all in your tone girl
He'll be gone, girl
If you know what I mean

[Verse 1]
I'll sexify you
Have you thinking about my name
In the middle of the day
(And that's guaranteed)
I'll sexify you
Have your friends thinking
Boy, man, there ain't no way
(And that's guaranteed)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make him want a night for two
Which involves some eye by you
Make his body shake from naughty strokes
And when you call, girl, he'll come home

[Chorus]
I got a whole bunch of ways
To turn him on, girl
He'll come home, girl
If you know what I mean
I got a whole bunch of ways
It's all in your tone girl
He'll be gone, girl
If you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
I'll sexify you
With the bed, me, eyes
And killer confidence
(And that's guaranteed)
I'll sexify you
Just make sure that he got enough
Beware, he'll be popping up
Makes sense
(And that's guaranteed)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Be open to play his game
And then the fun will start all over again
Keep it going, girl, don't stop
And he will want you on top

[Chorus]
I got a whole bunch of ways
To turn him on, girl
He'll come home, girl
If you know what I mean
I got a whole bunch of ways
It's all in your tone girl
He'll be gone, girl
If you know what I mean

[Bridge]
(You've got to make your mark)
I just want some hanky-panky
(He'll never forget who you are)
Sexy versus skanky
(It'll change him)
Dancing in my bra and panties, girl
(He'll always come home)
Instincts to master, thank me, thank me

[Chorus]
I got a whole bunch of ways
To turn him on, girl
He'll come home, girl
If you know what I mean
I got a whole bunch of ways
It's all in your tone girl
He'll come home, girl
If you know what I mean

[Outro]
I just want some hanky-panky
Sexy versus skanky
Dancing in my bra and panties
Instincts to master, thank me, thank me
I just want some hanky-panky
Sexy versus skanky
Dancing in my bra and panties, girl
Instincts to master, thank me, thank me
