[Intro]
I don't wanna be what you want me to be
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
It's over

[Hook] x2
Now what do you keep calling for
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)
It's over, it's over
(What do you keep calling for, what do you keep calling for)

[Verse 1]
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled
I don't wanna be what you want me to be (don't wanna be)
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
Oh, the clothes I bought you could still wear (still wear)
Did you store the cards and teddy bears (ooh)
See there I go again sticking my nose
I'm sorry it's my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough (strange enough)
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful, yeah (painful)
You know we used to talk about our future
It ain't just all my fault (I know, I know, I know we used to talk about it, babe)
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall (leaves would fall)
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl (we would cry)
Just say goodbye
To the walks and talks and the dark in the park
And it ain't just all my fault (hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
We lost a four leaf clover
Don't ask why shorty be over
News flash shorty we over
We like Def Jam and Hova
We like Bobby and Whitney
Except without the kiddies
Like Pamela Anderson's career
Except without the titties
We had some good times didn't we
I know I won't forget that
But we had some bad times and
That's time I wish I could get back
We coulda had it all
But I guess we'll never know
You been around me long enough
To know that now it's over

[Hook] x4

[Outro] x3
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
