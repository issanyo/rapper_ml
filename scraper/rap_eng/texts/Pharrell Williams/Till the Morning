We 'bout to take y'all way back

Til the
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)
Til the
(Morning, to the sweet stuff, let me heat up)

Make me lose my mind, lose track of time
But I gotta work
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)

You keep sending messages you wanting me
But instant messages don't be as cold
If you wanna get me, put your energy
You should try it in my hand not on the phone

I'm sensitive when you come close
Boy, come on 'cause I'm getting low
I love it when you do that soul
Turn it up that turns me on

Til the
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)
Til the
(Morning, to the sweet stuff, let me heat up)

Make me lose my mind, lose track of time
But I gotta work
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)

I can see you know most wrapped up in the sheet
You got me going crazy, screaming more
If you wanna get me like you want me to be
Then you gotta stop me from dancing on the floor

I'm sensitive when you come close
Boy, come on 'cause I'm getting low
I love it when you do that soul
Turn it up that turns me on

Til the
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)
Til the
(Morning, to the sweet stuff, let me heat up)

Make me lose my mind, lose track of time
But I gotta work
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)

Okay, we gonna take you to the rooftop, c'mon
Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me
Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me

Now did you like it?
How did you feel?
Was it good to ya?
Can you give a little more?

But relax now, baby
Let me ease your mind
Let me get it together
And I'll be ready to go

(Hey, baby)
I'm sensitive when you come close
(So sensitive)
Boy, come on 'cause I'm getting low
I love it when you do that soul
(I love it, baby)
Turn it up that turns me on
(Turn me on)

Til the
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)
Til the
(Morning, to the sweet stuff, let me heat up)

Make me lose my mind, lose track of time
But I gotta work
(Morning, can you touch me, can you help me?)

Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me
Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me

Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me
Touch me, hold me, kiss me closely
Teach me, show me, enjoy me
