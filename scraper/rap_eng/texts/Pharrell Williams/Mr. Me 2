[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
I'm untouchable, sitting in the range, so comfortable
Nothing on my on my feet, got some weed that I'm puffin' on
Ain't nothing wrong, I'm just hanging with this honey jon
Hoping that I get the nod, bring it on, slutty broad
[repeat]

Throw on the CD, don't believe what be coming on
Nothing but the beat Skate P, let me run up on
The beat he drumming got me coming up wit something raw
Beat me up and cuff me to the gutters if I'm fronting dog
But if you're smart, put your money on the underdog
Over under cup, a hundred, nothing ever done before
Yeah, I'm a senator, sent to put an end to y'all
With my incentive, being steady in my repertoire
Pepper the record with, that has never been said before
Every deep breathe is impressive, get the impression broad
I learned that all the hard work pays off
I intend to be a legend when this ends, up in the record stores
Yeah, yeah, when the ending calls
If it ends at all
Shit, it could end tomorrow
And I bet heaven doesn't let me in, they read it wrong
Asher Paul, Asher Roth, don't forget it homes
Take it home, write it down, baby keep it close
There's a quiz after this, hope you taken notes
Paying close attention to the metronome
Setting up a pension when I mention I'm professional
I'm 'bout to get it on
Getting all my weapons drawn
Letting out a sentence that could empty out the pentagon
I been intending on amending the 2nd law
But we getting money man, we need to bare our arms
Ha, ha, ha, damn, I'm charming
Don't be alarmed, I've been involved
It's normal for me
Your homies know me
The flow is so, geez, oh man, I seen the impossible
Don't ignore me. Call an army
By sea, by land, you'll need a whole arsenal
Bossing, I'm launching this fall up as an artist
Work the hardest 'till my heart isn't all in it, flawless
Aight, awesome bra, good talk
It's the music I use to induce thought
So let me do what I do with my crew y'all
A crew that doesn't include you, Mr. me 2
