[Verse 1: Madonna]
See which flavor you like and I'll have it for you
Come on in to my store, I've got candy galore
Don't pretend you're not hungry, I've seen it before
I've got Turkish delight, baby, and so much more

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Get up out of your seat (your seat)
Come on up to the dance floor
I've got something so sweet (so sweet)
Come on up to the front door
I need plenty of heat (heat)
Form a special confection
Just start moving your feet (your feet)
Move on over to me

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'll be your one stop (one stop)
Candy shop (candy shop)
Everything (everything)
That I got (that I got)
I'll be your one stop (one stop)
Candy store (candy store)
Lollipop (lollipop)
Have some more (have some more)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
All the suckers are not what we sell in the store
Chocolate kisses so good, you'll be beggin' for more
Don't pretend you're not hungry, there's plenty to eat
Come on into my store, 'cause my sugar is sweet

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Get up out of your seat (your seat)
Come on up to the dance floor
I've got something so sweet (so sweet)
Come on up to the front door
I need plenty of heat (heat)
Form a special confection
Just start moving your feet (your feet)
Move on over to me

[Chorus: Madonna]
I'll be your one stop (one stop)
Candy shop (candy shop)
Everything (everything)
That I got (that I got)
I'll be your one stop (one stop)
Candy store (candy store)
Lollipop (lollipop)
Have some more (have some more)

[Bridge: Madonna]
Sticky and sweet (dance, dance)
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet (Dance, dance)
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
My sugar is raw; sticky and sweet
Sticky and sweet (dance, dance)
