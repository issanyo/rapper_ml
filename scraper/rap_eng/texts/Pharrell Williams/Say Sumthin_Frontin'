[Verse 1]
Probably 'cross the ocean, maybe out at sea
I just wanna know you're still with me
Somewhere on a jet plane, smilin' or asleep
I've been waiting oh so patiently

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hold you back, no
I don't wanna keep you down
I just wanna know we're both on solid ground
You ain't gotta paint a picture
I just wanna hear a sound
I just wanna know you're good, girl

[Chorus]
Darling won't you say something?
Say something
Darling won't you say something?
Say something
Won't you say something?

[Verse 2]
Head is in the clouds now, shooting through the sky
What is to become of you and I?
Going through the motion, waiting for a sign
I just need to know that you're alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hold you back, no
I don't wanna keep you down
I just wanna know we're both on solid ground
You ain't gotta paint a picture
I just wanna hear a sound
I just wanna know you're good, girl

[Chorus]
Darling won't you say something?
(Say it to me)
Say something
(Tell me what you need)
Darling won't you say something?
(Say it to me)
Say something
(Tell me what you need)
Standing in the hallway
I've been losing sleep
Are you slipping through my fingers?
Need to hear you speak
Darling won't you say something?
(Say it to me)
Say something

[Bridge]
Oh don't you go nowhere
Oh don't you go nowhere, go nowhere
Just say something (say something)
Just say something (say something)
Darling won't you say something? (say something)
Just say something (say something)
I've been losing sleep
Are you slipping through my fingers?
Need to hear you speak
Just say something
(Say it to me, tell me what you need, boy)

[Outro]
Tell me what you need, boy

[Mash-Up Verse]
I don't mean to sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't messing at no other dudes cause you love me
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me
So then we tried - taking it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear your ass up (tear your ass up)

I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off
I was just fronting (you know I want you babe)
I'm ready to bury it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want you (you should stop fronting babe)

[Chorus]
Darling won't you say something?
Say something
Darling won't you say something?
Say something
