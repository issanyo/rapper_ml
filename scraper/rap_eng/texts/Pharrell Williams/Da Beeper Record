(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
We in the VIP and we sipping on bub'
I'm in the VIP and I'm lighting up drugs
I keep a four fifth right down by my nuts
See me on my two way and I keep it blowing cous'

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Hit me on my beeper
Hit me on my beeper
Hit me on my beeper
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Hit me on my beeper
Hit me on my beeper

[Verse 1: Fam-Lay]
You want it I got it you need it
Own it you got it come see it
Hate that they got to compete with
Prices I doubt that they beat it
Narcotics you got to come get it
Straight money got to come with it
Telling you not that my shit is
Bigger than knuckles on midgets
I carry that forty, nigga, I carry that cake cous'
With smokers on me, killer, I get that paper
I got exotic, homie
I pump that purple, homie
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
That's how I got it, homie
I ducked them turtles, homie
Catch me on the night shift like the Commodores
You was 'bout that bullshit, what you call me for
Watching my cash stack, I got the metal handle
I keep a knapsack, full of the devil's candy
Long as I keep it it's selling
Act like you keep it you welling
Sick of that bullshit you yelling
Hurt cause your people keep telling
Know that you broke cause it's showing
'Sposed to have coke and you blowing
Before I know niggas you owing
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
Talking 'bout kicking your door in

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay]
For one you get two of them on Tuesdays
Or that then your workers is useless
Think that I'm just doing music
It's just to keep deputies clueless
Niggas is wopping and popping
China white moving, no stopping
Put a nice groove in my pocket
Nobody's rude as my Glock is
Walk in the club and they on us
Not that they love us, they want us
One of them want to just know us
The other one want to just bone us
But i don't fuck anything, it's got to be something that's banging
[?] I'm on my way to be slanging
One time if the shit don't be there
Cause them niggas come quick like an e-mail
They coming up the block, two ladies buck naked
They picking out a spot, to let the mutt chase it
Guaranteed the police in their holler
Chevy Caprice and them Dodges
Niggas is creeping and dodging
Cause niggas ain't beating them charges
Don't let them stop you, you dirty
Dirty, don't stop it, keep swerving
(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
Put the shit out on the curb or
You won't get out 'til you thirty

(Walking down the block with life in my pocket)
You know when it's legit they
Call it "heart attack" cous'

They catch a heart attack, cous'
Catch a heart attack, cous'
