[Intro]
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
Hold up, to be clear (yeah)
I believe in miracles (yeah)
But I don't believe in waitin' for 'em (nah)
You gotta make that shit happen (yeah)
In ways they cannot imagine (yeah)
Make them think it's magic (Yeah)
It ain't your chain or your vehicles (yeah)
When you that nigga with the bag (yeah)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Just be that nigga with the bag (yeah)
So when they say, "Who is that?" (yeah)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (yeah)
They be like, "Who that rolling past?" (yeah)
Oh, that's that nigga with the bag
Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Let this motivate ya, turn you up (uh huh)
Make you ravenous, you know they gon' try and curve you
Know they hate you, don't let the fuck niggas burn you up (nope)
Use this as fuel, you know that deep-down body thirst
That light out in the streets (yeah)
So the gatekeepers hold up
They just let you go, you, you go, you go
Let you go, you go, you go

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Just be that nigga with the bag (yeah)
So when they say, "Who is that?" (yeah)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag  (yeah)
That close encounter riding past
(What's that spaceship riding past?)
That be the nigga with the bag
Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo

[Verse 2: Station Wagon P]
Skrrt, Station Wagon P, I'm just danglin' my keys
Open up the door and take the danger out the G
Take the G out the danger with the alien degree
Paparazzi yellin' freeze while the cops are yellin' freeze
From the ambulance, that nigga dyin' in the street
He do the Hammer Dance and his killer blowin' weed
Like it's some hammer pants
He is numb, he don't feel it like a pack of Xans
They ridin' different colored ghosts like it's Pac-Man
But don't run up on the window, you get blast, man
I hear Chris Tucker in the backseat yellin', "Yes, man!''
They ain't your friend if shit go down and they leave your ass
I told you drones was on your home, need to free your ass
And once you learn it's your turn, nigga, we don't ask
We get a bag so big it has a hole in it, illegal paths
You see the math? (follow)
'Cause we see the path like we're giraffes (follow, follow)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
Hold up to be clear (yeah)
I believe in miracles (yeah)
But I don't believe in waiting for 'em (nah)
You gotta make that shit happen (yeah)
In ways they cannot imagine (yeah)
Make them think it's magic (yeah)
It ain't your chain or your vehicles (yeah)
When you that nigga with the bands (yeah)

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Just be that nigga with the bag (yeah)
So, when they say, "Who is that?" (yeah)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (yeah)
You see that watch, that's made of glass (yeah)
It's on the wrist that grip the bag
Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo

[Bridge: Station Wagon P]
For them the insecurity sets in
You ride around like the Jetsons
You're the sun's reflection
You shinin', come on, hello

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
You see that watch, that's made of glass (Yugo)
It's on the wrist that grip the bag (Yugo)
What was that spaceship ridin' past? (Yugo)
Oh, thatâ€™s that nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do more prayer out here than brag (Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
He do more prayer out here than brag (That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo)
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag (That Yugo, Yugo)
