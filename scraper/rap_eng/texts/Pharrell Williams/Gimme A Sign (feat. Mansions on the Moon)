I used to hang out with the white kids in school
And all the black kids thought I was cool
Now I don't know what that means
But if jealousy's a disease I got the vaccine

And it's just another partly sunny day
In the S-E-A
I remember in Tacoma
Wishing that I was a grown up

So I could take a trip
Or have a cool job and a whip
Now I'm living like a kid
Or Tom Hanks in BIG

10,000 RPMS
We been staying afloat
But now we're gonna start to swim
Writing our own stories

Making our own rules
Go to space
The next day we'll tell 'em it's old news

And this is gonna be the day
For all the hard times
We wanted to get away
We'll finally get a break

And never look back
At chances we didn't take
Buyin' mansions and estates

Because tomorrow's just a day away
Yeah tomorrow's just a day away
Today
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
