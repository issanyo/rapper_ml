Hey we need to stay together girl
Think about it
There was something about me and you girl
Look here

When God created human beings
I bet he didn't think of bombs and things
I bet he wonders why
Just like I never imagined it would be anything between you and me
I know cause I cry
I cry

Chorus
You were my sunrays
Without you girl there was no days
Never dreamt to speak the phrase
But what the fuck just happened
You were the heart I owned
The beat just like a metronome
Can't breathe my heart is gone
Now what the fuck just happened
What just happened girl

I was always the one behind
You would run up and keep me in line
I looked up to you damn this hurts
All these years of discipline
Just to end up here at the end
Can you tell me what I've learned
What I've learned

We need to stay together girl
Hey
We need to stay together girl
Think about it

Chorus

2x
You were my friend
My friend 'til the end
You were my friend
Now what the fuck just happened

We need to stay together girl
Hey
We need to stay together girl
Think about it

Chorus
