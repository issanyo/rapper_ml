Brittany:
I know I may be young
But I've got feelings, too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying "Little girl don't step into the club"
Well, I'm just trying to find out why 'cause dancin's what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, oh (It just feels good)

Huh, huh, huh, huh

I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical, what the hell who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you dancing there, yeah

I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it

I'm a slave for you
I won't deny hide it
I'm not trying to hide it

Baby, don't you wanna dance upon me (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place?
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance upon me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age (Uh, uh, let's go)

Like that
You like it, yeah
Now watch me

Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, woah (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, oh (It just feels good)

Huh, huh, huh, huh

I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh, uh, uh)

Baby, don't you wanna dance upon me (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place?
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance upon me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age

I'm a slave for you (Take that now)
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it

I'm a slave for you (It just feels right, It just feels good)
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it

Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, oh

Huh, huh, huh, huh (Just dance with me)

Get it, get it, uh
Get it, get it, whoa
Get it, get it, oh

Huh, huh, huh, huh

I'm a slave for you (Here we go now, here we go now)
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it (Do you like it when I move?)

I'm a slave for you (Uhu, uhu, here we go)
I won't deny it (Yeah, yeah)
I'm not trying to hide it

Yeah, like that?
