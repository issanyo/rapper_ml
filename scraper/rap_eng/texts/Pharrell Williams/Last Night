[Verse 1]
I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you happy, girl?
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well, that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you

[Chorus]
For last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Verse 2]
In your eyes, Isee a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now, I'll wash my hands
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe
Pharrell say "Don't do it the same"
But I say ain't playing my games
But for you, my soul still remains
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you happy, girl?
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well, that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you

[Chorus]
For last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Remember girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you, you

[Chorus]
Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right

[Chorus]
Last night (Just-a last night)
Can't believe what I was hearing (Just can't believe it, baby)
Telling me to have a nice life (Oh)
So tonight (Yeah)
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'mma do for me what's right
(Got something I wanna tell ya, girl)

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you (Let me tell you one more time)

[Bridge]
I hope you're thinking (Tell me girl, when I was your man)
(My baby)
I hope it sinks in (If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Well, I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming (The way I feel)
About you

[Outro]
Oh, baby
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See, I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you
Remember girl when I was your man?
Ain't nothing gonna take that away
No, no, no, no, no, no-no
See, I remember
In December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby
