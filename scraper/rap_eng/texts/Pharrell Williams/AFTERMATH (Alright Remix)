[Intro: James The Monarch]
Yeah
Oh it ain't over motherfuckers
We bouta make the next fucking hit
Shit

[Verse 1: James The Monarch]
When am I gonna gonna make it to the floor seats
Poor me
Gotta shoot and steal to score and make more heat
So high  I can't see the street no more
So high my hands touching gods feet so more
Niggas put to the side like a deep cold sore
Oh sure
Switch ya flow more
So more
And slow more
Go forth
Go shore
Oh yours
And show more
Show the world
Your behind James like a closed door
(Fuck, Yo can we start it from the top real quick)
Said your behind James like a closed door
Sorry to say that this young snot nose more
Sorry to say
That your starting to play
So I'm sorry the spray
Is quickly heading your way
So I don't really care if your heads in the way
Cuz your paper kinda dry like you drawn a blank
And I'm starting the think
That it might be the ink
You passed my way cuz I'm starting to sync in
And link in into my thoughts
My minds not  together but connecting the dots
Really gathers thoughts
And I think of the yachts
And I think of who stopped me
Not me
I got me
Burning paper when I spark trees
Pans and pot steam is the only way they got me
Sheesh shit
Man can he spit
Coughing out lines it demand that he sick
Flow hurts the beat like van dam when it kicks
I ran the track hard and got banned from the shit
No forks I gotta use my hands for this shit
Canibal shit
I'm an animal bitch
And I'm handling shit
You couldn't handle this shit
If you and Kyrie Irving  were to swap handles and shit
I'm still a cavalier
I kill every single track ask my engineer
If you don't believe me call me like an auctioneer
I'm never selling out ain't no auction here
Watch his bars tho
They exceed caution here
Here's his tape
Nah I'm just joshin' queer
Get it hopping dear
Ain't no dropping here
So I'm stopping here
They too corny for the shit thats really poppin' here
Uh
[Verse 2: Nate The Product]
Auntie always saying I'm the leader of the pack
So don't in my face you better take a step back
Cuz its facts that I always wanna make dope tracks
Two singles wishing they could reach the top of the map
Killing shit tell me where the fucking 5-0 at
I don't get bad luck like a black cat passed
Sip soda just making it harder to fall flat
Can't fuck wit a girl unless that ass is fat
Hot damn I feel like J Cole in this bitch
Wet dreams only makes it harder and shit
Now lets make a switch
We rap to enrich
Fame ain't easy can't pull it out the fridge
Having fun on the track nigga thats how it is
Surprising all the people like a fucking pop quiz
I need one shot don't empty the clip
Going berserk when they flip the sitch
Feeling like a hero but I'm chilling like villain
6'3 big guy looking like godzillan
Godzillan ain't a word but I used it as a fill in
Been having good vibes why these haters tryna kill it
Day dream about the days I'm gonna be winning
But I been feeling like its hard to get the top of the inning
Ha thats a baseball reference
Thats best damn sport that I flex with
The endurance makes me feel so adventurous
I'm influenced by my mama she so generous
Like the rest of us
We finding trust without no fuss with my team you too dumb if you fuck wit us
Making moves about to dominate the stage
Change my ways but keep the differences the same
It's Nate The Product from the fucking 508
It's the fucking 508
Nigga
