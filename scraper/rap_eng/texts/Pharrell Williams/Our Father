[Intro]
Our Father, which art in heaven
I'm so grateful
Of all the beautiful things
That you are allowing me to see
The birds, the bees
The ability to do what I do
The opportunities
I know you love me, man
And I think it's time
And my duty, to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you, oh)

[Verse 1]
[?]
[?] on me, won't let me fall
You watch for who I'm friends with
I got tattoos, you forgive me
You know I'm so sensitve
You know I'm chased by women
You know my mind is driven
To you, my heart is given

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
They don't understand what you do for me (do for me)
And judging by my actions they don't know I believe (I believe)
Not talking 'bout what I wear, where I drive and where I sleep
I mean the ability to hear, feel and see

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Thank you for my brothers
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)
Thank you for my mother
So happy that she had me
For that I was shooting love
And hearts that's filled with hatred
Thank you for my power
It won't intoxicate me

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna teach the kids
There's more than meets the eye
And if they keep you first
Then [?] they can fly
I'm not saying that I'm the fruit
That [?]
But when I listen to you
I know I could truly see

[Chorus]
You're the greatest
You're the greatest (wow)
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)
You're the greatest, don't let me fall
