You be sitting on the sidelines
Nobody can trust me
I have no fucking clue why
Just skinned your knee (ouch)
Annoying ass act like a fruit fly
This shit should hurt
Trying to flex with a hanes sweatshirt (hanes)
My momma told me I should count my blessings
Cause you never know when they’ll leave
Life can be hard why you actin like it’s christmas eve (santa)
You got an ugly ass jumpshot like MKG
Look at my flow chart
Shows all my bands going up
Ya momma smell like a fart (tart)
Why you messy eating
When I come for you you’d be retreating
Hear me on the announcements like chuck
Might sound like Donald duck
Cooking up like I’m harden
You be sitting in the garden
I speak for the trees (lorax)
You just lost ya keys
Freaky like I’m greek
Livin in a creek
Dumbass looking like shrek
Wait a minute
This will only take a sec
Chillin during the movie
My chain made with a ruby
Juulin all night
Think I need a sprite
Pullin up in my rarri
You be feelin real sorry
Traveling all over the earth
You about to give birth
Why do you want clout
Make me want to doubt
You be actin crazy
Making me feel lazy
Choking you out like reggie
Stop being so edgy
Rocking the hottest sweats
You’re going to hear the sound of the jets
No Cap
You’d be running for the door
Might fall on the floor
220 pound machine is who I am
Don’t speak to me because you’d be counting it up by the gram
The people’s champ is who I’m referred to
You can’t look at me while you’d be lookin so blue
This shit over
No cap
