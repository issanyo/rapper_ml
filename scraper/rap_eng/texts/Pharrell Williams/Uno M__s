[Bridge: Pharrell]
I peeped what you goin' through, baby
You don't know, but it is in your eyes
I think you need a 180
Total opposite'll be nice  (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
It's my duty to help you snap back
Leave your worries long gone, long gone
Let go what you cannot take back
Take this moment and move on, move on
I was once like you, had me in my runnin' shoes
Thought of nothing I could do, man I had it wrong
Something up in my eyes, make my self-esteem rise
Then they told me that I needa' do a song

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
A twenty year career, I hope you understand
I used to pitch on the block, I did it underhand
They said I'd never make it, never be much
And I agreed wit' 'em, I ain't see such
So I celebrate life (life)
Vodka shots, this with ice (ice)
Baby we gon' drink more
At least one more, don't needa' think more

[Chorus: Pharrell & N.O.R.E]
Come have a drink with me, baby
Just fill, don't think with me, baby (just fill, don't think)
I'll be the shrink you need lately (haaa)
Just one more clink with me, baby (yo, yo)

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E]
I want to make money, I want to make more
She wanna' fly wings, she wanna' take off
She wanna eat lobster, she wanna drink wine
The realest dude in the world, that's how they rate slime!
You knew it was weird, they tried to fake you
Pay attention to love, who cares who hate you

[Refrain: Pharrell]
We'll win one way or the other, let's start now girl

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
It's my duty to help you snap back
Leave your worries long gone, long gone
Let go what you cannot take back
Take this moment and move on, move on
I was once like you, had me in my runnin' shoes
Thought of nothing I could do, man I had it wrong
Somethin' up in my eyes, make my self-esteem rise
Then they told me that I needa' do a song

[Chorus: Pharrell & N.O.R.E.]
Come have a drink with me, baby (have a drink with me)
Uno más, one more
Just fill, don't think with me, baby (one more, only one more)
Singin' like, uno más 'til we go
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E.]
She wanted one more, I wanted one more
Ignored the last call, got one more
We from the bottom, so we always celebratin' (what?)
From the bottom, so we always celebratin' (what?)
Can't help that
I wanna help that
I wanna save her life, I know she felt that
She in a good mood
And I agree wit' her
I just wanna get drunk and go be with her

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
It's my duty to help you snap back
Leave your worries long gone, long gone
Let go what you cannot take back
Take this moment and move on, move on
I was once like you, had me in my runnin' shoes
Thought of nothing I could do, man I had it wrong
Somethin' up in my eyes, make myself self-esteem rise
Then they told me that I needa' do a song

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Come have a drink with me, baby (uno más, one more)
Just fill, don't think with me, baby (uno más, then we go)
I'll be the shrink you need lately
Just one more clink with me, baby

[Outro: Pharrell & N.O.R.E.]
Uno más, one more
Uno más then we go
Uno más, one more
Whoo!
Geez Louise, papa cheeks
That was it
