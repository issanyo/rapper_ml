[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Oh...mmm...
Wha? Hehe..
Let's dance...again

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Don't sit there like some silly girl
If you wait too long, it'll be too late
I'm not tellin' you something new
There ain't no time to lose (no time to lose)
It's time for you to celebrate

[Refrain: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Get up, little girl
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, your world
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Your life, your choice
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
It's time, live it up

[Hook: Madonna & Pharrell Williams]
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You don't have the luxury of time
You have got to say what's on your mind
Your head lost in the stars, you'll never go far (no time to lose)
It's time for you to read the signs

[Refrain: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
I'll show, you how

[Hook: Madonna & Pharrell Williams]
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes
On and on, on the beat goes

[Bridge: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
Say what you like (say what you like)
Do what you feel (do what you feel)
You know exactly, who you are (you know exactly who you are)
The time is right now, you got to decide (Whoo!)
Stand in the back, or be the star (don't sit in the back)

[Refrain: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
(So get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Here comes, my hand
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
Take it, you can
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
The time, is now
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta your seat)
I'll show, you how
On and on...

[Bridge 2: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
I can't keep waiting for you (for you)
An-ti-ci-pating that you've
Nooo, time to looose (for you)
I can't keep waiting for you

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, here's an impromptu, I want you
I'm goin' to tell you what I want to - do to you
Your girlfriend, she wants to - beautiful
Just flew in from Paris - voulez-vous?
In the city that don't snooze
Smooze amongst the Who's Whos
And I use my celeb to get this one home
Why everything that feel so good gotta be so wrong?
Gimme room now, I'm like a vampire on the full moon now
And I don't know about you now
But I think I wanna try sumthin' new now
See what it do now
And when you sat down
Uh, 'cause you was losing yo' breath now
Uh, 'cause you be doing it to def now
She be doin E to F now, what's left now?
Mr. West now, can you get any more fresh now?
I think I just did, just now
Talkin' my shit, that's how
I'm a professio-nal, I admit that
Flashing Lights show, I live that
Fame is a drug, wanna hit that?
'Cause they know exactly where to get that - did you get that?

[Bridge: Kanye West, Madonna and Pharrell Williams]
(Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa yo' seat
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up offa yo' seat now)
On and on...
The beat goes, on and on...
('Cause they know exactly where to get that - did you get that?)
Let's go
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta yo' seat (the beat goes..)
Get down, beep beep, gotta get up outta yo' seat (the beat goes..)

[Outro: Madonna]
On and on...
The beat goes, on and on...
The beat goes, on and on...
On and on...
On and on...
