[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Yuh, it's 4am and you are up getting fucked up
And what a world it is all girls, I'm in luck
Say hello to your sisters and let's try some yoga
I'm yoda, it's cold, but let's get it poppin' like soda
One will make a bridge and two will make a pose up
One will do the down dog and I will be the cobra
It's NERD where the party is never sorry, no, illa
I take'em to the head, now to the bed, said the red gorilla

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Ooh I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down!
You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes, let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now!

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Look what you're doing, look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you
I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang; gorilla

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas](2703689)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
I'm like a anaconda in your garden
Baby girl, I'm explorin'
Deep down in your forest like
(Oooh oooh oooh aaah aaah aaah)
Hey, we got it hotter than an amazon
Gotcha cheetah bra with your heels on
And I'm about to be the king of your jungle like
(Oooh oooh oooh aaah aaah aaah)
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: R. Kelly]
Hey, it's like a rain forest, baby, how I got your love pouring down
And I'ma make that pussy growl
Cause what I got for ya, girl, I promise, it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang; gorilla

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me baby making love like gorillas](2703689)

[Bridge: Bruno Mars (& R. Kelly)]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you-you-you-you-you

I'm gonna be your gorilla
We'll be making love like gorillas
Baby, I'ma be your gorilla

Oh, you with me, baby

Yeaah, yeaah, yeaah, yeaah, yeaah
Baby, yeaah, baby, yeaah, aaww yeaah
