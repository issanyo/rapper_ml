[Hook]
He said stand in front of me
Let me palm that ass
Show 'em you're my girl
In MAC lipstick
I'll be the king
As long as you stand in front of me
In front of me
Stand in front of me

[Verse 1]
My life's become a fantasy
I wake up, you're my man
Give me the world like, "Here you go"
Just by grabbing my hand
What you are, it puzzles me
And I love when you say "Stand in front of me"
In front of me
Stand in front of me

[Pre-Hook]
I was asked something long ago
I couldn't answer
And it bothered me a little
How do you keep your man?
And I found the best answer is simple
You just do it, do it
Mean it
Prove it
That's how you keep your man
How you keep your man
How you keep your man
How you keep your man
Ladies do it, do it
Mean it
Prove it
Oh, you gotta have a plan
Gotta take a chance
That'll keep your man
That'll keep him saying

[Hook]
Stand in front of me
Let me palm that ass
Show 'em you're my girl
In MAC lipstick
I'll be the king
As long as you stand in front of me
In front of me
Stand in front of me
In front of me
Stand in front of me
In front of me

[Verse 2]
So I get down on bended knee
And grab you by your hand
You're like, "Oh no babe, you can't do that!"
I'm like, "Oh, yes I can!"
Or we can just go back to cuddling
Or you could just say
"Stand in front of me"
Stand in front of me
Front of me
Stand in front of me

[Pre-Hook]
I was asked something long ago

How you keep your man
How you keep your man
How you keep your man

That'll keep him saying

[Hook]
Stand in front of me

In front of me
Stand in front of me
In front of me

[Outro]
Mmm
Now I love when my man talk to me like that
