[Pharrell] Ho!

[Robin Thicke]
She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
The kind of girl you'd walk the whole Earth for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Break: Robin Thicke]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Robin Thicke]
Uhh.. she's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine
When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you, girl
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you

[Break: Robin Thicke]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Interlude: Robin Thicke]
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I'm so glad)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (I found you)
Wanna love you girl, wanna love you (oh girl!)
Wanna love you girl, ooo-ooh

[Pharrell Williams]
Uhh! Picture this all
Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life - and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore
With the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!
