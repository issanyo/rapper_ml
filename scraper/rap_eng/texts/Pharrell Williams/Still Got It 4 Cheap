[Verse 1: Pusha T]
This a warrior song, we two-stepping till the warrior's drawn
The flow rolls of this warrior's tongue
Ain't none slicker since the notorious one
When it come to this dope, blood, money, and guns
I'm something like a triple threat, power make her triple wet
The devil wears Prada, she loving that new triple six
Rather get head, or she can get lost
The bitch fell in love when she saw what the wrist cost
The price is right, putting numbers on your head
The price of life, you worth more than niggas dead
Shit get violent, the streets remain silent
You know the rules for talking, so niggas, you best mime it
I ain't made the rules, the codes, or the oath
Same when I ain't bring all that powder to the coast
I'm just playing my hand the way the cards dealt
And it's easy for the winner find peace within his self

[Chorus: Pharrell & Pusha T]
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap, niggas
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap, niggas
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap

[Verse 2: No Malice]
What we have here is far from fabrication
The doors are jawed, and the jaw is still amazing
Lines outside, single file formation
But nothing like the Carter, we are no relation
Hot penetration, you misbehave
I put something in your heart like you miss [?]
The wrist puff√©d and the whips pureed
Got the feds guessing like it's Charades
Gym star blades are the tell tale signs
Powder on the scale, read between the lines
Nothing by chance, this is all by design
Should a problem arise, it's resolved by the nine
They say the mind's a terrible thing to waste
I leave it on a dash with your lap and your face
Platinum mask artist, we laugh at your face
That 808 kick but you know nothing 'bout the bass

[Chorus: Pharrell & Pusha T]
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap, niggas
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap, niggas
We looking for the beige and the green and the diesel
Yeah, I still got it for cheap
