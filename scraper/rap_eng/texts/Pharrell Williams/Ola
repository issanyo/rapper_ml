This is Ras Moses
Dreadlocks, well before one Selassie words shall
Pass Zion and earth shall boom like ball
Tell me whey di hell a gwaan a dance hall

Inna 1957 wen tings just a settle down
When a near independence and Selassie never come
Outa back a wall a whey di bobo camp did settle down
Housing sheme did all a build up
Tings a bulldozer dung
Emmanuel mek a wall and a bull bay di man tun
Whey him build a di bobo camp and everyone was welcome
Outa Marcus Garvey a tun him eyes pon kingston
Whey him build di bobo camp and everyman was welcome
Bobo camp an institution for the old and yound for historical fact
Go deh go siddom
Forty three years of work everything overcome
Now emmanuel dead, everything tumble down
The hill divided in a three
Separated bu three sons
Middle sex, priest Donavan rule the daughters and the sons
Over surrey, priest Lennon a pure fire him bun
Priest mallard gone a prison fi nearly bun di hill dung
Right now a one million bobo deh a jamdown

[Chorus]
Sellasi seh before one a him word shall pass
Heaven and earth shall bun up like a ball
Tell mi whey di hell a gwaan a dance hall
Build more bridge and bruck dung all wall (repeat)

Who a di prophet fi Selassie army
Guardsman
Who start the dance hall business
Gueardsman
Who mek brigadier di general
Guardsman
So mi seh hail king Selassie and nuh exalt the flag
How some bwoy outta road a galang so bad
A more buff baff a cuss god
Mi siddown and mi wonda
Tell dat to the son and dem daughter
But mi sing alog

[Chorus]
All people whey know seh man affi free
And man nuffi go round and have bad mind fi other one
Rasta fi know dem fi live togedda
And fi organize and centralize
And know sey everyman will be strong in this time
So everyman waan stand up pon a next man foot
Why a next man cyan help a next man which is down
Meck mi tell yuh something man
If yuh bredda a say something wrong
An' yuh see day you can change him
It's up to you to teach him that he can learn
To say the right in three times
So let's cut out all the fight and bad mind living
And everyone sing

[Chorus]
