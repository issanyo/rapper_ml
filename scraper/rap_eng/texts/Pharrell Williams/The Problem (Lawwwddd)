[Hook: Pharrell]
The moment when you see that nigga face again
Replay it in your mind then your breathing change
He’s reaching in his jacket, he gon make it rain
The bystanders screaming lawwwdd
The DJ screaming lawwwdd
The AK screaming lawwwdd
Bless that nigga’s mama’s heart
Her baby stretched out on the boulevard

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Niggas tryin' to shit on me and make history
Supposedly I help chicks, help them with groceries
Supposedly I still break, gripping my rosary
Still shoot ya block up to make you notice me
(Lawwwdd) Bullets flyin in the air much
Fucking heard the guy hurt, I don’t even care much
(Lawwwdd) And I’m still smoking bogomill
Still have the street meeting, stop one broker deals
You my nigga nigga fuck how nigga Oprah feels
Papi, I pop guns, they don’t pop me
Known for shooting niggas, but nah, they never shot me
Hang hang good belt gang, don’t make us pop three

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Yeah, I hear you talking what year, nigga whatever nigga
You did time, me too nigga, whatever nigga
Pussy plus dick could only equal to fuck
NORE + Pharrell could only equal to what what what what
From blood money to love money to thug money
Nino what up? Fucking the oldest G’s money
I’ve shot niggas in they motherfucking peep holes
Winter time, shot niggas in they ski clothes
(Lawwwdd) still I stay focused still
Catch cases, got cases is open still
(Lawwwdd) slime father, slime out
Good belt gang hang hang, nigga ride out

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E.]
Neptune, cocker spaniel, underground, Ralph McDaniels
My dick, two can handle two chicks, tu Cumpleanos
Italian shit, The Soprano, I attack like I'm Rambo
I attack, I attack, counteract, cardiac
Shootin at yo Pontiac, wherever where your army at
(Lawwwdd) Moscato with the peach mix
(Lawwwdd) I'm just rollin with some freak chicks
(Lawwwdd) here the drinks come spiked, prefixed
