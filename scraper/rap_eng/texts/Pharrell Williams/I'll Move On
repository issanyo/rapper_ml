[Mario] (*echo*)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah
Bow Wow, Mario, ya'll ready

[Hook - Mario]
I'll move on
Hearing if I, knowing I like what's on the table
Looking at my life, doing what's right because I'm able
Learning lessons, more protected, feeling great'll
I'll move on
Hearing if I, knowing I like what's on the table
Looking at my life, doing what's right because I'm able
There's no turning back to see if anything's wrong
I'll move on

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Life goes on, as I roll on
I could only be a child for so long
Yeah I wanna see my childhood prolong
But this time Bow Wow say so long
And I step to a new day, new age, and a new page
In a book of life but it's looking like
Ya'll ain't ready for the new phase
Then I'm a get more mature
Make mistakes, but hey, everybody did that before
Ever feel like you've been trapped before?
Wish you can open up a magic door?
Step through it, just do it
The way that you feel it but ya'll confuse it
Ya'll wanna show that keep me secluded
But this is life I'm bound to go through it
It's a process ya'll gotta digest, let the boy grow up
Wanna go out, have a little fun, if it get a little wild, then so what
There's a ounce of experience, that's more than a pint of advice
I hope ya'll hearin this, cause I'm serious
And it's like, I'm so curious about life
I'm movin on

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I know you think you know what you think you know
But I'm different than anyone you've ever seen before
So don't compare me with other thirteen year olds
You seen lookin cute comin on the scene to blow
First impression of a young adolescent
A grown up mind, that flow so impressive
Grew up so fast in this profession
A flash of concerts and late night sessions
So much dough, he don't know it's a blessin
The way he brag, he gonna last one second
But oh contrare, don't stop and stare
If I sell my jewelry and cut my hair
Still be here after ya'll, standin tall
Like I ain't had a chance to ball
So when you doubt me, I'll just laugh at ya'll
Shad Moss fall in love, it ain't no plans at all
But ain't no tellin, when there's no more sellin
Another record end up, with a fail of a record, naw
But I still got actin and basketball
So if you ain't checkin for me, I ain't checkin for ya'll
So let this be a lesson to ya'll
When I rap, acted, played professional ball
No matter who you give that right to or who you listenin to
You get one life, ain't nobody live it but you

[Hook] - w/ ad libs

[Mario - singing]
Movin on, yeah (*echo*)
Movin on (*echo*)
Movin on, ready (*echo*)
I'm movin on, gotta move on
I will move on
Let me, yo move on
Yeah, gotta go now
Hit the road now
Me and yo now
Here we go noww, ohh

[Bow Wow]
Just playin around ya'll
Gotta go now ya'll

[Mario]
No, no, no, no, no {*repeated until fade*}
