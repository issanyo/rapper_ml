[Mystikal]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

[Pharrell]
You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

[Mystikal]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Hook]

No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping

Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Hook]

Oh you heard about it, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when its over and done with I hope you proud of me

[Hook]
