I’m so ambitions
When it comes to this rap thing all I want to do is kiss it
Like Jada no not Picket but like Jadakiss I kiss it
My tongue all down your throat giving you the business
And you ain't never been to America so you ain't never seen an American tongue like a French
It is what it is you can get with me or you can stay with them
You probably want Storm highly demanded and back by a popular demand
Build a fort and I can turn you on all day and I will never ever leave you alone
Just me myself and my microphone and nobody else lights on but no one home

The y say your first love now that’s the love that always  hurts
See he leave me for short shorts and miniskirts but him a f@#$ flirt
But you going to have to leave him alone
It’s more to our love than appearance you see the really love that’s the that innocent
But in a sense we are one the matrimony one dress dressed in all white I’m pure
Nothing to expensive no couture or Kimora Simmons get in where you fit in and that’s how we living
Told him put the beg in odds maker shake that money maker on a rumpa
I’m on a hiatus living that life no favors got no sense of the time flavor
Been rocking since the early 80’s poison brought my adidas shell toes
Now all day I dream about how good it would be to turn my mic on
