[Chorus]
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight

[Verse]
Ooh boy, what planet do you come from, boy?
Is it Neptune or Jupiter, boy?
Come and feel my loving boy
You know that you deserve it, boy
What planet do you come from, boy?
I know that we just met, oh boy
Come and feel my loving boy

[Chorus]
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight
You don't have to call
It's okay squirrel
Cause I will be alright tonight
