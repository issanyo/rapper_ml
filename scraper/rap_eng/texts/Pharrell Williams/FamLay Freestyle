[Verse: Fam-Lay]
It ain't nothin' y'all can teach me
I been locked up more times than Sweet Pea
See I'm from Norfolk here's a coffin if ya slee-py
Turn ya children into orphans tryna sneak me
Or tryna creep me, the realest shit I ever spoke
So I'ma spit it when I finish, I'mma slit my throat
This shit is like 211 mixed wit coke
Leave you spinning like the tennis balls in ya spoke, nigga
Dark secrets, man I won't lie
They came to the light a man is gon' die
All hope is lost and FamLay's gon' fry
Cause I did shit the average man just won't try
Like what? War against an army wit a hand gun
I'm FamLay, and when my fucking chance come
I'm running wit it, on e'ry song I'm coming wit' it
See some you think you can take from me, then come and get it
See I'm from Huntersville, e'ry thang we done is real
My niggas come in here, my niggas come to kill
And I dare y'all to try to dis us
See you in the streets it ain't nothing discuss
Maaan, we gon' stomp yo ass dead in the ground
FEW WEEKS, couple bodies wit no head'll be found, nigga
Cut off ya wrists, and they feet no prints (Gangsta)
Now I'm in the Six, (Gangsta) wit the heat no tints, you see me boy

[Outro: Pharrell]
