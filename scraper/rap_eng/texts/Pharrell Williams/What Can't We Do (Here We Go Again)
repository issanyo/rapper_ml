[Verse 1: Cris Cab]
Burstin' through your roof, coming through your wall
We all living proof, you can do it all
And if you gotta run, you better win the race
Before you learn to walk, you gotta hit your face
And then you get back up, and take a step again
Joys a piece of cake, when your not in pain
And if they say your young, that means you just go it
And if they challenge you, here we go again

[Chorus]
Ay, ay, here we go again, ay, ay, here we go again
Ay, ay, here we go again, ay, ay, here we go again
We are, Were young with our own directions
We work hard, for our parents protection
And so far, where the number 1 selection, not braggin'
You gotta problem then answer this question
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do

[Verse 2: Cris Cab]
No matter who you are, or you pretend to be
You gotta play your part, in our society
You've gotta find your way, sometimes you turn wrong
And it may set you back, throw your timing off
You can overcome and rise back to the top
Some people say it's lonely, trust me no it's not
They wanna see a show, they wanna see you win
Get yourself together, here we go again

[Chorus]
Ay, ay, here we go again, ay, ay, here we go again
Ay, ay, here we go again, ay, ay, here we go again
We are, Were young with our own directions
We work hard, for our parents protection
And so far, where the number 1 selection, not braggin'
You gotta problem then answer this question
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
[Daytona speaking:]
Ain't nothing we can't do if we put our minds to it
Whatever, Daytona, yeah!

[Daytona]
Generation X, next generation YX
Questions let the demonstrations escalate to crime
They estimate that I see death by 25
Overdose or homicide the result of my demise
That would help us both decide alive round here
While I write this verse for my nigga Barack downstairs
Wrapped tears in sorrow [?]
Stacking figures, packing pistols and ask for their survival
Wheres the bible when you need it, feel like prayer [?]
No money coming in, I need a pair of new sneakers
And my Doos jacked up like a need a few [?] back up
I've been alright, Make that bitch move like Jagger, who
And shit get ugly when your ribs touching
And Mitt Romney never did for me
Thats what you do, no need to views the news
Put your ears to the speaker and hear that Echo Boom

[Chorus]
We are, Were young with our own directions
We work hard, for our parents protection
And so far, where the number 1 selection, not braggin'
You gotta problem then answer this question
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
What can't we do, What can't we do
