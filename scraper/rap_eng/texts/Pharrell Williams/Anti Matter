[Intro]
Tilt your head back and close your eyes

[Chorus]
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk—)

[Verse 1]
Hey, what's this on your iPod? tell me what you listening to
Why you jumping 'bout his money? I ain't hear him mention you
I know this aggravate you, and it upset ya
But I can change you, I know how you hear me, is this better?
Yeah girl you like this, yeah, this your language
Life is short and black and white just like little penguins
Why you were in social studies screaming and argue?
Why you Doctor Kill Joy shooting up the party?
Where you get that money from? wait, where you running to?
Why I'm hearing sirens? where them blue lights coming to?
Dog, you a genius, you can blueprint and plan this
'Stead of playing video games, why don't you take advantage?

[Chorus]
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk—)

[Verse 2]
What's that on your iPod? tell me what you listening to
Why you jumping 'bout his bitches? I ain't hear 'em mention you
I know this aggravate ya, and it upset ya
I'ma change it, I know how you hear me, is this better?
I don't understand you, you the school's biggest cut up
Riding in your momma car, booming like a motherfucker
Why you always spitting for? what you get her digits for?
Don't you know with no money, that girl is not gon' give you none?
Life doesn't dish out, why you got your fist out?
Oh, you just gon' run in there and five finger discount?
Talking 'bout "Where the weed at?" wait, what you coughing for?
I thought you was an expert, now listen to the officer

[Chorus]
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk—)

[Bridge]
I know you're alive and there's a lantern lit inside
It's not just burning bright
It won't blow up in your face if you try
I know you try hard, but you gotta try harder
Now you got your light, you can find your way
You're a multitasker, you're doing things faster
Are you gon' let this God-given gift decay? Wait

[Chorus]
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk bitch)
You so anti, don't I matter? (What?)
You so, you so, you so anti, don't I matter? (You punk—)

[Outro]
Motherfucker, are you ADHD? ADHD? ADHD?
You jump around like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD
You catch the steel like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD
You fuck around like you ADHD, ADHD, ADHD
