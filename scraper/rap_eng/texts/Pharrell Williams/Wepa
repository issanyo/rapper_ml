Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!

Hey everybody, everybody's got a rhythm
That will make you wanna move it like they do in South Beach
Gotta watch the women when you see their body spinning
With the face, push the waist, like merengue in the streets

Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!

Love is the air

This is dedicated to los opromidos
They give so much love, that is in the air
They work all day, dance all night
So when tomorrow comes, they say hey who cares

Now the heat is on, cuz this beat is on
Now I feel the don, hey hey
Now the heat is on, cuz this beat is on
Now I feel the don, hey hey

Hey everybody, everybody's got a rhythm
That will make you wanna move it like they do in South Beach
Gotta watch the women when you see their body spinning
With the face, push the waist, like merengue in the streets

Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!

Start the party, what I came to do
I don't care with who
So how about you
Give up your worries, and advance the moves
Til the sun comes through, with the morning view

Now the heat is on, cuz this beat is on
Now I feel the don, hey hey

Now the heat is on, cuz this beat is on
Now I feel the don, hey hey

Hey everybody, everybody's got a rhythm
That will make you wanna move it like they do in South Beach
Gotta watch the women when you see their body spinning
With the face, push the waist, like merengue in the streets

Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!

Arre bote bote bote

Habia una chinita sentada en un cafe
Con sus dos zapatos blancos
Y las medias al reves

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hey everybody, everybody's got a rhythm
That will make you wanna move it like they do in South Beach
Gotta watch the women when you see their body spinning
With the face, push the waist, like merengue in the streets

Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
Wepa! Wepa! Wepa!
