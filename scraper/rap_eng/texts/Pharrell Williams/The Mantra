[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
In the way, minus sign niggas in the way
In the way, minus sign niggas in the way, yeah
In the way, minus sign niggas in the way, yeah
In the way, yeah, minus sign niggas in the way
But they will not get none, nah (Ear Drummers)
In the way, yeah, minus sign niggas in the way
Yeah, they will not get nothin' nah
In the way, yeah, minus sign niggas in the way
Repeat after me
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
It’s funny to watch them there attempt that blocking
But they will not get none, nah (In the way)
He's watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way)
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
The stars will keep fallin’, like asteroids we ballin'
So they will not get none, nah (In the way)
Watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way, hey)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
If it ain't a half a million in the face (In the face)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (In the way)
If it ain't a half a million when you race (When you race)
Far as I'm concerned, it’s in the way (It’s in the way)
If you good with good, not great (In the way) (Not great)
Far as I'm concerned, it’s in the way (Way)
No remote on the G5 Plane (5 plane)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (It's in the way)
You can’t fall back to sleep once you awake (Once you awake)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (In the way)
You ain't supposed to worry about it when you pray (When you pray)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (It's in the way)
If what you doin' don't help you elevate (Elevate)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (In the way)
If you don't share the culture, shouldn't play (When you play) (Way)
Far as I'm concerned, it's in the way (Hey, hey, hey)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
It's funny to watch them 'em there attempt that blocking
But they will not get none, nah (In the way, hey)
He's watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way)
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
The stars will keep fallin', like asteroids we ballin'
So they will not get none, nah (In the way)
Watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I was down, bad, then my life switched (Then my life switched)
What a crisis, my Black Seville with no license (No license)
I was lifeless, I was deadweight, I was triflin' (I was triflin')
Then my eye twitched, then my hand shook, and my fist balled
Then my right wrist took a risk for us
Saw lightning that made titans (I was triflin')
With a pitchfork, we ate yo' food then got bent more
With excitement, big wars on my neck piece
VVS be fightin', move fast like loose jazz
I gotta race the world and be vibrant
No plates on my scrape, yeah, that's mando
Massaging the handle left hand on the candle (Huh)
I'm too high profile to drive Lambo, that there is a scandal
That man grab a handful (Huh)
Never been loved (Easy), bet I pull up (Beep beep)
I got a thing for her, I wanna fuck (Freaky)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Easy)
I got a thing for her
I mean I get you niggas out the way right now today, you say so
Take the safe and doctor pay 'em aimin' 'fore the case closed
Operate, then meet the player move on then for escrow
Hol' up wait, since Section 8 that's on my day to day though
Man-Man don't shake hand, he pop shit (Out the way)
She stargaze out through the cosmic (Out the way)
Amped up, we blew out the metropolis (Out the way)
And I've been too involved, huh (Out the way)
And I got tens on call, huh (Out the way)
And you pretend you ball, huh
I'ma do this for my dawg, you need a life jacket
Throw you in the deep end, that's now my target practice
Never been love (Easy), bet I pull up (Beep beep)
I got a thing for her

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
Yeah, all that they talking, that is blessing blocking
So they will not get none, nah (In the way)
He's watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way)
They will not get none, nah (In the way)
That bulletproof aura, knowing God is for you
So they will get nothing off you, yeah (In the way) (Yeah)
Watchin' me (Minus sign niggas in the way)
