[Intro]
Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 1]
Listen
I see the man, they wanna touch ya
That's when I tell 'em, "Uh-uh"
I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another

[Refrain]
Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

[Verse 2]
I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say, "What's up?"
We both danced to "Lucky Star"
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
Ooh, you are that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

[Bridge]
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

[Chorus]
You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, more to gain
Gettin' higher, higher, higher

[Refrain]
Stress is cruel (stress is cruel)
Fame's a lie (fame's a lie)
But you're special (but you're special)
On every level (on every level)
Success is cool (success is cool)
And money is fine (money is fine)
But you're special (but you're special)
Another level (another level)

[Bridge]
Sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Ayy, sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Hey
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
It can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said, sugar, come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

[Chorus]
You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Ooh, higher, higher, higher
