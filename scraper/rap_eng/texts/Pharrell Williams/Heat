As soon as you hear the music play
Something happens you can't explain
And now you're thinking why
Why'd it happen that way

As you're dancing you look down and stare at your body
It's so confusing you sip on your drink
Now you're sweating like everyone else at the party
But ecstasy ends quicker than you think

Much hotter than what you're used to
Gotta let that conga move
Hot like the summers in Cuba
Baby girl, it's up to you

And the mist machines feel like rain
To cool the heat from salsa aches
Just let your spirit fly
It's hot so dance on, diablo

As you're dancing you look down and stare at your body
It's so confusing you sip on your drink
Now you're sweatin' like everyone else at the party
But ecstasy ends quicker than you think

Much hotter than what you're used to
Gotta let that conga move
Hot like the summers in Cuba
Baby girl, it's up to you

Come on now, chica, don't keep it bottled
Not for mañana AKA tomorrow
Come on, candela, uh, dejalo
Eres la estrella, tonight's your sueño
