(Verse)
This the realist shit I'll ever write (Yes sir)
Maybe cuz it's all I know (C'mon)
Life don't let you write twice (Yes sir)
One continuous note (C'mon)
The ink in my pen is life (Yes sir)
No erases though (C'mon)
Some people scribble across the lines (Yes sir)
Maybe that's why they go(C'mon)
Sick of being sublime (Yes sir)
I want the everydayers to know (C'mon)
Even though I'm of the third kind (Yes sir)
And this encounter is close (C'mon)
I'mma lay it down on the line (Yes sir)
Until I'm eternally a ghost (C'mon)
The opportunity is to dine (Yes sir)
So right now this taste like toast
(Hook)
Cause, I'm eating good (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
I'm in a good mood (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
(Verse)
Maybe I'm not good replying (Yes sir)
And maybe I'm not rocking' Gold ( C'mon)
But you ain't gonna see a nigga blind (Yes sir)
And You gon see a nigga hit his goal ( C'mon)
You gon see a brand new shine (Yes sir)
Watch how a nigga just stroll ( C'mon)
Life is surrounded by signs (Yes sir)
If your connected you'll know ( C'mon)
The unbeliever have a hard time (Yes sir)
Some say they find it difficult ( C'mon)
Nothing in their life ever rhymes (Yes sir)
And then they wonder why they never grow ( C'mon)
They rather grow like vines(Yes sir)
Six seconds and they go ( C'mon)
But I rather be a Bonsai (Yes sir)
Then never let the growth to blow ( C'mon)
And tell em
(Hook)
I'm eating good (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
I'm in a good mood (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down ((oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
(Verse)
Or-e-o that's what they call me
Sure to blow
But not them probably
Black on the outside
White in the middle
I want to feel love
I want to just giggle
About this world
The bullshit in front of it
Make a nigga just wanna get
Steamrolled (steamrolled)
Everybody say
Steamrolled ( steamrolled)
Oh man I'm
Rolling Rolling Rolling Rolling
I'm Rolling Rolling Rolling Rolling
I'm Rolling Rolling Rolling Rolling
I'm Rolling Rolling Rolling Rolling
I'm grinding I'm biting down
I'm grinden to lighten the sound
I'm grinden its tight now
And I'm shinning because I'm bright and loud
(Hook)
I'm eating good (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
I'm in a good mood (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
Can't bring me down (oh oh oh)
