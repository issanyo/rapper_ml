[Chorus: Santigold]
I don't know what they told you
I am soldier, baby
There's nobody I won't go through
Just to hold you, baby
I'm in the back of the rumble
Even the night now
I know what you like
Just won't deny it

[Hook: Santigold]
Bum bum, bum bum bum bum
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
I know what you like
Just won't deny

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
What's wrong with my reffing, oh?
What's that on your news channel?
All your beef has plans, I know
That is why we wear camo
Yes, we love are fans and so
Have some fun and shake and so
They don't know, they can't go
Next time when the speakers blow
Cross until they can't no mo'
Hop on stage and pass our show
We 'preciate you spending that dough
If you wanna hear a word from our intro
Interesting with your friend
We're your shit
We're my shit
Yes I rock my friends and so
This they know? (Uh, no)
You ask what I'm fighting?
You wanna know what I'm fighting?
On the radio, ain't exciting
On the TV, ain't exciting
Wanna what's behind and
Books I raise are dying
Wanna know, with the hope, you buying
Looks I'm out to frying
Screw you and your corp quarters
We taking your sons and daughters
It's time for social order
This is the social order
And now our loves are now shorter
Gotta jump inside the the water
Get that Miss Porter
Now turn off your camcorder

[Chorus: Santigold]
I don't know what they told you
I am soldier, baby
There's nobody I won't go through
Just to hold you, baby
I'm in the back of the rumble
Even the night now
I know what you like
Just won't deny it

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Every time you come see us
Show some love, the walls might bust
We go crazy cars might crush
Tell security (don't you cuss)
Kick the stairs and cop their teeth
From our stage to our roadie
If security comes and ask
"Where's your pass?" Say you're me
Flick off to whatever he says
Hop the fence and jump the stage
Make sure you're seen, make sure you're hurt
Snatch the mic and sing the words
If they kick you out the door
Turn around come back for more
If they won't let you in line say
"Fuck you, I had a great time"
You ask what I'm fighting?
You wanna what I'm fighting?
Club rhythm ain't exciting
Deuce giving em ain't exciting
Oh, it don't fit the timing
'Cause you always lying
Sometimes when we ain't whining
We do, we are trying
Screw you and your chauffeur
We taking your sons and daughters
It's time for social order
This is the social order
And now our loves are now shorter
Gotta jump inside the the water
Get that Miss Porter
Now turn on your camcorder

[Chorus: Santigold]
I don't know what they told you
I am soldier, baby
There's nobody I won't go through
Just to hold you, baby
I'm in the back of the rumble
Even the night now
I know what you like
Just won't deny it

[Hook: Santigold]
Bum bum, bum bum bum bum
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
I know what you like
Just won't deny

[Chorus: Santigold]
I don't know what they told you
I am soldier, baby
There's nobody I won't go through
Just to hold you, baby
I'm in the back of the rumble
Even the night now
I know what you like
Just won't deny it

[Hook: Santigold]
Bum bum, bum bum bum bum
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
Bum bum, bum bum bee-low
I know what you like
Just won't deny
I know what you like
Just won't deny it
