And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come
And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come

Lift your voices, pierce the sky
Come on boy, let your birds out
Lay them down
Hand in hand, side by side
Even when the rain is pouring down
There's room inside
It can hit the tidal waves
And all the stories they talk about
And it can whenever come these storms
Come the boat, we're going out

And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come
And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come

It can hit the tidal waves
And all the stories they talk about
And it can whenever come these storms
Come the boat, we're going out

And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come
And I'ma wait for, wait for the rain
It sure will come
Will have my faith, I know it's safe
It sure will come
