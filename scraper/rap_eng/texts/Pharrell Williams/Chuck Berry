[Intro]
See I can tell you need to get away
Won't you stand there and shake your place
Look!
Let me see your energy
Let me see your energy
Let me see your energy (oh, come on now)
Let me see your energy (hey)

[Chorus]
Do your move, uh
Chuck through the wind, uh
And do it all again, uh
(Ooh) Come on now
(Ooh) A-come on now
(Ooh) Come on now
Do your move (hey)
Chuck through the wind, a-come on now
Do it all again (oh, oh)
(Ooh) Come on now
(Ooh) A-come on now
(Ooh) Hey, let's go

[Verse 1]
I remember when I was a boy
Used to watch the old folks catch the joy
Would laugh so hard that we had to leave
Ooh, I gotta a baby now to help me see
You can feel what they see
But little did I know that the energy
Is the same thing as the energy

[Pre-Chorus]
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Move your body, let your body go
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Everybody, let your body go

[Chorus]
I feel so good, a-come on now
Chuck through the wind, uh
Do it all again
(Ooh) Come on now
Do your move (hey)
Chuck through the wind
Do it all again, do it all again now
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
(Ooh) Make the girls say
A-looka here

[Verse 2]
I remember when I was a boy
Used to think the old folks told us stories
I wouldnâ€™t believe what I could not see
I woke up and I was on my knee
Can feel what they can see
The darkness told me that I could not leave
Light broke the shackles and now I'm free

[Pre-Chorus]
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Move your body, let your body go
Some do not believe that you can
Feel the need within you but
We can prove it with the music
Everybody, let your body go

[Bridge]
One, two, three, now
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go go
Go go
One, two
One, two, three, four
Come on now
Come on now
