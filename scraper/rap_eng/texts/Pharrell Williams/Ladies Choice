"Yo. Wave your hands in the air if ya came to party. ("Party.")
Get down, baby, we get down. Neptunes, Most Wanted, baby. We get down
Come on. Wave your hands in the air if ya came to party. ("Party.")
Get down, baby, we get down. Neptunes, Most Wanted, baby. We get down."

[Boobonic]
Yo, yo, ayyo
Who prefer to gain cheddar, find D and Tim' better
Stay coppin' letters, take ya bitch if ya let her;
Clothes always sweaters, ain't nothin', I'm used to it
I rock shit up top and match boots to it
Major dough; ayyo, I'm fine and I'm able
Six wit' a roof like a dinin' room table:
All glass so I'm gettin' all ass
When y'all pass, see V-12's and haul ass
Oo-Bay, I oo-day what I oo-day
And don't care what a hater like you say
Itch-day, ude-day want a ey-hay?
O fle' like go away, that's what your daughter say
I got fans in Ja-Pan, got land
Block can't ice, hoes starin' like, 'Goddamn!'
B-A-double L-one E-one R
Two houses, one jeep, one car

To the sunlight
We can get down, baby, we get down
To the moonlight
Shake it, baby; shake it, baby
To the sunlight
Now bounce for me, baby; bounce-bounce for me, baby
To the moonight
I love the way that you do me, baby

[Mr. Man]
Check, yo
See, I tore up the game when I jumped out the range
Ice went bling from the watch to the chain
Chicks on the dick like, 'What's that nigga' name?'
I came here to bounce and to hollar at you, mami
All in her ear like, 'Who b'ought you here?
Wanna drink? Order two, I'mma be right there'
Grab the glass real modest and flash the Cardiere
Miss never seen a nigga like M-R-Dot
Who spit? Got jewels, man? I'm icy-hot
If you ball like me, shot-call like me?
You got a girl, playa, and me? Ya girl like me
I dance wit' her now and deal wit' hate later
Differenciate the playa from y'all haters
Reiterate the phrase again, 'Y'all haters'
Who got chips and don't gotta sip
Rollout wit' chicks, tell 'em hop in the whip

To the sunlight
We can get down, baby, we get down
To the moonlight
Now shake it, baby; shake it, baby
To the sunlight
Now bounce for me, baby; bounce-bounce for me, baby
To the moonight
Yo, I love the way that you do me, girl

There's something about you, boy, that makes me want to be with you
What you say, what you say?
There's something about you, boy, that makes me want to be with you
Come on, come on, yeah

[Boobonic
Mr. Man]
Yo, yo
We doin', show 'em what the game like
Wonder what the fame like?
Known for hittin' two to four chicks in the same night
Chicks can't tell me nothin', I got head
Niggas can't tell me nothin', I got bread
Niggas upset, I know. His ho wentchy
She throw them to his face, I got him by four inches
He real upset, mad and heartbroken
She told me not to pay him no mind and keep strokin'
Yo, can they fuck wit' us?
Uh-uh
Hit hoes wit' us?
Uh-uh
Rip shows wit' us?
Uh-uh
Get dough wit' us?
Uh-uh
Niggas upset and mad, I'm so fly-ie
Playa, get it right, I'm like that 'til I die-ie
Ayyo, see me at the bar wit' ice, blow they eye-ie
Say you got hoes like me? Nigga, ya lie-ie
Never be like us, nigga, but you can try-ie
Grease as she come on, ya chick cock ri-ide
