[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I too would have envied
If I lived above the water
I don't blame the sky for
Being so blue!
If you don't believe me
Just go and ask the humans
When they're down there swimming
With everything to do!

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (Shay Haley)]
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Spongebob, and it's not you!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
And Sandy Squirrel, it's not you!
Look at the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Hey booga-boo-hoo!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Krabby Patties will be cooked by who?

[Chorus]
And it goes eata-eata-edeo
It's creeping in your head and so
It's brainwashing the radio
That Patrick Star is king
Eata-eata-edeo
That rhymes with Spaghetti-O's
He's the king of
Bi-ki-ni Bottom

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I too would have envied
If I lived above the water
I guess that is why they-
Why they pollute!
To me that's a silly
Stupid concept when they
Wanna get away-
They wanna take a cruise!

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (Shay Haley)]
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Spongebob, and it's not you!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
And Sandy Squirrel, it's not you!
Look at the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Hey booga-boo-hoo!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Krabby Patties will be cooked by who?

[Chorus]
And it goes eata-eata-edeo
It's creeping in your head and so
It's brainwashing the radio
That Patrick Star is king
Eata-eata-edeo
That rhymes with Spaghetti-O's
He's the king of
Bi-ki-ni Bottom
