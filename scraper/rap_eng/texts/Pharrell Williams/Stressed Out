(Make your dreams come true)

[Verse 1]
You're so busy, worryin' 'bout
All of the thing you can to do nothing about
Maybe it's time to change your route
Instead of pluggin' in so much
You should look out
You have so many things to smile about
Like love

[Chorus]
For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out
So don't stress out (oh baby)
It will happen if it's meant to be
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby

[Verse 2]
We go 'round, mmm, only once
Don't waste you time not having fun
You should live your life, it's all you got
Like it's always better to live than not
You have so many things to smile about
Like love

[Chorus]
For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out
So don't stress out (don't stress out, baby)
It will happen if it's meant to be
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby

For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out (It could work out)
So don't stress out (oh don't, no, baby)
It will happen if it's meant to be
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby

[Bridge]
Laid back in my arms
Is where you belong
Sunshine will defeat the storm
At the end of the day, ooh

[Chorus]
For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out
So don't stress out (oh baby)
It will happen if it's meant to be
(if it's meant to be)
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby
(things could work out, baby)

For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out
So don't stress out (no no, don't stress out)
It will happen if it's meant to be
(if it's meant to be)
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby

No baby, ooh baby
All the things you've ever dreamed, it could work out
(So don't stress out) So don't stress out, baby
Ooh, if it's meant to be
(Things could work out, baby)
No no no no

For all the things you've ever dreamed
It could work out
So don't stress out
It will happen if it's meant to be
So don't stress out
Things could work out, baby
