[Refrain: Pharrell]
My love, ooo
My love

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
A winner never quits
And a quitter never wins
I thought about what I wanted
And you were on my list

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Remember where I was?
In the desert with no love
No cactuses, just dust
And you swept me from above

[Refrain: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
My Love

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good

[Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
Good morning, you got me feelin' (brand new)
You got me feelin' (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me

[Refrain: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
My love, ooo
My love

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Life to me is easy
People make it complicated
When love is the tool
No reason we can't make it

[Verse 4: Justin Timberlake]
Come on, let's go, be brave
Feel somethin' that they'll praise
Once we know that we're made
Then give it all the way

[Refrain: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
My love

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good

[Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
Good morning, you got me feelin' (brand new)
You got me feelin' (brand new)
[Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me

[Bridge: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake
All my life, when I describe
What I want, I've been misunderstood
The more I try, at bein' satisfied
And didn't think that I could
But then you came along, and you made me strong
Like God said you would

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
So I just wanna say
Thank you for this day
Cause it is so good

[Chorus: Pharrell and Justin Timberlake]
Good morning, you got me feelin' (brand new)
You got me feelin' (brand new)
[Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
Jumpin' 'round in your bag
So good morning, ooh girl
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
You are the feeling I'm jammin' to (brand new)
Like the tag's still on me
Got the tags still on me
