[Verse 1]
Hanging over my head my head
Problem after problem
When the problem love that
It's hard to get to the bottle
She said lay it low boy
No one take it slow boy
Way up and shore this we're driften the way
Be easy I know this world freezin'
My love keeps you breathin'
And you know what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
One thing, th-thing th-th-th-thing thing
When she comes around I can feel no pain
One thing, th-thing th-th-th-thing thing
And if you ever meet her then you know what I'm sayin

[Verse 2]
I could feel the answers when I'm laying in the arm
She led my whole life and when she touch my palm
She say lay it low boy
No one take it slow boy
Way up and shore this we're driften the way
Be easy I know this world freezin'
My love keeps you breathin'
And you know what I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
One thing, th-thing th-th-th-thing thing
When she comes around I can feel no pain
One thing, th-thing th-th-th-thing thing
And if you ever meet her then you know what I'm sayin

So I really need you girl
Come into my world
Let me off, let me off, let me off, let me off
Every time we get close I can let it all
Let me off, let me off, let me off, let me off
Take em higher girl
Uh take me higher
'Cause everything that you do
Makes me fall in love with you
Let me off, let me off, let me off, let me off

[Bridge]
So fire
Undeniable girl
Never gonna let you go
For the first time girl I'm happy inside
Never gonna let you go
Draw my line in this endless time
Never gonna let you go
You know you're my thang, got me feelin' so fine

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So I really need you girl
Come into my world
When she comes around I can feel no pain
Every time we get close I can let it all
If you ever meet her you know you insane
