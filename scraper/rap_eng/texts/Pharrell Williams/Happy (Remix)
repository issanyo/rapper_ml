Verse 1:
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine, she's here. You can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that can go to space
With the air like I don't care, baby, by the way

Chorus:
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know that that's what you're going to do

Verse 2:
Here come bad news talking this and that
(Overworked, underpaid, over stressed, do you understand?)
Give me all you got, don't hold it back
(Life gets hard, but with God in my plans, I'll be in His hands)
I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine
(Making moves with my view up above and the love around)
No offense to you, don't waste your time
(Because mine is assigned to the Divine. Now let joy abound)

Verse 3:
I'm just looking on the bright side
Cause with G-O-D it's the right side
Breath in my lungs for a message fresh on my tongue
On beats where I get to have fun
Providing my sustenance, shelter from thunder and lightning
Enlightening my mind when His words I'm reciting
Reminding that minding the spirit providing my lyrics
Is coming from my prayer's hearer
Blessings on Blessing
Came after stressing on lessons
That I'd try to bear alone. He said "Take my yoke."
Now I don't struggle until 6 with my woes
That load ain't a burden on me
Living life with no worry only
Following the Word on beats
That's where I drop verses homie
I'm happy and I know it
I ain't afraid to show it
These simple words from a poet
Couldn't be anymore potent
Cause when the going's tough, the tough get going
To the helping hand open
The Almighty Hand's what I'm holding
I know I'm happy
