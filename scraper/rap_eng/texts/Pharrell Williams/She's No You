[Verse 1]
They got a lotta girls who know they got it going on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see that you're the only one I really want?
And everything I need is everything you do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Any girl walk by, don't matter cause your looking so much better
Don't ever need to get caught up in jealousy
She could be a super-model every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever mean a thing to me

[Chorus]
She's no you (oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

[Verse 2]
They got a lot of girls who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do, the way you move
You're more than beautiful and I just wanna let you know
That all I ever need is what I've got with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Any girl walk by, don't matter every time your looking better
I think your perfect, there ain't nothing I would change
She could be a super-model every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever take my heart away

[Chorus]
She's no you (oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you

[Bridge]
No one's ever gonna get to me
Oh, the way you do, now baby can't you see
That you're the one, the only one
Who's ever made me feel this way?
Nothing's ever coming even close, no
No one's ever been comparable to you

[Breakdown]
I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you're given me
Don't stop anything you do
You're all that, all that and then some
You know what, just what I need
And no girl, no place and nowhere
Would mean a thing to me

[Chorus]
She's no you (oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
She's no you (oh no)
You give me more than I could ever want
She's no you
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl that I've ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
