[Chorus]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the—All the girls standing in the
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, you know, it's been a minute since, um
We expressed ourselves
It takes a lot of courage to say this, but um
I see sounds

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
You and your girls are going out tonight
Y'all been planning this all week right
You got something boys can’t deny (Here’s a hint)
It's like apple pie
Cut you open and you're just white
You ain’t tired; you wanna cause a riot
Who can say no to you?
Wait 'til they get a load of you

[Pre-Hook]
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
Because

[Hook]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

[Verse 2]
Superstar ask you what you have
Bartender get the drank we just laugh
"He talking 'bout a autograph"
You just wanna dance in your reckless path
Close your eyes, see colorful things, you wanna
Let go, feel wonderful things
Just a bit more just to get in the lane
So we can enter the brain and you can flip with the pain

[Pre-Hook]
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
Because

[Hook]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

[Bridge]
Baby, you partied all night in sixth gear
Just so you know the AC is blowin' over here
Don't worry, I won’t blow your high
Talkin' bout your life
And how it is all wrong
Just know if you go outside and see the sunrise as all the stars are gone
Tell your friends they can go, you’re okay
You’re just chilling with me
Here’s a towel, wipe your face, cool down
Have a drink, it’s on me

Here's a towel (Here's a towel)
Wipe your face (Wipe your face)!
Cool it down (Cool it down)
Have a drink, it's on me
Here's a towel (Here's a towel)
Wipe your face (Wipe your face)
Cool it down (Cool it down)
But you would rather party, cause

[Hook]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
