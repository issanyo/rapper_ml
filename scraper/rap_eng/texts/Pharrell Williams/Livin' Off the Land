[Intro]
You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is
There's you and nature
Soon as you think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson
As I'm alone in the forest, I'm one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude
I'll be a mountain main 'til the day I die

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & (Timberland)]
(Living off the land)
And I break my back
And I work all night
At times I do all their work too
It don't break my stride
I just keep moving forward
At times I wish there were two
So I have somebody else that could help me help you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you don’t get on your knees, and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Why you waste what you ain't got
On that power ball
Has it not quite dawned on you, that don't work at all
See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing for you
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you don’t get on your knees, and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave
If you don’t get on your knees, and repay the money you spent
But like her trust, you're gamblin' it
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Post-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Living off the land
Living off the land

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
If you just open up yourself (If you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself (If you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself (If you just open up yourself)
You'll see, got what you need
When you're living off the land
