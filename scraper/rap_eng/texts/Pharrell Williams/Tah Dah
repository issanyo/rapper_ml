[Verse 1]
It's getting harder and harder to bear
You got me acting like a clown in a collar
You got me spending all the time I can spare
You got me wasting every dime, every dollar

[Pre-Chorus]
When I stumble and fall
Does it hurt you at all?
Will it twist like a knife
For the rest of your life?

[Chorus]
You think that love's a joke
But there ain't too much to laugh at
And it's all for show
Should I keep my ticket after
Or should I just go
When you're begging for attention
Once the crowd goes home
And there's no one left to listen
Tah-dah!

[Verse 2]
You got me jumping through a circle of fire
You got me juggling everything that I care for
In your world it's like a cage with a tiger
That's what the cuts and all the bruises are there for

[Pre-Chorus]
When I stumble and fall
Does it hurt you at all?
Will it twist like a knife?
For the rest of your life?

[Chorus]
You think that love's a joke
But there ain't too much to laugh at
And it's all for show
Should I keep my ticket after
Or should I just go?
When you're begging for attention
Once the crowd goes home
And there's no one left to listen

[Bridge]
I've got the freedom to love
I've got the freedom to leave
Well now, enough is enough
I'm not a trick up your sleeve
I'm not a part of your show
Can't make me pop up and go
One day your curtain will close
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know

[Chorus]
You think that love's a joke
But there ain't too much to laugh at
And it's all for show
Should I keep my ticket after
Or should I just go
When you're begging for attention
Once the crowd goes home
And there's no one left to listen
Tah-dah!
