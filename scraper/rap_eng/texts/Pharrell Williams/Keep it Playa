[Intro - Slim Thug & (Pharrell)]
Say P, man the other day foolin' at the club
Mane with this broad or whateva
I walk in see her talkin' talkin' to some dude or whatever
You know what I'm sayin, so I holla at her I say
"Ay man check this out, man I seen you over there
Hollin at ol' boy, I ain't hatin on that
You know what I'm sayin, but I got a friend coming through too
So when you see her, don't trip, you know what I'm sayin
Keep it playa man, you know what I'm sayin"
So my broad show up or whatever man (word)
This girl wanna try and take a swing at her man (turn that shit up)
(That ain't right, this my man favorite record right here)
(Haha, yessir, beat that shit)

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
Before you say, it's cheaper to keep her, we consider and read her
Man she might be the type that won't pea you the feeder
She wants a little cheeba, a little margarita
Man them draws coming off, when she see the two-seater
So put your Porsche up, get your divorce up
I'm sure she'll sign it when she see me pull my doors up
Man them mansions on the water, motherfuck a hill
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The truck is steel, hoping somethin' between ya
And now she laughing how she took your ass to the cleaners
Man I'm on your side, not trying to inconvenience ya
Just now we get them million keys, and them plastic Ninas
So keep it playa dog, don't make me say it all
Do something drastic, know that plastic's everywhere dog
If it ain't music, all this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that mean she doesn't weigh it all

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Or you could scram cock sucker, if you'se a hater mayne
I keep them ladies going
Uh, uh, uh (uh)
Uh, uh, uh (haha)
Uh, uh, uh (yup)
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2 - Slim Thug]
I'm a grown man, Thug ain't the one that play no games witchu
Thug the one to call, to come get off the chain witchu
And hang witchu, when you full of Patr√≥n
And oh yeah, brain wanna get two partners alone (that's right)
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
Got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up, and gotta pick which car I'mma drive
The Double R 760, or the 645
I'm, having things mayne check out the chain
Money ain't never been a thing, you see the watch and the ring
Rocks the nicest, never seen none like this
I'm aboss, I don't ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just, get the share this shine
Long as you not selfish, and learn to share some times
And of course I'm still yours, and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater mayne, gotta keep it playa mayne

[Hook]
Now we can both post sip, and keep it playa mayne (yup)
Now we can both pull the misses, keep it playa mayne (uh huh)
Or we could both right our wrists, and keep it playa mayne (yup)

[Verse 3 - Pharrell]
You don't stop, they say J.Lo just to show her ass and all
Knowing the worst thing could happen, is a nigga could palm
Now my agent saying the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil' on each song, like my name was LeBron
What, not the ice, my beats is worth more
The track is like a whole damn Jacob Store
See niggas hate you more, when they take they broad
But his girl looked at my hands, seen a "Matrix" door
Dudes is foolish, the hues is the truest
I mean the smurfs look green, the rocks are so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask Me-Me
I think and relay it (uh), I blink and PJ it (uh)
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and e-Bay it
And all you Phantom owners know you can't stand me
Got one in Virgina, 'nother one in Miami, yessir
