[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you tell?
Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail
Lean out the window, that's when I yell
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself
Police wanna get him and put him in jail
I'mma do whatever to get him his bail
Hooked on donuts and rooster-tails

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, riding high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, can't you see?
Riding 'round your backyard, who could it be?
Pulling out the steering wheel right from the seat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
Pumping his breaks to the sound of the beat
He don't understand what he's doing to me
Deep down inside, like a pitbull in heat
Someone's coming, so we head for the streets

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, riding high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
It's twelve o'clock and I don't wanna party
My big boyfriend and my big truck hobby
A little bit of dirt never hurt nobody
Now I got dirt all over my body
Might as well lie to L
His big fog lights is bright as hell
Calls it off, he starts to yell
He hits the gas so I grab the rail

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Sure you wanna ride with me?
If you scared, don't lie to me
I'm a crazy motherfucker from the Midwest
With a Mississippi flow and an Arch rest
Four by four with the altar steps
We doing donuts underneath the arch, yes!
I need a chick on time, don't mind being early
A ride-or-die, dollar six thirty
A straight-up chick like twelve o'clock
"I don't know where he at", that's what she tell the cops
Take a stand for a nigga, raise a hand for a nigga
"I solemnly swear he was with me all day"
To the judge, "he the one I love"
Hell they could tell, she don't even budge
'Round and 'round we go
Don't stop 'til I tell you so

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm in that passenger seat, flying high in the air
And we're driving fast 'til we plumb out of gas, let's go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Round and 'round and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go
'Round and 'round and away we go
And away we go and away we go
Four by four and away we go
High not low and away we go

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
I'm a female rebel, who can't you tell, who can't you tell
Who can't you tell?
