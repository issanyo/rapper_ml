I:
Baby, this is our song
Tell 'em turn it up when they throw it on
Watch the world sing along
Look at what we got 'em on, babe
I always knew you were the one
I know they hear us in the club
I hear where you coming from
Ooh, baby
We be going up

Pre-chorus:And when you're gone
I know that it won't be long, nah-nah, 'til you come running
Baby, it's on
Soon as the music come on, oh yeah
You feel close to me

Chorus:
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away

II:
Baby, this is us now (us now)
At the hotel looking like a dream house (dream house)
In the back, on the couch
I'm only nineteen, but I'm still in this thing, oh (thing, oh)
You and I showing off (showing off)
Getting money, spending time, going out (going out)
Got me thinking that's what life about (that's what life about)
We the soundtrack, turn me up

Pre-chorus:
So, now when you're gone
I know that it won't be long, nah-nah, 'til you come running
Baby, it's on
Soon as the music come on, aw yeah
You feel close to me

Chorus:
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away

III:
I'm the only one, (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one, (I'm the only one)
I'm the only one, (only one)
I'm the only one, (ooh)
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, (yeah, yeah)
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, (ooh, yeah)

Pre-chorus;
So, now when you're gone
I know that it won't be long, nah-nah, 'til you come running
Baby, it's on
Soon as the music come on, aw yeah
You feel close to me

Chorus:
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
I'm only one song away
