[Hook X12]
What I need, what I need is that girl there

[Over repeat]
Get up!
Your dreams have now been fulfilled
C'mon~! Uhh... get up!
Let's go

[Pharrell]
Hey, hey, what do you think?
It's gettin right time, where your drink?
Hey, oh, 'fore the place blow
Make up your mind girl, c'mon

[Interlude]
Let's just GO!
You can bring your friends girl - let's just GO!
Forget about the type - let's just GO!
Don't worry 'bout the mornin - let's just GO!
Just worry about tonight

[Over repeat]

[Hook X8]
What I need, what I need is that girl there

[T.I.]
Ay, fly to any nigga, get a skinny mini
Hit her on a shot of Remy, promise she don't get a penny
What the bid'ness, let my homies slide up in it when I'm finished
The #1 pussy popper, f'real it's not just an image
Like tennis get served while she licks her
All I need's that girl right thurr, listen hurr
She playin under her dress, soakin wet, no fur
Who one-oh-one sex? Not me, no sir

[Hook X8]


[Over repeat]
Do you like it?

Party, party, p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p
