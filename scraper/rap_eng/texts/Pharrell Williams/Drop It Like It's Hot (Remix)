Spin around ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spendin money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around mommy
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm
And I'm pourin saun dan
And I roll the best weed
Cause I got it goin on

[Verse: 1 - Pharrell]
No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratchin, my niggas is itchen
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"
Yes, nigga, P stands for polish
None of y'all is fuckin with he, and this is obvious
I'm Ron Artest, layin down to your garbage
While my niggas in the street pushin shit like Ben Wallace
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands
These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man
I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio
Everything is grand? Nothing is poquito
Securitys behind me, with the torpedo
Cause the wrist stay frigid
How you say it? Frio
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill
And the ends also quarter million for each whe-el

[Verse 2 - Jay-Z]
I got haters on my jiz-ock, plus the fricking ciz-ops
All of whom want to hit me with shiz-ots til I dri-zop
Thank God for hip hop, or I be in the bizz-ox, uh
Jail or casket, either way you rizz-ock
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a ziplock
Mr S. D-izz-ot, it's not gon' stizz-op
Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past
Too cool for ciz-ops to cuff his iz-ass
Snitch-ass they made, they can't get the boy
These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store
Running to the DA, tryna get me for it
All the money it made, I'm like "Forget the law"
I'm not 'fr-iz-aid, it J-iz-ay homie you got pl-iz-ayed
Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the stiz-age (go sit down)
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S. Dot, tell ya lawyer
"Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot!"

[Verse 3 - Snoop Dogg]
((World Wide))
International, nah I'm universal
But you a gangsta, how you get to do commertials?
With them big wheels, yeah cuz you do it big
I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk
They want beef? Yeah cuz, pop the trunk
We go all the way, we do it lifesize
Now my life right, cause my wife on my right side
Yeah, and she protecting my interest
Now I'm on the move they got me hoppin' these fences
Ay little homie your defence is defencless
A pimp apprentice
Now come here princess (Come here, come here)
I know ya tired of the chit-chatter
It really don't matta it's like a seesaw platter
I check money, check niggas, check bitches
Now drop it like you ass on swit-ches [Ziip]
