[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I picked up the paper and the headline reads
It says, "Single broken heart in some satin sheets"
And I'm like why? We had a hell of a time

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped, oh it's your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but see if it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You see the mama called me to release steam
She said, "My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep
She just cries 'cause you're in her mind"

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped, oh it's your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but see if it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Get down to the floor, go shawty
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, hell yeah
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, go shawty
Feel the beat, get down to the floor, hell yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah
Feel it all over your body, yeah

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
If you just keep it in stride you should be all right
And if you take what's inside and mix that with pride
Instead, running along, keeping it going when you call
Girl, tell me why

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped, oh it's your heart

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but see if it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but see if it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right
Shawty is
