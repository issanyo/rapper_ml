[Chorus]
Well, I could be your doctor
And I could be your nurse
I think I see the problem
It's only gon' get worse
The medicine she gave you
Well, that will never work
I need to rub you, baby
Before your body bursts

[Post-Chorus]
Let me work it out
Let me work it out, yeah
Let me work it out
Wanna work it out? Yeah

[Verse 1]
You're my lover
I give you everything
Somehow we turned up
We turned up lovers lame?
Let bygones be bygones
Forget what she has said
You're my lover
That makes you mine to claim

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel like working it out, yeah
Baby, if you want to
'Cause I feel like working it out
Besides, what she's gon' do?

[Chorus]
Well, I could be your doctor
And I could be your nurse
I think I see the problem
It's only gon' get worse
The medicine she gave you
Well, that will never work
I need to rub you, baby
Before your body bursts

[Post-Chorus]
Let me work it out
Let me work it out, yeah
Let me work it out
Wanna work it out, yeah

[Verse 2]
You're my lover
I say no to nothing
I got that cover
Honey, she didn't bring
Let bygones be bygones
I know that you have changed
You're my lover
No reason to explain

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel like working it out, yeah
Baby, if you want to
'Cause I feel like working it out
Besides, what she's gon' do?

[Chorus]
Well, I could be your doctor
And I could be your nurse
I think I see the problem
It's only gon' get worse
The medicine she gave you
Well, that will never work
I need to rub you, baby
Before your body bursts

[Post-Chorus]
Let me work it ou. (let me work it out)
Let me work it out, yeah
Let me work it out
Wanna work it out? (wanna work it out?), yeah

[Bridge]
Are you on the fence?
Don't waste my damn time
Are you on the fence?
Get on the right side
Are you on the fence?
Before I let it slide
Oh yes, the grass is greener
It gets greener all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I feel like working it out
Baby, if you want to (if you want to)
'Cause I feel like working it out
Besides, what she's gon' do?

[Chorus]
I could be your doctor
And I could be your nurse
I think I see the problem
It's only gon' get worse
The medicine she gave you
Well, that will never work
I need to rub you, baby
Before your body bursts

[Post-Chorus]
Let me work it out
Let me work it out, yeah
Let me work it out (let me work it out)
Wanna work it out? (wanna work it out?), yeah
