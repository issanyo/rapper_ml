Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir

[Verse 1]
Ayo, let me enlight y'all
Let me spark this shit
We amongst the [?] sippers and the kush crumblers
The [?] distributors and coca tumblers
We shut down the club in amazement for those that are under us
The go pro bitches, they wanna run with us
Wanna blow me slowly, speed it up, fuck it, just run with us
Wanna have fun with us, not [?]
Cause when the [?] pour up, nigga park yo' whip
Spectators be yapping on some Bob Costor shit
I ain't just talking shit, I'm Marcus Vick
Without the Heisman Trophy but with the Hawaiian Sophies
Frequent Flyer Miles, I be flying, them hoes be
The chain tucked your sight cause you eyeing it grossly
Reach is a toothbrush, the iron is close we
Keep me surrounded so please don't try it
That poor dumb thing, no time to decide it
Unless you wanna be in the papers, and you headlining
Your whole fucking name followed by 'he dying'
If that was your food for thought you should go on a diet
I just fried it

[Hook]
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir

[Verse 2]
I just arrived at a five star hotel out in Atlanta
Speeding away from a van filled with bitches with cameras
The flash hits my ear, blinds 'em all with the gamma
Me and a stripper, she got a bubble and that cute Southern grammar
You know the type, probably stripped from Texas to Tampa
Waiting in the line, telling you it was for college or pampers
But I go through drastic measures not to ask as pleasure
I trade the gas and breakfast for the ass and the headers
Then top in the morning to ya, now she gotta zoom home
She gotta dance all night until the moon's gone
We head to Magic City, gotta hit a new zone
All you see is [?], silent colors, two tones
On your life nigga, nothing but tombstones
Some many phantoms the parking lot look like a graveyard
It's the domain where errbody play God
The under[?] is king, order remote by the card
Throw 20 grand up whenever Jeezy says 'yeah'
Give a new meaning to the phrase 'there's money in the air'

[Hook]
Yeah I was there, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
Yup, yup, yessir
