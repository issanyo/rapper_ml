Hey you, don't you give up
It's not so bad
There's still the chance for us
Hey you, just be yourself
Don't be so shy
There's reasons why it's hard

[Chorus 1]
Keep it together, you'll make it alright
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, what ending would we do?
This could be good, hey you

Hey you, open your heart
It's not so strange
Youâ€™ve got to change this time
Hey you, remember this
None of it's real including the way you feel

[Chorus 1 - Variation]
Keep it together, we'll make it alright
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

Save your soul, little sister
Save your soul, little brother
Hey you, save yourself
Don't rely on anyone else

[Chorus 2]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first

Hey you, there on the fence
You've got a choice
One day it will make sense
Hey you, first love yourself
Or if you can't
Try to love someone else

[Chorus 1 - Variation]
Keep it together, we'll make it alright
Our celebration is going on tonight
Poets and prophets, will envy what we do
This could be good, hey you

[Chorus 2]
First love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first love yourself
Then you can love someone else
If you can change someone else
Then you have saved someone else
But you must first
