[Intro]
First floor (ah)
Room sixteen (ah)
Smells like danger (let's go)
Even better (let's go)
Set your goals (ah)
Bless our souls (ah)
I'm in trouble (yes, I know)
But it feels like heaven, hey!

[Verse 1]
You were like one of those guys
The kind with the wandering eyes
But I said "Hey, what the hell?
Once in my life, I'll take a ride on the wild side"
You were so full of yourself
But damn, were you cute as well
You liked my legs, I liked your moves
Anyone could tell, not hard to deny that

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Interlude]
Second night (ah), in a row (ah), back in trouble (let's go)
I don't get it (let's go)
Gotta keep it down (ah)
'Cause the lobby called (ah)
But we ignore them (yes, I know)
'Cause it's getting better, hey!

[Verse 2]
When it comes to men it's known
That I end up choosing wrong
'Cause I always trip and fall
On the same old rock and repeat and go back
How blind a girl can be
To miss you hide your ring
Lied about everything
I'm so naive and I should have known that

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive
It may seem to you that I am in a place
Where I'm losing the direction of my life
But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive

[Chorus]
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
But it felt so right, I can't believe it
And all the mistakes that went on for too long
Wish there was a way I could delete them
Did it again now, I got it all wrong
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
Eh, eh, eh, eh, ah, ah, ah, ah
