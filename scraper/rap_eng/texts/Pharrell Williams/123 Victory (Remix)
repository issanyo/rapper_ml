Good people good people good, you know what I'm saying?
We will rise up from the ashes
Our children will have visions and dream dreams
And we will reap (Yeah) whatever we're sewn (Yeah)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Heyo 1, 2, 3
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, prosper
Heyo 1, 2, 3 (2, 3)
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me (yeah, you know it)
You know it won't prosper, prosper

[Verse 1]
Thought I gave up but I'm still good
You can keep your love cause I'm still good
Keep looking above cause He's still good
He's still good, I'm still good
Try to push me down but I'm still good
I never hit the ground so I'm still good
Cause the King wants the crown, y'all
I'm still good, He's still good, God is good

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People, calm down, down
Try to keep you down, down, down
You know they wanna keep us down, down, down
But long as we are down
Long as me and you are down, down, down
Then they can never keep us down, down, down
Take all the [?] down, down, down
So they will never prosper

[Chorus]
Heyo 1, 2, 3
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, prosper
Heyo 1, 2, 3
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, prosper

[Verse 2]
I know it's gonna take a minute to be good
It ain't easy how we living, we're still good
But as long as good is in it, we're so good
It's all good, so good, it's all good, so good
God is good

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People, calm down, down
You know they wanna keep you down, down, down
They keep tryna push us down, down, down
But they will never keep us d-d-d-d-d-d-down
We don't have to be down, down, down
As long as me and you are down, down, down
Take all the [?] down, down, down
Because of that, the'll never prosper

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Church
Now when will we see we are one?
We're all descendants of the Son
Waiting for the Master to come
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
No matter what your problems weigh
It's all very small in His face
When stretch out His hands, will you say
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Heyo 1, 2, 3
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, prosper
Heyo 1, 2, 3
Get up, we got victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, prosper
