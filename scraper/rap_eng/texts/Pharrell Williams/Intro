[Intro]
"N...E...R...D...
This..is... *In...Search...Of...*"

[Pharrell Williams]
Hey
It's me, your subconscious speaking
Turn me up yo
Close your eyes
Now that I got you under my concentration
Let's pledge allegience
We are the rare
We are the strong
We are the meek
We're just not humble about it
We've been here since the beginning of time
And all products of the world in which we live in
Are products of our imagination
We are the dreamers
And as long as we dream, we will never die
You know why?
Cause no one ever really dies

[Outro]
Hey, baby
Me, Chad, and Shae
We want to squeeze you titties
Mmm
