[Chorus]
Just because it's the middle of night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
Cause up, in, deep inside
It's pullin' me and I want your love
You and I should be gettin' it right
Ain't no sense in you holdin' on down
If I can't have you, nobody can
This an animal speakin' that'll hunt you down
So baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
Sex is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo

[Verse 1]
I, I show my teeth
And I hope you know that look in my eyes
Hey
I got lightnin' speed
I won't hesitate to rescue what is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, hold up baby, what's goin' on?
Tell the truth, I wanna know
What you're doin' when you go
Somethin' say you ain't alone
You say, "Baby keep holdin' on"
What you mean? I've been holdin' on
I ain't ever smelled this before
Somethin' say it's time to go

[Chorus]
Just because it's the middle of night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
Cause up, in, deep inside
It's pullin' me and I want your love
You and I should be gettin' it right
Ain't no sense in you holdin' on down
If I can't have you, nobody can
This an animal speakin' that'll hunt you down
So baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
Sex is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo

[Verse 2]
Taxidermy is on my walls
With the full description of the killin' cause
I'm a hunter
Cupid, thank you for what you did
But you can't aim and get what I get
I'm a hunter

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, hold up baby, what's goin' on?
Tell the truth, I wanna know
What you're doin' when you go
Somethin' say you ain't alone
You say, "Baby keep holdin' on"
What you mean? I've been holdin' on
I ain't ever smelled this before
Somethin' say it's time to go

[Chorus]
Just because it's the middle of night
That don't mean I won't hunt you down
Cause up, in, deep inside
It's pullin' me and I want your love
You and I should be gettin' it right
Ain't no sense in you holdin' on down
If I can't have you, nobody can
This an animal speakin' that'll hunt you down
So baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
Sex is callin', ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is callin', ooh-hoo

[Verse 3]
Duck Dynasty's cool and all
But they got nothin' on a female's call
I'm a hunter
Is that a tree, is that camouflage?
Come get eaten by the damn mirage
I'm a hunter

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, hold up baby, what's goin' on?
Tell the truth, I wanna know
What you're doin' when you go
Somethin' say you ain't alone
You say, "Baby keep holdin' on"
What you mean? I've been holdin' on
I ain't ever smelled this before
Somethin' say it's time to go

[Bridge]
You're leaving me
Why else would you let it go?
You can't be serious
You know what's in my blood, hey

[Outro]
So baby, ooh-hoo
My love is calling, ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is calling, ooh-hoo
Hey baby, ooh-hoo
Sex is calling, ooh-hoo
Hey hey baby, ooh-hoo
My love is calling, ooh-hoo
