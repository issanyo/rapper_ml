[Pharrell]
I was walking, down the street
Saw this girl, she smell so sweet
....Hey baby...
She start running, so I could chase
How they get them saffires, in yo face
....Hey baby...

So we start walking, and holding hands
But she don't know, that daddy got plans
I'm gon' get her, in my car
In the backseat, show her a rock star

She said, "I been hugged, and I been kissed
But ain't no other boy, make me feel like this."
....I know baby...
So then she starts screaming, and reaching for the door
"Daddy I ain't never felt this before!"

Stay in the car, put the windows up
No seatbelt, no need to buckle up
Emergency brakes, no need for the clutch
But wait... ah, don't get a ticket girl!

[Hook - Pharrell]

Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat love
Backseat love, backseat..
