[Verse 1: Boo-Bonic]
Yo, once the Mo start drippin', hoes start trippin'
Tell em my name Boo, you know we all hittin'
But look mami, I got 3 drinks in me, stuck
And I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna fuck
If the pussy gets wetter, chicks, I never sweat her
I'm gettin' all the cheddar
Bitch, read the letter, I patened the plan
Get a dick suck wit a gat in my hand
Bitch, it's thug passion
Chicks drive by in their whips, they be flashin'
"Do you know Bonic and Lib?", they be askin'
If the bitch wanna ask me shit, I'mma hit
Attitude just like Cancun, I'm a trip
Now niggas pissed, know why? 'Cause I'm the shit
If you cop a 5, imagine what I'm gon get
Lights out, Most Wanted bring the bikes out
Ball out, bitches on their back, ass all out
I got hoes wit accents, and I don't mean Hyundais
My hands touched more bricks than Kwame's
Ice'll blind you, for real, dog, believe me
Only feel comfortable around Ray Charles and Stevie
So I'mma take it easy

[Hook] (Female voice)
So why don't you run across the border mama?
(I'll run cross the border papa)
And what will you bring me back mama?
(You know what I'll bring you back papa)
So don't forget (I won't forget)
To bring me back (To bring you back)
What I need (What you need)
Tonight (Tonight)
Will you run across the border mama?
(I'll go cross the border papa)

[Verse 2: Mr. Man]
(Mister Mister) I know the fuck you heard
Give me head while I drive, bitch, I like to swerve
I'll take you to the airport so you can cop them birds
Now is you bout it, mami?
Whoa, let me know
Is it the dick, the car, the looks, or the dough?
She said, "Mostly the dough, playa, I don't lie"
I hit once, then hit her girlfriend
Ask, "When can we all get together again?"
Man, I never love hoes, what you talkin about?
I party your wife, nigga, you be eatin her out
And I sat there and told you that I cum in her mouth
And my connect the only reason she be runnin' down south
Bitches high for a ride dependin' who key startin'
So fuck a Jaguar, cop a Aston Martin
Pardon, no talkin', Mr. stay sparkin'
Niggas can't understand, they still walkin'

[Hook] (Female voice)
So why don't you run across the border mama?
(I'll run cross the border papa)
And what will you bring me back mama?
(You know what I'll bring you back papa)
So don't forget (I won't forget)
To bring me back (To bring you back)
What I need (What you need)
Tonight (Tonight)
Will you run across the border mama?
(I'll go cross the border papa)

[Verse 3]
[Boo-Bonic]
Hot ass whips is what they see Boo in
We play down in C-A-C-U-N
Uh, nice with the O play
Outta line, cut a bitch off like O.Jâ€”y'all ain't ready
That's why all y'all niggas look hurt when y'all see me
More Franklins than Kirk and I'm spendin' 'em with GP
Thick tube socks I rock like I'm from DC
Cash Money as a Juvenile like BG

[Mr. Man]
Top down on the Cadillac Allante
I get street stripes like Carlito Brigante
Dog, I tax y'all 'cause it costs to live
And still show no love like foster kids
I rent out homes in the hood and live across the bridge
My car's hotter than Negril
While y'all walk, I wheel
Oh, your Roley go tick and tock? It's not real
And keep a piece around my neck I know worth ya deal, nigga

[Hook] (Female voice)
So why don't you run across the border mama?
(I'll run cross the border papa)
And what will you bring me back mama?
(You know what I'll bring you back papa)
So don't forget (I won't forget)
To bring me back (To bring you back)
What I need (What you need)
Tonight (Tonight)
Will you run across the border mama?
(I'll go cross the border papa)
