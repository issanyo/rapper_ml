[Verse 1]
You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah, mmm
All this time I've stayed out of sight
I started wondering why, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I, oh now I wish it would rain (Girl, I wish it would rain)
Rain down on me (yeah yeah, yeah yeah, I wish)
Oh now I wish it would rain (Yeah)
Rain down on me (La da da da da da)

[Verse 2]
You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right, yeah yeah
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain
But it looks like I did it again, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh now, oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Down on me, yeah, oh, how I wish)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Da da da da da)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Rain down on me)
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me (Brothers, won't you help me sing this song?)

[Bridge]
Though your hurt is gone
Mine's hangin' on inside
And I know, it's getting me through this
I've waited, and waited on your side
'Cause I know, I know (I know)
I know I never meant to, never meant to
Never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down
But I know in my heart of hearts
I know I'm never gonna hold you again
Rain, yeah
Rain down on me
Da da da da da da

[Chorus]
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me
Rain down, rain down on me, yeah
Oh now I wish it would rain
Rain down on me

[Outro]
I wish, I wish it would rain
It would rain down on me
Rain, yeah
Oh now I wish it would rain
Oh...oh...wish it would rain, yeah
