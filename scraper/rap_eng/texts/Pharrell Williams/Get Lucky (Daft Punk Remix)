[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Like the legend of the phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus: Pharrell]
She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
The present has no ribbon
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus: Pharrell]
She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

[Bridge: Daft Punk]
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell]
We've come too far
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

[Chorus: Pharrell]
She's up all night to the sun, I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun, I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to the sun, we're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky, we're up all night to get lucky

[Outro: Pharrell]
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
We're up all night to get lucky
