[Sunrise]

[Verse 1: Jordan Rakei]
Waiting on the street
Ready, but at peace
My philosophy is that
I know, how the story goes
Just to see some steady flow, backwards
Never heard of, after

[Verse 2: Jordan Rakei]
Hold me, you wonderful
Beautiful moonlight
Hold on till this is over
Maybe 'til sunrise
Hold me, you wonderful
Beautiful moonlight
Hold on till this is over
Wait until sunrise

[Beautiful]

[Verse 1: Jordan Rakei]
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl, oh, ho, ho, oh
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
