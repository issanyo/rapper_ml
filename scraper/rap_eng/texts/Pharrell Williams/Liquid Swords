[Intro: Shogun, Pharrell & DJ Drama]
Choose the sword, and you join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother...in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
So...come boy, choose life or death
You can't be serious
I think so
You niggas can't be serious
This is what they wanted

[Verse 1]
Tuff guy nada
But it spots shit to I da
Finish with the spinach
Like the little nigga Pop-Eye
Scarf by Escada
Boots by Prada
Hermes bag and rag and sex with...

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
Liberace chains, hold my neck like an anchor
Love to my fans, you bought it so I thank ya
If you're a hater then I'm glad that I ain't ya
Couldn't see the light like baby Jesus in a manger
We wanted this life we salivated like wolves
Blow a hundred grand on L.V. leather goods
Lift up the doors, open trunk, open hood
Enzo horse power, crank it up and hear the hooves
My notebook was my hustle and flow stash
Young and ludicrous, my life had just crashed
Oooh had a chilly chilly past
Look at the Ice Cream symbol that's why the nigga laugh

[Verse 3]
I'm all about angels so I try to do that
But I only ended up with burning stubs on my back
So with that said lil' Skateboard's back
On the corner doubling down bricks to sell that track
Trying to drive that dress LR
Or laid back in back of that laid back
You know puffing on a Cuban cigar
In Brazil with Hype Williams watching the play back
This is living got to watch out for the driven
They'll kidnap your understanding and stab up your wisdom
One hit of that boy, boy, them niggas is schizing
Hog tie the family and blood bath the kitchen
This is a recipe to make niggas hate you
Face on the Newsweek the actress want to date you
Icecream boutique the Icecream skate shoe
Twelve pages in the women's American Vogue
Chanel ceramic watches just share with your hoes
Goyard trunks to travel there with your clothes
The engine just hums to send in the air and it goes
Lisa's in the lavatory she's puffing kush
Sara's on my lap with her head humming push
Shrimp and French fries right before I land
You take the ketchup and tell me where I am
Green Lantern it's your motherfucking man
Skateboard yessir
