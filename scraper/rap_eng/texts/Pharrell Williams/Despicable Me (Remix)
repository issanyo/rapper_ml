[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Im having a bad bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steam rolling whatever I see, huh
Despicable me
Iâ€™m having a bad bad day
If you take it personal thats ok
Watch this is so fun to see, huh
Despicable me

[Verse 1: Fixedgear E]
Why cook Top Ramen, when u claim u top dog
Why try and hide behind all that fog
Why u keep playing, when I'm undefeated
And why these other fools always get beasted
Why I gotta come out dressed like grim reaper
Why I be so O.G. Like beepers?
Better not come see me, that wouldn't be smart
I'll paint the town red, and call it street art

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fixedgear E]
Why burn slow when there's napalm
Why drop knowledge when I can drop bombs
Why everything about me so mean
And why I gotta fux with all of this lean
Why u think u finna win when I'm Autobots
But the better question is why not
I got more gadgets than terminator
Future celebrity problems while I'm trying to be greater

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fixedgear E]
Better run home before it gets dark
Me and my boys mobbin' like sharks
I have too much swag for you lames
Better bring a pen n take notes of my game
If you touch my girl, ill break your arm
Chop u up like a cow at a farm
Y'all haters keep adding fuel to my fire
I'm future hall of fame when I retire

[Hook]
