[Verse 1: Kōrudo]
Baby hi
*cough*
I love you
Nobody can ever love you the way that I do
I do
I do
Who knew
That you'd
Be my baby
Everlasting i'm not a lady
Not a lady
You're my baby
And I'm your baby
Your ass is so (so) so (so) so tasty

[Chorus: Kōrudo]
Baby x3
Oooh
Baby x3
You
I love you to the moon and back and
Tell me come with you
And I'll start packing
Them facts and
I'm pale I need a tan and
Never gonna let you go we'll keep relaxing
At night we'll be saxon
Oops I mean sexin'
All up in my bed an'
All about that dick
When I need it you be packin (P-Packin')

[Verse 2: Kōrudo]
Tell me why that you so cute
Get out of my head
*groan/moan*
I haven't tried to
Cuz I don't want to
Baby you're all that I think about
I'm useless without you
Out you
Out you
I'll never fuckin doubt you
Doubt you
Doubt you
That lisp is really cute
I think it, defines you x2

[Bridge: Kōrudo]
Uh huh x3
Ooh
Uh huh x2
Ooh
Uh huh x3
Oh

[Chorus: Kōrudo]
Baby x3
Oooh
Baby x3
You
I love you to the moon and back and
Tell me come with you
And I'll start packing
Them facts and
I'm pale I need a tan and
Never gonna let you go we'll keep relaxing
At night we'll be saxon
Oops I mean sexin'
All up in my bed an'
All about that dick
When I need it you be packin (P-Packin')
