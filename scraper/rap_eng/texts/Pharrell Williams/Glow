[Intro: Pharrell]
You see that glow that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
You see that glow, that high gloss
That high gloss, that high gloss
Here we go…

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I fuck around with them playmates, twenty thousand my day rate
Eating seven course meals now, people say that I gained weight
All you rappers you ain’t safe, more money, same face
Been the shit, still the shit, just double up, exchange rate
Guess who just grown up now? dockin' up, sit the fuck down
Had to speak to P, said I need a beat
To show these clowns I don’t fuck around
Asking me about money, wonder what’s my net worth
People try to come sue me, but I call up J.G. Wentworth
Yeah I glow, they don’t, I suppose that I'm dope
Spend 10 racks on my coat
Fuck a whip just bought me a boat
My flow is gross, be bread, get it I was toast
Without one, you reaching, you ain't’ close, get it, no

[Hook]
Oh you ain’t know? (oh you ain’t know?)
Since I was born (since I was born)
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)
Know I was poor
Don’t mind any bitch I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)
My world was snow (my world was snow)
What I need light fo’
Girl I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I rap a lot, rap a lot, don’t be afraid it’s just after-shock
Yeah jam like when Shaq grab the rock
I’m goin' in like a Magic shot
Know I rap sweet like apricots
Shut the fuck up you don’t have to talk
I’ma lay back with my ass on top
Got the game on masterlock muthafucker
You don’t see cash a lot, bitch stop acting like you bad you not
Put my dick in her ass twice, she look back like that's the spot
Call me, I’m counting money, play around with money
Y’all ain’t shit without ya money
Life ain't all about the money
Well it kinda is if you out of money
Mac Millions that’s the name
Most dope, that’s the game
Drunk bitch so glad you came
Saw her taking off her clothes, tryin' have a train
Hoes love us, tryna fuck us with no rubbers
Fuck that, we fuck each other, on tour we make her fuck the runner
Motherfucker, just the shit you need
You ain’t fuck around my team
Cause we living all of your dreams
Here to kill your self-esteem
And my flow is pyro
Smokin til my eyes close
Middle finger up high though
End this song on a high note

[Hook]
Oh you ain’t know? (oh you ain’t know?)
Since I was born (since I was born)
My mind was gone (my mind was gone)
Know I was poor
Don’t mind any bitch I just go (I just go)
And my wrist was cold (wrist was cold)
My world was snow (my world was snow)
What I need light fo’
Girl I’m bright as a bitch, I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
I’m so special (I’m so special)
Girl I’m white as a bitch I just glow

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I be eating that pink slime
Bitch, that pink slime
Motherfuckeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
