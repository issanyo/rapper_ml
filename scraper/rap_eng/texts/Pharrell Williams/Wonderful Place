Yeah, uh huh, lets do it
Damn,

[Verse 1]
It's setting in now
Cause cartoons are turning into real life
Lemons and limes are fighting
Fighting over straws like they were oil filled pipes
Why's the sun writing the song?
Why is this funny to me?
All of a sudden a mouse come along
And what he sings, it brings harmony

[Pre-Chorus]
You may not understand why there's a smile on my face
It's cause this world would be such a wonderful place
If some of these companies in two-thousand three get erased
But not me man, I see a wonderful place

[Chorus]
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up
Muscles in my smile, don't frown
Just get up, get up

[Verse 2]
The wallpaper's moving
My arms and my legs leave a blur when I swipe
Sap is just oozing
But trees say that smoke blocks the sun
So for them, it's just night
The seven eyes look in through the clouds
And why is that funny to me?
And here comes the mouse singing loud
And what he sings brings harmony

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

*Waiting For You (Bonus Track)*

[Verse 1l]
So she tells her man:
"Let's go fishin'"
We'll go tomorrow morning when the sun rise
And then she says she wants to take her kids and (baby crying)
That's her boy that's 12 and her daughter that's 4 with angel eyes
So they get there
And the sun has barely risen
Decided on a spot where the fish is plentiful with the tide
Get out their poles
Daddy smiles and said the fish is jumpin'
Then they heard a splash but it sounded bigger than fish size
12 year old screams "Mom!"
And Mom screams back "the baby was holdin' your arm"
Well that was 30 seconds ago
So they jumped in
All comin' up with nothin'
But then...
Something told mom
To look toward the light
But the sun wasn't yellow
It had turned white
So she listen and swam
She swam for the light
Like the Michelin Man
She swam with such might
She spotted the baby
And she was on her back
Just as the light said "Sunrise was Heaven's track"
She turned the baby over
Her eyes were still blue
The baby had a smile and said
"I was waitin' for you!
Mom I was waitin' for you!"
Your baby
Momma, I love you
And I was waitin' for you
Hey

[Outro]
I was waitin' for you
I was waitin' for you
Momma
I was waitin' for you
Love you ma
