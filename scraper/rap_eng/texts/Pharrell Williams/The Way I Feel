[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
I feel like I'm in love
It's too much hype, just because
I feel like sayin' something that's for us
That defines what's in our hearts

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
This feels right, as the buzz
And it don't describe when we uh
You feel my heartbeat thumpin' from your touch
In my life, you were my luck

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The morning
Hopefully at 10 o'clock we're both yawnin'
Right now
Think about it later, let's just both get down

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Dancin' and we're playin' around
You know you've got me
And then the feelin' comes rainin' down
All over my body
It tingles here, tingles there
Ooh, it tingles everywhere
That's why I've never found
The way to describe it

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Ugh, you better ask for forgiveness now
Me and Miley about to rip shit down
And she bored of the misfits
You motherfuckers better hope that I can't fit this crown
And how did we get this sound?
Gotta say thanks to P Willy
Feel it gettin' island tsunami in Hawaii
And the beaches say hey 'cause the Preme Free Willy

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't describe
The way I feel, the way I feel
Oh, what a high
The way I feel, the way I feel
I just can't put in words
What I feel for you
The way I feel, the way I feel
It feels so good it hurts
What you do
The way I feel, the way I feel
