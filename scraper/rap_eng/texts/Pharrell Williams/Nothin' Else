[Verse 1]
I was just walking that day, aimlessly (Oh, oh, no)
You picked a perfect day to bump into me (Perfect day)
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason, we still met at your store (You, baby)
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well (Hey)
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings
Oh

[Chorus]
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

[Verse 2]
All my friends meet you and say you're the one
(You're the one, you're the one, yeah)
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
(I should just leave them alone)
You had a friend, but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads "Please move on with me"
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
(Use my heart, forget my eyes)
And that's the way to his kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1

[Chorus]
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me

[Bridge]
There's nothin' else in this world
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?

[Verse 3]
I've been asking everybody what they think
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatum's for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'ma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatum's on me; that's no fun

[Outro]
I was just walking that day, aimlessly
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, dum-dum-dum-dum, oh, ooh
Da, da da-dum, ooh, ooh
