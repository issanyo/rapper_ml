I can't imagine my life without you
You just don't understand, the dilemma I was in
I can't believe I could get myself into this
It's part two of this shit, but I can't let go

Remember them days
You would stare at my face
And I would look the other way
I'm clear but it's just in case (oh)
A sneaky girl looked on the sly (oh)
Sent an e-mail 'bout you and I (oh)
If it got back we would just lie (oh)
If it got back we would just lie

One day you took a step so special
I got fuzzy and warm inside
I waited impatiently to get you
Now we don't have to hide (hide)

Together we don't have to hide (I hate this)
Together we don't have to hide (I hate this)
Together we don't have to hide (I hate this)
Together we don't have to hide (I hate on ya too)
Together we don't have to hide (I hate on ya too)

Can't hold my hand though but we got matchin' tattoos
