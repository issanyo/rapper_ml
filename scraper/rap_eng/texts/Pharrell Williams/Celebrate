I want the whole world to celebrate!
(Let’s Go!)

I wanna come home
To the only place I know
Where the trees are planted, grow
I wanna come ho-oh-oh-ome

Once I get up I feel better
And I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK

Everyone says now or never
I say only if its better
Being young like this forever
But we know better

I want the whole world to celebrate (x4)

I'll be just fine
When I see you at the finish line
It doesn't matter if I take my time
I'm comin ho-oh-oh-ome

Once I get up I feel better
And I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK

Everyone says now or never
I say only if its better
Being young like this forever
But we know better

I want the whole world to celebrate (x4)

I'm not mad at you at all, but
I want the whole world to celebrate, yeah

Right about now it’s time for everybody to stand up
And have fun!
Cus we just begun!
I want the whole world to celebrate (let's go!)

Once I get up I feel better
And I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK

Everyone says now or never
I say only if its better
Being young like this forever
I wanna come home

I want the whole world to celebrate (I wanna come home) (x8)
Oh-oh-oh
