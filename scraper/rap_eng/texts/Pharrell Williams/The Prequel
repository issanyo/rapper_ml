I mean you know what it is, you see it man
I was inspired by Slick Rick, y'know?
Like he used to just come on TV and just shit on niggas real quick
Like just shit, like y'know
And just wave his fingers around the world and call us "crumbs" and shit
I was hurt, stunned, astounded, amazed and dazed, and confused as a child
When the nigga did the "Young World" video, the "Hey Young World" shit
That shit changed my life so, y'know when you see me rolling around here looking like Slick Rick
You know where the fuck it's coming from
You know what I'm sayin'? So for me, I wanted to y'know
I wanted to have a conversation to all my fans, y'know what I'm sayin'
That's on the water in the hood doing what they do
On that grind every day, cause I know that
I know what that is, y'know what I'm sayin'?
And who's the grimiest nigga in the street, y'know what I mean?
DJ Drama
And I mean it's my first mixtape and shit, know what I mean there's more to come, so
We 'gon do what it is we gotta do
