[Hook: Pusha T]
How you think I got it? The Benz, the hoes
The home, I stand on my own nigga, come on
How you think I got it? The watch, the chains
The Range, the fucking street fame

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Bitch I sell caine, rotate them chickens like a weather vane
The wind blow, it come and go, I'm hurricane
Listen again, I hurry caine, don't make me
Got to Miami and bury Wayne, now check it
I'm the same nigga, make a G off a key
You think it's small change? They never send less than 50
Now I'm factoring that they're gone by day three
So tell me what an 80-gram verse mean to me
Keep inflating your numbers, I somersault, rap wonder
Bread if I'm over your head, nigga, better than
Them halos and angels, my money flows through a triangle
The holder of the keys watch the price dangle

[Verse 2: Ab-Liva]
Powder in the rubble, I'll show you how to hustle
Rip that heart into a million pieces like a puzzle
I'm Mario Puzo, Godfather
Puppet string pull on them prices, quarter-backs, color huddle
It's never record, no, it's no rebuttal
That snow removal, no need for a shovel
When going got tough and the pressures got doubled
I shuddered and worked sitting clean in the recent
B-entley but how it preempts me
To go soft or hard-top, the sun te-mpts me
I adhere to my calling, Katrina with the cook
I flood the city like New Orleans, I'm too heavy so the levies break
Sitting on my money I'm stacking, I start to levitate
David Blaine, see through the top, I'm in the better space
Better place, hare and the tortoise, I'm at a better pace
Olympian, ran over niggas, we run a better race

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sandman]
They wanna put me in a Porsche, little-ass box
Fuck you nigga, I'm as large as an ox
Seat back, head ball, keep that ghetto
Motherfucking balls when I bounce down the block (Fat Daddy)
[?]in my stroom, my pockets all swole
Get out a pocket, I'm a poppet, let the rockets explode
Booyah, had to do ya, remove ya, the ruga
Fuck em niggas' lies, nightmares like Fred Krueger
Abrasive talk, get you chasers stalked
[?] bark you trace the chalk, carry 'em off
Ks is soft, turn the bundles of hard rock
It's an all-stap I found treat em right like [?]
So what I do? 14 off a bean
Interstate 80 inches minus the triple beam
It's a fiend what my soldiers sold em, boulders
Bigger than your shoulders (Re-Up motherfucker!)

[Bridge]

[Verse 4: Malice]
If all I talk about is coke, let that tell you something
A fiend for them keys I'm-a cutting
Fuck being broke with dreams full of nothing
My niggas cope and slave over ovens
Welcome to the big league, bitches leading husbands
Fucking with these rich boys, who am I to judge?
On the price, I won't budge
Just double up on birds like Noah and the flood
That's the sort of topic no one is above
And you ain't saying nothing if you're burning the glove
I spread love like a mercenary
Get it shipped untouched, that Virgin Mary
In the art of culinary
We'll pass with flying colors, my niggas is honorary
And my drive is monetary
The jewels around my neck got us like Ben and Jerry
