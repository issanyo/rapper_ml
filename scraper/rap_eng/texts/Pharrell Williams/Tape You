[Verse 1]
Babe
For what I'm about to ask
Don't be ashamed
I just love you girl
Babe
As time will surely pass
Love shows it flame
In my fuck you world

Relax girl
Sip some of my slurpee
You don't have to lie to me
It's fly to me
And this way
You can have your privacy
And at the same time I can see

[Chorus]
Look, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey baby, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah

[Verse 2]
Babe, please don't let this make you think my love has swayed
No way okay
Baby girl
This is not her idea
It's mine single-handedly
It's just my fantasy
There's only one and when you're done
It's ours just for fun
And then please give me some
Listen we'll call her gold and you'll be platinum
I just want to see you come ...out

[Chorus]
Look, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Look here sugar, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you mama, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah

[Bridge]
Nah baby don't worry about
Your makeup
I promise I won't be jealous and break up
Not to patronize and sound fake but
If this is a dream I don't want to wake up
Nah baby don't worry about
Your makeup
I promise I won't be jealous and break up
Not to patronize and sound fake but
If this is a dream I ain't wakin' up

[Verse 4]
Turn on the purple lights
Begin flashin'
By removing your fashion
And start tongue lashin'
Now girl kiss her boobs
And you kiss her boobs too
And let your finger dash in
Lights, camera, action

[Outro]
Tape you, all night, yeah
Hey sugar, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey little mama, I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yeah
Hey I just wanna, tape you, little mama
I just wanna, tape you, all night, yow!
I just wanna, tape you, you and your girl, baby
Hey little mama, you and your girl, all night
Just tapin'
It's just my fantasy
Don't be afraid
It's all right (and cut)
