[Hook:]
Stand in the front and shake it out for the god (x4)
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Ma get dumb to the drum
When it come to the crack you know just where to get it from
I'm the unbelievable, unstoppable as logical
I'm setting it off, now take your draws off (hoo)
Now, go'head and do ya little thang
I love when you ass go bri bibibi pong pa ting
I analyse emotion when you rockin' with a swing
Looking just keep it going and make it poppin' till it sting (oh, shit!)
With ya supernova ass
Put it on me you see my drink spillin' out up of my glass now (now)
Don't even worry 'bout it mami keep it gudda (sup)
One of another glass and a bottle pour another one (ha)
Lean over put ya head back quick

Go'head and spread that sick
Get that sick ass over here and do what I'm saying (yeah that's it!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Gettin' money and showing ya niggas how to live
Jump off we get the party let's get it right (what!)
Now all of my bitches let's take it to the crib (now!)
Leave them 20-niggas frontin' ya know

[Hook]

[Bridge: Pharrell]
It's the break down, it's your favorite part
It's the break down, keep it going don't stop
It's the break down, make it do what it do
It's the break down, act like it's made for you
Get ugly, act retarded, scrunch that face, move that body
Break down, what what, break down, what what, break down

[Verse 3]
Here I am, be R.A.W
So fuck with me I'm here to bring double
To the platinum feel and retrieving a million
Triple up with the bitches exotic and fuck me a brazilian (ha)
Ha ha ha, laugh at a bunch of you niggas
When I'm comming I switch it like a chameleon
And then decided it back and find a g-stro candidate
To swimming it commin' swallow my children (aaa-ha ha ha)
Go'head and sing my song gettin' money you bitches
Now tell me what you really on
Back on my bu-bu-bullshit I move quick pullsix
Bitches make it to sit on my poolstick (to the left!)
I see yo ass is ready, willing, enable (to the right!)
Yo ass is knockin' my bottles of the table (shit)
You see he's out in the spot so let's go
Strip down on ya g-stro before the club close

[Hook] (x2)
