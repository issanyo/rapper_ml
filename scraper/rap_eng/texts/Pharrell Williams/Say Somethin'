[Intro: Snoop Dogg & (Mariah Carey)]
Yeah, say somethin' (ooh)
Say somethin', say somethin', yeah, damn (ohh)
Say somethin', say somethin', damn (oooh, ohh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & (Snoop Dogg)]
I'm over here, looking at you
You are over there, watching me too
Both painting pictures of, of how we'll kiss and hug
So what we gon' do?
(So what you gon' do, so what you gon' do?)
Tell me why we're standing here
The moment's fresh and so sincere
You've got my mind blown and baby, I'm ready to go (Hey!)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Hey, well
If it's worth your while, say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while, say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while, do somethin' good to me

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey, (Snoop Dogg), Pharrell]
Let's make it
Hot as you can stand it, somethin' like volcanic
You and me seems organic just like the stars and planets
Yeah, we are, so what you gon' do?
(So what you gon' do, what you gon' do?)
Tell me why we're still in here
There's nothing for us to fear
I could tell with my eyes closed, now, baby, I'm ready to go
(Hey!)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Hey, well
If it's worth your while, say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while, say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while, do somethin' good to me
If it's worth your while, say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while, say somethin' good to me, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while, do somethin' good to me

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Every time I fall though, want me to speak on the word or two
It's the D-O, double-G, and I do it so lover-ly
Digging this track by the Neptune's
Baby girl follow me to the restroom
Now get buck wild, shh, don't make a sound
I'll take you, lay you down
Make your body go 'round and 'round
Do you want me to, don't say you won't, I know you do
Most girls play shy, it won't hurt until you give it a try
I know you like my smile
Dig my style, dig the bow wow

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Hey, well
If it's worth your while, say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while, say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while, do somethin' good to me
If it's worth your while, say somethin', say somethin'
If it's worth your while, say somethin' good to me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
If it's worth your while, do somethin' good to me
