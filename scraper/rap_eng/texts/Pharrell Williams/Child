[Verse 1]
I ain't mad
Oh, there's just something in my eyes
Oh, my eyes are red
Oh, trust me child
My cup runneth over
And over
And over
And over
Come look closer
It runs over
And over
And over

[Chorus]
They say child
Poor child
They say child
Aren't you glad that's over?

[Verse 2]
When you leave part of my dreams
When you've gone to places I've seen
When you've heard the awesomest stories, and you're only sixteen

[Chorus]
It'll make you say child
I say child
My cup runneth over
Ooh, I'm so much closer

[Verse 3]
I know they say let go, and let God
But when you're so close, oh, it's so hard
What a feeling when you do
How you think I'm sitting here singing out to you

[Chorus]
People call and say child
Poor child
They said I'm watching now
And my cup runneth over
And over

[Bridge]
Dream, don't stop dreaming child
Dream, don't stop dreaming child
Dream, don't stop dreaming child
Dream, don't stop dreaming child

[Verse 4]
So I ain't mad
Oh, there's just something in my eyes
My eyes are red
Oh, trust me child
My cup runneth over
And over
And over
And over
