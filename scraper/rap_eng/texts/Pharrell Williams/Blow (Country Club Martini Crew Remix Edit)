[Intro (Pharrell)]
I love your face (I love your face)
You love the taste (I do)
That sugar babe, (So sweet)
It melts away

[Verse 1]
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, You like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Hook]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle (yeah)
Pink is the flavor
Solve the riddle (yeah)
I'm-a lean back
Don't worry it's nothing major
Make sure you clean that
It's the only way to get the
Flavor

[Verse 2]
When you're thirsty and need love
I give it up 'til I'm empty babe
Must be good to you
If you're lonely in your bed, fill it up to the top
Must be good to you

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Interlude]
I'm about to get into this, girls
This is for all the grown women out there

[Bridge]
I hear the sound of that wrapper coming off
Yeah the wrapper coming off, coming off in your love
Licking on the lollipop, yeah the wrapper coming off for my sugar and your touch
Hope you ready for this jelly, put the fire in my belly
Now pop back, steady steady
That ain't hot, show me all you got
Boy you can't get enough, I'm addicted to this love
Je ne sais quoi
Cherie, m'vle-ou
Aswe ya ce net al kole!

[Verse 3]
On the day you finish me, I kiss you and you lick your lips and so do I
Know you never waste a drip, so don't you wonder how it feels sometimes

[Pre-Hook (Pharrell)]
Keep me coming, keep me going, (keep me going)
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, (keep me moaning)
Won't stop loving 'til the morning, ('til the morning girl)
Blow, (ooh)

[Outro-Hook (Pharrell)]
Can you eat my skittles?
It's the sweetest in the middle
Can you eat my skittles?
Can you eat my skittles?
(Sweetest in the middle baby)
Skittles, skittles, skittles
Blow
