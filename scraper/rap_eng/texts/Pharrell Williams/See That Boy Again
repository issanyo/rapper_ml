[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I remember standing there groovin'
Noddin' my head, just movin'
My girlfriend dragged me to this place
Starin' at the crowd like we do
I saw this guy at the table
And that's when I saw your face
But you came over to me
As sweet as can be
And grabbed my left hand
Started steppin'
What else did I need to know
I'd say 'Yes!' if you wanted to go
Cause you were havin'
But you left me here

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I gotta see that boy again
Cause I gotta feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again
Listen to me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
My girlfriend says introduce her
But I ain't gonna lie when I lose her
That's so nice you want to pay
Ooh you have a way with females
I didn't get your number or e-mail
What the hell was in my brain?
Oh I know that you'd believe
But I couldn't let you see
That I was stressin'
I lost my breath and
Then you grabbed your Mercedes keys
But you pulled before you leave
And I just stood there
Like I didn't have a care

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I gotta see that boy again
Cause I gotta feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again
Listen to me

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
It's like the part in the movie
The Getaway
Oh no, not the person you want
The person you want to lose him
So you pray
But the circumstances
Changes course
Which is entirely
Up to the boss
But remember
That just because it's written
Don't mean you can't play
You had to change your fate

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
So I wanna see that boy again
Cause I wanna feel that joy again
I remember leanin', on your shoulder
Somethin' to call up, what he order?
That's why I, I am on this floor, I'm on this floor
Looking for you, where did you go?
Where did you go?
I'm on this floor
I don't wanna leave without you baby, yeah
Yeah, where went my baby?
I can see you standing there
