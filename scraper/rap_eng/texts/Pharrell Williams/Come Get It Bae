[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
You miss me?
I miss all of y'all
All of you girls standin' together like that
I can't take it

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Wait a minute
Women, I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
None of them boys know the first thing
About your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it
Just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Wait a minute
I can see it the way you like
I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on TV

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
None of them boys know the first thing
About your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it
Just like me

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams and Miley Cyrus]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you

[Bridge A: Miley Cyrus, Pharrell Williams, and Tori Kelly]
There comes a time
When craving will grab your wrist
You'll need a sugar fix, baby
There comes a time
And you won't believe what you'll do
When that sugar's callin' you

[Bridge B: Pharrell Williams]
Girl, now it's your time, this is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E, satisfaction guaranteed
And now it's your time, this is where you wanna be
Cause everything you need, you will only find in me

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
Come get it bae, come get it bae
You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high to
Take it easy on the clutch, cause girl I like you

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
