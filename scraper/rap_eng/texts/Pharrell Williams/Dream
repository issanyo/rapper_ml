Thought it was monday
It was actually sunday

Can’t even express
How much lovin’
I felt from you

It wasn’t a dream
I hope you know
It’s not what
It seems

I’m you’re, wet dream
You’re wet dream
You make love to me
In you’re, wet,wet dream

Oh cherry, sweet pea
Do you know
What you do to me
You make me drip like
A cup
Sweet and soft baby
It’s enough

And i
I hope you know that
It’s not what it, seems
It’s just a little

Wet, dream
