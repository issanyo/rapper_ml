[Intro]
(Alicia, what you wanna do?) I wanna do it again
(Alicia, what you wanna do?) I wanna do it again
(Alicia, what you wanna do?) I wanna do it again
(You wanna what?) Oh (What?) Hey (What?)
Give it to me now

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed (Mmm-hmm, lright)
And I still remember everything you said (Heyyyy, alright)
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong (Wrong, alright)
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone
(And you know I'm not tryna hear that)

What I wanna know, baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me... give it to me now

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me

[Verse 2]
Still like a fire on a rainy night (Fire on a rainy night, oh)
Still like it better when you're holding me so tight
(Better hold me tight, ooh)
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part
(Nooo, no, alright)
Tell me baby why, why you wanna go and break my heart

All I wanna know baby, if what we had was good
How come you don't call me...give it to me now

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me

[Bridge]
Now ladies you know
When you have something so good with a man
And all of a sudden its just, its just over like that u feel like...
Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, papa
Ooh, you got to try
How come you don't call me...give it to me now

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
(Hey, now what I gotta do to make it through...)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me
(...all of the things you put me through?)
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, call me

'Cause even thought we fuss and fight
You can call and make it right
Call me (Fire on a rainy night)
Say why don't you call me?
I gotta know, what i do to you, baby?
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)

[Outro: (Alicia Keys) + Justin Timberlake]
(Said all my sisters...) How come he don't call you no more?
(Alright) If he don't, I will call you for sure—come on, baby
How come he don't call you no more? (Alright)
If he don't, I will call you for sure—come on, baby
(Oh boy, you gotta tell me something—alright...oh, hey, oh...)
