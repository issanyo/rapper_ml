[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
Bought a big house and a whole lot of rangers
A fresh new couch and a whole lot of trainers
A closet full of clothes and some brand new dangers
And some Mexican floral arrangers
A great big TV that'll entertain us
Some colorful commissions for some high-paid painters
Someone to take the rap so that I stay stainless
And a new relationship with a banker
Two pinky rings for my manicured fingers
A trained German Shepherd that bark when it's angered
To watch my possessions and look out for strangers
And a fifty-foot yacht with an anchor
Young supermodel that shall remain nameless
Ups and the downs, the sames and the changes
All the money in the world don't make it painless (No)

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(Plain Pat what up?)
Lifestyles of the broke and famous
Let you know how crazy this game is
Look at all the new beautiful faces
At home supermodel, Myspaces
Long for their shot on the TV screens
American Idol never seen these dreams
Just last week they want to see ID
Now they got you in VIP, huh?
How many people almost famous?
You almost remember what they name is
Like "Hey, didn't you play in..?
No, it couldn't be, quit playin'"
And try to keep that balance after MTV
That's a Real World Challenge
Back on that train
Never to be heard from again

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
G.R.I.P P.I.M.P
I, any spelling bitch come on that's me
I bring a burning sensation to the urban eye
Like an eye drop of turpentine
You can listen to the serpent, fine
But the earth got gas, once it burps it's fine
Someone around me they talk about degrees
Not GHG, how to cook a quarter key
Talking all nasal, he ain't over that cold
No glove, scrub, man he just over that stove
Perfect paradigm, wrong place, wrong time
Should have been Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline
Number one chemist, look at him, no blemish
Egg shell off white like a DuPont finish
Young, dumb, high strung, who could handle us
I wonder how God's gon' paint todays canvasses
'Cause who knew that day that man would just
Go to VA with a Tec and spray campuses?
What a way to see the cover of Time
I know that nigga wish he was standing in line
To see it, as if he didn't do it

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Thom Yorke]
(But they love it and they love it)
The more you try to erase me
(And they love it and they love it)
The more that I appear, oh
(and they love it and they love it)
The more, the more you try the eraser
The more that you appear
