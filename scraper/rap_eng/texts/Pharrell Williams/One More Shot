I tried to tell him no
But he couldn't hear nothin'
He gave me chills
When he spoke up in my ear tonight
One word I lose control
He said baby don't go
I guess he didn't know about the, the other side
When we're close got me feelin' right
Oh no

If I don't go home now, hey
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning
If I take one more shot, oh
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning

What am I gonna do?
He touchin' on my body
And he, he doing things I ain't ever seen before
No, please don't close the door
Yeah oh baby you
You the type I get in trouble with in
You start passin' me the bottle
I don't want no more
Oh no, oh

If I don't go home now, hey
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning
If I take one more shot, oh
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning

Oh, how do I get out of here?
He breakin' my wall down
My guards are gone now
Somebody save me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, he's comin' from everywhere
Ready to give in, Misbehavin'
Somebody stop me

If I don't go home now, hey
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I take one more shot, oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning

If I take one more shot
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning
Don't wanna hate myself in the morning
Don't let me hate myself in the morning
Oh no, oh oh woah, oh woo
Don't let me hate myself
Don't let me hate myself
Don't let me hate myself
Oh no, oh oh woah, oh woo
Don't let me hate myself
Don't let me hate myself
One more shot
If I take one more
One more shot
Woo!

Somebody give me one more shot! (Ha, hahahaha!)
