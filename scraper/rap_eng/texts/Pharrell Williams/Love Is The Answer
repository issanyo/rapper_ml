[Verse 1]
Broken hearts everywhere
From stepping on love we don't care
Somebody tell me what we gonna do
Even though it's plenty to share
People hungry in the streets life just ain't fair
But you never think about it until it's you

[Pre-Hook]
Now I'm gonna say how I feel
And what I wanna say is  love is the only thing that's real
Now I'm gonna tell you what to do
Just believe that love is the only thing we have that's true

[Hook]
Love is the answer
Love is the answer
Love is the answer to the questions in your mind
If you looking it's the answer that you'll find
It's the only thing that everybody needs
It's the only thing that makes us truly free

[Verse 2]
Friends nowhere to be found
To help you when you are down
But you know that you're the one to blame
We know what's wrong from what's right
Nobody wins in a fight but still we play the game

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Just look around the whole wide world
So many beautiful things to see
Take my hand and come along
Spread some love with me
