[Verse 1]
They built this city outside the walls
You and I, we stood and watched it grow (oh)
They left the king, gone it all
So why don't we just clean it up and go (oh)

[Verse 2]
If you lay these bricks on tower tall
No one will think you can turn it into gold (oh)
So tell the ceilings on the floor
We don't tilt the holding just to watch you fall (fall)

[Chorus]
It happens, a feeling, come on like a crescendo
The moment, withstand it, beating against my window
Yeah, it's all mine
So baby, the street sounds, that's when I feel the wind blow

[Verse 3]
...
We don't really need a car to talk (ho)
We might not know which way to walk
But to stay here for an eternity, and no (no)

[Verse 4]
When you're filling up the tank, let it overflow
And listen to the static on the telephone (oh-oh)
There's no need to understand
Just get your things, you step outside the door (oh)

[Chorus]
It happens, a feeling, come on like a crescendo
The moment, withstand it, beating against my window
Yeah, it's all mine
So baby, the street sounds, that's when I feel the wind blow

[Bridge]
Oooh-ooooh-ooooh-ooooh
I hear it flow, the crescendo
Oooh-ooooh-ooooh-ooooh
I hear it flow, the crescendo
Oooh-ooooh-ooooh-ooooh
I hear it flow, the crescendo
Oooh-ooooh-ooooh-ooooh
I hear it flow, the crescendo

[Chorus]
It happens, a feeling, come on like a crescendo
The moment, withstand it, beating against my window
Yeah, it's all mine
So baby, the street sounds, that's when I feel the wind blow

[Outro]
I hear it flow, the crescendo
I hear it flow, the crescendo
