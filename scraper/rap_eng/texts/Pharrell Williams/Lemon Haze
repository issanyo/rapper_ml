[verse 1]
When I’m kissing you
I taste a fruity taste
You make me creative
I taste that lemony Haze
You cure my anxiety
You’re uplifting
We’re tapping tip to limping
You’re supper energetic
You make my mood enhanced
We felt a beat we got up and danced

[pre-Chorus]
I know you got that yellow aesthetic
I know you are a little poetic
Baby I know are love is synthetic
Baby our love is sweet and sour like a lemon 🍋 Oooh oooh OOh

[Chorus]
You are my favorite strain
So let’s smoke a blunt filled
With lemon haze
Baby I know our numbers and you are Dazed
Life is filled with lemons
Blaze those lemons today
You are like a Lemon Haze

[verse 2]
Whew Chile
I noticed
The ghetto in you
But maybe I need to live on the wild side
Join the gang that’s blue
I’m really over that mood
I’ve been feeling lately
That I don’t care
And I got shit figured out
When you think you got life
Figured out
Life will make several other turns
And it will make you learn
That we just need to chill but stay on our grind
I want they message to stay in you’re minds

[verse 3]
White Skin
Orange beanie
Yellow hair
Magic like a genie
Iconic like sweetener
Life Deal us cards
Then you come through
Like the sweetener you are You bring the bitter taste to a halt
Oh baby baby baby
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Imma get it, get it, get it
I can feel the lemony taste (ya)
Oh baby I feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

[Chorus]
You are my favorite strain
So let’s smoke a blunt filled
With lemon haze
Baby I know our numbers and you are Dazed
Life is filled with lemons
Blaze those lemons today
You are like a Lemon Haze
