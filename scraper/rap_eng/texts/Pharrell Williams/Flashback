Verse 1: Kelis
Flashbacks of the last summer
It was hot and I was bored
I took a walk to the corner store
I was at the counter
And that's when you walked by
Holding your St. Ides
You just brushed up in my side
I swear I got butterflies

Chorus:
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
You make me come alive

Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go

Verse 2:
Oh shit, there you go again
Speaking can't be a sin
So I fingered you over
Caesar and tattooed shoulders
Girls know your name badly
But to me you're my daddy
Though you only shook my hand
Could have sworn you held me

Chorus:
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
You make me come, oh yeah, alive

Bridge:(X2)
I'm so blessed I found you
You make all my days brand new
Late at night you call my name
And early in the morning
The thought of sex is soaring
Like a plane

Chorus:
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
You make me come alive

Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go

Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
Oh, you make my body go
Yeah yeah
You make me come, oh yeah, alive
