[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm an outlaw
Quick on the draw
Somethin' you've never seen before
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face
I got something chrome
And I got it from home
And it ain't a microphone
And I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It's so real how I feel
Cause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill
I'm just straight ill, ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While politicians is soundin' like strippers to me
They sayin', but I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
It's a raw night
Who wants to bar fight?
Well come on, alright
And I dare a *motherfucker* to come in my face
Baseball bats
I got something for that
It goes bla-ka-ka-kat
So I dare a motherfucker to come in my face

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
It's so real how I feel
Ause this society, that makes a nigga wanna kill
I'm just straight ill, ridin' my motorcycle down the streets
While the government is soundin' like strippers to me
They keep sayin', but I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free

[Verse 3: Lee Harvey]
When you think of Harvey, think of a Harley
Blue denim, spiked wrists and 'Crombie
Slap-screws and tattoos, that's all me
Two blondes, both arms, feelin' like Fonzie
You can find me drunk, whippin' it might crash
Or find me chillin' with crackers who like thrash
Find me in court, smokin' that nice grass
Burnin' the flag, all in the name of white trash
It's Harvey baby, Christ on the arm, I'm gnarly, baby
Fuck with me? Not hardly, baby
And you know the flow ungodly, baby
So let's party, baby
Chicks nickname me Pilot, they get high off my *dick*
I take 'em to my home, they call it the cockpit
Time for take off, the panties they drop quick
Now that's first class *fuckin'*, ain't that some fly *shit*?

[Chorus: Vita]
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
Ooh, baby, you want me?
Well, you can get this lapdance here for free
