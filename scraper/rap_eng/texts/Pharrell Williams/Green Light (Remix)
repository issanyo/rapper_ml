[Intro: Beyoncé Young Buck]
Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama Come On!
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama Get'em, B!
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama Here we go!
Give it Young Buck, Beyonce
Give it to mama, mama Hey!!!

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
For some strange reason
You’re done pleasin' me like it’s okay
Like a perm that’s been left too long (it’s starts to burn)
The result is it just won’t take (I can see)
Now it’s all coming so clear to me now (I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can’t do
My stock just went up over 2 million

[Hook: Beyoncé]
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
(Give it to mama)
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, red light, green light

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Some see me, say I should be trophied
Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know (yeah girl, ya’ll know)
This pimp shit gets no older
Is that a threat? (What’s another threat?)
Yep! (that’s another threat)
I’m immune, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you the king, right?
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, go. Oh, Oh
Go, go, red light, green light
(I said you’re holdin' up traffic, green means go!)

[Hook 2: Beyoncé]
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
So if you want to (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh), you got the green light (Uh-huh, Uh, Uh)
Give it to mama
Ain’t no problem, you can go (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
I will find somebody else (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
So why not move along? (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
You got the green light so you can go (Go, go, go. Oh, Oh)
Go, go, red light, green light

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I gave all I could give
My love, my heart
Now we’re facing the end
From what you did
From the start, my love

[Verse 3: Young Buck Beyoncé]
I’ve been sittin' at this Red Light, ready to go
You know I slowed down once but I won’t no mo'
Baby girl hold on, better buckle your seat belt
I told you to holla when he left
I know he tried to buy your heart with a black card
Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart, homeboy would already know
Put a queen of your team, the hoes got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
He’ve been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain’t nothin' like thug love, and thats real
I’m a lay back, you grab the wheel
I can handle it, Get the candles lit
Got to take advantage of every chance you get
So if ya’ll ain’t hear me, B. let'em know
You’re holdin' up traffic, green means go!
OOOH!!!

[Hook 2: Beyoncé]
