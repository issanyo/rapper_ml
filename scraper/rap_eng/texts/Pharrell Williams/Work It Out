[Verse 1]
How you doing honey baby?
You know I don't ask for much, but
For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough
But I get a knock on my door
You know it's yours for sure
We can't wait for the bedroom
So we just hit the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Is y'all alright?
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright?
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Uh, break it down now

[Chorus]
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

[Hook]
Chad, blow your horn now
Come on Chad, blow your horn now

[Verse 2]
So we shaking back and forth now
Just keep it coming babe
Treat my body like a guitar
You got to - you got to keep on strumming
But in the back of my mind
I wonder is it gonna be the last time?
Well if there ain't nobody loving and you gon' keep it coming
Well baby with me that's fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Is y'all alright?
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Uh, break it down now
Is y'all alright?
I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl
Is y'all alright?
Uh, break it down now

[Chorus]
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

[Hook]
Chad, blow your horn now
Come on Chad, blow your horn now

[Spoken]

Look it here, ha

[Bridge]
So baby hold me like you don't wanna let go
I'm feeling foxy cause boy you working it out
Daddy you've given me a taste of your honey
I want the whole beehive
I'm gonna call you my sugar
Cause I had the sweetest time

[Chorus]
See you gotta work it out
See you gotta work it out
A brotha gotta work it out

I like it when the horn go [x4]
