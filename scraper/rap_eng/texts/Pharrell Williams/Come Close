[Intro]
It's just a fly love song, what
It's just a fly love song, what

[Verse 1]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

[Verse 2]
Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me
May have to die with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

[Verse 3]
You help me to discover me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny that we connected girl
You and I, we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me, baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you
(We're gon' make it
I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight
