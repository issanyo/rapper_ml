[Verse 1]
Yo te quiero means I love you
Mucho gusto means I'm welcome to you
Señorita, I just want to fall in love
Cállate means close your mouth
Bésame means give me love
Señorita, she just want to fall in love

[Chorus 1]
Baby, hurry up, cause I can't get up
If you like my style, I can love you for a while
Can you hear me call your name?
Baby, I'm over your game

[Verse 2]
Dígame means tell me, baby
Yo soy loco means you drive me crazy
Señorita, I just want to fall in love
Entiendo means I get it
Siempre means that I won't forget it
Señorita, she just want to fall in love

[Chorus 1]
Baby, hurry up because I can't get up
If you like my style, I can love you for a while
Can you hear me call your name? (hear me calling your name)
Baby, I'm under your game (I'm under your game)
I just want to fall in love (hear me calling your name)
Baby, I can't get it enough (come get it)

[Breakdown]
If you do your homework (work)
Baby, I will give you more (work)
Then you do your homework (work)
Get up on the dance floor (work)
If you do your homework (work)
Baby, I will give you more (work)
Then you do your homework (work)
Get up on the dance floor (work)

[Verse 3]
Entiendo means I get it
Siempre means that I won't forget it

[Chorus 2]
Can you hear me call your name? (hear me calling your name)
Baby, I'm under your game (I'm under your game)
I just want to fall in love (hear me calling your name)
Baby, I can't get it enough (I'm under your game)
Can you hear me call your name? (hear me calling your name)
Baby, I'm under your game (I'm under your game)
I just want to fall in love (hear me calling your name)
