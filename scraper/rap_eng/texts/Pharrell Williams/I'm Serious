[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, take a good look at me - now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashin'
Picture me doin' bad even if I wouldn't rappin'
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snappin'
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin' no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A ghetto vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
Nigga picture that, ah matta fact picture T.I.P
Gettin' anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, arrogant son of a bitch
Labelled as anything less than "the shit", I can't see it

[Hook: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pull up in a blue coupe that's damn near clear
And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Piaget wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right c'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss, ball but where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas actin, take ya skirts off
Hoppin bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss
I'm gettin' sick and tired of these phony renditions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision - lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, am I worried?
Are ya kiddin'?

[Hook: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin' gold havin' hoes sweatin' me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organized No-I-Z., and J.D
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin' like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dollars work for clothes, when I go shop
In the Impala on them vogues so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers
And they shows cock, to show shot shit
Bitch, I'm serious

[Hook: Beenie Man]
Dis bad man you get shot, anywhere
Bad man nuh tek back chat, no day
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat, zagga zow
Any bwoy flip dem ago flap - come again
Dis bad man you get shot, any day
Bad man nuh tek back chat, anywhere
Jamaican bad bwoy seh dat - bak
Any bwoy flip dem ago

[Outro: Beenie Man]
Well it's a Neptunes sound (ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Zagga-zagga-za, na-na-na-na-na (T.I.P.)
Whoa na-na-na-na (Beenie Man)
(Zagga-za-za-za, Oh we dat shit)
An a ziggi-ziggi-zagga (Bad man sittin)
Straight from Jamaica (Alright lemme give this to ya)
Alright lemme tell them somethin (See it's goin down)
