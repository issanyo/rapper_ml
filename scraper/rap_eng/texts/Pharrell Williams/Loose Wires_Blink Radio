It's written on your face now
You wanna be my muse
No resume necessary
You're too, too, too adorable
Not be like all the other
(Loose wires)
We have a connection unlike anyone
(Loose wires)
Positive and negatives been undone
(Run for cover)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
(Loose wires)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
Isn't it electric in here?
(Isn't it electric in here?)
I wanna know what it's about
(I wanna know what it's about)
Isn't it amazin' in here?
(Isn't it amazin' in here?)
I wanna know what you're about
(I wanna know what you're about)
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
All the hits that I've been missin'
Been around the world once before
Upside down, right side up lookin' for that one
Ridin' around with glossed over eyes affixed
(Loose wires)
We have a connection unlike anyone
(Loose wires)
Positive and negatives been undone
(Loose wires)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
(Loose wires)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
(Run for cover)
Isn't it electric in here?
(Isn't it electric in here?)
I wanna know what it's about
(I wanna know what it's about)
Isn't it amazin' in here?
(Isn't it amazin' in here?)
I wanna know what you're about
(I wanna know what you're about)
Can't you see the episodes?
The renegades with dirty ways
Dancin' to the break of day
It's tension in here
Can't you see the laser pass
Right through your glass? Don't have to ask
It's green as grass and been passed
It's so thick in here, in here, in here
What's going in here, in here?
Listen to me
(Loose wires)
We have a connection unlike anyone
(Loose wires)
Positive and negatives been undone
(Loose wires)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
(Loose wires)
Put your end on mine and we'll have some fun
(Run for cover)
Isn't it electric in here?
(Isn't it electric in here?)
I wanna know what it's about
(I wanna know what it's about)
Isn't it amazin' in here?
(Isn't it amazin' in here?)
I wanna know what you're about
(I wanna know what you're about)
Isn't it amazin'?
(Isn't it amazin'?)
Isn't it amazin'?
(Isn't it amazin'?)
