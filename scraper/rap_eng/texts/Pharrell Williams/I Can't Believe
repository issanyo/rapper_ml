I would never dream when I go out
(when I go out)
That I'd bump in to you
Dancin' on the floor
(dance on the floor)
I'd bet all my money
There is no doubt
(there is no doubt)
I'm glad I didn't bet cause I'd be broke

Yesterday's gone long gone
We could go thru it
But that won't be right
Let's just move on
Til the morn
Cause there's magic in this building tonight

I can't believe
That it ended up being you and I
I can't believe that this night has just begun
Mi amor
Life is really something else, right
Well I believe
That now it's time for fun

Celebrate with me
Feista baby
Celebrate with me
Feista baby

Sere yo o sera la espera
Warm Miami night 75 the breeze just blows
(The breeze just blows)
Maybe it's the cow bells or the shakers
(The shakers)
Or simply just the combo I don't know

Here we go back again with another opportunity

Yesterday's gone long gone
We could go thru it
But that won't be right
Let's just move on
Til the morn
Cause there's magic in this building tonight

I can't believe
That it ended up being you and I
I can't believe that this night has just begun
Mi amor
Life is really something else, right
Well I believe
That now its time for fun

Celebrate with me
Feista baby
Celebrate with me
Feista baby

So much has happened right
You look good and I've been fine
Let's put it all aside
Away-O
Relays are not my type
But this DJ's got it right
Let's let go and take flight
Away-O
