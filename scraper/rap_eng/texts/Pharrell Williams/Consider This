His name is N.O.R.E. (uh oh)

Yo, yo, yo, it go ways to get the money long time on cash
I'm caught up in the scramble where them guns go blast
If they ya killas then your killas is ass
I'm the world wide hustler
I keep the gats in the muffler
Married the block then broke up with her
Still in the hood still choppin my knicks
And my shots don't miss like Steryakovich
Now my mind clear, I design to stall fear
I'm like Puff and Cous that dudes that I Kia
N.O.R.E. Cali weed I spark three
And bitches say "I'm a friend" like Biz Markie
I get sucked off, I used to buck off
But now I can't do it I go straight up North
So now I just chill and remain a G
Sometimes its no crew just Lone And me
So please let the motherfuckers know who I be
It go

[Noreaga]
Yo, yo, yo I'm on the block buggin, drinkin with my homey (ey yo)
Come her shorty where you goin? (ey yo)
I lay like some semen, drinkin some Henny beamin
Blowin bitches backs out leavin 'em all screamin
I ran wars I divide the plan tours
Fuck these Deuce Bigalow niggas they mad whores
N.O.R.E., dirty, black certy
I'm a Benz drop niggas on I-30
Smack niggas right in they grill
Now stand still, see I stand still
Cause my niggas I stand still
See I lay, lay back, Carniac
And now nigga drink like that and sell rap
It go

All dressed in black, black, black

On a Neptune track, track, track

[Noreaga] - w/ talking in background
Yo, who gonna stop the guard try and rock the guard
On the dance floor frontin, had to drop the guard
Shit D.A.N. - Dead on N.O.R.E
And them little niggas run in the Ville they punk for me
Ain't shit change, still no pot to piss in
When I gotta piss and the pot is missin
Shit, bright and early when I wake up son
Don't front cause I'm the one your boss read I'm from
It go
