Hello everybody my name is Kelis
(Hi Kelis)
The reason that I'm here is my problem got severe

My body would get sweaty whenever he came near
I haven't even hooked an entire year
I've got the fever

I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love

And I can't do my job right because this interferes
And I just want my life back I wanna see shit clear

I was strung out
For real since the first time we hung out
I never met a guy that was even half as fly
I've got the fever

I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love

All my relatives and neighbours would not get out my ear
I would tell them he was cool he just didn't need no beer

I was high n'
Stupid, yeah I was in denial
Every time he smiled at me my mouth would just go dry
I've got the fever

I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
I'm a junkie
A junkie for your love
