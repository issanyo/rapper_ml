[Intro: T.I.]
Ay, and nigga P said he wanted inspiration (Damn P)
I was really more on some "fuck the world" shit so let's see
(Fuck these niggas man, real talk)
I'm a man of respect, man of the people
I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal
Man of respect, man of the people
I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks
And ain't no holding me down, even if you holding the shanks
I'm controlling the time, nigga thinking some things
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank
Sittin' on my throne and my crown, can't separate me from that
I'm king of all I survey, God say be patient for that
Man all I got is my gangster, better not go playing with that
Anything get taken from us, my folk, we takin' it back
Bet we go take us some lives 'fore we go take it to law
Boy I got fire in my eyes, look at me see gauges go off
Watch how you come at your fate, nigga better be saving your thoughts
Boy all you got is a cape, I make the nation go off
And nigga who put fear in your heart? Respect me
Take an act of God 'fore a nigga check me
On his P's and Q's what a nigga best be
Who you got your money on? Bet me, let's see
Who the people want

[Hook: Pharrell]
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue
When your request is denied, bet my demand'll get through
They may be killers to you, hey they my family dude
And anybody could get it, bitch but especially you
These nigga pressin' me, testin', what you suggestin' we do?
And wait a second, push your pawn to play chess with these dude
Yeah we could jump 'em and check em by sprayin' tecs at these fools
Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose
Your bet make yo next move, your best move
Or end up in the pen like the next dude
Remember, there's very few like you they let through
They even fewer, they didn't want in there, they get through
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later
'Less you beat 'em a year later, Boosie tell 'em
Who the people want

[Hook]
When they see you, they might judge you

Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Get T.I. in the Chi, handshake it with 5
Still politicin' with 6 pimp I'm as real as it gets
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity
Say what my pedigree? Solid, gats you talkin' bout, I shot it
Bet you never been to war like I ain't never been to college
C'mon, fuck what you tellin' me, them lies, chill with 'em
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em
Said you coded took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Let them sucka niggas rob you, they ain't kill you but they shoulda
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence
I swear, you and me ain't even fit to compare
I ain't make it all these years on a wing and a prayer
Stare in a bigger nigga eye while he standing right there
Got a problem I'ma handle it right there
Who the people want

[Hook]
