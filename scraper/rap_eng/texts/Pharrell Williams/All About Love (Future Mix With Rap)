[Intro]
Love, uh, It's all about love
Love, uh, It's all about love
Love, uh, It's all about love
Love, uh, It's all about love

[Rap 1: Magnum the Verb Lord aka Pharrell Williams]
Magnum the Verb Lord entering the track
Speaking remedies for the hearts that are sick
Love is a trick as a matter of fact
Through thick and thin, love is still a thing
[?] I know that it does
And is simply something that I can't live without
I feel what I do only because
Being with you is what love is all about

[Verse 1]
You turned my world around
And you brightened up my day
When I'm feeling sad and blue
All I need in my life is you (It's all about love)
Boy, I might not be the best
But you know I'll always try
Now we need to take a chance
If we're gonna make it through this life (It's all about love)

[Chorus]
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)

[Verse 2]
Day seems to be going fast
And the night seem to be shorter, too
It doesn't matter how long it last
Just as long as I'm with you
When I'm feeling all alone
And I feel like can't go on
I know deep inside my heart
There's a better place for me, yeah

[Chorus]
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)

You need love and I need love
Let's share our love to give it up
Spread our love
Spread our love, yeah

[Bridge]
I can't explain how I feel
'cause I never felt like this before
Seems like I'm floating on air
Tell me what's happening to me
C'mon tell me what's happening to me
Love, uh, It's all about love

It's about love, baby
It's about love, sugar

[Outro:]
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
It's all about love (Love, uh, It's all about love)
