[Chorus]
I might come through, pour up ayy
Rep it every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from
12 ride by like every day
We hear sirens every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from


[Verse 1]
Time to put the city up on my shoulder
Where your ass was it when I had Corolla?
Young migo, young migo, drank them Coronas
I'm bout to autograph her areolas
Feeling like Jay-Z, you can't knock the hustle
I'ma get them rings like I was Bill Russell
If you not my brothers then I do not trust you
These my confessions like I sing with Usher
I can't relate to these suckers
Mama told me eat my Brussels
I'm with my team like a huddle
I had to bust out my bubble
Everybody shooters, tell me who tussle
Rosaries, rosaries, I am a blessing
Eating good, I'm going back up for seconds
I come from where you gotta keep protection
Popeyes and Church's in every direction
I'm from the side of town where it might go down
When the po-po comes we don't make no sound
50 shades of grey all up in my cup
Still repping College Park, ain't nothing here new


[Chorus]
I might come through, pour up ayy
Rep it every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from
12 ride by like every day
You hear sirens every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from


[Verse 2]
I just been trying to better me
Stacking money, extra feta cheese
I seen people turn to memories
I seen shirts say "rest in peace"
Stack the bread like it's Sara Lee
Man we make the call, no referee
I know with my dogs, we need pedigree
Better believe, I'm fly like a parakeet
Balling like Matt Barnes
Old school like Capcom
Your gas ain't that strong
Your money ain't that long
You got your facts wrong
You got your facts wrong
She got the MAC on
I'm turning my mack on
They see me with Ralph Lauren
I laid out the platform
I might bring back Phat Farm
Southside yeah where they made me at
Southside turned me to a brainiac
Southside turned me to a maniac
What you sipping? Mainly that
Everywhere we go
Heard she roll, watch her roll
Main street,  on that Clay Co
Gotta stay on your toes

[Chorus]
I might come through, pour up ayy
Rep it every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from
12 ride by like every day
We hear sirens every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from

[Bridge]
I been living every day (like no ma単ana)
Stand around for rainy day (like no ma単ana)
You know Kap G keep that flame (like no ma単ana)
You know I'm Southside born and raised (like no ma単ana)

[Chorus]
I might come through, pour up ayy
Rep it every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from
12 ride by like every day
You hear sirens every day
Southside, southside
Southside, that's where I'm from
