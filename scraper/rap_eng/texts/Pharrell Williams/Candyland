[Verse 1]
When you wake up in the morning
And you stretch and yawn
And you roll all over me (gonna make you)
You can try to avoid it, but it can't be destroyed
When you hear that noise (gonna make you, oh yeah)
When you wake up in the mornin' (gonna make you)
When you get out of the shower (gonna make you)
Try to put on your clothes, think you're ready to go
And you attempt this alone (gonna make you, mmm)

[Chorus]
I hope that doesn't scare you
I hope that doesn't scare you off

[Verse 2]
In my jumpsuits and leotards
I hope that doesn't scare you off
I'm about to come and steal your heart
I hope that doesn't scare you off
Clap your hands everybody
Everybody clap your hands
I'm here to make you move, and share my groove
And spread it across the land
I said clap your hands everybody
Everybody clap your hands
All the guys and girls, welcome to my world
To this Candyland

[Bridge]
Love, angel, music, baby
(Can someone call the fire department? These girls are on fire!)
This shit is fucking bananas

[Verse 1]
When you wake up in the morning
And you stretch and yawn
And you roll all over me (gonna make you)
You can try to avoid it, but it can't be destroyed
When you hear that noise (gonna make you, oh yeah)
When you wake up in the mornin' (gonna make you)
When you get out of the shower (gonna make you)
Try to put on your clothes, think you're ready to go
And you attempt this alone (gonna make you, mmm)

[Chorus]
I hope that doesn't scare you
I hope that doesn't scare you off

[Verse 2]
In my jumpsuits and leotards
I hope that doesn't scare you off
I'm about to come and steal your heart
I hope that doesn't scare you off
Clap your hands everybody
Everybody clap your hands
I'm here to make you move, and share my groove
And spread it across the land
I said clap your hands everybody
Everybody clap your hands
All the guys and girls, welcome to my world
To this Candyland
