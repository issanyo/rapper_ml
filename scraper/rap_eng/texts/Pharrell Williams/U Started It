[Intro]
It's all your fault, but
I'm gonna try

[Verse 1]
I'm feelin' as bad about me as you are
You know I don't wanna be here
I'm tryna work out where these feelings are from
I don't know why I'm doing this either

[Chorus]
I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know, what I'm like
I give in
Even though you started it

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, hey

[Verse 2]
Last time I checked, had it under control
Now everything is unclear
Oh, help me correct it I know that I'm wrong
I don't know why I'm doing this either

[Chorus]
Well, I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know, what I'm like
I give in
Even though you started it

[Bridge]
Oh, well, baby, you were right
Oh, no, no, no, hush, hush
You were right
Forget all about it, baby, you were right
Yeah, we argue sometimes, but please, not tonight

[Interlude - Pharrell Williams]
Hey, you gonna be okay?
(Whoa, oh, oh, hey)
Don't worry about it
Sing...

[Chorus]
I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know, what I'm like
I give in
Even though you started it
I know, you're right, you win
I don't want any part of it
You know, what I'm like
I give in
Even though you started it

[Outro]
Yeah, we argue sometimes, but not tonight, tonight, tonight
