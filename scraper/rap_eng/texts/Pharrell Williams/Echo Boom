[Verse 1: Cris Cab]
The moment we started
The world was a fortress
There were walls to keep us sitting in our place
We were all artists
We painted the brightest
Our creativity is larger than time and space

[Chorus]
The generation of the - let's go, let's go -
We'll conquer everything under the stars
No hesitation when we - echo, echo -
And everybody knows just who we are

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
(I rock Chanel, nigga)
When I was 17 I had dreams like a king
Coming to America but I was just a jerkoff
N.E.R.D. hell yeah I had my shirt off
Oreo-minded I talked to the white bitches
I used to rock Vans, Shea rocked the white sixes
Multi-color fans, we painted the bright pictures
Put the pieces together in that bitch like Lego
Champion sound, now watch them echo
Like my next bro, I remember his dad
Walking in saying this is my son Cris Cab
Cuban loves reggae, does this match?
Closing his eyes playing - I'm like, "This bad."
He got my DNA though it's my first time seeing him
"Welcome to I Am Other!" that's how I greeted him
The new breed, like colorful new weed
We planted them seeds now we got them new leaves
(I don't smoke though)

[Chorus]
The generation of the - let's go, let's go -
We'll conquer everything under the stars
No hesitation when we - echo, echo -
And everybody knows just who we are
