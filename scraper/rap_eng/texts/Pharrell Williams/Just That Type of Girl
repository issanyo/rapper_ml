[Verse 1]
I came to handle business, I'm lookin' at you boy
I'm thinkin' about the things we can do and explore
I'm wonderin if you figure what my body is gonna say and
Tell me what it do, playa, listen, I ain't playin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't bother me with astrology
That is too deep and mental
Me and my girls just came to party
It's that simple
If you need to know, I'm a Virgo
I'm always in my head
That's where you find me
And that's where you wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom to come and go
Dip whenever I please
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl

[Bridge]
You and your boys are fresh in town
Me and my girls is all up in the house, house, house, and out, so what now?
You and your boys are fresh in town
Me and my girls is all up in the house, house, house, and out, so what now?

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't bother me with astrology
That is too deep and mental
Me and my girls just came to party
It's that simple
If you need to know, I'm a Virgo
I'm always in my head
That's where you find me
And that's where you wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom to come and go
Dip whenever I please
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl

[Bridge 2]
I got (I got) what makes a woman irresistible
I am (I am) [?] befo'
It will work if you stay in your place, your place

[Chorus]
I'm just that type of girl
Figured I'd let you know
Lookin' for what I need
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
Freedom to come and go
Dip whenever I please
Tonight I'ma do it for me
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl
I'm just that type of girl

[Bridge]
You and your boys are fresh in town
Me and my girls is all up in the house, house, house, and out, so what now?
You and your boys are fresh in town
Me and my girls is all up in the house, house, house, and out, so what now?
