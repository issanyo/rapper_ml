[Verse 1]
We've been driving for a while and
I guess I got a lot of miles in
But all of those miles came from you
I've seen a lot of valleys and mountains
I've seen a lot of falls and fountains
And no matter the storms, we made it through

You want someone to listen, here's an ear to talk to
You want somewhere to go, here's someone to walk you
You want someone to hug you and you know that they care
You want someone to ask and is always there
A roof over your head and provide you a meal
Who always get [?]
And yes there's ups and downs but this time it ain't you
So you can understand what I'm sayin', can't you?

[Chorus]
He's my bright fire
Oh, yes he is
He's my live wire
Oh, yes he is

[Verse 2]
I can see it in their faces, everybody thinks I'm crazy
Well what am I supposed to do?
This is not a sensation, I've been through all the phases
I gotta say thank you, you brought me through

[Chorus]
He's my bright fire
Oh, yes he is
He took me higher
Oh, yes he did

[Outro]
I feel like a 747, baby
A thousand miles from heaven
Please take me high as you can
I hope we never land
I just wanna share these things, share these things
Share these things with you
I just wanna share these things, the joy you bring
Just wanna share these things with you
