[Verse 1]
I ain't looking at you for no particular reason
It's just a tough spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Gotta get it open
I'ma push my way through, just like a robber
And smile for the camera
Damn, that felt awesome
Push it open little more
Gotta get it open

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

[Verse 2]
I know you're in there; open up, open up
Just like the Feds looking for the stuff
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'ma skip the line
Who cares what happens
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
You would never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject, 'cause, 'cause it's beyond you
And when you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up, and do it on my own

[Chorus]
Hey
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own
Hey
I can do anything, yeah
And I'll do it on my own

[Post-Chorus]
I will get it done with the help from no one
Came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else
We have just begun
So much to do, so young
Don't be afraid of alone
You'll get it done on your own
