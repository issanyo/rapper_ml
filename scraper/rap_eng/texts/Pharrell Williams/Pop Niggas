[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
How many niggas hit the scene like Rule
Bentley GT, pushin' through buck flooded, with jewels?
H-2 with the hungerous wolves beside me
Armed up the army, don't play that with nobody
Rule, Murder & Gotti
We hittin' bitches like Lowe's be hittin' switches, 16 at a time
Times that by how many dimes we lose and find
X'd out and out of they mind, but these are the times of renegades
Prowlin' this bitch with braids
Leather gloves with dark shades and a sawed off gauge
Reminiscin' to Cleo, she go to livin' life flawless
Who's the boss in all this?
It's the GOD, unfortunately
I'm givin' niggas 1 to 3
That means 1 to 3 albums to accomplish what we have built here
You didn't know, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run
Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Y'all niggas wanna see the energy
I'll go at ya like it's a hundred and ten of me
Gun bustin' in every direction, the Public Enemy
But naah I ain't Chuck D, its Rule baby
Y'all niggas wanna get it crazy, come on y'all can't fade me
The music is slavery, roll up and haze me
'Cause most niggas is lazy COTTON PICKERS
Wish they'd find out its me and my niggas they gone
'Cause they prisoners of they own home, we party and get it on
LIVE IT UP! As soon as we hit 'em home
We tuckin' away the chrome and humpin' up on some hoes
We dem niggas you love to hate... I know
Who cares I been blowin' your bitch back out for years
Plus she shed so many tears for me
While you was away, was around the time I made Put It On Me
So homie, stay from 'round here you ain't know, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run
Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, you feelin' hot tonight
Well look it here playboy we could go outside
Yeah, you feelin' hot tonight
Well look it here playboy we could go outside
HUH, you feelin' hot tonight
Well look it here lil' mama we could go outside
HUH, you feelin' hot tonight
Well look it here lil' mama we could go outside

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Certain niggas need to be kissin' the ground that I walk
Shuttin' up when I talk, it's Rule in full floss
5-0 is tellin' him X marks the speasy
How niggas gettin' this money, it can't be this easy
Believe me, I see between cracks and crevices
Angelic and devilish, what gets better than this?
The shell love and angel live in the darkest angles, this is Rule here
I'm cockin' back, I got an idea

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run
Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run

[Bridge 2: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, you feelin' hot tonight
Well lookey here playboy we could go outside
Well lookey here playboy we could go outside
HUH, you feelin' hot tonight
Well lookey here lil' mama we could go outside
Well lookey here playboy we could go outside

[Chorus: Ja Rule]
Just hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop niggas, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop niggas, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run
Hop nigga, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the Rule comin'
Clear the block, niggas, hop nigga, just hop nigga, 'cause I pop niggas
When you see the chrome, run
