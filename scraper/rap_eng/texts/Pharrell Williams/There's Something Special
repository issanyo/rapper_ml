[Chorus]
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Verse 1]
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I only did what was required
I'm a sinner
Sometimes I sat down when I got tired
Should've stayed standing up
To do the job for which I was hired
But the good Lord
Thank you for relighting my fire

[Chorus]
Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Verse 2]
There's a brush fire
TV's watching it escalate
Smoke signals going up (read the signs)
It'll take your breath away
But they don't know how we act now
We'll turn our tomorrow into yesterday
Don't you nest away
C'mon, get dressed ok

[Chorus]
Grab someone you love
There's something special on the other side of this moment
And it's about what you and I decide
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives

[Bridge]
And if it happens to rain on my plans
Water and sweat will dry when they can
Not even cuffs will prevent this man
From the connection between these two hands
You heard me?
Yessir

[Chorus]
And it's important for you to remember we did this together
And finally, they'll know the story of our lives
