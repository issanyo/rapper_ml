[Intro]
Yeah... uh
All the ladies on the floor
Damn right

[Pharrell]
I hate the fact that you know
I hate the fact that you know (why)
I hate the fact that you know, that everywhere you go
They recognize yo' jeans, they recognize a Queen (why)
Everybody runnin but they don't know where to go
There's such a commotion right there on the flo' (dance)
You're spinnin yo' body, the witness makes an O
Well there's one detail that's killin me, I want to know (what)

[Hook]
You just know it, don'tcha know it, don'tcha
No chick got nothin on you
You just know it, don'tcha know it, don'tcha
Cause everything just comes to you

[Interlude]
Ay... cut it out~!
But

[Pharrell]
Where the hell have you been?
Oh where the hell you been? (where)
Where the hell you been, what'cha got yourself in
Baby figure's trouble, came to squeeze me in - ohh!
Everybody runnin but they don't know where to go (ay girl)
There's such a commotion right there on the flo' (want a drink?)
You're spinnin yo' body, the witness makes an O (c'mon)
Well there's one detail that's killin me, I want to know (what)

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
You kissed me, I kissed her
She kissed you, you kissed me

[Over the repeat]
Ohhh! Yes
Where's your drink at girl?

[Repeat 2X]
She kissed me, I kissed her
You kissed you, you kissed me

[Over the repeat]
C'mon you're fakin
Let's fill that up, c'mon
HOLD UP~!

[Shay Haley]
Just got off and I'm tryin to hang
A hole in the wall and my favorite drink
Put a hole in somethin and tear it out the frame
Now who came here to partyyyy?
Get it girl, go on and get wild
What's that dance? I love your style
Animal ass, shorty get wild
But I love how you move your body

[Pharrell]
Everybody runnin but they don't know where to go (stop!)
There's such a commotion right there on the flo'
You're spinnin yo' body, the witness makes an O (hey girl)
Well there's one detail that's killin me, I want to know (c'mere mama)

[Hook]

[Over Hook]
Let's take a shot together
I like your smile
Don't get gassed though, ha
Hahahahaha, yeah
Ay... ahhh!
