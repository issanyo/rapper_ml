[Intro: RockstarTuNE]
RockstarTuNE, GT
I get Wrekless on my mind, man

[Verse 1: RockstarTuNE]
Ten laces on the backyard crack-house
Coat fill of bud crafted pain, nigga chin-chilla
Hundred milla, walk yo' grandmas to the fuckin' dealer
Cross her out, X and O, stiff her like a domino
Oh shit, "geranimo"
Felt the beat like a congo, so
V-Tech timeline mixing life and alpine
Resurrect take your check and spend it on your moms
'Cause yo' daddy couldn't do it, let me splash up in her palms
Pain meets pleasure, but pleasure I never met her
If a nigga comin' foul, I just knit him like a sweater
Lethal measure on a nigga, I ain't really playin' shit
Take the shit, play the shit, treat the game like I'm hiding it
Math time, multiplying shit, but I ain't got time
Jurassic meet the classic, I must be out of my damn mind
Paint a vivid picture, but when the hell do we draw lines
Fear to pull the spine is a crime
Lemon lime sweets, candy coated trick or treats
It's whips galore, bleed bad her ankle sore from the leash
Unleash the beast, grind hard, paper chase
See a nigga swag bark like I had it on a leash
Black stormy weather baffle blows, Mayweather get the chedder
Now I'm laughing to the bank 'cause a nigga knows better
Increase, no decrease McJagger and pain attackers
Peanut planter, I'm trying to get bachelor before I masters
Tarzan, hula-hoop Donald Trump in bathing suits
Fruit loops, match my adrenaline until I'm screw loose
Papoose on the boulevard... Mr. Candyman
How many times can you say my name until I roll 'em; cinnamon
Twisted like a ceiling-fan, I'm trynna make hits like a Dodger can
Morphin power ranger shit minus the jerkin' dance
Killer instinct camel clutch raider ark mask
The rise of a dark knight, Joker asylum school task
Who said I ain't classy? Mental focus is savvy
W-W-E do it big, Bobby Lashley
Five six, black everything fantastic
Until my crew gets signed poof black magic

[Hook: RockstarTuNE]
Wrekless on my mind, I get wrekless all the time (repeat 4x)

[Verse 2: Jet 2]
The game is a lady
They pay me to get her wetter than artificial water missiles
As an artist, I'll be part-official as a Marvel visual
I cap-com, black bombs in the booth
Them other niggas ghost, that's when I chew 'em... Pac-man
Black man, former Dorsey Don
Pull your main here, give her horses' tongue
Corporate funds couldn't sponsor the way I paint out these pictures
Could've swore it was a panorama portrait, huh?
Instrumental coroner; lyrics far from foreigner
Take my dream girl, put her in formation, call it 4-1-1
Man I swear Imma put it down for waiting for the whore to come
Look at here, a patient nigga caking like I'm in the oven baking nigga
Pretty pornography, I Daffy duck-tape it
E&J it meaning I lick her then I chase it with the cake mix like elixir
Vision in the mirror to clear to face it
They're just basic, I'll be ripping through their pages; I'm the scissors
