[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Woke up, I had the same clothes on I had on last night
I must have passed out
And cash is just like the clothes I worn yesterday
We are broke, I gotta get my ass out
I went to see what my friend was talking about
He told me cocaine could get you clout
My momma said he's trouble and school's my route
But I went to high school and got kicked out
So I'm driving this truck down 95
I pray to God I make it home alive
I don't get pulled over by the man
I just want to make it home to hold your hand

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Verse 2]
You say you don't want me to go, but I have to
Please, don't weep, I love you
I refuse to be a bum
Especially coming where I'm from
I'm a provider, girl, and I love you
So it's just like I said before
Heading down 95, dodging Johnny law
I don't need a ticket, though I never got one
If he pulls me over, he gon' feel my shotgun
I think about life, pull down my hat
It's just like this road, I don't know where I'm at
I don't want to be another cocaine story
Will I find my sanity where I find my glory
Come on

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Bridge]
Someday, this will be over
We'll raise a family
I'll get a job, and I'll be a voter
And if I die, it will change you
I'll watch over our family
But only as an angel

So don't tell me you don't know what you see
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me
I'm a provider, girl
I said, don't tell me you don't know what you see
When you're looking at a motherfucker just like me
I'm a rider, girl

[Hook]
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a provider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight
Goodbye, beloved one
Do you know what I am?
If you don't see my face no more
I'm a rider, girl, gotta face the streets tonight

[Outro]
I love you, girl
I'm doing this for us
I don't know any better
What am I supposed to do?
Nothing?
I love you
