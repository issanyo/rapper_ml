[Hook]
Ride that thang…ride that thang
The way she ride that thang…ride that thang
The way she ride that thang…ride that thang
The way she ride that thang…make it hard to concentrate
To concentrate…to concentrate…to concentrate

[Verse 1: Fam-Lay + (Pharrell)]
It’s a firestarter right'chere
If everybody looking, she go harder go right’chere
Sat down her jacket and her purse right’chere
And she went to work like nurse right’chere
If you’re looking for a show (Right’chere)
There ain’t nowhere else for you to go (Right’chere)
The way she ride on that machine (Right’chere)
Baby, you can have your dream (Right’chere)

[Bridge 1: Pharrell]
Well, look yonder, the way she killin’ that flow
(The way I kill it, way I kill it)
She moppin’ up that flo’ (I mop it up, I mop it up)
Ain’t no stoppin’ that hoe (Ain’t no stoppin’ me, boy)
I said look yonder, the way she killin’ that flow
(The way I kill it, way I kill it)
She moppin’ up that flo’ (I mop it up, I mop it up)
Ain’t no stoppin’ that hoe (Ain’t no stoppin’ me, boy)

(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty
(And I can buck) Up, up, up and down, ride that train, shorty

[Verse 2: Fam-Lay + (Pharrell)
She got that lotion and that oil right’chere
I tell you she can make your blood boil right’chere
And it bring the hoe up out her right’chere
That’s why you see a bunch of flying dollars right’chere
The way she look over her shoulder (Right’chere)
She look you in your eyes like she know ya (Right’chere)
You wanna get to know her better (Right’chere)
Now you thinking ‘bout the things you can get her (Right’chere)
