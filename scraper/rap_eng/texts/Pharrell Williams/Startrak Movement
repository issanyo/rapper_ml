Star Trak is in a wonderful place, y'know what I'm sayin'
The Clipse, that situation is being worked out, know what I'm sayin'
That's my motherfuckin' heart right there
Y'know we got Rosco, God bless him
We prayin' for him, and we appreciate all the letters and shit
And all y'all prayers going out to him and his case
It's a crazy messy thing, but y'know what I'm sayin' like
It's just like I told him y'know - I know God ain't bring us this far to drop us off here, so
We 'gon be alright, nigga
