Whats good my g
Actin like you've ever kept it hood with me
Know some that'll put you on the hood
Police never put my hands up will here pull the piece
I have doomed the streets
And I ruined the peace
I'm in the womb of beasts
Lived in the zoo and i consumed the beat
Been awoke for days been alive for weeks
Been deprived of me
Like who am i to be
Simba in a pack we go back far I can see
I mean your eyes can see
Look at my eyes for 3
Its hard to hide i see
Clear as a falcon see
I hear they capped a king
Stay off the balcony
I've seen the past repeat
I've seen them after me
Drew up a masterpiece
Garvey to add the green
Added Malcolm black
Red was out the D
But i was the A walk Abernathy
King was what they named him
My thoughts were blackening
Teeth were in a rapper's neck or round a rappers beat
I pull up to the top i lift up rap with me
Ugh weight man paper weigh it up like 8 times
Pain im paid up lift bars since age nine
And if i kill one more beat with dumb bells
Flex checks and my lexicon the same time
Gold my wrist Tutankhamen with chains on
Hold my nuts acorns and grapes I'm
Born to stunt shoes uncommon i stagedive
Hold em up see these wings it ain't Scott
Come with us Chao Pack with Chaos
Bring wolves out if they bring the k-9s
Earn tomorrow then realize today's mine
And still can't even say everything's fine

[Chorus]
When you broke money lower than its ever been before
Get up
When the streets get cold try out some thing that you never did before
Nigga
If your feet get cold run the city till you over heat the floor
Nigga
My whole team Chao
Turn to tell my niggas that we are close
Nigga We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Apex my team
We gon be alright
Nigga We gon be alright 350 alright
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Apex my team
We gon be alright
EarnYourWings we can be all night
We can dream all night

I see sirens from the booth
Silencing the youth
Never knew the lies among the truth
Open up my eyes to view the news
Riot for the loot
Never seen a night they didn't move
Guidance never proved
To ever guide them to the light i never knew
I can lead em to it
Better than the life these corporations guiding you into
Never had a job I couldn't do
Never had a job where I was locked up in a cube
Boxed in throwin punches in the stu (Fiending)
I was Whitney Houston not a line I couldn't do
I was hittin high notes to the moon
I was Sigmund Freud coming down from thought
I was Downey Jun
I was like a chef Charlie Bartlett with the gauntlet seen syringes in the toilet pushin prisons into school

[Chorus]
When you broke money lower than its ever been before
Get up
When the streets get cold try out some thing that you never did before
Nigga
If your feet get cold run the city till you over heat the floor
Nigga
My whole team Chao
Turn to tell my niggas that we are close
Nigga We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Apex my team
We gon be alright
Nigga We gon be alright 350 alright
We gon be alright
We gon be alright
Apex my team
We gon be alright
EarnYourWings we can be all night
We can dream all night

[Outro]
We gone seize the day and  seize the night
We seize tonight we seize for life
We gone lead the rights they read our rights
Read and write can lead the riots
We gone kill em all and if we die
It's with our pride we boma ye
We gone read about our peoples like
Which one of us gone die today

Till we gone
