[Refrain]
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

[Verse 1]
I, I'm so blind
I never saw you pull that bottle from your jacket lining
Darling, you, you're so fly
But all the makeup in the world can't hide the lies

[Chorus]
Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you're shattering to pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

[Refrain]
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

[Verse 2]
I smile
You wink back
With your Marant Willow sneakers and your backwards hat
Kiss the sky
But you bring back
A hazy cloud that's swirling round you where your head is at

[Chorus]
Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you're shattering to pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

[Refrain]
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

[Bridge]
Around and around
Around and around we go
Around we go
Around and around
Where will we stop
I don't know
I don't know

[Chorus]
Wine glass woman
Wore your Christian Dior
But you're shattering to pieces on the floor
Wine glass woman
See the fire in your eyes
But your victory will be your own demise

[Refrain]
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking

I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love

I know what you're drinking, love
Tell me what you're thinking of
I know what you're drinking, love

[Outro: Skit]
Will you guys just slow it down and make it funky
Like we always wanted it to be?
