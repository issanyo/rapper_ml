[Chorus]
You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward (inward)
To experience the outer space
That was built for you (inward)
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward (inward)
To experience the outer space
That was built for you (inward)
You gotta go inward

[Bridge]
Just picture the love
It's pickin' you up
Your temple should buzz
From the vibration of love

[Verse]
You see I'd rather be a freq than not be unique
Individuality makes life better, yeah
See I'd rather be a freq than not be unique
The individuality makes life better, yeah

[Chorus]
You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward
To experience the outer space
That was built for you
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward (inward)
To experience the outer space
That was built for you (inward)
You gotta go inward

You gotta go inward (inward)
To experience the outer space
That was built for you (inward)
You gotta go inward

[Bridge]
Just picture the love
It's pickin' you up
Your temple should buzz
From the vibration of love
