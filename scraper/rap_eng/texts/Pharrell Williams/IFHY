I never would of thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fall back
For example, ten minutes can go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost latch, the fucking thought of you With somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts. (fuck)
I love you

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good.)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

Girl you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Could make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heat stops beating when your leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it tonight
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling bitch let's try to catch it tonight
C'mon

C'mon baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem I know
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, and we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)
I'm in love (Love)

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

[Wolf:]
Yo, so why is Samuel such a fucking dick?
[Salem:]
He isn't such a badass actually
He's only here because he ran away
Because some shit happened back home
He's actually a dweeb
[Wolf:]
Yo, what...?
