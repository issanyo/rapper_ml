[Verse 1]
Remember back when I had a thing for you, now I don't want no parts of ya
I'm making money, I'm living lavish what's the reason why I need to talk to you
And I know you see me on the big screen, that's why you popped up on my phone screen
You capped up, and you missed out, I'm on a different lane doin' my own thing
Them big diamonds them gold rings, the only reason my phone ringing
You know that well as I do, you wish you could do the things I do
Ever since I touched that Bentley, everybody wanna roll with me
But back then it was acting, now your nigga runnin' the city

[Pre-Hook]
I'm up now, duffle bags in my truck now
Promised mama I'll bring her back home everyday before sun down
Water all on my arm now, suckas mean no harm now
'Cause it's hard for me to look back from where I'm at 'cause I'm on now, I'm on now

[Hook]
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, I'm on now
Suckas finna get worn out 'cause they put the lil nigga on now I'm on now
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, see I'm on now
Suckas finna get worn out 'cause they put the lil nigga on now I'm on now

[Verse 2]
Shoutout to all my fake friends we was never close we just shaked hands
Saw your true colors no spray tans
I can see it clearly no Reaping
See it clearly now
I can see it clearly now
I can see it clearly like the clarity these diamonds in my mouth
And that's real clear, goin' broke that's a real fear
Real fear, just like fear factor that know I'm after these bills here
Tryna figure out how my mama house finna get on these hill here
Tryna get hold of my life like, get a grip like grippin' that steering wheel in that BMW
No you can not see me under rocks, I'm the chosen one spoken from above
I'm fit for this just like a glove, ask anybody they know what's up
My whole life I was prepared for this, moment to say I made it
Imagine being the only one believing in you could make it

[Pre-Hook]
But I'm up now, duffle bags in my truck now
Promised mama I'll bring her back  home everyday before sun down
Water all on my arm now, suckas mean no harm now
'Cause it's hard for me to look back from where I'm at 'cause I'm on now, I'm on now

[Hook]
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, see I'm on now
Yea, I'm on now
Suckas finna get worn out 'cause they put the lil nigga on now I'm on now

[Outro]
Put that lil nigga on now
(?) money
I'm ignoring all messages all snapchats all that
Man I'm new to it but I'm old to it now ya dig
