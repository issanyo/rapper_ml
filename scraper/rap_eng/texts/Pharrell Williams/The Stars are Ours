[Intro]
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey

[Verse 1]
Sister's schoolwork is ready
I was high as a kite
We're gathered around the kitchen table now
And we're coming back to life
Rumor spreads like a virus
Ross' folks' house tonight
We're making plans across the cable now
In the ultraviolet light

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we're breaking all the rules
Cause they're getting in the way
And we'll never be as young as we are today
And they'll claim that I'm a fool
But I look the other way
They can tell me what to do when I'm old and gray

[Chorus]
Now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep
But now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep

[Verse 2]
In the Chrysler LeBaron
White with black leather seats
The trunk is shaking up the neighborhood
As we terrorize the streets
Alan's hand is out the window
Cigarette in his teeth
The neighbors telling us to slow it down
Shake their heads in disbelief

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we're breaking all the rules
Cause they're getting in the way
And we'll never be as young as we are today
And they'll claim that I'm a fool
But I look the other way
They can tell me what to do when I'm old and gray

[Chorus]
Now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep
But now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep

[Bridge]
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey, ho
Hey

[Verse 3]
Champagne toast to the ceiling
Peel the paint off the walls
This one is going in the history books
With the Legends of the Fall
Back in class on a Monday
Mad high-fives in the halls
This one is going in the history books
With the legends of the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we're breaking all the rules
Cause they're getting in the way
And we'll never be as young as we are today
And they'll claim that I'm a fool
But I look the other way
They can tell me what to do when I'm old and gray

[Chorus]
Now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep
But now the stars are ours tonight
We'll worry about tomorrow
When the sun starts shining bright
Then we'll sleep, woo!
