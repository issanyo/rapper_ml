[Verse 1]
You don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Girl, I know you're hurt
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
It really works
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
And let's leave this earth

[Hook]
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
Let's aim high

[Verse 2]
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Damn, that's gotta hurt
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
I know you're worth
So allow me to abduct your mind with these words
Open your eyes, you're now a bird

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
If you just believe that it's true
Please make no mistake, I'll be there too

[Outro]
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
And if you just believe that it's true
Make no mistake, I'll be there too
Let's aim high
