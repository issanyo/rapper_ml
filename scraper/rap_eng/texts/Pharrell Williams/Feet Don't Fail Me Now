Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

It's the rap thespian, trap champion
Dude never lose even when you think he can't even win
Again, don't nobody do it like the kid do
Talkin bout the greatest better throw him on the list too (who)
Way at the top even stopped dreamin even in the offseason I'm steamin (hot)
Hurry up somebody better check our temperature
On the fire titan like the movie they remember us
Plus how can a nigga hate for real when resilience the only thing matchin' my brilliance
Hahaha lol niggas kill me
Look mama no guns and I'm still G
Whoda thought from baker rows center hill he get so much accomplished niggas plot to try to kill me
And keep it real we try yet and still we die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

Yea, sign yours sincerely
I been up on my game, really they just started listening
So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me
And if you're smellin' dro you know that I'm in the vicinity
Flawless with symmetry
Yea, since elementary niggas bite the style like they tryna swap identities
Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory
Now I'm in the club with complimentary Hennessy
But this a jungle so you hear the snakes slitherin'
These niggas fake like a face with no blemishes
So I'm movin' with the force of an olympian
So cold with it you would think that I invented it
Yea, I got a million ways to get it in
All day back and forth like tennis is
Another day at the office to handle business
From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

I heard the tip I won't and shame on they ass
Since the presence is a gift I won't refrain from the past
I'm a young stunner focused and ready to smash
Niggas on that sucka shit boy they really appeared sad
If my feet don't fail me I shall be crowned
But they never failed me before why would they fail now
I'm the one to call on look how they kept it down
Hopin they got the right number I hear the skeptical sounds
I made they ass I'm made to last
Niggas thinking that they on fire I blaze they ass (I mean it)
I'm hopin you see it comparing me to rappers is silly
Them boys stale packin up illys
And all my niggas packin the illy my fraction is gritty we large
The best kush the only reason I'm beggin' your pardon
Cats don't know how to act in the presence of don's
I'm just bein a playa while they bitches enjoyin' my charm

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
