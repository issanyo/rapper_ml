[Verse 1]
I'm a young one
Stuck in the thoughts
Of an old one's head
When all the others were just stirring awake
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well

[Chorus]
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone

[Verse 2]
Guild me, build me
It's your club, so let me in (let me in)
Knowing how heartwarming
It is inside your skin

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well

[Chorus]
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone

[Bridge]
How we're all alone

[Chorus]
Hurry, hurry
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry
Oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you
I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone

[Outro]
Mama
If we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days
We won't sleep for days
Mama
If we pray to the lord
Does he sing on a stage?
Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
I want to get stuck
I want to get stuck
And be golden in your memory
