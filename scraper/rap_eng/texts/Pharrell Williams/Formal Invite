[Verse 1: Ray J]
Yo, we got dirty on the brand new matress
I had you walkin' round with your thong on backwards
I know you felt surprised just how long I lasted
Tellin' all your friends that I'm a nasty bastard
Yo, you know what I like, models and actresses
You know the ones who scream "He loves me not"
You know the ones with the Beamers and them tight ass spots
The ones I see at the beach and be like "Yo, she hot"
Baby pose, let me freeze the frame
You can slide down my pole, let me easy the pain
We can roll on the dubbies in the greasy Range
And throw on a Avirex coat, and play in the rain
And with that body ain't no tellin what I'd do to ya
I'll have you moanin' while I'm groanin'
With that body I can't help but to do ya
And in the mornin' you'll be telephonin' me
Show me the real meanin' of what horny means
While I show you the opposite of what lonely brings
The ice rope on my neck makes my body bling
Flippin' out while you doin' ungodly things
So tell me what'chu doin' tonight
'Cause we can do it again; yo, you with it, a'ight?
Me, I know you like it when I'm feelin' a'ight
And tonight, I'mma make you feel it, a'ight?

[Chorus]
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
It's been a long time since I put Kelis out
I been in VA puttin' them hundred grand beats out
Paying for the all glass-out beach house
So you can see me gettin' head from the hottest piece out
Ex-dyke, Dominican, say they feelin' men again
Askin' me do I wanna sin again
So on my hood, they, screwin' me on
Watch your heels, girls, don't scratch my Louis Vuitton's
I deep dog ya, all day and man
And when I'm in, I touch your chest, ya girl scream alien
She said she feenin' for leaves, so she can't breathe
I don't smoke, but girl I keep bomb ass weed
I change clothes, the same hoes that shop in Mangold's
Gotta pull out my chain slow, 'cause man, that thang rolls
My house, know they can see, got 'em a vacancy
Virginia is my home and my niggas my ADT's
See my two dark, dark knees, and therefore light, light knees
And you never seen a diamond's as bright like these
I don't visit Jacob, my stuff be mailin' us
So what you think you tellin' us?
Mandelbaum is my lawyer so he can better me deals
I shop in Beverly Hills so we can dress and we kill
Watch the E! Channel and see how this rockstar lives
Who the next girl that wanna see this rockstar crib?
Come on...

[Chorus 2X]
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl

[Verse 3: Ray J]
Girl, ain't no need for you to be kinky
You need to leave your man alone 'cause he's broke and wimpy
You need to be with somebody like me
Who can't get married, but I can ice your pinkie
You know, you know, hang out with you
You know, you know, lay down with you
You know, you know, stay down with you
And you can show them other girls what class'll get you, a'ight?

[Chorus 2X]
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl

You should just come home to me...
You should just come home to me, girl

[Chorus]
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl
Girl, what'chu doin' tonight?
This is my formal invite
You should just come home to me, girl
