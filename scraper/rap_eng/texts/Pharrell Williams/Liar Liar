[Verse 1 - Cris Cab]
To the night time, she's burning
Right from the which way she was turning
And I still know the pain
She brought me live one day
She was always somewhere behind me
Thought that was something she was hiding
But now I found the truth
The thing she'll never use!

[Chorus - Cris Cab ft. Pharrell Williams]
Liar, liar, she's on fire
She's waiting there, around the corner
Just a little air, and she'll jump on ya'

[Verse 2 - Cris Cab]
It's a quarter to midnight & she's leaving
Just when she thought I was sleepin'
And I could not believe the things that I had seen
When it was the right time, I caught her
And she was dead in the water
I found her with her tracks
She heard me, answered back

[Chorus - Cris Cab ft. Pharrell Williams]
Liar, liar, she's on fire
She's waiting there, around the corner
Just a little air, and she'll jump on ya'

[Bridge - Cris Cab ft. Pharrell Williams]
Liar, liar, oh oh oh
I need the sun to keep me dry
Liar, liar, oh oh oh
The way you got me swimming through your life
Liar, liar oh oh oh
Keep hearing voices in my mind, saying:
Problem with her lifestyle, she's in denial!

Liar, liar, she's on fire
She's waiting there around the corner
Just a little air, and she'll jump on ya'

[Chorus - Cris Cab ft. Pharrell Williams]
Liar, liar, she's on fire
She's waiting there, around the corner
Just a little air, and she'll jump on ya'
