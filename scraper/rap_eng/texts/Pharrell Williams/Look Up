[Verse 1]
I know, I know, I know
That you're not happy here
You don't need to say it
It shows, it shows, it shows
It's all over your face
You can't erase it, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
There's so much we lack
But something keeps me hanging on
Yeah some feelings they never go, so

[Chorus]
Look up...
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh, yes they do, they do

[Verse 2]
Those words that we don't say
They make the biggest sounds
They call us out, yeah
Cause there are quiet truths and pains
And we both feel them now
But still we love somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish that we could face
The things that hold us back
Before we fade to black
Instead we choose to chase
The things we know won't last
They will never last
But something keeps me hanging on
Yeah some feelings they never go, so

[Chorus]
Look up...
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh, yes they do, they do

[Bridge]
Believe me
I love you in my way
Ooh, what more can I say?
It's constant as the stars
Although we're lost in space
So if separate ways we go
I hope somehow you'll know
Whatever circumstance
You will be in my soul
In my soul


[Chorus]
Look up...
And if the stars should fall from the sky
I will put them all back in time
So you know that when they shine
They shine for you
Oh oh, yes they do, they do
