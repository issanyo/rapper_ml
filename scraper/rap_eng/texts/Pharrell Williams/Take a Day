[Intro: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
One two, ah one two three four (take a day)

[Verse 1: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
All I wanna do is have some fun (take a day)
Two is always gonna be better than one (take a day)
Come and sit with me under the sun (take a day)
Drink some wine until the day is done

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Lemme turn this beat around
Put my feet back on the ground
When the groove begins to play
Makes me wanna... ohhh

[Chorus: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna live my life with no regrets (regrets)
I wanna do some things you won't forget (won't forget)
So dedicated (dedicated), I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Get away with me (get away with me)

The South Pacific has the sun that shines (sun that shines)
Let's stay in the clouds with this glass of wine (glass of wine)
Can you imagine (imagine)
Hope you don't mind me askin'
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Run away with me (run away with me)

[Post-Chorus]
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang, bang, bang, bang
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang
Ah one two, ah one two three four (take a day)

[Verse 2: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
I've been waiting my whole life for this (take a day)
This is my moment, can I steal a kiss (take a day)
24 hours, we can get this done (take a day)
I'd like to start off with some harmless fun

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby let's get to the groove
I can show you my best moves
Make this pressure go away
This time we have got to... ohhh

[Chorus: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna live my life with no regrets (regrets)
I wanna do some things you won't forget (won't forget)
So dedicated (dedicated), I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Get away with me (get away with me)

The South Pacific has the sun that shines (sun that shines)
Let's stay in the clouds with this glass of wine (glass of wine)
Can you imagine (imagine)
Hope you don't mind me askin'
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Get away with me (get away with me)

[Post-Chorus]
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang, bang, bang, bang
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang

[Bridge]
Take a day, take a day
Take a day, take a day
Ah one two, ah one two three four

[Chorus: Madonna + Pharrell Williams]
Don't wanna live my life with no regrets (regrets)
I wanna do some things you won't forget (won't forget)
So dedicated (dedicated), I hope that you can make it
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Get away with me (get away with me)

The South Pacific has the sun that shines (sun that shines)
Let's stay in the clouds with this glass of wine (glass of wine)
Can you imagine (imagine)
Hope you don't mind me askin'
Take a day with me (take a day with me)
Run away with me (run away with me)

[Post-Chorus]
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang, bang, bang, bang
Or we can just bang, bang, bang, bang bang

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
You so nasty!
