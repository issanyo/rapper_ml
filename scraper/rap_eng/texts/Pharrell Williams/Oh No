I bust to the scening cuss to the scening
I admit a little bit I lust for the crideam
Everytime you see me see me biggin up my tiddeam
Wit ha triple biddeam, trying to make griddeen
Thugged out even when you catch me in the cuisine
My clan mad dirty, yall too cliddean (clean)
Hennessey and Smirnoff make a nigga middean (mean)
I need two more like I was a fiddean (fiend)
Drinks galore everytime I'm in the sciddean (scene)
0 to 60 didn't want a sixteening
You see it in my coats or you see it in my jizzeans (jeans)
You can't tell you should know the way I lizzean (lean)
Water so clear I think I'm in Carribbing (Carribbean)
Everybody gone like we straight clipping
You better watch out when we start flipping
It's M.U. nigga and you know we ain't slipping

[Hook] 2x
Ohh Oh No No WHAT WHAT WHAT

Ayo verse 2 coming with my Heineken brew
N O R putting people back in I C U
You ain't even thiddink that I need a driddink
Hit you up quick before you could even bliddink
Give you a spiddank, cut you up with the shiddank
Tell your accountant to go and just check the biddank
I damn near broke you and I ain't even thiddink
I gotta Trailer Load a' Girls like Shabba Riddanks
Guaranteed to be there just like Fed Ex
We write our own rhymes kid you can check the credits
Me and Nature stay fuckin with grimlettes
Yo the hood baddest the bitches ass is the fattest
Smack Smack Smack Smack peep Gladys
If you don't know yo then I don't know
I'm gonna get me some head, nigga, after the show
You can meet me at the room, nigga - 664

I told y'all flippers, all of y'all critters
Don't be contemplating my figures
Cause I hang with go getters, straight flow spitters
Cris' and Moe' sippers carry yo niggas

[Noreaga]
It's all goonud do my songs for the hoonud
Platinum nigga while yall thangs go woonud
Yo you try to dis me? Your man told you that you shoulnud?
I blew over you and I told you that I couldnud
Me and Drag pack it Neptunes on the wheels
Clue?'s sneakin' in tables and he's sneakin in steels
People walkin in my section that I don't even know
I'm like "Get lost, ay you stank-ass ho!"
Use your finneet, always see you in the strinneet
Walkin walkin til you get winneak
You on the E train, 7 train plus the bus
I don't even like you cuz you can't be trust
You need to get up out my face ain't nuttin to discuss
You don't like me then cool yo I don't care
But if you get up in my face yo I don't care
It's a dirty game and both of us ain't playin it fair
