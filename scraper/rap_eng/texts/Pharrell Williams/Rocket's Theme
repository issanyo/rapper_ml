[Chorus]
Did you read the paper? They'll be coming for us soon
Come on Rocket, we're going to the moon
We could shoot for the sun, but that'd be too soon
So one step at a time. Let's get the moon

[Verse 1]
Since you were a thought
Floating around in our minds
We knew that you could teach us the true meaning of life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is to try without fire and blast through all our fears
You can fly so much higher and take us all from here

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You could not be bought boy
You'd be sold out all the time
Who wouldn't queue and long for
The vital meaning of life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Which is to ride heart and mind and learn along the way
Find our stride inside with no turbulence or sway

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're the one I promise you
Love is your rocket fuel
Nothing is stopping you
You're special
Keep climbing impossible
A thousands of altitude
Isn't that what God will do
You're special

[Chorus](2x)
