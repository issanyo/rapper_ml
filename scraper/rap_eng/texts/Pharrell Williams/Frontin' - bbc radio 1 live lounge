[Verse 1]
Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude
But you ain't looking at no other dudes
Cause you love me
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe cause you love me (Woah, woah)

[Hook]
So when we tried, things would slow down
Because you weren't used to how fast we touch
Then we locked eyes, and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear your ass up

[Chorus]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' you know I want you babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want you
You should stop frontin' baabe
(ay ay aay, yeah yeah yaay, yeah yea yaay)

[Verse 2]
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But you still sneak and you look at me, girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa)

[Hook]
So then we tried, things would slow down
Because you weren't used to how fast we touch
Then we locked eyes, and I knew I was in there
And I was gonna tear ya ass up

[Chorus]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' you know I want you babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
You know I want you
You should stop frontin' baabe
(ay ay aay ay, yeah yeah yaay, yeah yea yaay aaay)

[Musical Solo]

(oh oo oo, mm mm mm)

[Chorus/Outro]
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' you know I want you babe
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
You know I want you
You should stop frontin' baaaaabe
(woah oh oh, yeah  woah oh oh, yeah aay yeaaaah ay ay ay yeah ay ay ay, yeaah mm mm mm)
