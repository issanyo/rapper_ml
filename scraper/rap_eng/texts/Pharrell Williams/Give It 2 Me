[Verse 1: Madonna]
What are you waiting for?
Nobody's gonna show you how
Why work for someone else to do what you can do right now?
Got no boundaries and no limits
If there's excitement, put me in it
If it's against the law, arrest me
If you can handle it, undress me

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2: Madonna]
They say that a good thing never lasts
And then it has to fall
Those are the people that did not amount to much at all
Gimme the baseline, and I'll shake it
Gimme a record, and I'll break it
There's no beginning and no ending
Give me a chance to go, and I'll take it

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now

[Bridge: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
(Watch this...)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (what?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (what?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (what?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it (what?)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it
(To the left, to the right, to the left, to the right)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it
(To the left, to the right, to the left, to the right)
Get stupid, get stupid, get stupid, don't stop it
(To the left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right)
Get stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid...
(Left, left, right, right, left, left, right, right)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Don't stop me now, don't need to catch my breath
I can go on, and on, and on
When the lights go down and there's no one left
I can go on, and on, and on

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now

[Breakdown: Madonna]
You're only here to win
Get what they say?
You're only here to win
Get what they do?
They'd do it too if they were you
You done it all before, it ain’t nothing new
You're only here to win
Get what they say?
You're only here to win
Get what they do?
They'd do it too if they were you
You done it all before, it ain’t nothing new

[Chorus: Madonna]
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna show me how
Give it to me, yeah!
No one's gonna stop me now
Give it to me
