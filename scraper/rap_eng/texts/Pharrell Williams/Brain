[Intro]
What do you think baby

[Verse 1]
I know I want you
And you know you want me
But can you promise please
You'll say yes to me
I love how you think
You think oh so deep
And share your thoughts with me
I buzz then fall asleep

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain

[Verse 2]
Girl unlatch your bra
But first unlatch your jaw
It's cool to call me dog
But your head is under my paw
Soon as your lips part
Then your tongue it starts
My pulse just races hard
Enough to pop my heart
I'm so high

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain

[Bridge]
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Hey, huh, hey, what?
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Yeah, hands up, if you feel like that
Hey, huh, hey, what?

[Verse 3]
The things you think on me
The games you play on me
And stay the day on me
The words you say on me
When we party hop
Bathroom countertop
Or in your old man's truck
Grocery parking lot

[Hook]
Do you really even love me
If you do there is no pain
Do I really even love you
Or do I really love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain
I just love your brain, brain
