Ever seen me on some ape shit
This is Jay that Beyonce hit
This that Weston road Drizzy knows
New single yeah I make those everyday
I'm bout to go Bazerk today
Like I lost the girl of my dreams
I just met a new one today
Heard me rap now she know the name
Yeah
She just took one for the team
She heard that verse somebody tell Queen Bee I got one for her
I may lay a whole song down for the queen
Most of these niggarz ain't my league
Of all the meds now I'm just high on life
Gimme the checks imma sign em now
I see Leqx got no complaints
The 1NE on a new status
Stunner Still getting Paid
I know I'm late I was getting head
You can't complain you in the presence of a real Stunner
I don't want any compliments
I just wanna sell concert tickets
Now Get off my dick
Put on Respek on my name

Yeah

Can't believe we made it
This is what we came for

Ever seen a crowd going ape shit

Crazy how shit changed
One minute I'm Cliff the next I'm Rick James
Eiybody break a leg
I might need to make a rest
Jay on expensive painting talk
Ye on Crazy shoes i wonder how he walk
Still scheming Jay walkin crazy
Running and running all around you all
Miss me all of that chatty party though
You came to smash oow this a tea party whore
Hit me when you wanna party with the real Stunner
All of the ladies I'm with wearing prada
I got the crowd going ape shit

Yeah
