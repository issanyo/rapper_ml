[Pharell]
So she tells her man:
"Let's go fishin'"
We'll go tommorow morning when the sun rise...
And then she says she wants to take her kids and (*baby crying*)
That's her boy that's 12 and her daughter that's 4 with angel eyes
So they get there...
And the sun has barely risen
Decided on a spot where the fish is plentiful with the tide
Get out their poles
Daddy smiles and said the fish is jumpin'
Then they heard a splash but it sounded bigger than fish size

12 year old screams: "Mom!!!"
And Mom screams back:
"The baby was holdin' your arm"
Well, that was 30 seconds ago
So they jumped in
All comin' up with nothin'
But then...

Something told mom
To look toward the light
But the sun wasn't yellow
It had turned white
So she listen and swam
She swam for the light
Like the Michelin Man
She swam with such might

She spotted the baby
And she was on her back
Just as the light said "Sunrise was Heaven's track"
She turned the baby over
Her eyes were still blue
Baby had a smile and said...

"I was waitin' for you!"
Mom, I was waitin' for you!!!
Your baby!!
Momma!
I love you!
And I was waitin for you!
(Hey!)

I was waitin' for you..
I was waitin' for you..
Momma...
I was waitin' for you..
I love you ma...
