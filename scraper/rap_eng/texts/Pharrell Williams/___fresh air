[Verse 1]
Baby girl, you put me in a choke hold
You so stunning like Stone Cold
You always hit me on the phone when I'm never ready
I don't dream anymore, I just think of you
Wide awake in my bed and it's ten past two
I would sleep if my head and heart would let me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm strung up and I'm not coming down
Got your image in my brain and I can't get it out, you
Got me thinking I got something to prove, but
Girl you ain't got nothing to lose

(thebreathingbackwards)
Skrrt

[Chorus]
Make you feel like the first time
You ever saw me
I'll be the fresh air
In your lungs
Make you
Feel like you're falling again
Til the summer's end

[Verse 2]
Chase the cheddar like I'm Stuart Little
Got the homies on my shoulders, I keep you in the middle
You're the reason I'm awake at the crack of sunrise
I've been grinding like I'm Otto Rocket
Had a lot of love then I thought I lost it
But girl I found it in the green in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm strung up and I'm not coming down
Got your image in my brain and I can't get it out, you
Got me thinking I got something to prove, but
Girl you ain't got nothing to lose

(thebreathingbackwards)
Woo

[Chorus]
Make you feel like the first time
You ever saw me
I'll be the fresh air
In your lungs
Make you
Feel like you're falling again
Til the summer's end
