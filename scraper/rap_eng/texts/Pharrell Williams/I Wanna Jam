[Intro]
Let's be rebellious baby

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
No turnin' back now
I'm already sold on it
You came and convinced me
I wanna get this over with
Thank God the teenagers takin' over the world
And all you old school niggas should just go fishing for pearls

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight
Life makes me horny

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
They talk about yesterday
But I'm just thinkin 'bout tonight
Don't take it no kind of way
But I just wanna dance alright
Thank God the teenagers takin' over the world
And all you yesterday people should stay in your bed and curl

[Pre-Chorus]
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight (Haha, yeah)
Life makes me horny (Uh, damn right)

[Verse 3: Shay Haley]
I am a ten-to-five
I am a happy dryer
Your uphill makes my mouth dry
C'mon let's wash saliva
Don't you wanna feel some love
Everybody is high on drugs
Got problems with some wookie
I am the nookie piper

[Pharrell Williams]
Thank God the teenagers takin over the world
And when you open up your eyes I hope you old fucks just hurl

[Pre-Chorus]
Look here
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
You ain't seen nothin yet
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
I came to sweat
Well get on up and jam y'all

[Chorus]
I came to jam tonight
And I came to party
Well I come to jam tonight
Life makes me horny
