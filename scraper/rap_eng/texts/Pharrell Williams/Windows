[Intro]
Uh-oh!

[Verse 1]
Every single night I'm starin in her window
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
She's fresh in a towel and the lights are dimmed low
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
If you seen, what I've seen, she's a ten yo
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin in her window
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin' in her window!

Uh-oh!

[Verse 2]
My best friend said I shouldn't do this no more
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
Well I guess that means I'm very different from my friends so
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
Cause you've seen, what I've seen, she's a ten yo
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin in her window
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
You would be (ahhhhh) starin' in her window!

Uh-oh!

[Interlude - repeat 2X]
Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow!

[Verse 3]
Look at her, she's my medicine
In those magazines, and all that estrogen
I bet she'd like me, but my conscious says to guess again
If she ever did, I would be ready then
The best time to watch is like 1 or 2 o'clock
In my fuckin world she can come over and rock
I wonder if she'll be down with it a lot
She's taking off her clothes, and 'bout to close the win-dow

Uh-oh!

[Verse 4]
She's like the Bill to my Gates that was entitled Windows
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
She said "Don't go Microsoft, you like it when I bend low" (Don'tcha, don'tcha)
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
I said I see, what you mean, cause that's my twin-doh
(Win-dow-dow-dow, dow da dow)
And uhh, we see you starin in our windows
(The eyes are the win-dows to the soul)
Damn~! They caught me starin' in her window!

[Outro]
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh-wha-ho!
Yeah
Oh no
