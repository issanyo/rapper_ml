[Intro]
One more time, I gotta tell you now
One more time, tell you

[Verse 1]
We've been down together for so long
Solid and strong
The lights went on
Wasn't your memory you forgot about
When you were down and out
You left dirt in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now

[Verse 2]
If I gotta do it alone, I will
Roll this boulder up this hill
Roll up my sleeves, no chill
Be rolling, you can sit still
More like family there were no bounds
We used to ride towns
And burn them all down

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)

[Bridge]
Like most all of the snowglobe
Distracted and confused
Gotta make yo' mind up
This is yours to lose
Things will always pop up
Like snowflakes they will move
I know that sounds real cold, but
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

[Verse 3]
Can't tell what two dudes not allow
You don't like crowds
But you gotta get out
You could change the world if you change your route
You gotta leave your house
Go outside out

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're probably saying "G"
I know you said it but woah, woah, woah
'Cause you really didn't believe
You didn't think that we would go, go, go

[Chorus]
Well, don't you know what they say about the show?
Well, even if you don't play, it must go on
You have decided to stay, you wanna be home
But don't take it no way, me and my bros
We just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, we just got to do it (do it)
Do it (do it) do it (do it) do it (he-ya)
One more time, gotta tell you now
