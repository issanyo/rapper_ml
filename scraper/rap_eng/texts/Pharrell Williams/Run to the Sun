[Intro]
Before you go
I wanna talk to you

[Verse 1]
Thinking about the time we share
And how I wasn't there
It hurts me
These people overwork me
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave
Excuse me lord if you have tricks up your sleeve
I'm not ready to be bereaved
I know I'm always asking for something
Or another
But this time, it's just time
Cause I love her
But baby if he don't change his mind
Or fate or time
Yo I want to leave you with this line

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I tied two rocks together
That symbolize our lives
And threw them in the ocean
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
'Til they stop rollin' so far
That no sonar would list them
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
I know that may sound twisted
But my neglect is killin' me
I feel so guilty
Please have faith if you feel me

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Though you're probably feelin' blue
And you'll do what you must do
I hope you know
I'd hand the skies to you
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
They're so stupid
Do they not know you're about to fly high
Away
With the wings that God will give you someday
I'm not jealous
I just can't take it
S.O.S. to your ears
The only thing I ever feared was this day
And having to say

[Hook]
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I want to tell you something
It's that I love you girl
