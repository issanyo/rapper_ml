[Verse 1]
You had your dreams
And I had mine
Wide open when we dream together
No idea how we keep our shit together

[Bridge]
Wondering
Is this love or illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

[Hook]
It's nuclear
With you here
There's nowhere left to run
Why run? Why would you run?
It's nucler
We're two here
We both heat up

Goin all the way (eh eh)
Goin all the way (eh eh)
Goin all the way (eh eh)
Goin all the way (eh eh)

[Verse 2]
You had your half
And I had mine
But now there's no such thing
As you and me
I was so used to feeling incomplete

[Bridge]
Wondering
Is this Love or illusion
We're just getting better
When the two become one
On a quantum level

[Hook]

Goin all the way (eh eh) x4

[Verse 3]
Anytime the climates change between us
We share a bond they can't restrict
That can't be touched
So amazing super power
Take over
Never lose the energy

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Goin all the way (eh eh) x4
