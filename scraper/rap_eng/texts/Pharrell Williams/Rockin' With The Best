A-come on, two-step, uh, yeah
A-come on, two-step, uh, yeah
A-now let's work, ha-ha, AH-HEEEH~!

We can do it up, just the two of us
Me and you shorty, we don't need the crew with us
You know my hammer large, I'm the man in charge
I like your Louie bag, the Monty Grammer flange
A little zif and dale, a little ace of spade
I'mma roll the purp' up, let you taste the haze
You know I gotta thug it, Olympic size swimming pool
With the mosaic towels at the bottom of it
You could spin and keep spinning, I ain't got a budget
I can put enough away and I ain't gotta touch it
Don't worry about nothing, Kiss got it covered
You now rocking with the best girl, gotta love it

[Hook: Bobby V] + (Jadakiss)
Girl (two steppin with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two steppin with my gangsta self)
You're now rocking with the best of both worlds (you're now rocking with the best; you don't need no help)
Girl (two steppin with my gangsta self)
Oh girl (two steppin with my gangsta self)
You're now rocking with the best of both, girl (you're now rocking with the best; you don't need no help)

[Jadakiss]
When you're at the top, there's no stopping it
Take a second realize who you're rocking with
Just noticed the color car that you're shopping with
Take pride in the joint when you're mopping it
Kiss melts in your mouth like chocolate
Make sure it's hot whenever you're dropping it
Right now we got billionaire guap to get
You ain't in the boys club, you just copped the fifth
I'm two-stepping in, honey popping in
Your first was the worst now it's the opposite
Yes, I must confess girl
You're now rocking with the best, girl

[Pharrell]
Get your glass up, cause I'm back again
What it do shorty? What's happening?
You know this beats jamming, it's remarkable
Everybody looking, what you gonna do?

[Bobby V] + (Pharrell)
Now move closer for the (kid) one time
Closer for the (kid) one time
Closer for the (kid) one time
(Back that ass on the kid) one time
Now drop it like you do it for the (East) one time
Drop it like you do it for the (West) two times
Drop it like you do it for the (North) three times
Drop it like you do it for the (South) girl

[Jadakiss]
We could stay around here, we could take a trip
I take you to the block show you how I make it flip
And it's finished so fast cause I make it quick
All I ever knew how to do is make it sick
Pop another bottle ma, let's take a sip
Close your eyes, blow the candles out, make a wish
And just forget about the rest of 'em
Cause you're rocking with the best of 'em
