[Intro]
How sick is this?
How sick is this?
You know, you know, you wanna call me back
You know, you know, you wanna call me back
You know, you know, you wanna call me back, oh

[Chorus]
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I finally get you on the phone and our connection's all wrong
You're acting like I'm starving you out, and my battery's getting low
Get me charged up or you will regret it
I need to call you back so I can hear you better
About to end the conversation altogether, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Come on, give a little love
Why aren't you calling me back?
Okay, now gonna call you at home, and leave another sorry message
Why does it have to get so complicated?
Acting so cold, refrigerated
You've got your voicemail on I'm so frustrated, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I hate it when the signal drops on my cell phone
I'm just trying to talk, but my bars are all gone
I'm not in the mood for your stupid ringtones
I want my battery charged and I want you in my zone

[Chorus]
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think you're cutting out
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Hold up, I think I'm losing you
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
Tell me, can you hear me now?
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
We're breaking up, oh-oh-oh
