Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go skinny dippin'
Just like we did before
Stars are out to shine
The moon is hanging on
In the dark no one will ever know
Come with me, run with me down to the sea
Worry 'bout nothing, have fun with the beat
Toes in the sand, and we're feeling the breeze
Ain't nothing better than feeling this free
Kiss me now, and girl come on let's go

Come on baby, it's been so long
Since we've done something that might be wrong
Ain't no one left inside
Let's skinny dip tonight

Give me one just sip till we both feel alright
Let your inner ambitions slip on outside
I'll pull you closer and keep you warm at night
Come with me, run with me down to the sea
Worry 'bout nothing, have fun with the beat
Toes in the sand, and we're feeling the breeze
Ain't nothing better than feeling this free
Kiss me now, and girl come on let's go

Come on baby, it's been so long
Since we've done something that might be wrong
Ain't no one left inside
Let's skinny dip tonight
Let's skinny dip tonight

Come with me, run with me down to the sea
Worry 'bout nothing, have fun with the beat
Toes in the sand, and we're feeling the breeze
Ain't nothing better than feeling this free
Kiss me now, and girl come on let's go

Come on baby, it's been so long
Since we've done something that might be wrong
Ain't no one left inside
Let's skinny dip tonight
Come on baby, it's been so long
Since we've done something that might be wrong
Ain't no one left inside
Let's skinny dip tonight

Let's skinny dip tonight
