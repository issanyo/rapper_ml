[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I'm doing everything right, stepping into the light
That's what I've been waiting for
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I've got your hand in mine
We're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for

[Verse 1]
In the dust, burning Sun
Need the rain, let it come
Oh we pray, come for me
We pray, let it rain

[Refrain]
Hey, all my sisters and brothers
Hey, one foot in front of the other
Hey, all of the darkness ending
Hey, I see a new beginning

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I'm doing everything right, stepping into the light
That's what I've been waiting for
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I've got your hand in mine
We're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for

[Verse 2]
There's a sign through the haze
There's a will, there's a way
Oh we pray, everyday
We pray, oh we pray

[Refrain]
Hey, all my sisters and brothers
Hey, one foot in front of the other
Hey, all of the darkness ending
Hey, I see a new beginning

[Chorus]
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I'm doing everything right, stepping into the light
That's what I've been waiting for
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I think it's gonna be one of those days
I've got your hand in mine
We're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for

[Bridge]
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Refrain]
Hey, all my sisters and brothers
Hey, one foot in front of the other
Hey, all of the darkness ending
Hey, I see a new beginning
