[Chorus]
See see... (x4)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Beauty is not hard to define
It is there inside
When you open your eyes
Hey, don't be blind, be open to see
Could she be the girl to help me see
See the world?

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams] (x9)
(See see..)
The world

[Verse 2: Cara Delevingne](Pharrell Williams)
Beauty is not hard to define
It is there inside
When you open your eyes
Hey, don't be blind, be open to see
Could she be the girl to help you see (to help you see)
See the world?

[Chorus: Cara Delevingne] (x8)
(See see...)
The world
