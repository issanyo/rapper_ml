[Verse 1:]
Listen shawty I'ma tell you how it go
Quarter ki', seven G's
Anybody want it tell 'em pull up on me at the store
.45 in my jeans, super clean
You ain't never seen a nigga like this
Sun shinin on my wrist
Couple dimes in the whip, give a damn 'bout a bitch
Huh, but I will take yours if I wanna
You a sucker, you ain't goin' do shit
But just run yo' mouth
Be in front of yo' house with them goons, bet you won't come out
And you a scary ass nigga
Hold these, your homeboy to the Fed ass nigga
Hey I'm certified, better recognize
Fore you end up a dead ass nigga
I got a check, you can tell how my neck is shinin'
Tell 'em

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
This life we live we do not care
If you at your momma house we'll have a shootout there
Hey, ain't gon' be no playin with the crew out there
Them animals on the loose and it's a zoo out there
Out here rollin where you at, we'll move out there
Network in no time, get a few out there
I got the chopper at the do', "Shawty who out there?
Aight, get your fuckin brain blew out now!"
Now I ain't playin where I stay, to take a life ain't shit
Get murked for a brick if your wife ain't shit
Bankrolls are us, we'll buy that shit
I keep it on me homie, rob and I will try that shit
Man you can ask about Tip on Simpson Road
We was ridin in the city; really gettin busy
Now a nigga wanna kick it like some thugs in the city
When they really wasn't sellin any drugs in the city
For real

[Hook:]

[Bridge:Tameka "Tiny" Harris]
What you want we got for you (hey, we got it)

Wonder why we shut your door
You're not from here, do not go through

[Verse 3]:

How many times I done showed you this?
In the trap run a chick through the roof right now

Pick the rap with your bitch in the coupe right now
And I know you pissed
How many times I done told you this?

You can't do shit 'bout it, this life we 'bout it

You can't do shit 'bout it, can't do shit 'bout it
Ha ha, ay
