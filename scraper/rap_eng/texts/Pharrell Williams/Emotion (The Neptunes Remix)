[Intro]
This (This), is for the old school playas, huh
The old school playas
The old school playas

[Verse 1]
It's over and done (Remix)
But the heartache lives on inside (aaaaahhhhh)
And who's the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight? (tonight)

[Pre-Chorus]
(And where are you now) Now that I need you?
(Tears on my pillow) Wherever you go
(I'll cry me a river) That leads to your ocean (To your ocean)
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

[Chorus]
It's just emotions taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world
To hold me tight
Don't cha know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight (Kiss goodnight)
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight

[Verse 2]
I'm here at your side
A part of all the things you are
And you've got a part of someone else
You got to go find your shining star

[Pre-Chorus]
(And where are you now) Now that I need you?
(Tears on my pillow) Wherever you go
(I'll cry me a river) That leads to your ocean (To your ocean)
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

[Chorus]
It's just emotions taken me over
(I'm tryin' hard but I can't stop cryin')
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
(Inside this lonely heart, I'm so excited)
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling (Come home, come home, come home)
Don't you know there's nobody left in this world
To hold me tight (Nobody to hold me)
Don't cha know there's nobody left in this world
To kiss goodnight (Nobody to say to me)
Goodnight

[Pre-Chorus]
(And where are you now) Now that I need you?
(Tears on my pillow) Wherever you go
(I'll cry me a river) That leads to your ocean (To your ocean)
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart

[Chorus]
It's just emotions taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling (Don't you know that)
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight (Nobody to kiss me)
Goodnight, goodnight (Goodni-i-i-i-ght)
