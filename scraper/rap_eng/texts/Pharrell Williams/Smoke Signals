[Intro]
Westside, Westide, Westside

[Chorus]
I'm sending out smoke signals
And I'm sure you can see them, Westcoast
Come chief for me girl
Lets Smoke, we'll be hanging out up in the clouds
There's no way that we can come down
Go, come chief with girl
We can have a ball

[Bridge 2x]
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball

[Verse 1]
Ridin' around with the top down with a fine dime
And she told me to roll up, Hey, she like "Yo" let's go
Let the games begin what's the hold up, Hey
I say girl, slow down when the sun go down
We can go up
And I put that on mom, when i light up the spaam
Better blow up, and first informally, most importantly
I think that we should have a toast
According to you cause we do?
The number one cutie everytime you roll a doobie
And look, I'm feeling the feather
You're wearing your hat right, you said you was single
Why won't you make it a pair?
Call your home girl TT, the one with the GG's
Just set up the TP for a week three

[Chorus]
I'm sending out smoke signals
And I'm sure you can see them, Westcoast
Come chief for me girl
Lets Smoke, we'll be hanging out up in the clouds
There's no way that we can come down
Go, come chief with girl
We can have a ball

[Bridge 2x]
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball

[Verse 2]
Hanging out in the back house with a couple girls
Turnt up with the homies, Hey Do It baby
Break it down for ya boy
I can tell that she want me, Hey
She would brag 'bout the blunts that she roll
So I told her to show me, Hey
So I'm already goin' in the moment
I'm about to get the chonies, Hey
The chick with the J on her lips
Got a bong, proceeded into taking a rip
Blew an O, just to let her know
That she's willing to roll
Baby, come home we can take a dip
Trust me, Trust me, Trust me
We can go wherever you want
Baby, please don;t rush me, Nine times out of ten, baby
You got a ten, If you down to put it in we can get it in

[Chorus]
I'm sending out smoke signals
And I'm sure you can see them, Westcoast
Come chief for me girl
Lets Smoke, we'll be hanging out up in the clouds
There's no way that we can come down
Go, come chief with girl
We can have a ball

[Bridge 2x]
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball
You take me high
Ball, we gon' have a ball

[Outro]
Break it down, Break it down
Break it down, down, down, Hey
Break it down, Break it down
Break it down, down down, Hey
