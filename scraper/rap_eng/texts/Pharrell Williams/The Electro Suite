Something's Happening
Mind destructing, Agony Inside Of Me
My Pulse Is Racing
Mental Torture, Self Destroyer
Can't Ignore the Paranoia

Something's Happening
Mind destructing, Agony Inside Of Me
My Pulse Is Racing
Mental Torture, Self Destroyer
Can't Ignore the Paranoia

Mind is aching, Body's racing
Pulse is shaky, Madness breaking
I can feel the darkness taking over

Denying
The rising
The crying
I'm dying

He lied to me
He shot at me
He hates on me

He lied to me
He shot at me
He hates on me
He's using me
Fragility
Electricity
Afraid of me
He's dead to me

He lied to me
He shot at me
He hates on me
He's using me
He's dead to me
He is my enemy

They lied to me
They shot at me
They hate on me
They're using me
Afraid of me
They're dead to me

They lied to me
They shot at me
They hate on me
They're dead to me
And now they're all my enemy
