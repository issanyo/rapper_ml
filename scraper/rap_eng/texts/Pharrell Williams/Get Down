[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch (Ross)
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at—

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch
The whole crew getting down in this bitch
Yellow music worn blue, getting down in this bitch
Yes I want (what you wanna do?)
I want (what you wanna do?)
Get down twice (what you wanna do?)
And then let's roll (what you wanna do?)
Yessir

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You so bad, you so fine
You make a nigga get mad all the time
I love a bitch who magnetic money
Hit it from the back, just to look at her
Look at her, damn she married
I didn't ask her [?] or two carats
Big timer, I'm buying her
Designer, Great Wall of China
All kind of big diamonds
Her ass look great when it is grinding
On time and she fine as
Any dime you can find on this island
She mine though, [?]
Got some head and I quick leaved the condo
Her dad know it's mine now, he mind though
I'm the man though, and now her damn mom know

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch
The whole crew getting down in this bitch
Yellow music worn blue, getting down in this bitch
Yes I want (what you wanna do?)
I want (what you wanna do?)
Get down twice (what you wanna do?)
And then let's roll (what you wanna do?)
Yessir

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Huh, how you do that there?
You need room, mami, move that chair
How the watch so blue, that rare?
Man, I told y'all Ice Cream, mami, two that pair
G4 so fast, man, it move that air
They like "there he go"—What? Who that? Where?
You see nothing but a blur
The smoke same colour as a chinchilla fur
Call a nigga Ben-Hur
My bitch Liz Taylor, man, she look like her
Plus my nigga Big Ben right thurr
Just in case some big beef occur
From N*E*R*D or you can say "nerd"
I got a skate team and it's lead by Ter
You wanna meet with me? Well don't say "sure"
If you know me well then you say "yessir"

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch
The whole crew getting down in this bitch
Yellow music worn blue, getting down in this bitch
Yes I want (what you wanna do?)
I want (what you wanna do?)
Get down twice (what you wanna do?)
And then let's roll (what you wanna do?)
Yessir

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm sticking, I'm rolling
I'm being bad, she posing
So ride with me, see the stars
I make a bitch kick rocks like Steve Seagal
I need a Jackie Brown, money bag
Got her walking out the mall with a hundred cash
Shawty dance with me, I want it bad
I put the weed out if you wanna chat
Me, Phee-rell, blue V12
Two females, no e-mails
It's the same game, straight brain game
I ain't lame mayne so he hit a lane change—switch!
I'm rich smoking L.A. weed
Mama on my dick for a flick with L.A. Reid
I send a brick to my L.A. Gs
I need a pass and a bag of that L.A. weed

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch
The whole crew getting down in this bitch
Yellow music worn blue, getting down in this bitch
Yes I want (what you wanna do?)
I want (what you wanna do?)
Get down twice (what you wanna do?)
And then let's roll (what you wanna do?) Switch it up
Yessir

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
She really turns me on
She's so attractive
Hold my intention captive
Ohh, can't wait to smash her
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
Sky high! Sky high!
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
If you want it and you know it, get your hands up
Sky high! Sky high!

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Back to me, you attracted me
Get all the details of a masterpiece
We kissing French, foreign ground
She know what's up, she going down
She transforms into super head
Then I tell her what a student might do for bread
She stop, drop, let it shake
Let it, let it, let it, let it shake

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Tell me who getting down in this bitch
Ma I'm looking at you getting down in this bitch
The whole crew getting down in this bitch
Yellow music worn blue, getting down in this bitch
Yes I want (what you wanna do?)
I want (what you wanna do?)
Get down twice (what you wanna do?)
And then let's roll (what you wanna do?)
Yessir
