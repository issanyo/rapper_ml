[Verse 1]
This time I know what I want
Last time I forgot
Everybody pay attention
This time I call the shots
This time I told myself
I'd rather do it than not
Though it's an awkward position
This time I call the shots

[Chorus]
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the ooh
This time I call the shots

[Verse 2]
It's time I speak up
I'm not doing that enough
Without hesitation
This time I call the shots
Boy preach to someone else
I got to listen for myself
Got to say it feels amazing
This time I call the shots

[Chorus]
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the ooh
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the ooh
This time I call the shots

[Bridge]
I guess hard work woke me from
Dreaming one day, my day would come
No wonder I felt so numb
And I guess I wasn't aware
That after all I was prepared
And everything I needed was there

[Chorus]
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the ooh
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the shots
This time I call the ooh
This time I call the shots
