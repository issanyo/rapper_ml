[Intro: Pharrell]
She want to break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Woah, woah, woah
She want some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Hook: Pharrell]
Mamacita, oh my god I think you're on fire
Do you want me to get you water?
You make me want to be your baby father
Cause the dance you do is getting hotter
I better cuff you before the boys follow
Whatchu' think? I think you wanna'
I think you wanna'
She wanna' break it down, break it down, break it down, break it down
Woah, woah, woah
She Want Some Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton, Reggaeton
Woah, woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
(Skateboy!)

I've been long overdue
For something overdone
You've been undertouched, well I can make you overcome
I know he telling you what he can make you and
I know he telling you where he can take you
By the way ma', hey is that your hair?
If it ain't, it took two days in the hair-shop chair
Im just joking
I make you smile right?

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Look, come here, I mean excuse me baby
You dancing fast ma' this ain't Merengue
But your butt in search of your volantes
It's plump I'm being honest, cause it's just nice
You're looking different saying to yourself
(This no right)
Sure you cute, but you know you won't dismiss this plight
When my chain keep binking like Christmas lights
Get it right

(Yezzir)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Daddy Yankee (Spanish/English)]
Yo what's up ma'
You may not know Spanish , But you know Daddy Yankee
Sin uso de esteroides
Y tiendas aquí en Miami
Boxeador latín hustler!
Somos los dueños de los bizcochos y los suplimos a costo
You know mamacita tu si ere' dinamita
Y me la explota si te pones bien perrita
Ten cuidao ! el perro ta ajitao !
Que aquí estamos [?]
Sacude lo cause your body is on fuego
La vida real en mi corazon la llevo ma'
Keep it going son los matones
Con los pies en la tierra y la mente en millones
Yankee Y Pharrell dándote la rumba buena
Con mas sabor que la comida de abuela

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Pharrell]
(Hey girl!)

Let's go finish at mi casa
Trust me, it'd be proper
I got muchos negros on my lache with the choppers
If they suspect us, someone trespasa
All you hear is BRRRAT and then scream, Cucaracha!
Trust me, P is no pimp
See I got heavy pockets, so I walk with a limp
One night with he, and I'll make ya scream
You'll wake up, (wake up) like it's a dream
Call downstairs, tell em to make us P.J.s
Right after that, dry cycle our P.J.S
Right after that, book us a P.J
What you mean, how? When you got money, it's easy
This ain't dookie, ma, I'm not Green Day
Wake up, you're about to miss your damn dream day
Now everybody just sing what the screen say
It goes

[Hook/Outro]
