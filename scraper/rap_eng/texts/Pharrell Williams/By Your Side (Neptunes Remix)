[Verse 1]
You think i'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think i'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you want
Ha hah hah, hah hah, oh
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me

[Verse 2]
When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in
I will show you you're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone and you can't get back again
I will find you darling and I will bring you home

And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time
You'll be fine

[Verse 3]
You think i'd leave your side, baby
You know me better than that
You think id leave you down when you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you wrong
Ha hah hah, hah hah, oh
And if only you could see into me

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
Oh, when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
Oh, when you're low
I'll be there
By your side, baby
