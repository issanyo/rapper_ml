Hit me with that one more time
Hit me with that one more time
Hit me with that one more time
Nigga, the next time I see you
It’s going down

[Bridge: Buddy]
Man, I’ve been rapping for a while now
I’m talking, me and my niggas freestyling like
Every time we would have a little pow wow
Grab the iPod, plug it in the iSlide
Go ahead, cut the beat on
And I'm spitting hardball off top of the dome
But right before would I go, I be like

[Hook]
Hit me with that one more time, I be like
Hit me with that one more time, I be like
Hit me with that one more time, I be like
The next time I see you
It’s going down

[Verse 1: Buddy]
I think I’m about to get my barking on
Hopping out the middle of the water when I’m tryna get my dolphin on
Walk around the corner just to get a Swisher ‘fore a niggas pops get home
Caution homie, cause a nigga flow sick so
Every single thing I put a coughin' on is in a coffin, often
Plotting on how to make a little more cake with a little more frosting on it
Beats slap cause I got a martain on it
Aiming at my target then I'm launching on it
Then I’m flying off in a spaceship with a big sign on the side that say Compton on it
Uh, so don’t be gawking to me when you’re walking to me, talking to me
You don’t know how shocked I'mma be
You gon' be lost, standing there like, uh, well, um
Yeah, yeah, someone should have told y’all Buddy boy in this here
So I'm telling every single one of y'all, remember this date
Then check up on a nigga next year, yeah
Watch out, watch out, cause I think I’m about to switch gears
Smash on the gas, lemme fix my mirrors
And when a nigga pass, I’mma be like, yeahhh

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Young kid in his own world
She 18, but she started early
I'm Bape jeans, black and grey 3's
I love A5's and piano keys
Matrix bend it back, she just like Keanu Reeves
In the Matrix nigga, running from them agents nigga
I went through a lot of stages, but I never been no hater
Them people wanted me to snitch, but I took 3 like pager
Room keys, I'm AWOL
Worked hard and it paid off
She twerked hard and I laid off
We goin' in all day y'all
Know what I'm talkin' bout?
Talking slick, I'll chalk you out
Baby girl thought it was a game
So I took down there my mama house
Cold game, four chains
Fingers up to trust in fame
Do this here for the culture
I can see it clear, a takeover
Veggies
