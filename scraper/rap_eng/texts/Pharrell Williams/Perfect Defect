[Pharrell]
First day of school, guess who
I would bump into?
The creme de la creme, that's you
But they treat you like, doo doo
So then you had to use, my wit
And think a-bout it
That's when I had to admit
They were right, you're the shit

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Pharrell]
Let's take it slow to begin
Don't worry I got the blueprint
Get to know you, then we win
Friends turn to love, the end
I know it's always, somethin'
But they ain't talkin' 'bout, nothin'
This is my car, jump in
Cinderella, no pumpkin

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[N*E*R*D]
Yeah, why?
Ahh c'mon cheer up baby
You know I make you laugh
Meet Tina, Tonya, Tracy
We're havin' a bubble bath
The girls are blowin' bubbles
They naked in the field
The smoke comes out the flowers
Mm-hmm, you know the deal

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Pharrell]
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for me!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nothin' for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl
