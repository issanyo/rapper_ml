[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
They call it planet Earth. Tears; eye water
They call it planet Earth. Fear; eye water
Such a waste of clear eye water
Such a waste of real eye water

[Verse 1]
No one uses energy savers
Car emissions kill ozone layers
Look at your life now
Little children say their prayers
But the grown-ups don't say theirs
Look at your life now

[Pre-Chorus]
When they first went to the moon
Beyond the moon didn't they see
There wasn't anything they couldn't do
There wasn't anything they couldn't be
They discovered nuclear power
Not for the best but for the worst
Revelations warned you first

[Chorus]
They call it planet Earth. Tears; eye water
They call it planet Earth. Fear; eye water
Such a waste of clear eye water
Such a waste of real eye water

[Verse 2]
First your living was so simple
There was no gas, oil or rentals
Look at your life now
Then technology would teach you
That it's 'robots replace people'
Look at your life now

[Pre-Chorus]
See, when they first went to the moon
Beyond the moon didn't they see
There wasn't anything they couldn't do
There wasn't anything they couldn't be
They discovered nuclear power
It burnt them far below their shirts
They got so hot it almost burst

[Chorus]
They call it planet Earth. Tears; eye water
Such a waste of fear; eye water
Such a waste of clear eye water
Such a waste of real eye water

[Verse 3]
All the Christians, Muslims, Jews
Kill each other, they're so confused
Hmm, look at your life now
From light to dark, big to small
They didn't know God loved them all
Mhm, look at your life now

[Pre-Chorus]
When they first went to the moon
Beyond the moon didn't they see
There wasn't anything they couldn't do
There wasn't anything they couldn't be
They discovered nuclear power
As if to fullfill the dues they curse
For what happens next, my heart hurts, oh

[Chorus]
They call it planet Earth. Tears; eye water
They call it planet Earth. Fear; eye water
Such a waste of clear eye water
Such a waste of real eye water

[Breakdown]
