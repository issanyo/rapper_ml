[Intro]
Oh and hey by the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh and hey by the way

All the stuff that you said
Hey, buddy, naw
Yeah, I heard what you said
All bets are off
You're a choke artist, man
Man you would have stalled
Running against my race, you're lost
You're all at the matinee
The American mall
Where corporations won't pay for effects they cause

[Chorus]
Oh, you won't get away!
Even in your fast car
Oh, you won't get away!
Send your son to the stars
Oh, you won't get away! Hey Hey!
Smoke in the garage
Going to your head
'Cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong

[Post-Chorus]
Deep, deep down body thurst
Wrong
Deep down body thurst
Hey hey, yeah yeah!

[Verse 2]
Oh you wonâ€™t get away, yeah
Oh and hey by the way

Mane, fuck what you say
We're gonna climb your wall
Okay Murphy's Law
It'd be worth the fall
I sure hope you're just talking, man
And that's all
'Cause we'll go over it, under it, around it
We have the gall
Oh, you're not the Milky-way
Or the center star
It doesn't matter what you win
If inside you're lost

[Chorus]
Oh, you won't get away!
The way you treat Islam
Oh, you won't get away!
Jesus will open his arms
Oh, you won't get away! Hey Hey!
Mr. Wizard of Oz
It must be going to your head
'Cause your intentions are dead
Dead wrong!

[Post-Chorus]
Deep, deep down body thurst!
Wrong!
Deep down body thurst!
Hey hey, yeah yeah!

[Outro]
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
Oh, and hey, by the way
As you listen to this, know that we're designed for you
Oh, and hey, by the way
