[Verse 1]
J-E-double-T-double-U-oh
I got a swagger that'll attract a harajuku
They say they got nothing on you
'Cause I'm out of this world on Mars, where's Bruno
Another beat that I stumbled across
That I felt, so you know I had to double the bars
And I melt, I'm for real, the flow's so uncommon
Feeling like I'm spitting in a puddle for y'all
I be rapping in a muzzle and all, I'm dogging
I be all for it like a couple of paws
With a couple of others from a hundred dogs
I be on my bed sheet no cover at all
I be on my tank ish, no hummer involved
I be on my bank ish, all commas and clauses
Flow wet like salt dissolving
Underwater, but I am far from the solvent
I'm on that uhh uhh
They on that uh oh
And they be on my sour belt like Kool-Aid
'Cause I be stunting like growth nigga
I'm on top of every line like quotes
The only time I cycle is a circle from a donut
V8 engine, supercharged flow
With more horsepower than a fresh dyno, nigga
This be that new shit
That Jet 2  on some cool shit
That Jet 2 want some coochie
Wait, oh, ho! Excuse me
Ha, I'm a cool influence, but sometimes I like it stupid
And like Nike, I just do it
And I act like my mind is loosened
But really the truth is everyone is a college student
So I'm on my scholar too shit
Shit, I could've been a doctor too bitch
But I just choose this
'Cause right now I'm tryna be the coolest
But I ain't even cool, I'm a square that got dipped in some coolant
Ha. She say I'm too big, but really I think what the truth is
That no matter what the size is, when it's inside it's like a toothpick
But I Pac-Div you could've swore I knew the Cool Kids
Could've swore I was in movies how I'm scoring with the music
I'm my new sense, ladies say I'm such a nuisance
And the flow is so translucent like I'm Dr. Seuss' student
Nigga I be on my Clipse Grinding
Hit them holes like Tomlinson
Could've swore I been signed
'Cause that mind control's so Common
Run them skins like Donovan
I be so off topic
But always on top of it even when I'm off top
Yeah, I'm on that uhh uhh
They on that hot pana thing thong
Not a damn near, ni- nada of you mutha fkas hotter than my theme song
Nigga I be seeing sounds, N-E-R-D for real
I eat beats for dinner, could've been a smuck like Steve Carrell
Ahh, Where has Jet 2 been?
Losing all his screws left
Funny thing is I got several left
Yo' girl higher than treble clefs
On that note, I'm icy yo synopsis has been devil breath
I might be so uneven, beat the game 'til there's no level left
I'm on it like eleven, I'm the number one's equivalent
To the sum of six and five, XI
My thoughts are just so prevalent
I'm on that bang thicki thang thi thang ki thang thang
Braw ticki braw thi bang thi bang bang
Raw ticki raw thi bang thi bang bang
Ti ti taw ticki taw thi thang thi thang thang
My sound's galactic, I'm so erratic
But so efficient like spikes on cactus
I'mma park out of space where my ships are validated
I begin where every week ends like Saturday, bih
I'm on my zshurp zshurp
They on that errr bow
I'm on my no recognition shit
They on they "oh wow, oww"

[Outro]
Welcome to my world
This is just a collage of all the crazy things
I think about on a daily basis
So I present to you
I present to you
I present to you, No Recognition
