[Verse 1]
Karma came and went
And so did my alarm, so I stayed in and slept
A waste a day just to evade regret
Cuz Ima parade of displayed missteps
My mind works overtime
To remind me to have some patience
But procrastination is inherent to my generation
Some clarification the American nation
Is taping your conversations
Especially the one's you had up in your basement
Where you conspired to get baked with
A bag of lay chip's and some natty boh's
Like its product placement
I'm out of place but still the most complacent
My admiration for imagination
Has been fading since my last sedation
And after graduation I traded aspirations
For instant gratification

[HOOK]
But if you take your love away from me
I'll go crazy, i'll go insane

[Verse 2]
And I only trust a few in my school of friends
Cuz to Mr.zimmerman I'm just hooligan
And our president is black
Guess we got fooled again
Half of em' is arguing about who goin' to win
They don't know when they kids is getting food again
So Fuck a bank, fuck a teller, fuck a penitentiary
Naughty by nature with my treachery
They got kids making symphonies
And we can't think collectively
So Introspectively I intercept trajectories
With telepathy I kill my enemies
And since my infancy and adolescence
I've had a Audible essence in frequency and presence
But the question is never the fluorescence
But why human beings and machines have planned obsolescence
I'm out of lessons
I used to be a non contestant
But with so much time invested
Might as well give em that desired perfection
And I'm wired for blessings
Raised on a stage where the fire is deafening and
The tired are restless
So tired and restless

Late night and quiet on the old frontier
Cloud City
Cuz you can see the whole world from here....


[HOOK]
