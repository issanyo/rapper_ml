Part 1
[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Rocket Williams]
Sing the letter G
Hmm, okayG
Lightning fire magic prayer
Lightning fire magic prayer
N.E.R.D

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Light bulb, fire and cause of all that is
There was, and will be, beyond beginnings and end
The town, they say it's you, that starts the fire
Without matches that will open desire

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Live wire going through your body
Burn the old, make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?

[Chorus 1: Pharrell Williams]
Lightning Fire Magic Prayer
Far beyond the gaseous layer
What if we all put our hands in the air?
For that lightning fire magic prayer

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Sometimes, you may have to do unpopular things
For them to see your faith lately go sane
You may not refer to it by a name
Long as you know from whence you came

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Livewire go through your body
Burn the old, make you anew
It's a mystical experience party
The universal connection to you
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
I begin, I began, I began

Catch me out here

Part 2

Catch me out here (Hey)
G

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
They got the crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is in high tide
Something in the water
You can tell when they dance

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
Wasn't everything that everybody promised
Once you tried it, did you think that you could stop it?
Everything has a cause, did you profit?
You can't see your life, until you sit and watch it

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
They got that crazed look in their eyes
Something in the water
Everybody's in a trance
Because the brainwash is in high tide
Something in the water
You can tell when they dance

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams]
A young fish doesn't know that it's wet (Yeah)
Once it swims and starts drinking, it forgets (Yeah)
Know the fish bowl is your technoloâ€”
G
No direction sailing everybody follow me
Can somebody burst it down?
Waitin' for the great, I am
Can somebody burst it down?
Waitin' for the great, I am

[Chorus 1: Pharrell Williams]
Come on now, lightning fire magic prayer
I can't believe it's never been done
Imagine if we once, all hands in the air?
For that lightning fire magic prayer

Where do I begin?
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
Mad ethnic, mad ethnic
Where do I begin?
I begin?
