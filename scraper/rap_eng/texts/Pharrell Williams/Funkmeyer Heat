Yah baby
Yah baby
It's that Funkmeyer beat



Well it's a long time coming

Yah it's oti and me
Hard to believe

We do not deceive
Can not believe

Believe what you see
1953 born to my mommy

I ain't come around till 1980

That was the year bought my first Porsche see

I know it looks strange when you're lookin outside
But that's the whole point cuz lord knows I tried
To just fit right in
Get a young girl my age
Play on playa
Cuz that shits played
The heart don't know nothin but what it know
And me and jfunk it says that's so

Yes I love my oti
And my oti loves me
And with love in our hearts
What more do we need

Talking..
See.. I'm like.. Could she e any cuter this girl.. I'm like... For real.. Could she.. Y'all know she went to Juilliard right? On some broadway shit... Yah she's my broadway bitch... Still got that hip hop lip

Ok.. WHere was I..
Oh yah.. That's where
Talk in about

How we really don't care

I mean we care

Yah we love!

Love the earth

And sky above

Just dont need opinions

No we don't need none!

Not at all

Off the wall

I got a friend named Paul
Wow I'm gettin off course like a little kid
I like to kid a little and I always did

And I always will
Always be me

Yo my girl jfunk you're like so sexy

Yah baby
Yah baby
It's that Funkmeyers beat
That funkmeyers beat
Bring that funkmeyers heat
Keep it mad discrete
Peeeps get on ya feet
And stay up off the seat
This is your defeat
If you ain't on my team







I just keep going sometimes... Sorry about that...
