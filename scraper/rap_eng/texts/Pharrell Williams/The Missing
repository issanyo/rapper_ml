[Intro]
Come on, let's get away
Go missing, missing a million miles away
Go missing, missing
Come on, let's get away
Go missing, missing a million miles away
Go missing, missing

[Verse 1]
Oh, I wanna be the first to tell you
Your heart's down low, heart's down low, yeah
Oh, but I'mma be the first to bring you
A brand new show, brand new show

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding a sign up and it says, babe
Come on, let's get away
Day tripping, you're mine, you'll be impressed, babe
A million miles away

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not the type that goes to extremes
Makes sense, baby, makes sense
I think that, baby, you and me could rewrite the scene
Makes sense, baby, makes sense
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
And they won't find a trace of us
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
And they won't find a trace of us

[Verse 2]
Oh, I think it's time I finally told you
You raise my flag, raise my flag
Oh, a perfect state of (Ibifornia)
Can't look back, won't look back, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding a sign up and it says, babe
Come on, let's get away
Day tripping, you're mine, you'll be impressed, babe
A million miles away

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm not the type that goes to extremes
Makes sense, baby, makes sense
I think that, baby, you and me could rewrite the scene
Makes sense, baby, makes sense
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
And they won't find a trace of us
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
We could go missing, missing, missing
And they won't find a trace of us

[Bridge]
This is a long life and our love is strong
(You always come back)
We always come back
Won't be missing long
(You won't be missing too long)
This is a long life and our love is strong
We always come back
One day, we'll be back home

[Outro]
Come on, let's get away
Come on, let's get away
A million miles away
Come on, let's get away
