[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody close your eyes, ascend, go up
Everybody close your eyes, ascend, go up
Everybody

(Go up!)

[Verse: Cat Power]
I remember, a little kid
I remember singing a song
Do you remember when you were young?
Don't you remember when you were singing along?

My-My-My-Ma-Maria
My-My-My-My-Guayin
My-My-My-My-Maria
Oh wakachan hasaya
Oh wakachan hasaya

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, ay
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, ay

[Verse 2: Cat Power]
I remember our fun
I remember our own on the run
Do you remember where we belong?
Don't you remember when you were singing along?

My-My-My-Ma-Maria
My-My-My-My-Guayin
My-My-My-My-Maria
Oh wakachan hasaya
Oh wakachan hasaya

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, eh
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, eh

I don't know what you're looking for
But you're more than welcome with us
Traveling at the speed of mind
To enhance our fight within love
Beyond the stratosphere, you just wanna go up, eh
Like a child's balloon filled with helium, eh

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Everybody close your eyes, ascend and go up
Everybody close your eyes, ascend and go up
Go fast, go fast, go fast, go fast, go fast
