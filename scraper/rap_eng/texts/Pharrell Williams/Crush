[Verse 1]
Come here stranger
Come and dance with me
Listen life changer
Don't fret take a chance with me
When you move like that
I can just fall in love with you (In love with you)
You think I'm speeding, that's until you see
I wasn't, I was leading the future for you and me
And when you move like that
I can just fall in love you (In love with you)

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please do that for me
Let them know you're my baby

[Verse 2]
Speechless, enchanted when I see you baby
Reachless, romantic just keep dancing baby
When you move like that
I could just fall in love with you (In love with you)
Ooh keep climbing make your mark in here
Your eyes keep shining though it's dark in here
And when you move like
I could just fall in love with you (In love with you)

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and move
Please don't think don't think just groove
Please do that for me
Let them know your my baby

[Bridge]
It's weird I know but somehow I know
I've been handed you, you've been handed me
It's like some fantasy
I like you I want you
Dance with me
Forever (ever)

[Verse 3]
You're undecided you wanna mingle more
Your face just brightens when you think of me as yours
And when you smile like that
I could just fall in love with you (In love with you)
Seems like the world suspects something baby
They should pinch themselves
Cause they ain't dreaming baby
And when we kiss like that
The whole world would just fall in love too (In love too)

[Chorus]
Close your eyes and move
Please don't think just groove
Please do that for me
Let them know your my baby
