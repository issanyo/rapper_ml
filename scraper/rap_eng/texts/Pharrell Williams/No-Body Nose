[Intro]

All your life you thought you were a player
But at the end of the day you lost to an LG slayer
You asked for this so now you're on the track
You should know what happens when Swizzy spits these facts
Throw you under the light show you what you lack
It'll all be clear like seeing through the crack
We got the whole true squad on the attack
Now it's your time to shine you're about to be sent back

[Verse 1: K Swizzy]

Nobody knows ain't that the truth
Back to the beginning cause I'm too uncouth
Start with G6 cause everyone knows
How you love to hang around them gossip hoes
We got Grace, White, and that new one Zoe
Just don't take her to the park you need to take it real slow
You know the girls won't fall like dominoes
So you bought two sponges, what were you gonna do with those
I know school is tough we all have our lows
But you sure do seem to have a couple of those
But you know it's all good I just gotta expose
You can keep on running but you have no woes
Calling others short but your on your toes
Press, bench, curl maybe one day it'll show
If you had to pick we all know what you chose
I saved the best for last before I had to go
You got no body and you gotta big nose

[Hook/Chorus]

Yeah
You got no body and you got a big nose
You can ask anybody
But you got nobody
It must be sad when she got real dodgy
In other cars kissing in that shotty
Acting like you don't care huh? Buddy

[Intro 2]

Watch out when I say
Cause Swizzy don't play
It's ok to feel this way
Rabbits don't hunt a prey
You can keep skipping leg day
You get psycho every Thursday
But now it's time to pay
You can just ask Mojdah

[Verse 2: K Swizzy]

I know this all sucks life can get a bit rough
We all have weak sounds just like stale coco puffs
You egged her house because felt misled
You cleaned it down there cause you thought you were gonna get head
But I always wanted to know if your nose does grow
Maybe when you lie like Pinocchio
You took an extra class but not for the credit
I went to join, but now I know why you did it
She be falling for ballers, so you tried to be one
You went to one tryout after that you were done
We can see clearly that you've been outrun
She did the baller, the crawler, and then everyone
Now that's everyone except you
You should know by now, just ask the crew
You got glasses on your face, but what are those
It must make up for that body and that large ass nose

[Hook/Chorus]

You got no body and you got a big nose
Yeah

You can ask anybody
But you got nobody
Where the marks at huh? do you even study
There are battle stains but I ain't even bloody
I wonder how you must be feeling now Arty
