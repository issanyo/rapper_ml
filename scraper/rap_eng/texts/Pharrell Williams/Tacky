[Verse 1]
It might seem crazy, wearing stripes and plaid
I Instagram every meal I've had
All my used liquor bottles are on display
We can go to see a show, but I'll make you pay

[Chorus]
(Because I'm Tacky)
Wear my belt with suspenders and sandals with my socks
(Because I'm Tacky)
Got some new glitter Uggs and lovely pink sequined Crocs
(Because I'm Tacky)
Never let you forget some favor I did for you
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you're okay with that, you might just be tacky, too

[Verse 2]
I meet some chick, ask her this and that (Can)
Like, "Are you pregnant, girl, or just really fat?" (What?)(Can)
Well, now I’m dropping names almost constantly (Can)
That's what Kanye West keeps telling me, here's why

[Chorus]
(Because I'm Tacky)
Wear my Ed Hardy shirt with fluorescent orange pants
(Because I'm Tacky)
Got my new resume—it's printed in Comic Sans
(Because I'm Tacky)
Think it’s fun threatening waiters with a bad Yelp review
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you think that's just fine, then you're probably tacky, too
Hey come on ah

[Bridge]
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can never know why (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, I said (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, it's pointless to try (Tacky)
Bring me shame, can't nothing (Tacky)
Bring me shame, I said (Tacky)

[Chorus]
(Because I'm Tacky)
43 Bumper Stickers and a "YOLO" license plate
(Because I'm Tacky)
Bring along my coupon book whenever I'm on a date
(Because I'm Tacky)
Practice my twerking moves in line at the DMV
(Because I'm Tacky)
Took the whole bowl of restaurant mints, hey, it said they're free
(Because I'm Tacky)
I get drunk at the bank and take off my shirt, at least
(Because I'm Tacky)
I would live-tweet a funeral, take selfies with the deceased
(Because I'm Tacky)
If I’m bitten by a zombie, I’m probably not telling you
(Because I'm Tacky)
If you don't think that's bad, guess what, then you're tacky, too
Come on!
