Skylar:
It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time, lady

Skylar with The Warblers:
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

Blaine:
Sing

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Blaine:
Louder

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Blaine:
Sing

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Skylar:
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray

I told her my name and said "It's nice to meet ya"
And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness I'm in deep
If anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissing my mouth

Skylar with The Warblers:
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

Blaine:
Sing

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Blaine:
Louder

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

Blaine:
Sing

The Warblers:
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Can you feel it?

Blaine (The Warblers):
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
(Can you feel it?)
All that I can hear is music from the back
(Can you feel it?)
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand, darling

Blaine with the Warblers:
Before the beat kicks in again

Blaine:
Can you feel it?
Ooh, ooh, oh
Can you feel it?
No, no, no, no, oh

Blaine with the Warblers:
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
From your head to toe
Oh, oh, uh-oh
Oh, oh, uh-oh

Sing
