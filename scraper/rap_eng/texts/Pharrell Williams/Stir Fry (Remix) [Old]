[Verse 1]
Cookin’ up Ramen after school time
Store bought shit with a sprinkle of Thyme
Ricey bipolar, change like tie-dye
One day he tryin’ shoot you, next day he fine
Throwing up on the court, too much Popeye’s
Sean really tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly
Won’t let you roll in peace, jailed up like Tentacion
Who told you drop the bomb?, that’s Kim Jong’s job
Reheated rice, apartment lights
Shared bed, hair lice
Control your bro Chris, he eat too much, Chris
Four wing orders and chips, please stop the man, Chris
Many wings, VR things
Pulling strings, for a lower ping

[Chorus]
Keep watching me drop fire, where’s your promised mixtape?
Stop eating dogs in the nighttime (yeah, woo, woo, woo, roof)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah)

[Verse 2]
Brian gon’ take an intermission, cool it down a notch
Thanks for the master sword, finna whack you in the crotch
I bet you are gonna try to dodge, but that ain’t gonna work
It’s gonna end up gettin’ lodged in you like a spork
Microwave shit, stop, yeah, keep braggin’ but don’t got a track
Bet you regret dissin’ me for multiple reasons
You can cook burritos, but no one present said whoa
Always asking if you can pay me back, loser broke
Continue watching me, study my moves but can’t copy me
Loser Monopoly, remember when you lost six thousand?
No AP, class, weird for your Asian ass
Listen to Keith Ape, bet you’d enjoy vape

[Chorus]
Keep watching me drop fire, where’s your promised mixtape?
Stop eating dogs in the nighttime (yeah, woo, woo, woo, roof)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah)

[Verse 3]
He eat up rice with curry chicken, he still ain’t fly
Release the birds from the Ramen, at least let them fly
Whack you up in my backyard
Make sure you die
Of course before that the mission is giving you a black eye
The horror smelling from your cookin’ create dead guys
Not tryin’ discriminate, but to see success, open your eyes
Play football for the school but can't run for shit
When you play Madden, only way you win is cheat codes
Why you keep tryin’ touch me
And say that I’m thick?
You’re so damn stupid, fat and male London Tipton

[Chorus]
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah)
Keep watching me drop fire, where’s your promised mixtape?
Stop eating dogs in the nighttime (yeah, woo, woo, woo, roof)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah, nah)
Sean tryin’ Sang but that ain't really fly (nah)
