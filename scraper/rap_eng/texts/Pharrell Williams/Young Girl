[Intro]
(You never, you never listen to me)
(I'm just, I just wanna tell you, something)
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl
(That's true, so true)
(You're the only girl I love too, but)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
(So true, so true, listen)

[Verse 1 - Pharrell Williams ]
I wasn't trying to lead her on
See I didn't want to be alone
But when she smiles she brought me home
So I brought her home
Its not that the feeling of love is gone
Can't expect a college girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways

[Pre-Chorus]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus]
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 2]
The single girls are out tonight ("hey, Pharrell!")
But you have my word, my heart, my life
And I'm not looking around
So why you lookin' down? (what you lookin down for?)
I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldn't give a fuck what tabloids say
And crushes hurt both ways

[Pre-Chorus]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do

[Chorus]
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (uh huh)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Hov' got a young girl
Hov' got a young girl
Still not quite 21
So high strung, such a vibrant thing
I introduce myself, "Hi, Miss Thing"
You're 19?
No, you're lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow
The scene that follows
Screams of horror
Classic Stephen King novel
Mama don't think you should take someone
So advanced in romance, you should just wait
Papa don't preach, Hov don't bite
Hov' been threw it, I might mold your life
'Cause I'ma show you right
Proper etiquette, how to hold your knife
Keep it competitive with Oprah's ice
Be like Janet, take control of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do (young girl)
Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do (young girl)

[Chorus]
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(Too young, a little too young)
Young girl, so in love with you
(Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Too young, a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Just a little too young)
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Too young, a little too young)
Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do
(She's a...) (Just a little too young!)
My heart was soakin' and I broke it in a young world
What on earth, what I'm supposed to do
Young girl, so in love with you

[Outro]
This is where it all begins, baby
