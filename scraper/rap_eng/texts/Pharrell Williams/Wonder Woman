Whoaaa, whoaaa
Go!
[Verse 1]
I'm feeling funny, feeling high
They looking at me, I don't mind
Now it is easy to walk on by
I don't want what you got so you better move along

[Chorus 1]
I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out!)
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out)
That'll get you nowhere
You don't wanna see what happens when I get provoked
You don't wanna go there
See me spin around, see me swing my golden rope

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh I got power (Wonder Woman powers)
I see signs
They shouting "Honey, (Wonder Woman powers)
Watch your behind!"
They can't catch me (watch out, watch out)
Cause I'm too strong
They all want what I got
Never leaving me alone

[Chorus 2]
I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out!)
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out)
You don't wanna go there
Trying to confuse me say I need you when I know I don't
That'll get you nowhere
Go on and try me you can't catch me you just blowing smoke

[Breakdown: Pharrell]
Ooh, I think you playing games
Unh, this ain't no Catwoman
Uh, I think you playing games
I don't need a bad girl

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh I got power (Wonder Woman powers)
I see signs
They shouting "Honey, (Wonder Woman powers)
Watch your behind!"
They can't catch me (Wonder Woman powers)
Cause I'm too strong
They all want what I got
Never leaving me alone

[Chorus 1]
I ain't gonna break for that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out!)
I ain't gonna take all that
I'm a Wonder Woman (watch out)
Heeeyya, hey
There's no Wonder Women
I'm the Wonder Woman
