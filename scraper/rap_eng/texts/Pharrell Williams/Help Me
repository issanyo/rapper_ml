[Pharrell]
Help me! Cause I, can feel, the fumes
Cause someone in cool, has made it inside the room
Our ideas get shared, not a good one gets spared
And you're just sittin there, suckin up the air
(Okay, you got it, you wanna do somethin 'bout it?)
(Wait a minute, what's wrong, somethin broke?) C'mon!
Help me! Is that, a snake, I just saw?
Well they can only live where the grass and weeds are tall
Well I'm stuck, and no cost to please my eyes
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die - C'MON!!~!
YEAH! DIE BITCH DIE! Uhhh

Help me! Cause this ain't good for my health
So you can have this room and do them yourself
My oath, won't let, me conspire
While your presence, set our sanctuary, on fire
Help me! Cause YOU'RE intentions aren't pure
Cause COOL can only be killed, never absorbed
And I, will not stop, or com-promise
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die - C'MON!!~!
WOOO! YEAH! YEAH! Uhhh

Help me! Understand why you're surprised
But never mind that, please look outside
Submarines and flying machines and fellas you know
Point signs that say we shoulda nuked you a long time ago
Help me! See those war machines out there?
A pack with your karma, do you care?
Just know karma, doesn't stop when you cryyyyy
And no, I won't kill you but I'll watch you die - C'MON!!~!
WOOO! YEAH! YEAH! Yeahhhh

Help me!
