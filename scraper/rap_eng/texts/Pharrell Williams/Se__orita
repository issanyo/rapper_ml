[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Justin Timberlake]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Yes, yes I am
And he goes by the name... Justin
Wooo
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl
Come in right here?
Yeah, come on

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & (Pharrell Williams)]
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down (So he said to himself)
She deserves a crown
But where is it now?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Running fast in my mind
Girl, don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you (Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (He don't love ya, baby)
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

[Chorus 2]
Ah, ah, arms
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Baby, won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to cry (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things (Deal with things), that you don't have to
(Don't have to, oh)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms (Yeah)
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to cry

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See, they don't do this anymore
I'mma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Guys sing:
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Feels good, don't it? Come on
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Yeah, ladies
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
(Show the good in me)
Sing it one more time:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Gentlemen, goodnight
Ladies, good morning
And that's it
