Rita, my love
I have always loved you since the day we met
Hugging smelling your beautiful hair
You're such a sweetheart, that the other Bloom guy
Dreams to be like
Now I am taken back to my roots
My sweet old guitar
Four Lovely Guitars
Great Guitars of Heart
Baby, I Need Your Guitars
Your Cheatin' Heart
A Song for Rita

I Love You Rita
You were always the one in my head

Now let's talk about my real friends in the business
Nicki, Miley, Cleo, Mia are my girls the rest can't relate
That Cardi should shut her mouth before the catch me outside girl catches her
Now let's talk about guitars

There's A Good Reason Guitars Are Numbered, Rita
That Bloom guy has my heart now by Force
