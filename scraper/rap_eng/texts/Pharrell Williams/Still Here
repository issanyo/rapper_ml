Hmm pharrell
Hey, i'm still here
I'm sure you what i'm talking about
All this time you misbehave me
I should leave
I'm still here
Honey you would want that if he would call
He is so beautiful
Don't you stand there staring at this stickers
Like is a studio
If whisper in your ear trust me do i'll do it all
Until it's time to go-o-o-oh
Don't be upset with me (upset with me)
I think your girl is home
I wanna go out what i do
But i'm trapped in his house
No, he won't let me leave
He says i turn him on
Won't you believe it? i'm still here
Now we're naked and he got the nerve to be
Lonely in ...
I'm still here (that's right)
Now we're steping ... round the room
Like we know we're going we know we wanna going back ...

For some more
Rodeo ride
He's riding on my back
That would only know
When it's time to go
Let me get my keys
I think your girl is home
But she won't let me leave
She'd say i turned him on
I wanna go out what i do
I'm trapped in his house
I just got to go now
Time to go
Let me get my keys
I think your girl is home
I wanna go out what i do
I'm trapped in his house
Don't be upset with me
I think your girl is home
So, if you won't let me leave
And tell your girl to go
I got all that i do
I'm trapped in his house
O-oh ye-yeah
