Lyrics from B96 SummerBash

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 1]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?"
(When he came in the room)
He said there’s a lot of girls I can do with
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him
I didn't listen

[Pre-Chorus]
I know he's the spot (hey)
We're running out of moonlight (hey)
People say that he is hot
So here's your ticket, girl, it's a shot
And I can't make decisions with the stress
Should I say yes? (uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh na-na

[Instrumental bridge: Pharrell]
Uh-huh
Hey

[Outro]
Havana, ooh-na-na
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, yeah
Havana, ooh-na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh-na-na

Lyrics from 24K Magic Tour

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na (ayy)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh huh)
Havana, ooh na-na

[Verse 1]
He didn't walk up with that "how you doin'?" (uh)
(When he came in the room)
He said there’s a lot of girls I can do with (uh)
(But I can't without you)
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
(That summer night in June)
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana

[Verse 2]
I knew I was there when I read the signs
(Welcome to La Yuma)
I knew it was him when he hugged from behind
(It gets me every time)
He's put in work, but it's in the streets
(He said, girl, can you ride?)
And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, I knew it when I met him
I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like
Oooh, and then I had to tell him
I had to go, oh na-na-na-na

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na (let's go!)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ayy, ayy)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na (oh yeah)
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ayy)
My heart is in Havana

[Outro]
Havana, ooh-na-na
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, yeah
I said, Havana, ooh-na-na
Half of my heart is in Havana
My heart is in Havana
Havana, ooh-na-na
