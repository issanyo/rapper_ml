Perpetual Nights

Blooming like a hot breen rose
Going places that nobody knows
Staring at the deep blue skies
Nothing you would ever want to miss
Baby, but this ignorance is bliss
Everlast in paradise, ooh

Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'
Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'

Deeper than I think we'd ever known, known
We'll take the journey just for how it goes
Right into eternal sunshine
So, don't you worry it's far from morning
Forever stuck in paradise!

Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'
Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'

Bride with me
And maybe then you'll take a ride with me
Let's reach beyond the last can be into eternity!

Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'
Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'

Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'
Perpetual heart, perpetual nights
So amazing, we're running moon blazin'
