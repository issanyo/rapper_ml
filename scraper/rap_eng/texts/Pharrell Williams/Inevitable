The weatherman said today there’s a slight chance of rain
I had to laugh to myself, cause on any given day it’s been a hurricane
Knocking down my power lines
Shaking my foundation
Breaking all my window panes
I’ll build again and I’ll send you a letter
Self-addressed so you know
Exactly where to go
Please don’t reply, just arrive
With the future in your eyes I adore
Show me what they’re for

This is inevitable
When will you believe this is inevitable
Time may turn the leaves but it’s
Inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend

Somebody thinks they won a lifetime in your sun
Fancy restaurants cocaine nights
Thinking you’re the one to give him every touch
But I know so much better
It’s a matter of a moment
Til you break into a run
You’re gonna try with all your might to forget
But like a ghost I appear
To whisper in your ear
Then I’ll see you smile
As you dial all the numbers
Memorized, filed away
For this very day

This is inevitable
When will you believe this is inevitable
Time may turn the leaves but it’s
Inevitable that we
Will eventually see
Another spring again
On that you can depend
This is inevitable
As long as we still breathe

This is inevitable
The tide may move the sea
But it’s inevitable that we
Will eventually see these waters rise again
On that you can depend

You can try to deny it baby
You can try your best
