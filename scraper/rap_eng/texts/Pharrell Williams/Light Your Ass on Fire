[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Bust it, baby I know you probably really
Need a table cloth to cover your ass
Digging in your pocket while you rubbing yo ass
Shit so big just put the club in yo ass
Prep the H2 park it right infront of yo ass
I see your little gap between your cunt and yo ass
And make you jump inside the whip and smoke a blunt wit yo ass
I'm saying hmm, the shit'll spread like a rash
The way they ass wiggles see I got the shit on a smash now listen
I light the L smell a wiff of the hash
And bag all the bitches, now watch you see me zip in a flash
I'm saying hmm, now I'm a put you on blast
Just like a tint window when you put your shit on the glass
Bust right through the window then it sit on the dash
And have a nigga driving wreckless till you making him crash
(Hah, c'mon) we making money and shit
Now pop your muffin while we be watching you shaking your shit

Welcome to Hot-and-Hazyville
It make you wanna dance till you break your heels
I know you love the way the God make your feel
Now watch me get deeper than a Navy Seal (Navy Seal?)
It got a crazy feel, shit feel like you in a danger field
Hypnotize, stuck it in her, daze for real
That's exactly why we call this one Hazyville (Hazyville)

[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
Baby, just shake ya ass till you spread on the floor
I noticed that your ass too big for your draws
You need a - a chiropractor just to marry yo ass
To tell the truth you need a tractor just to carry yo ass
Fo reala, you motherfuckers probably think that I'm playing
All bitches love to talk and all that other shit I be saying
And going hmm, see how you putting it down
I love the way you shake it throw it around!
