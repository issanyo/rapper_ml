[Intro: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
(So what?)
Let’s do something different
(Yeah)
Let’s change things up
(OK)
I’m tired of doing the same old thing
(You and me both)
Let’s give people something to think about
(Here we go)

[Verse 1: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
Here comes the sun (Here comes the sun)
I’m tired of coming undone (Oh, coming undone)
There’s been so much darkness
Too much of the time
I think its a sign (Must be a sign)
Here comes the rain (Here comes the rain)
Wash away all the pain (Wash away the pain)
Coming together, going apart
I want you to stay (Hope you wanna stay)

[Pre-Hook: Madonna]
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride
Two steps behind, you’ve got too much pride
Always supporting, never the star (Never the star)
Get it together, ’cause the beat goes on

[Hook: Madonna]
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes

[Verse 2: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
Here comes my hand (Here comes your hand)
Take it while you can (Take it while you can)
I’ll throw you some rope
If it will give you hope
Want you to understand (Understand)
Here comes your smile (Here comes your smile)
Hope it stays for awhile (Stays for awhile)
You know it’s contagious
It might sound outrageous
But I feel so alive (Feel so alive)

[Pre-Hook: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride (Never the bride)
Two steps behind, you’ve got too much pride (So much pride)
Always supporting, never the star (Never the star)
Get it together, ’cause the beat goes on

[Hook: Madonna]
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes

[Bridge: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
I can’t keep waiting for you
I can’t keep waiting (Take it down)
Anticipating that you
Will keep me waiting (Take it up)
I can’t keep waiting for you
I can’t keep waiting (Take it down)
Anticipating with you
‘Cause see the beat goes on

[Pre-Hook: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
Always the bridesmaid, never the bride (Never the bride)
Two steps behind, you’ve got too much pride (So much pride)
Always supporting, never the star (Never the star)
Get it together, ’cause the beat goes on

[Hook: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes (Take it down)
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes (Can’t keep waiting for you)
On and on and on the beat goes
On and on and on the beat goes (Take it down)
On and on and on the beat goes

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Madonna & (Pharrell Williams)]
I can’t keep waiting for you
I can’t keep waiting (Take it down)
Anticipating that you
Will keep me waiting (Take it up)
(Can’t keep waiting for you)
I can’t keep waiting for you
I can’t keep waiting (Take it down)
Anticipating with you
‘Cause see the beat goes on
