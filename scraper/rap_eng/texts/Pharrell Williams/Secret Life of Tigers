[Intro]
Squad

[Verse 1: Shay Haley & Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, you're saying welcome to the jungle, yeah (Come on)
Got all this freedom in your room
Your mom's against the immigration
Your dad's against your right to choose

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Screaming with saliva
Secret life of tigers
Bite your neck off bitch
You fucking with survivors
I understand it strangely
Welcome to what changed me
Credit card pay attention
Watch the mob get angry

[Chorus]
Are you mad right now? (hey)
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now? (hey, hey)
Pipe down, pipe down

Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
You know what day it is, right?
That alien life
They say it ain't right

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
I'm kinda afraid of here and after
Do you mind if it's me and you?
'Cause this room got more space than NASA
You serious, is that really your truth

This the madness
This the madness
This the madness
That they (Yea)

This the madness
This the madness
This the madness
That they (Yea)

This the madness
This the madness
This the madness
That they (Yea)

This the madness
This the madness
This the madness
That they (Yea)

[Chorus]
Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now? (where ya at? What ya doing?)
Pipe down, pipe down
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night

[Verse 3: Shay Haley]
You climbing up that skyladder
Ya, You feel like AC when it's June (Hey, hey, hey)
Your parents discriminate with the bathrooms (The fuck?)
Do they know these girls are in your room?

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Screaming with saliva
Secret life of tigers
Bite your neck off bitch
You fucking with survivors
I understand it strangely
Welcome to what changed me
Credit card pay attention
Watch the mob get angry

[Chorus]
Are you mad right now?
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now? (hey, hey)
Pipe down, pipe down

Squad

This the madness

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
I'm kinda afraid of here and after
Do you mind if it's me and you?
'Cause this room got more space than NASA
You serious, is that really your truth

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Sensation, I've got it backwards
Society got you feelin' ass hurt (Hey, hey)
Get in, get out and get away (Skrt)
So, kids come home looking knackered (Hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Are you mad right now? (C'mon)
Bite down, bite down
Are you tired right now? (What you doin' where you at?)
Pipe down, pipe down

Say, say, say
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Serotonin overload
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
Say you up all night
Woo
You up all night
