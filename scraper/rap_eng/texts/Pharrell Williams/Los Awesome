[Hook]
I'm a groovy type nigga, rather two-step with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, rather gangbang with you
Triggers squeeze, throw a palette, throw them thing-things with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, do my gangbang with you

[Verse 1]
Groovy nigga, jumped off of the peg
4th by my 3rd leg, plead the 5th
No Ls, no whips, backyard full of Crips
Barbecues and county blues, this Hoover gangster be the shit
It ain't much up on our list, shoot the killer and hit the licks
Get EBT up out the bitch, gangbanging, fuck a clique
Yup, I'm looking for a scrap
See, my Cripping done spread around the world
Put his top below his bottom, it's the reaper

[Pre-Hook]
Looking like the reaper in your driveway
Strays through your living room
Liable to drive-by on a summer day
July 4th will be in June
Bla-tay bla-tay bla-tay bla bum
The sound of the drum that Crips and Bloods know
Bla-tay bla-tay bla-tay bla bum
The sound that the drums sing

[Hook]
I'm a groovy type nigga, rather two-step with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, rather gangbang with you
Triggers squeeze, throw a palette, throw them thing-things with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, do my gangbang with you

[Verse 2]
Don't make me put a lean to a nigga spleen
Shells through a nigga, pariiing, Peedi Crack, riiing
Stop a dream in its tracks beam down
Little boy now, dream little boy, dream
Coke go in the pot, arm and hammer body
A$AP Rocky, want it I could get it
Onion in my pocket like the booty on a midget
Diamond on my rollie, teach a nigga how to fridge it
Looking at the times, they been winning for a minute
See my neck, co-defendant, what's the problem?
Seen the souls long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper

[Pre-Hook]
Looking like the reaper in your driveway
Strays through your living room
Liable to drive-by on a summer day
July 4th will be in June
Bla-tay bla-tay bla-tay bla bum
The sound of the drum that Crips and Bloods know
Bla-tay bla-tay bla-tay bla bum
The sound that the drums sing

I'm a groovy type nigga, rather two-step with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, rather gangbang with you
Triggers squeeze, throw a palette, throw them thing-things with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, do my gangbang with you

[Bridge]
Tell me more about it in the gutter
Where it started with the Cripping
Blue on campus know it happened
Tell me more about it in the gutter
Where it started with the Cripping
Then the Bloods done got it brackin'

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
(Suwoo!) I'm just a Eastside nigga
William Nickerson, show you what it be like, nigga
Roll 'em up, light 'em up like a street light, nigga
Follow me, I can show you what these streets like, nigga
Handle bars of a Schwinn, guns blow like dusty winds
Spend a band, push his wig back when that revolver spins
Toe tag 'em, false flagging like it's all good
Tell niggas tee off like Tiger Woods, where you from?
We never heard of ya, walking with the murderers
Niggas that'll murder ya, steal you like a burglar
Seemed the soul was long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper
