In the middle of the night
Touching under the light
Wearing somethin tight
Thats what hot girls do
Seems like she don't try
For her its just usual
She Poppin it
Dropping it
Ain't stopping it
Have you watching it
She Poppin it
Dropping it
Ain't stopping it
Have you watching it
She says she feels it in her heartbeat
Makes me feel only you
But to her it feels new
She says she feels it in her heartbeat
She ain't you, She ain't me
When she dance she feels free
Which makes her feel like the only one (the only one)
But the light shines on (hey)
I told her bout a light
Say she ain't living life
I know its who am i, how we call you
Say hey don't you like
Dancin and feeling beautiful
She said she Poppin it
Dropping it
Ain't stopping it
Have you watching it
When im Poppin it
Dropping it
Ain't stopping it
Have you watching it
She says she feels it in her heartbeat
Makes me feel only you
But to her it feels new
She says she feels it in her heartbeat
She ain't you, She ain't me
When she dance, she feels free
Which makes her feel like the only one (the only one)
But the light shines on (hey)
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
Said my booty get down like (ooh) ooh
