Hey

[Verse 1]
Excuse me if you find this sound dumb
Looks like somebody else got my wife
So tell me where the f... you came from
(Where you came from?)
I never seen nothin' like you in my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I closed my eyes and try
Not to think of your eyes
Not to think of your smile
And the face you're making now
Should've thought about that before
You came strollin' through the back door
The back door of my heart
Tearin' everything apart

[Chorus]
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)

Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Hey

[Verse 2]
Okay, I gotta tell my mom about you
I hope this is okay in God's light
Yeah, He dropped you off here but He's not through
(He is not through)
Grab my hand, help me map out my life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I closed my eyes and try
Not to think of your eyes
Not to think of your smile
And the face you're making now
Should've thought about that before
You came strollin' through the back door
The back door of my heart
Tearin' everything apart

[Chorus]
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)

Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Hey

[Post-Chorus]
If you need, you can leave
And things would be the way they were, baby
But from what I see, you need
Someone to cool that fever from me

[Bridge]
Obsession (My heart, heart go boom, boom tap)
Our rocket ship is ready to go

(I think I'm fallin' for you)
I said oh, oh, oh no, no, I
I think I'm fallin' for you
(I think I'm fallin' for you)

Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
Oh no, no, obsession
