[Chorus]
Don't you know that we're able?
That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yes, we can
Yours and mine, alchemy
Yes, we can
Are one and one equals three
Yes, we can
I feel it like lightning in the forest
Yes, we can
And they can know to pick a note to harmonize a chorus

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my woman, don't need another
Get behind the other, we can lift each other
Tornado weather, we another level

[Chorus]
Don't you know that we're able?
That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yes, we can
Like a solar system thoughts surrounded by you
Yes, we can
Won't no another star up there say it ain't true
Yes, we can
We shine so bright they can't ignore us
Yes, we can
Who could be against us when you know who is for us?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're my woman, don't need another
Get behind the other, we can lift each other
Tornado weather, we another level

[Chorus]
Don't you know that we're able?
That alone makes us major
We can all sit at the table
And grow in his favor
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah

[Bridge]
Baby, yes, we can
The love that we have like the clouds in the sky
(Baby, yes, we can)
We ain't in no rush, we can take our time blowin' by

Thats why

[Outro]
You're my woman, don't need another
Get behind the other, we can lift each other
Tornado weather, we another level
You're my woman, don't need another
Get behind the other, we can lift each other
Tornado weather, we another level
