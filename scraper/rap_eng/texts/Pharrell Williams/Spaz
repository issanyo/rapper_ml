[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hey, I'm a little teapot short and stout
There's some shake up in around me, know it's talking about
I pop the lid, the lid, it's gon' be me, I'm gonna let it out
Nothing'll hap' if I don't open my mouth
I ain't a punk bitch, I don't give a fuck
I'm just being me and speaking from the gut
Well it's a little bit of us, a whole lot of you
And we just came here to see what it do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Verse 2: Shay Haley]
I'm a little teapot, blowing off steam
You put me on the heat, I don't whistle, I scream
Bang (bow!), bang (bow!), fuck a bed fuck a dream
This is rage blowing up your machine
I'm a star, bitch, I don't give a fuck
Don't be surprised when this bitch start blowing up
Well it's a little bit of us, a whole lot of you
And we just came here to see what it do

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
And now I'm waking up, laying in the ambulance bed
With something in my arm (I gotta get it off)
And tied to it, a line that'll read your mind
And next is your mind (I gotta get it off)
The shit they spray attack my lungs everyday
With a creeping decay (I gotta get it off)
By attacking these things, I earned my wings
And my halo but first I gotta get it off

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can turn tables and you can throw chairs
I'm right here, and I ain't going nowhere
You can knock doors and tear gas the air so
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
Spaz if you want to, spaz if you want
Spa-spaz if you want to, spaz if you want to
