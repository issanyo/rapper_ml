[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Funny thing about the apple
The peach is sweet, but ain't the same
The pear compares, but that's natural
This ain't no cobbler or meringue

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Willians]
It's funny when the arrow's aiming at you
Inscribed with your name
You pray that it just goes past you
Cupid's only gonna shoot if he knows it's his game

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame) (Lucy Liu!)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happens quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Hey baby, I'm bananas about you
Oh girl, I lose control
Life would be nuts without you
I got this heart shaped bowl
Cover my soul

Can I have a bite?

[Break: Pharrell Williams]
You know that Harlem isn't here right now
Okay, one two three, stop

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (chorus)]
You turn my ovens on (Flame)
You can smell when it's warm (Flame)
Burn the house to the lawn (Flame)
Happen quick as they on (Flame)

[Pre-Chorus: Alicia Keys]
It was Adam and Eve
And the God in the trees
And the snake, oh yeah
Cause everybody is destined
To learn all these lessons alone
Don't be afraid

[Chorus: Alicia Keys (chorus)]
This gon' wake you up (woo-woo)
Smell when it hit the flame (woo-woo)
Hurry 'for it burn up (woo-woo)
Cause it won't be the same (woo-woo)
