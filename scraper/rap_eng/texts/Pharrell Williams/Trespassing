[Pre-Chorus]
Well I was walking for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying "who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come

[Chorus]
"No Trespassing" that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

[Verse 1]
One day I was tripping and that's when I could see
That the ether that I tapped into could be reality
It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
Once I hit that mountain peak I began to lose my mind

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine

[Chorus 2]
Make their faces crack
There's no turning back
Let's GO!

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I was walking for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying "who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come

[Chorus]
"No Trespassing" that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

Hey, ooh oh

[Verse 2]
I ain't got BS in my bag
That's the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is glass
Come on baby, can't you see?

[Verse 3]
I don't need no GPS
To show me where to go
But I can turn into the north pole
And show you what is cold

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine

[Chorus 2]
Make their faces crack
There's no turning back
Let's GO!

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I was walking for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying "who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come

[Chorus]
"No Trespassing" that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!

[Bridge]
Wait till ya get a load of me!
I said wait till ya get a load of me!

[Break]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 4]
I ain't staying at home
I got places to roll
I ain't staying at home
No no no

Hey hey hey
Hey yeah yeah yeah!

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine

Heh heh
Heh heh
Heh heh
Heh heh

Let's GO!

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I was walking for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying "who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come

[Chorus]
"No Trespassing" that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
No Trespassers? Yeah, my ass!
Wait till ya get a load of me!
