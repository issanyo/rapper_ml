[Intro: Pharrell]
Ayyo, that special order LV backpack?
I wasn't wearing it just to show off
I got plutonium in there
(Mr. Williams, we'll be taking your orders now)

[Hook: Pharrell & N.O.R.E.]
I'ma live the dream yo
No time to sleep yo
If you know what we know
Y'all niggas finito
(Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem)
Looking through the peephole, I can see the people
Looking for the heat yo, ya'll niggas finito
(Oh, it's an animal anthem
Oh, it's an animal anthem)
What's poppin', poppin'
(Yeah, the spot is) poppin', poppin'
(Yeah, my knot is) poppin', poppin'
(My Glock is) poppin', poppin'
So provocative

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Ayo the bricks that they front me out of the country
Do that thing monthly, mujeres they still want me
Them dudes finito, I sell chico to a chico magnifico
The truck and my seat low, magnetic
Your thug cosmetic
Swag synthetic, you get your shit shredded
Eyes low as scoliosis, prognosis
Ferocious, get a dosage, yo hold up
Put your hands in the air, yeah this a hold up
Hong Kong and Beijing kush kung fu karate
Kawasaki ocky, your shit sloppy probably
Gold guns to say the least
That's just for de Louise
Wherever there's Indians, I'ma come and play the chief
A-oo-ga they basura
The Neptunes ain't gotta be thugs, cause I'm their shooter
My new guns is plastic, new N.O.R.E.'s a classic

[Hook]

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Animalistic, futuristic gold biscuit
Artistic, hands roll kush terrific
Alien, out of this world, I must have want more
Pyramids, Egypt style, look like the Luxor
Dashiki wrapped on my face though
I say so, go anywhere the weight go, for peso
Rosé ?, connect named Felipe
Nacho Libre, hood like Wee Bey
Colombian necktie, respect and let the tech fly
Send ya'll jefé superslime Aztec-a(?)
Drink agua, lay up in Caguas
Still on my rah rah, no Lady Gaga
Still I rock the diamond holder
Mami give me brain, I think that she a mind controller
I don't mind her over
Stop one corner store crime, I'm on top of it
Them dudes is wash, I'm exact opposite

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I split Swishers with my thumb slime
They say numbers don't lie except one time
Young Tune, got goons on the front line
These hoes tryna get on like they unsigned
Side-step counter, right, left, punchline
Real niggas don't do sit ups when it's crunch time
Get high, sing songs on the guitar
Got your girl on my dick like a see-saw
My son tell his friends "daddy got a racecar"
T roll blunts longer than the space bar
Dreadhead, high socks with some Vans on
Bullet hole bigger than the Grand Canyon
Neptunes on the beat, NORE what it is
Chop body parts off, stick em in the fridge
Yeah, kiss my ass under the mistletoe
Young Money motherfucker, if you didn't know

[Hook]
