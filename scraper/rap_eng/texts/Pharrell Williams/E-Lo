[Verse 1]
And there's nowhere I'd rather be (Rather be)
When they take with the one hand and take with the other
On the day all the hands go free (Hands go free)
And the sun's gonna shine
The sun's gonna shine on me

[Chorus]
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo

[Verse 2]
Mama Maria, she would take my hand (Take my hand)
Down to el Rio Sol (Ooh)
Saying, "Oye for real hijo understand" (Understand)
"Hands can hurt or heal so"

[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go

[Verse 3]
Mama Maria, she would take my hand
Down to the Rio and flow
Baxabana ogxam baxabana ngenoxoxo
Bexakwe yinuxba xaka

[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
All the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go

[Bridge]
And there's nowhere I'd rather be (Rather be)
Gonna raise up the one hand and raise up the other
Hurt me outside, inside I'm free (Inside I'm free)
And there's no enemy
Everyone is my brother
When the truth comes to set me free (Set me free, yeah)
And we're not going to fall in and out with each other
On the day all the hands go free (Hands go free)
Then the sun's gonna shine
And the sun's gonna shine on me

[Chorus]
Tell all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
And all the people go
O-lo-e-o-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Free hands go

[Outro]
And the sun's gonna shine on me
And I know, one day I know
The sun's gonna shine on me
Let my hands go free
Let my hands go free
Let my hands go free
The sun's gonna shine on me
Let my hands go free
And all hands go free
When all hands go free
The sun's gonna shine on me
