[Verse 1]
They couldn't believe I did it
But I was so committed
My life was so restricted for you (For you)
I just dove inside it blind
Couldn't see what swam inside
Thought that'd be romantic for you

[Verse 2]
Exchanged my vows and said it all
On the ledge, prepared to fall
Even screaming, damn it, for you (Remember?)
My friends said you would play me
But I just said they're crazy
While I was crying frantic
Was it true?

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)

[Verse 3]
I sent you to Vegas with a pocket full of paper
And with no ultimatums on you
I thought "What could separate us?"
But it just seemed that Vegas
Only brought the player outta you
(Hey baby, what's your name?) (You think?)

[Verse 4]
Lavish homes and fancy cars
Even got the drop Ferrari filled up our garage for you
Made your choice with all the teens
People and US Magazines
Tell me, who'd I do that for? Who?

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do (Stupid freaking things)
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)

[Bridge]
And don't you worry about our angels
All the magazines trying to intervene
Saying things in the gossip section
They'll get good guidance and be trained well
Don't worry, I'll keep our little secret
But I ask this question

[Chorus]
Why should I be sad?
Heaven knows
From the stupid freaking things that you do
Why should I get mad? Feel sad? Who knows?
Just take it all as a sign that we're through (Goodbye)

[Post-Chorus]
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
It's time for me to move along (Goodbye)
It's time for me to get it on (Okay)
I'm tired of singing sad songs (Alright)
It's time for me (Britney, let's go)
C'mon
