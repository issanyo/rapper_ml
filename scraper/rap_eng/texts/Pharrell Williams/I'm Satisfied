I'm satisfied, just loving you
I'm satisfied knowing our love is true

Just like the light removes the darkness
You remove all of my loneliness
You put love where there was sorrow
You brought a new dawn in my tomorrow
You gave me everything i needed love
And I truly thank the Lord above

I'm satisfied, just loving you
I'm satisfied knowing your love is true

I need a post that I can lean on, got a love now I can depend on
You picked me up when I was down
I was so lost but now I'm found
Thanks to you my life has been changed
I only want your love to remain

I'm satisfied baby, just loving you
I'm satisfied knowing your love is true

My life is so full of happiness
You controlled my emotions with your tenderness
I am so happy that I got you dear, no more heartaches
And shedding tears, you made a better world for me
Your love has shaped my destiny

I'm satisfied, just loving you
I'm satisfied knowing our love is true

Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Can you get satisfaction?
Can you get satisfaction?
Satisfied, I'm satisfied, satisfied
