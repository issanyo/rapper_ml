Revolution!

Yeah

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
All I know is I can't get the recipe
For how to make my pie taste just like the dream
Oh it's so revealing, a feeling I don' have no feeling
But I bet they tell you don't worry 'bout it just add the cream

[Hook]
AND THEN YOU FEEL GOOD! (3X)
LET IT GO AND YOU SHOULD FEEL GOOD!
Here we go...!

[Verse 2 - Pharrell]
How does every man endure the heckling?
Every phone, internet, and TV selling pie {*ka-ching*}
Tell me the type of pie it is, that's your vision buying it (hey!)
Don't bother with hello, just say bye

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Shay Haley]
Here we go, here we go
Uhh, uhh
Hello, how are you-ah?
Just stopped a second on my cruiser
Nice to meet ya, wanna recruit ya
To the muffin girls of the future
Let me school ya, and renew ya
(Free your mind!) Hallelujah
First I move ya, then go through ya
When I do yaaa...

[Hook] - "here we go"

[Outro]
ALL MY MUFFINS!
Oo ah, oo-oo ah (8X)
Revolution
Liberation
Hm-mmm-hmmmm (3X*)
