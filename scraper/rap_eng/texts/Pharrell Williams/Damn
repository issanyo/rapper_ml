[Verse 1]
What up with Skateboard P, is he that dope?
Or is he really Barry Bonds, is he that Sosa?
I'm on a PJ sofa readin' Deepak Chopra
Tryna figure out how I'mma act on Oprah
My mama like "What you goin' find hustlers for?"
If I'm honest, God moved me I'm just doin' a score
Yeah nigga, to motivate you and your whore
For more chips bigger cribs and a few of them Porsches
[?] hustler music, inmates fight music
I make beige music, I make white music
Hype needles inducin' how you wanna try?
Push a vehicle of choice how you wanna kiss the sky?
And they protect themselves gas and potatoes 'til ya face shows
Get your T-Zones, and clean out your pores
I'm not really sure how the .40 makes a hole
But it removes the dead skin and exfoliates your soul

[Chorus]
Say hell yeah
Say hell yeah
Say Germany
Say Germany
I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell
