Quit talkin' numbers, calculator
Quit talkin' numbers, at you haters
That's a three, talkin' numbers, n-n-numbers
That's a three, talkin' numbers, n-n-numbers
(One more time)
Quit talkin' numbers, calculator
Quit talkin' numbers, at you haters
That's a three, talkin' numbers, n-n-numbers
That's a three, quit talkin' numbers, n-n-numbers, numbers, numbers

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, see me on the front cover of the magazine
Winning, Sheen
Slept on me when I had a dream
I was singing "What you mean, what you mean?"
Now you woulda thought that it was Halloween
How I'm killin' all these niggas in the scene
Got the X, got the purple, got the green
Cause everyday manaman a get lean
Yeah, I'mma lay down some laws
Hold up, pause
Tell my lawyer "fam, look at that clause"
Why's the contract looking like fraud?
A&R looking like a shark
Front teeth lookin' like Jaws
Telling me about all these numbers
Then how come they are never on tour?
Just...

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, just picked up a new pack of the loud
Smell that, wow
Me and P fuckin' up another sound (yeah)
This one shouldn't be allowed (Yeah, yeah)
Never thought you would see me with the crown
Never thought you'd be seeing me around
Knew we were on the same flight
You never thought you would see me in the lounge
This year man are tryna get cheques
Before that I'm tryna get the respect
Stepped out in my new creps
One sec, flex
I just wanna talk to the youts
Nah, I don't wanna talk to the press
All these numbers are making me depressed
Give dem man a fake email address
Man, just...

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
My accountant countin' my cabbage, also countin' my carrots
Vegetarian habits since BBC was established
Richard Mille's a classic, sapphires, not plastic
Like magnifying glasses, when the light hit it, nigga's ashes
The LaFerrari's a carriage, equipped with more, not baggage
One thousand thirty-five horsepower stallions
The yellow diamonds kept clashin' so we made the rainbow teeth happen
Chanel Pharrell, it's funny as hell to my niggas in heaven just laughin'
So just...
