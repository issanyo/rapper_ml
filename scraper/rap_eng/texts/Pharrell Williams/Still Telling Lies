[Intro]
Boo, you know I love you
I'm always gonna be there for you
I'm never gonna cheat on you
I go to school, I go to work
You come home, I cook, I clean
I rub your feet, give you a nice back massage
Always honey, you're a king in my eyes
I don't give a shit what people gotta say about us
It's just me and you and you know it's always gonna be like that
Boo, I love you, always and forever..

[Hook]
Yea, yea, yo
Everybody knows that you're really a ho
So why you still tellin lies to me
All my homies always told me you were phoney
Callin me your one and only
But you really tellin lies to me
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby
Tellin everone you love me
But you really tellin lies to me
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy
Frontin just to get my money
When I know you tellin lies to me

[Verse 1]
Mami, you fly but you lie too much
You not the type to trust
You got'cha eyes on the prize tryin to ride the bus
You like the plush life, but money can't buy true love
You just a slut, right, cause every night you up in the clubs
Shakin' you butt, gettin drunk, coming home fucked up
If you dont want me then I might just find somebody who does
You too much, I can't put up with it, you drivin me nuts
You like to live it up when I'm the one supplyin the bucks
I thought I knew who you was, but you changed
The way you used to do things for me
Now all you do is hang out with your friends
Only call me to bore me wit all your fake phoney stories
Talkin 'bout you up in Jackies house having a cup of coffee, C'MON?!
You know me better than that
Always stay ahead of the pack
Mad at the fact I didn't catch it from scratch
Now that the cats out of the bag
I'm lookin back at the past
Silly bag, you neva loved me, you was after my cash..BIATCH!

[Hook]
Everybody knows that you're really a ho
So why you still tellin lies to me
All my homies always told me you were phoney
Callin me your one and only
But you really tellin lies to me
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby
Tellin everone you love me
But you really tellin lies to me
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy
Frontin just to get my money
When I know you tellin lies to me

[Verse 2]
Hey lady, remember me?
That little kid who took your virginity
Givin you all you need and swore to love you 'till infinity
Remember me?
The one whos been there for you, willing to care for you
Even when you dont share the truth
Remember me?
I took you from a girl to a woman, gave you the world
Plus made your toes curl when I put it in you
Remember me?
And in the begining we was friends indeed like it was meant to be
But now its like I'm sleeping with the enemy
Ofendin me pretending to be something you're not
So I had to turn back the clock just in case you forgot
Dont mean to blow up your spot but you owe me a lot
You were so innocent, now you're the biggest ho on the block
Always lookin hot, talkin like you calling the shots
I'm at my job while you freakin off suckin on cocks
Now that I know the whole plot, should I forgive you or not?
Just kick rocks bitch and be happy that you didn't get shot, WORD UP

[Hook]
Everybody knows that you're really a ho
So why you still tellin lies to me
All my homies always told me you were phoney
Callin me your one and only
But you really tellin lies to me
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby
Tellin everone you love me
But you really tellin lies to me
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy
Frontin just to get my money
When I know you tellin lies to me

[Tony Sunshine]
Why'd you lie to me
Why'd you lie to me
Why'd you lie to me
Why'd you lie to me
Ooh, girl, you's a ho
So you know I really gotta let you go
Should've never really put my trust in you
Ooh, girl, you's a ho
So you know I really gotta let you go
Should've never really put my trust in you..

[Cuban Link]
I should've known better..
