Love this piano
1, Here we go guys, hey

Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here (here) and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

Do you mind if I steal a kiss?
A little sou, little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (steal it from you)
Oh, to memorize the way you shock me (ou, ou)
The way you move it here
Just wanna feel it from you (feel it from you)

Don't be afraid to catch feels (feel, feels, ha ha)
Oh, ride drop top and chase thrills
I know, I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
Oh baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

I'm your window shopper, shopper
Sucker for your love, oh
And I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

Wow, that felt great
That one felt awesome
Can you hear the back, yeaa can we hear that back
