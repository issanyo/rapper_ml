[Hook x2: Nelly & Pharrell]
Drop down and get your eagle on girl
Flap your wings
Drop down and get your eagle on girl
Flap your wings
Hell naw, ain't leaving me alone girl
Flap your wings
Drop down and get your eagle on girl
Flap your wings

[Bridge: Pharrell & Vanessa Marquez & (Nelly)]
(She's got that!) Sweat dripping all over her body
Do you like that sweat dripping all over my body?
(Oh! Oh! Yeah I like that) Sweat dripping all over yo body
You like that sweat dripping all over my body

[Verse 1: Nelly]
It's summertime and I'm back again
Then went to VA yo and got my friends
Say wassup, Pharrell! (These motherfuckers, now)
Yeah! But let's show em what's above an L, BLING!
100 thou' couldn't get ya one of these
I guarantee there ain't a flaw in one of these
200 thou' couldn't get you in the league
And 300 thou' you couldn't even buy the keys
I think ya need to add 50 more G's
Now shall I proceed?! (yes indeed!)
Ho! I need to see ya take it down to the floor
Spread your wings if you're real ma, fly real low
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right Rodeo we'll go
Ho! I talk a lil Fred Siegel girl
Bonnie and Judy Lee but when she bad call Vida Guerra
Apple bottom wit a pearl underneath it
You talking like you don't need it, I can tell ya conceded
I like that in you, I don't see nothing wrong
Drop down and get your eagle on, whoa!

Now what's next, the trend sin up in this party
O.P.P. time, now let's get naughty
You take baby girl and I'mma take shorty
With the sweat dripping all over her body
We gon' move if you wanna (oh!) groove if you wanna (oh!)
Fly ya north up ma and get rude if you wanna
Ain't got nothing to lose nor to prove
Baby girl soaking like she just got up out the pool, eh!
I know you're thirsty ma, go 'head and order what you want
Some call it tricking, go 'head call it what you want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
Cause the black card'll pickup what the grey card won't
Her attractiveness, got me attacking this
Oh so fabulous! Booty is maximus!
She wanna fly south for the winter
I might just go down south just to win her
Hell naw she ain't gon leave me alone
Making plans for us to be at home
Take your pants off ma, you can leave your panties on
But first drop down and get your eagle on, whoa!

From the girls wit skinny waists to girls heavy set
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
To the girls wit extensions to the girls wit dreads
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
From the girls got it good living in the suburbs
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
To the ones in the ghetto wit their hands on their curves
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings, OH!
