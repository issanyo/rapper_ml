[Verse 1:]
This world is ours, mine and yours
(Be my baby, be my lady)
Don't let me feet touch the ground
(That girl's so naughty, we're in a playground)

Sexy games are for playa's like you and me
Just this once I'll let you get into me
I will be whoever you want me to
Cuz I can't wait for love

(DJ, let's start it up)

I will be the cat
And you can be the dog (yeah)
Or I will be the cat
And you can be the mouse (ooh yeah)

Let's put it to the test
And see what we can do
In the playground

(DJ, let's start it up)

[Chorus:]
Run, baby run
(I'm runnin')
I can see you runnin'
Hide, baby hide
(I'm hidin')
I can see you hidin'

Tag, you're it
Catch me if you can
We're in a playground
And we're the playa's

[Verse 2:]
This world is ours for tonight
(Be my baby, be my lady)
Don't get me high, take me low
(That girl's so naughty, we're in a playground)

It's a race
But I'm headin' for the door
Are you sure I'm the one
That you're looking for
(Hello)
I will be whoever you want me to
'Cuz I can't wait for love

(DJ, let's start it up)

I will be the girl
And you can be the boy
(Yeah)
Or I will be the girl
And you can be my toy
(Ooh yeah)

Let's lay it all down
And see what we can do
In the playground

(DJ, let's start it up)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Oooh, we can do whatever we want
Nothing to be stoppin' us now
Come on baby, show me you can
Be the one I love
The one I need

On the playground
(Give it to me)
On the playground
(Girl, we can be anything we wanna)
It's alright now
(Show me that you're mine)

On the playground
(Yeah)
On the playground
(Hey, let's dance now)
On the playground
(Gimme some romance now)
And don't forget to leave your number
'Cuz I'm gonna call you

[Repeat Chorus:]
