[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You got energy, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much time, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much space, but you ain't gonna use it
You got a great big mind, but you ain't gonna use it
We got this energy, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much light, but you ain't gonna use it
You got such good taste, but you ain't tryna use it
Other side to your brain, but you ain't tryna use it
You got an extra eye, but you ain't tryna use it
Remember what you find 'cause you’re finna lose it

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Walking around with the energy of the hot summers
Spread to go weird, and illuminated degrees
The evil incarnates, they wanna take it from us
But, I walk with a force they can't penetrate my beliefs
Hey, workers of mass destruction
Influence your patterns
The energy of a thousand suns
The energy in everyone

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
The energy baby (whoo), the energy baby
The energy baby, the energy baby (Hey)

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
You got energy, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much time, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much space, but you ain't gonna use it
You got a great big mind, but you ain't gonna use it
We got this energy, but you ain't gonna use it
You got so much light, but you ain't gonna use it
You got such good taste, but you ain't tryna use it
Other side to your brain, but you ain't tryna use it
You got an extra eye, but you ain't tryna use it
Remember what you find 'cause you’re finna lose it

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
(Hey)
Don't be surprised if the guilty is among us
Don't kill them, cut 'em, then you let them be
'Cause the enemy is humongous culture poachers
And they score their points by censoring the free
Hey, workers of mass distraction
Try to make you branded cattle
The energy of a thousand suns
(Don't let them get you down, 'cause you got the)
The energy (Mmhm)
In everyone (That's good)

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
The energy baby (In you), The energy baby (In me)
The energy baby (You can't see), The energy baby (Just believe)

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)
Energy (believe), energy (believe), energy (believe)

[Verse 3: Pharrell Williams]
You know that you got it right when people ask, "Hey, what are you on?"
Well, this is the vivid state that revolutions are born
Did you ever realize that universe just means one song
Your soul knew it all along, you were dancing when you were born
Yeah

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
Contemplating time and space
Light is raging then erase
How I stand in the same place?
Connect the million by the waist (Skrt, skrt)
ESPN with the mace
It come to me when I gaze
And when I listenin' to waste
My mind receive it then it plays

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Forward, forward, forward, forward
But it takes you just to lay back, lay back, lay back
Lean forward, forward, forward
I think it's really cool to lay back, lay back, lay back
Come on and lean forward, forward, forward
They keep telling you to lay back, lay back, lay back
But you gotta lean forward, forward, forward, forward
They say come on man lay back, lay back, lay back

[Verse 4: Shay Haley & Pharrell Williams]
It's what possessed the slave to look in the river (Shoo, shoo)
Then he saw his true master, fuck is a mister?
(He was always master, hey)
And sober is the only worthy system (Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
And he's the co-creator with the giver

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
Detach yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
Re-pack yourself
Be back yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
And dream as yourself
Be seen as yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
Beam as yourself
Scream as yourself (let go, let go, let go, let go, let go)
And be king of yourself

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
Contemplating time and space
Light is raging then erase
How I stand in the same place?
Connect the million by the waist (Skrt, skrt)
ESPN with the mace
It come to me when I gaze
And when I listenin' to waste
My mind receive it then it plays

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
Hittin' forward, forward, forward (Believe, forward, forward)
Lean forward, forward, forward (Believe, forward, forward)
Come on now lean forward, forward, forward
(Believe, forward, forward)
But you gotta lean forward, forward, forward
(Believe, forward, forward)

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah
Believe...
Believe...
Believe...
Believe...
