[Hook]
Thinkin' 'bout the throne
While I'm in the sittin' chair
And I don't know when I'll get there
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, just know I'm headin' for that
Big red bone is 'bout to bring the crown
I'm at the top floor and I can't come down
Now that's tight, yeah that's tight

[Verse 1]
Now let me tell you what I think is dope
How I get paid checks just to say what I want
Also got plenty of different chicks that I kick it with
And we be kissin' and holdin' hands
Smashin' and crash through clothes
Never flew first, but I have flew coach
Never got caught, but I have been close
And I never been rich, but I have been broke

And it's sad when you pull into the club with your shawty
Knowin' I just took her, so glossy
All I gotta do to get her to go naughty
Is walk into the booth and then they can go potty
Damn and I run this thang like a stampede
So much smoke, that a nigga can't breathe
All ya girlfriends still tryin' to date me
I'm red lobster, you're shrimp scampi, and I

Gotta tell ya somethin', hope it don't discourage y'all
It's my first act, and your crowd is clappin' for curtain call
Step through my mind, and I promise that you gon' be surprised
We're more alike than you realize, and I'm

[Hook]
Thinkin' 'bout the throne
While I'm in the sittin' chair
And I don't know when I'll get there
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, just know I'm headin' for that
Big red bone is 'bout to bring the crown
I'm at the top floor and I can't come down
Now that's tight, yeah that's tight

[Verse 2]
And as soon as I came in
That's when new women start actin' all
Turnt up off that alcohol
We about to have a ball
Hoes on their toes cause they know I'm G'd up
And Pharrell's seen close, so I'm BBC'd up
Turn on ya TV's and you probably see us
And a lot of people think do you double these silks

Shucks, maybe I should let it go or
Quit racin' and turn applications into the Home Depot (naw)
That'll never happen, no it can't be
Workin' at a farm, sorry it ain't me
Besides I'm out here doin' my thing
And I proceed like, "Nigga, what's a Plan B?"

And them other niggas so sloppy
Plus they really mean to new niggas, so cocky
Look at magazines, and them niggas go copy
I'm only a teen, and I know that they won't stop me

All because I'm in the zone
Sittin' in church while I'm thinkin' 'bout thrones
Convertin' them thoughts 'til they turn into songs
I am dog, throw me a bone

[Hook]
Thinkin' 'bout the throne
While I'm in the sittin' chair
And I don't know when I'll get there
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, just know I'm headin' for that
Big red bone is 'bout to bring the crown
I'm at the top floor and I can't come down
Now that's tight, yeah that's tight

[Outro]
