[Chorus: Pharrell]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea

[Verse 1]
You medicine girl, a medicine girl
You're so heavily in a Hell of a world
You make my mind shine like a head of a pearl
And strut through my thoughts like straight of the curls
And why why why do I feel like cryin'
Every time you leave I swim right down
I wanna call, text but I ain't no time
I know I never want it but I feel like cryin'

[Chorus]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea

[Verse 2]
Wear the cowboy hat and that's so [?]
Like FlogGnaw,  andthat's so dope
And I think they won't stop and that won't go
It's like bass droppin' and it won't blow
Out your window and out your car
A couple lay ways and some stringed Guitars
Gotta love picture's in an Ice cream Bar
Can this verse be shortened please? Aha

[Chorus]
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea
Sandy Squirrel
Life's the ocean, and you're my world
Or the oyster and you're my pearl
You're the only one that's for me
I'm sorry Mr. Krabs
Yes I know the daughter you have
But come on man you can't be mad
I gotta squirrel livin' in the sea
Aha
