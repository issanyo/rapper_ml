(Slim Thug)
Say P, man the other day, boy I'm at the club, mane with this broad or whatever. I walk in, I see her
Talkin' to some dude or whatever you know what I'm sayin'. So I holler at her, I say 'Aye man, check this out
Man, I seen you over there hollerin' at ol' boy. I ain't hatin' on that, you know what I'm sayin'. But I got a
Friend comin' through, too. So when you see her, don't trip, you know what I'm sayin', keep it playa mane
You know what I'm sayin'

(beat starts)

So my broad shows up or whatever, mane. This girl wanna take a swang at her, mane

(Pharrell)
That ain't right
My man favorite record right here
Yes sir P's chick

(Veres 1: Pharrell)
Before you say it's cheaper to keep her
We consider and read her
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater
So put your Porche up, uh
Get your divorce up, uh
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up
Mane, them niggas only wanna mothafucker here
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryin' to inconvient
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners
So keep it player dawg
Don't make me say it, naw
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all

(Chorus)
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going

(Verse 2: Slim Thug)
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya
Rule the one to call and come get out the chain with ya
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patron
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'm a drive
The Double R 760, or the 645, I'm
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain
Money ain't never been a thang
You see watch and the rang
The watch and the rang
Rocks the nicest, never seen nothin' like this
I'm a Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just
Get the shatter shine
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater, mane
You gotta keep it playa, mane

(Chorus)
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going

(Verse 3: Pharrell)
They say J. Lo shouldn't show her ass and all
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm
Now my agent sayin' the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was Lebron
Not the ice, my beat is worth more
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us
I mean, the Smurfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibrate, you can go and ask MiMi
I think and relay it
I blink and PJ it
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it
And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me
Got one in Virginia, 'nother one in Miami
Yes sir

(Chorus)
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksucker if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going
