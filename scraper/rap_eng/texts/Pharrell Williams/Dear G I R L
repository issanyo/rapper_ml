Dear Girl, I love everything about you
Your mind, your heart, your body, everything
it's nothing about you that I don't like
That which makes you different is what makes you special
I love when you're silly, I love when you smile , make a funny face I just melt
It's beautiful to see a girl that's honest and free
You live your life with no apologies
You know who you are you don't care what anyone thinks about your life that kind of confidence is the sexiest thing in the world to me, the sexiest
You know sometimes you catch me staring at you
yeah I know I know, I just can't help it sometimes
I'm trying to figure you out
you like a book I'm like desperately trying to read
I don't care what's in it, I just want to know what it says
your mind fascinates me, I wanna learn from you
I want you to teach me everything you know
The best life lessons came from listening to you
I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for everything you taught me
I named my album after you because - you inspire me
You always on my mind when I create music, always
I want you to love the music I create for you
I hope it makes you feel good
I hope it makes you dance, I hope it makes you happy
It's like, I'm with you even though I'm not there in person
Is that weird? I don't know, maybe
and you already know I mean, and you know I mean no harm
I'm not like these other guys, I'm a lil different
and I'm desperately trying to get you to think about me as much as I think about you , I just want you to notice me
I have no problem admitting that not even Marilyn Monroe
Who Cleopatra? Not even Joan of Ark, that don't mean nothing to me
I just want a different girl, and that's you

Love Pharrell
