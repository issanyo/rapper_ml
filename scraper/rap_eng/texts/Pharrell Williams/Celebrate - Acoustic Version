I want the whole world to celebrate
I wanna come home
To the only place I know
Where the trees I planted grow
I wanna come home
Once I get up I feel better
Then I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
Will we know better
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I'll be just fine
When I see you at the finish line
Doesn't matter if I take my time
I'm coming home
Once I get up I feel better
And I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
Will we know better
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I'm not mad at you at all
But I want the whole world to celebrate
Yeah, mmmm
Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up
Stand up, stand up
And have fun
'Cause we just begun
I want the whole world to celebrate
Let's go
Once again if I feel better
Then I pull myself together
I remember those two letters
It will be OK
Everyone says now or never
I say only if it's better
Be a night like this forever
I wanna go home
(I want the whole world to celebrate)
I wanna go home
(I want the whole world to celebrate)
I wanna go home
(I want the whole world to celebrate)
And celebrate
I'll get the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
I want the whole world to celebrate
