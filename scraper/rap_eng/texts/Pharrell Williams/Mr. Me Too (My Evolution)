This is my
Is my evolution
My evolution
My evolution
This is the story of my evolution
I'm the byproduct of my own solution

Play this at a party and everybody gets hot
Pete B go gettin' while y'all can get got
Start this off again I love when it drops
Do ya boy a favor and play it from the top

[Hook]

Been two years since I was heavily boozin'
Detoxed myself, locked me in a room and
I though it was me but its you, who's stuck losin'
And I got one question, Fuck y'all been doin?
Bottle in a bag and a chaser in my left hand
Blank look on the face, and grams on the night stand
Looked at my reflection, couldn't notice myself
Ripped the fuck out of my own book
Wrote a section, self help
And who went and helped Pete?
Not a single fuckin' one of ya
Fought deamons in my sleep
Talk to God so I could overcome
Troubles and my difficulties
Never ending twosome
Take a step into my thoughts
Ever seen something so gruesome

[Hook]

Wanna study Pete? Then go get your cliff notes
Was bout to take a shot, I am talkin' pistol
Instead I copped a flow, slick as Crisco
Haters ask first, Pete B where you get yours?
Hand is on her ass other hand still on that chaser
Showed up late to class, didn't even have my paper
Looked at my reflection, couldn't notice myself
Ripped the Fuck out of my own book
Wrote a section, self help
Am all that I'm meant to be
Bullshit will come and then it will go
Rewriting my history
Talk to God, I had to let him know
Believe in him as he does in me
Gettin' dough for every show
And blow it all on white tees

[Hook]

Fingers on my pulse
Right hand tightly grips my phone
Afraid I might convulse
To be like me is not condoned
What the fuck happened on my way of gettin' grown?
I hit my deepest thoughts with all that tree that I be blowin'
This is not a ploy this is not a cry for help
Fuck all of that noise, ya boy can help himself
Just some proof that you don't need nobody else
As long as you got yours, then push on through the hell

This is my
Is my evolution
My evolution
My evolution

I once was a menace and no body could stop me
Now I'm just fresh and every body gon' copy
I was once like the rest
Oh yes, I was a clone
But then I got a goal, I just had to get my own
I coulda drank all ya under a coffe table
But now I rap like novels, and even spit fables
Story bout a young man
Clear thoughts he couldn't able
But soon he'll be on tv
Talking dish and even cable

This is my
Is my evolution
My evolution
My evolution
