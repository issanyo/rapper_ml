[Intro]
Sometimes
Sometimes the world gets hard
Oh, na, na, na
I'm gonna take it from there, girl
Don't you worry

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your lake or your bay
And any problems that you have, I wanna wash 'em away
I wanna be your sky
So blue and high
And every time you think of me, I wanna blow your mind

[Verse 2]
I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there
I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

[Verse 3]
I wanna hold your hands
Review all your plans
I wanna make sure every one of your dreams will stand
I wanna be your broadway show on review (Why?)
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shining path to help you across
I wanna be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here (Take it from here, baby)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl (No, no)
I'ma take it from here

[Verse 4]
And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here  (That's what I'm gonna do)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time (Don't you worry baby girl, baby girl)
Don't worry, girl (Baby girl)
I'm gonna take it from here (I'll take you wherever you want)

[Bridge]
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here

[Bridge]
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding (Fly away)
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

[Chorus]
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here (I got somethin' I wanna tell ya, baby)

[Break]
Love ain't always the way they write in books (No, no)
See there's the good guys and also heartbreak crooks
Your heart's the real book; just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide

[Outro]
So there you go
Don't worry
I'll be the one
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here
