[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
My heart is filled, with love and care
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there
The answer's simple
You lift me up
The view up here, I see all the stars
There go Venus, and there go Mars
Somethin' you been through
You're from above, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let go
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it
But I didn't know
You s'posed to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
With your love, I can board the skies
Riding away that electrified mothership other
Can I stow away? (Can I stow away girl, girl?)
Colourful winds of the northern sky
Is the closest thing, and here is why
Cause we're color
You blow me away (blow me away girl, girl)

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I need it like I breathe it
Music and colors can make one hover
Who cares if they don't see you?
Don't you know that they're the same?
I need it like I breathe it
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer
Who cares if they don't see you?
You gotta tap in and learn the way

[Chorus: Daft Punk]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Pharell Wiliams]
When I first saw you, I got excited
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it
But I didn't know
I didn't let it go
Then I realized I'm trying to fight it
Just so they can learn to ride it
But I didn't know, oh
I had to let it go

[Chorus: Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams]
Like a gust of wind
You head me off sometimes
Like a gust of wind
You push me back every once in a while
Like a gust of wind
You remind me there's someone up there
Who ushers in
The air I need to power my sail

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
When I open the window
I wanna hug you
Cause you remind me of the air
I said yeah
Cause when I'm feelin' real low
I remember I love you
I put my hands in the air
And you were there
