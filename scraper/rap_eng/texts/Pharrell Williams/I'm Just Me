[Intro]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many things
I've seen so many faces
Been called so many names
Kept getting into fights
Just for staying in the lane
Life's full of adversities
You will if you stay the same

[Verse 1]
Never though a million years I would blow up
Be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
And I rather be flying high
And id be gone
You can call me Hollywood
And tip my heart and see my home
And you see

[Chorus]
A little G to the H
E to the T
T to the O
Now tell me what you see
I'm just Ghetto
I'm just me

[Verse 2]
Now when I'm going home
Your screaming do your thing
Doing commercials now
I'm on the movie screen
And all my fans are going out to buy my magazine
Cover, to cover, I'm being discovered
Never though a million years I would blow up
Be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna
They said that I would try so hard to change my way
You could call me Hollywood
Cause in my heart I'm not the same

[Pre-Hook]
I'm just G to the H
E to the T
T to the O
I'm just ghetto
I'm just me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It doesn't matter what you do
Do you really always shine like blue
Who you are, it's what's going to get you far in life
Riding high, it's alright, hold on
Because its time for you to live your life

[Verse 3]
"You know what I believe
I believe life's what you make it
You determine your destiny
It's one thing I've lived by
And it's so real"
Never though a million years I would blow up
Be the one that carries the hood on the shoulder
And I'm the CEO call me the owner
And I can do anything that I wanna

[Pre-Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
