[Verse 1]
Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'

[Chorus]
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it

[Verse 2]
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya

[Chorus]
Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it
