[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Man don't you know that I'm loco

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, on the East with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
It's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the ese say, he said...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggas proceed to speed
So fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples
Is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)
They see it happens state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the ese's say - they go...

[Chorus: B-Real & (Snoop Dogg)]
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break: Snoop Dogg]
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(Blaow!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!
(Blaow!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Outro: Snoop Dogg & (Pharrell)]
Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
Skateboard P, they say him bust gunshots

Snoop Dogg, him bust gunshots
Skateboard P, you know him bust gunshots (come again, now!)
