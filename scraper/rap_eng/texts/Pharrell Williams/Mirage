[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
It's a funny thing you really gotta see
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy
Or my eyes playing with me

[Verse 1]
(Heat, heat)
All day your love just come shining down
(Heat, heat)
Just like the sweat just beats (sweat just beating)
(Heat, heat)
I feel you from my root to my crown
(Heat, heat)
Just like [?] ([?])

[Chorus 2]
From my caramel that's right beside me
My mind is carousel that's how he rides me
So there's no parallel [?]
Y'all know me very well
It's yellow lighting

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Verse  2]
(Heat, heat)
All night he's traveling through my body
(Heat, heat)
He do it on his knees (on his knees)
(Heat, heat)
Without his love, I'd be cold and starving
(Heat, heat)
He's my H-O-M-E

[Chorus 2]
From my caramel that's right beside me
My mind is carousel that's how he rides me
So there's no parallel [?]
Y'all know me very well
It's yellow lighting

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Bridge]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were [gone?]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were [gone?]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were [gone?]
Just like a mirage
I love you like you were going, going, going
And I'm

[Post-Bridge]
Sorry baby
For the what-ifs and maybes
I take it too far
I know I must be looking crazy

I'm sorry baby
For the what-ifs and maybes
I take it too far
You know I must be looking crazy

[Chorus 1]
Trying to understand the way I've been behaving
(I been behaving)
It's a funny thing you really gotta see (gotta see)
Is it just your love that's got me going crazy (crazy)
Or my eyes playing with me (playing with me)

[Outro]
I spend many nights on my knees praying (my knees praying)
From the side effects of all this heat (this gorgeous heat)
But I'm telling y'all [?] ([?])
Or are my eyes playing with me
