If your friends are asking where you been today
Saying love is in the air does that seem okay
Since the greatest love's inside, let them feel the wave
Double Eleven Day

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
We have so many things to work on that you could address
You know that nothing changes until we unite and press
Show the world your human power, you know what that says
Double Eleven Day

You are not alone
You may think you're just home
Something you all should know
You can do wonders
(It's shíyī, shíyī)

If you could believe
And organize like the bees
You can do it, you'll see there's strenght in numbers
(It's shíyī, shíyī)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 4: Pharrell Williams]
The possibilietes are swimming around inside my head
All the money raised imagine what coulde be done with it
And let the children watch the show, don't make them go to bed
Double Eleven Day

[Verse 5: Pharrell Williams]
So many miracles can happen because of this day
You know the world's watching whishing they could partecipate
There's gonna be 1.3 billion people staying up late
Double Eleven Day
