[Intro]
Now I'm startin' to feel like
Life's not really workin' out
For me, for me

[Verse 1]
So I drifted, drifted, through the fields
And the sun, the sun's just come down
Hear this howlin', howlin' all around me
And I know this is not where I want to be

[Chorus]
Cause I got four pockets and they're full of rocks
And I'm goin' up and down to you
Cause I got four pockets and they're full of rocks
And I'm movin' towards the sea

[Post-Chorus]
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know

[Verse 2]
So I'm sinking, sinking to the bottom of the sea
I'll be sleeping, sleeping while you walk away
Cause I'll be sleeping, sleeping, just dreaming
Cause I'll be dreaming, dreaming, just sleeping

[Interlude]
Sleeping, sleeping
Morning, sleeping in my grave
In my grave

[Chorus]
Cause I got four pockets and they're full of rocks
And I'm goin' up and down to you
Cause I got four pockets and they're full of rocks
And I'm movin' towards the sea

[Post-Chorus]
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know
Let me know where you know

[Outro]
That I'm gone
That I'm gone
That I'm gone
