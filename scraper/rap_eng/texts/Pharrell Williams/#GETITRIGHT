[Verse 1]
I feel a surge coming over me
I feel it all around my thighs
And chills going up my legs
This is the worst coming out of me
When I came, felt like I could die
And it sends chills up my spine

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it -rest it, 'cause you're a criminal

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed all night long
Don't you think it's time to get it on?
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I feel the thirst pouring out of me
The things that I wanna try
That echoes in my head
This is the first time I get to see
Things I've never seen in my life, yeah
You make flowers grow under my bed, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy, sexy
I got things I wanna do to you
Make me, make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it -rest it, 'cause you're a criminal

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed (this bed) all night long (All night long)
Don't you think it's time? (It's time to get it on, yeah)
But we gotta get it right (Get it right)
We can't get it wrong (Can't get it wrong)
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Spoken Interlude]
Do you feel me?
Oh! I thought so
I just uh... sometime you just wanna... be naughty!

[Bridge]
Feel so alone when you are gone
Feeling right back home when I'm in your arms
You played my strings, like my guitar
When I look in your eyes, I see all the stars

[Verse 3]
Would you believe
I'm dancing in the mirror? (Dancing in the mirror)
I feel like I got no panties on
I wish that I could feel ya (Wish that I could feel ya)
So hurry, hang up that damn phone

[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed (this bed) all night long (All night long)
Don't you think it's time? (It's time to get it on)
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you wanna fuel this fire before it's gone? Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Going on and on and make it last forever
What you want all day?
Just as long as it's you and I together
Babe, don't make me wait, yeah
Ooh, oh
Don't make me wait
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Baby
