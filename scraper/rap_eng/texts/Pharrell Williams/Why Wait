[Verse 1]
Put your trust in me
I won't let you down
Don't delay the things
That you want right now

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
Hey, don't you want some action?
I'm not a waiter
I like to make things happen
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Verse 2]
Drowning in your sweat
Till I drench my clothes
You've seen nothing yet
Wait till you let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
Obey my intuition
We're gonna be just fine
I've got a premonition
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Bridge]
I'm gonna dance through the veil of your eyes
While you follow my steps in the sand
I see your fate in the palm of your hand
No one looks, no one hears us this time
It's only me and your conscious tonight
If there are no witnesses, there is no crime

[Pre-Chorus]
Why wait for later?
I'm not a waiter
Something's coming on, coming on strong
Don't take too long
Don't you wanna know?
Baby, come home

[Chorus]
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to...
One more night with you
I won't think it through
Time's money, but you knew
There's nothing in the world
You can think of that I won't do to you

[Outro]
You, you
You, you
You, you
You, you
You, you
