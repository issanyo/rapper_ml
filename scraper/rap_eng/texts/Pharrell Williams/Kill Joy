[Verse 1]
Little Red Riding Hood went riding on her bike
She got just a little distracted cause she seen something she liked
Just because it ain't grandma's house don't mean that it's all good
Cause no one cares if she's in there, and the wolf's still in the woods
(Beautiful losers!)
To you they might look beautiful, but they're rotten in the inside
(Beautiful losers!)
When there's so much dirt up under the cupboard
There's a big ol' lump that can't hide, c'mon
Here they go again, wearing disguises as your best friend
Watch the bullets ricochet, off of the armor like
Blam-ba-blam, blam-ba-blam, hey hey
You know they won't secede, you know relentless they will be
You should tell 'em clear the way
And tell 'em to step back, back-ba-back, hey hey

[Chorus]
Kill joy, kill joy, a kill joy, a kill joy
Watch them bullets ricochet like
Blam-ba-blam, blam blam, ba-blam-blam, a kill joy
Everybody let's go!

[Verse 2]
Think back when you've met them, you'll see it in their glances
That's the seed, that led to trees, which eventually led to branches
Cold as a snowball, downhill to avalanches
Believe you me when the world is coldest when the devil does his dances
(Beautiful losers!)
Don't you wonder why you always end up in last? Uh
(Beautiful losers!)
Well I would bet you anything that it's karma from your past, c'mon
Wake up little boy, there's no spaceship here employed
They zapped that shit away, like
Damn-da-damn, damn-da-damn, hey hey
You're impoverished at your knees
But you gotta stand up and face the fees
And that's when you say, give the shoulder a
Dap-ta-dap, dap-ta-dap, hey hey

[Chorus]
Kill joy, kill joy, a kill joy, a kill joy
Watch them bullets ricochet like
Blam-ba-blam, blam blam, ba-blam-blam, a kill joy
Everybody, let's go!

[Outro]
Everybody, let's go!
