[Hook: Pharell]
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spending money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around, ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm
And I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed
'Cause I got it going on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
No steroids can make you hit what I'm pitching
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratching, my niggas is itchin'
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"
Yes, nigga, P stands for polish
None of y'all is fucking with he, and this is obvious
I'm Ron Artest, laying down to your garbage
While my niggas in the street pushing shit like Ben Wallace
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands
These guns is a sun, you'll catch a tan with ya man
I'm no cheeto, trust this is real/rio
Everything is grande nothing is poquito
Security's behind me, with the torpedo
Cause the wrist stay frigid
How you say it? Frio
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill
And the Enzo's a quarter-million for each whe-el

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I got haters on my jizzock, plus the freaking cizzops
All of whom want to hit me with shizzots til I drizzop
Thank God for hip hop, or I'd be in the bizzox, uh
Jail or casket, either way you rizzot
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a Ziploc
Mr. S Dizzot, it's not gon' stizzop
Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past
Too cool for cizzops to cuff his iz-ass
Snitch as they may, they can't get the boy
These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store
Runnin' to the DA tryin' to get me for
All the money it made, I'm like forget the law
I'm not 'frizzaid, it's Jizzay, homie, you got plizzayed
Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the stizz-age (go sit down)
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S Dot
Tell ya lawyer "Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
(Worldwide)
International, nah I'm universal
'But you a gangsta, how you get to do commercials?'
With them big wigs, 'Yeah, cuh, you do it big'
I stay real, stay sharp, and tell it like it is
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk
They want beef? 'Yeah, cuh,' pop the trunk
We go all the way, we do it life-size
Now my life right, 'cause my wife on my right side
Yeah, and she protecting my interest
Now I'm on the move, they got me hoppin' these fences
Ay little homie, your defense is defenseless
A pimp apprentice, hey, come here princess
(Come here, come here)
I know ya tired of the chit-chatter
It really don't matter, it's like a seesaw platter
I check money, check niggas, check bitches
Now drop it like your ass on switches (Ziip)
