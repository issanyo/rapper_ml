[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

[Verse 1]
When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

[Verse 2]
You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on)
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I wasn't staying
I was leavin' with my flannel on

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

[Bridge]
Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone
And I pledge these arms and chest are here
To hold you in from the cold

[Chorus]
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it (the way you wear it)
It takes your shape while you keep it on (all you gotta do is keep it on)
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

[Outro: Jessica Biel]
Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
