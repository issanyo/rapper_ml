[Hook]
Got the ice, got the clothes
You make suggestions, I presuppose
You piss me off, gold toes
One breath to choke all these hoes
These hoes
These hoes
One breath to choke all these hoes
Just saying you know how it goes
Ike Turner on all these hoes

[Verse 1]
Buy or purchase
Can't afford this
Watch dispersal
Skip commercial
(Scream)
Designer pen
Ink is purple
Bloody myrtle
Jumping hurtles
(Ooh!)
Liberation
Niggas hating
Changing lanes
Bruce or kaitlin
Politics like Sarah Palin
Original, yall some fakers
(Damn!)
Going off, automatics
Headphones, too much static
Blue prints, never planned it
One breath, anaphylactic
Hunting ghosts like Danny
Pop another Xanny
Tyga fucks trannies
Sleep on me like Manny
Blowing up, pakistani
Bad boy, no miami
Win a grammy
This finale

[Hook]
Got the ice, got the clothes
You make suggestions, I presuppose
You piss me off, gold toes
One breath to choke all these hoes
These hoes
These hoes
One breath to choke all these hoes
Just saying you know how it goes
Ike Turner on all these hoes

[Verse 2]
Garden's full of dead hoes
Many seeds 'round my pole
My world is fire, summer's cold
Not a convict, ain't got no pros
(Damn!)
Perseus, fight Medusa
Stone cold, run right through ya
You ain't got the balls, I am Cooler
Pearl Necklace I'm her jeweler
Pool full of bodies
Breaking point like Bodhi
I don't fuck with thotties
Imma grab the shotty
(pump it)
Cock, blast, reload
You don't buy, you download
Respawn like Source Code
I ride solo
Human torpedo
Privilieges revoked
5 hit combo
I cannot be controlled
Hunting ghosts like Danny
Pop another Xanny
Tyga fucks trannies
Sleep on me like Manny
Blowing up, pakistani
Bad boy, no miami
Win a grammy
This finale

Got the ice, got the clothes

One breath to choke all these hoes
These hoes
These hoes
One breath to choke all these hoes
