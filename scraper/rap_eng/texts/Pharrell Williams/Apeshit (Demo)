[Chorus: Quavo]
Stack my money fast and go (fast, fast, go)
Fast like a Lambo (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Jumpin' off the stage, though (jumpin', jumpin', hey, hey)
Crowd goin' savor (crowd goin', hey, hey)
This is what we made for (this is what we made, made)
This is why we're thankful (this is why we thank, thank)
This a different angle (this a different angle)
They know this a banger (bang, bang, bang)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I don't talk to strangers, no, no, no (no)
'Bout my chips with the dip like Doritos (chips)
I got a bad bitch, bad bitch (bad), I got a carriage, carriage
She got expensive fabrics, I told her gas it, mash it (uh)
She wanna go with me (go with me)
I told her roll the weed (roll the weed)
She cannot be with me (be with me)
But I can put you on the team (team)

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
Pass the 'Roc, gimme the ball, take the top shift (ball)
Call my dogs and put 'em all on a spaceship (brr)
Hang with me one night and I'll make you famous (hey)
Have you ever seen the stage go apeshit? (ey)

[Chorus: Quavo & Offset]
Stack my money fast and go (fast, fast, go)

G5 planes (tshh, tshh), Alexander Wang (woo, woo)
She a thot that you claim (woo!)
Givin' me top in my 'Range (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Pop it off, pop it off, don't let me pop it off
Go to the dealer then cop it all (cop it all)
I'm taking a down on the Adderall (Adderall)
I'm serving the purp with the Tylenol (serve)
All of my niggas, I free 'em all (grr)
Hop in the Wraith, wanna see the stars (uh)
Sendin' the missiles off, your diamonds got cloudy fog
250 for the Richard Mille (sticks), yeah, I live in a field (bricks)
The molly make bitches go kneel
The Tec is on me so they be my shield
Look at this jewelry, it's lethal (drip)
These diamonds on me an' they see-through (woo)
