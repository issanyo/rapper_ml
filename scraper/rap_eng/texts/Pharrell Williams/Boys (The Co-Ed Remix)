[Intro: Britney Spears]
For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time
It's over now

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
I spotted you dancing, you made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes (ooh), and the sexy hair
I should shake my thang, make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back, I wanna see what you can do

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited
But you and me were meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (You know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams & (Britney Spears)]
Pull the girl off the dance floor, whisper her in ear
Must've said something about me (What you say?)
'Cause now she's looking over here
You looking at me, with that sexy attitude
But the way your girls moving it, it puts me in the mood

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams & (Britney Spears)]
What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not tryna sound conceited, but meeting you was destiny
I'm from N.E.R.D. (Ooh)
Aren't you Britney? (Don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty thing
(Get nasty!)

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams & Britney Spears]
Girls, I can't even know one (I get nasty)
Girls, well, I need her all the time (I get nasty)
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl (I get nasty)
Girls, but I know she's judging mine (You like that?)

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (Get Nasty)
Boys, to love her and to hold (Get Nasty)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

[Bridge: Britney Spears]
You like that?
Here we go
Have no fear
Baby, what you waiting for?
Uh-uh
Let me see what you can do

[Chorus 1: Britney Spears]
Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold (The way that you move)
Boys, and when a girl is with one (Is kinda turning me on)
Boys, then she's in control (oh)

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams & Britney Spears]
Girls, I can't even know one
Girls,I need her all the time (It's just me and you, baby)
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls, but I know she's judging mine (Get nasty)

[Outro: Britney Spears & Pharrell Williams]
Boys
Girls
Boys
Girls
Boys (Can't live with 'em)
Girls
Boys (Can't live without 'em)
Girls
Get nasty!
