C'mon, you're talking about it around the house
C'mon, uh, baby I love to hear your mouth
We've had a conversation, but you know that's just a fraction
What you wanna say about me
Is I'm all talk, and no action

C'mon, you hear me talking 'round the house
C'mon, you know you love to hear my mouth
Yeah, we've had a conversation, but you know that's just a fraction
Are you gonna let me say it?
Oh, you're all talk and no action

Anything you want, put it on your list
Baby life is like your store and it's alright
Just put it in your cart and I'm the one that would gladly pay and throw in the day, cause it's your night

I can feel it on your mind (on your mind)
I can feel it on your mind (on your mind)
I can feel it, it's alright (that's alright)
Can you feel it? It's our night

C'mon, you're talking about it around the house

Come and tell e what the fuss is about

Too late to walk it out
Gonna give you what you talk about
Make the cats and the dog run out
I'm gonna show you what I'm all about
Cause it's our night

C'mon, you're talking about it around the house
