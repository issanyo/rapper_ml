[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah
(yeah)
Here we go now
Yeah
(yeah)
Here we go now

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Play with us before we melt
Errybody enjoy yourself
The best part is the middle of me
I'm your sponge, baby, go on and squeeze

[Pre-Chorus 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm better than pillows, won't you believe me?
Squeeze me

[Chorus]
Squeeze me till I pop
Squeeze me till you drop
Yeah, here we go now
Yeah, here we go now

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Play with us before we melt
Errybody enjoy yourself
The best part is the middle of me
I'm your sponge, baby, go on and squeeze

[Pre-Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
I'm like cute aggression, won't you believe me?
Squeeze me

[Chorus]
Squeeze me till I pop
Squeeze me till you drop
Yeah, here we go now
Yeah, here we go now

[Verse 2: Shay]
Dang, dang, diggy-dang
Everybody the rain
Tell me shine like a chain
Wipe it up like a stain
Uppercut, yup again
A double dutch with Lil' Wayne
Do it till you vomit again
The job done now

[Pre-Chorus 3: Pharrell Williams]
So refreshing, won't you believe me?
Squeeze me

[Chorus]
Squeeze me till I pop
Squeeze me till you drop
Yeah, here we go now
Yeah, here we go now

[Verse 3: Shay]
Oh how, look at me now
Come again with the hot smile
Hydro glow style
Jelly fish with the hot gals
Adidas let me go far out
So you could be the superstar now
Get a big head that's round
Mrs. Puff-style

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Better than your teddy bear, won't you believe me?
Squeeze me

[Chorus]
Squeeze me till I pop
Squeeze me till you drop
Yeah, here we go now
Yeah, here we go now
