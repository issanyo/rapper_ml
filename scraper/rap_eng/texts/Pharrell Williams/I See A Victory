[Chorus:]
They'll call it a mystery
But we're gonna call it victory
We'll be writing history
It's gon' be victory
They'll be signs on top of signs
Just so you know the history
It's saying victory is with me

Oh let them laugh about it
Don't worry what the doubter's saying
Yes it's an uphill battle
But guess who else is playing
The next time ya'll in action
And the Ghost is in the room
Watch you work through the masses
You know that we've been used

[Pre-Chorus:]
Let go, let it be
No matter how deep
I swear just beneath
You'll find victory (find your victory)

[Chorus]

So I tallied all my losses
And I turned them into lessons
And what seemed to be less
I turned them into blessings
See, I'm not trying to lose you
But the Spirit is relentless
And when you let go, let Him use you
Then you too will be a witness

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
The Bible says you should pray for nothing
'Cause every week it's gon' be something
You know the devil can't wait to jump in
And complicate the things you trust in
But I know my foundation is solid
It can take some hating
Prayers go beyond the space station
On the way to the master's apron

[Chorus]
