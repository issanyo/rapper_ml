[Intro]
Grind hard far is today go
Yeah shine hard far is to pay go
Ball hard as far as they know
As far as they know

[Verse 1 - Pharrell]
She say "Why you dye your hair?", cause it's not alive
Get it, it has no life so it has to die
Plus I'm the mad hatter, your favorite actress back cracker
I know black hackers, and financial fat backers
But still I'm a back packer, who knows trappers
And gat packers, and eleven mac packers
There will be your life with a permanent dimple
Pussy is my teacher I'm a nympho for the info
Straight from my mental
I draw pictures upon my temple, Sharpie pen not pencil
I'm sorry now what I'm into, why I love all things that's oriental?
I'll take the golden diamonds and dip 'em all around my dental
Cause I like it bitch
If you knew that then I guess that means you psychic, shit
All the picky Cuban chain, right there's a bitch
You are out of your stature, watch what you ask for
Niggas you cannot break me crack me, or fracture
A scratch out of your zone tighten your corset
Comme Des Garcons, tuxedo short set with the bow tie
You know why, of course I am so high
All creativity, I'm comparable to no guy
Your girl says "Oh, hi!", look at her staring cute
You jump off a bridge, I'm still holding your parachute
You fly, right?

[Hook]
Grind hard far is today go
Shine hard far as the pay go
Ball hard as far as they know
As far as they know, oh
Grind hard far is today go
Shine hard far as the pay go
Ball hard as far as they know
As far as they know

[Verse 2] - Buddy
My intangibility mixed in with my agility
Seems to be the reason why most these niggas ain't feelin me
But their fragility mixed in with the virginity is like
The main reason why me in the manasili see
Simmy seems the most venomous spitter in the premises
Was crashed the mission to call you my nemesis
I'm a sinner, you can find me where are the sinners is use the beginner
I'm a section you are virginicies and see
Before you judge and get the talking you're talking just remember
You the defender so nigga you gon' have to surrender
Cause call me the number one contain the hell
And all the way from counting in my chain from Virginia
My birthday in September so she make sure she limber
And right before I chop it down I'll be screaming out "Timber!"
I'm the abominable biological diabolical
Take a look at my follicles if you're not frightened

[Hook to fade out]
