[Intro: Pharrell]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Yes, Sir... let's do it
Yes, Sir... hot... yo

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
On and on and, my nuts I'm palmin'
Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, "Cheers!"
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, "This is warfare," 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed liked my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now
Hello? Can you hear me now?

[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
On and on and, this beat is on and
I control their mind from straight over the phone
And let 'em explore the words, something like a tourist
And never get addicted unless that heady-wop is serious (Yes, Sir)
From Louisville to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition unless you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skate... board... P
Ladies and gentlemen

[Hook: Pharrell & Gwen Stefani]
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
So drop your purse and grab your hips (Uh huh)
And act like you tryin' to get this money right quick
So can I have it like that? (You got it like that)
Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
On and on and, the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
And should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where Iâ€™m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous, and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these little niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek
My name is Skate... board... P
