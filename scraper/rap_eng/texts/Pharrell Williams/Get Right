[Chorus]
Ma, don't waste your time
You with the wrong dude if you waitin' in line
Talkin' that balloon shit, soon to blow
We ain't mad at you, girl, you don't know
Look, don't let life stress you out
Tell me where you want, let me yes you out
Check the boards, ma, we put up numbers
Come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer

[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
Hair cut, car washed
And I'm Nautica down to the socks
Fortune 500 CEOs on the yacht
We don't talk about cash, we talk about stocks
Down in Miami, this is when it gets hot
I ain't there for them Heat, though, I'm here on the beach
To boats in the sea
The girls in the boats and the birds and the bees
We'll be here all week
We made a few songs
You might read about me in your new magazine
Bada-boom, bada-bing, homie
Need a loan, bad credit need funding
If I go to the club, I ain't gotta spend nothing
They got a table ready like "I hear Chuck's coming"
Impalas down Palace  like "I think a truck's running"
Five more Os sound like a nice budget
And five more of those, put 'em in a ice bucket

[Chorus]
Ma, don't waste your time
You with the wrong dude if you waitin' in line
Talkin' that balloon shit, soon to blow
We ain't mad at you, girl, you don't know
Look, don't let life stress you out
Tell me where you want, let me yes you out
Check the boards, ma, we put up numbers
Come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Ay, you on the fence now, you said you like who?
You never tried what? But you would like to
You goddam right you got a right to the high life
We in an elephant grey BMW M-1
The inside color of dim sum
Come ride with a nigga to the corner, we bend one
These rap niggas lyin' 'bout their salary income
I start a rap team, with all of that cream
That'd be harder than a gang member bat swing
A part of me wanna give you my last name
The other half of me wanna smash like a crash dummy
A lotta gold like a rap mummy
Got goals you supposed to live up to
Whole lotta hoes sayin' "Yo Mike, I wanna fuck you"
Little niggas sayin' "Yo Mike, what you been up to?"
Man, I'm just trying to stand out like a bucktooth

[Chorus]
Ma, don't waste your time
You with the wrong dude if you waitin' in line
Talkin' that balloon shit, soon to blow
We ain't mad at you, girl, you don't know
Look, don't let life stress you out
Tell me where you want, let me yes you out
Check the boards, ma, we put up numbers
Come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
Get right, come on, let's get right for the summer
