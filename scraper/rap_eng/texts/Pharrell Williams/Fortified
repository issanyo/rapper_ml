[Verse]
Water's boiling, the, rocks is calling
That desire inside of you is far from dormant
You only hear the smoke when you cross these lines
Up early in the mornin' like it's coffee time
We got the sharpest mind like we porcupines
Cross me in the desert and you'll see his eagle
Ain't no referee, and there ain't no free throws
It's all illegal, dire put equal
My fans smoke it up till they the size of Smeagol
Look at my hands, I'm the lord of the rings
Musical cocaine brought me all these things
Some nod, some bow, some throw up, some sing
The ill visual, I keep the watch visible
But the set invisible so you think that I'm kidding you
It's there but it's not there, you think that I'm shitting you
You see it but you can't believe it, so it's killing you
The 9/11, got the right chrome selected
Now it's looking just like a bullfrog pregnant
It don't how, yeah it dry
Call me David Blaine and ask me where is the time
Or ask this young nigga what it's like to ride in jets
Daytime it leave smoke like a backwards cigarette
At nighttime it look like it's just been lit, I bet
My set, is when my thumb is rubbing my index
Your girl told me tell your something right before she lick
You wanna know what she said
