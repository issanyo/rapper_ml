[Kid Ink]
Yeah, ok, we’re running through the city
Looking for the road of riches
Where we’re going in, no turning back
Didn’t think we’d make it this far
Missed some mighty, should have listen
It all made sense, but it wouldn’t pay attention to us!
Now, they can’t tell us nothing, we did it on our own
Gave everything I own, they told us we was wrong
Or can I say I just want more
Watch me take it with a four kicking at your door, oh!

[Cris Cab]
Burst through your roof, coming through your wall
We are living proof, you can do it all
And if you kinda run, you better win the race
Before you learn to walk, you gotta hit your face
And then you get back up, and take a step again
Joy is a piece of cake when you’re know how to play
And if they say you’re young, it means you just got it
And if they challenge you, here we go again!

Chorus:
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
We are, we’re young with our own directions
We work hard, for our plans’ protection
And so far, with the number one selection
Not bragging, you got a problem, then answer this question!
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?

Cris Cab
No matter who you are, or who you pretend to be
You gotta play your part in the society
You got to find your way, sometimes you turn wrong
And let me set you back and throw you ...
Right back to the top
So people say it’s lonely, trust me, no it’s not!
They wanna see you show, they wanna see you winning
Get yourself together, here we go again!

Chorus:
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
Hey, hey, here we go again
We are, we’re young with our own directions
We work hard, for our plans’ protection
And so far, with the number one selection
Not bragging, you got a problem, answer this question!
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?
Nothing!

[Kid Ink]
I swear to god i’ve been from hell and back
The black is hot where i’m from there ain’t not welcome back
Cause you ain’t welcomed here, but what can we do?
I need a refill, see my cup half filled
Here we go again, same old bullshit
Gotta keep my second tight like a corse
Fresh to death looking like corpses
Might take an L, but you never see me forfeit
Going hard to the it, work hard no lunch break
Now I run to town, used to run away from gun play
I’m just what the world maybe
Representing for the misfits, light it up in heavens

Chorus:
We are, we’re young with our own directions
We work hard, for our plans’ protection
And so far, with the number one selection
Not bragging, you got a problem, answer this question!
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?
What can we do? what can we do? what can we do?
Nothing!
