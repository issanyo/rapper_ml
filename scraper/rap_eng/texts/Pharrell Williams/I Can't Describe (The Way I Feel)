[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Hudson]
I feel like I'm in love
That is nice but not good enough
I feel like saying something that's for us, that defines what's in our hearts

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Dancing and we're playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Hudson]
This feels right, just staying up
And you don't describe when it's not
I can feel my heartbeat thumping from your touch
In my life you are my love

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)

[Interlude: Jennifer Hudson]
In the morning, hopefully you'll tell me why we're both yawning
But right now, think about it later, boy just love me now

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Wait a minute now
Come on Shawty, you already know 'bout me
In the summer Barcelona, Monaco I be
Kickin' flave on the gold coast, doin' the mo'
We poppin' gold bottles, twenty thousand a toast
In Ibiza you and me can take a walk on the moon
My watch got it showin' in the middle of June
And we can kick it on the water when it's hot in the street
On the yacht, somewhere South of Paris (Gettin' money)
I'll let you get the Black Card if you play you're right
Make you shine on sight, any day or night
I could never be as bad I just say I be
But I could be good if the wood be good
In the drop top, park downtown, gettin' to it
Let you have it like a true dope boy should
Let the neighbors all hear you when i'm doing something to it cause we wake em all up, cause we tear em all up

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
Dancing and we playin' around, you know you got me
And then the feeling comes raining down all over my body
It tingles here, tingles there, ooh it tingles everywhere
That's why I never found the words to describe it

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
I just can't put in words, what I feel for you (the way I feel, the way I feel)
It feels so good it hurts, what you do (the way I feel, the way I feel)

[Outro: Jennifer Hudson]
I can't describe (the way I feel, the way I feel)
Oh what a high (the way I feel, the way I feel)
