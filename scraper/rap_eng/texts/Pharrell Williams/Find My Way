I love you
You mean the world to me

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
Just a minute ago...
Just a minute ago...
Just a minute ago I said somethings I know
That I can't change that
But when I just screamed
That didn't mean for us to break
Break our pact

[Hook]
I'm searching for my way back
But I'm looking through a peep hole
I'm trying to find my way back
I wanna be your hero

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I'm here, you're there...
I'm here, you're there...
I'm here, you're there, between us is air
But no one is breathing
How can this be
It's your face I see
This is so crazy
We're in the same room

[Hook]
I'm searching for my way back
But I'm looking through a peep hole
I'm trying to find my way back
I wanna be your hero

I love you...forever

[Bridge]
I don't care what it takes
But I know we got to get there
We got to get there
I can see it now, you and me
I know nothing will change
If the both if us just sit here
If we just sit here
C'mon join me girl
Can't you see

[Hook 2x and fade]
I'm searching for my way back
But I'm looking through a peep hole
I'm trying to find my way back
I wanna be your hero
