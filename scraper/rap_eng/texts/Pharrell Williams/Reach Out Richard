[Verse 1]
Richard hello, I know it’s 4am on New Year’s Day
I never made it home last night, alright
I'm minor so they dropped the charge and I’ll be out today
I know that that won’t make it right
It’s never black and white but

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Richard, you taught me all I need to know
But there’s some things you can’t prepare for
All I ever want to do
Is be as good a man as you

[Chorus]
So don’t you be concerned, the kid’s alright
I’ve got to live and learn
The kid’s alright
I know that you will see
The kid’s alright
I’ll find my way eventually

[Verse 2]
Richard your tears fall on the wheel as you wipe them away
I’ve never seen you so far gone along
The snow is tumbling as you're wondering what you didn’t say
When I’m the one who got it wrong
I try to keep you calm, cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Richard you showed me what was wrong or right
But now I gotta live my own life
I will fall along the way
But I’ll remember what you said

[Chorus]
So don’t you be concerned, the kid’s alright
I’ve got to live and learn
The kid’s alright
I know that you will see
The kid’s alright
I’ll find my way eventually

[Bridge]
Woah woah
Reach out Richard
Woah woah
Reach out
Woah woah
Reach out Richard
Woah woah
Reach out

I know you see yourself inside my eyes
Oh-oh reach out
Richard don’t worry cause the kid’s alright
Oh-oh reach out
I gotta live and learn

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Richard you barely made it out of school
Well look at everything you’ve been through
Apples fall right from the tree
As long as you are here for me

[Chorus]
So don’t you be concerned, the kid’s alright
I’ve got to live and learn
The kid’s alright
I know that you will see
The kid’s alright
I’ll find my way eventually

[Chorus]
So don’t you be concerned, the kid’s alright
I’ve got to live and learn
The kid’s alright
I know that you will see
The kid’s alright
I’ll find my way eventually

[Outro]
The kid’s alright
The kid’s alright
