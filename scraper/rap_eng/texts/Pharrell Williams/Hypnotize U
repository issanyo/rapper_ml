[Intro]
I like you
You so special

[Verse 1]
Just close your eyes, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm behind you
Imagine you're on the beach and you're lost
And you feel the breeze because your clothes off
Your inhibitions you got nothin to hide
And then help 'em rise, do you wanna ride?

[Hook]
Touch it girl, touch it girl, touch it girl (ahh)
Touch it girl, touch it girl, touch it girl (ahh)
Touch it girl, touch it girl, touch it girl (ahh)
Touch it girl - I'm behind you!

[Verse 2]
Just close your eyes, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm inside you
I'm your doctor, this is your therapy
Your money's no good, just take care of me
I found out it's you, you my soldier type
But all that can change, let's get loose tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Just close your eyes, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm inside you
You're a dream
Inception you're my queen
White babe, let me paint that wall
Change the background, take that off
In your eyes I could see you a winner
I know size stop lyin like Lyor
You could stay but there'd be no me
But if you come then set you free

[Interlude]
To the left... to the right
To the left... to the right
Go on and touch it girl, go on and touch it girl
Go on and touch it girl, go on and touch it girl

[Pharrell]
Let me get close, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl if you're lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm behind you
Just close your eyes, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm inside you
[Outro]
Twenties, fifties, fives, tens
Twenties, fifties, fives, tens
Twenties, fifties, fives, tens
Twenties, fifties, fives, tens
Just close your eyes, let me hypnotize you
I can make your storm feel sky blue
Girl when you lost you know I'll find you
If I'm not beside you I'm inside you

[Hook]
