You can find me in the streets, even in a drought
My mattress is full, why shouldn't I be out?
Ay, buddy, I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good, what they tell ya?
I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good, what you see?

Four hundred dollar jeans with my favorite patch
Pulling up my ride, hell yeah the rims match
What that tell ya? I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see? Looking good

Man I'm killing it, riding in that brand new
Swimming through the streets, looking like I'm Shamu
In that big body with the wet paint
I got some pocket change from selling wet weight

Today is a good day, ice cubes on my chest
Looking at my Blackberry, freak, hit me on the text
Come and beat it up, I just need a minute
You can K ya ass, you ain't gotta lay in it, yes

Niggas don't like you when you lookin' good
Hate it when you shining through the neighborhood
Brand new ride, niggas know the time
Ho's cut they eyes, we call them samurais

Fly as I could ever be
A level of success that you could never see
You jealous mayne, we in propellas mayne
Think about it, ain't shit you could tell us mayne

You can find me in the streets, even in a drought
My mattress is full, why shouldn't I be out?
Ay, buddy, I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good, what they tell ya?
I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good, what you see?

Four hundred dollar jeans with my favorite patch
Pulling up my ride, hell yeah the rims match
What that tell ya? I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see?

You can test it out ma, tell me what you see
Order what you want, hell yeah it's on me
Don't it tell ya I'm good? What that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see? I'm looking good

Crusin' on them 22s, got me sittin' pretty
You should hear that engine purr, here kitty-kitty
Ride through the city, everybody know me
And the sun is out, it's like it's shinin' on me

Shoutin' out the homies as I breeze by
I'm on cloud 9, and I ain't even high
Told my shawty I'll be back, and I ain't even lie
Them VVS' be the best money can buy

I see you flirtin' baby, them jeans is painted on her
Mama looking right, and I don't even want her
No need to take it personal, but that just how it be
No disrespect to you, I'm just enjoying me

Finally I'm free, all my dues paid
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like it's Minute Maid
And I'm lookin' good, and I'm feeling good
Try and stop my shine, I wish a nigga would

You can find me in the streets, even in a drought
My mattress is full, why shouldn't I be out?
Ay, buddy, I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good, what they tell ya?
I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good, what you see?

Four hundred dollar jeans with my favorite patch
Pulling up my ride, hell yeah my rims match
What that tell ya? I'm good, what that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see?

You can test it out ma, tell me what you see
Order what you want, hell yeah, it's on me
Don't it tell ya I'm good? What that tell ya? I'm good
What they tell ya? I'm good, what she tell ya? I'm good
What you see?

I'm looking good, I'm looking good
I'm looking good, I'm looking good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm looking good, I'm looking good
I'm looking good, I'm looking good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm looking good, I'm looking good
I'm looking good, I'm looking good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm looking good, I'm looking good
Yeah, yeah, yeah
