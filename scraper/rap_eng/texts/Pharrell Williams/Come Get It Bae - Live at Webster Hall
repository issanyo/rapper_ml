You miss me?
I miss all of y'all, hey
All of you girls standin' together like that, I can't take it

Women, I can do anything you like
I can do anything you need
And I got a better body
Than the magazines you read

None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me

I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)

You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, 'cause girl I like you

I can see it the way you like
I can do anything you need
I can give you dirty looks
Like them niggas that's on TV

None of them boys know the first thing about your fantasy
And if they tried, they cannot do it just like me

I know you certainly been gone
And it's been much too long
And there's some things we need to do
So I know you need to get home

Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)

You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, 'cause girl I like you

There comes a time
When craving will grab your wrist
You'll need a sugar fix, baby

There comes a time
And you won't believe what you'll do
When that sugar's callin' you

Girl, this is show time
This is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E
Satisfaction guaranteed

And there will come a time
This is where you wanna be
'Cause it's everything you need
You were lonely mindin' me

Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)

Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)
Come get it bae (hey)

You wanna ride it, my motorcycle
You've got a license, but you got the right to
Gonna pop a wheelie, don't try too high too
Take it easy on the clutch, 'cause girl I like you

(Hey) wait a minute
(Hey) wait a minute
(Hey) wait a minute
