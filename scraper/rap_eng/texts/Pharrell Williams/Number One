Yesterday I was half the man you see
Baby thats because you the other half of me

For my number 1 I keep ya dumb fly
Fresh to death you like after death

Now we Fresh as a Prince while they Jazzy Jeff
And you don't be sayin shit when they askin questions
A-a-and you be givin' me my space a-a-and
You don't be runnin' on MySpace a-a-and
You know some other shit I hate w-w-what

Tonight man I ain't in the mood for it
Don't matter who wore it, you wore it
Look how ya co-or-dinated man that's my favorite
