[Chorus: Benny Boy]
When you see a plane, better think of me
When it comes to freshest, and no question that it's I
If you bite me style, better sink your teeth
Cause I'm looking flashy, get some glasses for your eyes
A thousand people love me, a couple people hate me
It's because the girl they love went and tried to date me
Way before this music thing, they forgot my name, see
But lately, everybody's been saying this
(pose for the camera man)

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
When I'm posing for the snapshot, I always say cheese
If everybody gets a pic, man it could take weeks
When haters try to catch a glimpse and I know they hate me
I'm like hold up, wait, yo pictures ain't free
You still want the photo? Fine you can get a pic
I know he's just a hater so I smile just a little bit
All these fake people, frankly I am just sick of it
I hate all of my haters so I am a hypocrite
Get it? Got it? Good then
Cause back before I used to hold the camera and I took them
Was lucky if I ever got a foot in
But I've been getting pics, I'ma beat Rod Woodson
If you run a post, I will intercept
Unless of course you post it up on the internet
And with my next line, I don't  mean no disrespect
But I've been getting more shots than Virginia Tech

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
When you see a plane, better think of me
When it comes to freshest, and no question that it's I
If you bite me style, better sink your teeth
Cause I'm looking flashy, get some glasses for your eyes
A thousand people love me, a couple people hate me
It's because the girl they love went and tried to date me
Way before this music thing, they forgot my name, see
But lately, everybody's been saying this
(pose for the camera man)
(pose for the camera man)
(pose for the camera man)
(pose for the camera man)
(pose for the camera man)
(pose for the camera man)

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
I rep my crew, and you know what?
It's Boy Brigade, we won't grow up
So sick, on sight you will throw up
Girls love my (shhhh) Two girls one cup
They cut my wings off, that was why I crawled
The flyest ever period, Midol
Ayo I got it, check it out, I'm so fly y'all
I'm chilling on a little African's eyeball
Hip Hop, hold it down
And the ice creams, y'all already know it now
I'm hot man, I need to tone it down
I'm on fire y'all, stop drop roll around
Doubt me, or if you decide no
My career will work out like it was on Tae Bo
See you at the top y'all, this is bye bye yo
Up up and away is what I say cause I'm fly so

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
When you see a plane, better think of me
When it comes to freshest, and no question that it's I
If you bite me style, better sink your teeth
Cause I'm looking flashy, get some glasses for your eyes
A thousand people love me, a couple people hate me
It's because the girl they love went and tried to date me
Way before this music thing, they forgot my name, see
But lately, everybody's been saying this
