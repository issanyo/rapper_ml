[Verse 1]
Sitting here in this white padded room
Imagining I'm a meteor flying out through the distant space
How does tiny speckle Earth destroy tommorow?
So capable of so many things, why make life taking planes?
But I believe that when you lose your route
Choose the sunlight, it could be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?

[Verse 2]
Can't you see? This is "The Truman Show", baby
Cause when they fight, who dies is you
Hold, if you unscrew me, we've got the same gear and same tools
But how you gon' catch it witcha head hanging down?
Whatcha see staring at the ground?
But I believe, even without a clue
You've got sunlight, and it can be your guide
No more political dreams, not another excuse
Don't need another love song, we need a love bomb

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to unbind a few
By removing propaganda but
They must have used the devil's superglue
I'm trying to take the machine apart, yeah
What I'm simply trying to do
Is have the reason to take a pause
I've been down every avenue
But everybody's building's gone

[Chorus]
To just blow us away, to freaking blow the lights out
Turning night to day, hear it from miles away
Just to make it right now, fuck what the government say
We gotta save some lives now, is that okay?
