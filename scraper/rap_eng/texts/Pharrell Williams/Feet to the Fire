[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Gonna hold your feet to the fire
You've got to answer
For what you say
Don't wanna be seen as a lie
Lie
Girl, you've got to find
A better way
Cause I've been through it
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Come here
We started in my apartment dreamin'
Asleep and it's not in season
Gotta find you some motivation
Don't let life pass by ya
Yeah
So I be wakin' up in the mornings
Eyes still closed from yawin'
Driving you to the station
So you can put out fires
All of a sudden you get promoted
Of course you know good friends
Are gloatin'
Then, in order
It's like you're floatin'
Yeah, you're the man
That was about five years ago
But you got the muthafuckin' nerve
To show up
Talkin' bout one more chance
You know what?
Nah, nah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Gonna hold your feet to the fire
You've got to answer
For what you say
Don't wanna be seen as a lie
Lie
Girl, you've got to find
A better way
Cause I've been through it
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
So then she moved
From Virginia
To Miami with her friend but
To her itâ€™s just vacation
You know K, she aspires, higher
She concentrates on her business
You going through her social media pictures
See some niggas ask, "What's the occasion?"
But she's not the liar?

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland & (Pharrell Williams)]
I got to think about
Five years later
Why do you care about who I'm dating?
Yeah, it's a burning hot contemplation
But know what?
Do you remember putting out my fires?
We'd lay their and talk about when you retire
(Damn)
But you probably got too many hoes

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
Gonna hold your feet to the fire
You've got to answer
For what you say
Don't wanna be seen as a lie
Lie
Girl, you've got to find
A better way
Cause I've been through it
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over and over
Over
