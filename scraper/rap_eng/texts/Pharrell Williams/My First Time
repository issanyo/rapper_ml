All in all you've been there for me
You showed me things I would never see
I think I'm ready
By my side you been waitin'
Respectfully and oh so patient
I think I'm ready

Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

[Chorus]

But it's my first time
And baby, I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead but it's my first time
And baby, I'm not afraid to go the way
But it's my first time
And baby I know you wanna change the speed
And I'ma let you take the lead remember it's my first time

Hold me tight 'cause I'm about to burst
I think I'm ready
I feel it in my chest as I dance with you
Got so much control you haven't made a move
You give me reassurance in the things you do
And that's why
I think I'm ready

Remember your first time
It's my first time)
