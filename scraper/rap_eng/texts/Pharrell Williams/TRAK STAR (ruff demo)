[Intro]
Ho!

[Verse 1]
I got a crush on you
I feel that you feel it to
I know this came out the blue
But girl, you keep me inside, locked away
Oh, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think, "what's above us?"
The stars won't stay tonight
They all know about us
I can't keep you off my mind
I can't make the promise
The stars my not fall
But I'll be there and my love you will find
(you know!)

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Stay the night
Don't run with my love
It's your light

[Verse 2]
It's the little things
That make me reminisce about  you
And what we could have been
If you would quit denying the truth, girl
(you know i been feeling you for a long time
And i couldn't be the only one...)
It's all good... all good...
C'mon!

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think, "what's above us?"
The stars won't stay tonight
They all know about us
I can't keep you off my mind
I can't make the promise
The stars my not fall
But I'll be there and my love you will find
(you know!)

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Stay the night
Don't run with my love
It's your light
X7
Stay the night
Stay the night
Don't run with my love...
(Ay!)

[Bridge]
You know you ain't gotta leave
This is our world, yes
We'll see it all, whippin
While we swerve in the Lex
With the top down,bumping N*E*R*D in the deck
What's it gon' take to get you outta of that dress?
I can hear you saying, "Just friends"
But I can see more, lemme show you romance
Gaze at the stars, wave while we hold hands
I'd give it all to you, if you give me one chance
Don't run away

[Leon Thomas & Ace Hashimoto]
Trak star... (Don't run away!)
Trak star... (Don't run away!)
Trak star... (Don't run away!)
Trak star...
Trak star... (Don't run away!)
Trak star... (Don't run away!)
Ooooo.... ( Don't run away!)

[Chorus]
Stay the night
Stay the night
Don't run with my love
It's your light
