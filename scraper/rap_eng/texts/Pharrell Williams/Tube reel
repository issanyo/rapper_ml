[verse 1:keylime]
Check it
Shorty want whipped cream
Call me captain cum blast
I'm a walking dream
The competition live in overlapped
Live & laugh
Scoop & dash
The loop & crash
Synthesizer cash
Beat consumed my soul and i had the nerve to laugh
When i made a track
Been to hell more than four times
Thats where i rap
Like a bat
Flying in the void
I'm a old boy
Know that i strike with noise
Shorty wanna mingle
Wanna catch some joy
Being all the fuss
With a shag and rare apparel
You should call this fallout cause apparently i'm feral
Ambition of a cat
Potential flow like a water tap
Style been loco gave the world another heart attack
Oh my lord oh my he's done it again
Gift wrap a rap and serve it to kids
Know keylime dont trust these pigs
In my room making tunes just being me
Can't sleep at all i'm running on dreams
I got so many themes
But i'm not a people person
Bet when i see a culo movin in slow motion
Ima have to slide thru
And give her the word
If she got a man i'll school him like a nerd
I'm absurd  wild atomic hot no mild
Had bars since i was climbing up aisles
I would go an extra mile into that
But im trynna load this track
With lyrical snaps
Steady duckin tryna flap with the flock
The geese here squash beef with hands never do the talk
You a goofy boa trynna scoop the guap
You a corny boa frito chip in the guac
Big booty hoe and her friend lobbin top
If anything bo' my footprints be the spot
Sporting gear thats not made in sweatshops
I might as well be kept in the box
Lethal wave makin fools drown cause they flop
Always sedimented cause i rock
Yet im still up the charts
Scrappin wit land sharks
Leap up to the podium
The come up will be prescribed with pharmaceuticals and pneumonia
Cause im so cold
Got bars for days
Ima make them gold
And laced
With rubies
It was all lame then she told me papi bloop me
My homies loony
This beat groovy
Im zooming
Tube reel
When i roll down the sun
Throw the roses
I'm doing this for fun
I'm recreating moses
I'll let you catch my load when you know how to throw throat
Been the shit since i dyed coats
If you want to be real i'll let my yellow stiletto hit your nose
If you scared be real hit the hills and kneel be a joke
If you want to be real just exist in a haux
Im standing on my ten toes
If you want to be real just serve when i host
How many hoes you gotta have to show boat
Im in flossy material i made original on my own
Better go home when i wanna run a game of skate or pop off a cypher
Im death in every genre of competition i got my cythe and a typewriter
In over my head i'm the best while recording
Technically i'm the best in my room so i'm important
In the eye of the forest
I'm the ruler of the fortress
Distressed denim and a tank top
The women want more of this
Maybe the tape won't stop
This tube reel
Spread the word while i fall to the summit
Some won't stomach this
My bars are flourishing
Hop on the beat and i'm morphing
