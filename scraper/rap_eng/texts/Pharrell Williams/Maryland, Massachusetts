[Hook]
She just wanna party and I just wanna parlay
Hello Mrs. Dolly, I got something for your body
She gon Google music, ain't nobody stupid
Maryland, Massachusetts, call me Maryland, Massachusetts
You know she love that
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
You know she love that
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
You know she love that
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts
Maryland, Massachusetts, Maryland, Massachusetts

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on the Rollie, you call that Rico Love
When I hold it up it turn the lights on
Shawty wanna fuck, lollipop homez
She can get it all, butt naked with my Nikes on
No NBA tho, but I shoot the trey tho
I pull up from the line like OJ- Mayo
Keep a bad bitch from St. Louis to Vallejo
And yo bitch don't exist (Manti-Te'o)

[Bridge]
Oooo, this ain't ecstasy
Yea, see I got something you gon like it
Depending on how you like it
How happy and how excited is decided by where I bite it
Oooo, ain't nothing better than me
Ah girl, King Scorpio, quote that
Pour that, roll that, and blow that
Come and get it girl now
And I'm a guy like Shawty know that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Aye, Hey Shawty I got what you need yea
I get it poppin, drop you to your knees yea
My pleasure, yea I aim to please yea
God blessed ya and you ain't even sneezed yea
Girl I'll take you down down thru thurr
Mile high Shawty, you ever did it when you flew air?
Flew her, I knew her
I swooped her and I cooped her
And I looked her, and I dooked her
But I called back, I dook her

[Bridge]
