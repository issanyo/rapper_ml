No I know you don't know
Just how hard for you I go
So look, You ain't gotta leave
But I know everybody go
So when you do no don't you call
Don't you call on my phone
You always tryna FaceTime
N make sure I ain't wit no hoes
So you ain't even gotta call
You should already know
Know that I'm wit the em all
Although its not me at all
I be trynna get over you
Like you can't miss what you replace
I still don't know if it's true
I hate love and I still fall
For the same old tricks
It's the same old game
With the same old bitch

Swear you never fucking change
I kinda love you for that
You only say you love me back

You only say you love me back
You never show it and that's wack
I'm not saying massage my back
I'm just saying, cut me some slack
Cause we know that I been slackin
