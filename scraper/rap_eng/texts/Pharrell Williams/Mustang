[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like "daaang"
Will you take me for a spin?
Beep beep

[Verse 1]
What is just happening?
Who is this guy?
I think he really turns me on
Everything is classic, no need to ask why
Where do I sign? I'm gone

Like where was he raised?
What kind of game he plays?
Well, none would be my choice
I ask him 'bout his swagger
He didn't knew what that was
He said it sounds like swagger is for boys

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy likes you
You make me feel alive
My daddy likes you
I'd never say goodbye
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

So why did you throw a fit?
My daddy likes you
You cursed a little bit
My daddy likes you
I still put up with your shit
But my daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like daaang
Will you take me for a spin?
Beep beep

[Verse 2]
Hard to imagine it
We build up all this passion
We found baby is what I am on
Cruising all and crashing
I can't believe is lasting
I think it really turns me on
Nothing too dramatic
The love is gymnastics i'm fliping
Baby yeah I'm gone
Dancing 'till the morning
Lightning up and pouring
And trust me you ain't like other boys

[Pre-Chorus]
My daddy likes you
You make me feel alive
My daddy likes you
I'd never say goodbye
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

So why did you throw a fit?
My daddy likes you
You cursed a little bit
My daddy likes you
I still put up with your shit
But my daddy likes you
My daddy likes you
My daddy likes you

[Chorus]
You drive a classic Mustang
The ones with the stock wheels you didn't change
Plus it has a new system that bangs
It makes me say “daaang”
Will you take me for a spin?
In your classic Mustang
Make your driveway look like a picture frame
Plus you got that nice leather with no stains
Smell like daaang
Will you take me for a spin?
