[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Now when the phone start to click in, your words start to echo
Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing up
I never thought I'd had have to question "Were you man enough?"
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying...

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that...

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
