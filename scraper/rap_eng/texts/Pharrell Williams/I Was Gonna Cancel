[Verse 1]
I was gonna cancel
Then I looked into the sky
And knew the bad news won't prevent the sun to shine
I was gonna cancel
Then took a sec to realize
All the disappointment that would trail behind
I was gonna cancel
Then you reminded me of who I am
Everything is clearer than a mirror is to woman
Just the same as a dog is to man

[Chorus]
Just hop out of the bed, (hey)
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Shut out all the doubt, (hey)
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go girl

[Verse 2]
I was gonna cancel
Then I thought about the strength that
I got from all of the prayers and what it meant
I was gonna cancel
Then I realized that time is just like money and love
Watch how you spend
I was gonna cancel
Until you reminded me of what I do
Now I see it clearer
My best friend is a mirror look behind me
And I see all the things I've been through

[Chorus]
Just hop out of the bed, (hey)
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Shut out all the doubt, (hey)
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go girl

[Bridge]
What's wrong with saying I love you?
It's nothing to kid about
Some people going through a struggle
Trying to scribble it out
They say attention is a shovel
It's time to dig 'em out
You can't just let them stay in a bubble
They'll pop to get it out

What's wrong with love, love?
What's wrong with love, love?

[Chorus]
Just hop out of the bed, (hey)
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way
Shut out all the doubt, (hey)
Just get up and go
What's on the other side? (Yeah)
You will never know unless you
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go-o-o
Go, go, go, go girl
