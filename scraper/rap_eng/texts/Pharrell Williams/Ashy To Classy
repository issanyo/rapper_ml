That's right
I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now
I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

That's right
I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you see me now
A nigga pocket so swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home
Ballin' outta control

Started out a little young nigga, 'bout 15
Tryin' to figure out ways to get big green
Had dreams of rock gleams
Top down on the old school
Cause the hustla's ridin' clean looked so cool

You know the rules, I got in where I fit in
Why not hit the block, all my other brothers did it
Had to get out there and get it on my own
Cause when you turn 16, nowadays you grown

Mama did her best, cause I never missed a meal
But I'm tired of takin' money
That shit needed for bills, you feel me?
I'm tryin' to take a little weight up off her back
So I'm takin' up the slack, thanks to feens wantin' crack
A 50 pack, to a half, to a whole
To be 15 nigga, my pockets on swoll'
Huh
I'm finally bout to get my chance to go pro
And let the city know Slim thug gettin' dough

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now
I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

That's right
I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you see me now
A nigga pocket so swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home
Ballin' outta control

Now I'm the one ridin' clean, Just made 17
But I ain't' satisfied with the cash the block bring
And them law snatchin niggas off the block every night
Cause boys treatin' this shit cause it's a normal 9 to 5
Instead of trying to put their paper in a row
These niggas on the block hustlin' till they get caught
But a, my mama didn't ain't no fool
I had to chill for a minute and just focus on school
And if I wasn't in the hall gettin' ho's
I was chillin' wit my niggas spittin flows
Next thing you know I'm at the club doin' shows
And gettin' bank rolls when I step through the doors
My pussy rate at an all-time high
And ain't too much shit that I want I can't buy
I'm livin' good, everyday stay fly
I guess that's why the niggas in the hood say hi

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now
I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

That's right
I went from ashy to classy, to glassy
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you see me now
A nigga pocket so swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home
Ballin' outta control

Nowadays I'm a made man
And word is Slim thug is a very well paid man
I'm raybanned up, top down, mashing
Lookin in the rearview at the haters that I'm passin'
So please stop with them questions you askin'
I'm a hustla, I'ma stay smashing
Quarter million dollar cars, I'm livin' like a star
VIP with the bar, players buyin' out the bar
And even though a nigga didn't shoot hoops
I still found ways to make NBA loot
A young nigga got his pockets on swoll'
They can't stahnd to see a young nigga home
Ballin' outta control

I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you hear me now
I can barely hear you
Mother fuckers too far in my rearview

That's right
I went from ashy to classy, to classic
Quarter million dollar car
You can't pass me
Haters can you see me now
A nigga pocket so swoll'
They can't stand to see a young nigga home
Ballin' outta control ...
