[Hook](x2)
I was gettin some head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was wit the kinda girl that make ya toes pop

[Verse 1]
Ridin' with a bitch I call hot mouth Shelly
She pop them ecstasies and get that cottonmouth heavy
I give her a bottle of water bitch break out sweatin'
And then she get straight to that head like a fuckin' excedrin
I'm a fly ass nigga take a look at me bitch
Now ho go and tell the cops I gotta crook in my dick
Straight gut a bitch open like a hook in a fish
I got a lady from Paris that french kiss my shit
Yea why you think I gotta tint my whips
'Cause I be gettin' some head, right in my shit
You say you love that woman, but that been my bitch
And if you kiss that woman, than you suck my dick
These hoes is nasty, y'all niggas is trippin'
I got a bitch with her mouth like that boy Ken Griffey
When I'm out in the streets better believe I'm pimpin'
And if you ever saw me with one of them video vixens

[Hook]
I was gettin' some head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was gettin' some head head
Gettin', gettin' some head
I was wit the kinda girl that make ya toes pop
Super head what's good? Super head what's good? Super head what's good?

[Verse 2]
You know me I smoke a blunt while I'm gettin' brain
Stick my finger in her butt while I'm gettin' brain
Yeah I'm nasty bitch! What? Lil Wayne!
I liked them Mac'd up lips and two tongue rings
I gotta say it I'm the President I run things
All these hoes tryna save a nigga cum stains
Real talk I get head I get head on the airplane
Bitch be climbin' all over that little chair thang
I pull her hair back
She holla yeah back
I like a bitch wit some lips like a bear trap
And I don't mind goin' down I take care of that
I have homie at home like where she at?
She wit me in my bad ass ride
Givin' me a blow job like a 9-5
She said she eat her vegetables so she stay alive
So she slobbed on my knob
Like corn on the cob

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
I mean I make her fiend for that dick
They be pumping the P, P be pumping 'em
Look at they ass they gotta tell me just go
You ain't fucking with me when it come to these hoes
Bust fast across they chin
What I'm saying to them man I don't pretend
Push one button, and the chrome (?) ducking
Keep it going like the grill on the (?)
She's a freak she want D's and some (?)
Show her keys and the skirt'll go and shirt'll go
She say I hurt her tho, in the cervical
She being murdered tho, give her vertical
Baller G ain't no apology
Wanna have a couple words better call a G
Man I seen your sports car but it's smaller B
The Enzo's outside for you all to see
Look at my chains, look at my rings
Rocks and watches, bracelet plain
Keepin' it going, with a brick a day
Can't compare so you just complain
Mad as a bitch, grabbing ya bitch
Get OJ start stabbing ya bitch
I'm Macy here's a cab for ya bitch
Call me on my niggas shit beg and laugh at ya bitch
A.C., gotta stay cool mane
Never let 'em see you sweat that's the rule mane
Hit her till we through mane
Send her back to you mane
That's what we do mane
Bubble gum chew mane
Other than that catch me getting some bread
If you see my billboards I be getting some head
