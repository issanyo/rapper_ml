[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Too much to bear

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Like a shark
(Superpower)
Too much to bear

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down

[Outro: Beyoncé & (Frank Ocean)]
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
