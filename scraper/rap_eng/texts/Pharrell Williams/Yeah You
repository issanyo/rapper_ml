[Verse 1]
Yeah; I was at a show
Backstage untying my shoes
There was your friend from Wireimage
Standing beside her was you
And Nigo told me don't do it
My nice image would go up in fumes
But the head without the ears heard it
So you end up in my room

[Hook]
Textin' me a hundred times, callin' me a hundred times
Hope it is not you this time, damn I gotta change my line
Textin me you're gonna die, call the psychiatric line
Friends and family should know why, reportin' this as a crime
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I said I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout
I bet you heard this song wanna know who I'm talkin' 'bout--YOU!

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

[Verse 2]
And on those frustrated nights
E-mails that could evoke tears (I like you, I like you)
(I love you, I think I'm dying)
My friend asked me for your e-mail address
She said she'd take it from here
She said she'd tried to walk you through the picture
(He doesn't like you)
But for you nothing is clear (why?)
Now she too is frustrated and damn
That's been a year

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

[Interlude: Shay]
As you listen to this song
I hope your thought process evolves
It's not your reasoning that's wrong
Its that deep down everything is gone
The place is empty, no lights on
Instead happiness should be sprawled
Across the face of your heart's wall
But you'll press pause and you'll just call
{*phone dialing*}

[Repeat 2X]
Awww baby, you can't help yourself

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
Hoo-hoo
Yeah baby!

YOU~!

The saxophone makes my head hurt
