Girl you don't know what you are to me
You are my baby doll
You are my compass star
You drive me up the wall
Girl you don't know what you mean to me
You are my everything
You are my alien
From S-p-a-c-e

[Hook x3:]
Please don't go
Wait
I just met you

Girl I feel just like a bird
Though I am just a nerd
I could fly around this world
With power from this word
We'll bring the desert rain clouds
Fuck reality and doubt
Well they'll be vultures I see
They'll chase me
Girl I'm flying with thee

Roses are red
Yellow and white
Where have you been all my life
Violets are blue
And I’ll be too
If you leave
Cause I just met you

[Hook]

You're my pop rocks
You're my cotton candy
When the beach is hot n sandy
You're my water
You're my morning shower
Sub-conscious melody
You're my lsd
Summer's perfect daughter

[X3]
Roses are red
Yellow and white
Where have you been all my life
Violets are blue
And I'll be too
If you leave
Cause I just met you

[X4]
I’m Sorry
But I got to
Got to go
I gotta go

I just met you
