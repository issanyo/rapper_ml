[Verse 1]
Say which flavor you like and I'll have it for you
Come on into my store, I've got candy galore
Don't pretend you're not hungry, I've seen it before
I've got turkish delight baby and so much more

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up out of your seat (Your seat)
Come on up to the dancefloor
I've got something so sweet (So sweet)
Come on up to the front door
I need plenty of heat (Heat)
Form a special confection
Just start moving your feet (Your feet)
Move on over to me

[Chorus]
I'll be your one stop (One stop)
Candy shop (Candy shop)
Everything (Everything)
That I got (That I got)
I'll be your one stop (One stop)
Candy store (Candy store)
Lollipop (Lollipop)
Have some more (Have some more)

Ooh la la...

[Verse 2]
All the suckers are not what we sell in the store
Chocolate kisses so good
You'll be beggin' for more
Don't pretend you're not hungry
There's plenty to eat
Come on in to my store
'Cause my sugar is sweet

[Pre-Chorus]
Get up out of your seat (Your seat)
Come on up to the dancefloor
I've got something so sweet (So sweet)
Come on up to the front door
I need plenty of heat (Heat)
Form a special confection
Just start moving your feet (Your feet)
Move on over to me

[Chorus]
I'll be your one stop (One stop)
Candy shop (Candy shop)
Everything (Everything)
That I got (That I got)
I'll be your one stop (One stop)
Candy store (Candy store)
Lollipop (Lollipop)
Have some more (Have some more)

[Post-Chorus]
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)
My sugar is raw (Sticky and sweet)

[Bridge]
Put your hands all over my body (Dance)
Put your hands all over my body (Dance)
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic, erotic
Erotic, erotic
Put your hands all over my body
Erotic... (Aow)

[Chorus]
I'll be your one stop (One stop)
Candy shop (Candy shop)
