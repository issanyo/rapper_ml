[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Honey said she wanted somebody break her off proper (mhm)
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey girl)
Because it's so awesome how she moves her body (ow)
She sang the wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin 'it up (mixin' it up)
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you blush

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I know, I know, I know, I know that you want my body, huh
And you want to control my mind, huh
And everyone wants to own it
But nobody can, alas!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams with Camila Cabello]
Honey said she wants somebody break her off proper
Man, she so relentless so nothing can stop her (woo)
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (yeah!)
Because it's so awesome how she moves her body
She sang the wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine, yeah (uh-huh)

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
(One) Wait a minute
(Two) Wait a second
(Three) What, what?
Turbo sauce (woo!)

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello]
Let's float around like the fruit at the top (huh)
In Miami, where winters are hot

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I know, I know, I know, I know that you want my body, huh
And you want to control my mind, huh
And everyone wants to own it
But nobody can, alas! (noo)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello, Pharrell Williams & Both]
Honey said she wants somebody break her off proper
Man, she is so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never left the city (come on, man) but she swear she's a yardie (hey darling)
'Cause it's so awesome how to move my body
She sang the wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Moving side to side (woo), front and behind (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), sangria wine (uh-huh)
Sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine, yeah (uh-huh)

[Outro]
What what?
