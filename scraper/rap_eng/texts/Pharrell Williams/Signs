[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping, VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg with Justin Timberlake]
Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncing cars
You wit you friend right? (Yeah!)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right? (No!)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake + Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G!

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Mami, mamacita, have you ever flown on G5s
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson + Justin Timberlake]
(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, and I don't see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll, you ain't no G!

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Ooh wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!
Ooh wee!! Heeeeeee, hey!
