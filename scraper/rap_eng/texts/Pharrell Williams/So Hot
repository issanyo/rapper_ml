[Verse 1]
I've got to get out of my way
I'm blocking myself from love
It's like self sabotage
I guess 'cause Im afraid
Of being below the level that I think successful
That's the scary part
Of messing up with you
I pick the hardest ways
That I can think off
Sitting in my garage
Haven't started my car for days
I get nervous, it's just that I like things perfect
That's the scary part
Of messing up with you
Because you're...

[Chorus]
So hot
So, so hot
So hot
So, so hot
All my friends tell me
That I'm bugging, I should focus
'Cause he's so hot
So, so hot

[Verse 2]
God had a lot of days, yeah
And it never wouldn't budge
Just thinking should I call
Once again in the Virgo maze
I hope you don't think it is a mess, you'll see, it's special
That's the scary part
Of messing up with you
You seek my heart is stained
With the residue of love
My phobia's a fall
For a guy and then get played
'Cause the last guy ain't deserved it, that just serves
This was the scary part
And I facing that with you
Since you're...

[Chorus]
So hot
So, so hot
So hot
So, so hot
All my friends tell me
That I'm bugging, I should focus
'Cause he's so hot
So, so hot

[Bridge]
Somebody follow me
Somebody retweet this love
If they make you feel like all guys so far
And you just wanna go so hard
Somebody follow me
Somebody retweet this love
If they make you feel like all guys so far
And you just wanna go so hard

[Verse 3]
Okay, I bet by now
You;re wondering what is freaking me out
I know there's fish in the sea, but I know I would lose
They're not you
'Cause if at the end of the day, if I'll play
And my chance washed away
The world would be my bait, my one and honest gun
Looking for some treasure, I be washed up and alone

[Chorus]
So hot
So, so hot
So hot
So, so hot
All my friends tell me
That I'm bugging, I should focus
'Cause he's so hot
So, so hot

[Bridge]
Somebody follow me
Somebody retweet this love
If they make you feel like all guys so far
And you just wanna go so hard
Somebody follow me
Somebody retweet this love
If they make you feel like all guys so far
And you just wanna go so hard, so hard

[Chorus]
So hot
So, so hot
So hot
So, so hot
All my friends tell me
That I'm bugging, I should focus
'Cause he's so hot
So, so hot
