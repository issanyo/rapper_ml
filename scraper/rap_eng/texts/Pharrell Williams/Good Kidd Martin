Breaking down some herb
To stimulate my mind
Hoping I'm not wasting time
Spittin lyrics when I could be chasing dimes
That's how my mind works
But I can put on a suit and tie
Go Rob a bank and show you how crime works
Like I'm above em all
And that's including the law
Just another slave to society
Pardon my irony
Button up shirt, need some ironing
But I rather iron hoodies
It's about who's inside of it
Something that they never care about
Judge a book by its cover
I mean his skin color
Another brother taken from his mother
That's everyday in the hood
BecAuse we act up
Toss ties instead we ski masked and blacked up
That's why we looked down on
My skin is frowned on
No respect to my ancestors who had crowns on
This one for trayvon, sean bell and Ama-do...
Rodney took a beating that was better than a bullet wound

Good kid
Mad city
Where they never showin pity
Asking all my brothers
Drop ya weapons
And let's stop the killing
Looking at a corpse
After shots hit, of course
We just killing one another
No remorse to each other
I'm a sinner in my own ways
Forget my old days
We make mistakes everyday
Till we in old age
And even then we need to listen
For the knowledge that we're missing
We should always be forgiven

Bullets enter the chamber
No slavery
Breaking free
Once the triggers squeezed
All you feel is heat
You as the shooter
Get this evilness into you
Or as victim
You laying there feeling heat from earth center
Like cowards...
You see a weapon as power
Tough appearance but you are softer than any flower
I'm hip to the younger crowd coppin a Dutch
Rather that than them coppin something they have to clutch
In my generation
The man is waiting, steady levitatin
For us to kill each other or end up incarcerated
I'm here to spread the message
You need to count ya blessing
Government ain't helping
And the system ain't too welcoming
Less you got wealthy friends
That ain't the case
Judges look you in ya face and they judge you by ya race
Such a slap in the face to my people
We all carry brains
But don't use em, it's illegal...

Good kid
Mad city
Where they never showin pity
Asking all my brothers
Drop ya weapons
And let's stop the killing
Looking at a corpse
After shots hit, of course
We just killing one another
No remorse to each other
I'm a sinner in my own ways
Forget my old days
We make mistakes everyday
Till we in old age
And even then we need to listen
For the knowledge that we're missing
We should always be forgiven
