You know I had to do this one
Haha
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I said, "What's up?" She said, "Not these!"
Now her panties are below her knees
You know what comes next
It rhymes with x
And x is where we all will find the booty
She a real fine cutie
I like white girls cause they taste just like vanilla
And them latina girls, ooh that taste is so familiar
All my black girls taste like bubble gum
Asian girls just love to cum
Cruising in my Chevy and smoke til eyes get heavy
Cruising real slow as we let the music bang
Laughing at you stupid lames
Cause you ain't' came up in my lane
You ain't' made a got dam change
All the same and I'm trying to get a rang, like LeBron
Put me on, any song
See it in the graveyard where it says dates all it says is "Not too long"
Uh!
Stoney Wright, that's me
Nasty guy, came on her face and ass cheek
Only met her like last week
LB, that's my dog
My mouth a pistol and I'll blast you all
Never play so don't pass the ball
Go bananas, you apple sauce
Uh
Never snitch, fuck pigs
My homies bang, drum sticks
Smoking weed, lung rips
Make a chick do tongue tricks
Her clothes off, I'm unzipped
No blurred line, blurred vision
Smoked two joints, the third twisting
I'm so fly the birds listen
Homeboy said he got a bird but man that bird different
Drug slang
I got charisma that I can you can't obtain
Popping in pills till I'm dozing off
Spit crack when ya'll going soft
Corpus Christi my next home
Lil' rappers get stepped on
Meridian is still my town
Best believe I put shit down
You hear me now so I'm going out, of my way
This ain't' an album it's a mixtape
Killing this shit by Robin Thicke
I got these hoes but not all em thick
I like skinny too
But they never meet mom like Vinny's do
I chill with the Clifton Cubs, no Winnie the Pooh
Breaking the rules cause ya'll ain't' break em
Some beats looked good so man I ate em
You wife these broads but I can't save em
The way I hit the pussy you would think I hate em
But I don't hate, just disapprove
Cause they give me brain like an institute
Since 08 I've been the dude
I'm in the building, you just in the room
Uhhh
Haha
I could go on all day on this beat
That's all Imma do
And umm
Free Flacko!
Yuhh!
Adida Gang
Haha
