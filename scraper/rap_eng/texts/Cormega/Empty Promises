[Verse 1]
To make dough, stay low, don't purchase big things
Just purchase big on the first and fifteenth
Too much attention alerts the police
Stay low, don’t do dirt where you sleep
Move right and you better learn your peeps
Who mourn like they move white and work with D's
They will take the weight when they need consignment
But won't take the weight of a secret indictment
They can’t hold secrets, watch who you speak with
Or you'll be doin' time in the pen, not the ink one
Disloyal and they'll switch on you, claimin' they'll die for you
They don't even live for you
They phony and they'll show they ass to shit on you
Only to blow they cash and live off you
If you let ’em, it’s good for you
And bad karma, a lot of people lack honor
They heart is empty as they pant's pockets, uh

[Chorus]
Say what you mean and mean what you say
Empty promises hold no weight
Measure pros and cons
Always show regard to those who show love, talk less, and listen more

[Verse 2]
A man with everything that lacks integrity is morally bankrupt
You can’t buy dignity
The wilder side fools grasp for petty things
Words ain't real if they lack sincerity
Those who never seek never find anything
My relentless pursuit got me seein' better things
You can't compare givin’ hope to sellin' dreams
I'm free, not a puppet on the Devil strings
I got a lot more to see than negative energy
It's counterproductive to where I wanna be
Somewhere on a beach with clear water seem to wash away my sins
I pray toward East
I was at war with myself now I'm way more at peace
Since I came full circle, that's better shape to see
Every day's a day closer to the essence, indeed
In a race against time, you would never take the lead

[Chorus]
Say what you mean and mean what you say
Empty promises hold no weight
Measure pros and cons
Always show regard to those who show love, talk less, and listen more
Say what you mean and mean what you say
Empty promises hold no weight
Measure pros and cons
Always show regard to those who show love, talk less, and listen more
