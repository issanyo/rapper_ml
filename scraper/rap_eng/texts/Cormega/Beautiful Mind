[Verse 1: Cormega]
I'm sick of gossiping bitches and niggas who gossip like bitches
Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin'
Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers
Knowin' they lack the heart of those thats out on the benches
I was out in the trenches-which enables me
To paint such a powerful picture like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics everytime I sit down to write
My *Source* a inspiration, ain't three and a half mics
I must have been an MC in my past life
Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice
People act like I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
Some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me, luck it was not
For years we ran our projects like a marathon, its catastrophic
Our time, death, and pride came out on conquest
Subsequently some are with me others ain't, yet the gutter's within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
Some place judgement against me based on nothing but envy
They pray for My Downfall like the song by Biggie
Born in the city which never sleeps 'til rest in peace
Is carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat
Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny
Except I hope she never see the treachery success could bring
The trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
Never sleep, rest assured Mega is dope in his pure form
The dealer/MC keepin it real is my protocol
Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin on it
The beat is lifeless, 'til I put my verses on it
I reminisce confinement as I read a kite
From my people with secret indictment, freedom and triumph
Contemplating putting sprees on the tires
Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on The Wire
What other lyricist is known for giving people consignment
I'm eager to find my equal in rhyming, I rock Iceberg jeans with the Nikes
An extremist with rhymin deep as Poseidon
Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful enviroment
A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding
Some blind with fury from seeing me shining
Like a phoenix arising from the depths showin' the reaper defiance
