Yeah you know how to move
Right now I’m in the mood to black down the pop off now
So get it in, you know how to move
Said I’m in the mood to black out the pop off now
So get it in
Get it in, get it in get it in
Get it in, get it in get it in, motha f*** what’s up?
Get it in, get it in get it in, get ti in motha ..
Full of ..conquer the week and a..
And play both sides and .. the devil
When life ..reflected and powerful mirrors
Father’s go on and be bothered so mama’s the hero
My intuition is deep from drama I’ve been through
My mind the referee between .. of wisdom
My intentions ... the limit
When I’m writing my lyrics take em high to the highest limits
Let’s get the .. got em me from hard blocks to ..
Like the .. we club from, don’t run out to me
Lyrically I bring it to y’all .. hear that
Like I ain’t got nothing for you I pitch it that
I droll like .. you think you know I go it all like .. to represent

Chorus:
Yeah you know how to move
Right now I’m in the mood to black down the pop off now
So get it in, you know how to move
Said I’m in the mood to black out the pop off now
So get it in
Get it in, get it in get it in
Get it in, get it in get it in, motha f*** what’s up?
Get it in, get it in get it in, get ti in motha ..
.now still holding down call em black now
Shoot your eyes down get on the .. down
I’ll keep..I’m from the ..where we had..in the basement behind the steel door
I’m so tall .. I’ma flow ..whatever you know it’s the fame and the glory
So how I’m ...
And we’re the last motha f**
They call me .. unzippin ..the face like
We do it all day life ..going ..the the death .. out whatever

[Chorus:]
I’ma ..visual ..individual he got 20 .. I’m just lyrical and .. no
..mind Versace ..the eyes ..don’t underscribe me
And all those paintings and ..for these fighting
A .. of control and when ..to ym flows ..
So this ice ...
..is the whole world ..let’s get the flight as my gun
...

[Chorus:]
