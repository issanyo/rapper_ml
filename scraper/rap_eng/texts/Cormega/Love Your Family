[Cormega]
I got a daughter I support her open heartedly
It bothers me how fathers be havin children irresponsibly
How could I not nurture what I conceived
Or deprive her, shes my prophecy
As I stare in her eyes theres no despair, deception
Or awareness, except when givin affection
Shes the water that purifies me
More than likely wearing jordans like me
As she grows ill expose her to all that ive seen
Like the island of saint croy
Where smile and she brings joy
She the cover im the line of what survival is based on
How I teach her to stay strong
And live through wilderness
If I instill in her the will to live
Shell get through it
She my first seed, my genesis
My last bit of innocence
My understanding wisdom brings what knowledge is given
I hope to surround her with prominent figures
So she can grow to be a positive woman and never doubts that I love her

[Hook]
Ain't nothing like family, til they gone then u realize
How much they meant to you, more than a friend'll do
Give em their roses while theyre still alive
I know the world's understanding me
Go ahead show that love stop tryin to be a tough guy
Cuz when they gone youll be saying that you didn't get the chance to say you love em

And you have to live with that for the rest of my life

[Havoc]
To the most 3 influential women in my life
My moms and sister and grandmoms alike
Dont think you dont appreciate the love you give me
And on my birthday the cards you send me
Yall will always be there when others ain't so friendly
To me or to weather my life and never goin empty
No matter how rich I get I know you never envy
No matter how broke I get I know you always help me
No matter what I know that love is wealthy
And all you care if im living or healthy
And only something nice out your mouth that you try to tell me
And if im doing wrong, won't hesitate to tell me
Ayo thats the kinda love that im talking about
So while you here im giving back thats what familys about
If theres anything you need no matter what the price
Try to get it even if it means giving my life
Because....

Chorus

[Cormega]
You gave us life, it ain't your fault the street corrupted us
You raised us right, when them bullies used fuckin with us
You made us fight, gave your heart or soul
Rich or poor, there would always be a pot on the stove
You made sure we had a roof over our head and clothes for school
And discipline soon as we opposed the rules
A hard head made us soft but
When we was comin up you gave us advice on what life would have in store for us

[Havoc]
All you niggas runnin round out there all wild
Playin the streets like its goin outta style
Remember gotta take time out for those who love you
They the only ones could live you like noone else could love you
And if you think im bullshitting let that time pass
Let that ass get broke and see which love last
Blood is thicker than water just remember that
And no matter what the problem know they always got my back
Ya heard
