Cormega the illest
Niggas feel this
My rhymes and raps
Like dmx
I'll kill this
One final request
I'll fullfill the this
Niggas don't know the
Shit i grew up wit
Single parent home
Welfare checks
No phones
Still surviving, multiplying
Trying to make it
In the rap game
The only sane nigga
I never would complain
I put crack aside
Tried the hip hop ride
Stepped my game up
Layed the bitch up
In 99 i try to make my shit blow up
Cause a nigga young as me
Never thuggin
But still known as a g
Can you feel me, no
But you know i'm there
Creepin' through your crib at night
Kill yo mamma
Your brutha, your sister, and your wife
Some call me trife
But its all cause i live a thug life

Hook:
It's a thug life nigga
Say whut???
It's a thug life nigga
Say whut???
It's a thug life nigga
Say whut???
It's a thug life nigga
Say whut???
Crystal(Singin): Thug Life

Sometimes fear takes control of us all
Niggas never realize
The seriousness of it all
Jelously and envy
Takin' over the streets
Make a nigga like me wonder what
We did to deserve these feats
Hungry children in the ghetto
With out enough to eat
Families in housing projects during
The winter without no heat
Speak about it all you want
With reverand jesse jackson
With faracon, cochran
And mr. affirmative action
That's just step one son
Apply it to life
Just like the law about handguns
And remember no nigga out there
Should have to lose his life
Fuck it
I guess it's just thug life

Them muthafuckas on wall street
Don't give a fuck about the ghetto
They would rather suck dick than help you
And ain't afraid to let you know
Then they run for office
Get up and talk shit
Win your vote, get ellected
And don't do shit
I was born and raised
A new york native
Sold drugs, got paid
Until the operation was raided
It makes me sick, day after day
That bum *(clinton) smokes celtzer(weed)
And gets mad paid
The government will never get rid of drugs
They get too much money for it
Congressmen shoot up
And then go to work and legislate
Sounds great
I wish i was a politician
My only mission would
Be to smack crack and pretend like i'm listening
So fuck 'em
We'll handle our problems on our own
They'll probably get mad, try to to take our life
Well nigga
That's just thug life

Yo this is cormega
And i'm here to tell all of you
Livin' on the streets
In housin' projects
And in ghettos
To keep ya head up
Times are bad on the streets
Killin' and shit
But i want each and everyone of you
To keep up hope
Peace out
