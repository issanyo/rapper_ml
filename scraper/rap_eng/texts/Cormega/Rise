[Chorus: Maya Azucena]
I think on these things
And I never hide
From what life bring
Throughout all the lies
Though it feels like no one's by my side
I rise
Despite

[Verse 1: Cormega]
You need food for thought I'm preparing a meal
A savage in pursuit of happiness is never fulfilled
I don't glorify the ghetto I tell you the real
I'd rather write it in a song than in a letter from jail
Like Donald Goines you enjoy my incredible tales
Resonate with those who walk similar paths
Your enemy has more honor than a man in the mask
And familiar voice asking "where is the stash?"
The year Mike Jordan had career high scoring
I put it all together and realize money
Causes attention, resentment a moral conviction
Even God calls him and exploit religion
Rappers tell you lies while glorifying the ghetto
They never speak of mothers' inconsolable cries
So the oppressive aggression
Of those sworn to serve and protect us
Harm us, Sean Bell the martyr was a father

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]
I think on these things
And I never hide
From what life bring
Throughout all the lies
Though it feels like no one's by my side
I rise
Despite

[Verse 2: Cormega]
We learn the hard way so the despair is what we know
Fixed incomes don't repair broken homes
Often [?] fatherless though a man hold his own
And his driven momma gotta take the wheel when he gone
Learn to cherish every meal on the stove
And the clothes she bought you though she couldn't afford to
She did it
So you wouldn't have to conform to
The streets
And she wouldn't have to sit in no courtroom
When minorities compete against law degrees
For freedom accompanied by attorney fees
I'm up late thinking of people in early graves
And how things changed since they've been away
A new dawn approaches, a different day
In my book of life, let's just fill the pages
I'm God-given, hear my praise
In the face of adversity my shield is faith

[Chorus: Maya Azucena]
I think on these things
And I never hide
From what life bring
Throughout all the lies
Though it feels like no one's by my side
I rise
Despite

[Verse 3: Cormega]
There are many I reminisce
In the Lord's hands or system's grip
It's oppressive, a mental whip
Leaving deep scars, slavery still exists
These imperialists see imprisonment as business
When the recession hits, they recidivists
I ain't going back, only as a visitor
To see my people caught up in the pen
Want freedom but don't know what it really is
A natural part of existing, not a privilege
Granted judicially they can shackle you mentally
When your mind's not confined thatâ€™s when you're free

[Outro: Maya Azucena]
Yeah yeah
I rise, I rise, I rise
I rise, I rise
Despite
I rise 'til I get home
