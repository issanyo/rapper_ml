[Verse]
It was '85, Queensbridge was crazy live
Smitty was an icon, his son had and MB5
Shan was the man on the rap tip, Marley on the beats
Big Wag on the crack tip, shit was sweet
Trent was a fly nigga, John Boi a live nigga
Trag' hung with Oogie, you my heart 'til I die nigga
Herb was a troublemaker, RK a money-maker
Can't forget Wee-Wop, he was the illest ball player
'86 was when the Bridge stuck together
The era of crack vials and Dapper Dan leathers
Karenga was a funny nigga, Fat Boy a hungry nigga
Wells from the 40 busters was a get money nigga
When Tyrone died, we cried with Thomas
Smash had the accident that shocked the projects
Then "The Bridge" dropped, Kris got on the bandwagon
And did Shan, but it was good for hip-hop
And '87, Hot Day mixtapes was bangin'
Anita Baker sang while we were slangin', doin' our thing
Hangin' on corners with Roach, that was enormous
Big Butter was reppin', The Dime had the tournaments
Rodney was a flashy nigga
Prince Wally had heat, Mark Allen used to physically smash niggas
Can't forget Yammy with the skill and hand speed
That also is the year we first seen blue van D's
Fun and World was gettin' it big time
And nigga World was the first nigga I seen with a 5
'88 was ill, John Hov got killed
In the summertime niggas parked their rides on the hill
Drawz was a fighter, Spunk was a cash getter
Nut was mad skinny but not scared to blast niggas
Don't even ask about a Queensbridge jam, kid
The music was loud and secluded the blastin'
Im from 40-15 like Horse and Douler
Alley Joe Mar and Troy the future
Jungle to Watson, fishin' at Austin's
Puerto Rican Juan on the fifth floor snortin'
Can't forget Kool Chip, Hays and Bo
Spud Black, Jay E, Flam Mayo
Wallet, Slate, Hi-C, Starby
Grand Wiz, Crazy Barry, and his brother Robby
A year later we was duckin' from Bobby
On the ave, it was Crazy, Smalls, Black, and Party
Kenya, Lisa, Inga, Richie, Opps, and Howie
Suitor and Barkim, and Foul One, the hand-to-hand king
