Yo, pushin' a red Lex, mini screens in my headsets
So much beef, police suprised I ain't dead yet
I keep mad heat, under my passenger seat, to massacre beef
It's so real, if I don't see you, I'm snatchin' ya peeps
It's on, nigga, whoever get hit first, is gonna kiss dirt
My soldiers, cold blooded, vultures
Cold flooded, on streets, we control hundreds
I drink coladas, but some of my niggas roll blunted
Ya man froze when I drove up, I symbolize death
Like a cobra attack, your life fear is over
Black you fucked up, you never should of stuck-up
My spot, cock suckers scared to die, tough luck
Run, prepare to meet ya maker, no longer is you grimey
Motherfucker, seein' paper
I burn your insides like Henny nigga, need a chaser?
Pray to gods, the way ya odds, cuz only he could save ya
Motherfuckers, it's..

The Montana shit, the money and the power shit
Real recognize real, dough, I need a lot of it
My name, you honor it, niggas analyzin'
Need to take a look inside the Montana diary

[Cormega]
Yo, I walk among men that wanna be me, love that wanna see me
Mega Montana, drama, I love, bring it
Never sleepin', I close my eyes and see my enemies
With nines reachin', so I awaken
Criminal thoughts, become premeditation
Yo, fuck explanations, son, I need the safe combinations
Surrounded by snipers in a major operation
Authorities acknowledge me, kingpin, replacin' weak men
Layin', sneakin', on the strength of information leakin'
My destination reachin' the top, and puttin' heat in a cop
Who wanna care if my heart beat was runnin' fast
Yo, son, it only takes a second for my gun to blast
Give me the world and everything in it
My enemies meet an uzi with a pearl finish
I live it, my life a pure corruption, remember these last words
I ain't the one to fuck with, aiyo, I live..

[Cormega]
You fuck with me, you fuckin' with the best
The crime emperor, niggas'll die because my mind sinister
I pack an automatic, of course, to uphold my status
Cuz money bring power, and power bring madness
And it, got a nigga mind, into bigger crime
I epitomize, mad dough, and no prison time
The money make a nigga sour like lemon-lime
I'm gettin' mine, you gettin' yours, kid, with a nine
It's Mega Montana, introducing
Bigger ways to get paid, rhyme distribution
And if there's a problem, I'mma find a solution
My face in the mirror, shows the eyes of the ruthless
Sky's the limit, rides are tinted
My life's so trife, I don't advise y'all, niggas to try to live it
My innervision of better living inspired me
To write the saga called the Montana Diary
Bring it back, son
