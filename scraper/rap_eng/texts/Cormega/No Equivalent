[Verse 1: Tragedy Khadafi]

Predicate felon style since a juvenile catching cases
Runnin' concurrent burnin' weed and gettin' blunted
Word to my mama never ran from drama I just confront it
See the streets I breath and inhale it
Manifested through these mics revealing soon as i spit you feel it
Guns I conceal in a CL6, remove the ceiling
No jewels I'm on some light shit
Frank Mueller watch on my wrist
My reputation exceeds your ears bleed soon as I spit digest this
Convicts, study my lines like a lower library
Lose they appeal in jail it's real when lives get buried
Niggas bust nines but take the older clip in
Tattoos over my wounds I'm never slippin'
My lynchmen bustin' guns is like an addiction
Hustlers scramblin' somewhat of a tradition
The truth, live niggas gather round my testimony listen

[Bridge]
What do you see when you look at us, convicts
You know what we see when we look at you
We see ourselves
But when you look at us
You never see yourselves

[Verse 2: Cormega]

There's no equivalent lyrically
Sickest jewellery I wear
Rhymes i spit em beautifully I swear
40 side is where I learned to hustle dimes and bust a nine
At any man who fuck with my residential area
Left realizing that 'Mega is superior
I could be smooth or bring it like a pit terrier
Yo, there's no equivalent to me, fake niggas envy
The fact a nigga flow infinitely
Son it's on 'till my clip is empty
To me drama is high caliber gats and low tolerance
You niggas got no stamina, you can't fastbreak
Against the top rated defense that stopped ya season
From advancing to the regional finals
I defeated you, my millimeter blew the game open
I stay strokin threes and four fours with ease
The commentators saw the way I dominate the floor
I love this game
