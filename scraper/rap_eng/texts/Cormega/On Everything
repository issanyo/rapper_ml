[Verse 1]
Uh, I try to show love yet hate
It's what’s given in return, snakes
Don't stand for nothin' they ain’t
Built the same, I try to relate
Then I remember the accursed serpent who slithers has wicked ways in every page of scripture
When mentioned, pay attention to whispers and loud talkers
Are in no position to listen, I try to warn 'em
My darkest thoughts conform to my enlightened conscience
Align my chakra with the Higher Power I acknowledge
And pray they never find the shotta
The lies ain't addin' up so they divide and conquer
To stop as I aspire to design intricate lines listeners vibe to
Follow your dream, acknowledge self-esteem, it's inside you
Gotta want it more than anyone that would deny you

[Chorus]
I give it how I live it on everything I try
I give it how I live it on everything I try
I give it how I live it on everything I try

[Verse 2]
I try to see the good in people
If I see nothin', my view's obstructed or you're evil
I’m more cerebral, less impulsive, thoughts are deeper
The abyss of contemplation, lost thinkers
Make wiser decisions, influence schemers
Are so intrigued by greed, they ignored freedom
Justice is blind, the judge oversees you
Through presumptuous eyes before he hangs you
I relinquish impatient ways for calm reason
Meanin’ I stay cool even on warm beaches
Good vibes only even if love changes
Keep your dignity, bad energy supports anger
Causes loss, anguish, and court cases
Short tempers are often before long faces
Learn rules to the game before playin'
Know your hitters and pitchers, cover all bases

[Chorus]
I give it how I live it on everything I try
I give it how I live it on everything I try
