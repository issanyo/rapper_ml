[Verse]
No army formed against me shall prosper
Especially not yours, I stand up, you got weak posture
Ineffectively plannin' my demise, you're intellectually challenged
Not understandin' wisdom brings balance
Between sophistication and savage, I'm a different cloth (Cloth)
No similar fabric exists in rappers
Often lie, I speak my truth, a clear advantage
I wear honor like a rare medallion
On my chest lays the burden of proof
My reputation earned, not given, no words could dispute
A wise man would rebuke a servant with juice
Cup overflows for the thirstiest fool (Fool)
Yearns to consume what he's never tasted
Success is taken bitter with sweet and elevatin'
No expectation, no disappointment
A thorough thinker has great respect for preparation, uh
