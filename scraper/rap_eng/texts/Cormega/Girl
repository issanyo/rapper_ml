[Verse: Cormega]

She's latin
Highly attractive
Leave you numb with one touch
You stuck she leave you strung
I been with her but no longer deal with her
Can't take her home to momma but my father was feeling her
Sensuous touch and such
Men have killed for her
Prisoners upstate who face many years for her are still in love
Reminiscing she was fine and pure
She burned Richard Pryor when he piped her raw
She got good qualities despite her flaws
She will be with you when you rise or fall
Your nose wide open the final straw should've been when she stole Len Bias heart
Her kiss can eclipse a shining star
Time apart make you desire her more
Sugar Ray couldn't even fight her off
As soon as that blow hit him his title was lost
She been abused by dudes who minds ain't strong
Stepped on
Cut by niggas tryna get on
She resilient, real good at hiding her scars
A Chameleon who blends in as life goes on
Men with millions fly her all over the world she stimulating
Women hate when she in their man faces
Situations tend to get crazy when you fiend for her
Scheme for her
Willing to bleed for her
I seen brothers loose everything for her
In some ways it became karma
I'm at the point in my life where I don't need drama
I just wanna chill
Where she go the heat follow
Niggas in the street want her but she be frontin' they understand that to bag that you need money
I was a young nigga hustling with jewelery on that she bought me
Rappers lie but the truth is Corey
Knew the rules and accepted them I respected her
So I knew mixing business with pleasure was a detriment to everything I represent
We needed our own space so she got her own place and gave me a key don't hate
Or think you could take her from me
It was your money she was bringing to me
I was content she convinced me to take her OT
Her persuasion over me replaced my own dreams could'nt be fufilled
She was saying don't sleep
She had me on lock 'til the day I broke free of her schemes
I was flipping for things I don't need
Plus she fucked a lot of people close to me
??
While she with the next man getting crushed frequently
There was a time where she was everything it seems but the end don't justify the means to me
