[Cormega]
Yo son, we need the silence
Yo shit is real I can't escape the violence
In my sleep, I see jail cells in Gator Island
My greatest challenge, to analyze, like I'm weighing ounces
Lounging in a rover, on a Jamaican island
I kick the potent grammar, flow like, coke you bag up
I told my son in mart nine to blow your man up
My hand to hand soldiers, rep ill
If my words don't affect you, then death will
Mega Montana, for real, say hello to the bad guys
This Busta Rhymes, Mega shit is madd fly, and I
Keep my heater on standby
The nine millimeter shine, kill or be killed
You fuck me you die, you fuck me you die, you fuck me you'll die
I don't trust a nine, but a I love my nigga Busta Rhymes

[Busta Rhymes]

Busta Rhymes will make all you niggas fall on the floor
Catch a heat stroke, Busta Rhymes is still provoke
Niggas will choke off my black smoke, what the fuck
Niggas don't really want the noise, its Busta Rhymes
I make noise, for all the little girls and boys
To enjoy when I speak
It's Busta Rhymes, and I get down every single day of the week
Motherfuckers talk that bullshit, shit still sound weak
What the fuck you dealing wit?
Niggas is bustin' nuts all over your families
Its Busta Rhymes, and I come through, and I defy gravities
Niggas can not see the technology

Busta Rhymes coming through for real, Cormega..

[Cormega]
Yeah, Yeah, It's like that and you don't stop
My nigga Busta Rhymes kicking from the bottom to the top
In the studio live, me and my niggas lied
My and my nigga Busta rep'n since 9-5
Cause 95, that's the year a nigga like me arrived
On the streets I was locked down, doing my time
I see my nigga Busta in the studio, he like yo
"Your shit is peace God", I'm like "peace, I like you too bro"
Ever since then, we've been cool like Hennessey, and Remi
And rhyme is like extremity
I'm in the studio, kicking the rhyme again, I'm divine again
With my black notebook, and ill fucking Heineken
My nigga motherfucker Busta, the Rhyme
Yo, shit is real God
Peace, love, divine (Word is born)

[Busta Rhymes]
It was a nice little moment
We just coming through breezing, like sea breeze on niggas
No doubt, we throw niggas on grills and barbeque there ass
Real hot for the 9-7, Cormega back on the streets, nigga
What the fuck is the deal with all y'all
Niggas getting a little sneak previews on how the climate might change
Fuck is the problem? Stay focused before you miss out on the God
Violator family like, y'all niggas get familiar with it
Aiight, chill
