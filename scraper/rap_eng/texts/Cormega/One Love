Nas: What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?

Yea I'm about to write this letter, lay it down you know?

[Verse 1]
Dear Nas, what up son it's Mega
I got your letter, me and my cousin Oogie here together
Aiyyo your man Duke came through
You should know the situation cause we dealing with the same crew
And you can tell that crab shorty I'mma hurt her
For fucking with them niggas from that crew she know we want to murder
A yo that shit about Jerome's niece is foul
She was bringing niggas mad lye when we was locked down
Word around town the 4 pounds of Glocks
On the dime block
Labels are marked now they have they full time lock
Son fuck the stupidness
Shorty be trooping it
Next time you see her hit her off with some loot and shit
Don't forget the kicks I already got flicks
Big Ice hit the bricks from c-76
Homocide D's are ready to blitz Trevor and Stick
String with the green his razor blade blew six
Ayo

[Hook]
One love, one life, one mind dreaming
Son one day I'm leaving
One thug showing you love for one reason
For all my niggas thats locked down and bleeding (2x)

[Verse 2]
Anyway I heard Black Jay was getting paper
Tell my nigga Nut his man Bass is here from Jamaica
I was holding down the fort at four Atherton
You couldn't touch a jack unless you had gats or box cutters
I seen an ox cutter, so many features
Niggas sneaking up and blowing motherfuckers for their sneakers
I seen this kid cut police up, for real money creeped up
Slid the ills out and blew the beast up
Yo handcuffs can make a man tough and suffer
My rhymes keep your mind stimulated like a lye puffer
Yo this life is type bugged
I'm surrounded by dope fiends and thugs
But I'm a still maintain my brain frames so...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo the other day I got it on in my dorm
I had Fila slippers on then I transformed
My man dawg from Nostrand in the back posted
Money started looking when he seen dawg approaching
I said, yo black we could take it to the back
But thats about the time the razorblade made contact
I got relaxed, in fact he collapsed and bitched up
And got ripped up and stitched up for trying to tough
I picked up my ill - son said chill
Yo parlay about the way the kid's face spilled
Stashed my ox in case they throw my ass in a box
I could splat the first idi-ot looking for props
The phone time locked, my chrome ox makes domes hot
If I can't live then I'mma blow up your whole spot
Seen shorty on her visit and gave her a hug
When she cried I recognized we symbolized one love..
