I'm filled with optimism as I write a composition
That might ease the hunger pains that'll keep me out of prison
Some claim they use to hustle in they verses
I'm cursed with a past addiction, of getting paid off crack addictions
Glad I'm living, shit changed I'm looking at flicks of fam who's missing
Some angels, some in prison
Sending letters to they girl, who endeavor in the world
And like it or not, seeks pleasures of the world
I'm fighting with my conscience, like rival gangs in Compton
Cuz I don't like a person, should I refrain or pop him?
I write the trifest verses, in the hood I'm like a prophet trying to fight the serpent
And live a thug life, I'm determined
To get right like Tony but I don't sniff white
I hit mics straight up, no cut, my flow just
Improving, hip-hop is in a state of disillusion
And I'm a infiltrate the weak
Like my rhyme invigorates the beat, like my nine intimidates the street
My mind is deeper than wounds inflicted when I blaze my heat
It was predicted I would come from the slums
And show these fake niggas how it's done, uh..

For years niggas glorified the ill criminal life, Personified
I'm just trying to do me, stay alive
Get money, keep my family tight
Legal Hustle till I die..

I remember rocking the same jeans for the whole weak
Staring at my mother, watching her drink her misery
Nothing for me to do, God'll see us through
In the ghetto everybody's not me or you
I'm strong minded, the rest is blinded
Even through the darkest nights I shine like a diamond
Baby's crying, dogs barking, in the background you can hear Marvin
Singing the blues, some fights you win or you lose
To tell you the truth, I ain't into losing
This is a ghetto reunion, all my niggas is here
I swear, I wish my grandpops was here
To see his baby girl on top
In Heaven, I know you watching, the shit don't stop
Biggie and Pac, remember, forever
We all play hard together, let's get money together..
