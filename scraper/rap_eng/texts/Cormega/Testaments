Background: "For the rest of my life"
Intro:
Yo a man don't got nothing to die for ain't worth living
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yo I do this shit for niggas in jail cells, niggas on
The corners hustlin'. YouknowhatI'msayin? I do this shit from the heart
Man

Verse 1:
Yo I write rhymes for Beemers, Rovers overachievers
O.G.s and young thugs wanna hold heaters
One love real niggas not gettin' out to make a deal nigga
I leave a nigga head numb like Bill Snivers
Figure me out my duns pillin' Infinities out
I'm on some real shit blowin' my enemies out
If there's a thrown touchin' it I don't condone
Pac and Biggie rule forever don't get it confused, never
My testamony will be death to a phoney MC
You wanna impress me show me a key
Or I suggest we manifest this a drug deal test
Put your coke in the water solidify the rest yeah
Never question this poetry I'm manifestin' this
Graffitti scriptured my mind paints an easy picture
Analyse every line my scene will vandalise
Mega Montana handle mine yo at night I use to fantasize
Triple beam scheme banana five yo my pen keep the plan alive
I went from misdate to big H my niggas know I keep the shit straight
Cormega talking:
Yeah ya know testaments it's like uncuut raw dope you know? Bag this up
Ship this to ever hood knowhatI'msayin' son? You pump this on your block
This is where I stand for my clinetel you know? Then after that we have 'em
Make distribution of this, word

Verse 2:
Yo I need stacks of green either rap or cracks to fiends
It's mad trife I seen enditments trap my team
Yo deep thoughts supreme courts decievin' me
Trapped in the belly like the beast was conceiving me
Thug status yo son I'm above average
When it's time for you to die does love matter?
You ain't sharing nothing payin' that and on bail weighing nothing on scale
Nigga you stay frontin' me I got plans like niggas who chop grams
See when I eat my niggas eat
See you wouldn't understand I'm too real for you
What you dream I live and breath which means
Don't make me have to kill you play the game
See real niggas stay the same
Y'all niggas scarred to play our change
Cause y'all forgot the streets where ya came
Shit is real yeah my words sound forbidden still
I write lines for niggas still I wipe dimes who livin' ill
I represent excellence my minds and I my third eye a extra clip yet to spit
So never questioned it poetry I'm manifestin' it
Graffitti filled testament
Cormega talking:

Green on my side. (ha ha) Let's get it, get it together. Nawmean? That's my
Testament. That's what I stand for. Either with me or against me. I'm out
