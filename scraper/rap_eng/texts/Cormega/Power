(Verse: O.C.)
Yo, behind the scene Rasheen calling shots
We debate in front of have-nots, lost souls from back blocks
Everybody in they hood feeling they all can rap
Thinking it’s a way out the Trap
School is lame, feel it, they have nothing to gain
All they know is guns and cocaine
I can’t recall the moment, the time the suits despised rap
Saying it was noise and non-sense
Once it became a voice for the people
They saw dollar signs, artists got signed
Low level opinionated A&R's
So off is they had no clue what was going on
Fast forward, cash out the start of minus
Skewer days, I really can’t call it
Evil seeds in place, all I’m seeing is a wasteland
Built off drugs, money and self-hate

(Hook x2)
I’ll tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin get they ones, I’m tryin get them M's
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live

(Verse: Cormega)
I might front but I won’t go backward
I’m every slave’s dream, I own my masters
Unlike most rappers, even if I don’t go platinum
I live like I did, that’s all that matters
They said I couldn't do it, I did it
Independent with lyrics that don’t produce for listeners
Forward music no excuses
Only a chosen few show and prove it to be true to cultures influence resulted in moguls’ influence
Revolution’s the only solution
Get back to basics and stop chasing illusions, of vultures looming
Causing confusion, regain the focus you losing
The goal’s improving, the future of our culture ensured
If you're a vocally gifted artists supposed to be winning
But those who be spinning, dick ride are more than the women
Causin division by ignoring the feelings of fans who know what is missing
Hip-hop in its purest existence

(Hook x2)

(Verse: Ill Bill)
Another record label snitch but fuck it
You know, one love kid, no I’m not doing it big
Try to throw me under the bus and ruin the kid
And came back with full fronts and exclusive kicks
Stays up ahead, always adapt; evolve; survive
Sharpen your knives, in other words sharpen your mind
That’s your most valuable tool
Always stay alerted, wide open, alerted all times, actual truth
Make opportunities happen
Once that your a full time student of rapping, you’re responsible for your actions
No complaints, you ain’t got no time for that
‘Cause time’s money and you're in the red 9 to black
Get it where you fitting in there's more power in packs
Pop em before they pop us in the showering gats
From corporate pack lies to crack spots
I got the chop chops way before you popped out your mom’s box

(Hook x2)
