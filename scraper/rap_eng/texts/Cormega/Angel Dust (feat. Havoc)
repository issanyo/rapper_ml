(Cormega)
Yo, laid back like a fat buddha holding my pearl handle luger
In a landcruiser rims shine like daytime in Bermuda
I rap tight smoother than niggas who be fronting like parakeet movers
I had to be financially set new lex
In front of my duplex my shine dripping wet
New nine's in case your group flex
My brown eyes leaving your boot stretched
So bad you had to get a new rep vest
Cause i collect stats, my advice is to accept that
Step back blast dont even wet that, yo
It's mandatory, I'm self explanatory
Don't front on me shorty
Your man's working for me

(Havoc Chorus)
Ayo we move ki's
Angel dust son you get touched
Dress up get rushed
Stepping up or press luck
Cormega coming through, duck
Move slowly get bucked
Criminal minds get stitched up
Down to buy your watch or bitch up

(Cormega)
Ayo this crime addict mind
My rhyme status shines
Like a nine 'matic
Yo im scarface for real I wanna die blasting f**k stashing
My next 50 g's I'm buying me a five wagon
Thugged out leather interior, mega superior
My art of war deaded your area
My mugshot praised in jail cells and drug spots
My razor touched faces and cut rocks
Corrupt cop cases had me on semi vacation
In state greens laid down weight schemes
With niggas that get payed and take cream
Drug supplier, thugs admire
Ghetto dun dun gun fire deep mind none higher
Your drama equalizer
I speak the murder Kiser Sose, no survivors

(Chorus 2x)
(Cormega)
Teach on threats
Concepts I didn't speak on yet
Courts feared mentally severe to the ear
Thug general, white lines for criminal minds to listen to
Chemical rhymes sparkle like a '62
Invinsible foulness my style is trife like Rikers Isle get
Queen Bridge projects is lounging on a cocaine mountain
Ayo Hav let the four pound spit, what!

(Chorus 2x)
