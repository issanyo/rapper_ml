[Production by Jay Garfield]

It's time to separate the rookies from vets
Pussies from threats, truth and lies
Supplies from dealers and death
I'm feeling this, I'm young and ruthless
Status unmatched undisputed, some assuming
My destiny to rep these streets
I'm built for this
The will is too strong
Feelings numb from dealing too long
It's real count ya friends when you on
My pen is visual I'm real, men are miserable
I feel the tension growing
You hold a grudge, I'm 45 with infra holding, no love
Hungry like my ribs are showing, as if you didn't notice
I spit the potent, uncut raw my mind is pure ferocious
Like a shark I tear you open cuz you blood in my ocean
My pen it ghost people, like dope needles
When I rhyme there's no equal
The flow will freeze you, like Medusa stare I'm so lethal
Obvious I'm a vill, with odds against me
Like Rasheed Wallace its hard to stick me
I'm built for this
In the streets, I'm powerful if shit gets dirty
30-30 clips will shower, you exist cause I allow you to live
I conquered you, I kinda knew you was weak
I can see how cowards do
I write epic facing a scholar, question my life expectannce
My essence is getting money, my aura like Lexus
On the mic I'm relentless, pursuit of perfection
Ya new connect for pure, uncut raw - what
I caught a rush when ever my palms clutch a gun, pen or a ki
Or a dime satisfy my every need
I write rhymes with killer instinct, yet to find a nigga iller then me
Some smile at my face, yet they still against me
I detect the fake, never sleep or deny death for waste
Or conversate in the presence of snakes
When and where and time I'm measuring weight
You destined to think or where does he get this paper, son we nearly extinct
I realized that when burying spank, the real will perish ya life
Conceal evidence my rhyme skill is excellent
M - for the man
E - executioner
G - get money
A - all my niggas movin' up
I'm BUILT FOR THIS
For real its in me, like R. K I'll make you feel the big heat
The illest is me, the drug dealer MC, semi-auto I conceal on these streets
To uphold the kiss of death and try to deal ki's and snort blow
You can't replace me
I live the rhyme I visualize, you ain't real I see it in ya eyes
I spit nines, weight coke on scales that's digitized
The realness I live and die, the streets I epitomize the trife life
I rock jewels with ice, verbally I bruise mics
Mega live it I'm ghetto, my shit is chromed out
Give me a pen and watch a nigga zone out
I can't believe the shit I spit is from my own mouth
