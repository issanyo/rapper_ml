Younawmsayin' son?
Shit is real
Yo, I'm from a place where niggas get it on
And bullshitters get shitted on
And dead niggas keep living on
And memories once the henny's pourin'
I see the sadness of so many mourned
Yet the beauty of so many born
And the only man I trust is god
Cause the devil come in many forms
On the day I rest eternally
I'll be a thug for eternity
The longer word is fire burning me
But you younger thugs could learn from me
Love is love..
