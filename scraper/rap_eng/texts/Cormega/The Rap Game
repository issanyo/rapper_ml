[Rapper Big Pooh - Intro]
Yeah...
Little Brother, uh..
Khyrsis on the boards with the HEAT!
Ah! ' Mega..
Yo..

They wanna know who it is, it's I who doin it
Rapper bring it iller than most, no brag, no boast - I tell it like it is
Been across the globe, couple records sold
Couple hoes lost control, I ain't tryna have kids
Tryna have biz - import, export
UPS-out sort, minority on 'scort
Loyal on the team, got my people's L back
My brother Ronnie back, tryna keep him out of court!
Keep him out of sorts with the same drug hustle
Eight years later, we facin a new struggle
Bet it all, black, tryna see my money double
Spun it to the red, now I know we all in trouble
Rap Game/Crack Game both startin to bubble
Both startin to hustle, stack our chips
I thought I went straight when we first started out
But now I'm lookin back, neither one is legit, sheeit!

[Phonte]
Yeah...uh..
Niggas sayin Phonte's the embodiment
Of hip-hop, so when my shit drop
Just cop any verse and watch him body it
Leave your team stonefaced like monuments
Cross-country - sheeit! I'm cross-continents
Take a trip where we get that dough
Niggas lookin at me like, "Is that so?"
But we flip that dough and dip like condiments
Cheap nigga, but I still stay confident
Hell, I'm only payin taxes and compliments
While all of y'all watch me, there's been a murder
Y'all should call for the autopsy - or
Call the law, somebody should stop me
Killin each track is the shit I'm on
QB to NC is how we get it on
LB and 'Mega real rap Renaissance - check it out

[Cormega]
My lyrical skills is superior to many arguably
Mental energy generate artistry
And hip-hop is not deceased, it's dealing with Christ, ironically
Yet His calm'll manifest it like a prophesy
The art was disregarded for economy
They played us, it ain't like the labels let the artist eat
They bait us with dreams of dreams escapin poverty
VMA'ed ya, yet they pay us like minorites
Need to raise up like a Quantum Leap
Stay up, ain't no time to sleep
Save and buy some property, then cop you a V
Acknowledge these jewels are conflict-free
I style on you when I rhyme and that was just me
The last MC on the track with LB (sheeit!)
My rhymes are doper than a crackhead's dream
I drew more text than Artest's sheet
Which means even the haters must respect my game
