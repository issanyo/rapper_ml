[Cormega]
Straight Outta Queensbridge a crazy motherf**ker named Cormega
In a Viper chromed out beyond measure
I got your girl and, wit' a Sterlin'
Automatic that'll have your ass twerlin'
Niggas know if they ever f**k wit' me
The police gonna have to come get me
Off your ass, I don't really give a f**k
Bitch motherf**ker, I should really hit you up
Niggas wanna mumble, when I come through
Iceberg jeans and ice comin' out the sleeves
Showin' off on a motherf**ker like that
Cause I'ma hustler slash rapper
Life's a bitch, my gun smoke'll make ya catch cancer
Nigga I rep' the street till I rest in piece
If you wanna bring your vest and heat
My projects'll be the last place you ever see
So when you in my neighborood, you better duck
Cormega is crazy as f**k
When it's on, your ass better mean it
Cause when I come back boy, I'm comin' Straight Outta Queensbridge
