[Verse 1]
My rise inevitable
I rhyme incredible
I try to ascend to the highest level when I'm in the booth
I execute like an armed sniper
Nicer than me now cipher
I'm an articulate lyricist
I remind you of the era
When Strickland was with the knicks
Fort greene was Preme's and streets was serious
I spit, sick as diesel in your vain
Which means you get a rush and fiend for me to mc again
As I look back how I cooked crack and what we became
From greed, no mystique in this hood we proclaim
Where life and death are common as right and left
And dealin rock is like boxing you can win with the right connect
Yet if ya stance ain't strong you lose rounds
Be evasive body shots will put you down
I spared with patience now I spill dom on the pavement
For those who ain't here, my honor is sacred
I came from sleepin on cots in cages
To sleepin on beaches on tropic vacations
My poetrys deep over melodic arrangements
Ayatollah hooked the beat up and I just laced it

[Hook]
*Record Scratches*
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out x2

[Verse 2]
Enter my realm they callin me a savior, of hip-hop
Same time niggas who get knocked and callin me for paper
The cycle is never ending like my pen against paper
In my premises I'm infinite no lyricist is greater
Straight up, like coke off the stove get ya weight up
My mental strainer separates pure from infiltrator
And men who betray us when in danger they scared to face consequences
They want live niggas respect but have the heart of women
The art is missin' like an ancient civilization it's hard to listen
Rap and hip-hop are different
I'm a student of tradition
A sneaker head who used to pee the bed
Now I'm shitting in the beamer lift my heater if my seed ain't fed
I seen the streets make a killer outta tj
My pj's is said to breed base heads
Some people feel relieved when the seen spank dead
They even grieve fakes tears knowin it's he they fear
I flow with ease over the beat this is me right here
No need to be king, to the street I'm here, apparent
A maverick in the art of rappin
I hold no grudge but palm a gat for those plottin those as if I'mma have it
It's not gon happen I'll pop off like a block war and turn a fiend to hardcore addict

[Hook]
