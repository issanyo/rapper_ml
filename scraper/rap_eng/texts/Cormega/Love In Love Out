[Production by J-Love]

[Verse 1]
When I came home from jail we was brothers
Your beef was my beef
Remember that time with Butta on your video set
When he was talking bout shooting
If you don't pay him, then I got into it
Son you gave me a hundred dollars when I came home
I didn't complain I wasn't in it to gain
You my nigga when you hot and when the temperature changed
Now we enemies, 'til we enter the grave
When I got signed to Def Jam I offered you ten grand
You said you didn't want it, then you started acting funny
It started with the cover of YSB
A picture of The Firm, everyone except me
Then my voice disappeared off La Familia
That's when it was clear to me there wasn't no real love
I was out The Firm, unless I signed a production deal
Which I didn't do cause son, that wasn't real
I was never jealous of you in fact I was proud of you
I smiled when I heard you on "Live at the Barbeque"
I respect you as an artist though I'm no longer fond of you
I gave you love from the heart unlike the people surrounding you

[Chorus]
Love in, Love out
Nowadays is no honor, only drama
Your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow
Never show weakness, tell 'em no secrets
What's deep is, I had love for you
But due to situations, I can't fuck with you
Trust is a luxury I can't afford
Betrayal's something that I can't ignore

[Verse 2]
My love is real, some earn it, some are unworthy
Some, walk in the presence of men with thoughts to hurt me
And wonder why I throw shade and stay to myself
Cause I'm me, plus I'm not betraying myself
I'm free from the burden of extending my hand
To my man's that don't deserve it, I only trust fam
When I was locked up, you was doing you excluded me
You should be happy now that I'm doing me
Niggas, acting like I won't give if I have it
I got a question: Who came to Spank wake empty handed?
You smile in my face yet your eyes reveal the hate
Next time you talk about me, mention I ain't fake
I'm living my dream, live yours, I gave sweat and tears
You didn't even buy my CD, you say you my man? (uh)
You so jealous your emotions make you careless
I hope when you hear this it makes you think before you staring
At your last I hear you scheming
I'm reading you your last right
Get your mind off primitive thoughts and get your cats right
I'm not limited, without rap I'd still be getting it
Yours truly, the dealer / lyricist

[Chorus]
