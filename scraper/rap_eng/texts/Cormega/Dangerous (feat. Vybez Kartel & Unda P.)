(Ladies insist that we start well)
Dangerouuuuuuuussssssssssss!!!!!!! (Real badman worldwide)

[Verse 1: Cormega]
Like City Of God adversity is Medusa's curse I been hard when facin admeasurable odds
I clearly evolve like Bibby when Webber was Gone
The jewels keep me cool when the weather is warm
The Coups be as hot as the strip that we on
Though I'm dealin no more I'm here with cess me import
You can get wet for real this ain't a mirage
These are treacherous waters with dangerous sharks
When my pacers were gone, I came from the heart
The realness gave me my start I'm here playin my part
Like an illustrious picture, your face in my palm
When the game is on the line I'm amazingly calm
Whether I'm in the streets or a Jamaican resort
I'm a stay doin me that's the way I was taught
Destined for greatness success breeds hatred
I can't see in the hearts of man I just see paper

[Chorus:]
Dangerouuuuuuuussssssssssss!!!!!!!
I am dangerous, yay!!! I am dangerous, yay!!!

[Verse 2: Vybz Kartel]
Hey! We dangerous like a Taliban
With knives, hostages and two jumbo jets
More dangerous than unprotected sex
AK's ninja teck's, fi day to day flex
Swords and machete, too petty, Spears, fi Britney
Bows and arrows don't fit mi
HK dangerous like Bobby Brown to Whitney
Murder from di elderly to pickney
America's Most Wanted, starrin Kartel and Cormega
We on CNN not Capone-N-Noreaga
Mi a gunna, nuh fist to fist trada
Kill Will Smith just to kiss Jada, Pinkett
Slash yuh throat catch yuh blood, drink it
Yuh crew big like Titanic mi sink it
Yuh walk, like hip hop music from Limp Bizkit
We born killas natural is di mystic
We spray bullet inna yuh face like make up and lip stick

[Chorus:]
Dangerouuuuuuuussssssssssss!!!!!!!
I am dangerous, yay!!! I am dangerous, yay!!!

[Verse 3: Unda P]
Alright catch this!

Mi gunshot bun it, Cormega, bum rush it

Di ting di ghetto yute man have dem waan tek it
Nuh pampa nah pet, now get ready to set it widout warnin

[Chorus:]
Dangerouuuuuuuussssssssssss!!!!!!!
