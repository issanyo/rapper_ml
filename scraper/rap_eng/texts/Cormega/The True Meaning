(Girls singing chorus X2)

Out there, (out there, out there)
In the street you know, (in the street you know)
I'm strugglin', (strugglin')
Trying to survive...

(Verse 1)
People feeling my pain, a mental bond shared
Been through so many struggles only to persevere
Remember when we hustled, knowing the 1st was near
That's when that money doubled, then we purchased gear
Now was it worth my trouble, it was my first career
The only life I knew, there's no regrets or fears
Yo son I reminisce this ghetto life and shed a tear
For my niggas who walkin' up heaven stairs
I met men in penitentiaries
Who been down so long they barely missed the street
If you real hold your own son, lay your law
My inner visions are revealed so I say no more
My man said it ain't a game so I play no more
Whether you rap or bust gats, lay your law
Fuck that, If you touch crack save up, your story
Can be reduced to jail suits and war stories
It's deep the way my pens speaks words my mouth envies
I'm hoping holy water could cleanse me
D's wanted to apprehend me
If I affected your life in any way trife
When I was doing crime forgive me

(Chorus X2)

(Verse 2)
Exquisitely I write
Tales of hand to hand sales which cause three to life
When all else fails some people seek Jesus Christ
Some relax to the seductive mystique of the pipe
And be back inside the same cell they left
It's sort of like hell or death
Except we still here breathin' in the flesh receiving respect
Yet, being stressed cause we threats to society
Solutions are rare, problems are in varieties
I try to be, thinking of ways to get paid
My realness engraved from the cradle to the grave
Mega, thug forever
My departure from drugs could never
Sever what I learned, or respect I earned
Yo my status alone surpasses your own
Known for blastin' my chrome
And having my own
Niggas fraudulent, I wish there was a law against
The sort of shit these rappers talk and never even thought exist
When I was young I used to, hustle for Jordan kicks
As I matured I did it for a brick
Be cautious, the price is up and down like the New York Knicks
I got O.G. respect and a new four fifth, cause

(Chorus X3)
