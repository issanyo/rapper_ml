[Verse 1]
Niggas love you when you north sendin em flicks
Hate you when you home and you chillin' in whips
The same ones who say "son I feel your shit"
Be like "fuck that nigga he ain't givin me shit."
Niggas be sick, literally stress is bad for you
Envious shits really weak man, is you hearin me?
Man up, women need niggas to fulfill their needs
Stand up, stop sleepin, live your dreams
Only a weak nigga tries to live off strength
And when faced with heavy burden, can't take the weight
When niggas know your secrets, it's a chance you take
And if your man hold it down, that's real, be thankful
Real recognize real, that ain't always true
A lot of people thrive while their mans eat (?)
Out of sight, out of mind, a few will remain true
It's not a game especially when they play you

[Hook]
It is what it is, it ain't what it was
Fakers keepin it real, hate is deeper than love
Nothin leaves, nothing you get, what you earn
As you reach valleys and peaks, you live and you learn
X2

[Verse 2]
As you mature, move on, forgive and forget
But be aware, some things you to live to regret
They say know your enemy, remember your friend
Who against you because he's no different from him
Especially when you on and he wish you was him, in the position you in
That's when resentment begins to manifest how insecure he mentally is
A weak nigga, affectin' his potential to win
Love is a home
Hate is where treachery lives around the corner; from death,drama, and felony bids
Tomorrow's not promised, today is a gift
The present determines what your legacy is
What you did yesterday you can never relive
To pursue it is to question of what your relevance is
Recognize the truth, so you're better prepared
For life's numerous tests or your destined to fail

[Hook]
