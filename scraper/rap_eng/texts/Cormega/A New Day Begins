[Verse]
Under the sun vultures looming
Hoping to consume a culture wounded
Boldly refusing to die, I'm show and proving
I embodied what only few can
Wear sincerity not the robe of Judas
My golden rule is, live no lie
I know truth is part of my focus
Music, art imitates life, growth included
I'm bond by word, hold me to it
My heart and nerve are accountable, no excuses
I never made a deal with my soul included
I know what's real and I know illusions
Misery loves company, I chose seclusion
There's degrees to separation
I know my true friends, and forced alliances
Conspiring to deny you of hearing my aspiring rhyming is timeless
And genuine
That's where my mind is at: a reflective state
I weigh my mans like grams
Understanding there are losses when you measure weight
