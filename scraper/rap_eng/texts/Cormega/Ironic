[Verse 1: Havoc]
Made a little paper now, ain't it ironic?
Said I wouldn't make it, never make it out the projects
But they still there now, ain't it ironic?
My pockets do calistethics my shit so bolic
Can't fit it in my wallet, I don't sniff narcotic
Natural high, y'all niggas can't cop it
Had a fucked up life, for the world, wouldn't swap it
One hell of a story, might as well make a profit
My brother died young, round the same time as Biggie
So this ain't nothing new my heart was cold from the giddy
While niggas in the mirror tryna get all pretty
I'm fighting with the bouncers, get my team in with me
Spent nights in the cold, sipping on gold
It's not what you deserve, get what your hand hold
Forever, y'all fold for violating the code
Bitch feeling horny, all she gotta do is blow

[Hook: Havoc]
That mother fucker and that motherfucker
I ain't nothing like 'em, I'm that motherfucker
You body bag who? I ain't that motherfucker
It's a war going on, take that, motherfucker
Catch a fade now, nigga, got the cannons, motherfucker
We can trade shots where you standing, motherfucker
Leave your boy stiff, tryna tell you, motherfuckers
When niggas get hit, they some telling motherfuckers

[Verse 2: Cormega]
Everything you tryna do, I already did
Even if you wished me death, I already lived
And came up considerably, came from experience
Don't bite the hand that feed you, one day may get you rich
Is the emphasis in this conflicting myth of better living
The worst comes more often, remember this
Hate is no different than love that ain't genuine
Art imitates life, I convey realism
Schemes, I prepared for them, dreams I'm fulfilling, indeed
Odds I overcame are immeasurable
You find out who thorough when charges are federal
Weak links exposed when once seemed inseparable
A chain reaction, praise you had in the street
Ain't the same when you change your status
I stay adapting to make it happen
And made it out the same place you trapped in

[Hook: Havoc]
That mother fucker and that motherfucker
I ain't nothing like 'em, I'm that motherfucker
You body bag who? I ain't that motherfucker
It's a war going on, take that, motherfucker
Catch a fade now, nigga, got the cannons, motherfucker
We can trade shots where you standing, motherfucker
Leave your boy stiff, tryna tell you, motherfuckers
When niggas get hit, they some telling motherfuckers

[Verse 3: Giggs]
Who's who, my nigga? My nigga, who's who?
Gangster, niggas from YouTube'll get moved to
Coo coo, pussyhole nigga that's in a tutu
Two twos, man got the prick, my niggas move loose
Cognac, man got the yak, ain't sipping two juice
Think back when I gave Dubz the likkle deuce deuce
Tulse told Saj grab the champagne and get the Goose scoot
Toot toot, man grabbed a chick, a Betty Boop Boop
They never watched, never got the message
Never got the gwop, never got the method
Never watched a Glock, never got the effort
Never gonna stop, man forever kweff 'em
Metal under tops, never got the lesson
Man are from the Narm, never got the Peckham
Man have got the arms and we gotta get 'em
And man don't deal with can't's, man, I've gotta test 'em
Went and got the dank
Said they wanted light, went and got the lamp
Buck said it was light, went and got the champ
Man was on the ite, went and popped the champs
Man was on their bikes, went and got the shanks
Then I switched the life, now I've got the stamp
Swimming for their lives when man got the plank
And man was getting by, now I got the bank

[Hook: Havoc]
That mother fucker and that motherfucker
I ain't nothing like 'em, I'm that motherfucker
You body bag who? I ain't that motherfucker
It's a war going on, take that, motherfucker
Catch a fade now, nigga, got the cannons, motherfucker
We can trade shots where you standing, motherfucker
Leave your boy stiff, tryna tell you, motherfuckers
When niggas get hit, they some telling motherfuckers
