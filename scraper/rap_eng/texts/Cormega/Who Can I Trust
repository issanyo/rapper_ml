Cormega: yo
Lil Wayne: whats up

Lil Wayne: for real , for realla siht
Guerilla war
Lil Wayne: yo
Hot Boy: guerilla war what
What
Guerilla war what
For real , hot boys niggas

(verse one : cormega)
I write rhymes for niggas at nighttime
Consider your life mines
Whether you pumping five packs or five pies
Montana living it my persona imminent
Real niggas don’t keep beef we finish it
No retreat no surrendering
No rocking me to sleep
I keep the heat up in my premises
A whole different level of rhymes
Several of my competitors tried
Coming better than mines
Verbally in way ahead of my time
Mega in glamourized through words
Son in living off the dimes you served
Staying focused keeping an eye open for stray vultures
Everybody got to go every day is a day closer
I’m soaking in my sofa
Reminiscing Tony coked up
Life is fucked up
Even when you blow up

(Chorus)
Lil Wayne: Who can you trust?
Cormega: Only a few and my nine I bust
Lil Wayne: What do you lust
Cormega: The money and the power nigga
Lil Wayne : Who you respect
Cormega : All my niggas that’s no longer with us
And all the drug kingpins that showed us how to get it
(2 times)

(Verse two : Cormega)
Who the nicest
Nigga spitting the trife shit
Ghetto drama saga is for niggas wit indictments
Flipping white shit
Screaming fuck the feds
Squeezing your heat at police
Till you come to your hospital bed
Thug general
Write rhymes for criminals to listen to
If you ain't real my shit ain't even meant for you
My pen stains the paper like blood
My mind is like a nine and my rhymes are like a slug
Before I snitch like a bitch
Id rather die like a thug
If they arraign me for banging
I throw my signal at the judge
I’m almighty
Defy me till these four fours beside me
Red light to guide me to your vital point
With my heater I anoint
You a second from death
My only regret that I emptied out my whole clip
Being sulk beyotch

(Chorus)

(Verse three : Cormega)
To my thugs
Its unconditional love
I’m giving you
I've been in and out the motherfucking system too
Hunger pains when I was younger made me ready to face
Consequences of life the street fed me
Ready rock chopped the punk that bought my high top dunks
And crack fiends sold me a baby Nah.. Hold up
This ain't some shit I just made up in a rhyme this the realness
In a reflection of a sinner I spit
Yo feel this
My name alone have me maintaning a phone
On a come thru, not to mention a banger I own
Ain't nothing new why the fuck would I front for you
I'm a felony offender you showing your jealousy nigga

(Chorus)
Cormega: Who can I trust, who can I trust, word up nigga
Lil Wayne: Hot boy nigga, cash money nigga, guerilla war nigga
Get it right and keep it right
You need to be down to get up
Cormega: Yeah Nigga
