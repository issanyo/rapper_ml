[Verse 1: Cormega]
If I'm not in your top 5, I don't mind
If I'm not in your top 10, we could still be friends
If I'm not in your top 20, it wouldn't offend me
If I'm not in your top 30, maybe I ain't worthy
If I'm not in your top 40, there was others before me who was nice on the mic, they deserve more glory
If I'm not in your top 50, maybe you ain't hear me
If I'm not in your top 60, maybe you ain't feel me
If I'm not in your top 70, you're starting to worry me, presently, rappers ain't ready for me
If I'm not in your top 80, you're trying to play me
If I'm not in your top 90, nigga, what is you crazy?
If I'm not in your top 100, I'mma say fuck it
It is what it is, your opinion means nothing
