[Verse One]
Your son's stressin' you out
When he was home, he showed no respect for ya house
Now he locked up, callin' collect and you about to put a block on your phone, till he says you're the only one helpin' him out
He said his friends ain't there for him
He wished he'd listened when you said they don't care for him
Every night, before you sleep you say a pray for him
You even blame yourself cause you couldn't pay bail for him
You raised him the best you could
He respect you more now
Cause you're his best friend in the hood
He said he love you and he's sorry for the trouble he cause you
And it isn't because you he in there, so live ya lifeâ€¦

[Chorus]
This life, oh, this life
I promise to keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin'
I'm gon' do it right
So there won't have to be no troubles in my life

[Verse Two]
You single and strugglin', sleepin' with dudes
Get no feelings involved, they trickin' on you
You think you gettin over, as time flies you gettin older
You waking up with nobody to hold ya
You're like bad dope, nobody want you
Haunted by your past ghosts, they used to run through
Changin' is your last hope, but do you want to?
Are you still sensual prey when dealers come through?
Is your respect worth losin' for the next man's wealth?
Look in the mirror, stare at yourself
Everything you do in darkness will come to the light
Stop fighting your conscience and live ya life...

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
You had an addiction
It was so clear, child welfare came into your home
And apprehended your children
Now you faced with a decision
What ya love more: stimulation or your children?
The choice is yours, in the presence of evil
You started sniffin', boy, you was scared of them needles
Your man died from sharin' with people
You know that dope good if you said "it's diesel"
Now you staring at your kid's room, but it don't seem true
It's sunny outside, but it don't seem blue
You got kids who need you, what you gonna do?
The only way you gonna make things right
Is to get yourself together and live ya life...

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on strugglin' [4X]
