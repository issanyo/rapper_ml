[Cormega]

My moms put me on this earth for one purpose to rep
I love life too much to keep flirting with death
I swallow my pride
I no longer thirst success
The things we can't change we must learn to accept
They say money's the root of evil
Sadly your own family tree won't feed you or help your seed bloom
Yet they constantly gossip like they exceed you
Don't talk about it be about it
I speak truth
My knowledge of the street grew
As did my desire for jeeps and coupes and heat where rapid fire plagued my youth
I paid my dues in math to survival
Rappers are liars my factual rhyming surpasses my rivals are in massive denial
Talent defines me like Mark Jackson on the fast break the past is behind me
