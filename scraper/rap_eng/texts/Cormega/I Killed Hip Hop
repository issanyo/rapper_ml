I Killed Hip-Hop (feat. Cormega)

[Intro: Lil B]
I killed hip-hop
I killed hip-hop
This what y'all wanted right?
Lil B

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I walked around the corner
Hot smoke from the gun smoke
Always taking jobs but this job was unusual
I'm Lil B the Hitman
Based god my sixth man
Hollowed tips is the pen you know I don't forget the pad
This dude named Hip-Hop
He old and his hips rock
He need to get off the block there's new blood around town
A lot of people told me that
They tired of the same rules
Everybody scared to say something and they scared to move
Anonymous call-a-card my phone with a new job
Usually don't take blocked calls but he beat the odds
I heard it in his voice that he really wanna get it done
Told him I don't play games I don't do this for fun
I need an advance of a couple million dollars
No 360 deals and no album options
Before I seal the deal on another rap slayer
I'm picking up my phone I'm finna call Cormega

[Hook: Lil B]
I killed Hip-Hop

[Cormega speaking]
What up dun
Man fuck niggas for real
Small minds can't see the big picture
Get money
Know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Just had the conversation
I'm finna take the job now the record label see I ain't the one to think he soft
So I got to pay the DJ cuz he got the info
I'll pay BET just to open up the window
Whatever that I gotta I'm searching for Hip-Hop
Don't fit the description maybe this an odd job
I'm feeling like in secrets I walk down the streets
New York Times Square nobody can see me
I search in the studios for old record contracts
Any new leads, major label contracts
Any old vinyls or any new records
Talk to engineers that stole Pro Tools sessions
I studied all the greats I learned from the East Coast
Went to the West Coast where we got the deep smoke
I bought a new gun and I'm finna make his hips rock
Don't forget the day that Lil B killed Hip-Hop

[Hook: Lil B]
I Killed Hip-Hop

[Cormega speaking]
Yo do what you doin' my nigga
Know what I'm sayin'
You came to New York, you killed Santos
You buzzin on the net right now
You got they attention, keep they attention
Know what I'm sayin'
Get you a good lawyer, get your publishing
If you can get your masters, get 'em
Hold on to that, know what I mean?
Fuck niggas man
It's all about that paper
