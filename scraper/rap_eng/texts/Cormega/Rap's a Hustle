[Verse 1]
I'ma pimp, a pen's my ho
She don't ever move until I say so
Her only purpose in life is get me large
I got my pen workin' 16 bars
When I'm happy she happy, sad she sad
She make sure we both have
She know I got plenty more to replace her
Bitch better have mine
I'm not lettin' no pen get out of line
You did it, I mean, can you dig it?
She committed to me, she please niggas for me
My shit's so tight, she leave a nigga for me
I met her in a studio, she caught my eye
She was with a mac over kickin' wack ass rhymes
I needed a pen, so he let me borrow her
Like my shit ain't ill enough to overpower her
I see he wasn't treatin' her right
I gave her some paper
And let her do her thing that night
That's right, I took it from that player
He to concerned with his money and his pager
She told me, shit he be kickin' is so weak
I told him, your ho chose me I'm Goldie
Be cool, or we can make the heat come out
Your pen work for me 'til the ink run out (player)

[Chorus]
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street I'm goin' for mines
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street nigga

[Verse 2]
Yo, my rap is uncut raw, out the door
Type shit to have fiends lookin' for more
Your rap is lactose; you cooled off, the glass broke
Customers complainin' some never comin' back yo
My rap flow is pure all white, in the hood all night
You made your first sale when I sold out
My shit numbs your whole mouth, yours leaves a foul taste
My rhymes a felony yours never seen a trial date
You need a legal aid, my pen got the DA's paid
My flow's sleepin' in a cave
No day's I got the streets in this mad
You need a mask to prepare, this beat right here is heated glass
Once I flip this track (Uh)
You should see my stash, I got rhymes for days
Fuckin' right crime pays, I stay deliverin, ain't no middle men
I never short my man or cross my fans
Or switch my supply when money cross my hand
It's funny, I'm here, unlike the crew I used to roll wit'
You might as well work for me, I got the clientele
You put too much cut in that stuff y'all tried to sell
That's the reason your empire fell like Goliath
I'm supplyin' the ghetto to satisfy you
Marks, NARCs, is analyzin'  askin why this kid
Out the bridge and came through with platinum shinin'
Bringin' heat to the street like I had the iron
Fo' real

[Chorus]
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
Only the strong survive, I was born to rhyme
Put me on the street I'm goin' for mines
Money talks and bullshit walks
Rap is a hustle y'all
