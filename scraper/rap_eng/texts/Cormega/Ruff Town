[Hook: Roc Marciano]
Sometimes you're up, some down
I grew up in a rough town
Bust around smoke a bus down
I'm not the one to fuck around (fuck around)

[Verse 1: Roc Marciano]
I'm focused marvel at the opus,
Dangerous when at my brokest (uh)
Sold to smokers
Deal with brokers in the alley
Ten different drugs it might vary
Eat to carry and dally through the deepest valley no battery
And my back is eager to bring agony
Niggas on my dick shits flattering
And word, I hate to sound arrogant
But my Dsquared tees is two hundred a pop
My shoe ain't got a spot on the bottom or the top
Fresh out the box you ain't never seen these
Vietnamese appeased by the deities
While the naive ? with the thieves
I lay back in fatigues with the calfskin sleeves
Moral of the story is I'm fallin in the DeLorean
Disorient where the weather's the stormiest
Y'all niggas is the corniest
My coordinates forever close to where the water is
Relaxation, black bitches naked
The rituals are sacred, Cristal by the cases
Sniff the vapors out of spliff papers
It's the evasive, Marc baby, accept no imitations (uh)
To make a long story short
Fuck the tough talk, you'll get brushed off (uh)

[Hook]
Sometimes you're up, some down
I grew up in a rough town
Bust around smoke a bus down
I'm not the one to fuck around (fuck around)

[Verse 2: Cormega]
All is fair in love and war
I'm in yo crib like bro-man from the 5th floor showin the four
Just chillin' (uh) respect given (uh), those dealin' more weight less feelings
Beef isn't my preference, I want green and fresh fish on blessed dishes
God willin' I reflect wisdom, embodies me I represent realness, it's what separates us they never came up in the game, they imitators.
Cowards die a thousand times living greater, won't compare to the spear eventually facing
Those who fit description, spittin' fiction altering fact they're inconsistent
They've never seen the belly of the beast within the system, they're just talk, no street credentials
