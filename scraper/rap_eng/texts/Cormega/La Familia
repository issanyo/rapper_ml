(Intro) Movie Sample
"They can get to anyone, anywhere."

"Drugs, gambling, prostitution, all cash, all moved off shore
And 30% of their clients are legitiment
I wouldn't break this Firm
When that happens you're gonna go to jail like the rest of them
It'll happen someday believe me
Your life as you know it is over."

[Verse 1: Cormega]
Ayo, guns and roses, sons and soldiers
Drug game, cocaine, Ac's and Range Rovers
Snakes plan up ways to set their own man up
For grams when they bag them, Cristal White
At night pistols might lift you like heat seekin' missiles
Streets tempt you, police out to get you
'Cause niggas you ran with got knocked and snitched, too
Your bitch knew the time you faced, you didn't hide the safe
Now, she's fuckin' in your fly estate
By the fireplace, my shine stay laced
Minds original, Firm, La Familia, organized criminals, boy
You just a hand-to-hand soldier, I'm a general
One way ticket to hell is what I'm sendin' you
Yo, you idiot rookie cops know my props go high
Like Himalayan mountains
'Mega bouncin' in the Z-3, countin' up G's with no doubt, dun

[Verse 2: Nas]
I'd die for my niggas
Stick you for pies and lie for my niggas
Plead guilty, get the chair and fry for my niggas
It's essential that we all is A-Alike in mental
We've been through life, cold blood, livin' sinful
Though we learn from old thugs that made it
Peeped how they've played it
We rated and evaluated, calculated the ages we be
The days we see, chips freely, beyond whips and TV's
Stock bonds, loot flipped the CD's
But niggas hate to see you on top, they'd rather be you, what not
I keep the Desert Eagle pump cocked
Spot the Vickidees guy quick, why pop shit?
My niggas leave you shot quick in a hop skip
Specialize in fly shit
VS on my breath while niggas gossip on the tastics
I'm on some 'Doe or Die' shit

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Ill Na-na capo, The Firm, team Gestapo
36 moves, 37 ways triple days, triple pays
Na-na, Fox Boogie, Firm mama
Conniver, the Lady Godiva or Scarlet whichever O'Hara
The hazardous, we laced the Lazarus
Drippin' Gambinana, behind the liner, three Na-na's
From head to toe, laced up in Gabbana
With Sosa chip, the 4.6 Range Rover to Villanova
From Castilino to Columbo, Foxy Brown, papa
Beyond figures, boo, I'll die for my nigga's rollie
The Firm controlee, they chop ki's to clock G's
Rock crocky's and drop three's and cop 3's

[Verse 4: AZ]
Check my lingo and all the white ice that make my rings glow
I've seen doe, got a dime wife from San Domingo
Face it, it's mathematics basics, far from fake shit
My mind is sacred, my skin shines like a Cuban bracelet
Egyptian Pharaoh, potent ganja used to get me paro
Now I inhale from gunshots through my double barrel
Beneath the ground is how the sounds travel, so, what have you?
Keep in mind: Feds won't stop until they grab you
Used to bust guns, now it's just stocks and trust funds
G's and CDs so my seed can soon touch some
The foulness I once provoked is now behind me
It's gonna take more than sellin' coke now to bind me
You had me thinkin', "I gotta kill to keep from sinkin'"
The con way of life and keep live niggas from Lincoln
I saw it comin', that's why I slowed down from dumbin'
Most of my crew is runnin', can't even afford the summons
