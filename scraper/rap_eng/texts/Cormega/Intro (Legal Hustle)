Pardon me brother
As you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind
If I tell the whole story

I had the streets waiting
Like a drought, my niggas be patient
My daughter was recently born, I took a brief hiatus
Then Ty died, then I fell into a deep oasis
Others sparred, which reappeared, when Spree' was traded
Love is love, even with people hatingg
Niggas be slingin' daily, with no hope, expect for beatin' cases
I frequent places, where single mothers, are teens with babies
And fatherless homes are common as police who hate us
For the color of our skin, or the v's we came in
Rockin' these beats, doin' those sneakers, my scheme be plannin'
Since I came with The Realness, I been labeled the illest
Dealer, M.C., leavin' people amazed with my lyrics
We don't need you to feel us, just recognize
We in the building, with heaters concealed
Burnin' our name in the ceiling, Legal Hustle, nigga

My hood divided, I don't fuck with the niggas from the other side
My homies drop it, like flies
Painful timems have a nigga livin' reckless
All I expected was to see another day
Take my momma out the pj's, it got's to be another way
They pumpin' on my chest, and I'm screamin'
I stop breathing, my love one's leaving
Money never went to those that really need it
Brownsville, Bed-Stuy and Fort Green and
The whole Eastside's sayin' 'fuck the police'
On the mic, I'm a beast
The church tried to critize me for my disbelief
Mentally I'm at war, I'mma smorse' it all
Trials and tribulations, false accusations
Of me, being in deep, we'll shit, they rob me, nigga

Stay on a mission, checkin' my trigger, you niggas figure
Thinkin' for some reason, this ruger won't make your body shiver
But I'mma let you know, from the start
I was born at this game, now it's a shame to seen it torn apart
Moms cryin', never knew what son had beef
Kissin' his cheeks, and a heart's feelin' nothin' but grief
Receivin' reefs, placin' him at his feet
It's kinda fucked up, to see things happenin' in the streets
Nine-three it was ill in my town
You either buck now, or lay down, or let a nigga feel your pound
That's how it be up in the streets
Money hungry bitches is bigger, noted
But to just let them live, I'm for this eat
And I'mma tell you about niggas with money
Sorry to say but us blacks be actin' real funny
That's why I deaded Moe on the eighth
Because every time we drama, he always end up coming late
Nowadays niggas get snaked for being fake
Airin' cats out, and takin' trips out of state
That's how it be up in the city, where niggas act shitty
Gettin' shift and pretty, I'm trynna hold like Biggie
You niggas with me, against me, don't' try to stick me
Playin' both sides, I'm bustin' you until I'm empty
Legal Hustle, nigga..
