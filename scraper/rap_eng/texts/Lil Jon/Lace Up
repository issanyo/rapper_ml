[Intro: Lil Jon]
Hey, hey!
MGK Bitch! MGK Bitch!
Yuhhh
Lil Jon, Lil Jon (Kells)
I need to see the motherfucking L's in the air! (Put 'em up)

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ok, where the strong at?
Right there, put me on that
Hit it once and you're jumping like Mortal Kombat
Smoking all the green they be looking like "where the lawn at?"
And you know I'm gonna raise till I face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn them EST boy's done came up
Dirty-ass Chucks and a bad bitch, lace up
Lace up
Lace up
Lace up
Lace up
Ok (ok), where the strong at?
Right there (right there), put me on that
Hit it once and you're jumping like Mortal Kombat
Smoking all the green they be looking like "where the lawn at?"
And you know I'm gonna raise till I face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn them EST boy's done came up
Dirty-ass Chucks and a bad bitch, lace up

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Where my Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
My Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
All I know, all I know
I am from the city where the grass don't grow
I am from the city in the middle of the map
Where half these muthafuckers that rap don't go
All I know, all I know
If I throw this cash then her ass get slow
But I am from the city where the cash don't blow
So I came up for myself and smash that ho
Smash that ho, smash that ho
Treat her like a Bop It and I pass that ho
And I ain't saying nothing that my fans don't know
I'm an EST boy till the casket close
Six foot deep, six foot three
Eight mo'fuckers in the SUV
Eight new states in a seven day week
Whole world laced up like some brand new sneaks, yeah
And they know I'm gonna raise till I'm face up
Fuck check-out time, we don't wake up
Damn these EST boy's done came up
Dirty-ass Chucks and a bad bitch, lace up

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Where my Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
My Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
Run through the motherfucking club, pushing
Moving bitches out the fucking way, mush 'em
Wave my drink in the motherfucking air, fuck it
City and my muthafucking hood, I rep it
Bitches getting out of fucking line, check 'em
Right in the muthafucking nuts, sock 'em
Drank too much muthafucking liquor, I'm fucked up
L's in the muthafucking air, we laced up
We laced up, we laced up, we laced up
We laced up
We laced up, we laced up

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Where my Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Where my Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
My Eastside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Westside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Northside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
Southside muthafuckers? Laced Up!
