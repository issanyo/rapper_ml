26's got me big big wheelin
Money over bitches, I'mma get me a million
Thangs done changed, I'm hotter than a flame
So it's no time for me to beef with Jada, Joe or Game (Game)
Diamonds in my chain (chain) a Chevy in my yard
And a baby blue Phantom that I keep in the garage (uh-oh!)
C'mere, let me talk to you, show you what my grill 'bout
Ice like Paul Wall but I can't take mine out (YEAHHH!)
Let's play the game "Big Bank Take Lil' Bank"
Flood it like Katrina, make sure that your ship sank (damn!)
You would think money's growin on trees
The way your boy run through a couple hundred G's
Fresh white tee 'bout to get my hustle on (yeah!)
I ain't goin to the club, 'til all my work gone (C'MON!)
I'm leanin on the leather, and grippin on the wood
And I can build whatever, you know my money good, yeah

[Hook: Young Buck]
If can get money (money) I be in the hood (hood)
I be stackin paper like a real nigga should
My money good - GET MONEY!! We ballin in the hood
Money good - GET MONEY!! We ballin in the hood
I be pimpin hard (hard) and I got them hoes (hoes)
You ain't gotta ask me, you already know
My money good - GET MONEY!! We ballin in the hod
Money good - GET MONEY!! We ballin in the hod

[Young Buck]
I got my mind on my money (money) my money on my mind (mind)
I'm good in the hood so you know I'm gon' shine
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some (YEAHHHH!)
I'm sellin everythang (thang) and savin every dime (dime)
I'm good in the hood so you know I'm gon' shine
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some
Get you some, get you some, get you some, get you some (YEAHHHHH!)

Fifty for the watch (watch) a hundred for the bracelet
I'm headed to the top (top) I can damn near taste it
I represent my block (block) and give away the ones (c'mon!)
The hustle never stops so my job is never done (ayy!)
So tell me what it costs (costs) and show me who the boss (boss)
Put your money where your mouth is, I'mma break him off (break him off)
If you wanna know the reason why I act like that
I can fit a half a mil' in this Louie backpack, yeah

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Young Buck]
Go and do your thang (thang) just don't get caught
Let your money talk (HEY!) I let my money talk for me
If shorty wanna hate, then tell the bitch to walk
Let your money talk (HEY!) I let my money talk for me

Call me what you want, but you can't call me broke (broke)
Cause gettin big bags of money's all we know (know)
Marble floors in the projects, ghetto millionaire
All this Gucci in my closet, I don't know what to wear (yeah!)
Bentley outside by the ice cream truck (truck)
Just ride through the hood, ask 'em if they seen Buck (Buck)
Thought I wouldn't make it, but look at me now
That's why I painted the Benz the same color as Cristal (LET'S GO!)
