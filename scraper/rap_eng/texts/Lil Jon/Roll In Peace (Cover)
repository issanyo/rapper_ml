[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
No-no-no, oh

[Chorus]
I can't even roll in peace
Everybody notice me
I can't even go to sleep
I'm rolling on a bean
They tried to give me life
Got on my knees, said "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gonna ride for me
You ain't showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said you was gon' ride for me

[Verse]
My bad, I was tryna put you first, put my name last
Skipping class, you was out putting in work with all the fa-ah
You be on my posts, you liking my page, I don't even follow you
You say what you say, throw dirt on my name and I do what I gotta do
You took a leap of faith, you went all the way and I couldn't make it out to you
You were so doubtful
But sometimes everyone falls in love, sometimes
Sometimes we fall and we get let down
I don't know why you call, why you hit my line
'Cause I can't be yours and you can't be mine

[Chorus]
I can't even roll in peace
Everybody notice me
I can't even go to sleep
I'm rolling on a bean
They tried to give me life
Got on my knees, said "Jesus, please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gonna ride for me
You ain't showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said you was gon' ride for me
