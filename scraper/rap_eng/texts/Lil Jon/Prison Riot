[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
I came in this bitch to sweat!
I came in this bitch to wild the fuck out!
I came in this bitch to turn up!

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Jon]
Shit, me and my niggas in here fucked up!
Ain't no tellin' what we're gonna do when the fuckin' bass drops!
Fuck it!
Act up like a mothafuckin' prison riot!

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Fuck it!

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
Put your middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up, cause you don't give a fuck
Put your middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
I came in this bitch to fuckin' rave!
I came in this bitch to smoke the fuck out!
I came in this bitch to get plurnt!

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Jon]
Shit, me and my niggas in here fucked up!
Ain't no tellin' what we're gonna do when the fuckin' bass drops!
Fuck it!
Act up like a mothafuckin' prison riot (riot, riot, riot)!

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Fuck it!

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
Put your middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up, cause you don't give a fuck
Put your middle fingers up, if you don't give a fuck
Middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck
