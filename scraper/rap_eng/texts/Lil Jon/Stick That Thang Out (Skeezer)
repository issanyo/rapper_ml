Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up! turn me up!
Yo! turn me up, turn me up! up some more!
Up - up some more! Up - up some more!

[Verse: Pharrell Williams]
I walk in the club so dashin, in the latest BBC fashion
The light from the strip club flashing
Keep the sparkle in my ear rings dancing
We're hundred G makers till they cremate us
Skateboard P in the lime green gators
White chinchilla, million dollar neck glitter
Yeah I got security, see that gorilla
When you got money, it's hard to hide it
Took my hand out my pocket and watched her eyes get
Big, took a million to supersize it
All the bitches saying hey like my name was Issac
Why you put me on blast like that?
Shit why you shaking wit an ass like that?
Besides I wasn't really trying to smash like that
I got a girl - bitch I ain't fast like that
This Miami, time's wasting, bet that bass line keep you shaking
Look, end of the night all my niggas is waiting
Uh uh, not me ma, told ya I'm taken

[Hook: Pharrell Williams & Lil Jon]

[Verse: Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz]
I said ain't nothing but tutti fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Shake what ya momma gave ya, shake what ya momma gave ya
I said ain't nothing but tutti fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Shake what ya momma gave ya, shake what ya momma gave ya
Dance, too much booty in your pants
Dance, too much booty in your pants

Dance, too much booty in your pants
Well shake that ass bitch and let me see what ya got
Well shake that ass bitch and let me see what ya got
Hey! hey! hey! I said shake it, don't break it
It took ya momma 9 months to make it
I say shake it, dont' break it

Well scrub the ground, scrub the ground, scrub the ground

I like a fine ass bitch, a down ass bitch
A money getting bitch, I love that shit
Cause she danced in the club, and yes she gon call

Nigga ain't spending more money than a lil bit
But I really love that shit, I love that shit!

[Verse: Kaine]

Get her off in the truck and she bound to suck
The ho love to bump, she don't like knee pads

Fat puddy cat wit a head that's trill
