[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Dr-dr-dr-dr-drop dead
Get out the way, I'm a supersoaker (hah)
Told her look back at it when she bend it over (woo)
Bow, bow, bow, bow, that's a supersoaker
Woke up with hangover, I ain't never sober (hah)
Supersoaker, supersoaker, supersoaker
Woke up with a hangover, I ain't never sober

[Refrain]
She like to play with her jungle
That pussy sweet like a mango
She take it from every angle
Beat it up, like a motherfuckin' monster

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pussy on a 4 wheeler, that's a vagi-suki (bit')
You on that comedy shit, my dick a scary movie (woo)
You an imposter, ravioli (hah, bit)
I'm on my new bitch, it's a brand new booty (hah)
Im a pitbull, Hennessy and Red Bull (hah)
Takin' body shots (yeah), like boxers do (yeah)
On a mission with a bitch, that's Tom Cruise (yeah)
Im a Tycoon, fresh out of ice shool
Gettin' head on a heli pad
Hell yeah, helicopter when that chopper blam
Came in the gate, 400 grand, I had a plan
So be ready when I

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Dr-dr-dr-dr-drop dead
Get out the way, I'm a supersoaker (hah)
Told her look back at it when she bend it over (woo)
Bow, bow, bow, bow, that's a supersoaker
Woke up with hangover, I ain't never sober (hah)
Supersoaker, supersoaker, supersoaker
Woke up with a hangover, I ain't never sober

[Refrain]
She like to play with her jungle
That pussy sweet like a mango
She take it from every angle (hah)
Beat it up, like a motherfuckin' monster

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Okay, how many bitches I gotta fuck tonight?
I'm thinking 3, but a nigga gotta catch a flight
I'm married to the money, gon' an throw the rice
Who you playing games with, I ain't Fisher Price
I got 200 on the dash, I'm 'bout to run the lights
I put a million on that ass, I'm 'bout to change her life
I'm 'bout to bus' a nut, all over them pearly whites
Mean muggin' in that pussy, I ain't never nice
She like to play with that jungle
I crawl in that pussy, make her pussy crumble
I formation, a nigga ain't gon' fumble
Right up in that hole, gorilla in the jungle

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Dr-dr-dr-dr-drop dead
Get out the way, I'm a supersoaker (hah)
Told her look back at it when she bend it over (woo)
Bow, bow, bow, bow, that's a supersoaker
Woke up with hangover, I ain't never sober (hah)
Supersoaker, supersoaker, supersoaker
Woke up with a hangover, I ain't never sober

[Refrain]
She like to play with her jungle
That pussy sweet like a mango
She take it from every angle
Beat it up, like a motherfuckin' monster
