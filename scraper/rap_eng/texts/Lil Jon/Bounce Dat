[Verse 2: Chyna Whyte]
I'ma shake-shake it like I wanna
Bounce-bounce it on the floor make you see I wanna
Walk-walk it like a dog right there on the corner
Make you say "Who that girl with that Thug Life tatted on her"
See people want it ha that's how we do
Screamin' "Ahh-yah-ya-yah" me and my crew
Live in a zoo
That why I got a strap too
Twurk that ass if I want blow a bag boo
And act a donkey, act a monkey
Get a fifth of gin to see this chick get funky like a junkie
Show what this raw darlin'
6 years of hustlin', see where it brought me
This ghetto monkey, I'm livin' lawless
Livin' life is the hardest
Tryin' to live marvelous in a world full of garbage
I'ma talk it
If you don't want it, don't start it
Cause I'ma put it down the way you want it
Nigga
