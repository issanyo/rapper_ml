[Ciara:]
Every time he call - I come
But, this time I think about Me! (that's right!)
And what I need (that's right!)
Tonight I'm doin' Me! (that's right!)
And I ma havin' fun! (that's right!)

[Lil' Jon:] I bet you won't get crunk

[Ciara:] That's my jam

[Lil' Jon:] Get crunk, get crunk
[Ciara:] That's right, that's right (ooooh)

[Lil' Jon:]
Let's go
Let's go now, now ladies
Let's go, let's go now
If you always
Let's go, let's go now
Looking out for everybody else
Let's go, let's go now and not yourself
Let's go, let's go now, tonight
Let's go, let's go now
It's all about you, we gon' party baby
Let's go, let's go now
C'mon, crank that thang c'mon [8x]

[Verse 1: Ciara:]
I was driving, cruisin' on the highway...
It was a Friday, midnight, when he called me...
I was thinking "HELL NO!"
I already know what he wants: SURPRISE - SURPRISE
So I changed plans and made some arrangements
I won't be chasing, someone that's replacing, and..
That's when I called my girls up..
We about to hit the club up...
Tonight's the night (let's go..)

[Bridge:]
You can miss me all you want
But I'm not coming over
Tonight I'm doing me
I'll call you in the morning (that's right)
Hanging with my girls
Until the break of dawn
You can't tell me no
'Cause I can do what I want

[Chorus:]
Tonight I'm having fun
Tonight I'm going out
Let's ride up in a party
All night long
I'm turning off my phone
So we can get it on
O-ooh, o-ooh, o-ooh

[Verse 2: Ciara]
He kept sending e-mails
Asking for details
"When are you leaving?"
"When will you get here?"
Kept calling my cell phone
I send him straight to voice mail
...leave a message {spoken}
I usually call back
This time I won't fall back
I know what the real be
You just wanna see me
'Cause he wanna

[Breakdown: Lil' Jon]
Tap, to tap, tap, tap, tap (that booty)
But he's not gonna get (that booty)
If he think that it's like that (uh)
He can think that's nothing

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Ciara]
I got my hands up on my back, back
Take it to the flow, flow
We gon' ride on out, that's right, take it down low, that's right
What's up? I'm hot tonight
What's up? We in the spot tonight
What's up? That's right, that's right, that's right
Like this uh this, like that, that, that
JOHN drop the beat and bring it back, back, back!!
Wassup? Wassup? That's right, that's right
You like it? I like it!
You love it? I love it!
You want it? You want it?
Wassup? Wassup?

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lil' Jon]
Crank that thang, c'mon
