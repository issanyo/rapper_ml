[Oobie]
There's something, that I gotta tell ya'
Cause I know, that a brother got needs tonight
I ain't trippin' on ya' pimpin' cause that shit's tight
But you gotta pay tonight, tonight, tonight

(Chorus)
I know you wanna get laid tonight
But I'm tryin' to get paid tonight
We ain't even gotta fuss and fight
Just hit me right, it's on all night
I know you wanna get in bed with me
But you gotta come correctly
Nothin' in life is free, especially not me

[Verse 1--Oobie]
I hope you...can feel me
When I say pay before you play with me
Wanna taste this....but it's priceless
It might be something you ain’t never done before, but I'm not your ordinary ho

(Chorus)

[Verse 2—Big Sam]
I fell off in the club (shawty)
Not lookin' for love (shawty)
But I'm lookin' for a girl (shawty)
One I could cut (shawty)
Like lil mama in the blue (shawty)
So got damn cute (shawty)
But she say she need cheese (shawty)
Before she dip with me (shawty)
Well let me see (shawty)
What it might be (shawty)
And what's your fee (shawty)
For my fantasy (shawty)
Now I ain't rich (shawty)
But I spend a lil bit (shawty)
So who you wit? (shawty)
Let's do this shit (shawty)

(Chorus)

[Interlude]
There's something I gotta tell ya'
Before you lay with me tonight
I ain't got no problem with fly by nights
But you gotta pay tonight tonight tonight

[Verse 3--Lil' Jon]
What you talkin' 'bout? (shawty)
That didn’t come out ya mouth (shawty)
You say you want some cash (shawty)
Before I hit that ass (shawty)
I'm not yo' boy (shawty)
I ain't no toy (shawty)
Don't play no games (shawty)
Cause I ain't lame (shawty)
But for my girl (shawty)
I'll give her the world (shawty)
Ain't no thang (shawty)
To give up that change (shawty)
I ain't rich (shawty)
But I spend a lil bit (shawty)
So who you wit? (shawty)
Let's do this shit (shawty)

(Chorus)

[Oobie]
Now I'll be there for you
If you want me to
And I'll be by ya' side
If the price is right
Take care of me
And I'll take care of you
Nothin in life is free

Ohhh, yeahhh
I gotta get paid, ooh
Now if you want me
Come correctly
It might be something you ain’t never done before
But I'm not your ordinary ho
