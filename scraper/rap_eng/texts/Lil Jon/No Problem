You can get crunk in the club
Roll wit your hood
Get stomped in the club
Or you could get buck in the club
Get fucked up in the club
Nigga we don't give a fuck
But you don't want no problem (problem, hoo!)
But you don't want no problem (problem, hoo!)
But you don't want no problem with me
BME we be filthy deep

[Lil Scrappy]
You don't wanna be dead in the streets
Mouth full of blood, and soul full of heat (oooh!)
Why you tryna act hard as hell
And you know damn well you don't wanna feel the shell
Nigga I've been down by the law
Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall
I got big balls and bullets like baseballs
Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all y'all
Hell no them boys don't play
Straight nuts to ya face
Put ya pistol away
I don't please, put weed to my head
Pray for the folks in the club gettin' scared
Got a problem with that?

Hold 'em back, hold 'em back
Man fuck that nigga!
Fuck that hold 'em back
Gotta push that nigga!
Hold 'em back, hold 'em back
Push that nigga!
Fuck that hold 'em back

[Lil Scrappy]
Hey shawty its on
Goddamnit its on
Keep poppin' in my face and get popped in the dome
Learn to rush muthafuckas
Its gonna hurt
If a nigga fall (fall)
That's when shit gets worse
The problem with you niggas is
You just talk to much
Man swang on a nigga, and fuck his ass up
And you can walk on by with yo nuts in a tub
I'll beat yo block if you really won't get crunk
In the A we don't play them games
We just stack and slang and load up them thangs
Gettin' buck if you wanna and catch a bow
Keep yo pretty ass gul, beat your ass, and take your ho
