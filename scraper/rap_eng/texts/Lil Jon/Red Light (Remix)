[Usher]
Girl you let me have my way I was thinking I could get it again
Baby we could be friends if you lonely
And you show me
Just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind
Tell me were did you go


When you left (oh)
I'm thinkin which way did she go
I should have known that you would lead me on girl
Im in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreamin cuz i never felt like this before

[Hook]
[Chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

Yeah!
Yeah! (Crunck it out Luda)

[Ludacris]
She had a coke bottle shack really big booty small waist
I feel a little yozzy cause I really wanna see her face one more (let's go)
That woman's got me messed up in my head I forgot about my thought
And what I said all I could remember is one night more then (yea)
One hour on one floor (yea break it down)
There was one red light by the bed
That was glowing of her skin when I did my thang
We was dripping with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lost
Cause I really most of diggin her friend
All I wanna say is that we handle ours
And there ain't too many women that could handle stars
And what I wouldn't just one more time
For the chance to grip their handle bars

(Let's go)

[Hook]
[Chorus]
It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
But she's got me sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her

It was supposed to be
Just a one night
In and out and im out the door
So why am i sittin here
At the red light
Drivin round lookin out for her
Lookin out for her

Looking out for her!
