All my dreams came true
The day that I met you
Now it seems they’ve come apart
What am I supposed to do
If you say we’re through
Are you gonna break my heart

When your eyes light up they sparkle
Like sunshine through the rain
You’re the only one to chase away the pain

You lift me up
You turn me around
Make me a better man
Than I could ever plan
And I knew right from the start
Nobody else could take your place
You gotta understand that when you take my hand
You’re the only one who could ever break my heart
You’re the only one who could ever break my heart
You’re the only one who could ever break my heart


I remember then
Sometime way back when
You walked into the room and I knew pretty soon
I’d have to know your name
Teqilla down in one just to give me strength
Counted up to ten, and i held my breath
Suddenly aware,  I‘m standing by your chair
But everything was fine

Your eyes lit up and sparkled
Like diamonds though the rain
You’re the fire that turned a spark into a flame

Repeat Chorus

I just wanna be the one……X2

Repeat Chorus
