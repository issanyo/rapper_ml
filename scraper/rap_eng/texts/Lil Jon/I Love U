[Intro]
You know, I just wanna let you know
That I never felt this way about anybody else
I, I-I think I love you
So don't think I'm crazy when I tell you this
But if you ever hurt me I'll fucking kill you

[Hook]
You better go down when you get with me
You better realize I'm what you need
You better get here before I count to three
You better do right, I'll fuck you up

[Verse 1]
You never thought that a bitch like me
Would fuck you up if you cannot please
So you better bow down and get on your knees
Pull the diamonds out, gimme what I need
Hold up, do you see me laughing?
You think that it's a joke? I'ma start harassing
All you little hoes that be trying to pass here
You better tell them I'ma kick they ass in
What? Who are you talking to?
You better hang up or I'm through with you
And who the fuck is this bitch on your page
With her big ass tits up on your top 8

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch that's running the game
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch that's calling your name
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch I ain't got no shame
I will fuck you up

[Hook]
You better go down when you get with me
You better realize I'm what you need
You better get here before I count to three
You better do right I'll fuck you up

[Verse 2]
How come every time you go do it again?
(Why you always out late?)
Why you always drunk when you're with your friends?
Shut the fuck up and get in my Benz
Do what I say, I don't give a damn
You better obey if you want my nookie
You better stop talking to all them hoochies
You better wise up and listen to me
I will fuck you up
Hold up, you think I'm tripping now?
You asking all your friends why your ride is down
You wondering why your tires blown
And why your cell phone ain't work no more

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch that's running the game
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch that's calling your name
'Cause I'm the crazy bitch I ain't got no shame
I will fuck you up

[Hook]
You better go down when you get with me
You better realize I'm what you need
You better get here before I count to three
You better do right I'll fuck you up

[Bridge]
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yeah, gimme what I need
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Oh, yeah, gimme what I need

[Hook]
You better go down when you get with me
You better realize I'm what you need
You better get here before I count to three
You better do right I'll fuck you up
