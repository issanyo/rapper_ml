[Intro: Don P]
EYYYYYYYYY! Yee, hehe

Sell some motherfucking records first nigga (Eee eee, ayye!)
Ayyye! It's that nigga Don P
Trillville! BME Click! Yeeeeeeeeeah!

[Hook: Don P & Lil Atlanta]

[Verse 1: Don P]
Ayyye! Yeeeeeaahh! Aye!
Now err'body wanna fuckin' have they own label
Wouldn't on the first shit to bring to the table
They in they own fantasy somethin' like a fable
Handicap situations, all disabled
I shut 'em down like a computer
Cause ain't nobody fuckin' with the super producer
Corleone, TrillTown representative
"Fuck Don P!" Man some of y'all too sensitive
*Gun noises*
But you right - fuck me!
But ain't nun' day you gon' touch me
Talkin' 'bout: "Don P, why you buckin'?
Man you need to chill out get to the money"
I already got it!
And I'm a trill nigga, I handle all my problems
Besides, I'm all about respect
I'm a man, before anybody checkin'

[Hook: Don P & Lil Atlanta]
All that, talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit (Yeah shawty)

Man up motherfucker, man uuup!

[Verse 2: Lil Atlanta]
What you starin at? This ain't no free show
You gon make me cock back, hit ya ass in the door
Don't wanna do dat, hear them thangs click-clack
It goes in ya through the front, comes out through the back
Come and make my night! Love to talk but hate to fight
Once you a bitch, always a bitch, it don't go 'way ova night
Man up motherfucker, man up!
I told you once before, motherfucker stand up!
Hey!

[Hook: Don P & Lil Atlanta]
All that, talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit

[Verse 3: Dirty Mouth]
Now if you niggas keep playin', you gon' make a nigga tear a hole
Right through yo chest, is yo flesh, I can see yo soul
You don't wanna do that! I'mma hit you wit a bat
Talkin' all that shit nigga and I'mma hit you with the gat
17 times out the barrel of my .45
Four plus five equals nine, goin' through your spine
Sit your ass down ho! Make a move you gotta go
Erase you off the map and beat your ass at your own show
Ain't playin' no games with you lames when it comes to gangsta shit
Throwin' up my middle finger, grabbin' on my own dick
Niggas think they slick, take your pick, which one you want?
Bullets flyin' through your house or goin' straight through your throat?
Make your ass choke with different strokes of my hand movements
Say that you a G in these streets, man you gotta prove it
Next time I see you talkin', talkin' shit
I'mma rearrange your mouth and put your ass in a ditch, bitch!

[Hook: Don P & Lil Atlanta]
All that, talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit (Yeah shawty)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' that shit
Man up motherfucker, man uuup!
Man up motherfucker, man uuup!
Man up motherfucker, man uuup!
Man up motherfucker, man uuup!
