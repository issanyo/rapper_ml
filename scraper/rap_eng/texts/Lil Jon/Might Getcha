[Verse 1]
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry, bitch
Coming down screaming out "Southside's the shit"
Mississippi, dick sucker, keep my name off your lips
You don't know me, plus this gun lay right on my hip
Bustin' slugs at your bitch ass
Awww shit, Banner done it again
Seven hundred on them dubs, I done spun it again
She in
Ya'll thought a young nigga fell off
I was in Mexico sipping Sauza
With a Latin bitch, grippin' the grain
Mississippi motherfucker, ain't a damn thang changed (thang changed)
But this watch (yeah), and y'all hoes (yeah)
I went from Vogues (yeah), to 12 golds (yeah)
Went from fat ass tires to low-pros (low-pros)
Went from being alone to first chose (first chose)
You went from talking that shit to broke nose (broke nose)
I went from preaching to thugs (yeah), I'm so throwed (yeah)

[Verse 2]
We from the M, I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, I
Crooked letter, crooked letter, I
Hump back, hump back, I
Motherfucker die
Let a brother fry when we smoke that herb
'Til the boys reup, now we back on the curb
And they pack that shit, I told not to serve
I said "Move back", now you're working on my nerves
And I sniff that smooth, cock back now shoot
My hoe don't have if the hoe don't hoot
Screaming out "Church", "Life and school"
Keep 'em in line like coke lines too
95 South that is my hoo'
We rolling in Caddies, put hoes in the coupe
Just because I rap don't mean that I won't put a hole in a pussy ass nigga like you
One to the shoes, three to the phone
Keep talking shit and I'll kick in your door
So fresh and so clean when I'm in my Girbauds
Never deleted, they're still open toes
You thinking dirty when your hit the floor
You never beat down? That's how it's on
Calling them crackers, I want all my dough
Thundercat Thundercat, pimping these hoes
In the streets I control with the mode like a plug
You still wanna fight? Pussy nigga what's up?
Spite and I spar, mix it up in this club
Rapping like niggas who sound like "buff"
From Mississippi and I don't give a fuck
Never had nothing but God and my nuts
We bash in your head, my hunters will bust (yeah)
We letting you bleed from a kick to the skull (yeah)

[Chorus]
Might getcha jaw broke (jaw broke)
Might getcha wig split (wig split)
Might getcha car shot up (car shot up)
Might getcha door kicked (door kicked)

Might getcha car shot up (car shot up)
Might getcha door kicked (door kicked)
Might getcha kid-napped (kid-napped)
Might getcha neck snapped (neck snapped)
