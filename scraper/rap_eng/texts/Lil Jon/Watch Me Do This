[Verse 2: Dirty Mouth]
I'm in my fresh black tee with my black A-hat
Stacks on deck, six pack of that 'yack
On my way to Strokers, 'bout to tear the club down
VIP section, let me get another round
I'm chilling like a villain 'cause I'm trill as can be
All my niggas with me dreaded up with gold teeth
Ain't nobody trippin' cause we ain't with the beef
I'm just try'na have a good time while we chief
Now show me what you workin' with, shawty that's a fact
Oh, how you work that pole and twerk that ass from the back
Now get your homegirls 'cause my niggas wanna smack
That juicy ass booty that you clappin' like that
Damn, now do that one more time
'Cause if you don't work please believe you ain't gon' shine
So get on your grind 'cause it ain't hard to find
We doin' it real big in the back with the fine

You in the pink, 'specially one in the baby blue

I'm with my niggas so you know the money ain't a thang
And the way that I walk, you can tell my nuts hang
Do your thang, 'cause I like to see you shake it from the back
God, help err' nigga in here, pockets gonna flood
