Look at this mouth, look at these eyes
Look at these ears, look at this hair line
They match, they match the hairline
The ears, the mouth, the nose, the eyes the everything
You know damn well this yo' baby
You know this yo' baby, ten month old baby
Dante, you are not the father
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me, yeah
Shawtty Putt
Y'all know who this song for
This baby don't look nothing like me
Talk to 'em Shawtty Putt
Let's go, that baby ain't mine, I'm sorry
You are not the father, bitch, you heard Maury
I ain't buying no car seat and I ain't finna take care of no freak
Not me, not me, you ain't getting no trust up outta my check
But I will pay for that DNA test
I ain't buying no huggies, don't dress him like me
That ain't my lil buddy, them ain't my lips and them ain't my eyes
You can keep them big pitchas and the wallet size
That baby got a big nose, girl, look at mine
You can play blind but girl you needa stop trying
You can stop crying, girl, you can stop crying
You done pick the wrong one, baby, this time
It ain't my problem, Shawty, I can't smell you
Take him by my momma house girl she'll tell you
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
She's a stanking slut, she needa keep her knees closed
That baby look nothing like me, that baby cock eyed
And I got squinty eyes, we look different from head to toe
You think this baby looks like any of y'all
Now children, what do you say when you meet a nice man
Are you my daddy?
Naw, naw, naw, that baby look just like the reggae Sean Paul
And between me and you on the low, low
All the curly hair that baby look like Polo
I'm trynna tell you, I ain't that baby pappy
He way to crunk, you betta try Lil' Scrappy
Now I might be high but the more I look at him
Shawty look like T.I., I can't lie we was doing our thing
But that's a nappy head, baby, you betta try T-Pain
Naw, mayne, I can't claim him, I'm light skinned
That baby black like Akon, when I beat we didn't go meat to meat
You betta call Petey Pablo, didn't he say your name on freak a leak?
Shit try Gucci man, bitch, he might be but that baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
Dat baby don't look like me
