[Verse 1: T.I]
Now, everybody wanna be the king of the south
When, they ain't runnin' a damn thing but they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just statin y'all opinion
But in the south, and in the hood, its understood without sayin'
It's a given, and it ain't cuz of what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's, more because of what I do and how I'm livin'
Not to mention, when I'm rappin', I'm just hurtin' niggas feelings (niggas feelings)
And still chillin' on Simpson and Center Hillin'
Made provisions for the click and continue keepin' it pimpin'
Whether crack was in the house or record sales went through the ceilin'
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun, I shoot 22 from ya shoe to ya knees
I run a record label and a crew of Gs
So, niggas'll come and look for you if I sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say
And Be Easy, else it'll be a long day

[Chorus]
(I'm a king) Bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
(I'm a king) You pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
(I'm a king) Top topic of all of your magazines
(I'm a king) Head of the body, leader of the team
(I'm a king) Remember I can get your block knocked dawg
(I'm a king) A Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
(I'm a king) I'm connected nationwide, but in the south
(I'm a king) Just expect ya to keep my name out cha mouth
(I'm a king)

[Verse 2: C-Rod]
I'm a grand hot shelf, the last player left
Make a woman heart melt, I'm the ruler of myself (self)
Fresh when I walk, you got manure in your steps
The less a nigga talk, the more a boss is impressed
It's a mess when you flex, niggas take away your breathe
Leave you stretched on the west, take your head off your neck
Shit I feel like Shyne Po', I'll roll more or less (more or less)
45s in my sweats, I ride for the set
You ain't live as a Tek, assault rifle lover boy
I treat 'em like pets, solid gold bullets
I'll kill you with finesse (shh), this is not a test
Desert Es at your request, you was poppin' all that shit, now what do you suggest?
A bullet in your ass? Or a chopper in ya chest?
I'm knocking down walls, putting cities on my belt
The realest thing that I ever felt
I stepped inside the place and niggas knelt

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry King]
Shawty, I'm down with the kings, so call me the greatest
Number 1 hustler, I keep the street blazin'
If the grapes don't sell, I dry 'em up and sell raisins
Why y'all cherry-pickin' hustlers out here slavin'?
That cane shit nigga run deep in my veins
Pump through my heart, live in my bone marrow, mane
That's pimpin', my game is premium like octane
Can't tell me nothin' bout stackin' these benjamaynes

[Verse 4: T.I.]
I'm the king of the dirty, superseded in the throne
Overruled other dudes like Caesar did in Rome
With a presence so demandin' and an aura so strong
The south ain't been represented like this in so long
I'm an emperor, you best be glad I'm workin' on my temper
Otherwise I'd cock some pistols, send some missiles to your temple
Disrespect us I'ma blick up to ya, get ya, plain and simple
Brass knuckles to your dentals, blast suckas in they dimples

[Chorus]
