[Verse 1 - 8ball]
Full of all kinda drugs high as a giraffe
Pussy nigga better not get too close, Nigga better not try and push me
We got them thangs, I mean them thangs that go bang bang
Don't give a fuck who you with, don't give a fuck if you got some change
Take your necklace, take your watch, take your diamond rangs
Way back in the game, when a nigga use to have sell rock cocaine
Right now today, I'ma grab the mic and bring the pain
Go fucking insane, everything I say go straight to ya brain
Lil Jon on the beat, bout'a tear this bitch up out the frame
You better leave if you thing you just a little lame
Tuck your chain don't get caught when this here song come on
Look at my face, that's gon' tell you niggas something wrong

[Chorus - 8Ball & MJG]
I heard you niggas don't like me (like me)
I know you boys wanna fight me (fight me)
I know where your kids and yo wife be (wife be)
Buss a nigga head till da white meat (meat)

Buss a nigga head till da white meat (meat)

Real killers, tough niggas, loud mouth rough niggas
Can't stay out'a handcuff niggas ain't enough niggas
To run up niggas, I'm a, artillery specialist
Never da fucking less I get pimpin naturally effortless
Coming up outta regions where mu-a-fuckas is needin

Talking, pullin pistols out, shootin never shook me
You boys can't whoop me, listen what the hook be

Buss a nigga head till da white meat (meat)
