Heaven sent a nigga who enter this cold as the winter
Step away from the top, step away from the block
Step away from shootin' or gettin shot
Bitch nigga fuck that, you buck we buck back
What you think we cut slack for some kind of tough cat
Just 'cause some nigga was dead, with the head leakin out, pink and red leakin out, now them feds sneakin' out
Nigga fuck it, we'll hop in the bucket and haul ass
You was mad cause I seen you was creepin' in tall grass
I bust 'em all fast repeatedly and heatedly
Tried to make that mothafucker leave immediately

And I'm worldwide babygirl, show me some love
