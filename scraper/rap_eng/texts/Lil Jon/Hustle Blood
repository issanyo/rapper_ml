[Verse 1: Jamie Foxx]
Been patient, we both played our part in heartbreaking
Most time you hurt more than I, face it
Took blows to the heart, that's family
My mother been 20 years with a hustler
He always taught, never talk slick
A woman's place submit to a boss, couldn't take it
So many nights seein' momma on the couch stressin'
She lookin' at the clock, it's quarter past two
Next day, and still no sign of daddy
A hustler, always loyal to the customer
In love with the only example of family
I wanna say

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Debra Killings]
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come

[Verse 2: Big Boi & Debra Killings]
Waitin' for the day to come
Like waitin' on the mailman first of the month
I'm a straight go-getter, trend setter
Make her more wetter when a nigga bust
Dude, I keep her soakin' wet to the touch (I do)
No joke, can't stop 'til she get enough
Like a paper towel, quick to pick her up
Blow smoke, chop chop, let her hit the blunt, nigga, what?
Up, up, up and away (and away)
I ain't fin' to front, from the jump or the giddy up, bruh
It's plenty pretty bitties in the city I'm from
And I'm gon' get me just one
To ride shotgun, do you hear me? Just one, one
Bum bum diddy bum bum, bum bum bum diddy bum bummmm

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Debra Killings]
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come

[Interlude]
Waiting for this day to come, lady, come and give me some
You know you're my only one, just lay back, girl, have some fun
Now come over, let me squeeze, you so tightly, let me see
Just what you can do for me, drop down low and shake it, please

[Verse 3: Big Boi & Debra Killings]
Nothing in the world can keep us apart
Like Nettie and Seely from the start
My blood pumps red, but give me a purple heart instead
'Cause a nigga goes hard
Kinda like a egg boilin' in a pot of hot water (Hot water)
Or like a Fed with a no-knock warrant
I want her, so I'mma go and get her, ya hear me?
We got her surrounded, she gonna give it to me
Give it up, gift wrap, hands up
Handcuff with the wrists back, back up (Back up)
The type of chick'll make a nigga act up
Mask up, get the Cadillac and mash up
Any, and everything on site like a drop box Chevy
Bum bum diddy bum bum, bum bum bum diddy bum bummmm

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Debra Killings]
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come
Daddy said, when you hit 18
That you will never marry one like me
But didn't know you fell for a hustler
Hustle blood all in me, all in me
But I've been waitin' for this day to come

[Interlude]
Waiting for this day to come, lady, come and give me some
You know you're my only one, just lay back, girl, have some fun
Now come over, let me squeeze, you so tightly, let me see
Just what you can do for me, drop down low and shake it, please
