[Brooke Valentine]

It's about to be a girl fight


[Big Boi]

Uh huh, uh huh Big Boi

[Lil' Jon]

[Hook: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]
We 'bout to throw them bows

We 'bout to swang them thangs

We 'bout to throw them bows

We 'bout to swang them thangs

It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight


[Verse 1: Brooke Valentine]

There she go talkin' her mess

All around town makin' me stress

I need to get off my chest

And if her friend want some then she'll be next

It really ain't all that complicated

Y'all walkin' 'round lookin' all frustrated

Want some, Tex come on let's make it

You actin' real hard but I know your fakin'


[Bridge: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]

I know you really don't wanna listen to this

Really don't know why you talkin' shit

You about to catch one right in ya lip

It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight

I know you really don't wanna listen to this

Really don't know why you talkin' shit

You about to catch one right in ya lip

It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight


[Hook: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]


[Verse 2: Brooke Valentine]

We on our way to the neighborhood

The reason we comin' is understood

Me and my girls we down to ride

So when ya hear us pull up bring ya ass outside

And if tryin' to call ya cousin and them

Don't forget that I got some of them

I'm 'bout to go real hard, 'bout to swing them thangs

You 'bout to feel elbows all in ya brains


[Bridge: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]

I know you really don't wanna listen to this

Really don't know why you talkin' shit

You about to catch one right in ya lip

It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight


[Hook: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]


[Big Boi]

Oh snap, these bitches they act like cats

In the middle of the dance floor, now they preparing to scrap
They takin' out their scrunchies and pullin' off their Press-Ons

The one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is the other

Woman

Someone please call security
These girls too purty, to get down to the nitty titty

I mean the nitty gritty, I mean her titties pretty

I'm trippin' bein' silly willy

Man go on let them hoes fight


[Hook: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]


[Outro: Brooke Valenine with ad-libs]

Don't act like you dont know

We break upside ya dome

So be quick enough to block ya dome

And you won't be talkin' that no more


Don't act like you dont know

We break upside ya dome

So be quick enough to block ya dome

And you won't be talkin' that no more

Bitch come outside
