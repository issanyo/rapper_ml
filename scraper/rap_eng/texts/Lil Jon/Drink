[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah hey, yeah hey, yeah hey
Time to have some drinks, (drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks)
Lil Jon, LMFAO, baby
We came in the club, (yeah) to get real fucked up
And motherfuckin' party, how about you?
Let's go!

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink

[Post-Chorus: Lil Jon]
Everybody pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Hey, pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one, hey
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
Champagne, vodka, Don Julio tequila
Let's drink it all and get this party off the meter, hey
Ain't no saying no, (no), no, your ass needs a drink, (drink)
I don' drink so much I can't even fucking think, yeah
Damn, this party jumpin', the bass is really bumpin'
I see a little hottie, I need to tell her something
Yeah, you're looking sexy in your all pink
Stop being lame and have a fucking drink, let's go

[Hook: Lil Jon]
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink

[Post-Chorus: Lil Jon]
Everybody pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Hey, pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one, hey
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one

[Verse 2: SkyBlu]
First off, I'ma pro at this
I walk in the club with the coldest bitch
Straighten up, you better focus bitch
My glass's half empty, pour some shit
The matter of fact, go ahead and drink that
Couple more shots, yeah where your freak at
I peep that, now I need that
Treat your pussy like a record, go ahead and leak that

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
It's Red Foo, that dude up in the place
Party rock crew, we doin' it by the case
Champagne is like a player's mace
When the girl's act naughty we spray 'em up in the face
Yeah, it feels like college
I'll be the dude walking around with the beer goggles
We surrounded by models
Cause it looks like 4th of July when they bring them bottles

[Hook: Lil Jon]
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
One shot, two shot, three shot, four
Take the bottle to the head and one fucking more
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink

[Post-Chorus: Lil Jon]
Everybody pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Hey, pour me another one, hey, pour me another one
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one, hey
Pour me another one, hey, pour me another one

[Outro: Lil Jon & SkyBlu]
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Everybody, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink
Hey, drink, drink, drink, drink, pour me another one
