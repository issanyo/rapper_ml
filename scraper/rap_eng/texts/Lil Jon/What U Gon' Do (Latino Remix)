[Verse 1: Pitbull]
What them boys gonna do when we step to their face
Not a motherfucking thing, bitch
I see you act hard 'round your click
But by yourself you ain't shit
Them boys that snitch ain't shit
Them hoes over there ain't shit
That coke you got is stepped on, dawg
Your blow ain't shit
Therefore your dough ain't shit
Keep provoking, shit
These boys will Seven-Eleven your ass
And leave you open, bitch
They'll leave you leaking, soaking wet, believe me
We can show you how these gats get some smokin' here
Do you really, really want your head blown
Fucking Atkins diet, dawg, we eat your bread zone
Yeah, I'm biased when it comes to them feds, holmes
Like Len Bias, I'ma play 'til my heart's gone
So take it how you want it, personally I don't give a fuck
Either or you weren't gonna win them things, buck, buck, buck
Worst thing is, when you pull that trigger and that thing is stuck
Go ahead and get your click, what they gon' do? Shit

[Chorus: Lil Jon & Pitbull]
If you fall up in the club
And them nigga's wanna buck
When you step up to their face
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
If you fall up in the club
And them hoe's are actin' up
When you step up to them hoe's
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee:]
Si me tientan en pal de segundos sentirán el fuego
No es lo mismo llamarlo que verlo venir, pon tu cara al fuego
Que haces respaldando lo que boconie en la línea de fuego
No me huyas cobarde, y vamos al duelo!
Tu no eres un guarpetón, eso es producto de rum
Mutha' fucker wanna act
Como si tuviera el crea, y corazón
Porque andas con el vaquero de fulano y perensejo
No quiere decir que sea gangster
Sigues siendo el mismo (PENDEJO!)
La calle me llama, oh boy, I love da drama
Have you seen a boricua loco chasing you con un A.K
Hit the wrong way, no amenaces y deja el mensaje
Lo que vayas hacer lo haces y actúa,y ya deja el aguaje
Nos fajamos al gatillo, sino a fuerza de nudillo
Al antiguo, a uno a uno, cara a cara, y sin corillo
Los guantes put 'em up, no te quites, que paso, nigga' what
Daddy Yankee se revela, a la buena o a la mala
En tu cara, que tu vas hacer en el club

[Chorus: Lil Jon & Pitbull]
If you fall up in the club
And them nigga's wanna buck
When you step up to their face
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
If you fall up in the club
And them hoe's are actin' up
When you step up to them hoe's
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)
What they gon' do? (Shit!)
El no va hacer nada! (Shit!)

[Outro: Daddy Yankee & Pitbull]
Tu no vas a hacer nada! Roncón!
Con la boca has matado a miles!
Y con la pistola a nadie
Roncón, fequero!
Perro que ladra no muerde! Come mierda!
Tu lo que eres es más ruedo que película!
Pa' que lo sepas!
Boriqua, cubano, negro!
Lo que sea, ya tu sabes!
Lil' Jon, Pitbull, Daddy Yankee!
Hit them motherfuckers!
