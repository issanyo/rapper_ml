[Hook 1: Mohombi]
Over here, we always down
We down, to do it, yeah!
Over there, who always down
Who down, to do it, yeah!
Let's do it tonight

[Bridge 1: Lil Jon, Big Ali]
Been around the world, been a lot of place
Seen so many girls, seen so many faces
Tonight lets have a bomb
Tonight we'll start something up
Tonight we'll do it all, so if we haven't done it
Big Ali, NYC, and Lil Jon
Lil Jon, that's me!

[Pre-Hook 1: Mohombi,  Lil Jon  ,  Chris Reeder ]
Let's do it tonight
We're going hard tonight
Party people! Let's go

[Hook 2: Lil Jon]
Let's do it, do it
-Instrumental-

[Verse 1: Big Ali]
Hot as shit, tired as shit
Do it now, don't quit
Get with Sean, don't wait
Give a [?], don't hate
Hustle hard, get the millions
Cop a [?], times a ticket
Need more [?] and you'll see
Nothing that you can't achieve
Uh, but I never wait
Gotta get it while I can, [?]
Eat everything I can off the dinner plate
Motherfucka, let's switch like a booty shake, oh
Y'all wanna do something (something)
Then let's be clear (clear)
Ain't no better time than the present
Let's do it all!


[Hook 1: Mohombi]
Over here, we always down
We down, to do it, yeah!
Over there, who always down
Who down, to do it, yeah!
Let's do it tonight

[Bridge 2: Lil Jon, Big Ali]
Been around the world, been a lot of place
Seen so many girls, seen so many faces
Tonight lets have a bomb
Tonight we'll start something up
Tonight we'll do it all, so if we haven't done it

Disco tear the club up
Everybody stand up
