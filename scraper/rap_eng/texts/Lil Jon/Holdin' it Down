Dirty South, dirty mouth, yes, I'm guilty nigga
Keep a pistol by my side for dem filthy niggas
To these bitchez out there thinkin' they can tilt me nigga

Y'all got a track funky like fuckin' wit no ??? for nuthin'

Dappin' and huggin', these niggas and bitchez who give a fuck and...

My nigga the block hot, Glock on me
Tryina harm me nigga, we gon' bring a whole army
Swarm like bee's, street bleed from squeeze armin'
Supreme cream team, open shop whip stormin'

Repeat Chorus 2X

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, just lemme slide off into it
Pull out the rugerz, introduce you and yo kin to it
I hate the game, taught to neva be a friend to it
Still watchin' cornerz, and dem pistols put'em into it
I'm into it...

Bustin' ova niggas hatin' me like Jerome Bettis
Let it be known that I'm a lil' dirty red nigga
Blowin' yo mind like hangin' wit thirty dred niggas

Bitch, I'm a 9th ward, die-hard, pull yo card nigga

Soon as you see me comin', you holdin' yo bitchez close nigga!

Repeat Chorus 2X
