[Verse 3: Bo Hagon]
Look, look...
I was raised with killers
I ran with dealers
I smoke a blunt a day for my locked away niggas
My bread is stacked up
The club is packed up
My gage is racked up so don't you even act up
I've been dead wrong
So that that won't be new to me
Aside from killing me
There ain't shit you can do to me
The real for you to see
To peep out or what not
Dippin' through the projects to find a small spot
Yeah he from "Da BackWudz", Bo Hagon is hi'zzame
I spin fire shit for GA is hi'zzame
The time done c'izz'ame to crank up this bitch (Bia Bia)
And get this motherfucker droppin', boppin' this shit
See we so high the time'll go by
Rather fast, hit the grass, put that smoke in the sky
But a hustler'll hustle what a jacker's a jack
Southside, southside let me know where you at
My nigga!
