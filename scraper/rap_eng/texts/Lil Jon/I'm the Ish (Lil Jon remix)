Got patrone in my cup

Because I'm always out of town

Her booty's fat like yours

[Jermaine:]
See now I'd probably been in this sh*t the longest
I don't deal with the fake and the phoniest
Girls treat me like I'm one of the Jones's
Give her d*ck and all types of bonuses
I don't really even know who song this is
But I heard it and jumped right on this sh*t
If the shoe fit you better wear it
And I swear it you see me

She asked me what my name is
Told her I was famous
You don't know who Jermaine is
She must be brainless
Since the day I came in
Don't know where them lames went
But that ain't no issue
Baby get your boy some tissue

Cause I'm the sh*t
Fish you as my whistle
Got your chick she doesn't miss you
She'll be with you when she kiss you
She'll be licking on my missile
No homo see my logo
And you'll hold shows like it's promo
It's tight I had to force it
Now they call me porcelain

Cause I'm the sh*t
Yeah I'm the ****
Up in this b*tch
Up in this b*tch
Yeah I'm the sh*t
Yeah I'm the sh*t
Up in this b*tch
Up in this b*tch
Yeah I'm the sh*t
Yeah I'm the sh*t
