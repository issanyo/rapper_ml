[Verse 1: Pastor Troy]
All the way crunked up, that's my middle name
Pastor a Disaster, I'mma do my thang
I'm staying in my lane, I'm staying in the trunk
They know of I'm off da chain, they know the Pastor crunk
Waka Waka Flock go and get the Glock
Niggas think they're hot, they should take me to their spot
I got ammunition, I'mma act a fool
Any competition, bend them with the tool
P.T. on the cruise if you reppin' me or not
I'm drinkin' double shots
Try'na straighten up my knock
It's DSGB, your boy P.T
Now it's no "Wuzupp?"
You know that we crunked up!

Shawty up and shake it
Hear 'em buck it, I'm ike "Shawty what?!"

Drinkin' beer
Drinkin' here
Outta my mind
Crunked to the max
See a bad bitch and I'm throwing them stacks
[?] WHAT?!
Horse shit back
Headed for my back
Crunked to the max and my dreads gone wild
Rockstar shawty, might dive into the crowd
Protine kushin'
Smell we're loud
Leaned up like a harley
Dreadhead ike a Marley
Flocka in this party
You can call me "Brick Squad" shawty (Brick Squaaaaaad)
Fightin' in the club
Someone's goin' down now
Right, left hooo
I'mma knock his ass out
Put's yo down wit the hands full of pow
Make him hit the ground

Action y'all niggas just acting
Struggling like I'm frenzy
