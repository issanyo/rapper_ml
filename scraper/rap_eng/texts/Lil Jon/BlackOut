[Intro: Lil Jon]
Ya!
Lil Jon!
I said I wasn't drinking tonight, but you know what fuck it!
I think I'm gonna get so fucked up I might god damn blackout!
Juicy J, let's go!

[ Pre-Hook: Juicy J]
Put your hands in the air, let me know you out there
Put your hands in the air, let me know you out there
Put your hands in the air, let me know you out there
Put your hands in the air

[Hook : Juicy J]
Hungover and I'm back out
White party and I'm blacked out
Black card that just maxed out
I'm about to just black out
Hungover and I'm back out
White party and I'm blacked out
Black card that just maxed out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Miley Cyrus, Mary Poppins, lets get it poppin'
Rock out, that's Janis Joplin, she a red head no Dennis Rodman
Don't bullshit me, I'm a Red Bull sipper don't cut my wings
On the tail of the jet all you see is steam, gotta bad bitch nude in the front seat
She make it bounce, bring your body I bring an ounce
Don't chase pussy, that's cat and mouse
Every day I'm turnin' out

[Hook]
Hungover and I'm back out
White party and I'm blacked out
Black card that just maxed out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
I'm about to just black out
1,2,3, let´s go
I'm about to just black out

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up
If you gettin' fucked up, put your fuckin' cups up

[Hook]
Hungover and I'm back out
