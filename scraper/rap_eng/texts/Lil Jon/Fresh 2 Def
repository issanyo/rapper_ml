[Chorus: Benny Boy]
Everybody know we fresh to def
Fresh to def, fresh to def
We go up in the store and leave
Nothing left, cause we fresh to def

[Verse 1: Benny Boy]
Now everybody asking, "Benny How ya been?"
And I tell them I'm like MJ when he went to Washington
Even if my record stats is twenty three and 6
And I have a bad year, I am still considered sick
I am still considered good, I am still the best choice
And you actually got the nerve to compare me to them boys
Catching some attention is what brings them joy
I'm sick and stand out compare me to hemorrhoids
Ok don't compare me to hemorrhoids eww but look
Fresh like my granny's couch wrapped up in that plastic
No, fresh to death like glade plug-ins in a casket
"Glad plug-ins in a casket?" yeah fresh to death, forget it
Shirt looking phat like I've never done a sit-up
Pants looking clean like I always use a lint brush
And the shoes, It's ice cream kicks, yup
Even models ask us for fashion tips, cause

[Chorus: Benny Boy]
Everybody know we fresh to def
Fresh to def, fresh to def
We go up in the store and leave
Nothing left, cause we fresh to def
