[Bow Wow - talking]
Oh, oh
Uh huh, uh huh, oh
Let's take a pause for a minute
Let's go (*laughing*) (I)
Check it out man
See man, Bow Weezy right here live and direct (OH I)
I'm talkin to ya'll young n's out there baby
Can't wait until I turn eighteen
I know it's the same for ya'll man, I know, I know (I)
I'm talkin bout pullin up in them big cars on them 22's
Naw forget that, I'm talkin 'bout Charlie Woodson's man
I'm a pull up, I'm talkin bout 24's
It's a wrap for ya'll when I turn eighteen man
Haha, listen to the hook

[Hook] - w/ ad libs
When I turn eighteen
I need to ride on some rims that's clean
And them brand new J's when I hit the scene
When I turn eighteen
I need a girlfriend older than me
And she gonna have to be a dime if she rollin with me
When I turn eighteen
I pull up and stop, let my system knock
They all know I'm super cool when I drop the top
When I turn eighteen
I get my crib up on my first day
And every week we celebrate like it's my birthday
When I turn eighteen
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
I'm a be leanin and dippin, sittin on inches ridin
Gettin at women they lovin my every sentence
It's Weezy baby, from the truck, to the drop, to the Coupe to the high 2's
See that ya'll, you gotta believe me baby
The game tight and the bank right
Since fame came and the bright lights
You gotta release me baby, I can't be tied up
Can't be handcuffed to no chick at the party when I ride up
Cause I gotta mingle, I know I'm great with the lingo
But check it I gotta motivate, I just gotta be single
And yeah like when I see you, yeah like how you jingle
And yeah said I'm a ring you but baby I can't bring you
Can't wait 'til the day comes
When I wake up and I'm eighteen
Not a young pup but a big dog
And I bark loud and I switch cars
It sounds hard but it's not ya'll
When I get there that's it ya'll
Ninth day of the third month, it's on

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm up in that H2 with them wheels to match
Got them big dog speakers bumpin up in the back
Got that Snoop Dogg CD is what I insert
Roll down my windows, sounds like a concert
And on a beautiful day, I might just switch to the Rover
+So Fresh So Clean+ like Outkast, a PD can't pull me over
I'm +Big Pimpin+ like Jay-Z, steady "Stunnin" like Baby
"I Need A Girl" like Free, mixed with some Halle Berry
And a little hood which is good like Trina to be my lady
Just call me Cassius Clay, baby cause I'm the greatest
And can't nobody my age can ever ever fade this
I'm unfadeable, I'm untouchable
I'm on a mission now, I'm in transition now
B-O-double-double-O-double, ya'll
It's Bow Wow, I'm in the house now and I'm up outta the pound
Now listen to the hook, this how it's goin down

[Hook]

[Bow Wow - talking]
YEAH! (*laughing*)
You know what I'm sayin?
I'm speakin for all the young ones my age
You know what I mean?
Bein told you can't do this
You can't get in here and you wanna do it
This the song right here
This the anthem for us right here, cause I'm one of them
Always told no, you can't get in
But you know what
That's fittin to change man
Ha, when I

[Hook] - 2X
