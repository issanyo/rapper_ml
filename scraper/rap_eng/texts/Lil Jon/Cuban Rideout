[Intro]
Como? Yeah! Ha!
Lil Jon... Eastside Boyz... Que Vuelta!
That little cuban from Miami Pitbull!
I appreciate y'all giving me the oppurtunity to spit on this shit

[Verse 1]
When it comes to these hoes y'all know we on some halloween shit
Start trickin' n treatin'
But I'm on some halloween shit too
Gettin' messed up for the radication... BOOM!
From the palm trees to the red clay
We get down the same way
Lil Jon's from Scott but this little Cuban's from the County of Dade
Pitbull is here to voice his opinion and y'all gon hear it
All up and down The Eastside
Im'a show y'all how dirty we ride from Dade to Decatur
Only difference is y'all blow dro and we blow crip
But really there's no differecne cause they're both green and sticky
I don't mean to be picky but Jon...
Tell your boys from the Eastside to put me down with one of those redbone who has a pretty face n waist and thick thighs
From the M-I-A to the A-T-L
We been... uh, connecting on work but keep that on the DL

[Outro]
HAA! Asi mismo broder... Como?!
Yeah, Lil Jon, Eastside Boyz
P-I-T slash Q Dash B-O-N. Get it right baby
From the bottom to the ATL
Haa! Decatur, Swat, College Park
Haa! Wynwood, Hialeah, Sawesera!
Liberty City, Carol City, Opa-Locka... this for y'all
Little Haiti, Sao Pa Sai!
All my cubans... Que vola? Que vuelta? Que volon?
Yeah!
