Intro:
It's the Speaker Knockerz


(Verse)
Who you think you playing
Please stop telling these lies
You can't fool these eyes
Fuckin round with all these guys
Girl i'm just saying
I let you count all my dough
I ain't worried bout no ho
Niggas mad cause they broke
And I be ballin'
You can get whatever you like
I swear i ain't even trynna fight
Blocking hoes left and right
Girl, They keep calling
Girl you know you bad
I hate to see you so sad
Let you ride black on black
Cause its nothing
Switching lanes like I change clothes
You flexing on these lame hoes
I guess thats how the game goes, we stuntin
You know you want this dick stop frontin
Give me the call im coming
Sneak in ya house like "brah man"


(Hook)
I really need somebody
So tell me: are you that somebody?

Ion really trust nobody
Girl i gotta watch my back
Cause I'm not just anybody

Ion really trust nobody
Girl i gotta watch my back
Cause I'm not just anybody
So tell me that somebody

Ion really trust nobody
Girl i gotta watch my back
Cause I'm not just anybody
