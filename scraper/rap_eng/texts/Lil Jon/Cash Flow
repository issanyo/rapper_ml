[talking]
Yea , 2004, BraveHeart, uh huh

[Chorus]
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow
Then I fuck a hoe, roll up a smoke, jump in the range rove
Brand new clothes, I got all the hoes, on tha east coast
To tha west coast, yall know how we go
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow

[Verse 1]
I say we got them big guns dat tear yo ass up
How we do thangs, you'll get yo' ass gut
Styrofoam in yo' casket, you lying in tha dust
Yo' pistol packin years wasn't nuttin, see how we hit 'em
To tha body, and the streets so strong
Telling my bitches and my niggas hold on
I know I'm getting high, I fuck a bitch she cry
She hold me so tight never want me to be gone
Now I'm wrong, this Gee Wiz ?
Now you it's him it's me
I'm flossin wit my other half Jungle yall see
So when we step up we waste no time
We flut up ya fans, and take 'em, they mine
I throw a nigga, stomp a nigga BraveHeart style
No set can come close to us, fool, they clowns
The Battle of my ? it go round and round
I turn a stupid ass smile upside down

[Chorus]
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow
Then I fuck a hoe, roll up a smoke, jump in the range rove
Brand new clothes, I got all the hoes, on tha east coast
To tha west coast, yall know how we go
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow

[Verse 2]
Yo' you popin off wit them BraveHearts
Gettin' money son it's all about dat paper
Yea, them bitches want me on top of them
They see them diamonds, they always sparklin
I be ill legal wit dat desert eagle
I hit you all up in yo head in front of yo people
Nigga, I empty out on yo bitch ass
You'll be dead so fast shit push back
Cause life ain't shit but bitches end millions
Good investments like acres and buildings
Lil Shortys in tha hood raisin them children
Baby dad locked up or somebody killed 'em
Fa real yo, it's crazy yo', drama all day yo
My niggas in prison wanna hear me on tha radio
Cause where I'm from yo, life ain't a game yo
Jungle's my name yo, blow wit a fo' fo'

[Chorus]
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow
Then I fuck a hoe, roll up a smoke, jump in the range rove
Brand new clothes, I got all the hoes, on tha east coast
To tha west coast, yall know how we go
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow

[Verse 3]
Yo' the cash must be made
Organized crime, cook up a kilo break it down
To dimes, spread it out in packages ? and ?
Fuck them handcuffs the cops can't touch us
A fourty-five, they got accurate aim
If you ain't in my game take a bullet to tha brain
Shit, nobody cares, life ain't fair
I feel like I was born in an electric chair
Yo' wheres tha jungle, gon' be here for years
Just a stopper through the game like the numba man
In the hood, ? you got ? BraveHeart slam
Step up on tha side my man you don't undastand
I'm from tha QB side of things, things is things but
You know my niggas,yo they let them things ring
And we right, straight right through yall niggas
Snatchin dat paper, & you know we snatch a couple bitches right

[Chorus]
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow
Then I fuck a hoe, roll up a smoke, jump in the range rove
Brand new clothes, I got all the hoes, on tha east coast
To tha west coast, yall know how we go
First a studio, then a video, then we do a show
Count my cash flow
