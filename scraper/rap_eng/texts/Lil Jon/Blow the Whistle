[Verse]

Fling on the beat Wrighty spitting heat
Look how I do this every week you know it’s getting peak
Doesn’t matter any genre the Wrighty batter
I’m smashing their records I’ve seen the competition scatter
The come ups been brutal the day ones all know
I’ve just been patiently waiting, I had to dumb down the flow. They didn’t know that Wrighty be spitting incredible flows
I done all the shows I did all that when you was on roads
When you was doing deets I was rapping and practicing over beats
I been doing this a while but already I made it, I’m new and updated, awards like rated, I’m gunning for everybody, it’s like the prom and I sprayed it
Now highly debated, your snoozing on him, highly sedated
I’m more than every ready, the weight on my shoulders that be to damn heavy
Chasing these jezzies impressing them with blinged out bezzies
I ain’t knocking your fun, but them type of distractions nah go run nah go mek it, watch how I run and go tek it back I’m like Ralph when I wreck it, you better
Put some respect on my name Wrighty ain’t playing games
You’ve been trying to link the plug I’m the fucking mains

[Chorus]

Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Call me money may coz I’m worth 100 million

[Verse]

Deep down I know they wishing I left
I got no reason to be stressed I be feeling so blessed
Effortless, no contest, nevertheless, I’m born to impress, I see you favourite rapper wearing a dress
It’s all nuts fam, rappers acting funny now they’re getting money
I got the hunger like the Wrighty’s still bummy
You think that any amount of money can take this hunger from from, nah you’re lost, P45 I’m your new boss
I’m ready to drop a classic on this game, just know I’m not playing
I heard your EP but what was you saying, nothing
That be pushing my buttons, your talent saying nothing, what you doing for society, all you rappers fronting
How many new watches and bezels can a brudda get?
When you mum be catching busses and your fam in debt?
That shit right there I find incredible bro, recognise there’s more to Wrighty than incredible flows, yo

[Chorus]

Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Call me money may coz I’m worth 100 million

Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Blow the whistle
Fights done were killing em
Call me money may coz I’m worth 100 million
