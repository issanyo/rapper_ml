[Verse]
I bust the block for the sack I guess y’all still ain’t learning
Them Dale boys playing the corner just like Richard Sherman
Opinions I'm un-concerning
From lil Peewee Herman’s
Bitch I keep my ends tights im the '06 Vernon
Hopped out the pan so greasy dread edge still frying
Teez and Dey Dey still click but we must rewind
UAPB out spit Teezy mascot, he lying
Like snap no cap my streak still not dying
Them blue strips on my hip
Like I'm banging the 6
These little porn star niggas only banging they lips
Niggas get a little change and start making less sense
Ain't no nigga took my chips and was able to dip
You to need slim ya mouth down you '08 Ky Jenner
Ya keep talking 'bout ya plate until we take yo dinner
May baby heart cold like I was on born in December
No scars but AR's for those that lurk on a nigga
Won't let the pride get me popped I'm a street smart Simba
D. Brown at church got hits like I bang them cymbals
D. Brown on field torch a nigga he can eat my ember
Mean what I say say what I mean you timid I'm tenor
My metal like to talk a lot I named that bitch bender
New bitch bad ass fat waste more slimmer
She sweet so sweet diabete no Splenda
And she handle wood good she never get no splinters
Came out the sewer dodged some shells I still ain't turn splinter
Done seen cells turn the worst sinners into repenters
Done seen niggas go free under snitching conditions
Done seen my closet niggas all fall victim to system
That shit remind me fly straight I can't get jet lag
Walmart ass niggas tryna check my bag
I ain't really just the type to do the boasting and brag
But I done lapped y'all so much the whole race on lag
Pass the stick pussy nigga only time you magic
I done scoped the whole game I could jug John Madden
Still sleeping on carpets till I'm fly like Aladdin
All this shit by choice see its part of my tactic
But that's all that I'm say cause it ain't like they could step me
Niggas watch how you spilling tryna repeat the recipe
But fuck this I'm done preaching all y'all capping still stressing me
Cop some carrots for my ear and stuff my dutch full of celery
Damn!
