I was walking through the crowd and i seen her with her team i tapped her on the shoulder and said girl i like them jeans

I told her,go shorty shorty go, shorty shorty go!
Ahh goooooo, go shorty shorty go, shorty shorty go

She was dancing like a stripper so i had to throw some ones
She winked her eye at me and said its time to have some fun
I told her,go shorty shorty go, shorty shorty go!
Ahh goooooo, go shorty shorty go, shorty shorty go

(verse 1)
Hopped off the stage
Walked through the crowd
Drunker than a white boy
Blowin on that loud
Shorty said something
But the music was too loud

I told her come here
Girl get out this crowd

And uhh

Come fu*k with my team
Tell the waitress 4 bottles of goose and 30 wings
And now she all up on me wisperin these dirty things

Lip ring tongue ring, girl you a freak
Wink a eye at me and said bring quez and li
