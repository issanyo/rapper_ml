[Intro: Freeway]
Special wear got it made ‘cause we super paid
Maybach outside that’s a super ride
Cause of homicide hit y'all with the super gauge
They ride our way ‘cause we superfly
I’m ‘bout to raise the prices I swear to god
ROC y'all know how we ride
Bangladesh, CyHi, Lil Jon
Let's go

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
What the fuck bitch
Rep your mother fucking click hey
What the fuck bitch
Rep your mother fucking click hey
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit

[Verse 1: Freeway]
I'm on the streets of North Philly tryna get me some smoker
The hood filled with them vultures that’s why I roll with the semi You know my repertoire get the words from Dakota my man
Dacota Dacia give my respect to Beanie
Get cut get shaved give a cut to Beanie
Half the hood wanna merk me the other half wanna be
The boss, I floss, if a boy run up on 'em
Put some flowers up on ‘em and send ‘em straight to the coroner
Say bruh I'm tourin' while ya'll niggas in the way bruh
Sold a lot of yola emperor Hova down the way bruh
Trappin’ on the corner Motorola and the pay phone
Now it’s multi-millionaire neighbours where I stay bruh
Yeah I’m eating but I’m starving got a tapeworm
Pray that my name in your mouth fuck up your taste buds
Took me to the nation and they showed me where the safe was
No hesitation always repping where I stay bruh

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
What the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
What the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit

[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
CyHi I’m a Eastside boy
We rather meet up, before we let the beef slide boy
Ha, had a Caprice on [?]
Back when they used to ask me what I sell a 3.5 for
I’m from Atlanta don’t ask me what I’m wearing FILA’s for
I’m with a Magic City and a V Live whore
Pull up in the Chevy bought the T-Top Ford
Drive by’s is the only time that we drive fours
My niggas in the club doin’ sign language
Wrinkled faces with the bracelet let the iron [?]
Plus I got more hoes than the fire station
Violate it it's a ticket on your head that’s a citation

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
Let’s go, what the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
What the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit
What the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
What the fuck bitch, rep your mother fucking click hey
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit (fuck 'em)
Fuck them pussy niggas that ain't repping they shit
