[Hook x16
GO BIG MOMMA!, go ahead, go ahead

[Verse 1]
Uh, uh, uh, uh ooh, ah let's begin
Big Momma comin' through better tell your friends
What that South like
That good country cookin' all day and night
She might be big but she can still go
To the dance flo' to the back of our co'
Hey, don't talk no junk
Ya might get skunked with a mother gun, huh
If ya wanna fight
Big Momma knock ya out with one aight
It's all to the good
Cause nobody watchin' over our neighborhood
But wait a minute
I came to get with Sherry or Bennett
Cause she so cute
And I love it when she wear them Daisy Dukes

[Hook x16]
GO BIG MOMMA!, go ahead, go ahead

[Verse 2]
I was at a jam the other night
Seen Big Momma, she was lookin' tight
Iced out, grill in her mouth
Flake in her hair, representin' that South
On the floor she was shakin' that thang
Poppin' that thang, damn, twerkin' that thang
Big Momma off the chain
She will show ya know shame cause she true to the game
And ya know she serious
And the way she bounce got a playa delirious
And I know she ready
Gotta dance so crunk even though she heafty
And when we left the club
I seen Big Momma's Caddy sittin' on them dubs
And the trunk with the block beater
I was sittin' right behind her in the two-seater

[Hook x16]
GO BIG MOMMA!, what, what

[Verse 3]
Ooh look at Big Momma, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma droppin' that thang, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma big and beautiful, OOH BIG MAMA!
Look at Big Momma with them Daisy Dukes, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma got on some jammies, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma what chu' talkin' bout, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma done gone off the top, OOH BIG MAMA!
Big Momma you scare me, OOH BIG MAMA!

[Hook x16]
GO BIG MOMMA!, go ahead, go ahead

GO AHEAD! (Repeated to fade)
