(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Project Pat-ah
Pistol pack-ah
Skull crack-ah
In the V.I.P, buyin' Goose like a trap-ah
Green smoke-ah
Purple Kush blunt roll-ah
Always needin' change, I'm a big-face fold-ah
Dope holdin'
Fourty-four is enforcin'
A punk tried me once
Flippin' baileys like a horse-man
What'cha lookin' at boy? As I'm walkin' by
In the club, in my face
Bout to blow my high
Pop the pill
While you muggin, I'm groovin
'Less you wanna die
My nigga, keep it movin'
Cause we shoot first
And ask questions la-terrr
Have ya skull leakin'
Like a busted tomat-errr

(Hook)

(Verse 2, Juicy J)
Err'body in my clique, we dra-a-ank
Err'body in my clique, got ba-a-ank
Err'body in my clique, we ba-a-all
Gold teeth niggas comin' straight from North No-o-orth
"Everyday We Hustlin", just like Rick Ro-o-oss
Err'day we strugglin, and err'day we sno-o-ort
These niggas can't fuck wit' my hood, we de-e-eep
The last thing ya see, is the bottom of my fe-e-eet

(DJ Paul)
Now let the fame begin
I'm born and bred off in the City of Sin
The dirty dime, whoadi, Memphis Ten
When my niggas get dough
Stuff the white up they nose
Take the kush, break down
Sprinkle in Cigarillos
When my homies ride high, wit' the bump
Err-eh, bad sometimes might ride wit' a body, err-eh
Back, then we clinged in the club
Outside ain't jokin'
In the parkin' lot, outcomes, what'cha smokin?

(Hook)
