[Intro: Lil Jon]
Dance, dance
(Dj Felli Fel!)
Let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, if it's your birthday tonight
You need to get your fucking drinks up
And get ready to motherfucking hard

[Hook: Jessie Malakouti]
It's your birthday bitch, let me see you dance
It's your birthday bitch, let me see you dance
It's your birthday bitch, let me see you dance
It's your birthday bitch, let me see you dance

[Bridge: Dj Felli Fel]
Party people put your hands in the air right now
Party people put your hands in the air right now
Party people put your hands in the air right now
Party people put your hands in the air, air

[Hook: Jessie Malakouti]

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday bitch, it's your birthday
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
It's your birthday bitch, it's your birthday
Now right now we need to see
Who the fuck is in the club tonight!
