[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Where my niggas, where my niggas?
Man-man my niggas so ruthless
Leave a nigga in the club toothless
See I run up out the booth less
[?]
Gang shit, my haters they weak as shit
Even out of town we on Memphis shit
Nigga [?] you gon' witness it
I wild a nigga with a .45
Nigga better run for their lives
Why people actin' so surprised?
They finna [?], we live
All up in the club gettin' buck with all my guys
Smokin' on the dance floor like dude we super high
Crashin' through the crowd we moshin' try'na get by
Pushin' niggas to the floor, stampedes, somebody gon' die

[Hook x2: Lil Jon]
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move motherfucker!
Bitch move motherfucker!

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I am the Infamous relentless, bitch I break down your dimension
You wanna test my pimpin'? Gorilla militant villain
Chinchilla ... china white straight to the (?)

South Memphis guard, trick I rip out yo damn heart
Send niggas ... takin' the charge to do the job
Nigga you ain't got no spine, don't make me burn you with this iron
Bitch I'm out ma fuckin' mind, I torture you and take my time

[Hook x2: Lil Jon]
Bitch move! Bitch move!
Bitch move! Bitch move!

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
No bullshit goin' down on my watch, I shake the game up like hockey
Executors makin' (?) they play with the money, becomin' a hostage
I jump it off like a moshpit, nigga better cover his head like an ostrich
I get on some mob shit, fuck with my profits ... them pockets
Hot shit when I keep toppin' rockin', Mafia 6ix - Bone ain't stoppin'
It's better when I get to the problem ... problem solver
I got ... I am with only ballers
These (?) never (?) all because they can't afford it
