I am trying, to be alive
The only thing that matters to me
Is cake
The cake on the rooftop
Smells like cigar
Only the one that you ate
Is the car

I love cake
Cake is me
Cake is love
Love is you and me plus cake
Heal the cake
Free the world
Free yourselves
Don't remorse

When i left
I was sad
She was dying
On the porch
I said yo momma
Is so fat
She smells
Like a horse

I love cake
Cake is me
Cake is love
Love is you and me plus cake
Heal the cake
Free the world
Free yourselves
Don't remorse

The cake is clean
No guns allowed
When you set me free
I am afraid of sprouts
So dont know my name
When i eat you out
Because the pussy's good
Imma fuck her another time
