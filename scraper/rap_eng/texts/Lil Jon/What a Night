[Chorus: Claude Kelly]
I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone when
I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls
They were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

[Verse 1: Lil' Jon]
Feels so good (so good)
Feels so right (so right)
Let's make a toast (make a toast)
To the night (to the night)
It's gonna get crazy (crazy)
So hold on tight (on tight)
Let's have a ball (ball)
Live your life (life)
Let it go (let it go)
Let it loose (let it loose)
Release it all (release it all)
No excuse (cuse)
Have no cares (no cares)
Have no fears (have no fears)
Let's act a fool (act a fool)
Up in here (hey)

[Chorus: Claude Kelly & Lil' Jon]
I was lost (lost)
I was frozen (frozen)
Walking down the streets alone when (yeah)
I saw this place was open (what), tonight (hey hey hey )
And the girls (girls)
They were rocking (rocking)
And the alcohol was flowing (yeah)
And I knew right away this was my life

[Post Chorus: Lil Jon & Claude Kelly]
Put your f*ing hands up
Oh what a night
Night
Night
Night
Night
Night
Night
Night
Night

[Bridge: Lil Jon]
A lot of smoking
A lot of drinking
A lot of singing
A lot of dancing
A lot of freaking
A lot of women
A lot of kissing
A lot of sinning

[Chorus: Claude Kelly]
I was lost
I was frozen
Walking down the streets alone when
I saw this place was open, tonight
And the girls
They were rocking
And the alcohol was flowing
And I knew right away this was my life
Oh what a night
Oh what a night
Oh what a night

Lil Jon

What a night

Claude Kelly
Night
