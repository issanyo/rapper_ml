And I just want these busters to know that pimps don't die out

And some motherf**kin' dividends
So all you bitch ass niggas can RIP
In case you niggas didn't know that means Rest In motherf**kin' Piss
Suck ass niggas

The telebine gonna get these niggas f**ked Pimpin Ken, man
I'm talkin' 'bout man Pimpin Ken still squeezin'

Gettin in
Still smackin' like lightning, you understand?
And beatin' every mother f**kin' endightment
Yeah nigga you can't kill me nigga
Our I'll kill you like Martin
You bitch ass niggas!
