[Chyna Whyte]
Chyna Whyte don't suck no dicks or lick no nuts
Bitch I hit licks and flip bricks
Every two hours switch whips to keep the peoples off me
What you know about that No Doze and coffee
No sleep, I 'm lookin' 40
With three bricks in a 740
Bitch I ain't got time to party
I'm breakin' bread with Dominican niggas
Over a hot Benigan's dinner
Thinkin' how I'ma cop the 6 at the beginnin' of winter
Chrome it out and then fit it with timber, that's wood grain
What you ain't know, this a hood thang
All my thugs let ya wood swang
Bitches make ya ass clap
I'm takin' all y'all ASCAP and BMI
Catch me drivin' DUI
Look cause I don't give a fuck nigga I'm livin' or die
Who on this track fuckin' with me, y'all is willin' to try
Chyna Whyte the thug bitch with no feelin's inside
Motherfucka

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Well pour out the Henn and Coke and fire up that dro'
It's Ludacris off Old National and Godby Road
The block is sold
Clear then I shot the globe
I clock the hoes, lock do's and drop the bows
I rock the shows
Pop, lock, and knock yo nose
You Bia Bia, I grab my .44 and mob the flo'
I mop and glow
The Feds tryin' to stop my dough
They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain
Cock back and swing the thang
Yo girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her - I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaasty
Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes were dazed
I was in the zone, coulda thrown up them tre's
And if you lost, Lil' Jon's got some Eastside ways
So stop actin' like a Bia if yo ass ain't blaze

[Hook]

[Too $hort]
Bitch niggas in the house tell me what's up
A nigga slapped you in the mouth and told you shut up
Somebody holler get 'em and now you just a victim
Shorty tried to stick 'em, told the pit bull to sick 'em
I know he wanna run but he can't he assed out
Punched him in his chin and then he passed out
Woke up with his pockets turned inside-out
Always hit them weak motherfuckaz right in they mouth
You better stay out the way and act like you ain't havin' shit
Cause niggas will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you
You'd be a damn fool to act like you ballin' dude
Mindin' yo business, they grabbed you by yo collar
You feel like Marvin Gaye cause they make you wanna holler
But since you can't run, you might as well fight
Quit actin' like a bitch and live a real life
You just a Bia Bia
