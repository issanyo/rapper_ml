[Intro: Lil' Jon & Jadakiss]
Yeah (yeah) OK (ok) motherfucker (motherfucker)
Y'all know who it is (who is it?)
Lil' Jon, them motherfuckin' East Side Booooyz (yeah, yeah)
I got my nigga Jadakiss with me too (D-Block, live son)
We gon' do this for all the real motherfuckin' niggas
(Uh uh uh uh yo)
Holla at them niggas J, come on

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yeah, Kiss name known, matter fact, Kiss name blown
And bitches always wanna hit me like I just came home
But I still put the tools in ya mouth
Niggas know that I'm a monster on the East, but I'm huge in the South
This is evil in the trenches and everybody starvin'
So to get the money right we put the deisel on the benches
"Down Bottom" feel like the ol' days
Fuckin' with the corn liquor ridin' around listen to O'Jays
When we loadin' the clip every slug gotta catch
When you goin' to war every thug got his match
SS baby-blue Impala with the mack in it
Big gold cup with rhinestones with my pack in it
It's like the jungle but the broads is fine
And if they ain't puffin' crippie, then this Georgia fine
Listen, I'm the wrong nigga to style with
My motherfuckin' problem to reconcile with
Nigga what

[Chorus: Lil Jon]
We knockin' heads off, yeah

[Bridge: Lil' Jon]
Yeah, BME ho, we up out this bitch
Ruff Ryders ho, what's up
But before we leave
I gotta let my nigga tell you his name

[Verse 4: Styles]
I'm Holiday Styles, where the fuck you thuggin' at
I knock off ya head with a Louisville Slugger bat
P'll go to war and ain't never have to bring a nigga
My gun is armed and my bullets like a finger nigga
Call up Lil' Jon and them East Side Boyz
All I need is a lil' bomb and them East Side toys
You can catch me in the Dirty South, I got a dirty mouth
Sittin' on the roof with the fuckin' 30-30's out
I told you I'm a menace y'all
I got enough guns to fill up the Lennox Mall
In the front parking lot, coke still movin' good
Guns still sparke a lot
Hustlin' with family, partyin' with murderers
D-Block and everything, shit you probably heard of us
Yeah I'm a Ryder nigga, you ain't got a gun
Or a motherfuckin' knife, you ain't even gon' try us
I'll leave you with a hole daddy
And for the fact that I'm in the Dirty South
I'll be bouncin' in the old Caddy
What - motherfucker
