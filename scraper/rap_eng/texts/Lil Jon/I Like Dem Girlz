[Chorus]
It's some hoes in this house
It's some hoes in this house
If you see them point them out
If you see them point them out
It's some hoes in this house
It's some hoes in this house
If you see them point them out
If you see them point them out

[Verse 1]
I like them hoes with them golds in they mouth
That be them hoes from the motherfuckin' south
I like them hoes with them big ass butts
That be them hoes that'll let a nigga cut
I like them hoes with them tats on they thigh
That be them hoes that love to get high
I like them hoes with them piercings in they tongue
That be them hoes that suck dick and swallow cum

[Chorus]
I like them hoes (where them hoes at? Where them hoes at?)
I like them hoes (where them hoes at? Where them hoes at?)
I like them hoes (wassup? Wassup? Wassup?)
I like them hoes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I like them hoes (I like them hoes)
I like them hoes (I like them hoes)
I like them hoes (wassup? Wassup? Wassup?)
I like them hoes (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Some call them hoochies
Some call them breezys
Some call them bitches
But we call them hoes
That's how it goes

[Verse 2]
I like them hoes with them colored ass wigs
That be them hoes with two or more kids
I like them hoes that'll help a nigga fight
That be them hoes that'll fuck with a dyke
I like them hoes with they own damn car
That be them hoes down for menage a trois
I like them hoes with them six inch heels
That be them hoes that'll let a nigga drill

[Chorus]
I like them hoes (where them hoes at? Where them hoes at?)
I like them hoes (where them hoes at? Where them hoes at?)
I like them hoes (wassup? Wassup? Wassup?)
I like them hoes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I like them hoes (I like them hoes)
I like them hoes (I like them hoes)
I like them hoes (wassup? Wassup? Wassup?)
I like them hoes (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
I like them hoes with them diamonds in they nails
That be them hoes that ain't scared to go to jail
I like them hoes with that weave in the front
That be them hoes that can roll a fat blunt
I like them hoes with them tight capri pants
That be them hoes that put you in a three point stance
I like them hoes that be tooting that dust
That be them hoes that don't really give a fuck

[Chorus]
I like them hoes (get right on now)
Said right on now (get right on now)
Just right on now (get right on now)
Just right on now (get right on now)
