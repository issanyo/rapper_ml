[Chorus: Oobie]
Get Yo Ass on the floor
Girl you betta (stop, stop playin)
Bitch what u waitn for get yo ass on the floor

[Verse 1]
You know that night was good
When you wake up in the mornin with that cloudy piss
You know how i do work
Give me the Vodka skip the Criss
I'm at the bar feelin 50 takin bout 9 shots
I got like 9 broads takin them with me, why stop?
Now I'm bouncin from broad to broad
My thang be thick from wall to wall
I've read the book but its like i mastered the art of war
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage cuz i had a couple of drinks
Think again, I'll have you like Kanye West with a brand new jaw and a metal chin

[Chorus: Oobie]
Get Yo Ass on the floor
Girl you betta (stop, stop playin)
Bitch what u waitn for get yo ass on the floor

[Verse 2]
Excuse me, I'm takin over
I'm sick like ebola
I don't know what they told ya
But bitch this chicos a solja
Get the cripp and roll up or drop the E and roll out
Most of these bustas fold up when its time to thug out
Ima take it to the club where them freaks be takin it off and backin it up
Ima make it so hot that when these mamis walk in they ready to fuck
Every (every)
Body(body)
Listen (listen)
Closely cuz ima do what has never been done
The games been fucked but it's never been sprung

[Chorus: Oobie]
Get Yo Ass on the floor
Girl you betta (stop, stop playin)
Bitch what u waitn for get yo ass on the floor
