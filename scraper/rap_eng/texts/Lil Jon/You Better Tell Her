If I'm believing what I hear is true
(Oh)
Then there's a broad 'round town that's claiming you
(Okay)
And listen, daddy I'm too cute to fight
You better get that bitch told tonight

And I don't ever, I mean never, ever, ever
Wanna deal with this again, hey
You better tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her

I don't give a damn what's real, what's fake
What's truth, what's lies
See darling I don't feel it's relevant to me

I don't wanna know her name, where you met
If she's some crazy chick just stalkin' you
I don't care it's irrelevant to me
(Pissed off as I am)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was saucy at the bar looking like a star
When she got off in my face
Talkin' 'bout what you do when you do it to her
I damn near slapped her face
Okay, she don't know me, better ask someone
I don't play those silly chicken games, oh no

[Chorus]
If I'm believing what I hear is true
(Oh)
Then there's a broad 'round town that's claiming you
(Okay)
And listen, daddy I'm too cute to fight
You better get that bitch told tonight
And I don't ever; I mean never, ever, ever
Wanna deal with this again, hey
You better tell her, tell her, tell her, tell her

If in fact you gave her your thing, it doesn't matter babe
I know her touch don't feel like mine
(I know her touch don't feel like mine, get it right)

If in fact you gave her a little change, doesn't matter
'Cause I know whose names on the account
(I get mine not matter what the price)
Ooh this is how it all went down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x 5]
