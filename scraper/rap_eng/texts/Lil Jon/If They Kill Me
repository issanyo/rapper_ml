[Hook]
If they kill me
They best to be ready to move[3x]
Cause my folks coming back
My nigga to kill you
[2x]

[Verse 1]
This is a song for
Them niggas talkin' bout killin' me
Something to listen to
Before I go on my killing spree
Y'all niggas ain't shit to me
A bunch of followers
And when I catch your ass
I'mma swallow ya
Bitch I'mma bury ya
The mo' the merrier
I pray you out with your niggas
They can carry ya
Pit bull terrier, fightin' the Pekinese
You wanna crank up your war
Bitch come fuck with me
I got some real g's and then some g's that
I teach them niggas
And lay low off in cacilac
Off in the Cadillac, 2002 edition
It's Pastor Troy, fuck boy
And your benediction
It ain't no contradiction
You walkin' thin ice
You put your money down monkey nigga
Now roll the dice
Claim he gone take my life
I got the trick for ya
I got a 45 hard as a dick for ya
You kill me

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2]
These niggas plottin', prayin
Cryin' they hoes
Don't hate me, my nigga I'm chose
Those, suckas and bustas don't like it when you gloat
The same bitch you crying to
I fucked the ho
Uh-oh you didn't know
That she was buck wild
Strong possibility that that may be my child
Look at you now you feelin real fuckin short
Now keep on bustin your ass for child support (dumb ass
Nigga)
I'm at the fort
Eating steak and liftin weights
Nice ass crib five cars I'm straight
But on the other hand
Look at you little man
Grindin' ten years
Barely got a grand
And, you talkin bout killin a man of God
You gone bust hell wide open hot rod
I'ma, represent D.S.G.B
And kill any nigga
With plans of killin me

[Chorus 4x]
