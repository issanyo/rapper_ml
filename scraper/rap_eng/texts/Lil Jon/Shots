"I'm fucked up!"

If you not drunk ladies and gentlemen
Get ready to get fucked up
Let's do it, Ha Ha
Hey!

When I walk in the club all eyes on me
I'm with the Party Rock crew, all drinks are free
We like Cîroc, we love Patrón
We came to party rock, everybody it's on

Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots

Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots

Everybody

If you ain't getting drunk get the fuck out the club
If you ain't taking shots, also get the fuck out the club

The ladies love us when we pour shots
They need an excuse to suck our cocks
We came to get crunk how 'bout you?
"Bottoms up," let's go round two

Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots
Shots shots shots shots shots

Everybody!

"I'm fucked up!"
"I'm fucked up!"
"I'm fucked up!"
"I'm tryna fuck!"
"I'm tryna fuck!"
