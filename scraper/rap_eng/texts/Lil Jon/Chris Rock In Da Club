[Chris Rock]
Yo what's up, this is Chris Rock
And I'm wit my man Lil Jon
And we stay in da club
We live in da club
We die in da club
We get our car washed in da club
We go to school in da club
We go to da cleaners in da club
We never leave da motherfuckin' club!
We go to church in da club!
We do everything in the motherfuckin' club!
We pay our taxes in da club!
We go to the library in da club!
