[Chorus: Tah-G (Lil Jon)]
F that ish, we love that peanut butter (What?)
Put it on my apples and bread (What? What?)
You know I love that peanut butter (What?)
I don't mess with no jam (What? What?)
For real

[Verse 1: Swiss Miss (Tah-G)]
Peanut butter everywhere like it's my money
Spread it on the bread cause that's funny
Add a little jam now you got a honey
(F that ish we love that peanut butter)
Speaking out real loud now boy
Peanut butter gives me that real joy
My girl's hotter than the Helen of Troy
(F that ish we love that peanut butter)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Damorealizer (Tah-G)]
Spread the peanut butter on the bread
Skip the jelly I ain't need no red
Eating that shit like Nicki with the stu-tu-tu-ter
(F that ish we love that peanut butter)
Chunky, smooth, all of the above
Eating that butter like a baseball glove
Almond butter? Coconut butter?
(F that ish we love that peanut butter)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tah-G]
I'll be peanut butter cause I made it from the gutter
Nice on the mic, boy I'll never ever stutter
Gotta wear the J the OKC thunder
F that ish we love that peanut butter
With my steak I prefer blue cheese
Always looking fresh on my Capital Steeze
Passed away too early man, R.I.P
F that ish we love that peanut butter

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tah-G]
Hit me with that smooth, I don't want no clutters
I'm smooth on the mic, yeah I never mutter
I be straight chilling playing golf on the putter
F that ish we love that peanut butter
