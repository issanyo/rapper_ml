[Intro: Kandi Girl]
Ooh, you want this kitty don't you?
You know she wants you too
But you gotta do one thing first
I need you to kiss it

[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
See me, all I wanna do is get in your draws
Hit it from the back, while ya ass hit pause
Mr. Funkadelic off deep in ya jaws
I love the way you lick it up on the sidewalls
Open up wide, let me slide on in
Drinkin' on this gin make a nigga wanna sin
The orgy begins, now she lickin' on the tip
Might as well be a tip drill the way ya tongue flippin'
You need to get a girl and stop bullshittin'
Spur tongue girl like a snow white kitten, listen!
Get up on the bed and give me head
While I sit back and watch you go fed
You got me on hard, wit my toes on curl
Fuck faces from the other side of the world
Skeet, skeet, skeet in ya mouth, it's like that
While your ass tooted up and I eat it from the back

[Hook: Kandi Girl]
Baby eat it up, eat it up, eat it up, eat it up
If I gotta give you what you like
First you gotta give me what I like
Then beat it up, beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
If you rub this cat just right
Then I'll give it to you good all night
Beat it up!

[Verse 2: Don P]
Yeah!
Its goin' down tonight, "Crunk Juice" got me feelin' right!
I only do 68's, I owe ya one, no 69's
When she on top, ridin' it fast
It's only right that I grab that ass
Then pull her hair, when I turn her over, and hit it from the back
Ain't nothin' like getting with a big chula to give dome (yeah!)
And after that, I ain't in that group, but you know I'm gon' bone
Eat it up! Not yet
Matter of fact, I gotta lesbian for that
Whatchu' know 'bout the "bedroom crunk"
2 girls knockin' at my door 'bout threesome

[Hook: Kandi Girl]
Baby eat it up, eat it up, eat it up, eat it up
If I gotta give you what you like
First you gotta give me what I like
Then beat it up, beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
If you rub this cat just right
Then I'll give it to you good all night
Beat it up!

[Verse 3: Lil Atlanta]
This how it's goin' down, I'mma hit all night
Ain't nothin' to talk about, plus if I head right
Sike! We ain't gotta talk about that
See it's 4 in the morning, let me hit it from the back
I'ma smack it, shack it, bulldog-attack it
Have fun, what you do, just like practice
You gotta give it to me how I like it, I'm straight
You want me to do what? Look shawty, I just ate
Wait! How many inches can you take?
Tastes like candy, doors closed, can you stay?
Say how you need it and I'mma beat it
When I'm pullin' on ya hair, got me really wanna skeet it
Getting heated up here 'cause that ass so hot in here
Where ya goin'? Quit runnin', come here
You love the things that I do? Same here
Ayeeee!

[Hook: Kandi Girl]
Baby eat it up, eat it up, eat it up, eat it up
If I gotta give you what you like
First you gotta give me what I like
Then beat it up, beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
If you rub this cat just right
Then I'll give it to you good all night
Beat it up!

[Bridge: Kandi Girl & Cutty]
I know you really wanna hit it first
But I need you to kiss it first
Baby it's mo' betta'
When you get it mo' wetta'
Don't try to run away
Take all of me
I won't run
I just love the look in your eyes
When you swallow me
You need to lick, lick, licky
On my kitty, kitty, kitty
Get a close look, don't my cat look pretty?
Tastes like candy and it feels real sticky
Follow my rules if you wanna get with me
Okay, now you're my freak
No missionary ways
I'll beat that pussy up and cum in your face

[Hook: Kandi Girl]
Baby eat it up, eat it up, eat it up, eat it up
If I gotta give you what you like
First you gotta give me what I like
Then beat it up, beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
If you rub this cat just right
Then I'll give it to you good all night
Beat it up!

[Outro: Don P]
Yeah, haha, it's your boy Don P right
I mean, you call it 69, right?
Nah, I'mma call it more like 68, I owe you one!
Haha, holla back!
