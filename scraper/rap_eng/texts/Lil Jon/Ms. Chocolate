[Intro: R. Kelly (Lil Jon)]
(YEAH!)
Aye, uh huh (let's go, ladies!)
Uh huh
Lil Jon (yeah!)
Your boy Kells (yeah!)
This is for the Chocolate girls, all around the world (let's go)
Uh, every block (yeah!), every club (yeah!), every hood (YEAH!), I'm in love

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
So sweet, so round, so thick
So nasty ooh I love that shit
So smooth, so creamy
Goddamn it I must be dreaming
So jiggly, so soft
Goddamn it I wanna break you off
So hot you 'gon melt
Eat you all up by myself
Girl I can't wait to unwrap ya
It's a chocolate fix I'm after
So tasty, my treat
Miss Chocolate let me get a little piece
I'm cuckoo for cocoa
So good I want me some more
I'm caught up
I need to stop it
Goddamn I love you Miss Chocolate!

[Hook: Mario]
Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
Independent, this is y'alls anthem
I like them light skinned girls, but that dark skin I love
Chocolate girls stand up, this is y'alls anthem

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Talking about hips
Talking about thighs
Talking about big ol' booties and brown eyes
Chocolate, that's what I gotta have tonight
Leave up out the club with two tonight
Take shots then more shots
Then we drink like we own the bar
And she's pushing that all on me
Conversation like let's just leave
And I don't hesitate (No)
To the crib right away
She dropping it, dropping it
That chocolate, chocolate

[Hook: Mario]
Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
Independent, this is y'alls anthem
I like them light skinned girls, but that dark skin I love
Chocolate girls stand up, this is y'alls anthem

[Verse 3: Mario]
Had a red bone chick before
She don't do it like you do
So I know what I want tonight
Fly, on a chocolate high
Baby girl, you're thick in all the right places
Let me lick that chocolate baby I wanna taste it
Think I'm in love (with your dark skin)
Said I'm in love with Miss Chocolate!

[Hook: Mario]
Talking to my silky smooth, dark skin, chocolate, women
Independent, this is y'alls anthem
I like them light skinned girls, but that dark skin I love
Chocolate girls stand up, this is y'alls anthem

[Outro: R. Kelly (Mario)]
Oh, I gotta have that dark chocolate
(Can you give it to me, give it to me?)
Tonight, I wanna taste (oh yeah) that dark chocolate
(Can you give it to me, give it to me?)
In my bed I gotta have (Ooh give it to me, give it to me) that dark chocolate
Oh, oh (aye)
Oh, oh
Let me hear the chocolate ladies say
Aye yo!
(Aye yo...)
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay yay
Aye yo!
(Aye yooo oh)
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay [echo]
This is y'alls anthem
