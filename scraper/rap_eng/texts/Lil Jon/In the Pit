[Verse 1]
Ok, it's about to go down in this bitch right now
I need everybody to listen motherfuckin' closely
And do exactly what I say

[Pre-Drop]
Make a motherfuckin' big-ass circle
Everybody in this bitch, spread the fuck out
Make a motherfuckin' big-ass circle
Everybody in this bitch, spread the fuck out
Fuck out, fuck out, fuck out, fuck out
Fuck out, fuck out, fuck out, fuck out
Now act a goddamn fool

[Drop]
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit

[Verse 2]
Hold on, hold on
Everybody calm the fuck down
Y'all too motherfuckin' turnt up in here
Everybody back the fuck up, back up
I hope y'all ready for round motherfuckin' two
If you was lit on the first round
Get even more lit on this motherfuckin' second round

[Pre-Drop]
Make a motherfuckin' big-ass circle
Everybody in this bitch, spread the fuck out
Make a motherfuckin' big-ass circle
Everybody in this bitch, spread the fuck out
Fuck out, fuck out, fuck out, fuck out
Fuck out, fuck out, fuck out, fuck out
Now act a goddamn fool

[Drop]
Push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker in the pit
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker
Push a motherfucker, push a motherfucker
