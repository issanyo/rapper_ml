[Intro: Katt Williams]
Ladies and Pimps and Haters of all ages
All low selfesteem women please leave the dance floor
Expaditiously if not sooner. This is for the cocky bitches. Lil John!

[Lil Jon]
Yeaaaaaaah!

[Hook:Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
Sweat ya perm out ladies, sweat ya perm out
Sweat your perm out momma
Sweat ya perm out, sick of drama baby momma
Sweat your fucking perm out
Sweat your fucking perm out, sweat your fucking perm out

It's ya boy Lil John right
My nigga Kat Williams in this bitch
Now ladies! If you got on the brand new Juicy Couture
And you looking good let's go!

[Chorus: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Verse 1: Katt Williams]
I like light skin girls, extra points for dimples
Smooth dark complexion, no sign of pimples
I like midnight women, when their teeth is white
I like old little ladies when my cheese ain't ripe
I like amazon bitches, that's about 6'3
Cause I love it when the pussy eye to eye with me
Where my big girls at? Where my big girls?
Big momma she can take, she a big girl
I like suburb bitches, culdasac bitches
Project, supahead, cadillac bitches
Simalac bitches, keepagat bitches
Packastack, crackajack ladymack bitches
Diamond chain, pinky ring
Birdgang bitches, own house
Own car, do ya' own thang bitches
Stay fresh, Dipset, gangbang bitches. La, va, ga bitches

[Chorus:Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
Btg broad, and a no given boost
Outta btg jeans, no kiddin' shorty is cute
Let us sit up in the coope
Baby I'm gettin' checks like the symbol on my shoe
Yeah, the symbol of the swoosh
Got the stones lookin' colorful
Resemblin' some fruit, apples
Bananas, watermelon, berryblue
I could have ya takin' trips
Doin' shit she never do. No more comin' out ya building
Now you steppin' on ya stoop
I just flex a little loot if I think I wanna keep her
All around the neck, like I got it in the sleeper
But shorty, she a diva. Look
I'm a take ya out, spend some money
Hit some skins the first night
Then I'm a leave her. I'm hard up on a skeezer
Beside that if I can get no money outta pockets
I'm a get it outta visa. Hell yeah
I g-uh. I treat her like the teachers do
The students and a teacher. Fat booty, I'm a beat it

[Hook: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
Sweat ya perm out ladies, sweat ya perm out
Sweat your perm out momma
Sweat ya perm out, sick of drama baby momma
Sweat your fucking perm out
Sweat your fucking perm out, sweat your fucking perm out

[Chorus: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]

Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Verse 3: Lil Jon]
My name begins with P, and ends with P
Everything in between they call it the T
Matter of fact why don't you call me a G?
If I touch it on your ass I'm a do it for free
My shawty ass fat, just like eight ball stomach
I don't care how fat it is
I still want it! Take a picture of it
That's a kodak moment! If Katt like your ass
Baby girl I love it! I'm in the club
We can do it in public. If you won't pay for the dick
Then you gets nothing. I'm a pimp
Yuh my momma taught me. You can give a bitch clothes
But don't give her money. All she want is some dick
Cause she know you a trick
And she gon' get it everytime
Because she think she the shit

[Chorus: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Hook: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
Sweat ya perm out ladies, sweat ya perm out
Sweat your perm out momma
Sweat ya perm out, sick of drama baby momma
Sweat your fucking perm out
Sweat your fucking perm out, sweat your fucking perm out

[Verse 4: Too Short]
I love that big ol' booty
Give it up. We get a lot of girls
But do we get enough? She can shake that ass one cheek
At a time, she don't ever hold back
She don't wanna be mine cause I'll wear that ass out
I'll put up a word till she pass out
She like a goldfish livin' in a glass house
I told her fuck till it hurts
Then cash me out, bitch. I'm a keep smokin'
And tell these mother fuckers I'm from East Stoken
I'mma knock some raws and try to stay rich
I know she got some flaws
Short dog, I don't give a shit
I'm hard on a bitch, ask these hoes
How these new bitches choose at my last two shows?
Now I gettin' money, and my cash flows
You wanna be like me, but you a asshole

[Verse 5: Katt Williams]
Naw, hot mamma. I don't wanna dance
I wanna know how you got that Escalade in your pants?
I mean that ass ain't human
You might be a martian. You need a tattoo on your thigh
That say "Proceed with caution
" Now I know that I'm a comic
But this ain't a joke, with a body like that bitch
You should never be broke
For every nigga that talk to ya you should charge 'em
A fee, and then give 50 percent of that money to me
And for that small percentage you know what I'll do?
I'll turn that you into a brand new you
I mean a brand new doo, some brand new shoes
I mean a brand new crew, and some brand new jewels

[Hook: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
Sweat ya perm out ladies, sweat ya perm out
Sweat your perm out momma
Sweat ya perm out, sick of drama baby momma
Sweat your perm out, sweat your fucking perm out
Sweat your fucking perm out, sweat your fucking perm out

{Chorus: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]

Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Verse 6: Lil Jon]
Yo, let me put you on my handlebars
Love how I handle park, holdlestone
Battle scar, backseat for badder brawls
Hustle like I want it, My mack dame is bossin'
The reason for this phone call is combo
Is caution. South beach, you boss me
Presidentials, to toss me
Ghetto chick from the bay
Same color as coffee. My whip
Game, and saucy. The first way of thousand grand
Willy ain't shit to me, if it ain't ammount to ends
Jumpin' in and out the benz
Drop you off and swoop your friend
Motivational speech, the beach where I lock em' in
Weavez gets sweated out, my pockets get breaded out
The block is where I'm headed now
The coppers can't shut it down
Pimpin' and panderin, ghetto boys and scandalous
Young niggers that ran with it
California is havin' it, take a stab at it
You feelin' like I'm feelin' man?
First and fifteenth ain't the only things worth killin' man

[Verse 7]
This bitch got taco bell hot sauce
Straws, napkins, lipstick
Eyeliner, frenchfries, on the floor of the corner talking
Bitchshit. She know that pussy something to make you
Forget your first name, she say she got you where she
Want you cause she know you ain't got no game
I slap a bitch so fast for that dumb shit
I ain't playin. Make her ass think twice about that
Bullshit she sayin, bitch be a lady or soemthing
Now go to Santa Monica peer, drink a be
Er, dialate, and find a trash can and kill a baby or
Something. Hoe, I wouldn't blow breath in your body
If I had the power to squeeze koolaid out of a rock
Lesser motherfuckers got more action then me, it don't stop

[Chorus: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
I ain't ever seen a booty so fat, so fat
Till she bent that thing over like that
Like that. There's somethin hanging out the back of
Your pants. I couldn't hold it if I had four hands. Fat booty

[Closing Hook: Katt Williams, Lil Jon]
Sweat ya perm out ladies, sweat ya perm out
Sweat your perm out momma
Sweat ya perm out, sick of drama baby momma
Sweat your perm out, sweat your fucking perm out
Sweat your fucking perm out, sweat your fucking perm out. Fat Booty
