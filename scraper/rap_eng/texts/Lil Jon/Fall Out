[Verse 3: Ali]
Aw, hey, get wet
It's Travis Porter and Lil Jon
When I'm down south, I say "bruh"
When I'm on north, I say "son"
And everytime we out of town, "we got goons" don't mean no gut
Aye, pull up in the club, this song real small
Two dos, cuz a nigga we stunt (ah!)
And yesterday, I looked for [?], ball out
Ran into this chick, she was starstruck, bout to fall out
I might just pull up at her house
Beat it down and just haul out
She say, "Ali, that's all you got?"
Yeah, yeah bitch I'm all out

[Verse 4: Quez]
(Quez!)
Awwww, sound the alarm
Because I'm in the airport and he calling me the bomb
And the way a nigga ball, they be calling me Lebron
Tried to rob me, he was dead, he tried to stab me with a gun
(What?) like Lil Jon
And since this K.E.B, I'm just 'gon rip this shit and run
We in the league, and you in the back like baby seats
When we hit the club and ball, yall just fall out just like some baby teeth (oh!)

[Hook: Strap Da Fool]
Pull up in the mall, all the hoes (fall out)
Cars so damn tall, open the doors (fall out)
Money, money, money just to blow (fall out)
