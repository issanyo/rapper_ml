[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah!
I don't care what time it ?
Whats up?
I'm gonna keep partyin'
Lets do it!
I'm gonna give it all I got (oh me too)
So I need to see you, doin' the same thing!

[Kee]
We'll party, party, p-party
You know we're never sober
Once we step on the floor
You know we take it over
Hands up in the air
We on a roller coaster
Oh, oh oh

[Lil Jon]
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor
Ladies to the dance floor

[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
One night to live (so we live it up)
Then we do that damn thing (then we give it up)
Gimme any kind of shot (then I drink it up)
Gone hit the dance floor girl (heat it up)
Hands up reach to the sky (put em up!)
Get crazy in the club (lets tear it up!)
Don't wanna stop till the sun come up
We gone party every day we don't give a WHAT
Ladies lookin' like super models
Everybody's over here poppin' bottles
Drink it up, full throttle
Fiesta like there's no tomorrow!

[Chorus: Kee]
We'll party, party, p-party
You know we're never sober
Once we step on the floor
You know we take it over
Hands up in the air
We on a roller coaster
Oh, oh oh

Crank it up
Don't stop
You can give it all you got
Let's rock don't stop
You can give it all you got
At the top top top
You can give it all you got
Oh, oh oh

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
Twist and turn let your body rock
Lose control lets your hips pop
Beats so hard make your heart stop
Drink until your body drops
Start the fire let it blaze
Let your animal out the cage
Get wild and crazy
Lets behave ?
?
Anytime anywhere we gone (do it up)
We gone party all night I don't give a WHAT
?

[Chorus: Kee]
We'll party, party, p-party
You know we're never sober
Once we step on the floor
You know we take it over
Hands up in the air
We on a roller coaster
Oh, oh oh

Crank it up
Don't stop
You can give it all you got
Lets rock don't stop
You can give it all you got
At the top top top
You can give it all you got
Oh, oh oh

All the ladies song along now!

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh

[Chorus: Kee]
We'll party, party, p-party
You know we're never sober
Once we step on the floor
You know we take it over
Hands up in the air
We on a roller coaster
Oh, oh oh

Crank it up
Don't stop
You can give it all you got
Lets rock don't stop
You can give it all you got
At the top top top
You can give it all you got
Oh, oh oh

We'll party, party, p-party
You know we're never sober
Once we step on the floor
You know we take it over
Hands up in the air
We on a roller coaster
Oh, oh oh

Crank it up
Don't stop
You can give it all you got
Lets rock don't stop
You can give it all you got
At the top top top
You can give it all you got
Oh, oh oh
