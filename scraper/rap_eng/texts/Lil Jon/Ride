You don't wanna be my target, my nigga

So take ya pick, take a stick, take a brick
Cause niggas round here ain't taking no shit
Ya hoe bitch, ya bitch hoe, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: Rated R]
Now I been missing in action like Bin Laden
Meantime deep in the lab and still rapping
Ghetto Project, stacking, relaxing and still thinking
Hit Lil Jon up for a track and told em let's make it happen
I'm tired of the tongue grappling (fa real)
We can get the guns clapping, betcha that'll get ya toes tapping
Toward the exit, let's get physical
Bump then thump, run for the trunk
Pull out the pump, O-Town gon' now
It's too late to cry, somebody gotta die
Bye bye, now we gon' find out
Who can do they thang in the game when there's no timeout

[Verse 3: Rated R]
You better pray motherfucker
Your life I'm bout to take motherfucker
Duece duece in lake motherfucker
You a fake motherfucker!
C'mon nigga shake motherfucker
Let's see what we can make motherfucker
Money or war, whachu came here for?
Ain't nothing but slugs and a room full of thugs
Whole bunch of hustlers passing out drugs
Watching real close, every hug ain't a hug
That's a transaction, swanging on a nigga dawg is just a reaction
Think what you wanna think but you can not imagine
Nigga I'm a savage, and all that fun shit I won't have it
Y'all better back up and live, play wit ya kids
Handle ya liquor, I hope ya got your boys wit ya
Count em up, cause somebody gon be missing
Wit that bullshit in a fucked up position!
