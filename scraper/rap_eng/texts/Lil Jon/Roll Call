[Lil' Wayne]
Um ok they call me young carter and im big-dog

Thats right im off the chain
My leash ripped off
I gets straight to my goal like kick ball
And im so high if I come down thered be a pitfall
Walk with a limp not like a pimp but like a big doll
And yes baby im on fire like a menthol
My tires big from afare look like the rims off
And I think Cici need a nigga like Lil Weezy um
Ok I hear ya callin mama so its somethin good
We cud get this fire started, nah baby lets cut the wood
And I dont paper chase, shorty I tug and pull
And I dont eat to much or polk but im a fucking bull
Real talk, I like them red shorts
But I swear I love them tight pants
And when u do that lil dance on that mic stand
Stop playin, im payed like a white man
And I think Cici need a nigga like Lil weezy
