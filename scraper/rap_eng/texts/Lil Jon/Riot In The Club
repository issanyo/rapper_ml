Just another day on the streets of Los Angeles where the fone shine the homies on the dime, on the dime me i’m a nickel  plated 9

Tell me have you ever seen my for its beautiful gleaming  like armour all you can come over here
And see it out the back  door nigga

I could  tell from the way you look you ain't down for the ride.  all i knows what I got
All I got’s what I know/ I could  tell from your instary you ain't ready to ride to ride
Pull out the pistol nigga and then busting the slide the slide

Roll in w my tux and my all black dickies dick get your bitches just trying a dickie /dickie
