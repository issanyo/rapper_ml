[Intro - Pitbull]
Uhh, this is Miami's finest
Pitbull, this is Miami's finest
This is Miami's finest, Pitbull
This is Miami's finest, got lost in here
Got true in here, got done in here
Got Diaz brothers, my dog Cubo (Que Vuelta?)
Eeeeoooooo, eeeeoooooooo, eeeeeooooooo

[Verse One - Pitbull] (Lil Jon)
Uhh, this is Miami's finest, I'm soon to blow
But like Jon told me "Chico it's all about timin'"
Patience is a first, and I been patiently waitin'
When I sign, it'll be anticipated
Like the Lakers with Malone and Gary Payton
Pitbull spits fire like I married Saitin
Anybody wanna try it? then Tez go ahead dog
Confess, get it off your chest
Get put in a perminant sloop
You're gettin' in the way of me and these checks
This is the future, they don't throw blows no more
These boys will shoot ya
And they gats that'll smoke you bigger than Whitney Houston
I'm not your regular rapper this is somethin' y'all not used to
Yeah, I look like a cracker but I'll crack ya man it's crucial
So y'all better think twice next time, that's if there is a next time
I wish they would try to take mine
I'll take em' out the game with a tech-nine
It's that chico Pitbull
And if y'all don't give a damn we don't give a fuck
Throw em' up fool! (YEAAH!)

[Verse Two - Sean Paul] (Lil Jon)
They callin' me, to come back to the streets, Sean P. A.K.A a Sharp Crease
Said it was necessary, these sucka' niggas out here very scary
They come from the hole they livin' in the month of February
Ok then, put a sissy nigga on display then
Kick in ya door and have my folk dem' bring dem K's in
I'm still Attic A-double-T-I-C
It ain't a hoe out there fo' real, who don't know 'bout me
Bitch I'm fo sho wit it, don't make me pop that trunk to the 'Lac
Bitch I will go get it, and I ain't selfish I will let you and your hoe feel it
Won't catch me sippin' on no Cris and got a cold billy
It's Youngbloodz A-Town Malt Liquor sippin', comin' straight from the gutter
Toe-tag a motherfucker, leave 'em under a cova'
Lil Jon he drop the beat that make ya bounce like rubber
Sean Paul he tote the heat to make ya mug then slug ya (YEAAH!)

They call me Mr. Herringbone cuz' that's my right hand man
Old school straight foolish like no other indeed
With Lil Jon it's Youngbloodz, they crunk as can be
Attic Crew 105 that's if you lookin' to rumble
Cock back bust aim now I done got yo' number
In the club you gone feel it when it drop this summer
Like rain we gone pour and hit you hard like thunder
Cuz' in the Dirty we them boys that drank you under the table
Where them niggas pimp hoes in fly suits and Gators
In my Chevy so super I'm the one to call
Just dial 1-800-430-slash-alchohol
And dog I'm not the one that you really just wanna clown
I'm cool in my way, but shit still I shut 'em down
And piss on them haters J-Bo he cuts a fool
In the cut 'bout slizzard somewhere that's how we do (YEAAH!)
