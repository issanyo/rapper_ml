Come around, fuck with me, and then you might git rushed
Nawh, I ain't with the yappin', but I make the gat go bust
Keep fuckin' with us, we off the danger-ous

Yee'in think I was gon' pull it up now, did cha?
Besides, dat's my lil' hommie pullin' dat trigga
I hit the mall by my self, the hood by my self

On the Beach of Miami rock Versace with the silk
I'm so gangsta - I eat the cereal without the milk
And nawh I ain't actin', I'm just real like dat

I git money like I fuckin' posed to (Dat's gangsta!)
Yea, I know I'm gangsta - but how 'bout you (Not gangsta!)
All black shirt with the black out shoes
Black tube socks and a matchin' hat too
And my G-Unit jeans straight raw blue
Cuz where I'm from bein' a playa is gangsta smooth
I'm a Guerilla on it all, keep my lil' pimpin' straight on G' mode
All up in the club with my pockets on swole
Oh, you think I'm sweet?! - Then try me ho'
Git stomped to the flo'
I was born in the A, raised in the A
When I did my durrt nigga, I ain't gon' say
Shiit, I was gon' grow up and be a gangsta anyways
Gotta couple of war wounds on the gangsta face
