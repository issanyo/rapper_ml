[Verse 1: Lil Jon]
Drinks up high every time I hit the party
Shots, shots, shots, shots, cause it's time to get retarded
Everybody, everybody grab a motherfucking cup
And drink that shit 'til you get fucked up
Shake that ass like it's your birthday
Stay out all night like tomorrow ain't a work day
Let's get it crunk, let's get drunk
Let's get buck-ass wild, tear it up

[Pre-Chorus: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
Turn the lights down low and let the DJ go
Until the speakers blow
(Stay up 'til the break of dawn)
Take a sip of Jack, she's with a sip of that
There ain't no turnin' back
But hey, I don't care (I don't care)
Wherever there's a party, I'm the first one with a drink in the air
We can share, cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here

[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
Bottles in the air, pour me another one
Who believe in havin' sex? I'm tryin' to get me some
Work it nice and slow, when the bass get low
Jump up on the table and lose control
Fucked up, fucked up, wasted, wasted
Go crazy, get shit-faced
Let's get it crunk, let's get drunk
Let's get buck-ass wild, tear it up

[Pre-Chorus: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
Turn the lights down low and let the DJ go
Until the speakers blow
(Stay up 'til the break of dawn)
Take a sip of Jack, she's with a sip of that
There ain't no turnin' back
But hey, I don't care (I don't care)
Wherever there's a party, I'm the first one with a drink in the air
We can share, cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here

[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)

[Bridge 1: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
We don't want this night to end
We won't sleep (won't sleep), then we'll do it again
(Yeah!)
We don't want this night to end
We won't sleep (won't sleep), then we'll do it again
(Yeah!)

[Bridge 2: Lil Jon & 3OH!3]
Pour me another one, pour me another one, pour me another one
Pour me another one, pour me another one, pour me another one
Cause when we finish this one
There will be another bottle right here

[Chorus: 3OH!3 & Lil Jon]
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
Heeeeeey (Hey, h-hey)
