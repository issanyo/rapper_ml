[Intro: Lil Jon]
Yeah, yeah
Y'all never seen this one coming, nope
Miley Cyrus, Lil Jon, yeah
Ayo, Miley, I don't know why they don't let you grow up, baby
You got to
Let them know you not a kid anymore
You can do what you wanna do, girl
Rock Mafia

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus 1: Miley Cyrus & Lil Jon]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands (Oh)
They try to change me, but they realize they can't (No way)
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man understand

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that

[Pre-Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus & Lil Jon]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go (Let's go!)
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

[Verse 3: Lil Jon]
Dang it, you can't stop me
You can't hold me
You can't have me
You'll me amaze
I like to party
I'm not a baby
I get crazy
You can't control me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Miley Cyrus]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed (You should know)
I can't be, be, be, be (Never be tamed)

[Interlude: Lil Jon]
You can't stop me

[Breakdown: Miley Cyrus & Lil Jon]
For those who don't know me know me
For those who don't know me know me
Just try to change me (Hey)
I go, go, go, crazy (Crazy)
I go, go, go crazy, crazy, tamed
I go, go, go crazy, crazy (Oh)
I can't be tamed
For those who don't know me know me
For those who don't know me know me
For those who don't know me
I go crazy
I go crazy
For those who don't know me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed
