[Verse One: Oobie]
I'm sittin knee on top of you
Doin' things that lovers do
But I don't belong to you
What's a girl suppose to do?
You give me one night with you
To make all our dreams come true
You could never be my man
You can be my one night stand

[Hook]
Boy I know you've gotta a girl
And you know I've gotta man
So lets's both respect the game
And have a one night stand

Everybody wanna know
But they wouldn't understand
So let's keep it on the low
And have a one night stand

[Verse two: Oobie]
Well it's about a quarter to three
And no one's lookin it's just you and me
You know I'm down for whateva and I aim to please
But it's only for this one night

Boy I hope that you'll come well prepared
Cause I want you to know that I ain't ever scared
You just wanna fuck R.S.V.P and I'll be there
But it's only for this one night

[Hook]

[Verse three: Lil Jon]
