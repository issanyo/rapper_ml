[Intro: Lil Jon]
Hey – Eden xo – Lil Jon
It’s the weekend! Let’s go!

[Verse 1: Eden xo]
Started from the bottom with a plan to get rich
So I could chill everyday like one bad bitch
But I'm stuck in the middle and I'm tryna get by
Yeah we all need a little, a little, break sometime

[Chorus: Eden xo]
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
We can let go, sippin Rose, on that poolside Mandalay Bay
Wanna be friends
Phoebe Buffay
Can't get enough of my hot tamale
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Like Everyday

[Verse 2: Lil Jon]
Yeah man it’s time for a road trip ya’ll
Oh yeah!
Let’s head to the Wynn! Hahaha!
Turn up time!
Me and My squad -Summer vacay
Turnt on a Friday - Vegas getaways
Pool party - Shots all day
VIP - We ‘ain't never gotta pay
I could do this e’ryday
Met five new babes
That go both ways – Yeah!
It’s the weekend – let’s party!

[Chorus: Eden xo & (Lil Jon)]
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
We can let go, sippin Rose, on that poolside Mandalay Bay
Wanna be friends
Phoebe Buffay
Can't get enough of my hot tamale
Oh My God, it's the Weekend (Hey!)
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Like Everyday

[Pre-Chorus: Eden xo & (Lil Jon)]
Getting dumb in the morning, dumb in the evening
Dumb like a cherry flavored Dum-Dum
Getting dumb in the morning, dumb in the evening
Dumb like a cherry flavored Dum-Dum
Hey it's the weekend, every day the weekend
Everybody listen up, cause here comes the ice cream truck (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Eden xo & (Lil Jon)]
Oh My God, it's the Weekend (It's the Weekend!)
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend
Hands Up for the Weekend
We can let go, sippin Rose, on that poolside Mandalay Bay
Wanna be friends
Phoebe Buffay
Can't get enough of my hot tamale
Oh My God, it's the Weekend (It's the Weekend!)
Hands Up for the Weekend
Oh My God, it's the Weekend (It's the Weekend!)
Like Everyday
