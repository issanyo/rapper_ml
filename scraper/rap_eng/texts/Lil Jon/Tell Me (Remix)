Mamita why we gotta keep going through this
Talk to her Frankie

(verse 1)
Just Yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That i was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore
And now your telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me
Its hurting my soul
Oh baby

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please dont ask of me to let you goooo

Pitbull

(Verse 2)
Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But i can't understand the reason
When you tell me your leaving
Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
Its like we are use to each other
How could we do this to each other
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now its like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you baby
Its the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl it ain't hard to see
You mean the world to me
We had been though it all
Thick or thin right or wrong
I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go

No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let yo go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Pitbull

(Verse 3)
Look baby just tell me what you want
Look baby just tell me what you need
Look baby i know im far from perfect
But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless
I know its hard to deal with my life
I know its hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen em wit this one
I done seen em wit that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice
Mami you know your my heart my soul my love
And I swear to you baby
I just want to give you my heart my soul my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby lets try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die)

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you goooo
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you goooo

Ken Y

(hook)
Believe me, yes Im trying to let you go
But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
Tell me how am I suppose to let you goooo
No no noooo

Frankie J & Ken Y

(Chorus)
How am i supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you
How can you ask me to let you go
No I just can't let you go
No I just can't let you go
(Nooo)
Can't you see Im slowly dying
But Im gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you gooo
(no i just can't let you go)
