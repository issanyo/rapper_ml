(Chorus)
I got 3 dollars
Can't afford a Bentley
Ole girl kinda fine
I got little money
She got little titties
Can't afford that bitch
She like make me sick
She been sucking dick
Kid a fucking trick
On my fucking life
All this fucking hype

(Verse 1)
And her knees are white
Scratch her head
She got fucking lice
Kick her to the curb
On the third
Now she wanna fight
I ain't really bout it
I'm a pussy
I'm a call the cops
Tell 'em that I'm white so all you fucking niggas getting shot

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I got child support
I'm about to flex
Bitch I got a check
Get my hair done
Now I'm laughing at my nappy ex
She got bird brain
Bird brain
Bitch she fucking dumb
Call her ass a baby cause she like to suck up on her thumb

(Chorus)
