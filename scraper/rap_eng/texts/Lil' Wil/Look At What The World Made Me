Look what the world made me

Fuck my grades and my phone I'm been G'in lately

Would't play me hustlers wouldn't pay me

[Lil' Jessie]
Now they saying stuff just to try and retire me
But God blessed me so I'm ready to set myself free
Ain't going anywhere cause I'm on top of the game
Ain't gonna stop cause right now I'm the best Mc in the game
And they still hating bitch cause I'm worth more then "A Milli"
And they still hating bitch cause I'm worth more then "A Billi"
And they still hating bitch casue I rainned on them with "A Trilli"
And even when times get hard I keep my chin to the sky
And even when I get to heaven I still say I ain't died (Believe That)
They sad, (yes) they mad (yes) they cry (well...) I got one thang to say
To that? (what?) (really?) yeah that's right the princezz is back
So never fear (Noo!) I'll be there (Yaaay!) oh you trippin bitch?
(Yeees!) well I don't care cause I'm still in the top game like the NFL

But move over hater cause it's my turn and they know B
Move over cause...
