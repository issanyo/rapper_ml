(feat. Soulja Boy)

[Chorus:]
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
YEP! flya then a muhfucka

[Soulja Boy:]
Soulja boy off in this ho
Watch me hit my dougie bitch
Twenty thousand on my chain
Stacks on deck runnin this
Step up on da scene
Superclean with my soulja shades
I see a lotta haters
They musta sipped that haterade
Wipe me down clean as I'm rubbin on my head
I'm fresh I'm fly
U heard what I said
Sod money gang money keep stackin
Earrings blingin
Iced out platinum
The center of the flo
Gettin boogie with my partner spain
I told him in 07
2008 is over man
U haters in they mouth
Feel like they talkin shot of novacaine
I'm ridin thru da hood two fifteens in my rover range
Soulja boy tell em
I yua on any ho
They call me sbeezy
Watch me YUA on any ho
And no u can't do it like me
Ho so don't do it like me
Folk I see u try to do it like me
Man that shit was ugly

[Chorus:]
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
YEP! flya then a muhfucka

[Lil Wil:]
Walk up on the set
Stepping on a swag
Clothes got a dro odor so you kno I blow bats
Fresher than a muthafucka pockets got stacks
Hoes lookin over here cause they like ski jack
Chirper goin off like I got a dispatch
[? ] lookin for that work and I ain't about to holla back
Post up on the whip and start lookin for somethin bad
Nice thighs, cute face, and gotta have a phat ass
Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin ya never had
Caught you in the club doin that sexy ass dance
Dropped it down to the floor and bought it back up in a stance
I like the way she workin it
Ass sit right and it's like magic when she twirkin it
Baby don't ya jerk me
I know this is for certain
Cause she gauranteed she let me beat then I'll murk it

[Chorus:]
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
YEP! flya then a muhfucka

[Lil Wil:]
Just gotta fade
Dressed to impress
Bone got a shoe fetish, so you kno I stay fresh
I ain't worried bout that mess
A couple grand up on my chest
Plus drew then bought a tick
And I stay phresher than some sex
Don't want my shoes to get no [? ]
Don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up, if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick
Cause lil will then popped an ecx
And I don't wanna work hard cause I'm feignin for some sex
Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosin
Middle of the club
Jammin hard to my music
Bet ya can't do me like a triple x movie
Pull my dick up out ya p**sy let it slap ya on ya booty
Goin hard in that jacuzzi
On my gaurder like a [? ]
Start ot persuin [? ]
Don't know wat I'm doin
Better check me out fully
Mixed that dougie fresh
With that northside boogie

[Chorus:]
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie, my dougie, my dougie
My dougie
She say she like
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
My dougie, I'm fresh
YEP! flya then a muhfucka

My dougie
