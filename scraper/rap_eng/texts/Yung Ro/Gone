[Chamillionaire]
World what's the deal, yeeah
Been living long, and living wrong (pain nigga)
But I'm still here, yeah
I'm standing strooooooooooong
Well well well, hey (heeey) heeeey oooh
Come on my-yyyy yeeah, ooooooo-ooooooh
Baby, baby-baby m-hmm-hm-hm

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
I had a real lady, but now she's gone
Had so called friends baby, but now they gone
I sat right here daily, like what went wrong
Pain is what I feel daily, that's why I wrote this song

[Yung Ro]
I can write forever bout my pain, till my pen run to ink about it
I'm a sinner dear Lord, if I ain't doing it I'm thinking bout it
Surrounded by these hoe niggas, who sometimes they guys
Use to spend my time, looking in my woman's innocent eyes
But that place in me died, I think it left with the game
And she followed right behind, now I'm just left with this pain
And my so called real niggas, really ain't real
Cause if we ain't getting high, can't find no purpose to chill
Now tell me what's that about, can't fuck with y'all no mo'
But niggas still be thinking a sweet, gon get 'em through my do'
Fuck a friend, trust nobody nigga that's how I feel lately
Niggas turn fake, plus I fucked up and lost a real lady
It's getting real shady, my back against the wall
It's kill or be killed, my attitude like fuck 'em all
But what about my lady, been feeling lonely lately
So I've been finger fucking my pistol, and going crazy
All I feel is the pain, all I know is the game
So I can't quit, love me or leave me I understand
You were my back bone, help me come back strong
And I'm still left, and still need you to come back home

G'yeah uh, pain pain, uh
And I'm still strong, but still need you to come back home

[Hook]
