[Chorus: D Flowers]
Trappin', watch out for the neighbors
I put the food on the table
Fifty shots sittin' on the table
Fifty bags sittin' on the table
I told my niggas I'm able
I showed my niggas I'm capable
Put that bag on your head like a table
We got them Glocks with them lasers boys

[Verse 1: D Flowers]
So we trappin', watch out for the neighbors
Off with that bitch on the table
She ride this dick like a horse ride the stable
I'm on that syrup like it's maple
They tryna watch me like cable
So we gotta trap and watch out for the neighbors, yeah
I had to sleep in the vaco
I'm tryna go buy that house on the acres
I just dropped ten on a zabo
They finna put my lil bro on probation
I know you niggas be hatin'
Don't make me slide on your ass like a skater
Your bitch on my tip like a waiter
She tryna lick on that dick, she been waitin'
I just cracked a card at the Chase
This for my niggas that's dodgin' them cases
You know 'bout them chances we taking
Most of them young niggas tryna make it
Whoever play, we gon' take it
I send the straps to your trap and they robbin' you naked
I know them drug dealers first name basis
I talk to killers on a day to day basis, yeah, yeah
They been done robbed your grandma with a straight face
Gotta eat, no plate
Thirty-eight, no trace
No shed, no case
By the shed, servin' shake and bake all day, hey hey
Heard he on in the hood, junkies couldn't see my old face

[Chorus: D Flowers]
Trappin', watch out for the neighbors
I put the food on the table
Fifty shots sittin' on the table
Fifty bags sittin' on the table
I told my niggas I'm able
I showed my niggas I'm capable
Put that bag on your head like a table
We got them Glocks with them lasers boys

[Verse 2: Yung Ro]
You can't finesse a finesser
I put that dope on the dresser
All these hundreds on camera
I'm startin' to look like a scammer
I been fuckin' bae so good
She start to look like a dancer
I got that sack on me right now
I'm startin' to look like I'm Santa
Bein' broke made me humble, ran a bag up all summer
Trap spot doin' numbers, straight drop keep 'em comin'
Fifty shots on the table, all of the bullets gon' wake up the neighbors
I was broke, unstable, now they askin' me for favors
I got the flavor, I got the recipe
The pot it go skrrt skrrt, it sound like a melody
He say he don't like me, that sound like some jealousy
I'm laid up with a bad bitch smokin' this rapper weed

[Interlude: D Flowers]
Trappin', watch out for the neighbors
Fifty shots sittin' on the table
I told my niggas I'm able
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3: D Flowers]
We finna pull up and shit on the haters
Your bitch wanna do me a favor
I told the bitch I can't labor
But I told my niggas I'm able
Trappin', watch out for the Gucci snakes
I put the food on the plate
I see the fake in your face
You want the steak off my plate when I'm sayin' my grace
I been on some cool shit lately
I slide through the hood with a halo on
'Cause most of my niggas on papers
My killers call me on a payphone
I might go get me a trap in your kid's name
But that chopper my main dog
Keep a chain on my neck like Django
Pull up to your block in a Burberry raincoat
In a Range Rover, that bitch fell down on a hangover
Give me that syrup, now leggo my eggo
Who got that shit by the caseload?
I made your bitch catch the vapors
I flew that bitch with my slippers on
She tried not to wake up the neighbors
Know they think a nigga never home
My niggas on go like Diego
And they gon' shoot when I say so
I told my brother 'nem lay low
Why you saw it is able
This for the places you can't go
All of my niggas need help though
And it's gon' cost a nigga 'least fifty to get all the cases closed

[Outro: D Flowers]
Trappin', watch out for the neighbors
Fifty shots sittin' on the table
I told my niggas I'm able
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Trappin', watch out for the neighbors
