[Intro: Mistah F.A.B.]
Yeah
The big homie DJ Daryl
Yeah
I love you Frost, forever
Your memory gon' live on
Young Ro, it’s a granny, huh

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
And every nigga in my city got a chopper on him
No life insurance, they ain't worried 'bout a doctor for him
Got caught up with a pistol, now he need a lawyer
Them lil’ niggas you was runnin' with ain't doin' nothin' for you
They fuck around and backdoor you for your main bitch
Should've listened to mama, she said they ain't shit
But that's the life of a brodie when you in these streets
’Cause all he wanted was a Rollie and some gold teeth
From my side to the East, Hedge Row, my niggas know about this
My young nigga on parole but he’ll go about this
Jumbed off the curb to these streets and he a man, you been a boy
Made ten racks last week in a tenderloin
Hustle for the profit, I was tryna get up
Fuck 'em if they ain’t with us, they ain't ridin' with us
Man, this street shit sick, young niggas is twisted
But I can't judge you, lil’ bruh, get it how you live it

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I just got out of prison
My PO on my dick and he keep on trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, cuz, get it how you livin'"
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I'm fresh out of prison
My PO on my dick and that nigga be trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, bro, get it how you livin'"

[Verse 2: Frost City]
Shootin' guns at a young age, tryna make hi a name
Granny stayed on his back daily, prayin' for a change
OG's taught him well, youngin, stay in your lane
Any problems with these suckers, then I'm uppin' the thing
Had a baby at a young age, shit got hard
Man they killed Lil Bobby, really left me scarred
And it fucked the family up, man they fell all apart
It ain't no sucker shit, nigga, growin' up in the Park
In these streets gettin' money, gotta have that heart
You shed tears behind them bars, man, you not that hard
I know niggas servin' life, homie, knock that off
Keepin' money on my phone, just accept that call
Everything I been through made me who I am today
Yeah that boy from the Park but that boy don't play
Made it out of situations, should've been gone today
Still keep the banger on me and the same since pray

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I just got out of prison
My PO on my dick and he keep on trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, cuz, get it how you livin'"
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I'm fresh out of prison
My PO on my dick and that nigga be trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, bro, get it how you livin'"

[Verse 3: Young Ro]
Suckers want my head but the hoes want the bread (Yeah)
PO still trippin', I be tryna shake the feds (Ooh)
Slidin' on ice, I ain't talkin' 'bout a sled (Nah)
Lot of real niggas level four, eatin' spreads (Free Sam)
Raise by the real, we don't fuck with the fake (Nah)
Cut the grass low, watchin' out for the snakes (Ooh)
Baby got water, dove in like a lake (Dove in)
Kicked the door in 'cause we heard he got a safe (Got it)
Still bang the four to the five to the six (To the six)
Still bang the four leaf, I hit quick (Ooh)
Bet the ten or four, we ain't worried 'bout shit (Nah)
Spank his whole block, big bruh sent the hit (Rrah, rrah)
Raised in the mud, I ain't never had shit (Never)
Walked in the mall like let me grab this (Give me this)
Too many choppers, can't even stash it (Nah)
Too many P's, can't even bag it (Nah)

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I just got out of prison
My PO on my dick and he keep on trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, cuz, get it how you livin'"
He said, "It is what it is, big bro, how I'm livin'
Got a baby on the way and I'm fresh out of prison
My PO on my dick and that nigga be trippin'"
I said, "I can't judge you, bro, get it how you livin'"
