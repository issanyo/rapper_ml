I wanna be closer, to you

[Yung Ro]
What's up homie you know me, one of many with smile face
Still complaining about this life, full of pain with a small plate
But I understand your plan, and you the man
And now that I'm hurt, I desperately need to hold your hand
Cause over the years this pain, has made our relationship much stronger
I'm patient and much stronger, but still facing this bad karma
For real it's too real, you see these vibes I'm getting
Mistreated by my own blood, you hear these lies I'm getting
But these guys forgive em, me too cause I am sinning
Trying to find peace in places, the devil disguised and hidden
I'm drowning in my own sin, realizing my pain
Losing faith losing love, all flushed down the drain
What can I do to maintain, I tried my girl and family
Find myself alone in tears, dear God how can it be
Or can it be all for a reason, because we just need you
Well if so then so it be, and let them see the message too

(*talking*)
Close, close I gotta get close
You gotta keep a piece of mind, I know I do
I ain't perfect

[Yung Ro]
Dear God I'm scarred, I'm trying it's hard
You right it's easy, I'm close it's far
It's dark I'm cold, I'm wrong I know
I'm trying I'm dying, I'm crying my soul
Is searching for forgiveness, I'm trying to do better
I can't sleep it's sic o'clock, and I'm writing you this letter
Show my people I love em, because they breaking my heart
Show me a sign, should we work it out or just stay apart
I just wanna play a part, in your righteous path
I can't drive this car alone, because I might just crash
They say I take things too serious, I'm taking that serious
And God to be serious, I think I am too serious
But you made me who I am, and Yung Ro proud
I don't know I don't know, what's beyond them clouds
But I do know love, and I thought that through you
But sometimes I give up, and I don't know what to do

(*talking*)
I was just thinking, relationships
No desire, how close you is to that person
Now I messed up, anyway

[Yung Ro]
Dear God my baby's hurting, I don't know what to do
So I sent a prayer out to her, guide her ship and help her through
Help us make it through this pain, I wanna learn this lesson
I felt the love was so real, but it just wasn't destined
A lot of questions lot of guessing, as I start to look back
We made a lot of mistakes, and ended up where we at
But that's that, and truthfully I wish I could take it back
Do something different try harder, anything but that
But that plus that, made me realize that
And when I saw it face to face, I had to swallow that fact
I learned a lot from that what's that, that's nobody's bidness
Just know I'm truthfully sorry, and ask for your forgiveness
And God as my witness, I'm a very troubled man
Thought I was right I wasn't, thought I did didn't understand
But one thing I do know, if it was meant to be
We'll get closer than maybe not, who knows we'll see

(*talking*)
Yeah close, I ain't gave up
I ain't gon worry myself though
Lastly, God I'm gon get closer bet that
You are now with the world's greatest
Yung Ro, Mr. Pain Mr. Nobody
