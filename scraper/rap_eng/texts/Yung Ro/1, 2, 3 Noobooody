And a 1 and a 2 and a 3 nobody!
And a 1 and a 2 and a 3 nobody!
My nigga sip, my nigga e, my nigga b, nobody!

Come and fuck wit nigga, come and fuck wit it (nobody!)
Who gon fuck wit it nigga, who gon fuck wit it (nobody)
My nigga sip, my nigga e, my nigga b, nobody!
My nigga j, my nigga shay, my nigga p, nobody
Come and fuck wit nigga, come and fuck wit it (nobody!)
Who gon fuck wit it nigga, who gon fuck wit it (nobody)

And ive bin, dyin' to meet someone who grime like me
Ain't possible, nobody! got a mind like me
Who can go over ya head, make ya rewind that beat
Play catch up, and don't catch up, to rhyme thats we
Wit no ice, no gold, I still shine when I speak
Smokin' till I'm jus, (whew) blowin' pinds of weed
In a old school hoop, screens behind the seat
Boogie, stunned marko, x and I can't find the sweat
I'm tired of niggas eatin' for free, when I grind to eat
I got a lost bullet, who wanna play finders keeps
Bois gettin' cocky now, it's bout time to speak
Real niggas show me love, and haters grind they teeth
You got plex, bitch throw me, shoot a nine at me
And I'm like a butcher, cause I handle all kinds of beef
People askin' mac, how he go about findin' me
Cause I already got three verses done, I had to find a beat
Kissed my main chick, and had the girl cryin' for weeks
But ain't nuthin changed, you got nobody, start dryin' ya cheeks
The game, has bin tooken, look it how they lookin'
The way I drop this light weight, before they even fly the hook in
Gyeah, ay
I'm from the place where they box, and don't break no fights
In nobody land, we get trained to break yo mics
Shake up dice, speak once don't say thangs twice
Give my niggas love, new comers don't shake hands light
Over dance them dumb niggas, they gon pay us twice
Some cookin'in my kitchen, and we don't bake up rice
A born hustler, bin one ain't gave up right
I'm so fast I had to slow down, and wake up life
Haha, lemme slow it down, do a show and clown
While on the streets, theres rowin' sounds
See how fast it go around
Gyeah, where my nobody team
Paid in full, color changin' click, nah I mean
Uh huh, I'mma young fly cocky
Mutha fucka,and ain't nobody gon stop me
Girls love me, they say Yung Ro crazy
Plus she love the way I hop out, and say what's up baby
They say Yung Ro so coo, what a foo
He is, ro no mami I'm so meish
Ye, I'm me, Yung Ro, fuck wit it, nobody!

And a 1 and a 2 and a 3 nobody!
And a 1 and a 2 and a 3 nobody!
