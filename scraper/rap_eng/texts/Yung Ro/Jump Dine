[Hook - Yung Ro]
I'm gettin' crunk in this motha (jump dine with ya boy)
If you ain't scared go ahead (jump dine with ya boy)

I think these boys want plex (jump dine with ya boy)
If you a real motherfucker (jump dine with ya boy)
I got my hood to the roof (jump dine with ya boy)
I'm about to knock down the mall (jump dine with ya boy)

[Verse 1 - Yung Ro]
It's late night, I'm on x lookin' for someone to jump dine wit me
Paul ro wit a whole, boogie on don't lock, and plus can't find Mippy
So I jump dine quickly, call my connect and hit the spot
Handle my business went back home, then I pulled out the drop
Headed to the mall, to spend some of this underground money I'm makin'
So what better place to buy my chuck tee's, than an underground station
I jump dine, new Kango, new kicks, new sweats, new jersey
Fresh cut, fresh fades, new jays, it's nuthin headin out like ten thirty
My dirty, I don't need you watchin' me, how I'm spendin my money black
Cuz I'm a grown ass man, and if I want it I can jump dine like that
I got hoes, that give head, I got hoes that pop x
All of 'em smoke weed, and I even know some that jump dine on wet
Me myself, I get high, lean talk shit and get crunk
Take shots to the head with Big Pluck and see who the first to get drunk
My philosophy, reach a high vilosity, you only live one time
Life is a bitch, so fuck it you might as well jump dine

[Verse two - Mippy]
You see the playas I spit, and the hoes I hit
The bricks I flip, whodi we runnin' this shit
Say Ro (what Mip?), I'm about to jump down
And when I do I'm a hold it down, like Master P on lock down
Make ya hear how the Glock sound, when it rumble in ya ear
Oh you lookin for dough, we got bundles over here
It's one hundred over here, ain't no fumblin' over here
When I spit I fuck ya head up, so wear a condom over here
I rock dicalins, everybody know that
When I hopped out the mc, up in the nobody throw back
I was gonna holla at this hoe and fuck around (fuck around)
But I'm a do it like Rizzo said, and nigga jump down
Whoa

[Verse 3 - P.Jersey]
Spread Glocks when I aim (why?), cuz I spray that way
I got the size of bigger ?, my cash is clay
I'm bout to jump dine, when I'm reppin' the nobody
I'm bout to hop out, when I'm parkin the wide body
It's the P.Jersey, so stay focused man
Ridin' around with rims lookin' like the cealin' fan
24 inches sittin' high above the ground
Boys used to come through, but now they jump down
Jump dine wit yo click, if they tryna do sumthin'
Jump on a bitch nigga, if he tryna prove sumthin
It dont matter if you from the city, or a country tine
When ya see them nobodies, holla jump dine
