(*talking*)
I hear y'all talking, I know you trying too
I know he don't wanna meet ya half way, and I know what happened after that
But I think there's a way we can work it out, all we need is understanding
You feel me we gon try to do that, understand come on
Put your hands up uh-uh-uh, put your hands up my name Yung Ro man
I'm one of the ones you know, come on
If you feeling it like I'm feeling it right now, what I want you to do
Put your hand up to the sky, and rock with me
Yeah-yeah, come on listen up uh

[Yung Ro]
Now you been crying all day, listen up you make up
I know it wasn't your fault, you didn't wanna break up
But you gotta wake up, and look at the picture
You got dogs and hoes, ladies and real niggas
And who you'll end up with, shit you never will know
But I gotta use my brain, to keep a lady from a hoe
Cause if a hoe break my heart, I should of known she was fake
Now if a lady cheat on me, then that was my mistake
Cause a lady gon need a reason, but she'll go up your letter
And if I'm off note, she deserves some'ing better
Cause she's a lady, and that's hard to be
And also hard to find, so I'm a D-O-G
And honestly I feel bad, I broke a few hearts
But this bullshit fame, just fucked me up from the start
So if you love him just tell him, give him a kiss and a hug
Cause even a dog, can't turn down unconditional love

(*talking*)
Understand that try to yeah, all we need is understanding you know
I understand ladies, for real for real you know but look out
On the real, I can't leave my dogs out you know
Y'all fail to realize that y'all act understanding sometimes too
So you know I'ma spit it from a man's point of view
So don't hang up the phone just yet

[Yung Ro]
Understanding, is something we both need
Since we can't see eye to eye, nothing but drama we see
It's not a happy home, it's too much pain and confusion
Got wars going on in my head, and I'm losing
So you and that bullshit you stressing, disappear
I don't need it in my life, it's too real over here
And I hope he make you happy, cause I see that I can't
Your love ain't like mine I'm stressed, I see that you ain't
You still doing you running with who, shit I don't know
Letting time pass you up, living the life of a hoe
And I know you was so guilty, kept your face disguised
And when I kissed you swear to God, I could taste those lies
So bitter so sweet, you a dangerous woman
But I can't fuck with ya mama, cause you ain't never showed me nothing
It was like murder she wrote, when she spoke up like I died
Lord knows a nigga tried, help my understand why

(*talking*)
Yeah you know, understanding is a beautiful thang
Ha at least when you got it, ha-ha but look out though man
You're now in session with Yung Ro, Counselor
Slow motion with me, yeah
