[Intro]
What you call an icon living?
Started a record label AOMG, did it
H1GHR MUSIC ambitions
We be on a mission
High gear, [?], boy, you were reminiscing

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go, fuckin' party (mhm)
People flexin' make me catch a body (mhm)
Takin' shots like the paparazzi (mhm)
Couple girls, they waitin' in the lobby (mhm)
Put the whole squad on my back, yah
Put a naked dancer on my lap, yah
I ain't a computer but a Mac, yah
If you don't know better, check your facts, yah
Don't fuck around, I'm in the town
No sittin' down, yeah, we about to stand up
They shootin' wit' the iPhones here no burners
But everybody put your hands up

[Chorus]
Uh, I'm just an icon living
I'm just an icon living
I'm God of my fans [?] style
Braveheart, Jay Park, man, I am Mel Gibson (no)
I'm just an icon living
I'm just an icon living

[Verse 2]
Bygones can never be bygones
Bygone you know where they be seeing you missin', woo
Damn, we're all one team but I must say
Check my stats, I feel like LeBron James
Feel like I'm HOV and my girl Beyonc√©
Yeah, we about to make it front page (front page)
We about to make the front page (front page)

[Chorus]
I'm just an icon living, oh
I'm just an icon living, woo
I'm just an icon living
Started a record label AOMG, did it
H1GHR MUSIC ambitions
We be on a mission
High gear, [?] boy, you were reminiscing

[Bridge]
Get this [?] lit, boy and hang it from the ceilin'
Wait, what ceilin', boy, we be outta your vision
We be outta space, boy, in the fourth dimension
This time I'm boutta hit but I'm ain't ever comin' second woo
Dreamcatcher hanging over your bed (bed)
Don't let this go over your head (head)
I keep my whole family fed (fed)
I sleep, but I don't need meds
Need a bad bitch and a bottle of Soju
Couple of Ginja shots, boy, I bought it at Whole Foods
Now I'm fired up, yeah, I'm feelin' like Goku
This is the alpha male shit, boy, I'm 'boutta go postal woo
Lotta mailmen
Lotta motherfuckers fake it in the moon landing
I'm just a legend
I feel like I'm destined
Ain't no doubt, no question
Now you angry with the textin', boy, you too passive, woo

[Verse 3]
Damn, I'm just an icon living
If you don't believe me, motherfucker, come to Asia
Like the Billboard, see my face all in it, woo
Damn, I'm just an icon living
Poppin' bottles, all cash, no credit
'Bout to start my own Soju notion
Mom says I work six years, she chillin'
Son made broke pay, now he get millions (millions)

[Refrain]
I'm just an icon living
I'm just an icon living, woo

[Outro]
Damn
Got more will than the fresh prince
Verse me, boy, you askin' for a death wish
Yeah, take your girl on a sex trip
Yeah, ha
