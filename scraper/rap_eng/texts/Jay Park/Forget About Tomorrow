These August skies
Hot summer nights
With broken hearts
Come brand new light
And in the dark
Is where we’ll start
From the beach to your bed
All of me is what you’ll get girl
All night long

Let’s forget about tomorrow
Cause we’re living for tonight
Girl forget about tomorrow
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Let’s forget about tomorrow
Cause we’re living for tonight
Let’s forget about tomorrow
And just live it up tonight

These autumn skies
To winter night
Keeps moving fast
Cause time just flies
And when I’m gone
Will you think about us at all
Will you ever fall in love as hard
Will you please be strong

Let’s forget about tomorrow
Cause we’re living for tonight
Girl forget about tomorrow
Cause we’re falling in love
And we’re breaking back up
Let’s forget about tomorrow
Cause we’re living for tonight
Let’s forget about tomorrow
And just live it up tonight

Let’s forget about tomorrow
Let’s forget about tomorrow
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
Cause we drinking all day
And dancing all night
