[Verse 1: Jarv Dee]
Uh, ohh I like this lady almost better than weed
But baby ain't hots only stats to [?]
Go and tell me what you want
I got whatever you need
But I'mma baller on a budget, I ain't tryna Gucci
I've been catchin' vibes from across the room
We've been linking eyes, like whatcha about to do?
I see you with your friends, so I act natural
I made it to the bar come over casual
I really would like to compliment your shine with this glass of wine
Thinkin' in my head it would be a crime
The way I would crack your spine
Let me get your number, in fact, let me give you mine
See, I wanna link tonight
But I don't think we have time (But I don't think we have time)

[Chorus: Jarv Dee]
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah

[Verse 2: Jarv Dee]
It was a Tuesday, it was raining
I liked it that way
Wasn't complainin'
Down the block from the spot where I was stayin'
That's when she came in
Vibin' to the music that was playin'
I was impatient
I asked her what her name is
Then told me it was Kisha
How she stayed out in V.A
Her homegirl was the DJ
How she been here for like three days
She was going tomorrow
Ordered a drink, and she got mascato
Lost track of time, swallow, in our convo
Her homegirl said, "Go grab your bag, we leavin'"
I tried to make her stay
Gave her every reason
She smiled back and said, "That I'll be..back in a warmer season."
Gave her my line
I made sure that she had mine
When we meet again I hope that we’ll have time
I'mma catch you fallin'

[Chorus: Jarv Dee]
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah

[Verse 3: Jay Park]
Yeah, hit me in the moorning, fuck that
Let me hit it till the moorning, I want that
My bad for being blunt
I'm not high, just a little drunk
Girl let me show you a little somethin'
Come back with me, Soju pourin', yeah
Girl, we dancin' too close
What's up next
I can't let you go
Perfect picture
Girl hit the pose
Deliver it to you like I never know
Girl I'll get you breakfast in bed
Got that protection on me so girl we ain’t blessed

[Chorus: Jarv Dee]
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah
So hit me in the moorning, yeah
I don't care if I'm still yawning, yeah
Hit you back if you not respondin', yeah
I'mma get you when you fallin', yeah

[Bridge: Kris Kasanova]
Alright shit, haha
You thought I was not gonna jump on this?
[?] ay
Hey, woah, woah
How ya [?]
I'm a parachute man, I ain't comin' down
Lady hit me with the chain I guess I'm higher now
[?]
[?] away for you can't fuckin' drown
[?] around
Don't you ever touch my crown
Goku on a cloud
I don' even touch the ground
Bitch I'm from the town
I'mma pull up on you now
See that you think [?]
I-I-I- I'm tailor-made and you still afraid
Hand me a mic and I'll kill the stage
[?]
Nigga, you don't want the drama
Put that on your mama
I'mma do the honours
You don't want this trauma

[Verse 4: Kris Kasanova]
Ay, realization to a better life
So please don't block this lane to the finish line
I've been going hella hard
[?] just to play that at dinner time
Homie better re-evaluate his moves, if he think he 'bout to finish mine
Homie, look at me, look at my wrist
I ain't got no watch, I ain't got no time

[Outro: ]
[?]
Just a window, problem, we go louder
'furno, suckers, [?]
We go higher, higher everytime
We go higher but it's going down (we go higher but it's going down)
We go higher but it's going down (we go higher but it's going down)
We go higher but it's going down (we go higher but it's going down)
We go higher but it's going down (we go higher but it's going down)
