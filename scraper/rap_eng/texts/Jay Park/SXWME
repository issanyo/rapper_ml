[Chorus]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Intro]
I said my lady
Say yeah
Say ooh yes
Ye ye yes

[Verse 1: (Kev Nish + Prohgress)]
The sexiest thing I've ever seen
No filter thighs, smoking like Nicotine
Tryna stretch you out like a limousine
Sex on fire, spread the lotion like kerosene
Girl, you I know I stay with it, wet up like bidet with it
Body like a playground, time to foreplay with it
Kill it, get away, like that first 48
She relate, no escape, build a case and i still stay in it
Lady take off
High sex drive got your boy speeding with the brakes off
Burn that cake off
Turn that thang raw
You my main line, give you FaceTime
Bout' to break it down with the cape off
Bout' to pass it to the homie like she down with Nate Dogg
Blowing up the hood that little mama napalm
Got me callin in the morning till the till the break of dawn
Little sip of henny and it’s on

[Chorus]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Look, I love you harder than a rock girl
The moon shining like the diamonds on my watch girl
I love your bottom so let’s take it from the top girl
Red light district, but don’t let that stop you
There ain’t nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Yeah we be up all night fuckin’ til’ the sun come up
Girl lemme break your walls, like I was a juggernaut
Girl that's the Renaissance what I do is a work of art
Let’s get lit off the champagne
Turn off yo' phone who cares what yo' man’s sayin’
Get nasty like the old LL
We'll be doin’ it and doin’ it and doin’ it well
Play with it, lemme watch ya'
Notorious when I’m in the sauce
I gotta gun between my legs, i'm bout' to shoot up yo' place
Cause I love it when you call me Big Poppa

[Chorus x2]
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, if you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?

[Bridge]
Now can i get nasty baby?
I wanna spread your legs open wide
And lick you up
And lick you down
I said lick you up
And lick you down
Now I’m gonna turn your body over
Make you scream over and over, yeah
I can give it to you
I can give it to you
Give it, give it, give it to you

[Chorus]
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
Baby, you want me to be
I can be your new fantasy
Love me hard and fulfil my needs
Don't you want to have SXWME?
