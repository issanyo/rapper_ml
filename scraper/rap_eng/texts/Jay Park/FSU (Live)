Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)

Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (yea, yea)

[Bridge]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (but I am back with the vibes)
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (yea, back with the- back with the- back with the-)

[Verse 1]
Let it ride, yeah ride, let the fire ignite
Yeah it burn so hard, let the ashes rise
Let my passion die, then come back to life
I’m the holy one, never pay yo' price
I do R&B but they want me to rap
You rappers ain't doin' your job right
The Roc called me in to come up and just pick up your slack
I son’ed the whole K-pop industry
The moment I started, on Father’s Day they call me dad
I’ll put out an album and win an award
And then say, "OK, cool," and be back in the lab
I do TV and magazines shoots, shows, then go right back in the booth
While runnin' two labels that I own, take care of the fam and the crew, whoa
Tryna shed some light on my city, for really, who else move like I do?
Official, no whistle, I’m takin' the game by storm, no typhoon, whoo

[Chorus]
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up (yea, yea)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (yea, yea)

[Bridge]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (but I am back with the vibes)
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (back with the- back with the- back with the-)

[Verse 2]
Back with the vibes
How ya set up a plane
Kept it alive
Look at the head of the office
Turnin' the TV, watchin'
Kept it alive
Give me the mic
Give me the beat
Yea watch me animalize
Look at the clock, it is my turn yea
You just passin' the time

[Verse 3]
This might be your first encounter with me
But believe me I ain't no fuckin' rookie dawg
Livin' life up on the edge, but try to get to Heaven
Can't ain't nobody push me off
As long as I'm hard when I'm with your girl
I don't really care about lookin' soft
Jay Park this mothafucka bitch
In the words of [?] who the fuck are you all?
I'm goin' in, I don't really stall
Hustlin', grindin' 'til we have it all
[?]
Fuck your reply we finna really ball
Unless you're my girl or talkin' big business
And I prolly won't pick up your call
If your justice system crooked, tell me why
Why the fuck do we have to follow your law
Let's get it

[Chorus]
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up (yea)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (yea, yea)

[Bridge]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (but I am back with the vibes)
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes (lookin’ at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (back with the- back with the- back with the-)
Back- Back with the vibes, back with the, yeah
Back with the vibes, back with the
Back with the vibes, back with the, yeah
Back-

[Verse 4]
They lookin' at Hov like "Where you find this kid?"
They lookin' at Hov like "You're innovative"
They lookin' at Hov like "How you move like that?"
I'm lookin' at Hov like "I appreciate it"
It's opportunity, I know they hate it
Couple steps from achievin' greatness
Couple million in my pocket but still like feelin' like
"Homie I need to make it"
Oh yea
