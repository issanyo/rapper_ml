[Verse 1]
At first I didn’t see it girl
Couldn’t see past that smile and that fat ass
You said you didn't party much
Acting like you came straight outta math class
Said you never met someone like me
Someone like me baby baby
I was caught up in your honesty, honesty, baby baby
But then I started asking’ about you
I found out some things about you
Girl tell me that this isn’t true, oh no no no
I heard you know some of my crew
They told me the things that you do
I really hate to admit it but

[Hook]
Oh girl I change my mind
Ooh girl you ain’t my type
I seen this shit before
Oh girl your no surprise
Oh girl I change my mind
Oh girl you ain’t my type
I seen this shit before girl your no surprise
So I’m having second thoughts about you you you
Thoughts about you
Thoughts about you

[Verse 2]
Girl I really want it but the homies said
They saw you at industry parties
Dressing half naked girl working that body
Hanging round VIP
Only talking to the ones poppin’ bottles
And who look like they be ballin’
You said you didn’t know who I am
But I see you followed me on Instagram
Girl I see you scheming with a fucking plan
Tryna take my dollas like you Uncle Sam
And I almost fell for it
But the homie’s let me know
Let me know about you
So I’ma ignore it
Stay clear outta view, stay clear away from you
Can’t ride in my foreign
No first class trips, no shrimp with the dip
This could’ve been you
Could’ve all been you
Could’ve all been you but

[Hook]
Oh girl I change my mind
Ooh girl you ain’t my type
I seen this shit before
Oh girl your no surprise
Oh girl I change my mind
Oh girl you ain’t my type
I seen this shit before girl your no surprise
So I’m having second thoughts about you you you
Thoughts about you
Thoughts about you
You looking so good girl
I really wish you weren’t but
The truth still is girl
You a fake ass hoe
You a fake ass hoe
We could’ve been together
I would’ve fucked you so good girl
But it will never happen cause
You a fake ass hoe
You a fake ass hoe
You a fake ass hoe
You a fake ass hoe
