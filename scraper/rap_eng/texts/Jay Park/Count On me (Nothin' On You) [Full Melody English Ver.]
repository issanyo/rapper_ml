Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

The only thing that I
Wanted more than your sweet touch
Is the time I get with you
Babe I need you oh so much
Im feeling that, Love, peace with U (Love, peace with U)
Im feeling that, Love, peace with U

So am I
The one to make you feel
The way you have me babe
Trying to tell you that its real
There ain't nothing more to say
From this moment on, Love, peace with U (Love, peace with U)
From this moment on, Love, peace with U

They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Coz they got nothing on you baby
Nothing on you baby

Theres no much nonsense
Its on my conscience
Im thinking baby I should get it out
And I dont wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering if there was something that you wanna know
(that you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
Cause we dont wanna be a t.v episode (t.v episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go, go)

No one else I want
Cuz no one else compares
The way you show me love
Helps me to chase away my fears
You gotta trust, Love, peace with U (Love, peace with U)
You gotta trust, Love, peace with U

So am I
The one that has your love
There is no one else for me
Im saying we were meant for us
Youre the only one I see
Simply put, Love, peace with U (Love, peace with U)
Simply put, Love, peace with U
