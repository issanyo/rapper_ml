Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 Vs
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[?]
[?], living like a boss
[?]

[Verse 5: [?]]
They wanna see me fall like the ball on New Year's Eve
They seem to hate the boy, how I continue to proceed
Man, I'm doing this for me, my family and my team
My country and all the peoples that be living out their dreams
They don't wanna see a high, chinky-eyed motherfucker rap
Let alone remix the hottest shit upon the streets with Joey crack
Rap stars, trap stars, run a city like a motherfucking track star
Twist a backwoods in the backyard
Straight fire, fresh off the boat, then collect the [?]
I been connecting dots, got jewels and drops
And now I move the watch, so just watch

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up

[Bridge: French Montana & Infared]
Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 Vs
Got bottles, got weed, got molly (I'm all the way up)
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

[Chorus: Infared]
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothin' can stop me, I'm all the way up
