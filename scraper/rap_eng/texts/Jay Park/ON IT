Going you
Where I'm going you
Where I'm going you
Where I'm going you
Going you
Where I'm going you (I don't front and I don't go backwards)
Where I'm going you
Where I'm going you (I don't front this and I don't like shit)


[Verse 1: Jay Park]
YO!I'm a history changer
Wings of an angel Jesus on his manger
Hate that I'm winning looking miserable ain't yah?
Ya'll in lyrical danger spittin heavy when I'm on the mic
Electrifying like Benjamin Franklin with a kite
I do this for my people so they can eat too
Korean, English and I talk money so I'm trilingual
And yes I know that I am chosen though I don't speak Hebrew
What I have common with Martin Luther is that I'm a king too
Guess I'm an architect the way I've built my career from the bottom up
Bet you wish that you could be a part of it
Honest men not a lot of them but plenty snakes in the grass
But I'm protected like a broken leg in a cast
Plenty cake to be had everyday's a celebration
Time is precious, never waste it
Life thus far has been amazing
So I'm thankful when I'm praying no backboard but I am banking
I will blow through all my foes who hate I'm Goku super saiyan

[Hook: DJ Wegun]
I'm on it, on it
I've never fallen off it
They remember me when I'm layin' in my coffin
I'm on it, on it
I've never fallen off it
They remember me when I'm layin' in my coffin
We'll lie, we stand the test of time
We'll stand the test of time
We'll stand the test of time

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
I said I don't rap I just go and state the facts
My methods blew y'all away
You can call me breaking bad
Fuck you and your basic raps
You can go and take it back
Some of y'all just trying too hard, you should try to stay relaxed
No lie
I'm the motherfucking truth
So sick, every meal I eat chicken noodle soup
Your girl's waist I put my arms around
Like a hoola hoop
Shooby doop I'll sing my way inside her pants
Right to her coochie cooch
I flew the coop don't shoot or hoop but spit it like a beast though
Your girl be cute I toot and boot and serve her like a bistro
Uh, I'm young wild and free
Every encounter I'm making sure they remember me, uh
From juice box to juke box and joke tellers say who knocks
And I'm fly and you flew not
From boom bap to boom bop and who's hot your crew nah Dwayne Johnson I do rock
I smack down these bars onto these tracks yeah and its too raw and I'm gone

[Hook: DJ Wegun]
I'm on it, on it
I've never fallen off it
They remember me when I'm layin' in my coffin
I'm on it, on it
I've never fallen off it
They remember me when I'm layin' in my coffin
We'll lie, we stand the test of time
We'll stand the test of time
We'll stand the test of time

[Verse 3: Jay Park]
Listen, look
Seattle to Seoul, I control my soul so they troll
Cause I don't be fitting every bodies typical mold
I spit lyrical gold got a spiritual flow here on this coast
I'm the illest here man, let it be known
Don't put in work on the streets I put in work for my peeps
K.O these rappers man, they seeing stars counting the sheep
I'll call your written's "seven days" cause your raps are all weak
Surprised to see a kid from "Kpop" spit like a beast, uh
Feel the adrenaline know I be killing em raps I be spitting 'em people be feeling 'em
Put the beat to rest the verdict is that I be
Guilty like Zimmerman
Drinks I be drinking 'em thoughts I be thinking them not gonna rest til' I'm making these millions
Want a girls with a fat ass
Mexican, Black, or Brazilian
My minds is brilliant I am resilient
I do the maximum you do the minimum
Probably why we are planets apart
You can call me falcon millienium
Yeah, young Jackie Chan when I stunt
Don't hate bitch you know I'm dope
Don't front
