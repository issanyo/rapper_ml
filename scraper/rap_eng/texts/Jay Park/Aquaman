[Hook]
(I need a Cha Cha beat, boy)
Come meet me in the hot tub girl
I'll bring the champagne
And you just bring that body here
And we can do our thang
Girl we can make sweet love all night
Till the sun shines in our face
Come meet me in the hot tub girl
The hot tub girl

Oh girl the candles are lit and
All that's left is me kissing your lips
And let me call you mama
Cause we about to make a baby
And before I go put it in
I'll go underwater girl just like a fish
And the way I stay down there
You gon' think I'm Aquaman

[Verse 2]
Baby oh
When I'm all up in it
I'm gonna get lost up in your sea
And I know when I'm finished
You'll return this favor back for me

[Hook]
Come meet me in the hot tub girl
I'll bring the champagne
And you just bring that body here
And we can do our thang
Girl we can make sweet love all night
Till the sun shines in our face
Come meet me in the hot tub girl
The hot tub girl

Oh girl the candles are lit and
All that's left is me kissing your lips
And let me call you mama
Cause we about to make a baby
And before I go put it in
I'll go underwater girl just like a fish
And the way I stay down there
You gon' think I'm Aquaman

[Post-Hook]
I’ll be deep in your legs
I’ll be making you wet
Like it’s my super power
You gon’ think I’m Aquaman
I’ll be surfing your waves
The way I’m holding my breath
Like I have super powers
You gon’ think I’m Aquaman

[Verse 3]
Baby I know you were waiting on a hero
So I’m here to save you babe

You and I can get down like its our job
And I will be the best you ever had
So please baby girl
