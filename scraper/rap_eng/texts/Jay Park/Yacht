[Intro: Jay Park]
Yah
(I need a Cha Cha beat boy)
Look, yah

[Chorus: Jay Park]
I should buy a yacht just to take you on it
Wanna take you 'round the town just to watch you flaunt it
You're so pleasing to the eye, I'm just being honest
For you, I'm down to go broke, empty out my pockets
I be like you're my dope, I'm so high
Baby work, girl work like Rihanna
Girl, you know I don't ever lie
This a song I wrote just for my baby

[Verse 1: Jay Park]
I can't have you in the open, girl
I can't have you in the lonesome, girl
'Cause too many dudes be hoping, girl
Scheming, they wanna steal my girl
But oh no, that won't ever, ever happen
'Cause I'm that fly Asian guy, I'm the captain
I be so wavy when whatever I be bragging
Get you in submission all night, you be tapping, yeah
Taking it from coast to coast
Scuba diving in the ocean shore
Fuck around and take you on a world tour
Versace dropping on the bedroom floors, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Park]
I should buy a yacht just to take you on it
Wanna take you 'round the town just to watch you flaunt it
You're so pleasing to the eye, I'm just being honest
For you, I'm down to go broke, empty out my pockets
I be like you're my dope, I'm so high
Baby work, girl work like Rihanna
Girl, you know I don't ever lie
This a song I wrote just for my baby

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Just for my baby, just for my baby
Hit me up baby, on the Kakao baby
Gimme good lovin', we can get down baby
Get down baby, ay

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I could make your coochie rain, don't tell FEMA, ay
His and hers Gucci Mane, don't tell PETA
Cover your ears all in blood diamonds 'cause you know you're mine
I don't even wear diamonds, but I want her to shine (yeah, yeah)
I like the conversations (yeah)
Tell me 'bout your classes (ooh)
Give me brain like a geek (geek)
Don't take off your glasses (ay)
Email CC (ay)
I put Chanel on your feet (ay)
I wanna read your body language
I don't like reading receipts
Steal my girl (ooh, ya)
Good luck Charlie
You must be Jason Kidd-ing me, put some bucks on it (ay)
Throw a tux on it, that mean I got cuffs on it
She on my arm like that Balenciaga clutch on it
Valentine's Day shopping
Now I'm rollin' down Rodeo with you shotgun
Banging Rage Against the Machine, I'm not a player, I'm a king, ay
Checkmate a nigga if he try to take my queen, woo!
I ain't time for playing games (okay)
I get you wet like Training Day (uh huh)
I put my girl in Human, ain't no Bathing Apes 'cause she my baby
She get low for me just like a 808

[Chorus: Jay Park]
I should buy a yacht just to take you on it
Wanna take you 'round the town just to watch you flaunt it
You're so pleasing to the eye, I'm just being honest
For you, I'm down to go broke, empty out my pockets
I be like you're my dope, I'm so high
Baby work, girl work like Rihanna
Girl, you know I don't ever lie
This a song I wrote just for my baby
