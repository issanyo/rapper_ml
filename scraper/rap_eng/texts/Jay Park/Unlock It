[Intro: Charli XCX]
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it, lock it, lock it
Unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
(Beautiful)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the rain
You got the candy colored eyes
Pink and gold chain
Million dollar babe
Whip it out, like I'm propane

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
You're on my mind
I'm feelin' kinda nervous, but I like it
Take my T-shirt off, and do it right
You're on my mind
The feelin', like an astronaut
Watchin' the world, all alone, just you and I (you and I)
(Beautiful)

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it, in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane
(Beautiful)

[Post-Chorus: Charli XCX]
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it, lock it, lock it
Unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it, lock it, lock it
Unlock it
Lock it, lock it, lock-lock it
Got the key, can you unlock it?

[Verse 2: Kim Petras & Charli XCX]
Caught in a lip lock, when we pit stop
Cosmic kiss, tastes like cherry maraschino
Ride, passenger seat, tropical heat
Eyes so red, you could be my Valentino, yeah (woo-ahh!)
If you want my heart, then don't you drop it
(Want my heart, then don't you drop it)
I'm right here, right in your pocket
(I'm right here, right in your pocket)
Pull it, cock it, never stop it
(Never stop it)
If you want my love (my love!), try to unlock it

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
Rollercoaster ride, in the fast lane
Got the roof down
Kiss me hard, in the pourin' rain
Yeah, I can see it, in your eyes
Know you feel the same
Million dollar babe
Trippin' on it, like propane
(Beautiful)

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Unlock the swag, Rae Sremmurd
Make you hit them high notes, like you a tenor
Tell the big, appetite, girl, you my dinner
I know they could do you, but I could do it better
Bring me out to London, yeah (U.K.)
I can show you somethin', yeah (somethin')
Unlock your clothes, off your body
Give you lovin', yeah (let's get it)
'Cause that's how we do (that's how we do)
You wantin' me too (wantin' me too)
Your type be see-through, ooh (type be see-through)
I'd like to preview (like to preview)
We not there yet, girl, but we on the way
We on the surfboard, yeah, we ridin' waves
Let's get it going, girl, let's andale (andale)
Let's andale (andale), sip this champagne (ah)
