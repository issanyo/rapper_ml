You say you'll try

I'm not sad, I'm not cryin'
If you mad, then that's fine, but I think that I should go

You coulda had Gucci, but now that's Old Navy
And your homegirl wanna date me, she shady, baby

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Look
넌 내 맘 들었다 놨다 해 (어쩔 땐)
내가 좋아보여 분명해 (근데 또)
장난은 아닌 거 같애 (헷갈려)
넌 항상 흐지부지해 왜
약속을 잡은 넌 그 다음 날 취소해
왜 대화를 잘하다가 넌 또 끊어 왜
이젠 네 생각 안 해
다른걸 한참 즐길 때인데
Girl, I coulda made you famous
이제 행복해 넌 매일, yeah

[Chorus: Jay Park]
Said, girl, why are you playin' with me? (Playin' with)
Girl, who are you playin' with?

And I been on the same shit
So, girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
I don't got no time for that
I'ma need a refund
I'ma need that time back

[Post-Chorus: KYLE]
Girl, why are you playin' wit' me?
Girl, who are you playin' wit'?
