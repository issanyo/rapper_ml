[Intro]
I need a Cha Cha beat, boy

[Verse 1]
I can only do right by yuh
I won't never go deceive yuh
I'll even dye my hair blonde for yuh
I can be your Justin Bieber
Give me that work like you RiRi
Girl, pop it like 3D
Grant wishes like genies
Oh let me see that ting baby

[Bridge]
Trust in me
This is the moment you've been waiting for girl, all your life
Tell your friends that you don't need a ride home
Cause I got you tonight
The Uber's on the way cause I had a couple drinks tonight
But I'm more drunk off of your love
Baby, I just can't get enough
So baby girl

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up, wake up, let's get it started
Stay up, stay up girl, I'd be on it
Don't go to bed unless you go with me
Phone blowin' up, I'ma let the hotline bling

[Hook]
Baby me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
(I hope you know it
I hope you know it)

[Verse 2]
The way you workin' that motion
Girl, you got me in a trance
It's like I'm crossing the ocean
Journey to another land, oh no no
Bae you are the fittest and oh no no
Ooh, you're pullin' on my pants, oh no no
I wanna rock your, rock your body
Girl, you got me so excited

[Bridge]
Trust in me
This is the moment I've been waiting for, girl, all my life
I have no other intentions, only just to go and do you right
Baby surf the waves together in the moment of our lives
It's an unforgettable love
Baby I just can't get enough

[Pre-Hook]
Wake up, wake up, let's get it started
Stay up, stay up girl, I'd be on it
Don't go to bed unless you go with me
Phone blowin' up, I'ma let the hotline bling

[Hook]
Baby me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
(I hope you know it
I hope you know it)

[Verse 3]
Baby, look into my eyes
We inside your paradise, baby
Paradise
Feel the breeze up on your skin
Capture this so it'll never end
Never end

[Hook]
Baby me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should

[Hook]
Baby me like yuh
I'll make you feel so good
Do you just like I should
(I hope you know it
I hope you know it)
