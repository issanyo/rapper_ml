Yo,lemme start this right away, take it out

Infinite bars, I'm a monster truck killin' you cars
Black hole diminishin' stars, the kid pissin' you off
I'm the missal, the bomb, explosive, blowin', hittin' you hard
Never witnessed somethin so great, probly think you seen God
I'll break ya wrist and ya arms, hips, ribs, and your jaws
With a flick of my first,bitch,kid, mission accomp
Blishery, still live, come back, I'll finish you off
Electrical current in water, y'all just fish in the pond
So dead and so gone, fruit make you look like Eve and her husband
If my name was Steve you could be takin' my job
I'm a innovator, inspirator, instigator, see you later
Sip your haterade and make a drink, it's called yellow flavor
The hottest product out and y'all be my buyer
Pass me out, put me up on walls cause I'm flyer
Though I changed your wheels before, I never get tired
I'm spittin' shit that so hot, I should probly get fired
Molded into greatness, and no I am not Play-Doh
I am Popeyes spinach, and y'all just couch potatoes
Make chips outta you and maybe put you in the bag
Cause y'all flow be so garbage, man y'all lookin' like trash

Uh, yo

I'm on top to bottom, cause y'all lookin' like ass
You must a cigarette, cause y'all lookin' like Ahh
If you think you're dope, then maybe I will smoke you
No chip on your shoulder, I will give you a broke tooth
Actin' like a tree, but we both know you got no roots
On the dance floor I am more funkier than old food
Yup, what I started doin' just to try
Now I am no student, Art Of Movement till I die
I got some different shit in me oozin up inside
You'll be like man, I wouldn't mind losin' to this guy

Hah, yo

I be PS12 and y'all Nintendo the old
I got so many bars, it's where I'm gettin' my gold
Y'all just sucky poker players destined to fold
All you Boyz II Men, this is the end of the road
Jacob from Twilight, cause I go and be on beast mode
Eatin' motherfuckers cause I go and be on feast mode
Raps a naked Eskimo and you flow be the least cold
If you don't like that there, it's fuck you like I'm Cee_Lo
It's not Friday, but I'm Debo
Get off the planet, there's no room for my ego
I get it done and kick a punch, this shit is just a minimum
I'm every super hero, super villain all mixed in one
Man, you know I mastered the craft, kid you seen it
I'll take the apple off the back of ya Mac and just eat it

Hah, yo, Check it

Now you mistaken, if you ever think Jay's soft
I'm from Nordstroms about to rip your retail off
In this game, no ball involved, no west east play off
Just cause I sing, do not mean I'm a female dog
I'm that blue thing from X-Men, you tired then take a rest then
Like two sticks I rub together, a pad and a felt pen
Create fire, so you meltin'
Raps is what I'm best in
Got your head bobbin' like all of you are yes men
Like fish on my line, takin' the bate I place
I should change my name to Tom, cause you can't take MySpace
Just movin' along the lines man, base by base
Until I hit home and make everyone say my name
I'm a lyrical miracle, please don't take offence when I spit at you
It's like a ritual cause I'm gon'make you see my vision too
No visions one, your vision's done, like vision impaired, listen son
Sharp off the top, head lookin' like the Simpsons' son
There are no janitors, so my dome is a mess
Like my mom's name was Blessin, I was born for success
No room to evolve here man, I go the tightest style
I'm my own hardest critic, I don't need no Simon Cowell
My time is now
Okay, I'm gonna milk it like a cow
Give y'all black eyes like, boom boom boom to the pow, sucka

Yo, lemme double time this shit real quick

Uh

I ain't never gonna fail, I've lost it now
Better send me to jail, I'm the problem child
Make cheddar all day, at stack the piles
Gonna prevail, sucker Spartan style
King of the castle, Dumbledore
Don't got no more steps left to stumble more
Continue to fight in this rumble yo
Never had a kid, make it look this easy
Breezy like the Cover Girl beezies
Voice that'll make them girls feel freaky
Dance like them crews on ABDC
So incredible, give you the heebie jeebies
Nobody be sayin' that he be greedy
All for the fam man, see we beatin'
Give you nightmares if you feelin' sleepy

So do not nap on me suckers

Uh, Jay Park, Art Of Movement, Wassup?
