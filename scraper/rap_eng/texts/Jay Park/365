[Intro]
I need a Cha Cha beat boy

[Verse 1: The Flavr Blue]
I was holding on
So afraid to be alone
Couldn’t get you off my mind
Or delete you from my phone
But I had to turn the page
Had to close that chapter
We had a good time
But now I’m
Movin' past ya
Gotta focus on mine
I’m finding my horizon
Now that I don’t gotta
Worry about you

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Park]
I got a lot of time
Cause I ain’t gotta
Spend it with you
Opened up my eyes
Nothin' on my mind
But what I wanna do

[Chorus: Cha Cha Malone]
365 with my baby
24 hours a day
Now I’m liberated
Ain’t a damn thing
Standing in my way

[Verse  2: Jay Park]
Get it my way, I been in
The penthouse chillin' all day
Feet kicked up like
It’s a Sunday
Whiskey wit a rock cause
I’m feelin' like Jay
Ima kick it wit my crew
Cause that’s what we finna do
Pop some bottles and
Make some news
I mean what I say you know
I do this everyday

[Bridge: Jay Park]
You know I (you know I)
Got no problems
Got no worries now
And I don’t need
You to come around
You’re no longer
What I think about
I’m going up until
I’m in the clouds

[Pre-Chorus: Jay Park]
I got a lot of time
Cause I ain’t gotta
Spend it with you
Opened up my eyes
Nothin' on my mind
But what I wanna do

[Chorus: Cha Cha Malone]
365 with my baby
24 hours a day
Now I’m liberated
Ain’t a damn thing
Standing in my way

[Outro: Cha Cha Malone]
365 with my baby
24 hours a day
Now I’m liberated
Ain’t a damn thing
Standing in my way
