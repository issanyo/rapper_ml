MAN JUST WANNA GET PAID  - 우기 (Feat. 박재범) 가사

There's a war goin on outside
So they wanna send me away
But I don't fight I’ll love u down
To ur soul all night till the end of all days
Wrong or right I sin again and
Again oh lord please forgive me I pray
But to survive I do what I gotta do
CAuse a man just wanna get paid
You are You are You are
CAuse a man just wanna get paid
You are You are You are
CAuse a man just wanna get paid
You are You are You are
You are You are You are
You are You are You are

Even if the tides wash it away
Even if I were stuck in a maze
U know that I do I do

Even if the jungle went up a blaze
Even if there was no one to chase
U know that I do
U know I do I do

I look for it everytime
For it everytime
Can't find it
For it everytime
I look for it everytime
Can't find it
I look for it everytime
For it everytime
Can't find it
For it everytime
I look for it everytime
I can't find it
