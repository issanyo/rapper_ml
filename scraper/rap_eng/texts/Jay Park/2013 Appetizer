[Intro]
Yeah
C'mon
Jay Park, Cha Cha, AOM&1lli

[Verse 1: Jay Park]
Ahh C'mon!
I built this shit from the ground up
And can I mention there will be no 9/11, you can never break me down son
Work hard, play hard, serve bars, stay sharp
Always on the go, even though my name is Jay Park
I'm on you radar, from Sydney to Bangkok
Seattle to Seoul spittin' Guru knowledge, Gang Starr
There's a growin' gap between us cause I'm spittin' space bars
Swimmin' in women and I do not need no safe guard
I kill mics man, you'll be seein' casualties
Money good lookin', boy I get paid handsomely
I be drinkin' Crown, so you can call me majesty
Your girl whack me off and you?
You're just whack to me
You think I give a fuck though?
I be feelin' real hard, like my homies cut throat (what up)
Even though it's all love, throw you off this love boat
So the only question is will I fuck you up? Nahhh
But I ain't a bitch though
While you're hating on me, boy I be gettin' rich bruh
Get your broad on me on the worst way
Oohh see them cakes when I get her in her birthday suit (damn)
Got me stiffer than a surf board (surf board)
So I'm fuckin' her tonight (her tonight, her tonight)
She be yellin' World Star (World Star)!
And I ain't even in a fight

[Hook]
With these words man I dance on the beat (yeah)
With these words man I dance on a beat (yeah)
With these words man
With these words man
With these words man I dance on a beat
Man I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie (what? what?)
Yeah I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie (what? what?)

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
I cherish life man, breath by breath
I go out and just do it, I ain't living check to check
These kids on the block only take it step by step
Man I ain't no psychic, but you bet I'm next
Aww yeah don't get it twisted like contortionists
If you don't see my vision boy then you better focus in, notice it
This ain't boastfulness
Blow it up with explosiveness
Leaving oceans all motionless
Recognize I'm the Golden Kid
You better call Ed Murphy
Drunk up in the fast lane, yeah I'm swervin'
Schoolin' mutha fuckas boy, yeah you learnin'
Flow hot on these heat waves, yeah I'm surfin'
I'm not perfect but you know I keep it real
Always coughing up these raps so you know I keep it ill
You can call me George Foreman cause I'm all up in your grill
Man the game is my prey, and I'm goin' for the kill
What up

[Hook]
With these words man I dance on the beat (yeah)
With these words man I dance on a beat (yeah)
With these words man
With these words man
With these words man I dance on a beat
Man I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie (what? what?)
Yeah I jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie dog
Jam jam boogie (what? what?)

[Verse 3: Jay Park]
If you didn't know
My name is Jay Park and I'm nice in two languages
Check it out (Hah)
Yo!
내가시애틀에서왔다고 나를비웃어?
나는니가쓰는해드폰처럼 니 "기" 눌러
이미지부터 내혼까지난 리얼해
앨범낼때마다다른가수들은위험해
Baby 난영원히뜨거워
넌겨울날씨에있는커피 빨리식어버려
별보다크게되도 그때나의모습어떨까
척주가뿌셔져도난내사람들을업구가 boyy!
It's AOM&1lli bitch (1lli bitch, 1lli bitch)
Can't nobody fuck with us (fuck with us, fuck with us)
If you mad about that ('bout that, 'bout that)
Then mothafucker suck it up (suck it up, suck it up)

[Outro]
Yeahh
Shoutouts to my crews: Art of Movement, Korean Assassins, PPA, 1llionares
What up, I see you
It's Seattle to Seoul homie
We talk some shit
Just sent 300k to my moms and pops to buy a house
Haters can eat a dick
Ha!
