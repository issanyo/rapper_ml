I'mmah dick to you when I should be giving dick to you
You tried to teach me love but I cannot see the principles
I was the shit to you but now I ain't even shit to you
At first it was all good, now the ends becoming visible
Now listen you, you are like a drug that I'm addicted to
I know your bad for me but at times all I think is you
When your creepin with another man you act like I'm invisible
But I ain't frontin girl cause we both know that I'm cheating too

We hurting each other more and more everyday
I think it's bout time that we go our separate ways
This love this love is hopeless
This love this love is hopeless
No no no
This ain't working out girl out girl out girl I'm sorry
But if you get lonely lonely lonely call me

Or I'll probably call you

Was it really love that we were falling into?
Or was is just that we were comfortable
And the s** thing was so fun to do
And we thought we were untouchable
Now we hung and we can't cut the noose
Yeah it's like this
It's fucked up, but that's how life is
As the story goes on a happy ending looks farfetched
The chemistry was there but we both failed the subject

We hurting each other more and more everyday
I think it's bout time that we go our separate ways
This love this love is hopeless
This love this love is hopeless
No no no
This ain't working out girl out girl out girl I'm sorry
But if you get lonely lonely lonely call me
No no no
This ain't working out girl out girl out girl I'm sorry
But if you get lonely lonely call me
