[Intro: Jay Park]
Yeah look at their faces, look it
Look at their faces, look it
Groovy Everywhere
Look at their faces, look it

[Hook: Jay Park]
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up, nah
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up, yeah

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes
Why you actin' surprised, lookin’ at me with those eyes
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes

[Verse 1: Jay Park]
Let it ride, yeah ride, let the fire ignite
Yeah it burn so hard, let the ashes rise
Let my passion die, then come back to life
I’m the holy one, never pay yo' price
I do R&B but they want me to rap
You rappers ain't doin' your job right
The Roc called me in to come up and just pick up your slack
I son’ed the whole K-pop industry
The moment I started, on Father’s Day they call me daddy
I’ll put out an album and win an award
And then say, "OK, cool," and be back in the lab
I do TV and magazines shoots, shows, then go right back in the booth
While runnin' two labels that I own, take care of the fam and the crew, whoa
Tryna shed some light on my city, for really, who else move like I do?
Official, no whistle, I’m takin' the game by storm, no typhoon

[Hook: Jay Park]
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up, nah (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up, yeah (fuck shit up)

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin' at me with those eyes (lookin' at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (but I am back with the vibes)
Why you actin' surprised, lookin' at me with those eyes (lookin' at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes

[Verse 2: G4SHI]
Everybody was surprised, that I wasn’t surprised
They be sleepin’, need a mattress 'cause they all love to lie
My success be hurtin’ eyes, can’t go to bed with a sty
Shout out all my Brooklyn guys, we be splittin' the pies
Man I’m whippin’, I’m whippin’, I don’t get mad, I get distant
Tell them I quit all the bitchin', just hit the stove in the kitchen
This a Rollie, no Nixon and I be hearin' the disses
You never wanted no friction, yo’ pussy ass can go missin'
You know who gon' find you, some old man fishin’
Bitch must I remind you, mind your own business
I’m so gifted, it’s a wrap like a ribbon
And I don’t see peace 'cause the world wearin' mittens

[Hook: Jay Park]
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up, nah
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up, nah (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn't know I could fuck shit up, nah (fuck shit up)
Look at their faces, didn’t know I could fuck shit up, nah

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Why you actin' surprised, lookin' at me with those eyes (lookin' at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes (but I am back with the vibes)
Why you actin' surprised, lookin' at me with those eyes (lookin' at me with those eyes)
I am not yet up on stage but I am back with the vibes
Back with the vibes, back with the, yeah
Back with the vibes, back with the
Back with the vibes, back with the, yeah
Look

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Bitch don’t kill my mood, put my wrist on cruise
Trap up early, kitchen cook a birdie
She was cookin' breakfast, I was whippin', 11:30, hey
Trappin’ in my Forces, I could pay your mortgage
Boy you just be cappin’ 'cause you really can’t afford it
Too much ice, too much ice, said it twice
Took your bitch, I might let her spend the night
Sippin' ac, sippin’ ac, brought it back
Money old like a Cadillac
Fuck yo’ bitch one time and then you took her back
Fuck it nigga, I been married to them racks

[Outro: Jay Park]
Look at your face, look at you
Look at your face
You didn’t know, you didn’t know
Nah
