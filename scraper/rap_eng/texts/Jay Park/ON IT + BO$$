[ON IT - Verse 1: Lil Boi]
Someone said this beat is hiphop
Those other bastards just sell emotions and that’s fake man
Maybe if I do it, I wouldn’t do it like that
Because hiphop was macho to begin with
I’m gonna erase the song cry from my iPhone
Treating girls bad like a bitch ass?
Like American hiphop lyrics, I got wifey, girlfriend, mistress
Well fuck that
I’m always honest in my lyrics, won’t try to be fake
My watch is cool, I’m waterproof
Different from trap followers, I make it Dali Van Picasso like an artist
My dream is for Korea’s hip hop pie to grow bigger but nobody’s Einstein
Everyone’s fighting each other but something is clear
Recently, a certain company’s cypher said
Rapper vs rapper, label vs label
I got challenged and now it’s time to repay you
The air has changed and some can’t handle this fight
I’m sorry, but you just entered the grand line
The mask is coming off now, the frozen waves are getting stronger man
We back again, of course this time is the center of change again, wassup

[BO$$ - Intro: Lil Boi]
Yeah
It's AOMG gang in the building
These motherfuckers [?]
Yo
[?]

[BO$$ - Verse 1: Lil Boi]
Hold on, the scars on my face are rising like Scarface
My dream is to live in a house bigger than China
Yeah I’m dreamin' bout the cars, hoes, moola
You will never know this feeling
I’ma steal Al Pacino’s cool ax and car
But he won’t even notice, then I’ll take the watch too
I’m the boss bitch, you know right?
My dream is too big so it’s like I’m dead
My sleepwalking flow, don’t need to bow your head
There’s so many bastards who treat me like shit, it’s kinda funny
Cuz it’s Show Me, whatever they write in their verses are lies
So fuck the money, fuck the fame
I feel like I am the boss

[BO$$ - Verse 2: Paloalto]
I don’t wear suffocatingg neckties on the weekdays
I don’t need to go to work, I get up and make my bed
Then I slightly bop my head
Kids who wanna be like me still do heading on the floor
I perform and have fun, as if it’s not work
I don’t uselessly calculate, as if I’m not Bill
I do what I want, as if I’m not on the bottom
Like how we treat each other with loyalty even though AOMG’s Park Jae Bum is on top
What’s higher than my income is my mood
Hold my hand tightly because your forehead is pretty
A rapper who borrowed Jordans for Show Me The Money
Now has a car and house that are millions, it’s all mine

[BO$$ - Verse 3: Jay Park]
Yo
I don’t need a job, I’m a motherfucking boss
I do what I want, don’t need to worry
Idol rappers should thank me, I paved the way
Do a little more research, you’re not there yet
I’m not old but everyone bows to me in 90 degree angles
The winner is Song Min-Ho anyway but even if we get kicked off, we’re still proud
What do you expect from Show Me The Money?
We’re so stupid for coming on this show
But since we’re here, David, Sik-K, Geegooin, Lil Boi, turn up man, fuck this shit
Wherever we go, we get acknowledged, never without swag either
Music chart rankings aren’t too bad either
Oh yeah, we’re popular with the girls too
Yeah so think before you say and talk some shit about AOMG
Think of it as an honor that these pros are on this program
