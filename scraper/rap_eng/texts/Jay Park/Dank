[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
It’s you and I, you and I, you and I
Let’s get lifted and meet in the sky
Fuck a keyboard, oh girl you’re my type
Let’s shoot a movie all night

[Hook]
Cruising in a drop top
Girl show me your tatas
We some kung fu masters
Kickin' it, kickin' it
Hotter than Sriracha
Fancy like a lobster
Soju fully stocked up
Sippin' it, sippin' it

[Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Look at the team, we shinin'
Ben Baller did our chain
They call me King, your Highness
Don't fuck up my feng shui
Baby girl, let's run away
Bali, Jeju in a day
Lord, please just keep us safe
Board the plane

[Pre-Chorus]
Takin' off, we takin' off, takin' off
These haters hatin'
We shake it off, shake it off
We breakin' bread
Break it off, break it off
We poppin' tags
We don't care the cost

[Bridge]
Fucking shit up, leavin' a trail
Open your eyes, you'll find it
H1GHR the gang, AOMG
Yeah it’s the perfect timing
Shit about to blow, about to hit the fan
Seattle to Seoul, yeah I'm feelin' like the man

[Chorus]
It’s you and I, you and I, you and I
Let’s get lifted and meet in the sky
Fuck a keyboard, oh girl you’re my type
Let’s shoot a movie all night

[Hook]
Cruising in a drop top
Girl show me your tatas
We some kung fu masters
Kickin' it, kickin' it
Hotter than Sriracha
Fancy like a lobster
Soju fully stocked up (yeah, look)
Sippin' it, sippin' it

[Verse 2]
Sippin' it, sippin' it
Now I be giggin', I'm giggin'
Yeah, I be swimmin' in women
Feel like my blessings infinite
So I thank God
I thank God one time
This is my world
I'm living my best life, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We takin' off, we takin' off, takin' off
These haters hatin'
We shake it off, shake it off
We breakin' bread
Yeah break it off, break it off
We poppin' tags
We don't care the cost

[Bridge]
We don’t care the cost
And I don’t know where we goin', hey
But wherever we go
We lookin' fly, mothafucker yeah...

[Chorus]
It’s you and I, you and I, you and I
Let’s get lifted and meet in the sky
Fuck a keyboard, oh girl you’re my type (you’re my type)
Let’s shoot a movie all night

[Hook]
Cruising in a drop top
Girl show me your tatas
We some kung fu masters
Kickin' it, kickin' it
Hotter than Sriracha
Fancy like a lobster
Soju fully stocked up
Sippin' it, sippin' it
