[Verse 1: Jay Park]
You better wear that dress I like
It’s a special kinda night
I'ma take you for a ride
Hop in, Driver, you can take your time
Put that classic R&B on
Pour you something you can sip on
'Cause we gon' get it on tonight (Oh, oh)

[Climb: Jay Park]
Champagne glasses on the door
Baby you can get comfortable
Don’t worry I’ll be good to you
Get used to this like it's nothing new, baby
It’s just us two on the road
Driver, put up the window please
Baby girl, come close to me
Party's startin' in here tonight

Leather seats, yeah they feel so smooth
All we need is a stripper pole (yeaaah, yeaay)

[Verse 3: KRNFX]
Look, yeah
We up in the limousine right now, baby
Take you 'round the town, you know my style
Tuxedo all black
And my pockets on fat
All the haters fall back when they see us prowl
Feelin' like its prom night
Between me and you its on right on sight
The dom on ice
I got that pipe
Might talk so nice
I might get you naked, then I’ll be on you like white on rice (uh)
Just know the car ain't broke down if we pull ova
We can take few shots like there's do ovas
We can get it poppin' right now
The driver sneak peakin' through his back mirror
I don't ever act different
I’ll never switch it up on ya
So don’t ya ever switch it up on me
Oo laa baby
This night's 'bout to get crazy
Up in this limo, yeah you my lady
Let's get it

[Chorus]
In the limousine (oooo, ooo)
We be dancin', we be movin' (dancin' we be movin')

Everybody feelin’ good up (so good, so good)
