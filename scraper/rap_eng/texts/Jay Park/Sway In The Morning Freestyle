[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Sway in the morning, what
Check
Listen
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
My bars from the stars, Guardians of the Galaxy, uh
I only fear God, ain't no army harmin' me
I want to be harder than Cardi B up in a sauna, B
The human torch cannon with a mouthful of wasabi
From K-Pop to Roc Nation, this shit's an anomaly
One of a kind lyrics that rhyme, but in all honesty, fuck modesty
I'm done being modest, count me out, but look at my numbers
Don't slumber, suckers stop paying homage, right?
What I say only makes sense
Listen, you can't clone the real, but I still manage to stay fresh
I own this shit, you only pay rent, I'm causing mayhem
Slip with the K-Dance, no trees 'cause I'm paper chasing
The seat is vacant, uh, I'm here to take my spot
Calling Drizzy Drake, I'll see you at the top
I'm that motherfucking Asian man, no sir, I ain't Jackie Chan
Stunting on these motherfuckers like my name was Gucci Mane
If you don't know you about to find out
Fake shit, never ever coming out of my mouth
North West, never rest, yeah, I'm repping my town
Some of the homies with them things that let it go "Bla-daow"
Look, I tell 'em chill, life is bigger than that
I teach game and change lives and show it's bigger than rap
We motivate the streets, help 'em eat, they tipping they cap
Never met the little homie, but still send him a rack
So he free to feed his family, what's realer than that?
Not from the hood, I'm not a gangsta, I'm not a killer at that
I'm just a man who wanna see a lot of winners, that's facts
I mean wherever I go, never put on a mask
So you could stare me straight dead in my chinky eyes
Go-with-the-flow kinda guy, but not afraid to swim against the tides
Never switching sides
The type of captain that'll sink with the ship
I sip my soju then I wave goodbye
But I'm Aquaman, I'm so wavy
Comfortable in the ocean, world is mine for the taking
Yeah, I got it covered like a tip with a pasty
Kicking heads like a fucking Cocker Spaniel that's chafing
Let 'em eat off my plate, but wash the dishes myself
These rappers wishing for some followers, I'm wishing for health
For my family and my loved ones, get dollars by the lump sum
I'll never sell myself short, my legacy's wealth
They'll lie for the internet
Die for the internet
Trap like the internet
Stuck like they in cement
Crooked cops roaming free and they jailing the innocent
Born in this country, but I'm feeling like a immigrant
So we gotta look out for one another
You're my brother, I don't care about your race or color
If they beating up on you, I'm feeling some type of way
So I'll make sure that we all good to live another day
I've got compassion in my heart with the mind of a genius
The hustle of a street dude, the patience of Jesus
When I say it I mean it
Everything to me [?]
So if it ain't about nothing, motherfucker just keep it
Listen, some of these young ones need to put their pride aside
'Cause sometimes their ego is deadly as cyanide
Ain't nobody gotta die, you ain't gotta ride
Y'all both human beings just ain't seeing eye to eye, that's it
Don't fall into the abyss, it's all a crock of shit
The system want to break you down and get rid of your wit and grit
Wanna see you shackled up and living in your piss and shit
Meanwhile they're making stupid money and they staying lit
These are my observations, I never go on vacation
These woman be my temptation
I'm cooking, I need a apron
I salaam alaikum to the heavens and earth
Say a prayer for my enemies, but never in church
Better is worse, I've seen a lot of lonely millionaires
I've seen a smile on a orphan although shit ain't fair
I can't fix the world so I leave it in God's hands
Just know a little part of me will always care
Sway
