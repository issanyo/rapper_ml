Lyrics from Snippet
[Intro]
Peace for my shawty she be goin' after peace
Need a visa just to see her on the east
Love when she talkin' for the lesson got me weak
Her booty be like sheesh

[Hook]
You ain't say nothing
That's alright
Your body say something
Let's talk all night, yeah
You ain't say nothing
That's alright
Your body say something
Let's talk all night
That body talk

[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, you got me on the line
And ooh baby, you got me makin' time, yeah
And ooh the temperature, it be on the rise
You got me sweatin' like it's time to hit a sauna
Be like oh oh oh
I spend my dough
On you, on you my girl
So pop it one time, slow-mo
Let's take a selca photo
We keep it secret, low-low
These other girls is so-so
You brought it out, my mojo, yeah, yeah
Baby you so M'm! (M'm!), like some Campbell Soup
