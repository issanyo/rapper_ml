[Intro]
I need a Cha Cha beat boy

[Verse 1]
Alright alright baby you’re the baddest
And you got me worked up ready to be a savage to ya
I’ve been waiting patiently for you to take it off
I know you didn’t come just to drink all of my cabernet
Hope what’s on my mind is on your mind
Just let it marinate
Don’t wanna waste no time
I know I wanna be inside, oh yeah
What I wanna do yeah
Wanna grab you by your booty
Hey girl let’s shoot a movie
Baby you know

[Hook: Jay Park]
Once we get started I can go on and on
And you’ll be hitting all them high notes featuring on my song
And it’s like duh duh duh doo
Me and you are music making duh duh duh doo
Sexual collaboration
Duh doo da doo
Duh da doo

Harmonizing with your body

[Verse 2: Cha Cha Malone]
Alright alright deeper than 10,000 leagues
But I’ma take you higher, higher than them Cali trees
I'mma be the one make you forget ’em all
All these niggas try to 1-up me
But you don’t take them calls

And you know I feel like a winner
Every time I’m on you babe, on you babe
Oh yeah

Wanna grab you by your booty, your booty
Lay it on me lay it on me, lay it on me

[Hook: Jay Park]
