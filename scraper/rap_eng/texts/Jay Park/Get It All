[Verse 1: Jay Park]
Tryna find my inner peace  like I'm Buddha
But i got these haters sticking to me like a tumor
Tryna pass this bread around the team like a rumor
Shoutout to the real
Amen
Hallelujah
Crowd full of camera phones
Everyone's a shoota
Old acquaintances acting like they never knew ya
There's a war brewing, everybody gotta suit up
Shout out to the real
Amen
Hallelujah
How long they gone' ignore us
We crossin' every border
When all these people meet me
They be like "it's my honor"
But I ain't' gone' judge
I stay away from the court rooms
No news on me breaking laws
I chill back like i'm so cool
What I don't do is some fake shit
I'm permanent and y'all make shift
Holy water when jay spit
Her cheeks blew up
That's a face lift
You know I put a smile on the face
Cop that ace cause we finna celebrate
Then we out like some ninjas without a trace
Let's get it poppin
Better keep up with my pace
We leavin' trails
We leadin' the movement
AOMG everyday
All day H1GHR MUSIC

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Yuh, yuh

Killing for really, I'm running all day, yeah i be grinding all day

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Killing for Rib√©ry, I don't mean literally
I'm more like the sin in me
Fuck all my enemies
No wait, let me pray
Positive energy
Let them see me smile
Let them see me shine
Let them see me style
Know that it's my time
Know i'm in my prime
Even though i ball
Always on my grind
Work from 9-9
I'm stepping
I'm spazzing like muscle contractions
I'm back with the vengeance, I'm stronger
I got the balls
Look at me
Look at me
Triple X tentacion
Jet Li, I'm the one
Official as it come
Know that I'm 2nd to none
Yes I am Asian but in this occasion
Boy I am not fake in the fuck
Oh no no
Look at me
Switch up flows
Look at me
Rip up shows
Look at them
Think they know
But wait up, they don't pay no attention to the haters
I'm poppin' off, honest to god
They at a loss of words for me cause I'm so off the wall

[Bridge: Jay Park]
Yuh, yuh
We put in work for the squad yuh
Yuh, yuh
We killed it til everybody pause yuh
Yuh, yuh
Until the day i fucking fall yeah
Yuh, yuh
Until the day we get it all yuh

[Verse 3: Cha Cha Malone]
We ain't' fucking around no more
I ain't' wasting no time no more
I'ma stack it all
I'ma bring you up with me
You know i won't give up on you
And trust i see it through
And it won't do a thing to change me
We gonna make it
We gonna take it

[Hook: Jay Park]
