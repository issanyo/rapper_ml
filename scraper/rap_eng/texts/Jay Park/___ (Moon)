[Chorus]
Girl you put me in the mood
To do some thangs to you
Right under the moon
I’ll be loving you
With this liquor in my body
Go all night long
Baby you ain’t gotta worry
I’ll stay hard cause you know

[Post-Chorus]
I’m lusting you
That’s the truth
Let’s stay cool
Baby you ain’t gotta worry
I’ll stay hard cause you know
I’m lusting you

[Bridge]
I look at your body yeah
I look at your soul
I wanna feel you up and down
Baby here we go
Welcome to my party
In our birthday suites
Your cake is so sweet baby
Its taste’s so good

[Chorus]
Girl you put me in the mood
To do some thangs to you
Right under the moon
I’ll be loving you
With this liquor in my body
Go all night long
Baby you ain’t gotta worry
I’ll stay hard cause you know

[Outro]
I’m lusting you
That’s the truth
Let’s stay cool
Baby you ain’t gotta worry
I’ll stay hard cause you know
I’m lusting you
