I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm right here next to you baby
Yeah

A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm right here next to you baby

[Verse 1]
Look
Every time in the morning
We fuckin' and yawnin'
I'll buy you the world
But time can't afford it
I appreciate you for being supportive
Girl you the bae but also the homie
You keep me in on a Friday night
Used to be at every party creepin'
Now I'm outta sight
Only thing that's real is me and you
That's what it's kinda like
Couple bottles of soju and we knock out like a Tyson fight
I was a liar
I wasn't right
Faithful didn't mean shit yeah
In my life yeah
But you turned it around
Turned that around oh
Got me workin' at this
Workin' at this hard
I gotta million things to lose
But I'd rather lose a million things instead of losing you
This my heart and soul
You can feel it in the booth
I've never been this way girl
And that the honest truth I swear

[Bridge]
Girl I swear
Oooh yeah

[Hook]
I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm right here next to you baby
(I'm right here next to you)
(girl, I'm right here next to you)
Yeah
I got a million things to do
A million things to prove
A million things to lose
But I'm right here next to you baby

And I'm witchu all night

Things instead of losing you
