[Verse 1: Jay Park]
Yea (GRAY)
I've always been a dream chaser
Shout out to Meek Mill
Since the day I was born I haven’t been able to sit still
Never weak-willed
Always been real
I risk lookin' soft to avoid situations where my homies could get killed
Small-minded petty shit
Somethin' we don’t entertain'
We do somethin' lame
Live and learn
Do it never again
Then we teach game to one another
Because you're all my brothers, my actions reflect y'all
So I never move like a sucker
I'm slipping, I'm falling I can't get up
I know you’ll catch me, support me and help me get up
Yea this bullshit
Whatever, I show nothin’ but love
Bitches, money, fame, it's cool but it means nothin’ above
So let's enjoy it while it lasts
With the smiles and the laughter
Comes sadness, all black
Up front, there's a pastor
To the hoes and bastards, the trolls and backstabbers
Never too late to change till you up in your casket
Let's get it

[Chorus: Shelby The Singer & Jay Park]
The god-blessed sky
Looked down at the earth
I need you, I need you right here
Are you down for the ride
Right next to me
For this legacy
I need you, I need you right here
For this thing called life

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Look, growth to me that’s all that matters
Life's a game of shoots and ladders
Ups and downs okay but I ain't movin' backwards
I don't fit in the propaganda
Try to anger me so I can do some crazy shit
I don't believe in atheist
They want you wound up until you say fuck the pace
And I filled a blacklist and Kaepernick
Coz he took a knee, what type of fuck shit is that?
And who do we trust?
Man, I ain't even black
I just think it's unjust
Can't stand up for your beliefs, nah, not in their house
Drastic measures, your family, they'll take food out of their mouth
In this society it's so easy to lose hope
Just know we got each other
Hold your hand through the smoke
Let's go
This that shit that they don't wanna see
It starts with you and me
Let's go
What you leave behind, use your energy
Yes, not just yours or mine man this our legacy, wassup

[Chorus: Shelby The Singer & Jay Park]
The god-blessed sky (sky)
Looked down at the earth (earth)
I need you, I need you right here (oh, I need you right here)
Are you down for the ride (baby)
Right next to me (me)
For this legacy (oh)
I need you, I need you right here
For this thing called life (ohh ah)

[Bridge: Shelby The Singer]
Who can I lean on when the world is on my shoulders
Baby, I need someone I can be with and grow older
Yea

[Verse 3: Gifted Gab]
Coz life is much cold and people can't hold us
Since Trump's been in office, it seems that we lost it
Take a look around
Now you seein' what it's cost us
People in positions of power really imposters
Using propaganda for profit
Then politicians put that paper in their back pocket
What's the difference between government and black market
They hate blacks but like the black market
Shooting blacks like we damn targets
That's not progress
They US been a mess
We just got conscious
Look, I'mma preach coz' it's never too late
We gotta teach fear is a direct descendant of hate
I'm a Moor, so I'm a direct descendant of greats
So when I perform, you listen and I hope you relate
Hey, I got a solid intuition, a lot of ambition
I'm looking at the world through a clear-cut vision

[Outro: Gifted Gab]
We gotta do better
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
I talk to Pop like he a friend of me
I gotta do this for my legacy
