[Verse 1: Jarv Dee]
I need a Cha Cha beat boy
Why you actin' funny
Like girl you never wanted me
Tryna' get the shade 'cause you see me plantin' these money trees
Now gotta pay the fee, you ain't gonna hussle me
Skippin' through these hard times
Tryna' ride luxury
Fuck that
I'll double tap your hood rats
All them compliments I said, I take back
You can go and keep that head
That mouth wack
I decline all your calls
No call back
Matter fact

[Pre-Hook: Jay Park]
You act like I don't know you, girl
Girl, why you actin' brand new
Yeah, it's frontin' I just can't do
You act like I don't know you

[Hook: Jarv Dee]
Girl, you playin'
Sayin' you don't know my name
But you only know my chain
Girl, you playin'
Sayin' you don't know my name
But you only know my chain
Girl, you playin'
Sayin' you don't know my name
But you only know my chain

Sayin' you don't know my name
But you only know my chain

[Refrain: Jarv Dee & Jay Park]
Why you playin'

[Verse 2: Gifted Gab]
Yuh, Yuh-
Wh- Why you wanna play with a nigga like me

Got your BD in the front seat of the C3

They wanna hitch the route
And we tell 'em bounce
To busy puttin' this money in different bank accounts

[Pre-Hook: Jay Park]
