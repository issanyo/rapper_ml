[Verse 1]
All I know is money right now
All I know is money right now
All I know is yo' booty in that tight dress
Nice legs
Friday night
Shit, it's looking lovely right now
I know nothin' 'bout that fake shit
Nothin' 'bout that fake shit
I know nothin' 'bout actin' brand new
To my crew
Yeah, it's all about the fam
And the homies I came up with, yeah yeah

All I know is positive vibes
No negative shit
Thank God I'm alive
I inspire the kids
Yeah, my whip is foreign
And my chick be callin'
And you know I stay fly
So my kicks be soarin', oh yeah
Let me flex one time
Just one time
Alright, I'm over that shit
Yeah, I'm over that shit
Man, look at the way I move
Man, they know what it is

What my purpose is

A few mil cool for now
'Cause I worked for this
But in time wanna be
Up in yo' mind redefine
How you lookin' at the world
And the way that shit is, ah yeah

Watch me
Don't worry I got this

[Verse 2]
Look
If you don't know
You about to find out
I mean every word out of my mouth
Workin' too hard to be underappreciated
I'm the same one even back
When they were hatin'
Move after move muthafucka
Is what we be makin'
Every day is our birthday
And we be cakin'
Cakin' (look)

But some see the vision now
And they try to creep around
But I ain't worried one bit
'Cause my mama wake up every mornin'
She be praying for me now
Look
My family too big
To take any days off
So we grinding like tomorrow is uncertain
'Cause the future isn't somethin' you can purchase
So we showin' out 'til they close the curtains

At times I wanna press rewind to a much simpler time, oh no
It's AOMG for life
Yeah, I'm always on my grind, oh no
Picking the other side
That's like suicide, oh no
But we about to let 'em all know
Muhfucka, let's go (woo)
Yeah

All I know is this fucking money
We made nothin' into something
One thing I do know for sure
Is I'ma be the one, yeah
Don't worry I got this
