[Verse 3: Raz Simone]
When I was just a youngin' I had only one
I was a virgin got a baby fuckin' only once
My momma said be careful child cause you my only son
You got a crazy life to live but you got only one
So I’m hittin these Joogs on the low
Keepin' my pole everywhere that I go
Snakes in this jungle around watchin' my steps
Buildin' relationships slow
People be fake for a while
But the more steps you get in all that fake shit’ll show
I keep that machete on me
Wackin' these weeds
Keepin' all of my grass low
Hit the block and then we mob out
Sleepin' I don’t know what that about
I’m from the district where them choppers out
I’m from the city they don’t talk about
Just hoppin out then we poppin' out
Even cops around they just chalk it down
