[Intro]
Your ass will go up and your face will go down
Gray

[Verse 1]
You don’t have to pack your bags
But where we about to go
It’s our little secrets Baby
Just for you to know oh
Oh oh oh
So get ready
Cause we're about to take off
Take off our clothes, uh uh
We don’t need no ticket for
Where we about to go
We can get there fast and
We can take it slow

[Hook]
We don’t need a car or train
Bus or plane
For where we about to go
All we need is you and me
Sex trip
Sex trip
Let’s go all night
Let’s go all night
Let go of your body and mine

[Verse 2]
Let’s go baby back and forth
I’d be falling from the sky Geronimo
We can go in around me Make you scream some more
Could be fucking like it’s my job And I make it do
Let our worlds collide girl
Ooh show me how you ride girl
We don’t need no ticket for
Where we about to go
We can get there fast and then
We can take it slow

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Your ass will go up and your face will go down
Get you to the bed and we lift it off the ground
Come into my world girl I’ll show you around
I’ll go downtown, you go downtown
X2

[Hook]

[Outro]
Your ass will go up
Get you to the bed
Come into my world
I’ll go downtown, you go downtown
