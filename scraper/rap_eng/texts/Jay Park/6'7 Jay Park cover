Infinite bars I'm a monster truck killing you cars
Black hole diminishing stars the kid pissing you off
I’m the missile the bomb explosives blowing hitting you hard
Never witnessed something so great probably think you've seen God
I’ll break your wrist and your arms hip ribs and your jaws
With a flick of my fist bitch kid mission accomp
Lished if you still live come back I’ll finish you off
Electrical current in the water and y'all fish in a pond
So dead and so gone fruit make you look like Eve and her hus
Band if my name was Steve you couldn't be taking my Job
Man I’m an innovator inspirator instigator, see you later
Sip your hatorade and make a drink it's called yellow flavor
The hottest product out and y'all be my buyer
Pass me out put me up all walls cause I'm flier
Though I changed your wheels before I’ll never get tired
I'm spitting shit that so hot I should probably get fired
Molded into greatness and no I am not PLAY-DOH
I am Popeye's spinach and y'all just couch potatoes
Make chips out you and and maybe put you in a bag
Cause y'all flow be garbage man looking like trash

I’m on the top your bottom cause y'all looking like ass
You must be a cigarette cuz yall lookin like
If you think your dope then maybe I will smoke you
No chip on your shoulder I will give you a broke tooth
Acting like a tree but we both know you got no roots
On the dance floor I get more funkier then old food
Yup, what I started doing just to try
Now I am no student art of movement till I die
I got some different shit in me oozin up inside
You'll be like man I wouldn't my losing to this guy

I be PS12 and y'all Nintendo the old
I got so many bars it's where I’m getting my gold
Y'all just sucky poker players destined to fold
All you boys to men this is the end of the road
Jacob from Twilight cause I go and be on beast mode
Eating mother fuckers because I go and be on feast mode
Raps a naked Eskimo and your flow be the least cold
If you don't like that there it's fuck you like I’m CEE-lo
It's not Friday but I’m debo
Get off the planet there's no room for my ego
I get it done and kick a punch this shit is just a minimum
I’m every super hero super villain all mixed in one
Man you know I mastered the craft kid you seen it
I'll take the apple off the back of your mac and eat it

You mistaken if you ever think Jay's soft
I’m from Nordstroms about to rip your retail off
In this game no ball involved no west east play offs
Just cuz I sing do not mean I’m a female dog
I’m that blue thing from xmen you tired than take a rest then
Like two stick I rub together a pad and a felt pen create fire so you melting raps is what I’m best in
Got your head bobbing like all of you are yes men
Like fish on my line taking the bait I place
I should change my name to Tom cuz you can’t take my space
Just moving along the lines man base by base
Until I hit home and make everyone say my name
I’m a lyrical miracle please don't take offense when I spit at you
It's like a ritual cause I’m gonna make you see my vision too
No vision when your vision's done like vision impaired listen son
I’m sharp off the top head looking like the Simpsons son
There are no janitors so my dome is a mess
Like my mom's name is Blessing I was born for success
No room to evolve here man I got the tightest style
I’m my own hardest critic I don't need no Simon Cowell

My time is now
Ok I'm gonna milk it like a cow
Give y'all black eyes like boom boom boom to the pow suckah

Ok lemme double time this shit

I ain't never gonna fail I’ve lost it now
Better send me to jail I’m the problem child
Make cheddar all day at stack the piles
I’m gonna prevail suckah Spartan style
The king of the castle Dumbledore
Don't got no more steps left to stumble more
Continue fight in this rumble yo
Till my heart can not pump no more
Never had a kid made it look this easy
Breezy like them cover girl beezies
Voice that’ll make them girls feel freaky
Dance like them crews on ABDC
So incredible give you the heebie geebies
Nobody be saying that he be greedy
All for the fam man see me beasting
Give you nightmares if you feeling sleepy
