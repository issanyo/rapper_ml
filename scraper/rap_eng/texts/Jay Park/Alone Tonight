[Hook: Jay Park]
(Woogie on and on)
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
So can you come with me
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
Can you keep me company
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
So can you come with me
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
Can you keep me company

[Verse 1: Jay Park]
I don’t wanna be alone tonight (No)
Just got done with a show tonight (Makin' makin' money)
So much goin' on in my life
I don’t know if I’m wrong or right
I got mofuckas prayin' prayin' I fall
Women women that wanna take my dough
But I’m focused focused I don’t notice notice
I’m still glowing, glowing, look at me ball
Ballin' like Lebron, I’m the king
I won’t ever quit I put that on everything
My name's known worldwide
But I still need someone by my side
Oh baby are you down to ride
Lemme know

[Hook: Jay Park]
I don’t gotta lotta time, cause
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
So can you come with me
I don’t wanna be alone to night
Can you keep me company
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
So can you come with me
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
Can you keep me company

[Verse 2: Sik-K]
Ay ay you don’t bring your man here
아주 좋아 오늘은 내가 네 애인이야
Ay ay ay let me let me spend my paper
뭘 하고 싶은지는 I ain’t gotta mention
Maybe, maybe you can spend your time on me
난 너랑 자꾸하러 같이 갈래 자고실로
네 Double D가 대신 대답하지 씰룩
몇 시간만 지나면 네 몸은 see-through
I don’t want no lonely nights
I can do you proper
어서 맘을 정해 난 시간이 많진 않아
Don’t want no lonely nights ay
Baby you're my type
You don’t want no lonely nights
You gon love this pipe yah

[Hook: Jay Park]
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
So can you come with me
I don’t wanna be alone to night
Can you keep me company
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
I don’t wanna be alone tonight

[Verse 3: Jay Park]
I be workin' workin' workin', getting no sleep
So my momma worried worried worried 'bout me
I’m tryna put whole team on we hustlin', we grindin' all day
Like Kanye like we got none to eat
Time be flying by I’m the kinda guy
Riding for my side it’s a homicide
When I’m on the mic they just cry and cry
We couldn’t see eye to eye if you were goliath height
I’m all the way the up oh
I’m not tryna fuck no
I just wanna love you
It’s that turn down
Sip some Henny in yo room now
Netflix is soundin' real coo now
Resting my head right on u now
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
I don’t wanna be alone tonight
