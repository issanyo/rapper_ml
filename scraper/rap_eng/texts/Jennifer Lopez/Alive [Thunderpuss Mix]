[Verse 1]
Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive, hmm
