[Intro]
(Woo, woo) I was
(Woo, woo) I was
(Woo, woo) I was
(Woo, woo) I was

[Verse 1]
Break it, you buy it, nothing's for free
Especially my body, especially me
Break it, you bought it, I pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Verse 2]
Break it, you buy it, this one's on me
Don't start a riot, don't cause a scene
Start up a fire, pray that you don't (Ooh, ooh)
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do

[Pre-Chorus]
First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (Oh)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

[Bridge]
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
You should've took your time, should've took your time (When you had me, baby)
You should've took your time
Did it right when you had me, baby
But you was playing games, all those love charades

[Chorus]
You wanna take it but I won't give it away (Oh)
Leave me in a mess I never made (No)
Tryna play a game I never learned (Oh)
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over
