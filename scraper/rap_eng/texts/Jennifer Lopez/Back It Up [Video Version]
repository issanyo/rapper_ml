Oh yeah
Yo, it's got that dancehall feel to it

Mr. Worldwide
Take over, that's right

[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
Girl, your body is timeless, yeah
Girl, your body got me like
Oh, my gosh; oh, my god
Oh mama
And you're makin' me earn it, yeah
Girl, you're makin' me earn it
Oh, my gosh; oh, my god
Oh mama

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Ain't nothin' fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Try playin' cool
But can't help how I feel

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Tu me dejas sin aire (Yeah!)
Tu me tienes a mi like
Oh my gosh, oh my God (Oh mama)
Esto no tiene nombre (Yeah!)
Say it over and over
Oh my gosh, oh my God (Oh mama)

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Ain't nothing fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Try playin' cool
But can't help how I feel

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)

[Bridge: Pitbull & J.Lo]
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Damn, you're sexy
Boom boom, daddy daddy daddy
Damn, you're fine
Boom boom, mami mami mami
You on fire
Boom boom, daddy daddy daddy
Let's ride

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Now back it up
Push your booty out
Move it in
Move it out
Now wind it up
While I grind it up
Like a twenty sack
And roll it out

[Verse 4: Pitbull]
You can go anywhere in the world
And you know that they know about me (know about me)
I don't think you really wanna ask your girl
If she knows anything about me
Nah nah nah, you don't
Word of advice: want a happy life?
Don't look for what you don't want to find
But before your boyfriend finds out
Back it up one more time
Dale

[Interlude: Prince Royce]
Dámelo mami chula
Dámelo mami chula

So back, back, back it up

[Chorus: Royce & J.Lo & Pitbull]
You love it when I drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)
I turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo)(Baby back it up)
(Dámelo papi chulo)(Baby back it up)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo)
