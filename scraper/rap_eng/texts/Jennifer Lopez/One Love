[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Took a shot with the bad boy from the block
And picked my love right from the start
Mister wrong, he plays his part
Back to the beginning, now round two
Try my luck with something new
We danced until we said "I do"
My luck is bad, no more us two
No me and you (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
It's take three, could there be a part for me?
Came and swept me off my feet
Went nowhere, but kept the ring
Once again, I'm lonely
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure
So worn out, but love just saw
Made me want to try once more
And I couldn't say no (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last?

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
What's wrong with the girl wanting everything?
Good love, real trust, true meaning, oh
Who truly completes me?
I'm good on my own, but I have to know

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love (Oh), somebody that compliments me (Oh)
And makes me want to never leave? (Oh)
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
