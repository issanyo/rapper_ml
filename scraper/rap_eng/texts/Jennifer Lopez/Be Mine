[Verse 1]
Looking through a coffee table book
At a small cafe on Broadway
Trying to find a way out of all trouble and dismay
Traveling on a road unpaved
Everywhere I look there's something there to remind me
Of feelings from yesterday
Listening to drama and hearsay only leaves me empty

[Pre-Chorus]
(But when I think of you)
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
I want you to be mine

[Verse 2]
Turn the music up, riding on the highway
Thinking about the way that I feel when I'm with you
A feeling that continues to make me feel good
Even when I'm not near you, and I want it to stay
Emotions, I have so many
Love can give you plenty, but I know

[Pre-Chorus]
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (Can't you see?)
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart (Look into your heart)
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (Before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Bridge]
Everything he does, all of the above
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
Fits me like a glove, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (I want you to be mine)
Everything he does, fits me like a glove
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
All of the above, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Hasn't been done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (No)
No one loves you more than me (More than me)
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Outro]
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine
Oh, oh, oh, be mine
