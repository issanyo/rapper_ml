[Intro: Prince Royce]
What's up, baby?
It's your new boyfriend
Royce

[Intro: Pitbull]
Oh yeah
You know, this got that dance hall feel to it
Prince Royce
Mr. Worldwide
Takeover, that's right

[Verse 1: Prince Royce]
Girl, your body is timeless, yeah
Girl, your body got me like
Oh, my gosh; oh, my gah
Oh mama
And you're making me earn it, yeah
Oh, you're making me earn it
Oh, my gosh; oh, my gah
Oh mama

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Ain't nothing fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Tried playing cool
But can't help how I feel

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)

[Verse 2: Prince Royce]
Oh, I wish I was stronger, yeah
But you're making it harder
Oh, my gosh; oh, my gah
Oh mama
And you make me go loco, yeah
Say it over and over
Oh, my gosh; oh, my gah
Oh mama

[Pre-Chorus: Prince Royce]
Ain't nothing fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Tried playing cool
But can't help how I feel

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Damn, you sexy
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Damn, you fine
Boom boom, mami mami mami
You on fire
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Let's ride

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Now, back it up
Put your booty out
Move it in, Move it out
Now wind it up, While I grind it up
Like a 20 sack, and roll it out
You can go anywhere in the world
And you know that they know about me
I don't think you really wanna ask that girl
If she knows anything about me
Nah, nah, you don't
Word of advice: want a happy life?
Don't look for what you don't wanna find
But before your boyfriend finds out
Back up it one more time
Dale

[Interlude: Prince Royce]
Dámelo mami chula
Dámelo mami chula
(Dámelo papi chulo) Yeah
(Dámelo papi chulo)
So back, back, back it up

[Chorus: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)

[Outro: Prince Royce]
I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
(Dámelo papi chulo, dámelo papi chulo)
