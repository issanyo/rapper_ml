[Intro]
Redone, J.Lo

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid
So why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby
So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

[Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life, this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

[Verse 2]
Baby, your fire is lighting me up
The way that you move boy is reason enough
That I love to make love to you, baby
I can't behave
Oh, I want you so much
Your lips taste like heaven, so why should I stop?
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

[Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life, this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Let's do it loud
And make it last
'Cause baby, nothing should matter tonight
Lets do it loud, and make it last
'Cause baby, nothing should matter tonight
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
Only got just one life, this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say
(Let's do it, do it, do it)
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
I wanna dance, and love, and dance again
