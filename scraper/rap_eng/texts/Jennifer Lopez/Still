[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
When I sleep  I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'Bout the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met, oh, how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town, you and me
Whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
How it hurts to not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Verse 2]
A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me (Oh, oh)
Didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (Sorry)
And I'm sorry, baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Bridge]
All of the good times we had together (Together)
Do they mean something to you?
Do you ever wish we never split?
'Cause I still got love for you

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you (Gave my heart to you)
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you (There's other men than you)
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one
Still, I still got love for you (Still got love)
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you (I love you)
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one
