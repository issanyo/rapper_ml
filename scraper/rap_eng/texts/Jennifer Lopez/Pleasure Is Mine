[Intro]
Ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
Baby relax, we've been waiting for this
And we deserve the heavenly bliss
That waits underneath the stars above
Can't you hear them begging us, "Let's make love"?
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul
Right here in this room the truth unfold

[Refrain]
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Delaying the divine

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (Oh-oh), let me give some to you
We can take our time (Take our time), nothing I'd rather do (Oh, no)
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever)
Remember (Remeber) the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine

[Verse 2]
Everyday I've been dreaming about how
It's gonna be to find you out
To be sharing your kiss, to be just like this
What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips
So let's not waste one second more
Let's cut the lights and let's lock the door

[Refrain]
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Delaying the divine

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (Yeah), let me give some to you (To you)
We can take our time (Take our time, yeah), nothing I'd rather do (Oh, no)
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever)
Remember (Remeber) the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, I don't wanna breathe (I don't wanna)
Don't wanna change a single vibe (Don't wanna)
Nobody else I'd rather see (Nobody else)
When you're like this before my eyes
Wanna be everything you need
Keep you satisfied
I'm praying (I'm praying), stop playing (Stop playing)
Is saying (Saying), stop playing (Playing)
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine (All mine, yeah), let me give some to you
We can take our time (Take our time, yeah), nothing I'd rather do (Rather do)
To make you feel fine (Fine), to make your life shine (Shine)
Give you moments you can treasure forever (Forever, forever)
Remember (Remeber, remember) the pleasure is mine

[Outro]
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine
Let me give some to you (The pleasure is mine)
We can take our time, mine, mine, all mine
Nothing I'd rather do
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Let me give some to you (Feel fine, make your life shine)
We can take our time, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
Nothing I'd rather do
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
Let me give some to you (The pleasure is mine)
We can take our time, mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine
Nothing I'd rather do
