[Intro]
You're perfect

[Verse 1]
I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak
So deep our bodies meet, I had to have you

[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

[Verse 2]
I think God made you for me
A mix of passionate fidelities
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king

[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy
