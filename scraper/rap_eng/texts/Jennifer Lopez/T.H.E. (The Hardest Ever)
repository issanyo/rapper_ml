[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[Verse 1: Will.i.am]
I'ma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfucking liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorean doors
Willy survive, never deceased
I don't think I'ma ever gon' rest in peace
I'ma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipes
Tell a jealous chicken
I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grankids' nieces
I'ma work hard, that's my thesis
This beat is the shit, feces (Uh)
Pardon me ma'am, I'ma go dumb
Smart.i.am, I'm complicated, Hard.i.am
I end the beginning, then start it again

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Refrain: will.i.am]
Ooh, ooh
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Ooh, ooh
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[Verse 2: Will.i.am]
You can get that, or you can get this
You can call a demon, I'ma call Jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work, or you could be the boss
I'ma be the owner, be a thought donor
I'ma go hard, like a motherfuckin' boner
I'ma make the beat put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner (Uh)
I woke up in the morning
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. own the mic, phone the homeland (Uh)
I wait out like NASA
I'm way over here, I done past ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews
I go hard, statues (Uh)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & will.i.am]
Now let me take this time to say
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it is a lot to take
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
Ooh, ooh
Wait a minute, I'ma make it a little harder
I'ma make it a little harder
Give it to you a little harder
This is hard

[Interlude: will.i.am]
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh

[Verse 3: Mick Jagger]
Hard like a rock 'n roll
Time bomb's ticking, explode
Baby, this is dynamo
Better move back now, it's 'bout to blow
Hard like geometry, and trigonometry
This is crazy, psychology
Get it, baby, I'm 'bout to win
Watch out now, I'm going in

[Chorus: Mick Jagger]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
