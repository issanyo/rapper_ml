[Intro]
I've been

[Verse 1]
All I need is a place to be and a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts and find a way to show
What I feel and if this is real, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Verse 2]
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong
Or if it's just about me all along
All I need is time to search within my soul
So I can share a deeper part of me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?

[Bridge]
Baby, what's meant to be (What's meant to be)
Will surely be (Will surely be, baby)
(If you love me, baby, you would understand)
But I can't give you anything (Can't give you anything)
I don't have myself to give (Don't have myself to give)
And it's killing me inside

[Chorus]
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?
I've been thinkin' (Thinkin')
You've been on my mind (On my mind)
So I've been praying (Praying)
To find a way that I (A way that I)
Can be sure, the way that (The way that)
You've been sure with me (Sure with me)
Don't you want that for me?
