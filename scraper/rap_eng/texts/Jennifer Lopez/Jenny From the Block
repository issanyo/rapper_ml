[Intro: Sample]
Children grow and women producing
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
BX, uh (Southside Bronx)
(Southside Bronx)

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)

[Verse 1]
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don't hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)

[Verse 2]
I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (Real)
To me it's like breathing, yeah (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Bridge: Sample]
South Bronx, oh, the Southside Bronx
F-F-F-Flip it
Boricua
Now that's what happened
South Bronx, the Southside Bronx
Ah
F-F-F-Flip it
Now that's what happened
South Bronx, the Southside Bronx
Boricua's in the house
F-F-F-Flip it
Now that's what happened
Hey
South Bronx, the Southside Bronx
Everyone's got to make a living
Alright, now bring it back

[Chorus]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)
