[Verse 1]
I know better than anybody how it feels
To want somebody so bad after you break up
Still looking for that phone call
Still, even when they don't call
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over
Act like you wasn't listening when they told you
They don't want to be with you anymore
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

[Verse 2]
You don't want to believe it but you see it happening
Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having
Still looking for his return
Still hoping that he's gonna learn
Wake up, and realize the truth
Make some time for you
What is he trying to do to you?
Miss him more as days go by
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

[Bridge]
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
He'll be back, thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
