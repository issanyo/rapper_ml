Let’s hit the sweet spot away, way, way

Let’s hit the sweet spot away, way, way

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna take you back to my spot
You can be the candy girl in my shop
We both know what we craving, why not?
Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl you know, I run a love game, never play uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the 2 door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kissed the milky way and bring to life your fantasies
As we hit them up so make cool a
Touch them to make the seas split 2 ways
You’re in love with that too girl, don’t play
I’m just waiting to hear you say

Uh, don’t you get me started, hit the after party
All the night, to a rave to freak that I take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
And yeah mama I’m the king of these kicks, gotta love it
If you want it you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubber that I’m touching

So pack a luggage and let’s let’s...
