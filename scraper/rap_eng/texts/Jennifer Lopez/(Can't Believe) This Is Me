[Verse 1]
How can you just say that you love me, yet to leave you alone?
You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it, love? Can I help you?
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to
I've looked to you enough

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Verse 2]
Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say
And the only thing that you could have done, you choose to walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thankful, love, I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through
I needed you somehow

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
I can't believe this is me
I was a fool to believe you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me?
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
