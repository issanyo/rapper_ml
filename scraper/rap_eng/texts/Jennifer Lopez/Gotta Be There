[Intro]
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh? (Oh)
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 1]
I remember I said we should split
Had a lot going on and you weren't part of it
You trying to reason with me, I admit, but I did
And now I'm walking around so, so sick
And now I'm fiending, for you that's a fact
Got me missing you like L.A. misses Shaq
What I got to do, on my mission to get you back
'Cause I'm just that whack without you, oh baby, baby, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it when I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping, flipping out it was some nonsense (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was on a whole 'nother level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was trying to push you away, really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case (Oh baby, baby, I)
It was just plain crazy 'cause 'round here lately
Been thinking 'bout nothing but my baby

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
(Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Hanging out in the M.I.A
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Maybe you can be in L.A
(Baby, I gotta be there)
I just wanna be your lady
(Baby, I gotta be there)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh? (Oh)
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 2]
What's done is done, and I want to take it back
I'm not living in the past, 'cause, but now I want you back
Got to get you, got to get you here
I been looking for you everywhere
Everywhere, baby
I'll apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove, prove
Baby, I'm wrong and out of breath
From being around the world trying to get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it when I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping, flipping out it was some nonsense (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was on a whole 'nother level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was trying to push you away, really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case (Oh baby, baby, I)
It was just plain crazy 'cause 'round here lately
Been thinking 'bout nothing but my baby

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
(Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Hanging out in the M.I.A
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Maybe you can be in L.A
(Baby, I gotta be there)
I just wanna be your lady
(Baby, I gotta be there)

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Bridge]
Damn, come back to me
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh? (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)

Baby, I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?
