[Verse 1]
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights (The lights)
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright (So bright)
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside (Outside)
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Verse 2]
Out through the back (The back)
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Bridge]
Can you hang onto a shooting star? (Star)
Handle distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
'Cause I'll be running home right back to you

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Outro]
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
