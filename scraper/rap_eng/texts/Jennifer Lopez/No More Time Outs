[KAREN]
Stop! Put your hands in the air! Jack, I know you're up there!

[JACK]
Shit!

[KAREN]
Where's Kenneth?

[JACK]
He's up here. He's dead

[KAREN]
Come on, Jack. Don't

[JACK]
Pretend it's not me

[KAREN]
You think I'd shoot you?

[JACK]
If you don't, somebody else will

[KAREN]
Put the gun down

[JACK]
I'm not going back

[KAREN]
Jack, please don't make me do this. Put the gun down

[JACK]
No more time outs
