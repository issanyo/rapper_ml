[Intro: Jennifer Lopez]
Do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
Uh, uh, uh, uh, woo!
Woo! Woo!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Here's the thing
I was minding my own business, doing what I do
I wasn't tryna look for anything
All of a sudden, couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn't even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze, saying, "What the hell?"
Here's my name, number, baby, just hit my cell
Loving everything you do 'cause you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinking

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
You ain't even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good, and you so fine
Got me saying crazy things, listen

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
Oh, yeah, hey, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Let me tell you how it's gonna go
You and me gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no Do-Si-Do
I need a one woman man seven days a week
Quit tryna play it cool, boy, make your move
I told you how it is, nothing to lose
You been staring over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me, boy

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
You ain't even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good, and you so fine
Got me saying crazy things, listen

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda!)
Can't nobody do it quite like me (Nope)
Hit it just right through the night, like me (Nope)
Have 'em out of sight and invite like three (Hey)
To hit the night life they say, "Ay papi!" (Woo!)
Ay mami, it's nice to meet ya (Ha!)
Me gustan hermosas señoritas (Ha!)
I love how you shake your distinctive features (Hey)
My name's Ludacris, and I'd like to freak it
They say, "No parar," do it again
And you know me, so I'm like, "Muy bien"
I'm the numero uno (What?), rico hombre
Baby, feel this and, grita mi nombre (Luda!)
Toda la noche, know you won't say
Skip the fo'play, sip some Rosé (Woo!)
Either that or some Veuve Clicquot
And on that note, adios amigos, bye bye

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, no need for false pretenses (Hey)
I think you just shocked me to my senses (Yeah)
Everything that you do feels right (Ooh)
Do it, do it, do it, do it all night
Baby, no need for false pretenses (I know what you're thinking)
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right ('Cause I'm thinking it too, babe)
Do it, do it, do it, do it all night

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cause you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No, like that)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No, like that)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No, I know, what you're thinking)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No, 'cause I'm thinking it too, babe)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
'Cause you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
