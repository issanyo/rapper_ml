[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Rock your body, rock your body
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh...
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow
I make sure everybody knows

[Bridge]
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi
Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Mo-move)

[Chorus]
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body
Llégale, llégale
Suéltate el pelo
Levántate, cae y asegúralo
Ve con todo
Si él es lo máximo, azota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh)
