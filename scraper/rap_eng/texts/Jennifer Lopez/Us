[Vesre 1]
Is this a warning?
My heart beatin' on an offbeat
Is this a caution
That I can't get enough for your need?

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

[Chorus]
Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

[Post-Chorus]
Could it be us?

[Verse 2]
I'm right here
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Could you be the one without a doubt?
Could I be for your keepin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

[Chorus]
Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

[Post-Chorus]
Could it be us?

[Chorus]
Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

[Post-Chorus]
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)
