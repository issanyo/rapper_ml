[Verse 1]
Strangers always got some mess to spread
But I have learned to flick them off (Them off)
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs
I strap 'em on and I walk it off (It off)

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Verse 2]
My strut's so fierce
Steven's got 'em mad at me
Laugh and talk behind my back
But they'll never get the best of me
I see 'em doing my dance
And I hear 'em singing my song
I'm surpassing the rest
'Cause that's how I was raised to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Bridge]
I'm walking tall
I don't let their hatred test me
They bite the dust, head above water
They still can't breathe
My feet pound the ground as I stomp it out
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
