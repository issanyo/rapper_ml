[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 1]
The way you looked at me tells me you're sorry
You walked by me whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay, instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me, let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me, just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me with those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 2]
The way you tricked me you know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it but all we did was fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight, we got to compromise
Baby, talk to me and tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me and let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me and everything will be alright
But we must communicate, tomorrow it could be too late

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out (Talk to me, baby)
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you, boy, and I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about what we could miss
It makes me want to lose my mind
Talk to me
Come on, come on, come on
Talk to me
Oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, come on
Make me wanna dream, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby, talk to me, baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm, together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, talking to you, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, baby, talking to you, baby)

[Outro]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about
