[Intro: Pitbull]
From the streets of Miami, to presenting at the GRAMMYs
Con el amulet de Jennifer, maybe now you understand me
Mr. Worldwide, RedOne, and the beautiful Jennifer Lopez
Dale
We don't believe in defeat
That's why we're back for a three-peat

[Verse 1: Pitbull & Jennifer Lopez]
Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco
Yo me lo como como pastelito coco
I get stupid on a beach, she wowo
I got Mamí, Mamís by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne, y ella el mojo
I'm saying dale, she's screaming YOLO
She's little Red Riding Hood
And guess who's the lobo? Me la como
Who's name is globally known?
Who's name's on a check, and they adding an O?
Who's name is on the blimp with the world is yours?
Who's name is on schools, huh? Slam for sure
I know it's hard to understand how a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand, but guess what? Here I am
Jenny From the Block, let's rock
You push me harder, I'll do the same
Boy, I want to feel you in every way
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We rocking body-to-body, let's go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Intelude: Pitbull]
Make love, don't fight, let's hook tonight

[Beat Break]

[Pitbull]
Let's hook tonight

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Turn up this mother and let it play
I know you like my bumper, don't be ashamed
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We're rocking body-to-body, let's go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Interlude: Pitbull]
Make love, don't fight, let's hook tonight

[Beat Break]

[Pitbull]
Let's hook tonight

[Bridge: Pitbull]
You name it, she's done it
She's the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me

[Breakdown]
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Outro + Beat Break: Pitbull]
Let's hook tonight
Let's hook tonight
