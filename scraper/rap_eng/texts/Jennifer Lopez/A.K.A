[Intro: Jennifer Lopez]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Can you hear me now?

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
This is not the girl you used to know
Talking to you now
I don't think you want me to explode
It's a countdown

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
It took you too long to find out
What you want right now
I'm too gone to stay around
Switching up my style

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now I'm Mrs. Never-Stick-Around, A.K.A
Never hold you down, A.K.A
Can't figure me out, A.K.A
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now
A.K.A, A.K.A
Oh, oh, oh
You don't know me now, A.K.A
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
(In space)
They always seem to want you when you go
I was here, oh, I was here before
What goes around, comes back around for sure
So I'ma let you, I'ma let you know, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
It took you too long to find out
What you want right now
I'm too gone to stay around
Switching up my style

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now I'm Mrs. Never-Stick-Around, A.K.A
Never hold you down, A.K.A
Can't figure me out, A.K.A
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now
A.K.A, A.K.A
Oh, oh, oh
You don't know me now, A.K.A
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now

[Verse 3: T.I. & Jennifer Lopez]
(Ay, ay)
Ay, what it is now shawty? (Yeah, what it is?)
You was fuckin' with a sucker but you dealin' with a real now shawty (For real)
Anybody got a problem, they can feel my .40 (Brap)
Tell me how you feel now, shawty (How you feel?)
Goddamn (Uh-huh), is you as good as you look? (Ay)
Standin' in the hood but, you look like you came off the page of a book
Pretty face and your ass off the hook (Skrrt!)
In the rain, like a crab when I look (What that?)
Whew, you are such a distraction
You act like you want it, I give you the business (I will)
Tear that shit up, girl, as God as my witness (I will)
Would you bend if you don't know me? (What?)
Honey, I'm considered your OG
Bitch don't like life â€˜cause you don't want me
Think you could do better? Well we sure gon' see (Okay)
Hold up, back in '04, try, you don't know me (I did)
The moral of the story, you, you don't know me (Ay)
Got there right now, I'm the man right now
Anybody get it, we can get it in right now (Yup)
Listen one thing still in the pen right now (What?)
Kill your gun, take your cell, I'd be dead by now (Oh, yeah)
But stare right now, get bread like wow (Ay, ay, ay)
When the drop hit, now get head like oww (Hahaha)
We let that A.K. go by JLo, don't get it twisted
You don't know me now, oh, you don't know me now
Hustle Gang over everything, brother

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & T.I.]
It took you too long to find out (G.D.O.D., do or die)
What you want right now (It's the king, bitch!)
I'm too gone to stay around (Uh-huh)
Switching up my style (Play with it, no million dollars)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & T.I.]
Now I'm Mrs. Never-Stick-Around, A.K.A (Tell 'em, tell 'em)
Never hold you down, A.K.A (Tell 'em, okay)
Can't figure me out, A.K.A (Tell 'em! Okay)
You don't know me now (Tell 'em, tell 'em), oh, you don't know me now (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
A.K.A (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em), A.K.A  (Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em)
Oh, oh, oh
You don't know me now, A.K.A
You don't know me now (Ayy, tell 'em), oh, you don't know me now (Tell 'em, ay, ay, yeah)
