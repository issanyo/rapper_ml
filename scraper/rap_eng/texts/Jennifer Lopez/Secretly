[Intro]
It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
Secretly (I'm so crazy)
I'm wanting you (I don't know what to do)
And I'm hoping you want me too (I gotta work it out to tell you)
I smell your scent (Tell you how I feel) across the room (When I see you)
And I can't wait to get next to you (My heart feels like it's gonna explode)

[Verse 1]
Whatever I see (When I look at you across the room)
Whatever I hear (I wonder if he notice me too)
Whatever I do (I just think about you for hours)
Oh, baby, and it's got me thinking of you (It's crazy)

[Chorus]
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (You look so good to me)
I smell your scent across the room (So sexy, damn)
And I can't wait to get next to you (Do I look sexy to you?)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you speak (Haha)
Whenever you move (That's what I think about)
Whenever you breathe (That's just the way I feel)
Baby, let me touch you (I don't know) please

[Chorus]
Secretly (I need to tell you)
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (I got a thing with you)
I smell your scent across the room (Do you see me?)
And I can't wait to get next to you ('Cause I see you)
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (It's crazy)
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

[Outro]
You smell so good
I just wanna kiss you
I wanna lay with you
I don't know how to tell you
