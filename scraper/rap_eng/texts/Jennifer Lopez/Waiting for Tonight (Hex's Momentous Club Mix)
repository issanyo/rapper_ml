[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight
