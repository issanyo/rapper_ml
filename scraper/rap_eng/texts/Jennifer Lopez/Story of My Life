[Verse 1]
Your relation to me
Feeds my empty existence
I guess I choose what to see
Because I’m feeling resistance
So turn the lights on below
The time we have is too precious
You say that you’ll never go
I know that lying is infectious now
So don’t let me down

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I thought you were ready to be
The start of my happy ending
Sometimes I choose what to see
Forget what I’ve been defending

Before the day fades to day
There comes a break in the weather
I made you say goodbye
Because I can’t say forever, now
So don’t let me down, no

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Bridge]
One in a million
But if you are ready to listen
I know that I can be stubborn
Maybe it’s me but I’ve been too blind to see

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Outro]
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
That’s the story of my life
