[Intro: Pitbull]
It's Mr. Worldwide
With the J to the L (O-O-O-O-O)
Jenny, let me talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
If you think it's a joke, go 'head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school, just not with my class
I'm like Einstein, I created my math
Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made 'em numbers, right?
Will you evaluate? Jennifer, baby, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies, working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there, motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there, innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power, meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
I see you, baby, getting your hair done, getting your nails tight
I see you, baby, trying on different outfits
Making sure they fit right
I see you, baby, getting ready for the night
Making sure you look right
I see you, baby
I see you, baby

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & (Pitbull)]
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)
La da da da de
Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)
La da da da de (Can't stop the beat)
Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Go, go, go, go, go, go go)
(Talk to me)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now its time to celebrate

[Chorus / Outro: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
(Monday, party, Tuesday, party, Wednesday, party)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
(Thursday, party, Friday, party, Saturday, party, Sunday, party, everyday, party)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
(Everyday, party)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
(Everyday, party)
