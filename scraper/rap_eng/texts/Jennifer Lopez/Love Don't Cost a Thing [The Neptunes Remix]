[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Intro: Ghostface Killah *during Chorus*]
Ghostface, dollar, dollars

[Jennifer Lopez]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you ought to know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

[Chorus 2: Jennifer Lopez]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma' you always kept it real
You been had a Benz way before I got this deal
I know its not about the money, the ropes or the missed stones
The leather, platinum rings and summer b-tones
They say we fled from the cameras, boo
Plus they found a hammer and ordered to trap me off
They must question you, say Jenny, shh, look me dead in my eyes
You tellin me that I don't love you boo, that wouldn't be wise
We whine in the best cuisines, Italian restaurants
Big lobster dishes wit Trump, this how come I feel for you
Sweetheart I'll kill for you
Shockin secrets revealed and my will goes to you
So stop all the yellin, Jennifer calm down
We need classed, guidance counsellors to calm us down
A grown man and stand as a man of my word
You see here? Look at her, all these bitches is birds

[Chorus 2 - 2X]

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Eh-yo ma', you know you the realest
It's real right now, ya heard?
It's like they ain't got nothin to kill right now
It's like e'rything gon' be a'ight
You watch and see

[Jennifer Lopez (Ghostface Killah)]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart (I got it ma')
I think you need to take some time (Indeed)
To show me that your love is true (It is)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart
(I got it ma', I got it ma')

[Chorus - 2X]
