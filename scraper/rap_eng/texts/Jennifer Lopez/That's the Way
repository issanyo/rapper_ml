[Intro: Darkchild]
Uh-huh, yeah
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez
Let's dance

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I know you see me watching
Although you're tryna play it
Like you don't (Don't)
When I know you do (Do)
You've got the every want thing
That kind of every need thing
You're what I want (Want)
So come give it up, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I won't stop until I get what I want (What I want)
So what am I to do?
'Cause what I want is you (Baby, all I want is you)
Baby, stop and think (Yeah)
What you and I could be (I could be)
Together, I know we (I know we) can be perfectly complete (So, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I can give you anything (Give you all my love)
If you promise to be with me (Yes, I can)
I promise I can make you happy
'Cause that's the way our love should be (And it ain't nobody)
No one could love you better anyway (Not like me)
You'll never find another close to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Why are you tryna deny
Me of the loving that's mine?
Just let it go (Go)
Let me take control ('Trol)
Boy, I got just what you want
And all the love you need
Once you grab a hold (Hold)
You won't let me go (Go), no

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I won't stop (I won't stop) until I get what I want (Everything I need)
So what am I to do? (What am I to do?)
'Cause what I want is you (When all I want is you)
Baby, stop and think (Oh, no)
What you and I could be (What we could be)
Together, I know we can be perfectly complete (Perfectly complete, baby)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I can give you anything (I can give you all)
If you promise to be with me (Yes, I can)
I promise I can make you happy (I know)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Our love should be)
No one could love you better anyway (Ooh, oh)
You'll never find another close to me (Not quite like me)
I promise I can make you happy (Oh)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Baby)
Baby, I can give you anything (Anything you want from me)
If you promise to be with me (Please stay with me)
I promise I can make you happy (Oh, oh)
That's the way our love should be (Woah, oh)
No one could love you better anyway (Haha, haha)
You'll never find another close to me
I promise I can make you happy
'Cause that's the way our love should be

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Darkchild]
If I let my actions speak (Yeah)
I guarantee you believe (Believe)
How much I really do love you (How much I do love you)
If I could spend my whole life (Spend my life, yeah)
Just looking into your eyes
I'll be happy just knowing you're with me (You're with me, my love)
Yeah, uh

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Darkchild]
Baby, I can give you everything (Anything)
If you promise to be with me (Yeah, be with me)
I promise I can make you happy (Shake it, shake it)
'Cause that's the way our love should be (Said you should be with me, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it)
No one could love you better anyway (Baby, yeah)
You'll never find another close to me (Shake it)
I promise I can make you happy (Jennifer)
'Cause that's the way our love should be, baby (Darkchild, come on)
Baby, I can give you anything (Ooh, baby)
If you promise to be with me (Ooh, baby)
I promise I can make you happy (Ooh)
'Cause that's the way our love should be
No one could love you better anyway (You should be loving me)
You'll never find another close to me ('Cause you'll find no one like me)
I promise I can make you happy (And I know this is the way)
That's the way our love should be (That our love should be)
Baby, I can give you anything
If you promise to be with me
I promise I can make you happy
That's the way our love should be
No one could love you better anyway
You'll never find another close to me
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be

Baby, I can give you anything
