(Hostile)

VERSE1-They said I am the hostile one
Caution around me cause I might explode
Don't get caught in the radiation
You might melt if you're too patient

They said I think I'm the foundation
Thanks but I don’t need complementation
They don't know me but they still hatin'
Yuh… I guess hate runs in my blood

(I am the hostile one)

VERSE2-They said I am the hostile one
Caution around me cause I might explode
Sorry that I don't play by your cult code
They said, "Get the fuck out or we'll go"

Never once offering an antidote
Leaving me for dead in the drama I'll choke
They said "uhhhh..." when I asked what you said about me
So I ebb and flow in the hostiling

(I guess hate runs in my blood)
(I am the hostile one)

CHORUS-
You wrung my heart through a fader
A Hostile hater
I’m naturally just opposed to the fakers

Taemin said you’re a “Danger”
So see you later
Should've known from that Twitler that it don’t work being a dictator

But I’m the Hostile one
The one with the gun
The hooded thug
This truth can be blunt

VERSE3-
Yuh...I don't have time for the bias
I've been down since day one yea
I don't roll blunts but they say I'm the highest

I said, "Do you have an ulterior motive?"
You thought you were cunning and didn’t think I’d notice
You said "uhhhh..." when I asked why do you think that?
I’m bout to talk a storm up with the face on my back

(I guess hate runs in my blood)
(I am the hostile one)

CHORUS-
You wrung my heart through a fader
A Hostile hater
I’m naturally just opposed to the fakers

Taemin said you’re a “Danger”
So see you later
Should've known from that Twitler that it don’t work being a dictator

But I’m the Hostile one
The one with the gun
The hooded thug
This truth can be blunt
