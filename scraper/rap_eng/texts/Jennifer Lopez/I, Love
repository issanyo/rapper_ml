[Intro]
I love
Boy, I love you so
I love

[Verse 1]
You and I have been around each other for quite a while
But I don't think that you understand the way that I feel for you
Baby, it took a while for me, yeah, yeah, to realize that you were so naive
Well maybe you were blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you (Picture for you)
I've even told your friends, but that won't do
Well, baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more

[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than you will ever know
(Love) I've been trying so hard to show you
(I) Love you like a queen would love her king
(Love) Baby, I've been trying to show you

[Verse 2]
Look at me, try to understand that I am here for you
And whatever you are going through no matter what you ask me to do I will do
See baby, I'm trying to make you see (Tryna make you see)
This is not pretend or make believe (Make believe)
I want to be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more (Want you more and more)
Never in my life was I so sure (Oh-oh-oh)
These feelings I have I can't ignore
So baby, just let me know, all I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than I can love myself
(Love) I would die before I hurt you
(I) Love you like a woman loves a man
(Love) When there's no one else to live for

[Bridge]
Baby, for so long
I've always tried to show you just how much I care for you
Boy, you had to know that I could never let you go
I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you understand that

[Chorus]
(I) Love you when there's no more love to give
(Love) Baby, I will always want you
(I) Love you when you're up against it all
(Love) I'l be by your side forever

[Outro]
(I) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(I) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(You)
