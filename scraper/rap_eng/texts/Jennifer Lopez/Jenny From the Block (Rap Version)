[Intro: Trevor Williams]
Children grow and women producing
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
L-O-X, yeah (Southside Bronx)
J.Lo, yeah (Southside Bronx)
Yeah, yo, yo (Southside Bronx)
We off the blocks this year (Off the blocks)
Went from a little to a lot this year (Yeah)
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear (They mad)
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yeah, we're at the airport out (We out)
D-Glock from the block where everybody air-forced out
With a new white Tee, you fresh, nothing phony with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
From In Living Color to movie scripts
To On the 6 to J.Lo to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm real)
That's just me
Nothing phony, don`t hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronix, from the Bronx)

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing, kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first and can't forget to stay real (Real)
To me it's like breathing, yeah (Southside Bronx)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jadakiss]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx, yeah)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block (Uh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah)
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Jadakiss, Styles P & Trevor Williams]
It take hard work to cash checks (Uh-huh)
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, they assets
You get back what you put out
If even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while you'll know who to blend with (Uh-huh)
Just keep it real with the ones came in with (Uh-huh)
Best thing to do is stay low (Yeah), LOX and J.Lo
(Everyone's got to make a living)
They act like they don't, but they know, yeah

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from (From the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronix, from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block (Bronx)
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block (Bronx)
Used to have a little, now I have a lot (Southside Bronx)
No matter where I go I know where I came from (Southside Bronx, from the Bronx)
