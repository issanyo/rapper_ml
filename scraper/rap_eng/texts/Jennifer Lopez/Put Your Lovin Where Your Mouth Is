[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby (see it, baby)
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby (keep 'em, baby)

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Like deja vu, seen it before
Ain't nothing new up under the sun
Don't take my kindness for gullible
Ain't nothing new, you can try to run
Give you your rope, don't hang yourself
Prove all my theories 'bout you wrong
Show up early, not an hour late
If you want my lovin', that last you long

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
One in a million, could you be that radiate?
'Cause that be shining right now
Can you be the [?]
Can wear you 'round my finger now?
Said you heat up my world
Can you be my global warmin' now? Oh

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby (see it, baby)
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby (keep 'em, baby)
Oh, oh, oh
Show me you 'bout that bidness
Put your lovin' where your mouth is

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
You got my front, you got my back
Without anybody else on the side
Could you pick me up when I'm feeling low?
Balance me out when I get too high
Read my the realest, no matter what
Don't just tell me what I wanna hear
Show me the words that you always say
So that picture that you paintin' clear

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
One in a million, could you be that radiate?
'Cause that be shining right now
Can you be the [?]
Can wear you 'round my finger now?
Said you heat up my world
Can you be my global warmin' now? Oh

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby (see it, baby)
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby (keep 'em, baby)
Oh, oh, oh
Show me you 'bout that bidness
Put your lovin' where your mouth is

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Don't be just 'bout that talk, need you to walk that walk
Come on, be reliable, gotta put my heart on lock
Know you want my heart on lock
I'm giving you the key, give it all you got

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby (see it, baby)
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby (keep 'em, baby)
Oh, oh, oh
Show me you 'bout that bidness
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
