[Intro]
Yeah, woo, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

[Verse 2]
Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right (Yeah)
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Bridge]
So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Break]
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, woo

[Bridge]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)
