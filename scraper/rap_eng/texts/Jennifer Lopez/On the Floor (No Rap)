[Intro]
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, ha
It's a new generation of party people
Get 'em up, yeah

[Verse 1]
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor (Hey)
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor (Hey)
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Verse 2]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor (Hey)
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Bridge]
Break it off, kick it out
Rip the roof, wreck the dancefloor
Rip these walls, light it up
Make some noise, oh

[Chorus]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
