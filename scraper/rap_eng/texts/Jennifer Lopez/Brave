[Verse 1]
It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been Heaven sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting it, I'm loving it
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid (No, no), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Yeah), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave
I am brave, I am brave
Yeah, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way, I'm scared of him
He's scared of being hurt again
It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby, don't be afraid (No), don't be afraid (No)
This is your day (Day), this is your day

[Chorus]
It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

[Bridge]
I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (No)
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I'm still okay)
I'ma be alright, 'cause I'm not afraid
No, I am brave

[Chorus]
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore (Not anymore)
I used to be cold (Used to be cold), now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid), I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way (Show me the way)
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
I am brave
