[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 1]
Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you would give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (Oh)
I never should've been with you anyway (I never should have been with you, baby)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 2]
For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway (Oh, no)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late, baby)
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (Oh, yes, I am)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway (Ooh)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Bridge]
There's no need to call me on the phone
I don't wanna hear from you no more
No need (No need), don't call (Don't call)
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door
'Cause being the woman that I am
I got to go on with other plans
Woah-oh-oh-oh, yes
Oh, yes
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (You have to go away)
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh, yes it is, baby)
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway (I never loved you)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late)
It's too late, it's too late (It's too late)

[Outro]
It's too late, it's too late
(First you say that you have to go away)
It's too late, it's too late, oh
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Ooh
(And now you say you wanna stay)
You wanna stay, but it's too late, baby
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you anyway
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)
I never loved you anyway
(First you say that you have to go away)
Oh, yeah
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Oh, baby
(And now you say you wanna stay)
Why'd you have to go away from me?
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)
