[Intro]
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)

[Verse 3]
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above (Your girl)

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (I'll always be your girl)

[Bridge]
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (Your girl)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Need to be your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one

[Outro]
I can be anything you need
