[Verse 1]
Where would I be without you, honey?
Baby I'm me, all because I love you
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls
Are nothing without your loving
Although you might hear that in every love song
It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in everyway I can think of
And this is what I mean love

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

[Verse 2]
I said you're the shhh and here's my proclamation
My way of saying thank you for your dedication
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine
And all because I know I'm your lady
And no, don't nothing get better than this, we steady stacking chips together
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other
No other can do-do what you do, 'cause baby you're the truth and that's why I gotta tell you that...

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
See, when I'm looking at you, baby, all I see is...
The greatest part of me
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
