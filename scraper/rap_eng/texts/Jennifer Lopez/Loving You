[Verse 1]
Would you mind if I took the time to get to know you?
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, ooh
I could see when I look in your eyes, you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Ooh)
I find myself still loving you (Yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Ooh, ooh)
We just need to take it slow

[Verse 2]
In the past, you would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes, I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you, boo
Baby, please understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh)
But I think we need to take the time to get back (No, no)
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I believe you and me have a chance to make this right
Oh, baby, if your heart is in it, I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh, woah, yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow
After all that we've been through (Oh-oh)
I find myself still loving you (Baby)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing (Never give up)
I never give up on the love we had (Love we had)
We just need to take it slow
