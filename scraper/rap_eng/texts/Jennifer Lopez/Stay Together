[Intro]
Say, ha
Yeah, woo! Woo!

[Verse 1]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
'Cause they be thinking they're in love when their in lust
But cliché breaking up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball, honey
People let the stormy weather push them out
But back against the road it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor (Yeah)
This time comes second nature (Oh)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated (Oh, yeah)
Stay together, that's the new trend

[Verse 2]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
And seems like everybody's giving up when
These days, breaking up's so cliché
Hear them screaming out, "Baby, no, please stay"
People always wanna always hurry up and wait for
Someone better than the person they won't stay for
They sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's the new breakup

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running (Yeah, yeah)
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving (Yeah)

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Second nature)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Hey, yeah

[Bridge]
And though there'll be the nights of fights and we must face it
It's like a roller coaster, ups and downs will come
As long as we hold tight and never act complacent
Remember how we built this, then our love is never done

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving (Keep loving)
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming (Yeah)
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Ooh)
Heartbreaks are overrated (Overrated)
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Oh)
'Cause romance is underrated (Ooh)
Stay together, that's the new trend

[Outro]
Hey, ha
Ooh, uh
Ooh
