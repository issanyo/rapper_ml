Woah, oooh...
Oooh, oh...

(Verse 1:)
Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being head-strong
Now I'm
Goin' halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No, scratch that I was dead wrong

But I know I should've let it go
But I just had to be right. (Oooh)
Could've left it alone
But no I just had to be right

Swear I, would've fell back if I knew all I'd be left with
Is these shoulda, coulda, woulda cuz you're gone

(Chorus:)
Now, I'm out here trippin'
Cuz you came up missin'
And my head keeps spinnin'
It's gettin' outta control

I'm backin down this time
I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
Cuz, I'm wrong when you're gone
When you're gone. (yea....)
Feels so wrong when you're gone
When you're gone. (yea..)
