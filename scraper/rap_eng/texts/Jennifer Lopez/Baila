[Intro]
Let's break all the rules
Come on, baby, me and you
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on, baby, me and you

[Verse 1]
You took my love to a-another level and
Boy, I'm so happy I don't have to settle for
Nobody else but you 'cause everything you do
Breaks all the rules

[Chorus]
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on, baby, me and you
Baila, come on, baby, baila
I don't care what they say
Come on, baby, me and you
Hey!
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just come along
Baila, come on, baby, baila
And dance with me, woo
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just move your feet
Baila, come on, baby, baila
And dance with me
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby me and you

[Verse 2]
Boy, you're my destiny, my final ecstasy
There is no higher place that I could ever feel
A love so strong, so real
The way I feel with you breaks all the rules

[Chorus]
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on, baby, me and you
Baila, come on, baby, baila
I don't care what they say
Come on, baby, dance with me
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Hey!
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just come along
Baila, come on, baby, baila
And dance with me
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just move your feet
Baila, come on, baby, baila (Haha)
And dance with me
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just come along
Baila, come on, baby, baila
And dance with me
Baila, come on, baby, baila
Just move your feet
Baila, come on, baby, baila
And dance with me
