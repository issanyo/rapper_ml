[Verse 1: Jennifer Nettles + Jennifer Lopez]
Well the sun goes up and the sun goes down
And it looks the same on both sides of town
(Really not that different)
Yeah I give them a kiss and I tuck them in
And get ready for tomorrow and I do it all over again
(Really not that different)
And I'm worried that I'm feeling when I'm staring at the ceiling, yeah man
Be the same way you're feeling when you lay down tonight

[Chorus: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
I love to sing, I love to dance
We're making memories, we're making plans
With the same prayers, same hurt
Same love, same worth
The places we come from may feel so distant
But we're really not that different
(Sing it like your momma taught you)
(Mi casa es tu casa)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Nettles+ Jennifer Lopez]
We hang on the bush, we hang on the stoop
My boys shooting deer, our boys shooting hoops
(Really not that different)
It's in the way we live, it's in the way we talk
I'm Jenny from the dirt road, I'm Jenny from the block
(Really not that different)
And I struggle through the day thinking there's no way
I'm gonna make it through this
And I say to myself "Baby no te preocupes"
No don't you worry

[Chorus: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
I love to sing, I love to dance
We're making memories, we're making plans
With the same prayers, same hurt
Same love, same worth
Life is what it is and what it isn't
But we're really not that different

[Bridge: Together]
They say your fences make good neighbors
Instead of building walls let's tear them to the ground
Let 'em try to separate us
Together they will never take us down
My house is your house
My house is your house
My house is your house
Mi casa es tu casa

[Outro: Together]
My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
My house is your house
Oh, really not that different
My house is your house
My house is your house
