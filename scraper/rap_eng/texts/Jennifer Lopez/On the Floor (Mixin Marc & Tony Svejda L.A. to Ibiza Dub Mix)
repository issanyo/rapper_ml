Así mismo, así me gusta, así me gusta, así me gusta

Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
Woo!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor (Hey)
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor (Yeah)
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor (Ah)
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up (Woo!)
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor (Hey)
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor (Hahaha)
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa (Ah)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Night away, night away, the night away
Night away, the night away, way, way
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Así mismo, así me gusta, así me gusta, así me gusta
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull & Both]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor (Yeah)
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor (Yeah)
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up (Woo!)
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor (Hey)
We never quit, we never rest on the floor (Yeah)
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa (Dale)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]
Dance the night away
Night away, night away, the night away
Night away, the night away, way, way
Así me gusta
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Así me gusta, así me gusta, así me gusta
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Woo!)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor (Let's rock)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club, huh!
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Up, up, up...
Put your drinks up
Up, up, up...
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Put your drinks up, put your drinks up
Up, up, up...
