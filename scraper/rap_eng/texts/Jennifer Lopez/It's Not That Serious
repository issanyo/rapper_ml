[Intro]
Na na na na na
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 1]
How could you tell me that you love me
When I knew you were just tryna play me?
But you're the fool because I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end, I know who will lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I played this game before (Game before)
And I can't play no more (Play no more)
What do you take me for? (Take me for)
It's not what you thought (What you thought)
So don't play games with me (Games with me)
'Cause I came to teach (I came to teach)
And if you want to cheat (Want to cheat)
It won't be with me (Be with me)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 2]
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled

[Pre-Chorus]
I can almost see (Almost see)
Lies coming through your teeth (Through your teeth)
In every word you speak (Word you speak)
You make it clear to me (Clear to me)
That you're playing wrong (Playing wrong)
And your game ain't strong (Game ain't strong)
I've been in this too long (This too long)
So just be moving on (Moving on)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh, ooh)
I never put that much thought into us (I never did, I never did)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was so curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Who did you think?)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (Yeah)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Bridge]
Tu me haces reir todas las veces que
Tu creias que yo no sabia que
Tu estabas haciendo
Tu sabes que yo ha sido todo eso antes
Al final tu eres el perdia
No jueges conmigo
Don't play games with my heart
(Don't play games with my, my heart)
I will let you go before you start
(I will let you go before you start)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Baby)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Yeah)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (It's never been)
I never put that much thought into us (No, no, no)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Yes, I was)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious
