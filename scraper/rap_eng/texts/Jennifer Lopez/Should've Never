[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me, how did we ever let the situation get this far?
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Verse 2]
What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul? (Into my soul)
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life (In my life)
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each other

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Bridge]
I'm so scared, trembling inside
'Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows
Oh my God, I love you both so much
And to have to choose between the two
Is hurting me so deep inside

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
I don't ever wanna feel this way again
Should've never told you that I cared about you (Never, never)
Oh, oh
Should've never kissed you
(Should've never, ever, ever looked your way)
Should've never held your hand
(Or saw your face)

[Outro]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Mi amor, a veces tengo miedo que voy a tener que vivir esta vida sin ti)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Que el mundo no nos va a dejar estar juntos)
(Que nunca mas voy a sentir tus manos sobre mi piel)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Amor mio, ¿qué voy a hacer sin ti?)
Should've never kissed you
(¿Qué voy a hacer sin ti?)
Should've never held your hand
(¿Qué voy a hacer?)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Este amor que es tan cruel y tan dulce a la misma vez)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Tocame, una vez mas)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Ay asi, asi)
(Besame, besame como si fuera la ultima vez)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Porque si puede ser)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Devorame, devorame)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Te quiero ¿Y nunca lo arrepentire)
