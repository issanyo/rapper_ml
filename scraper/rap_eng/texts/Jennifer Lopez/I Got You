[Intro: Darkchild]
Aha
Right here, it's another Darkchild collab, you know?
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to, you know?
We back
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinking
What's right in front of you can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up, now that's all you think of
Crazy how

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last (Oh)
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me, I got you

[Verse 2]
Things are often said to doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things that ain't right?
I never know but please understand that, baby, it ain't nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Ooh, no)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Proud)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)

[Bridge]
Talk is all that people can do
Nevermind all the love
All that you gotta do is simply love
Trust, and just stay or there's no "us"
Together we will get through whatever if we
Don't let speculations make situations up
We'll be alright

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Nobody, nobody)
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh-woah)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you, oh, and nobody can come and change a thing (Feels so good inside)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh, baby, they'll see)
They will see I've got you (I've got you)

[Outro]
You got me (Yes, you got me, baby)
I got you (Nothing come between us)
You got me (You got me)
I got you (Through whatever)
You got me (You're all that I need)
I got you (Oh, baby)
You got me (Forever, baby)
I got you (I got you)
You got me (You got me)
I got you, you got me
I got you, and you got me
