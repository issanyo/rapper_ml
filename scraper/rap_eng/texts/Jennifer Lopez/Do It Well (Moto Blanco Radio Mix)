[Verse 1]
Here’s the thing
I was minding my own business, doing what I do
I wasn’t tryna look for anything
All of a sudden, couldn't take my eyes off you
I didn’t even know if you could tell
That you had me in a daze, saying, "What the hell?"
Here's my name, number, baby, just hit my cell
Loving everything you do 'cause you do it well
Don't know what you got me thinking

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain’t even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good, and you so fine
Got me saying crazy things, listen

[Chorus]
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well

[Post-Chorus]
No, no
You do it, do it
You do it, do it
Oh, no, yeah, no

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you how it's gonna go
You and me gonna need a little privacy
I don't wanna do the dance, no Do-Si-Do
I need a one woman man seven days a week
Quit tryna play it cool, boy, make your move
I told you how it is, nothing to lose
You been staring over here all night for free
And I ain't takin' no cash or credit, just a guarantee
There ain't nobody else but me, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't even tryna play me, boy
'Cause you're so good, and you so fine
Got me saying crazy things, listen

[Chorus]
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
Hey, yeah, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, yeah
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night

[Bridge]
I know what you're thinking
'Cause I'm thinking it too
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night
I know what you're thinking
'Cause I'm thinking it too, babe
Do it, do it
Do it, do it all night
Baby, no need for false pretenses (I know what you're thinking)
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right ('Cause I'm thinking it too, babe)
Do it, do it, do it, do it all night
Baby, no need for false pretenses (I know what you're thinking)
I think you just shocked me to my senses
Everything that you do feels right ('Cause I'm thinking it too, babe)

[Chorus]
(Like that)
I ain't ever met a man like that (No, like that)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No, like that)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
I ain't ever met a man like that (No, oh)
I ain't ever fell so far, so fast (No, so fast)
You can turn me on, throw me off track
Boy, you do it, do it
You do it, do it, you're doing it well
