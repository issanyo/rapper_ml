[Verse 1]
I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Though I am sure of what I feel
I never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby, time will tell the tale

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Mmm

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't you promise me the sun and the sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try, ooh
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh
