Oh yeah
Yeah yeah
Ohhh
Uh uh
Uh yeah
Uh huh
Oh yeah

My girls came by
They sat me down
And they started telling me how
When you are gone
Your not at work
Said your with other women
Your such a jerk
I didn't want
To hear anymore
So I asked them to leave
And slammed the door
I didn't want to realize
My man was living a double life

I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

See I was hurt
But even more
I was ashamed to say your a whore
Cause I let you in
And I just knew
That there wasn't anyone else but you
And I used to brag
About how good
My man was but oh I never should
Cause everyone was just laughing at me
Cause they all knew what it was I couldn't see

I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

I can't
Believe
This [oh yeah-e-yeah]
Your out
There cheat-tin
Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight (tonight)

I can't
Believe
This (oh no!)
Your out
There cheatin (yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah)
Putting my name in the dirt (yeah-e-yeah)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

How could you look me in my eyes
And lie straight through your teeth?
I wonder how long it's been that
You've been fooling around on me
I wish that you would've had
The guts to just tell me
Cause I had to hear it from the whole damn world
That you were cheating on me
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Ooh
Oooh

I can't
Believe
This
Your out
There cheatin (cheating on me)
Putting my name in the dirt (dirt on me)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight (tonight)

I can't
Be-lieve
This (oh no)
Your out

Putting my name in the dirt (oh yeah)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

I can't
Be-lieve

Your out
There cheatin (cheating on me)
Putting my name in the dirt (dirt on me)
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight

Putting my name in the dirt
While your only thinking about yourself first tonight
