[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
He's all right, he's all wrong
He's a player, he's a dog
He's my friend, he's my foe
I just can't leave him, I can't go
I got my reasons, got my pride
I got these kids, we got these ties
We had this love, I had these dreams
I'm falling apart at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for this love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Verse 2]
He makes me feel like a child
He makes me happy when he smiles
He makes me sad, he makes me mad
I wanna give him all I have
And I have tried to treat him good
Show support like I should
Did my part, he's my heart
And I've been faithful from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for his love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
To save this life, we built together
We need another chance
It's like my whole life, and my existence
He holds in his hands, in his hands

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up (Oh, yeah)
I'm down on my knees (Down on my knees), I'm praying for his love (For his love, yeah)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
The time has come, for starting over
