[Intro]
Hahaha
Ooh, haha

[Chorus]
Baby, come with me (Come on)
I know I can set you free (Ooh)
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love (You'll be open)
If only for one night
I know I can make you mine (Come on)
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love

[Verse 1]
Take a moment to stop and think about
The last time you felt like this
Come on, baby, nobody's gonna see
'Cause I know you're feeling me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryna hide
When I touch you, you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

[Chorus]
Baby, come with me (Come on)
I know I can set you free (Ooh)
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love
If only for one night (If only for one night)
I know I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love

[Verse 2]
Don't waste another moment, don't hold back
I'm gonna give you what you need (I got what you need)
I'm gonna take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see it in your eyes
Ain't no use in tryna hide
When I touch you, you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

[Chorus]
Baby, come with me
I know I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love
If only for one night
I know I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love

[Bridge]
I wanna be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be, when he wants me
I'm gonna keep him feeling me
I'm gonna keep him wanting me
I wanna be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be, when he wants me
I'm gonna keep him up all night
I'm gonna keep it on his mind

[Chorus]
Baby, come with me
I know I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You'll be open off my love (Open)
If only for one night
(Wanna be where he wants me to be)
I know I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like (Oh)
You'll be open off my love

You'll be open off my love (Ooh, ooh, when I touch you)
If only for one night

Touch you in that place you like
