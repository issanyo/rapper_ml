[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Break]
Your girl, your girl, your girl, your girl
I just want to be (The one who's true to you)
I just want to be (The one who makes you smile)
I just want to be (The one who holds you down)
Your girl, your girl, your girl (Your girl)

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it (Your girl)
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above
(I wanna be your girl)
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
(The one who knows when it's under control)
The one who's true to you and down for you
(The one who knows your favorite song)
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (Your girl, the one you want when you're feeling lost)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
(The one you place no one above)
The one, the one, the one

[Outro]
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Got to be your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you (Your girl)
The one who makes you smile (Your girl, your girl)
The one who holds you down (Your girl)
The one, the one, the one
I can be anything you need
