[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
It always feels like a love to me in the beginning
My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
'Cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I cannot hide my emotions
You cannot hide your intentions from me

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Verse 2]
And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
And everything I put you through, well then, I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance (Take that chance)
For this type of romance
Its special, baby (Uh)
I always look for love to be, so exciting
But you can't force it, I'm finding
In reality, chemistry is everything

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
What your perception is
Of our connection is simply perfection
And it's the same thing
If you're accepting it, then I'm accepting it
Simple perfection, and its just the same thing
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is (The way it is, what you're saying is)
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is (It's just the way it is, what you say it is)
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
