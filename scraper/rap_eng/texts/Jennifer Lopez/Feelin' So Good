[Intro: Big Punisher & Jennifer Lopez]
Tired and relieved because he alone?
We haven't got Artist of the Year (Yup), Rhyme of the Year (Yup, yup, yup)
Grammy nominations (Yup, yup, yup, yeah), 'cause we're fat or blind or nutting, baby (Yup, yup, yup)
Aight? All night (Oh)
Playing this out my way (Yeah)
All night long, all night (Oh)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (Come on)

[Verse 1: Big Punisher, Jennifer Lopez & (Fat Joe)]
You priceless
You like diamonds, I'll ice your wrist (So good)
He got chedda, I'm twice as rich (So good)
Make you bite your lips
Jenny, dju know that dju likin' this (Oh)
I used to think you ever leave me, I'd slice my wrist
Treat you like a bitch, never that (What?)
You got beef, where my niggas at? (Yeah, yeah)
And the street's where I'm living at

[Verse 2: Fat Joe & Jennifer Lopez]
Clitter clack, that's the sound of the Mini Mack
Where we at? Uptown where it's really at
Give me that, I want the mansion and yacht (Yeah)
Advance on the spot, we can dance 'til we drop
Am I handsome or not? (Joe, you the Don, yeah)
Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Been taking care of myself)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Like I should, yeah)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good, so good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would, so good)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Said I'm feeling so good)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down, know I'm gonna shine)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around (Call up some friends of mine)

[Verse 5: Big Punisher & Fat Joe]
Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puerto Rican diva from La Isla Bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your mans off, he just tryna get your pants off
That's the last straw, Pun, I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack's raw, I give it all for my brother
Two things I don't share, that's my money and my lover
I know money's just for caring, that's for real
Take's cash to live (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You love her? Better scrap, for real
Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world, girl, set it off right

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (DJ, I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (DJ, won't you play my song?)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around (Play my song for me)
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (DJ, I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (DJ, if you'd just play my song for me)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, ooh, bring me down, ooh)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so...

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Big Punisher]
Party on tonight (Come on, let's dance)
Everything is feeling right (Come on)
DJ (Let's dance, come on, let's dance, come on, let's dance)
Party on tonight (Come on, let's dance)
Everything is feeling right (Come on)
DJ (Let's dance, come on, let's dance, come on)
World's gon' to turn me around

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (If you could just play my song for me)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down
