[Intro]
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

[Verse 1]
Baby, when I think about
The day that we first met
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel (I'm glad)
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

[Post-Chorus]
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

[Verse 2]
I dig the way that you get down
And you still know how to hold me
A perfect blend, so masculine
I think I'm in love

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
(I'm glad) I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

[Post-Chorus]
I'm glad

[Bridge]
I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living (Worth living)
I'm glad you're here just loving me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came, I've been glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time

[Post-Chorus]
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad

[Outro]
I'm glad
I'm glad
