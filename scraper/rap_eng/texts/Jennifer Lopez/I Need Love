[Intro]
Uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
This is where my story begins
Standing here with you, I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't always ready, I admit to this
But what a good feeling it is
I've had a lot of crushes, close to nothing like this (Yeah, uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Yeah, yeah)
I made up every excuse that I could think of (Oh, yeah)
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up
In a few words, this feeling, I could sum up

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Verse 2]
I was hanging out with my friends
Seven nights a week, if there's a party, I'm in
But I started getting sick of it
And when I looked back, I didn't know what it meant (What it meant)
I guess I wasn't interested in finding something real
Though I was looking for it (Looking for it)
You should've been looking for me
But you opened up my eyes, and now I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Oh)
When they say "I love you," then I only dumb up
A lot of guys wouldn't put up, girl, or shut up (Oh)
But you're the only one who told me your love was endless
A lot of words with feeling cannot sum up
First I had to figure out who I was (Oh)
To try and understand there ain't no shortcuts
Now the only thing that's missing is your love

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Bridge]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)

[Chorus]
Slow dance (Love), hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
All I need, love
'Cause I been looking for a man
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Wanna feel, I wanna feel, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love

[Outro]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Yeah, love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)
