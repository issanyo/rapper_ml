[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now looking back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be?

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Outro]
Do you know?
