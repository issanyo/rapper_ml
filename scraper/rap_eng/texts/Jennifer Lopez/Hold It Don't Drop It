[Intro]
Mafia

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 1]
Every time I try to run something keeps stopping me
(Oh, keeps stopping me)
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave
(Uh, uh, yeah, yeah)
Ah, uh, I can't control it
You put something inside of me, ooh, ooh
Uh, 'cause you're a problem
Boy, you must have poisoned me, oh-oh

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 2]
Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand
(Oh, I can't understand)
I'll be that yo-yo on a string
Goin' down, I come right back to your hands
(Uh, uh, that's right, uh)
Ah, I make excuses, but we keep on rocking anyway, ooh, ooh
Ah, but it ain't working
When I let you go, you make me stay

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing (Oh-oh)
What you're doing to me (Hey, yeah)
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need (Oh-oh)
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave (Oh-oh)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Oh, hey, yeah
Oh

[Bridge]
Don't let me (Me) leave (Leave)
Control (Control) of me (Of me)
You got what (You got what) I need (I need, yeah)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it (Oh, oh)
Won't let you go, can't let you leave
I need your love inside of me
You got control, control of me
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it (Uh)
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it (Uh, uh)
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it (Hey, hey)
'Cause you got what I need (Hey, hey)
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave (Me all open)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it (Hey, hey)
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it (Hey, yeah)
