Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
