[Intro]
Oh, yes
Yes, I did, baby
Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh woah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Oh, no)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (I wasn't, no)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
