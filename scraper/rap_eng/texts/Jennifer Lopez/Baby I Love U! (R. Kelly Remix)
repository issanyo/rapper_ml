[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby, I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you
Gotta have you (What?)
Can't be without you (J.Lo)

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Boy, I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
And boy, when you look my way (Oh, damn)
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I need you)
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night?
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright (Just one night)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, I love you (Love you)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)
Can't be without you (Be without you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, babe)
Can't be without you

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Papi, I got something to say to you (Woo)

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  (Woo, woo)
Inside me, it was strong and I loved it (I did, mama, did)
And there comes a time in our lives when things change (It's a brand new day)
And baby, I'll spend it with you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
What I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss?
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss (I love ya)
Can you love me for a lifetime but just in one night
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright  (Woo)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Oh, baby, I love you (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I need you (Gotta have you, baby)
I gotta have you (Can't be without you)
Can't be without you (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (I gotta have you)
I gotta have you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't be without you

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & R. Kelly]
Baby I love you (I love you too)
You know I need you (Woo, J.Lo)
Gotta have you (Pied piper, what? What?)
Can't be without you (Uh, J.Lo)

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say?
In the rear, drop-top Bentley on somebody's highway
Who let it jumpin' in some club on this valet?
Got a little smoke, got a little drinks sittin' in V.I.P
Got a little buzz with my hands up, honeys feeling me
Got that Cris' sittin' on ice like a gansta lean
Hands surrounding them like dice like security
After party in the Ritz Carlton, penthouse suite
All my thugs and me, breath smelling like Hennessey
Got a few friends flying in from San Diego
It's a surprise party for my homie J.Lo

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I need you (Baby, I love you)
I gotta have you, baby (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I love you (I gotta have you)
Ooh, oh, I swear I do (Can't be without you)
This a big love, babe (Baby, I love you)

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
Ooh (Baby, I need you)
Ladies (I gotta have you)
Do you know what I'm talking about? (Can't be without you)
Oh, woah, when a man gets inside your soul (Baby, I love you)
And it takes hold, and it won't let go (Baby, I need you)
(I gotta have you)
Hey, hey
(Can't be without you)
Hey, hey, hey
(Baby, I love you)
(Baby, I need you)
