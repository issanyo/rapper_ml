[Verse 1: Jack Mizrahi]
When you're vouging femme, femme, femme
Just to get those tens, tens, tens
You're the crème de la crème, crème, crème
I want you to stop, show 'em

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Clap, bitches, clap
Clap, bitches, clap
Snap, bitches, snap
Snap
I'm calling out legends, legends, legends and stars, stars
I wanna see legends, legends, legends, statements and stars, stars
Hit the floor, girls

[Verse 3: Jack Mizrahi & Jennifer Lopez]
Stars and the statements and the legends called
Jack's turning this to all-out war
'Cause here I come
Everybody wanna be a superstar, riding around in a rental car

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I wanna see runway
I wanna see old way
I wanna see new way
I wanna see you slay
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway, walk

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
(The icon Jennifer Lopez)
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful
(Face, body, sex and attitude)
Tens across the board
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

[Verse 3: Jack Mizrahi & w/ Jennifer Lopez ]
Mira, mira sen-señorita
Whether you're black or Puer-Puerto Rican
Mira, mira, ball-ball room nation
It's about fun, there's no segregation
Samba, merengue, ooh la la
I make you hot, make you hot, make you ha ha ha
Hip-hop, vogue and pop, lock and stop
Let it drop, let it drop, let it drop
Show 'em

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Where my face kids at?
Where my glam queens at?
Where my real queens at?
You want it, take it to the back
Where my sirens at?
European runway at
Labels and pumps at
You want it, take it to the back
She don't want it

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
(You can't take it, darling)
Be a lady, go crazy
On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
Be a lady, go crazy

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful
Tens across the board (Tens, tens, tens, tens, tens)
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
We serve, bitch, we don't work, bitch
We serve, bitch
'Cause here I come

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Can I see? Walk for me
Twirl for me, serve for me
Lanvin, Ebony, Icon
Infinity, Comme, Chanel, Balenciaga
Prodigy, Ninja, LaBeija, Milan
Omni, Mizrahi (Woo!), Xtravagazna, Garçon
Mugler

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez & Jack Mizrahi]
Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch
Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch
M to the I to the motherfucking Z
You can't help but look at me
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
All five elements
Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch
Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch
M to the I to the motherfucking Z
You can't help but look at me
Five, five, four, four, three, three, two, one
