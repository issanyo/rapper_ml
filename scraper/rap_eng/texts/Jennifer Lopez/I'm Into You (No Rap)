[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

[Verse 1]
You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus]
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

[Verse 2]
Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus]
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh

[Bridge]
I'm not burning and I'm feeling you, boy
We can get it on if you feeling my world now
I love the way that you move it
And I'm listening to how you're grooving
So if you need me, just call on the crew
We can be whatever that you want in the news, boy
'Cause I'm on it, and you on it
And we on it, so baby, just tell me now

[Chorus]
When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you, yeah, baby, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)
