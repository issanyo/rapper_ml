[Verse 1]
He could be the hottest man alive
But he can't hold a flame up to you and I
'Cause I'm so much better when I'm standing by your side
And I can do anything
As long as you're in my life
Since you've been around
All I ever wanna do is try to hold you down
And there's nothing, nothing that I can do
'Cause you make me feel like...

[Chorus]
I can stop a train if I want to
Can't nothing get in my way
'Cause I got you
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you, I'm stronger, stronger
I can tell the sun when to shine
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger

[Verse 2]
You're something like a drug
Impossible to stop me when I'm tripping off of love
I always run back cause I never get enough
'Cause boy, you're my everything
That's why I need you in my life
And no, it ain't a thing
I reach up in the sky, grab a cloud and make it rain
And there's nothing, nothing that I can do
'Cause you make me feel like

[Chorus]
I can stop a train if I want to
Can't nothing get in my way
'Cause I got you
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you, I'm stronger, stronger
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Because with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Because with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger

[Verse 3]
Baby, you make me better daily
Even when no one else is around
And can't nobody show me all the love that you give me
And that's why I'm gonna hold you down
So when you want me
I'll give my all
'Cause you be there to catch me whenever I start falling
When I'm with you, I get stronger everyday
That's why I say (oh oh oh)

[bridge]
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
'Cause of you, I'm stronger

[Chorus]
I can stop a train if I want to
Can't nothing get in my way
'Cause I got you
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger
I can tell the sun when to shine
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life
And baby, we can rule the world
Because with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah because with you
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Because with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger

[Outro]
Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh
I'm stronger, stronger
