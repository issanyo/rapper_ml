[Chorus]
She’s got it
Yeah baby, she’s got it
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire

[Verse 1]
Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

[Chorus]
She’s got it
Yeah baby, she’s got it
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire

[Verse 2]
Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man go mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wa!

[Chorus]
She’s got it
Yeah baby, she’s got it
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire

[Bridge]
Oh
Uh, oh!

[Chorus]
Venus
She’s got it
Yeah baby, she’s got it
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire
I’m your Venus
I’m your fire
Your desire
