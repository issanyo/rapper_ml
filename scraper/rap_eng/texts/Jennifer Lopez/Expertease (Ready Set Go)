[Intro]
Hi, hi, hi
Hi, hi
Go!

[Verse 1]
Boy, you give me hungry eyes
You and I are doing it tonight
But I don't wanna make you aware to give in
Boy, you know you make me hot
My sweet spot is hitting the jackpot
You know that our bodies are made for sinning

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know you're on fire, you're on fire
And I'm on fire, I'm on fire
And we're lit up, we're lit up
Let's rise
Yeah, you know you're on fire, you're on fire
And I'm on fire, I'm on fire
And we're lit up, we're lit up, let's rise

[Chorus]
So come on, baby, ready, set, go
I wanna go boy against girl
Come on, baby, ready, set, go
Let my body be your world
Come on, baby, ready, set, go
Let me be your expert
Come on, baby, ready, set, go (Go)
Ready, set, go (Go)

An expert tease (Go)

[Verse 2]
I'ma turn your body on
'Cause a marathon begins with passion
And I don't wanna wait another minute
We can do it standing up
Gonna feel my love, one thing unites us
You know that our bodies were made for sinning

[Pre-Chorus]
And you know you're on fire, you're on fire
And I'm on fire, I'm on fire
And we're lit up, we're lit up
Let's rise

[Chorus]
So come on, baby, ready, set, go
I wanna go boy against girl
Come on, baby, ready, set, go
