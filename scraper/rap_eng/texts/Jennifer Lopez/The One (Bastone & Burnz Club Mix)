[Intro]
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
You are every, every, everything
Oh, you are every, every, everything
I can be anything you need
You are every, every, everything
Oh, you are every, every, everything

[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you have this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you...

[Post-Chorus]
You are every, every, everything
Oh, you are every, every, everything

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be
I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you...

[Post-Chorus]
You are every, every, everything
Oh, you are every, every, everything

[Bridge]
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (Your girl)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (I just wanna be)
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (I just wanna be)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
Oh, you are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you
I'll always be your girl
You, you, you...
Your girl

[Outro]
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
I can be anything you need
