[Verse 1]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good

[Verse 2]
The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone?
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long?
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good

[Bridge]
I bet you think I need you
I'm telling you I don't, you lost your mind
I used to be so see-through
But now, I never let you on my mind
I'm worth a bunch of millions
But you be acting like your money's mine (Nice girl)
I'm on the Eiffel, chilling
I'll be damned if I let you blow my high
Baby, what you think about life
Without me by your side?
I bet you wanna get it right
But even if you get it right

[Chorus]
I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good
I'm still good
I'm still good
