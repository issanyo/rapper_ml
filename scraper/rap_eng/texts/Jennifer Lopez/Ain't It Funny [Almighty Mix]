[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
