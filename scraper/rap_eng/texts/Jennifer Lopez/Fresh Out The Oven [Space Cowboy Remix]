[Intro: Jennifer Lopez]
Break it off here, break, break it off there
Break it off here, break, break it off there
Break it off here, break, break it off there
Break it off here, break, break it off there

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Okay ladies, you got your drink in your left hand
Put your right hand on your hip
Now bounce your knees back, alternate back and fourth
And if you're doing it right, your hips will be doing the same thing, let's go

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica, dale chica
Cubano, boricua, ay que rica!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Now don't tell me that you love me to get with this
You say you stay forever, but it don't make sense
Maybe you're a balla, hope you don't miss
'Cause if not, you ain't gonna get none of this
I only wanna hear swish, I'm a big girl, I know what it is
Bentley steering whee,l is in that fist
Pick me up at 8, yeah, don't you wish

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love, fresh out the oven
Straight sugar loving
To the beat I love it, hey
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Be real, you can say who you are
Everybody say they a doctor at the bar
You got to look close to find a real superstar
You international, shit, I open up the job
I'm right so far, help yourself and take a look in the mirror
Open up your mouth and stick your tongue out far
Just a little more, okay say, ah!

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love, fresh out the oven
Straight sugar loving
To the beat I love it, hey
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
L O V E, let's not mess around, we both know what we need
Now here's what I want, understand me when I say
Make it last, okay?
You say you want the cookie, you gonna have to wait for the cookie
No touchy touchy, only looky looky

[Verse 5: Jennifer Lopez]
Mama you S E X Y, lips, eyes, hips, thighs
That's right, that's right, that's right
Kiss the game goodbye, yeah just kiss it, muah, 305, that's right, that's right
Nah I ain't Jada, I'm the past, I'm the present, I'm the now, I'm the later

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Love, fresh out the oven
Straight sugar loving
To the beat I love it, hey
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
You wanna break it off here, break, break it off there
They wanna break it off here, break, break it off there

[Outro: Pitbull]
