[Intro]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm

[Refrain]
Here I go, here I go
Feel better now, feel better now
Here I go, here I go
It's better now, feel better now

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell under
Did you expect me to reason with thunder
I still remember when time was frozen
What seemed forever was just a moment

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up, hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving

[Chorus]
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

[Refrain]
Here I go, here I go
It's better now, feel better now

[Verse 2]
I still remember when things were broken
But put together the cracks we'll close in

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry up, hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving

[Chorus]
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

[Bridge]
You and I can have it all tonight
So let's bring it back to life
Now we have another chance to fly
Another chance to make it right

[Chorus]
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back

[Refrain]
Here we go, here we go
Feel better now, feel better now
Here we go, here we go
It's better now, feel better now
