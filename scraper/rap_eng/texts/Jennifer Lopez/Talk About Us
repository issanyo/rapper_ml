[Verse 1]
I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me, we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby, please tell me

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
What are we doing, baby?
Boy, you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk about us

[Verse 2]
Could this be a crazy dream?
And if so, then you're dreaming too (You're dreaming too)
'Cause I know for sure that you feel the same as I do
(I know that you feel the same as I do)
You feel the same
Could it be that we could be wrong (We could be wrong)
Even though we're feeling so right? (Feeling so right?)
I don't care because I know that I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
What are we doing, baby?
Boy, you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk

[Bridge]
You see all my life I've waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
Where are we going, baby?
I wanna know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk about us
