[Verse 1]
Love has done a number on my mind
Though I sit and wonder, I don't ask why
Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine
Now I don't feel a thing, I feel more pain

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
Not think about it at all

[Verse 2]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Desire can deceive you, it's better to daydream
Somewhere deep down inside, I knew it wasn't the right thing
But I didn't want to be wrong, that's a chance you take

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all

[Bridge]
I'm just frozen for a moment
Oh

[Chorus]
What can I say about love? (What can I say?)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (About love)
Crowding my thoughts (Oh, woah)
What I really want is to not think about it at all (Don't think about it)
What can I say about love? (Oh, woah, yeah)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (Ooh)
Crowding my thoughts (Crowding my thoughts)
What I really want is to not think about it at all

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Frozen (Oh, woah)
Frozen
Frozen
Frozen
A moment
Frozen
