[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 1]
Can't decide, can't define what I feel inside
It's still bad, it's still good, prefer and love
It's a rush, it's so rough, this is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my boat

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 2]
Like a wild wrecking ball, crashing block-by-block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it off

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Bridge]
It's taking me down and getting me high
It brings every fantasy to life
It's getting so loud, I hear it all around
And I just can't fight

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind
