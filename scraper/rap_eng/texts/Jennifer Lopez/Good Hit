[Intro]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Go JLo
Good hit
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, get down
I got that, Go JLo
I got that good hit
Bop, bop, go
La-la-la-la, let's go
La-la-la-la, let's go
La-la-la-la, let's go
La-la-la-la, can I please have your attention?

[Verse 1]
I'm so dope, from head to toe
Armed and big, and drop it low
On the ground, I put it down
'Round and 'round, and here we go
Push up on me, I'm on the floor
Talk up on it, make me yours
Give you my love, give me love back
Baby, I'm here, where you at?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah, I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?

[Verse 2]
Bottoms up, yup, call them up, yup
Tell them that I got that gold, buy me some Louis stuff
Buy me Gucci stuff, yup, that I Love Lucy stuff, yup
Baby, I'm a classic, don't you wanna bag me?
Don't you like my outfit? Looking all flashy
Don't you want to love me up right in traffic?
All up on my bumper, tryna back, back
I'm standing here, where you at?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah, I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you wanna put your hands on me?
On me, on me, on me, oh
Baby, I can rock it like you can't believe
Believe, believe, believe, yo
I know you love you my swagger, I know you like my style
I know you like my, mmhmm, I make the boys go wild
I got you boo, relax
Baby, I'm here, where you at?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah, I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit (La-la-la-la)
Don't you wish I was your boo?

Up in the club with a lotta ass
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
