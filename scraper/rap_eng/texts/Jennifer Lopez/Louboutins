[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Oh, oh, ah-ah-ah, radio killer
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)

[Verse 1]
You said you'd change, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part-time lover (Lover)
And I'm the blame, should have went away (Away)
But yet I stayed (I stayed), with a part-time lover

[Pre-Chorus]
See, somedays you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressing out on the phone

[Chorus]
But it's the last time, I'm moving on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

[Verse 2]
I left the state (The state), changed everything
No more 818 (18) for the part-time lover (Lover)
What goes around comes back around
And then you get what you deserve, you part-time lover (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
See, somedays you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressing out on the phone

[Chorus]
But it's the last time, I'm moving on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

[Verse 3]
Watch these red bottoms and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby, don't know what you got until it's gone
Tail lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

[Chorus]
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

[Bridge]
Watch me walk it out, walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out, boy, watch me walk it out
Uh, walk it out, walk this right up out the house

[Chorus]
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (Out the house)
