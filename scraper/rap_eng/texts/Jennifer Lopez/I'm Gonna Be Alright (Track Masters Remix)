[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & (50 Cent)]
Oh yes
(Uh-huh, yes)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I want to be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears (Woo!)
The reason there's two karats in each your ears
I sperge with the paper, ma, I don't care
How you like the pumps, boots, Jeeps, coupes?
Make celebs, 50 fall off never
What's mines is yours and what's yours is mine
So when I shinin', you shine
Come on, the finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get you confused sayin' 50 bad news
I need you in my life, girl, you're too much to lose (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & 50 Cent]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you, yeah)
But now it's time for me to make that move (Uh-huh, yeah)
Oh woah

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Now when I tell you what my wishes are, you don't respect it
When I smile at you, you don't smile back to reconnect it
You ain't even gone long but I already miss you (Yeah!)
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
All the talking on the phone, all the time we shared
How could you fix your mouth to say I don't care?
I had plans for us to buy ice together
Engagement rings and things and share life together (Woo!)
Now when your friends tell you 50 called you like whatever
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start?
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart?
Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez]
Oh, no
Be alright, yes
Oh, no
Says I'm gonna be alright

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
