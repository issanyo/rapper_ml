[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
My head's killing me, I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning and it's starting already
Why my name always involved?
I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love, no

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap!)
Get off of me, (Brap!), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah (Ow!)
'Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
I'm just the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
'Cause I'm on the same ride, know I'll never change
I'm lovin' every day, I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way 'round

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap!)
Get off of me, (Brap!), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah (Ow!)
'Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
I'm just the same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)
Same girl (Same girl)

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
I'ma keep on going, keep on shining
Just wanna do me
I have to thank God 'cause he chose me
I'm still the same girl

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Chris Brown]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me (Off of me)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (Brap!)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders? (Brap! World on my)
Get off of me, (Brap! Off of me), get off of me (Brap!)
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (I don't owe nobody)
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah
(Ow!)
