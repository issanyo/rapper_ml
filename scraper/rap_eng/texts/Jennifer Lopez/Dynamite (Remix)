[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on
Yeah!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"
Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I came to move, move, move, move
Get out the way me and my crew, crew, crew, crew
I’m in the club so I’m gonna do, do, do, do
Just what the fuck, came here to do, do, do, do

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on
Yeah!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Jennifer Lopez]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"
Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!

[Bridge: Taio Cruz & Jennifer Lopez]
I'm gonna take it all out
I'm gonna be the last one standing
I'm over it all and
I'm gonna be the last one landing
'Cause I, I, I believe it
And I, I, I, I just want it all
I just want it all
I'm gonna put my hands in the air!
Hands, hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air!

[Chorus: Taio Cruz & Jennifer Lopez]
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"
Cause we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
Cause I told you once
Now I told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like it's dynamite!
