[Intro]
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)

[Verse 1]
Don't want your number
Don't need your name
We ain't getting younger, baby, let's play
Don't even wonder it's just a game
We're rocking body to body, let's go insane
You push me harder, I'll do the same
Boy, I want to feel you in every way
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We rocking body-to-body, let's go insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Hook]
Make love, don't fight, let's hook tonight
Let's hook tonight

[Verse 2]
Turn up this mother and let it play
I know you like my bumper, don't be ashamed
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We're rocking body-to-body, let's go insane

[Pre-Chorus]
I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Hook]
Make love, don't fight, let's hook tonight
Let's hook tonight

(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands, to the beat)

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping till we done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
