[Intro]
Jennifer
Okay, okay
Wait
Roll again

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say, I'm feeling you

[Verse 1]
He's a legend in the making
This voice is the blame to fame
His rhythm is similar to basketball
The way he shakes and he fakes and he takes some more
With everything he does, makes me feel his love
When the DJ plays this song and we all sing along
Up in the club with our hands in the air and it's all because
He's a poet, if the world doesn't say it, I hope that he knows it
This is for Chris, big up to Nas, this is for Biggie, of course
Shout out to Brooklyn, and here's to the Bronx where it all begin

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say, I'm feeling you

[Verse 2]
When I was growing up in the Boogietown
Hoping that music would be my faith
Looking for a way to escape
Recording the radio, took a set tape
They all saw to the UMC's
Snoop Dogg, Andre and now it's 50
All day, every day
'Cause MC's, they make me feel a special way
Down south and your families
Back up to Bone Thugs N' Harmony
And I can't forget the ladies
Oh no, the ladies, knowing you crazy
'Lil Kim, Queen Latifah, you the queen
Salt N Pepa, Mary J. and eve
You'll need to understand
Sugarhill made me wanna be who I am

[Chorus]
Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say, I'm feeling you

[Verse 3]
LL Cool J, P&D
Rock and Too Short, Eazy-E

Make it on the mic and let me see what you got

[Bridge]
Get on the mic and let me see what you got
Get on the mic and let me see what you got
Get on the mic and let me see what you got
Get on the mic and let me see you rock, Jay-Z
