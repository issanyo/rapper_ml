[Intro]
We can make it, we can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it

[Verse 1]
I can't wait, wanna see how this night is gonna be
Just a touch away from the feeling that is here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y
Aye-aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist

[Pre-Chorus]
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y

[Bridge]
Let's take a chance, and try love, baby
No, I'm not giving up
'Til you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time
Aye-aye-aye
We can make it last, we can make it last, we can make it
Aye-aye-aye
We can make it last, we can make it last, we can make it
Aye-aye-aye

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Walking on sunshine, middle of the night, yeah)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (Sky)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Walking on sunshine, middle of the night)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (The sky, so high. so high)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (Somewhere, the sky)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Walking on sunshine, middle of the night)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (The sky, so high. so high)

[Outro]
We can make it, we can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it last
We can make it
We can make it last, we can make it
Aye-aye-aye
