Yea let's get this money though my nigga
Ahh man fucking on us man fucking on us
Man I'm not going back to prison nigga
I already got two strikes nigga turn the music down nigga
Fo' real nigga I ain't going back fuck that
(Just take a ticket my nigga you ain't do nuthin)
The fuck is you doing Man fuck it I'm telling you nigga
Don't tripIt's gonna be all good man

[C-Bo]
Can't turn my back cuz they'll attack (what)
I know sky is the limit
But this world is full of envy hold me back
I've been done it
Shit what you thought? C-Bo wasn't down?
It's just hella hard to get up when they hold you to the ground
I spit the real and they can't take it so they gave me a case
I got skills but I can't make it, be an Enemy of the State
I close my eyes and pray to GOD
I guess this was meant for me
Just like 'Pac "Against the World" but it's the world against me
Scared to see me in my jew-els flossin a whip
Tossing your bitch, you slip we hit now tossing ya clips
Bossing and shit, pigs think I'm bubbling cavi
Cause if the cold world air maxs
All the dubs on my navi
Holla at me shit, Feds wanna see me in action
Heard they mad cuz what they make in a year, I pay in taxes
I'mma ball like the Jackson's and I won't stop till my casket
Or I'll murda them bastards

They thought it was over but it just started
And some of the hardest artists in the world
Gonna bow down til we death departed
Freedom of speach got me preaching to every G on the street
We gotta eat so fuck the P.D. three striking me
Not liking me want to strike me like Rodney King
But I'm a home run hitter so I swing batter batter swing
Got to scheme to get away, and I'ma scream yes yes y'all
As I put the beam to his fuckin face
Now my new case is a murda
As I birth this flame without the HK
Hit the gas and get further
I'm a killa like Manson
Like the nigga from South Central that hit the white boy in the head wit a brick and started dancin
Fuck parole and Pete Wilson I'm so fresh out the pen ho holdin heat
Like Billy the Kid quick to split a nigga's wig
I'm the type of nigga pop you out till you lend me a cape
Til I die, worldwide an Enemy Of The State

Seemed to be drifting down the same road as Shakur was
With authorities C-Bo's albums sales heat up after rapper's parole arrest
Thomas was acquitted for 4 years in Soledad prison of the illegal use of firearm
He could be sent back to prison for a year if the board of prisons

[C-Bo]
I'll bring it to them how they want it
There's only one way to do it
Bring it to them how they knew it
On they death bed put by fluid
Put a slug in his cranium
Catch'em close range and I'm flaming them
I'm the West Coast don loc fresh out of prison and smoke
Any nigga that set trip gotta be stir crazy wit a death wish
Better check my backround
I crack crowns I never back down
You want some ruff shit tuff shit you get dust quick
See me in traffic grab your automatic and bust bitch
You violated my freedom
Only playback is eat'em
Like Dahmer but I bomb'em with teflon when I'm on em
Fuck parole fuck prison fuck those that don't want to listen
I'm sick and I can taste your ??? for Thanksgiving
I've done killed and dumped bodies in ditches
And still kept a smile on my face
Hittin' switches with bad bitches
I'm a menace muthafucka you ain't heard?
Fuck it, Enemy of the State's my last word
