I'm on a mission for money, dreams n' Bentleys n' Ferrarris
Influenced by the biggest ballas now bitches wanna call us
Picture me with all the cheese mansion lookin overseas
Pushin limosuines n' stackin hunits n' g'z
Dubbz on my sports car six car garage
Its like a mirage when you step off my back yard
Rollies whinnin diamonds shinnin I'm gettin mine
Them models you see on TV fuckin em' all the time
Zippin on $200 bottles of champainge
Till I'm dead in the game won't a damn thang change
I'm a boss bitch thats why I floss bitch
And we leave from the club you gettin tossed bitch
Besta believe I'm a thug keep it crackin n' stackin my mill
Taller than (??) (??) n' roll like a back down
Fuck goin' back to jail
Bitch I'm back to the hotel in my V12 wit mo' kill

[Hook]
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut two rollies
Mac like goldies somebody better hold me
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6
Twenty inch rims with the all chrome kit
Ballin like king tut nigga what
Two rollies somebody better hold me

You see me sliddin up not givin a fuck we done been up
Throwin up the mob down the block so bring it up
I be flossin in my Mercedes wit yo lady
Got her tossin zippin on Baileys we do it daily
It ain't NOOOO bitch livin up on this earth that can play me
It ain't NOOOO snitch livin up on this earth that can hate me
I be sideways shakin dick up on the highway
Havin it my way I think it was a Friday better yet a Thursday
Thinkin about the first day my CLK went to hit the bay
It was a true figga young mob figga make mans skrilla
Gettin close up on the trigga
Yall dont wanna see me in my 4.6 seee
TVs in the back seat
Now police wanna catch me
Cuz I'm livin large $80,000 cars
A young ghetto star no matter who you are

Chorus

I put dubbz on my Benz got my 64 lifted
Swimmin in money because I'm gifted
Livin the life of a rap star Bentleys n' double R's
Ride luxury cars flossin wit allstars
Catch me overseas counting g'z and they hate it
Mad cuz a thug nigga done made it
Wanna see me down and out bank account on rip
You players haters you can suck a fat dick
I put the gat to yo lip breath smellin like shit no breathin
To the wizard of oz hard courage is what you needin
Beat up n' get up out it before I draw down
Wit a 44 caliber desert eagle got shit locked down
Like a dog pound and we all down
For that dubb C L mafia loc
Ain't no stoppin us loc
Not unless you poppin us loc
I'm a floss across town like the president
Flip a yay and dont touch no evidence
Baller Style!

Chorus

[Killa Tay]
I'm a cap pilla you fuckin wit some real killas
Ride through my 9 milla on cock like a dike bitch
I'm bellin it tight bitch
My profile ain't rightous I'm a thug lord
I got whatever you need like a drug store
Hard core killin off all enimies
Them dollies crackin speed knum you on my g'z
I be ballin like Rasheed Wallace but fuck college
All a nigga need is my heat and some of this street knowledge
Get some dollas straight thuged out
Put up in yo chest n' still holla all in my mouth tryin to get popped out
But I burn rubber on hood rats we ridin high speed
Cuz I like to drop E off Remy and weed
I'm through the town like the HIV
Regulatin strikin dirty wit a fake ID
Instead of hatin I be chassin this paper hard status
Its in my nature still copin kids never potin licks wit no fakies

Chorus
