Verse 1-(C-Bo)

My first name is Smith, my last name is Wesson
But in yo hood I'm known as 357
Have yo neighborhood punk quick to shoot a man
And have Clark Kent thinkin' that he's superman
Wit six in the cylinders chambers
I'm the cup of courage that got ya feelin' like the ultimate banger
But some fools misuse my abilities
Doin' drive-by shootin' everythingthey see
I'm quick to cap it in yo life if you tempt me
Playin' Russian Roulette but is the cylinder empty
Fully loaded fool, you shouldn't have been trippin
Then you wouldn't be holdin' yo head in yo hands to keep yo brains from drippin
I'm a lethal weapon registered in everythang
Used by the police, dope dealers an yo local gang
I'm the hardest muthafucka alive, right in front of yo eyes
Kill any man wit the quickness now who the fuck am I?

(Chorus)

I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, quick to peel a cap
I'm yo friend to the end, you know I got yo back
I'm known to every trigga finga so everytime you squeeze
I'm kick out so much heat I'm bringin he-man to his knees
I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, fool you know me I'm the reason why yo punk ass got locked up for that murder beef
Cuz after all I'm only a gun, an a gun ain't got no love
Remember that when you fill me up wit them hollow point slugs

Verse 2-(C-BO)

Mr. Tre-five-seven, I send that ass to heaven
Quick to murder muthafuckaz, an quick to pull 211's
I turn a big bad nigga into a cowardly lion
An if he's thinkin about jackin, boy I'll keep his ass from tryin
See I don't give a fuck, pull the trigga an I'll buck
When you rollin wit tre-five, fool, whoever steps is suicide
I never been a snitch, but if you do some crazy shit
You best to have a handkerchief to wipe the finger prints off yo grip
Cuz if you down I'm down, fool, it ain't no half-steppin
I'm a leathal weapon, just point me in his direction
An ain't no tellin who I'll hit so you niggas better run
I'm Mr. Tre-five-seven, that's any kind of killaz gun

(chorus)

Verse 3-(C-BO)

No one can hang, I'm the downest on this earth
No regrets, no sorrows, no remorse when I burst
I hang on the side of your task force an the waist of yo neighborhood killaz
Might catch me up under the seat, or ridin in the lap of yo dope dealaz
I'm known to robbin banks, jewelry stores, an 7-11's
Some use me for protection, an some use me for 1-8-7's
It's best to call the police if you think you see me comin'
But whatever you don't run cuz you might tempt me to start gunnin
I kill at will, quick to spill guts when I bust
An when a habit drops, you muthafuckaz can't touch
Mo deadlier than a pitbull, when you locked up in my sight
So stay up outta my path, an beware because I bite

(chorus)
