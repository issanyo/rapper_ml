[Intro: C-Bo]
Yee
For the '94 bailing through the door with steel toes on
Creased to the max, you know what I'm sayin fool?
Beanie cap on, loccs in the top pocket
It's like that though...

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Diamonds in the back
Sun rooftop
Diggin in the scene with my khakis creased, bitch
Niggas want more?
One-eight-seven and you know it's hard-muthafuckin'-core

[Verse 1: C-Bo]
I hit the block on some fourteen-seven
Strapped with a mini-HK mac-11
Niggas start shaking as the white gold approached em
Off the block, ass drop, three-wheel motion
Bumpin that autopsy
A hardcore spliff like a dolphine
I'm ready to get sick so back up off me cause I crunch like King Kong
Or blaze that much thicker than a dinosaurs backbone
With my steel toes on
I can't be faded and they can't be ready to still stand strong
With dedicated but they can't play cuz I'm too hard-core
One-eighty-seven proof pure huff and puff
With the flow like a lion's roar
That's just the Loco
So get the front row
Steppin' up to execution shackled down to my boots
And with some new hit
That one-eight-seven music that fools hipped
And juiced up to buss---
I keep my hip on the slunder
We ready to rumble
Took em like Lennix, watch em stumble
Then make the gat, fumble
I'm coming to get mine so separate mines from yours
And I don't give a fuck fool, cause it's hardcore

[Intermission: Tuna Bug]
The definition of hardcore
Is to bust on the next man when he disrespects
And not to tell on no-one, always take the fifth

[Verse 2: C-Bo]
Fucking with that south-side lunatic got ya
Gettin' with that PG down for that GB
So when it's on, bring it on with all you got
OG's specializing in making that Glock pop
So think before you step, think before you speak
I'll have you buried up to your neck with sand
Overlooking the beach, just assed out
And when that tide rolls in
You'll be shorter than a midget in quick-sand
With led boots, so shoot when you see the hoo-ride
Scoop down your strip unloading the clip to bring that hip
Killas live long so step with some shit
I was 'bout to groove four-deep with four extra clips
And tearin' niggas chest up
As soon as he hit the canvas pocket check-up
Jackin' them niggas and breakin' they ass off sum' tough
Like Celly Cel, said "Retaliation is a must" so duck when I bust
'Cause if you don't, you'll be standing for the whole clip
I'm known to pop, cock and lock infrared on a nigga's lip
So if you step, step with the vest
We with that .50 and it still buck holes through a nigga's chest

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Diamonds in the back
Sun rooftop
Diggin in the scene with my khakis creased, bitch
Niggas want more?
One-eight-seven and you know it's hard-muthafuckin'-core

[Verse 3: C-Bo]
Come up off that 'caine, niggas catching pain
Stick my gauge under their chin, blow their fuckin' brains
Bo-Locc the psycho, going head-hunting
Coming with them fully loaded automatics, dumpin' em
Clips empty tips, smokin' niggas, we ain't no joke
So check yourself 'fore you wreck yourself
Cause the hoo-ride's down to smoke
The streets is getting hectic in this shit, call me priest
Keeping niggas up on game, the street knowledge king
Shit that I done seen would make a grown nigga throw up
From puttin a bomb in a sucka's mouth, watching his head blow up
I'm putting in work stepping on brains in my steel toes
Any sucka cross my path, and I'ma pick their throat
So think before you move, quick 'cause I'm in this-
Shit 'till death do us part
Quick, come get with this
I'll have you groovin' in a drop
Keep G's in your pock
Mobile phone, and a Glock
Coming up, that's on the block
Come fuck with a real nigga and stack mail
Niggas that's down to kill
Nigga and when we strike
?? does his thing
??? Diddy-dog killing for that green
Nothing but that hardcore...

[Chorus: C-Bo]
Diamonds in the back
Sun rooftop
Diggin in the scene with my khakis creased, bitch
Niggas want more?
One-eight-seven and you know it's hard-muthafuckin'-core
