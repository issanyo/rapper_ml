𝐴𝑙𝑙 𝐼 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑤𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑏𝑒 𝑎 𝑡ℎ𝑢𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ℎ𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑙𝑖𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝐼 𝑘𝑛𝑒𝑤
Forever thuggin! Forever thuggin!

Forvever thuggin I keep my mind focus and risin above skies
Thug til i die slang drugs til I rise
Will I ever fly or will I die from a drive by
Witness my victims writhe til they die
Dear LORD will you ever forgive a nigga's sin
Cause I stay surrounded with trigger men
And it's on until they kill again
I'm in the finest clothes, fucking the finest clothes, pushing the finest loads
I'm a thug by nature they got these motherfucking fists hitting a nigga on his pager
They got me trapped in Seattle sleepness, tryna blame me for my homie's death
I'll make you muthafuckas reap this
And any niggas want to ride on me
Step forth and you could die on me
Bullets fly like the fourth of July torches in the sky
Watching [?] die, forever thuggin!

[Chorus]

You niggas wanna see me fall off, get caught up and get hauled off
Become a victim of a sawed off
Life's been full of trifes in ways but soon I see better days
Passing my pistol away with better ways
Stay away from all this madness, and all these suckers lookin at me evil wishing that they had this
Given through traffic something new
Protected by bullet proof close my eyes hoping that is true
Thankin the LORD for all the stress he put me through
Teaching me right from wrong don't want to spend life from home
Hoping that I wasn't wrong for slinging ki's, bringing home g's
Cause in the water it's so hard to breath
Bless the LORD for my baby girl, gotta get her ready for this crazy world
Ain't nuthin worser than a lazy girl gotta get your mind right
First and learn to love school and believe in everything you do Forever thuggin!

[Chorus]

It's g's up hoes down though they slang kilos and pounds
Stay flossin the whole town navigators with the tv's in em
Can't believe it when you see me in em with the six changer dvd in em
Straight up out the gardens, lowlife ass nigga
Since day one always been a trife ass nigga
And ain't none changed but the change
4.6 range blew our brains, phat house on the hills
Now they callin me C-boss because I be playing with about six mills
Since my deal with warlock fuck some pork chops
Taking Lobsters tossing wine glasses with the mobsters
Off-shore bank accounts, swiss have a nigga piss
Dam can you imagine this thug nigga wit mo money than
That uhh nigga and that mexican border brotha wit a plug nigga
I'm flooded nigga, Dom P, Cristal
Budded nigga, beenie cap, pistal
Thuggin nigga, killafornia, cap it out
Without direction, muthafuckas best to map it out
Straight gangsta baby don't get it twisted
Dubs on my sports car, everything owed is lifted
And this fast stack I'm holdin ain't foldin all
Big face swollen, bitch I'm west rollin

[Chorus]
