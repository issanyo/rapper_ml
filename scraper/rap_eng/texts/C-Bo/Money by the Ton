If you've got a ton of big face hundred dollar bills
How much money would you have?
And every hundred dollar bill weigh a gram
And there's 28 grams in an ounce and there's 16 ounces in a pound
How many pounds is it in a ton?
Got to be about your uhh, uhh, uhh.....

Verse One: C-Bo

I slide thru, the 5-double 0 drop S-C
'97 Sport and shorts and matchin jew-els
Worth about a quarter, mil-ticket is how we dress
True ballers fakin meal tickets up in the West
I know you wanna touch us cos at the clubs you ladies rush us
Cos we're all about our cash, luxury livin and hoes love it
Havin money by the ton, Rolex and Bossalini
A nuchi give Versace cologne, now wanna see me
At my best or worst? I gets paper when I burst
Repeatedly, heated, dumpin low-low's, you know I'll burst
To get my cash on, I spin the A-1 dolla
For money by the ton, come get it with no soda

Chorus: Mississippi

Money by the ton, that's the way it comes
We all, get paid
Ooohhhh ooohhhh, we make
Money by the ton, that's the way it comes
We all, get paid
Oooohhhhh

Verse Two: C-Bo

I'm all about the paper, nothin can come between that
But Lexus, fully diamondback, ???? and bald caps
Holler "Thug", that's what we be, who you see?
Steepin out of ragboys, cornises and Bentleys
Six million dollar homes, we stays to the flow
Now how much cash can you stack in a twenty thousand pound boat?
It's money by the tons, fo' sho' homey and all hunds
And if ya get past the gate, cameras and pitbulls, you can have some
Flossin, no one flosses like bosses do
But caution, when they float cos the wrong step, bodyguards swoop
To protect those, diamond Rolexos
Sippin that XO on chromed-up leaky's and Lexo's
I put it down, pound for pound, surrounded by the millions
Fancy cars, movie stars tryin to make a billion
Come show them my cash bundle, you are a pocket
Addicted to money, they can't stop it, it's daily comin by the ton

Chorus

Verse Three: C-Bo

Now how you picture mad loot, stretch Rolls and rag Coupes?
Big faces laced, I want all my dollars brand new
I stand true to the game, on loot to the money train
Rolex's and diamond rings, big bodies with the blowed brains
I bring the pain to get the cash like Jesse James
Til the wild wild West is drained by Major Pain
Who got the loot? Big bodied Coupes and S-Classes
And when we swoop, kickin the loot or catchin casket
Load up the rigs, with crazy big-faced hunds
Headed for the drug, still weighin it by the ton
Cos money makes the world go round, stackin off-shore accounts
Waitin on the ?????
So be a baller, got to keep it on the slunder
Milli'ns by the hundred, transactions thru account numbers
More money than you ever seen in big faced hunds
Comin in a hundred and twenty million every ton

Chorus (x2)
