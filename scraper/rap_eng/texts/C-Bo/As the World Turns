[C-Bo]
I hits em up with a two finger
Out the roof of a regal
And combat fool
I'm known for packin' a Desert Eagle
Niggas know the rules
Under pressure from Pete Wilson
And all these new laws
For filling my draws
And never pause a straight hog
Fuck some dogs we want it all
Real nigga third
That dump slugs and share hood
You know what's up cuz
I put the dick in the mud
Know the California mob bosses
Stay surrounding with thugs
Get at me
Cuz my shit be a 100% real killas
Stranded in the ghetto paying
For protecting tha drug dealers
The love niggas
Down and dirty that plug niggas
And slug niggas in the face
With one of they pistols
And mug niggas
It s all about the power
So I count my money every hour
Hope my choppers devourer the whole hood line
They cower
Like the duck hower
We leave em plucked fucked and burning
Feening fo mo money as the world keeps turning
Nigga

[Hook]
Round and round as the world keeps turning
My enemies burning
My enemies jurn these burning
When it stops nobody knows
I m busting slugs and fo s
I m busting slugs and fo s
Round and round as the world keeps turning
My enemies burning
My enemies jurn these burning
When it stops nobody knows
I m about to catch the do
Catch the do

[AP-9]
My henn full of smoke
I broke the flow to a nigga toe
Plus I'm fresh out of dope
I need some mo
Cuz that s all I know
I be balling till I die
They wanna see me fried
For being a good guy
Through my eyes I'm
Heck living barely breathing
Smoking weed with my OG's
Ride till I d-i-e
Young G blessed in the dope game
Big boss and brains
Capping a nigga up in the game
My niggas with caine living
Life in the fast lane
Get a job nigga
Shoot and rob nigga for scrilla
Nation wide thug nigga
Me mug niggas and drug nigga
And slug niggas for the court phoney
And blow they ass up like pretty toney
They keep the rollies
My ap nine stay cocked
My mind military barely scary
You make a move your getting buried
In the cemetery
Thugged out beat it
Undefeated better believe it
When it s on as the world goes round
We blasting niggas with the chromes

[Hook]
Round and round as the world keeps turning
My enemies burning
My enemies jurn these burning
When it stops nobody knows
I m busting slugs and fo s
I m busting slugs and fo s
Round and round as the world keeps turning
My enemies burning
My enemies jurn these burning
When it stops nobody knows
I m about to cash the do
Catch the do

[Spice 1]
As the world turns
We all get paid
Some niggas be shot up in graves
We stacking these meal tickets and
Leaving my enemies froze up and sprayed
Mobb cars and training these bitches trying to kill
We on some thug shit
Niggas be bobbing the steel killing at will
We on site and mobbing the fuck out
Leaving niggas taking their last breath
Money and death
Dam my foes in comas stuck in the darkness
Mutha mix with half keys
Shot em staking in the alley
And niggas can t see these natural born killas
Up in Cali
It s hardcore drama
Niggas be down up in the streets
Streaking heart beats for weeks
And enemies won t get no sleep
Mob techs and gauge
Slugs we be dumping to the graves
Rearrange muthafucka pay
Bossaline with about three thangs
And a half a key to spend a dayton
Shooting po po up in the basement
And tryna to pull a nigga over
If muthafucka can t shake him
And a nigga won t rest in peace
Till my enemies burning
Bossaline be bringing the drama
As the world keeps turning

[Hook]
