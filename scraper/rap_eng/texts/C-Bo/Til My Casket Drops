Mo' murder, mo' murder

A body fulla tack 2's, battlescars from bullet wounds
New clothes, diamond medallions from paid dues
Niggas that ride til they rue with the attitude of
'fuck the world' from tryin to kill us everytime we move
You're perpetratin to be a killer but I know you're fakers
Them jealous cowards killed my nigga 2PAC in Vegas
Vague kind of bullets fired, we're ready to die with open eyes
I be the last man standin when the smoke dies
This world's infested with haters, wannabe players
Player hatin a real player cos he's livin major
No disrespect to you redneck blood-suckin pigs
If a nigga die, just give my cash to my wife and kids
But what you thought makes the world go round
I got an ese in the East Bay ballin a hundred pounds
Push a 600 rag drop E-12
Dump a 100-round clip in ya, ask about my mail

Chorus:

I try to keep my focus, on survivin and money
Can't let them niggas smoke us, before we unload them talons
Traumatise and hope this is how we leave em when they hit us
With the guts to die, pullin the trigger til my casket drops
*repeat*

Them player haters wanna blast me up like they did 'Pac
But I don't give a fuck I'm a ride til my casket drop
It don't stop until you sucker niggas drippin jelly
Pumpin slugs into you motherfuckin pig's belly
I'm full of indica weed laced with heroin
Call it Kryptonite-on the dead, I'mma risk tonight
Blast the first motherfucker that steps
Up to my ride, not knowin where my weapon is kept
I shoot in-side their chests, I'mma thug life, I'm crazy
Got my strength rays to make him kiss his babies
Fuckin sucker ass niggas that didn't ??? ???
Hard lies on him and didn't retaliate
Hard then later on "Shit, hey what's happenin?"
We woulda chased them suckers down and capped em
Give a shout to Outlaw Immortalz right
Look me up cos I'm a ride until my casket drops

Chorus

Murder, money, power, pistols and warfare
Kill all my black folks and the peckerwoods wouldn't care
Keep my head up, duckin and dodgin from the state pen
Cos fo' sho', ain't no future in goin back again
They got to kill me, fill me up with lead
Let me, die slowly from my boots to my head
As a, big chief I refuse to retreat, I
Rip teeth outta eye then dump heat, why
The PD reach but catch concrete
Never sol-ved, gone off indica and Hennessey
Infrared at my dog, paws locked like pig jaws
With my gun up, punk, I run up on alla y'all
Then I dump, dump dump dump to get the money
Now I stole Rolex diamond, shinin outta sunny
West Coast the spot, servin caine to get the millions
Distributin the game, makes you want to get the billions

Chorus
