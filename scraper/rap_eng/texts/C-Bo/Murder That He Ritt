[Verse 1:C-Bo]
I don't know judo
But down with you, you know
Strapped with two Glocks
Gone off some Kuno
Headed for the house party on the southside
Four deep in a ragtop six five
Hella bitches (hella bitches)
Hanging out the window
Killer Cali style [?] eight fifty-fizzle
Hoes don't stack
Cause niggas been balling crack since the mac (since the mac)
Packing they gat and won't think twice to bust a cap (buck)
Sportin' a brim like Freddy Krueger
Some drinking heavy shooters (shooters)
All strapped down with two Rugers (with two rugers)
I pull over hit the juice on my ride
I got front and back and side to side
In murder that he writ

[Hook]
(The murder show)
The murder that he writ
(The murder show)
In the murder that he writ

[Verse 2:C-Bo]
I'm a born soldier to these hell made streets
In my dreams when my back is turned somebodies murderin' me (Uh)
I'm waking up in cold sweat
Every little noise I'm hopping out the bed reaching for my tec (tec)
And I'm on the streets I'm very high on paranoia
Looking for the neighborhood destroyas
I'd rather murder than be dead confused
Celebrating my birthday in the news (uh)
I drop tears for my dead homies
And spent years trying to get my money
And pack a tec for you phonies
And get mines on my only
Turning motherfuckers into rest in peace homies

[Hook]

[Verse 3:C-Bo]
(Murder)
See, I'm a G from the block and when there's funk it's on (it's on)
I'll be the nigga with a strap to your homies dome
Headbuttin'
Crushing them bones
With that HK, Buck 'em (Buck Buck Buck Buck)
Sittin' that ass down
Retaliatin' be some out of state negroes (negroes)
Decapitate and leaving afros in steel toes (steel toes)
Some more hardcore killers (killers)
Balling dope dealers(dope dealers)
Klu Klux [?]
The real deal'ah
Bailing your hood like thrillah
You're either killa, or vacator get killed by the killa
Now what do you prefer?
It's best that you disperse
Or be the next verse

[Hook]


[Verse 4:C-Bo]
Now here comes the big gangster
Hopping out the regal
Pants sagging,Fat pockets eagle (fat pockets)
Fifty Cali style
Stacking up G's by the pound
Sipping amaretto (amarretto)
Packing a throwaway beretta
And been in it to win it since the beginning
So when I pose took the slugs with my .44 leaving niggas froze
It's fuck you ho's in the mind of a psycho
Kicking off rides when the lights go
I did my time on the cell block for selling rocks
I'd rather let the cops shell shock then get popped
So next time I'll protect mine with my tec-9
Having wreck time
They can't check mine

[Hook]
