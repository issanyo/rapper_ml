[Verse 1]
We getting money got the getting money
My nigga from Rap a Lot get the money
Nigga from tha row get the money
Stick wid it niggas is get the money
Westcoast mafia
I gave the gangbanging like fuck the money now I see
My riches to get my milk and honey as I touch the stage
Prescious my life of caine women scream my name while
Sipping on champane we came perpacked in this rap game
And I'm a rider to deth living the life of fame to my last breath
I see that when the money came that's when the women changed
Fascinated by lexus and gold chains luxury cars conversating with
Movie stars now they feening justing to know who we are
We rap stars getting the paper like tony draper
Living major like 40 water far from pulling capers killa
Califonia sunshine ya ass all mine as I drop the top on cloud nine
From a 500 to a 600 mercedes ladys praying that they catch me
On I 80 yea we get the money

[Hook]
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops I know you hate me cuz I'm getting my rice and gravey
In my mercedes on I 80 with your lady we get the money
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops california be the state full of diamonds and well boss playas
Pushing big body as L V-12 we get the money

[Verse 2]
Killa cali where the gangbangers kill thugs stacking money
Make a mill come short on my scrill till I magnum off in your grill
In luxury cars sitting on 20 inch wheels influnced by
Big ballers up on a hill addicted to having money stacked up
In large bills I gotta shake the hills and blend in with the real
Cuz I'm seeing too much of this penitentury steel
Holler if you hear me my dogs touch me if you feel me
Got these pinky slugs my neighborhood tryina kill me
As I seem to escape death caught up in this rap game
Give a shot out to my locs caught up in the crack game
Stacking for caine but ghetto started the fame only mission to game
From life of poverty pain I will remain the same
And money can never change these true thugs dedicated
To the game to get the money

[Hook]
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops I know you hate me cuz I'm getting my rice and gravey
In my mercedes on I 80 with your lady we get the money
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops california be the state full of diamonds and well boss playas
Pushing big body as L V-12 we get the money

[Verse 3]
I'm on blunted fast cars in the pit like movie stars
Hear the women scream their heads off when they find out who we are
Platinum lexus full of baggets and crushed carrots keep'em jocking
When I'm on stage with 30,000 rocking my lyics spiced out
Ear and neck wrist iced out versachi cloths keep me glowing at night
When the lights out yeah I come dressed to impress
But only the best shit drank cristal and moet
My crew pack smith and wess with bulletproof vest
And if it's broke when I finished pissing then they handle the rest
Like a don heavy head when the bed get rest body parts
Scattered to ocean shores to the wild wild west fool
This is westcoast mafia better think before you jump
I meet my nigga teado at the roof in the rain with the mausburg pump
Kill'em up my nigg fill'em up make sure they dead
I give a fuck no luck put slugs in both of they heads
We get the money

[Hook]
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops I know you hate me cuz I'm getting my rice and gravey
In my mercedes on I 80 with your lady we get the money
Rest in peace to the homeboy pac representing westcoast till my casket
Drops california be the state full of diamonds and well boss playas
Pushing big body as L V-12 we get the money
