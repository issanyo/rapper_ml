[Verse 1]
Now can you picture this, black 40 caliber wrapped in my fist
Hopping out a Challenger sending challengers in a bliss
Now focus on the killer that thrill off of my adventure
All I leave is a flash of gunpowder that you remember
They mix the thugging in public beneath the evil eye
Where they fight fire witg fire to defeat the evil guy
So hard to focus when life is so hopeless for the youth
So predatory for territory we just go and shoot
And getting drunk and smoking weed is the only action
And fucking bitches and squeezing triggers for satisfaction
So critical that when we do is just to justify
So experimental to the world they objectify
Can't be a man in poverty, fully sanitary
Only freedom I see for us is when a man is buried
So fuck the cops and they laws till I'm compensated
Fuck the 40 acres and a mule that was understated

[Chorus]
Orca, the killer whale of the hood
I know they'd rather see me fail if I could
Provocative lyrics, 2Pacalypse spirit, coppers'll fear it
Make a killer squeeze with a chopper when they hear it
Orca

[Verse 2]
Trapped in the city, no pity when the semis let loose
The killer ocean this bulletproof is my wetsuit
No one can save me, the babies is crazy
So my next move have em running wild when the tech shoot
Criminal mind the only intentions of homicide
So we graduated from drive-by's to walk-by's
Guess it is the penitentiary eventually
And I will not cry when they mention me and they sentence me
I know my life is suicidal
It can be me in the streets with em checking my vitals
But I will not worry until I'm buried, my killers'll come through
And hit you and put blood on ya bitch like Carrie
Kansas was my tutor Black Guerrilla's my father figure
The mob father the straight killer the mob figure
We rottweilers that pop collars with all triggers
The conscious of a thug nigga natural born killer

[Chorus]
Orca, the killer whale of the hood
I know they'd rather see me fail if I could
Provocative lyrics, 2Pacalypse spirit, coppers'll fear it
Make a killer squeeze with a chopper when they hear it
Orca

[Verse 3]
They told me death was coming and I ain't ran yet
They say they coming for my head and they ain't came yet
Them bullets riddle from out the thick with my entourage
And for me it's kill murder murder like I'm a God
I'm infected with this thug life can not save me
Been injected wit this shit since a motherfucking baby
Born in the projects, shoot at any target
And everyone of you niggas is the object
Physically I'm the misery of your reality
And mentally I'm the headache about my salary
It's M.O.B, still money over bitches
In the Chevy hitting switches damn fool about my riches
Society trying me, trying to give me the book
While the feds tapping my phone, trying to give me the hook
Big fish on the line, crime is a way of life
And if I gotta serve time I'll pay the price

[Chorus]
Orca, the killer whale of the hood
I know they'd rather see me fail if I could
Provocative lyrics, 2Pacalypse spirit, coppers'll fear it
Make a killer squeeze with a chopper when they hear it
Orca
