[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I'm thugged out enough to beat your fucking ass right now

Cuz I'm the jacka the calidod pack the yay sacker
Tell your bitch to shut the fuck up for I slap her

Look like dacula plus the young mob nigga that's smother shit
For the scrill my real niggas noting know who it feels

[Verse 2: Fed X]
Put your guns up gather your troops up
Your shoot wasn't bust out but your aim wasn't good enough
You claim killa you did what I did
But I'm a natural born killa you and me at the same nigga
You get your gun tooken to war about to jump off
You fell to the floor you should close your eyes
Didn't jump off get your mack snatched use your own gat
You know what I want run this shit or get your skull capped blown back

[Hook: C-Bo]
Bitch open your eyes and realize that you cry on ya
Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you on your way
To your grave bitch we born killaz

Cover your head and duck when bullets flying on ya
When that ak spits you can't save shit you to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 3: Hustla]

Nothing but street star hustla hustla nigga what

Your favorite rapper catch a slug in his booty
On the ground, screaming like a bitch

[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Mini fourteen holler from out the window
Can't handle the static get stuffed in the casket murder
Them bastards grab my ak off the shelf
Find the destination and send them niggas to hell
My occupation is a must that I stack G'z

Believe that I'm loco with the pulled off fo fo in your front door
Will have you butt-naked taped on the floor

[Hook: C-Bo]

When that ak spits you can't save shit your to your
Muthafucking grave bitch

[Verse 5: Ridah]
I was too young to understand why they shot at me
But how can I remain a solder at ease and let the release
THE FAG they try to get me to participate
Not at this rate and see my though strong try to recoupe me
Before I'm there and gone like the Apostles

[Verse 6: ap9]
Stuck in this world without no help
Niggas don't know we play for self and for keeps
Late night streets when niggas dump heat no retreat
Cuz the feats on my tracks
Without my five eating off this platinum plaque
For the fact that niggas ain't shit so they blaze
Turn the page off the rage in a maze
When they can't squabble fuck stuck in a face off
Soaking up more coke as I erase you job
Better duck when the bullets fly

[Hook]
