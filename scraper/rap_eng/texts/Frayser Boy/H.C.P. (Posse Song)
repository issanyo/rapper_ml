[Frayser Boy]
For the dro, comin' through the doe
Got it 'bout to click bitch
Used to fuck with you tough, now you on my shitlist
Frayser Boy, keep it on the low
Reap it then you sow
Yeah that 40 nickel close
Nigga keep it for a ho
Games played, lames sprayed
Fuckin' with the six, ho
Find out where you live
Cause it's time to pull a kickdoe
Snatch your pussy ass out your sleep
I'm a nightmare
Threw your ass in with the stand
Leave it right there

[Lil Wyte]
I really think you lost your wind
I'm like goddamn, this'll make you snatch up out your care
This Lil Wyte the motherfucking cracker from the camp, yeah
I hold it down where I am from
Or hit the corner, blow them crumbs
A psychopathic lyrical lunatic
And my gauge has to thump
Fuck you motherfuckers, I'm not going, I'm too smart for that
Me and Cruncy Black creeping somewhere dressed in all black and strapped
You wanna test the 6, Frayser Boy or even Project Pat
Whether or not I say your name you know where this missile's landing at
Say something else

[Lord Infamous]
Whoever wish to diss Three 6, I'll massacre your ass
If you live, creep up to your wheelchair, rip out your shitbag
Bitches bark like pitbulls but bite like poodles
Talk that shit in person, Red Dragon cook your noodles
15 years, Lord's a microphone fiend
Like Michael Myers bitch, my anniversary is Halloween
And I'm deeply into voodoo
Cut out your tongue and mute you
Wear three vests and it's STILL goin' through you

[Juicy J]
To be just like me I must start confessin'
18 years of work and prayin' and God's blessing
Raised, a ghetto child, North Memphis and that's a fact
I walked them car lots, pay cash for Maybach
It's easy to see bullshit I ain't wiiit'
Haters talkin' shit 'bout HCP cliiick
And nobody produced producers that God made
Hard on them beats and yes we is paiiid

[DJ Paul]
It's HCP nigga what the fuck you think
We pop hydro shocks and you be shootin' blanks
I got four full clips, you on a quarter of a tank
We bust like nuts on a porno tape
I'mma hit you from the rooter to the tooter
With this automatic shooter
Whatever part I hit, best believe it's goin' through ya
Shootouts for whole days
24 hours long
We been in battles for real
Y'all just making songs 'bout it

[Boogiemane]
I'm the Boogiemane bitch
Ain't no ho in my blood
It's plenty much love givin'
So I'm bringin' them slugs
And dumpin', frankly I've been sick of all these bullshit games
I'm the type, the first nigga out bringin' the pain
And gon' make sure that his ho ass losin' his life
4,5,6 shots, motherfucker surprise!
Gonna be the only motherfuckers left in this bitch
For when we mob out nigga you'll be locked down, bitch!

[Crunchy Black]
I am the main one, cut 'em up in chunks
You would rather mess wit' a faggot than mess wit' me punk
See it's one the hard way, in case you heard
I'mma send you a word 'bout a lil' bitty bird
Let me let you know somethin' see it's time's out for talkin'
Go on a blind date and meet the yawkin'
It's hard hittin' niggas don't wanna see you stalkin'
Your body on the ground outlined wit' chalkin'

[Chrome]
Violate Lil' Chrome aka Corleone
Niggas gon' need stitches just to make it back home
And I say what I mean and I mean what I say
Some Looney Tune rappers, you ain't the hardest where I stay
I never bite my tongue, you will get knocked out
Frayser, Wyte and Chrome, we the truth in the South
Hit your mouth, we really really bring 'em out
HCP bitch, put the barrel in your mouth

[Frayser Boy]
Gone like what happened?
Must have been the drugs
And them haters nuts pumped
Nigga hater put a slug in her mama
Keep it gutter in the field where I come from
Had a few minor scratches and scrapes but I'm unharmed
Y'all actin' like a ho wit' a big old wet pussy
HCP, ain't a nigga I'mma let push me
Sayin' what I feel cause I'm real
Cause it is what it is
Homie we could handle this
Cause it's real where I live
HCP nigga!
