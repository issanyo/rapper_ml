(After Break the Law mix)

(Frayser Boy)
Ima gun wavin' miss behavin' what you wanna do my nigga
Pulley nigga, trilly a nigga, when I'm pullin on the trigga'
Get the clip, stick the clip
Cock about one in the chamber
Aim that Bitch, Stain that Bitch
Now your lifes in fuckin danger
Brangin it and slangin it just like the crews I'm hangin it
I gotta fuckin Glock up in my draws and maintainin it
Frayser beezy off the heezy, holla if you fuckin needs me
Blow a niggas ass off, have him on his hands and kneezy

(DJ Paul)
Don't get it wrong, it's Blackhaven's own
We too black we too strong
A nigga get warm a nigga get gone
We got some big tones, its bout to get ugly
Dont fuck around with Triple less your body gets bubbly
We gettin hated on by niggas wit two dollars to two million
Forty million man to 100 zillion
I guess its cause we got them cars, for real they lyin about it
Im cuttin . . .  for real he just rap about it
