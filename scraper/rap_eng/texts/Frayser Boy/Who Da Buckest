[Intro: Juicy J]
The Gangsta Disciples and the Vice Lords have teamed up
We gonna fuck the motherfuckin' clubs up
The fuckin Liquids, the norths and the D & D the spot
GD's, VL's

[Hook: Project Pat]
Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
Man you hoes don't wanna clown

Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear
Man you hoes don't wanna clown

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
First nigga wanna step
Gonna meet his death
First I hit the nigga with a right, then I swing a left
Kept on dropping B's after B's till I'm out of breath
Then I took a knife and cut the fool till he bloody wet
Boy you gon' respect
Real players when it comes to that
Knowin' this ain't slavery but nigga we gon' hang your neck
How you gonna diss the check writer, hoe I am a threat
Shoot at your bitch ass like the killa know you scared of that, scared of that
Bring it on nigga to this motherfuckin' M-Town
Click click boom then you feel your body fall down
Don't be trippin' with these Hyde Park Gangsta's
Robbers, killers, dope boys, rapists
Gangsta Fred, Heavy C, workin with that maintenance
Cut you up, wrap you up, leave ya ass stankin'
Pimp slap ya ass, momma boy, feel the rugar
So fucking sweet, I should probably call you sugar

[Hook: Project Pat]
Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear

Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
If you do we beat ya down

[Verse 2: LaChat]
Now when I fall up in the club, I be yelling "smack a bitch"
Steady mobbing with a mug, yeah this thug starting shit
Nigga what bitch, what, get the fuck up out my way
Throwing bows, pushing hoes, letting you know I'm in the place
It's whatever, get it done
Hope you cowards, got a gun
I'ma ride until I die, making bitches out here run
You can run if you wanna, where you run is where you die
I'ma break me off a prada stick, your ass in the eye
It's Chat, you got beef
All this animosity
Look here mane, I'm a aim, shoot that thang for playing me
You a killer bitch nigga
Never have you pulled a trigger
You got hoe off in your blood
When it rain, hoe you shiver
Have you ever seen a bitch come through the door and take the floor
Gangsta walking, representing cause a mack ain't going hoe
Breaking laws, fuck the law
Keep them bitches out my business
I'ma shut this joint down, everybody gonna witness bitch

[Hook: Project Pat]
Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear
Man you hoes don't wanna clown
Man you hoes don't wanna clown

If you do we beat ya down

Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
My nigga, my hood, so you cowards better fear
Man you hoes don't wanna clown

[Verse 3: Frayser Boy]
What ya cowards wanna do, don't give a fuck about what ya saying
Pull a pistol on ya in a minute with no delaying
Frayser Boy, I'm comin through
Nigga who the fuck is you?
Got yo nuts all pumped up, I'll whip yo ass til ya blue
Throwin that Bay up in the air
Nigga I don't fuckin care
Niggas practice looking hard, but ain't gon' do shit but stare
Mean mugging in the club
And bout to get yo ass drug and
I don't hide behind my words, I'll beat yo ass down in public
I'm the realest of the real, better ask yo fucking peeps
Knock a patch up out ya head and stomp yo ass till ya sleep
Man this liqour got me geeked
You won't see another week
I was in here tryna chill, now ya got me bringing heat
Take your ass up off ya feet
Leave yo body with a leak
Ring the bell, school's in, here's the lesson I'm gon' teach
Better stay away from reach
Ass whoopin you gon' see
Have yo ass like decepticons hollerin' retreat

[Hook: Project Pat]
Who the buckest up in here, who the buckest up in here
