You a fuck nigga, niggas dont fuck with you nigga
You Donnie Brasco need the Calico nigga

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I'm an apex predator, tiger shark Lord
Nigga fuck goin' ham, I'mma go wild boar
And I snatch yo teeth out with some red-hot pliers
And I sew yo gums up with some rusty barbwire BLAY!
Woe to da foe of tha bloody Scarecrow
Futuristic Bounty Hunter, mystical mojo
You niggas are timid, I got a nine milli
You look in the mirror, you scared of yo image
When Scarecrow is comin' to pay you a visit - God is my witness
You are now rockin' with the best
They gonna close your casket, I remove your head and chest
Pussy nigga you can put on two or three vests
I got a rocket launcher fuckin' off your whole set
And with that said:

[Hook/DJ Paul Sample]
You a fuck nigga, niggas dont fuck with you nigga
You Donnie Brasco need the Calico nigga

[Verse 2: Partee]
It's the King, bitch respect me when I'm comin' through
Real street nigga test me I show what these guns will do
I moved out the hood but I still run the BHZ
Plus I had no choice cuz the feds was all over me
Make you drop it off drop it off, pussy boy
Ran off with my money now your life is what I'm hungry for
Look at you now you stupid fuck
How smart could you be with yo brains blowed all over the truck
Real to the gristle, no snitches, don't even ask me
When it come to paper chase my nigga I run the track
We smack the shit out ya, make you less than a man
Made a song dissin' all the time, you a fuckin' fan nigga
You just a Fuck Nigga

You a fuck nigga, niggas dont fuck with you nigga
