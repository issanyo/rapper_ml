[Juicy J]
Frayser man tell these niggas how it was in the Bay

[Verse One]
Comin up I was told to take what a nigga need
Niggas say lets rob a nigga blind, and dammit i'd agree
Learned from the best Green Bry way back in the day
In the Bay saw a nigga get jacked for his jacket
It all started when my cousin put a gun up in my hand
Already had some sticky fingers, time to rob a man
Doin dirt since a young cat, you name it probably done that
You let me in your house a day later a nigga come back
Get the mask, get the Glock, haulin' ass to your block
Stuntin a little to much my nigga got me mobbin to your spot
Wrong place at the wrong time, incidently cost
Got on Jordans size 12,  nigga I'm like take em' off
Kick a door off the hinge, house call, comin' in
Got a cocksucka' dope and his dividends
Ain't no friends in this fucking game that we call life
Wear your Cartier to the Club better think twice

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm

[Verse Two]
I see my victims, I gotta get him, I gotta stick him
How could I miss a chili which what made me pick him
Roley on his wrist, shoes on his whip, got me scoopin'
Gotta catch his ass all alone is what I'm hoping
Got that fuckin Glock, got it fuckin cocked, thats fo sho
In about a minute he gon' find me kickin in his door
Trail his ass home, in my hand the chrome, about to stain
If he give me static, automatic take him out the game
Pull up at his home and he all alone, Jackpot
Saw him grab his pistol out his muthafuckin stash spot
Crept up behind to commit the Crime, drop the gat
Fore' I blow your ass off, put one threw your Gucci hat
Picked up the tone, now its fuckin on, robbed him blind
Didn't know that night, he'd be the victim of a fuckin crime
Took all his cash, stashed on his ass, Nah nah
Now that a nigga can fit, my description, he can't stay alive

[Chorus]
So I'm fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
Fresh up out the pen once again
With mask and Glock
Give me dividends or my friend
Yo ass get popped
I gotta touch'em
I gotta touch'em
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to (Get'm)
I gotta touch'm
I gotta touch'm
I say I had to Get'm Get'm Get'm Get'm
