[Chorus: x2]
Look im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho
Your friend throwin' me the pussy, im goin fuck that ho
Im for real, im just goin tell you so that you know that im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho

If you ain't notice by now you know a nigga ain't' shit
Don't give a fuck bout yo feelins because I think with my dick
I had this female you know we fuck off for bout 2 years
I kept doing some dog shit, kept that bitch shedin tears
I didn't mean her no harm, that shit was just in my nature
Fuckin all over these ho's,all these bitches will hate ya
She had this one friend she kick it wit, this ho was so thick
My nigga told me how he fucked her and she sucked on his dick
So you know I investigated, had to pull that ho card
I knew if I made it obvious this bitch would be bar'd
From comin over are house, my broad would cut up so quick
So I had to come wit some game dog, I had to be slick
This ho gave me a certain look when she came in my presence
So I gave her a certain look back let her know I was ready
For whatever this shit may lead
It might lead to her on her knees
Servin her boy with a cap, making sure a nigga pleased

[Chorus: x2]
Look im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho
Your friend throwin' me the pussy, im goin fuck that ho
Im for real, im just goin tell you so that you know that im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho

One friday my gal went out a town for the weekend
She knew the buisness, while she gone a nigga creepin
Her friends knockin on the door knowin that she gone
Im like "if Tasha knock on this bitch, she wear this bone"
Now Tashas the broad I mentioned in the first verse
She's always looking freaky deaky in a short skirt
She must of hear my thoughts cause shes knockin at the door
I let her in, before you know it skirt drop to the floor
She started kissin on my neck down to my chest
Shes going down, theres no need for me to stress the rest
Before you know it, I lay her gently down in the bed
That pussy fat while as im watchin her pull back her legs
I bang for a minute, heard keys up in the door
My gal saw what we was doing, mouth dropped to the floor
She went chargin toward the bitch tryin to choke her out
If she listenin to this song she knew what I was bout

[Chorus: x2]
Look im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho
Your friend throwin' me the pussy, im goin fuck that ho
Im for real, im just goin tell you so that you know that im a dog azz nigga so dont trust me ho
