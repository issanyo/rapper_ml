[Fryaser Boy - Intro]
Cut the lights out

[Frayser Boy]
Ima tell 'em how I really feel, ain't gon sugar coat nothin

You can't stop a real one
Catch 'em slippin go bananas niggas got to peel em
For sure its gettin hectic, its HCP respect it
I sleep with one eye closed pistol stay ready
You didn't expect this Frayser Boy and Young Chrome
He lack the family Paul and Juicy made him come home

[Chrome]
I'm chillin out at the Marriott, sippin on lean
Servin this nigga next door pass the morphine
Then my phone ring, its my nigga Frayser-Beezy
Sayin he know this nigga who got birds and he easy
Talkin like he the man, since he open up shop
Knowin he ain't real, ima give 'em what I got
I'm from the bricks, the project, pop 'em on the spot
Catch 'em walkin up out the door with a small package

[Chorus]
Niggas been so serious, I can't play no games no more

[Chrome]
Nigga I been held with a small clientele
Niggas dont wanna see me I can see it I can tell
In or out the booth nigga im the damn truth
So I advise you week niggas (echo)
Slow your role lil dude or youll get yourself hurt
Fuckin with real niggas we leave blood on your shirt
Its your boy Chrome, born and raised in Tennekey
Ya we takin hits, go on run up and get split, bitch!

[Frayser Boy]
Nigga ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Have a nigga ass missin if he fuck with us

Wrong one to fuck with, bullets make you duck quick
Bring it to the floor hoe, wanna try your luck bitch?

[Chorus]
