[Hook]
Nigga I been smokin dat Ooh wee
Have you been smokin dat Ooh wee
Cuz I been smokin dat Ooh wee
Police said I was smokin
I said who me

[Verse 1]
Man its late one night
And I need to smoke
Tell my nigga fore he come
Hit the corner sto
Grab a pack of cigarillos
A couple of beers
Blunts a day keep the doctor
Away thats the cure
Gotta smoke just to get though my day and night
If my days a lil gloomy it'll make my day bright
Smokin til its daylight til it turn back to night
The next day ready to do it again thats right
Shot gun stop son
Let me pull on my own
All that bullshit with da smoke
The blunt be gone
The aroma in my clothes setting in like cologne
Can't stand around my mama when a nigga at home
Hate a nigga that leech
When you smokin they reach
Tryin to linger round and shit
With that bullshit speech
Ain't talkin bout shit
Thinkin you go pass da blunt
If you waitn on me to pass
You'll be standin there a month

[hook]

[Verse 2]
Smoke a variety types of weed
Choclate tye, purple haze. red hare
Guareenteed to leave a nigga in a daze
Regular if its some fire
Then I go let it blaze
In California smoke some shit that had a nigga high
For days
Eyes tight
Ready to eat
Lets get some soul food
Probably still smoking when I be a old dude
I thought a nigga told you that I love to smoke weed
I hope God don't hold it against me when I'm praying on my knees
If I got all the money back
For all the weed that I brought
I'd have money out the ass
Busting like a vault
In 2000 I was caught smokin weed in the car
When I got to jail I was smokin
Weed behind the bars
Ain't shit go stop this
Got a life time supply
Keep weed every where I go
Thats why I stay high
Lets do the damn thing
Get the lighter
Fire it up
Hit the liquor sto
So I can put some hen
In my cup

[hook]

Cheefin fat blunts of dat danky danky 3x
Big diamond rings on are panky panky
