(Frayser Boy)
Bay Area Represntitives
Smoke somethin wit me, Drank somethin wit me, Pop somethin with me
Whatever you got man fuck wit me

[Verse One]
Now its time to tell the truth, while a nigga in the booth
Tryin to lay this rap down, so I can get it out to you
Been sippin on some syrup, maybe why my speesh spurred
Damn, I mean my speech slurred, hardly gettin out my words
Ridin a car, in to lanes, about to crash on the curb
Smokin Blueberry Weed man fuck what cha heard
Popped a couple pills now its time to pick up a girl
Arrived at her house, she came out lookin kinda perdy'
Banged all night to next day, bout until two
Sex was great, came to find out she popped some pills too
Get something to eat up the street, then I hit my nigga Crunchy
I know its on, we have smoke outs, every fuckin Sunday
Hit the club, later on that night, Im drunk off Hypnotic
Nigga barely holdin on a party goin on in my body
Fire a blunt up in the club, niggas reachin like a savage
Need to go and see some help to control my drug habit

[Chorus x2]
Ill bring the weed
You bring the liquor
Grab them pills
Lets pop up my nigga

[Verse Two]
Where them weed smokers at
Where the weed at
Where them weed smokers at
Where the where the weed at
Chillin on the weekend, I'm at the red light
Roll up a couple blunts up, I need to get my mind right
My dog had a bag of blow, but I ain't wit that shit lil Bro
Its just an idea, I can't have nothing goin up my nose
Swing by the liquor store, get a half pint of gin
Take a couple swigs, then a nigga pass it to a friend
Stay high everyday do this on a daily basis
Tell me stop doing drugs, I give yo ass a crazy face
Had a job, but I got fired, I'm like whats next
Supervisor got results back, from my drug test
I was high when I wrote this song, I know that dont surprise
For fun I smoke a lot of weed and kick it with the guys
Keep greens in my eyes, got a blunt up to my lip
So far its got me spreaded, minds goin on a trip
So thats it, got a gut, so for real I ain't chokin'
Take a swallow out my beer I'm on the next thang smokin

[Chorus x2]
