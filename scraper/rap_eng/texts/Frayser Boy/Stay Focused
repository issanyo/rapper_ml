[Chorus 2X]
So What you sayin
All I do is sit back
Watch my front
Watch my back
These streets real
I know that
I stay focused
Gotta stay focused

[Frayser Boy]
Dont let nobody get you out your game man
They got it and I dont all want the same thing
I strive to be the motherfucken best
Seperate me from the motherfucken rest
Im tryin to change the game all the way around
Yea im the young nigga y'all hate now
Cause ain't no other way im tryin to get paid
I can't fall so I gotta keep my shit straight
Im real focused, hoping that you notice
My options open, im easily provoken
Think about the future cause the past kinda gone man
Have to be a leader cause I got to do my own thing
It ain't hard to see a nigga im a grown man
I won't stop until my bank account say long change
I try to stay away from those that'll make you click
I just focus on the things that'll make me rich

[Chorus 2X]
So What you sayin
All I do is sit back
Watch my front
Watch my back
These streets real
I know that
I stay focused
Gotta stay focused

[Frayser Boy]
Im out here gettin it homie however I can
Responsibilities, yes it could better a man
I grind hard for this shit that I got today
I got better things to do ain't no time to play
All I have to say, it could get too late
Cause when my money lookin right, hip hip hooray
I got a lot of people nigga that depend on me
Man sometimes I feel like I can't win homie
It ain't no givin up, Paul said he had a vision
That make them beats sound like them raps, I made my decision
They brought me to the camp welcomed me with open arms
And I ride on any nigga if the wanna harm
Cause its the only thing I got and im gon protect it
Im branded HCP nigga best respect it
Im goin straight ahead what im lookin back for?
I gotta reach my goals and success is what im after

[Chorus 2X]
So What you sayin
All I do is sit back
Watch my front
Watch my back
These streets real
I know that
I stay focused
Gotta stay focused
