Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go
It's not money, art's what I do it for[x3]
Money come and money go
Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go[x2]
It's not money, art's what I do it for [x3]
Money come and money go

Business and art--inversely proportionate
I just wanna make art[x2]
Money is the death of art
I'm just making art[x2]
Pussy's all that men really want
They're all just focused on my digits
I'm out to create art, not business
Flying business class, rockin' Prada kicks
You couldn't pay me to fuck an ugly bitch
Beautiful but dirty, the truth nobody knows
A rat's beauty isn't captured in a photo
Art is long but life's short
Money'll give you an image but who you are can't be bought

Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go
Money come and money go
It's not money, art's what I do it for[x2]
Money come and money go
Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go
It's not money, art's what I do it for[x3]

Money comes and money...
You can buy art with your ends
And roll around in a Benz
But you can't buy good sense
Nobody can buy good sense[x2]
If you want business, take it to Dentsu
I'd rather make art than money...

Skinny body, tattoos all over
Even now they never gets old
Picasso and Joan Miro
Having nothing is also
Pretty dope
Fuck a title, like Min Tanaka
I'm not a rapper
I'm not a fuckin' rapper
I'm just me[x2]

Livin' life as myself
Livin' for money, I'd rather choose death[x2]
Livin' life as myself
Livin' for money, I'd rather choose death

Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go
It's not money, art's what I do it for[x3]
Money come and money go
Everybody's all about the dough
Everyone needs money though
Money come and money go[x2]
It's not money, art's what I do it for[x3]
Money come and money go
