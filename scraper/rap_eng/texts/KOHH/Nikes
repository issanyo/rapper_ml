[Intro]

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain’t likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
It must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin’ buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they’re up to something
That’s good for us

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
We'll let you guys prophesy
We’ll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don’t know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

[Verse 3: KOHH]
一人の男
たくさんかわいい女の子
誰かのことを 誰も縛れはしない
他人の心
まあ、飲みたいならお酒でも飲もう（ふぉ）
彼女がいたり、彼氏がいたり
気の合っちゃう人間２人
しょうがない
男たちと 女たち
去るもの追わず
来るもの選ぶ
それだけの話
今しかない時間
大事にしな
何億万人も
いい人ならいるよ
あの子がまたモデルの子に嫉妬
でも好きなら好き
無理なら無理だし
次から次に （次に）
類が友を呼んでくれるいつも （類が友を呼ぶ）
たまには離れてみるのも必要 （必要…必要…）
自由にする まるでパリスヒルトン (パリスヒルトン)
