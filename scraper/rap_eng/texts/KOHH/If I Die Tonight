[Verse 1: Dutch Montana]
Wake up after 12, same old routine
Light one up, check the news then leave the scene
As always today was supposed to go smoothly
But right now trapped in a car trunk, probably
Robbed of freedom, tied up in this tape
When the car stops, it's probably a sign of fate
Mind racing up until then
Thinking about friends, loved ones and the enemy's intention
In this world, what's real and what's a lie?
It takes more than hard work to stay alive, only the real survive
Nothing to do with what color skin you got
Trunk's popped and get shot...
Yesterday that's the movie I watched

[Hook: KOHH]
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
You never know when you're gonna die, but
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
Tonight, tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?

[Verse 2: KOHH]
It's better to be alive
Now more than tomorrow
Sportin' distressed jeans
Inhale, exhale and swallow
Sleep when I want, there's more good shit to follow
I wanna live dressed in dope shit, just copped an ACNE T-shirt
Art is long but life is short
Full of peaks and valleys, never any end in sight
Goin' round and round, get it right
If I die tonight, there's a point but it makes no sense
Everyday marks another death
Incense near the grave but we're alive and couldn't care less
It's impossible to live forever but
Until we're all dead, live it up!
Live it up!

[Hook: KOHH]
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
You never know when you're gonna die, but
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
Tonight, tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?

[Verse 3: Salu]
If I died tonight
Would play some tracks of mine?
Had fun conversations but now it's too late
For sayin' I never went through with it
Don't really wanna start reviewing it
Cause all I did was fuck around  and never got to do it
I wanna chill forever, I wanna chill forever
I wanna chill with you forever
Or I wanna die unaware
Modeling for APE was my last job
So, thank you God
Final sound; The Ocarina of Time
Baby if I die tonight
Baby if I die tonight, I'm not scared of that
Rather, I just wanna leave some cash
For them and for her, I just wanna leave some cash
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
There's all these things I still wanna do
But just one last time, I'd like to see you

[Hook: KOHH]
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
You never know when you're gonna die, but
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
Tonight, tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
If I die tonight, if I die tonight
What'd you do if you were gonna die tonight?
