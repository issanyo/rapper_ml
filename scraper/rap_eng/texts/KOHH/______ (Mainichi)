All day

[Hook]
Livin’ life’s the shit, all day
I do what I wanna do, all day
Damn, I play a lot, all day
Damn, I make a lot, all day
Blue head of hair, all day
My whole body’s covered in tattoos, all day

[Verse 1]
If I don’t like it, I hate it all, hate it all day
Every every every time, all day
Shit’s changed, different in a good way for a long time
Without complaining about it, I just did what I wanted
I don’t wear Fendi, Versace anymore
Now ACNE, Mason Marjiela and RAF SIMONS
I go thrift shops like RAGTAG and CHICAGO
No matter how much I make money, I just love the stuff
I used to have nothing, so I need more
Money money money lala money, go spend it at Aoyama
Omotesando’s all right but kinda played out
So the prices are high, so what?
I don’t give a fuck, all day
I really don’t give a fuck
It’s all about now, not a second later
I’m lovin’ every day right now
Until the day I die, I’ma brag about livin’
I’m lovin’ every day right now
Fuck tomorrow
Forget fortune telling and the future
If I had spare time to think about bullshit
I’d rather have sleep with a girl I like, y’all should too

All day

[Verse 2]
Breathe in and exhale
Eating great meals
Dates with cute girls
Just having a good time
Life’s so sick, all day
I just do what I wanna do, all day
I buy what I want, all day
Fuck saving money, I spend it all day
No point thinking too much, all day
We’re alive for now, all day
If I don’t like it, I hate it all, hate it all day
Every every every time, that’s all day
Every day, every day, I can’t do the same shit
These days hangin’ with cute girls, what you wanna do?
Where you wanna go? Get in the car and drive straight there
I don’t think about bullshit all day
Just wanna live in a positive way, all day
