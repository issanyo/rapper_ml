[Intro]
Dirt! Aye...
Dirty, Dirt Boys

We dirt, dirt
Dirt, dirt
Ohh

[Verse 1: KOHH]
I’m rolling dirty, but it’s pretty
This ink on my neck, artistic
Ksubi what I’m wearing
Damaged denim
Shirt is Y3
I buy too much clothes monthly
I cut high items with scissors


Head rich
Though I appear poor
Andy Warhol-like vision
Some people are like this
I am this way
And so are my friends
Let’s have fun
Filthy Dirt Boys

I won’t be cunning
And always stay honest
Get this bitch, I’ll sign her tits
Make everyone get dirty
New kicks
Onitsuka Tiger Asics
Weekdays are like holidays
Of nonstop weed smoking

[Chorus:]
Rolling dirty, Dirt Boys
Everyone is pretty, Dirt Boys
Shoulder-beating, full of pride, Dirt Boys
Dirt Boys
Dirt

[Verse 2: Dutch Montana]
Even if I stumble on bumpy roads, I rise
My skin hurts, so I scar it with tattoos
Deemed insane and pointed at behind my back
I get this everyday
But I let nothing bother me
Bitch
Aaaaw shit
Truly stupid
I smoke marijuana
So  I keep feeling positive
It’s a power that I summon
Dirty money
I bear the sins
If you’ve got a poor heart then love doesn’t last
Looking good is not enough
If you can’t understand what I’m saying now
You’ll get the meaning when you start missing people

[Chorus:]
Rolling dirty, Dirt Boys
Everyone is pretty, Dirt Boys
Shoulder-beating, full of pride, Dirt Boys
Dirt Boys
Dirt

[Verse 3: Loota]
Dirt
We don’t worry about getting dirty, we work
If you’re wondering why, the answer is it’s a cold world
No one has our ways
We got clean money though we’re the dirt boys
Look, my APC denim is clean
Get more fur, and find your feet
White Vans make my feet sore
But I get on stage regardless
The diamonds I wear, shine brighter than the sweat dripping on my neck
My hair can get messy
But she loves my long hair
It looks like a loose Chonmage
But i do not care
Let’s get dirty
From now on, we’ll do what we want regardless of the consequences

[Chorus:]
Rolling dirty, Dirt Boys
Everyone is pretty, Dirt Boys
Shoulder-beating, full of pride, Dirt Boys
Dirt Boys
Dirt
