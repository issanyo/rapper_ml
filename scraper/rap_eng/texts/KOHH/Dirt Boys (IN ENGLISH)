[Intro:]
Filthy Dirt Boys
We dirty, dirty
Dirt, dirt

[Verse 1: KOHH]
Filthy, but I'm still looking fresh
Artistic, tats all up on my neck (Tatted up!)
Damaged denim Ksubi, is how I'm dressed
Shirts by Y3, clothes every month I cop too many
Taking scissors to expensive shit (Woo!)
Looking like I'm broke, thinking like I'm rich
Some be on that Andy Warhol tip
Including me and my homeboys
Let's have a good time... Filthy fuckin' Dirt Boys
Never play dirty, I'd rather keep it real
Bitch get over here
And I'll sign on your tits
Everyone can get filthy and shit
New kicks, Onitsuka Tiger Asics
Weekends and weekdays, my homies stay lit

[Hook: KOHH]
Filthy Dirt Boys (Dirt Boys)
Fakes and Dirt Boys (Dirty!)
Brush our shoulders off and we're proud, Dirt Boys
Dirt Boys, dirt...
Dirt Boys, Dirt Boys, dirt... (x3)
Dirt Boys, Dirt Boys, dirt, dirt...

[Verse 2: Dutch Montana]
Even if the road is rough and you fall, get back on your feet
Scarred up my skin with all of this ink
Don't give a fuck about the days people pointed at me
And treated me like I was crazy
Bitch!
Ahh shit, being serious is for suckers
Stay smokin' marijuana
Always positive so...
Ya'll should read "Power"
If it's dirty money, bear the sin
If your heart's broke, must be love you're lacking
Frontin' won't get you anywhere
If you don't get the shit I'm saying, let me make it clear
Just look at those who already disappeared

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Loota]
We got work, don't give a fuck about dirt
Results over reasons in this cold world
A lot of people just can't say no
No dirty methods, Dirt Boys stacking that clean dough
Look, my APC denim are clean
Worn to death, frayed at the feet now they're more fitting
White Vans start showing their age
Still I get on stage
Sweat shining brighter than diamonds on a chain
My hair's fucked up, but whatever
She still loves my long hair
Ponytail like Vagabond but I don't care
Yeah, let's get dirty
Fuck the how and why, we just do what we like

[Hook:]
