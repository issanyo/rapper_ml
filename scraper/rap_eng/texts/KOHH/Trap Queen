[Verse 1:]
Hey, whatcha up to right now?
Getting Line messages and calls on my iPhone
The girl I keep in touch with is a good one
Whenever, wherever she’s a dime
Our lives are so fun
But haters bumpin’ gums
Jealous pricks, go to a sex club
Having a small heart, what a waste
Thinking of good things—always
“Thank you” not “Fuck you”
I hang out with the people I like
An environment you get when you see it
Life couldn’t be better, it’s no lie

[Hook:]
Everything around me, it’s all good
Good company and good friends
Everything around me, it’s all good
In my huge house writing a new track
Everything around me, it’s all good
Pushin’ a gold Range Rover, yeah!
Everything around me, it’s all good
There’s nothing I don’t need

[Verse 2:]
That girl’s fine
Where should we go? Where you wanna hang out?
How about a museum to look at some art?
It doesn’t have to be Japan, we can go abroad
Flying through the sky
MOMA if we pick NY
The Louvre if we go to Paris
Wandering around the globe

[Hook:]
Everything around me, it’s all good
Good company and good friends
Everything around me, it’s all good
In my huge house writing a new track
Everything around me, it’s all good
Pushin’ a gold Range Rover, yeah!
Everything around me, it’s all good
There’s nothing I don’t need
