[ENGLISH TRANSLATION]

[Intro:]
Oji, Tokyo
It’s all about my hood
It’s all about my hood

[Verse 1: Kohh]
Here’s what they said
If I wasn’t doing music, I wouldn’t been a piece of shit instead
Yeah, that’s it
No doubt but when it comes to other people I don’t talk shit (Don’t talk shit!)
If you wanna say it then be my guest and say it (Go ahead!)
All y’all talking suck a dick (Suck a dick!)
For real
No, no, no
The boys in my hood those real friends but I don’t need no more
There’s London and England at the station in Oji, Tokyo
I’ve already been to London though
We used to be broke but it’s all good now (Now!)
It ain’t just me, everyone’s doing great
That’s how I like it talk that good shit instead of hate (Talk!)
Taking too many sleeping pills, you’re making me worry
It’s just strangers and a whole lot of hustlers
But it’s…

[Hook:]
It’s all about my hood
I take trip abroad but when it comes to fun, It’s all about my hood
It’s all about my hood
Where the all the thugs hustle ‘cause that’s what they do
It’s all about my hood
Where I see drugs everywhere but I’m comfortable at, it’s all about my hood (Oji!)
It’s all about my hood (Tokyo)
Oji, North Tokyo, it’s all about my hood Yeah, yeah, yeah it’s all about my hood

[Verse 2: Y'S]
Lot of these fuccbois looking the other way
I hate what I hate, that’s all I ever wanna say
Somebody from somewhere, I don’t care
Don’t give a fuck about him over there
It’s nothing but bullshit that I don’t wanna hear (Shut up!)
Oji Oji Oji it’s number one (yeah)
Living how I want, this shit’s hella fun (Fun)
When we were young, hangin’ at Asukayama
Shit we did as kids, nothing’s real changed hah!
Cassette tape blamin’ kick push friends scooter ridin’ tandem
My OGs flew too high and died (R.I.P)
It’s all sad, nah that ain’t it
The friends I’ve got left… Man, Oji’s the shit!
Looking at the Sumida I used to always think that
One day we’d put this town on the map
There’s still a lot I wanna do though, so stand the fuck back
Started from zero, my hood’s the best muthafucka

[Verse 3: Kohh]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Good guys and the bad
But they all work hard
Can’t normally see my tats, but my body’s covered
All of a sudden they’ve got kids
Like they became adults but nothing changes (It’s the same!)
I wasn’t raised well, my heads probably fucked up (Fucked up!)
So what? (What?)
I’m proud to be born here!
That’s my hood (Oji!)

[Hook:]
It’s all about my hood
Take trips abroad but the good times, it’s all about my hood
It’s all about my hood
Where the all the thugs hustle ‘cause that’s what they do
It’s all about my hood
I see drugs everywhere but I’m comfortable there, it’s all about my hood (Oji!)
It’s all about my hood (Tokyo)
Oji, North Tokyo It’s all about my hood Yeah, yeah, yeah it’s all about my hood
