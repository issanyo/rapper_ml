[Hook: Kenny Turnup]
I just need the top to fall to sleep
Baby please don't stop until I'm sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep

[Verse 1: Kenny Turnup]
Chain on look like Ricky the Ruler
Got this lil' bitch she from Cuba
I taught her ass how to maneuver
I hit the block with my Ruger
This silencer got this shit long as a ruler
Hop out the whip with my
I hop out the whip with my shooter
I think I got enough friends, I do not need any more
We do not speak any more
I'm not in your league any more
I do not sleep any more
I'm on the block for the cook up
I'm on the top when you look up
Holy shit I got 'em shook up

[Hook: Kenny Turnup]
I just need the top to fall to sleep
Baby please don't stop until I'm sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep

レモネド, 貸すくらいと
ちょっと slow

言葉なんていらない
こ度だけあらばいい
貧乏には暇なし
お金もちと同じ
動くなければを終わり
Money mitchみたいに
誰に見ましな行きたい
気持よくめろう
I just need the top, fall to sleep

[Hook: Kenny Turnup]
I just need the top to fall to sleep
Baby please don't stop until I'm sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I be on the block don't get no sleep
Counting up this guap don't get no sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep
I just need the top to fall to sleep
