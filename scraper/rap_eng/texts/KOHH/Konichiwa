Stay low key shawty I don't want affection
I just want the top
Give me neck like a necklace
I be with my dogs
Check the squad, yup we flexin'
Get it out the ground, roll a pound
I ain't stressing
'Bout to go down hit my line
I ain't texting
Gucci made it Italy
So I don't need no dressing
50k inside my jeans
I like stretchers and pressing
Now I'm talking Japanese
Diamonds on me electric

[Verse 1: J $tash]
Bathing Ape ice cream
Undercover white T's
Human made, number nine
Why they want to bite me
My diamond chain so icey
Oh, I think she like me
Tokyo, Tokyo, Japanese, I might be
Me and KOHH getting checks like we work for Nike
Little niggas sending threats
I hit them with the nine piece
My choppa like my dime piece
Cause that shit just like five feet
Niggas wanna talk it out
Well that shit cost like five g's

[Bridge: J $tash]
Always on vacation
So I guess it's hard to find me
I pull up in that latest with my niggas right behind me
I'm in a two-seater with three bitches right beside me
Might just go tatt' my whole head like I'm YG

[Verse 3: Kenny Turnup]
Yeah, they say they got it, but I doubt that
Catch me out in Houston riding round, rolling loud pack
You say you a shooter, but I heard that you ain't 'bout that
Tryna run up on me, pussy boy I won't allow that
I been in the crib in the hills, getting high though
You been popping pill
Making deals with the five-0
Really get into it
What the fuck I gotta lie fo'
Why you wanna try me
What the fuck you wanna die fo'
Couple chains on me
5k for the freestyle
On the sly man I think I'm going senile
Running through this money
Laughing at these niggas meanwhile
The way she sucking feel like she don't got no teeth now
