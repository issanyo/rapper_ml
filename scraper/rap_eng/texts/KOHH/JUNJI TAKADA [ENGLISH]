I'm just living
And money, cash, hoes

Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
I don't care about others, that's my life style
Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
Fly boy I am living free
Cause I'm Junji Takada x4

I don't care about others that's my life style
Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
I don't think anything at all
Cause I'm an idiot

Go to sleep at night then morning comes
And now I'm thinking about when I'm going to sleep tonight

I got 2 rose tattoos on my left arm
Got tatted in the Philippines cause it was mad cheap

Back when I was studying English
I told my teacher to shut the fuck up and I had sex with my girl friend at break
For no reason, I just wanna fuck her
Don't think too much "mama"
I'll keep playing around grab some good food and then go to sleep at night when I wake up morning is coming

Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
You should learn from me and enjoy this life style too
It might look like it doesn't mean anything
But maybe it's meaningful
Well maybe
I'm sorry Im acting like I know
And I don't like to lie
I think being honest is a easy way to live
If I have a healthy body and pure mind I will be okay
If I had chance to go to Cali
I might learn "Teach me how to dougie"
Life is great
Thats what it's all about
When I feel tired I go to sleep
When I wake up morning is coming

Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
Up and down Junji Takada
Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
With naked girls in a bed
Do it any way I like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
I'm an idiot but I got fresh clothes
Do it any way i like
Cause I'm Junji Takada
Cute chicks and the whole squad
