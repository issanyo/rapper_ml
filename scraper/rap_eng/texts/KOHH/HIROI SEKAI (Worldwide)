[Verse 1: J $tash]
What
I ride around on forgi's
VVS, so gorgeous
I pull up to the club, looking so important
I'm trapping, getting drugs from Mexico imported
Got your bitch going up, on cocaine she snorting
I'm Randy Orton, she said that I'm so fly
Smoke kush, pop pills, baby girl I'm so high
Strapped with that steel, try me boy you gon' die
Kill or be killed, the rules that we go by
J $tash too trill, that nigga he's so live
Fuck how you feel, my nigga he gon' slide
Pop one, pop two, six halves, that's five
I'm eating burberry soup, in Tokyo outside

[Verse 2: Young Sachi / Andy Milonakis]
Whipping that crack like a big bowl of matcha
Leaving Tokyo, but I really don't wanna
Japanese mamas, hotter than a sauna
KOHH and $tash, got the cash, no more drama
Shots of sake, tonsil hockey, call me Young Sachi
So many little white boys, they all wanna copy
We stacking that yen, big time like Big Ben
Tom Cruise down Ginza, we a few good men
You see me in Shinjuku eating fugu with a bunch of hoes
That Kohh knows no NoDoz
Living slow-mo when I sip a four or more (?)
No domo
Arigato, fat boy lotto
Funky like Picasso, eating big bowls of nattō
Tokyo dreaming, bad boys scheming
Nikka 21 makes me turn into a demon
All these bitches free, so why you trying to pay?
We get more pussy than the cat café
Meow!
