Yahh Yahh Yahh Yahh
Hate Me
Aye Aye Aye Aye!

Don't start liking me
I have no interest in you to begin with
Cause I want to be more hated than liked
I hate that lip service shit
It's also worth living to destroy and remake
Rather than just to protect
The people saying "KOHH is the best" are the worst
No doubt about it

I always tell nothing but the truth
That's why i'm a liar
I don't really do future promises, I change how I feel everyday
That frequent talk of "I liked him way back, but now I hate him"
Before I knew it those people had turned into haters

New friends, I don't need them cause they're a pain in the ass
I prefer my friends from childhood always
Rather than rich businessmen
Even if i'm buttered up  and given gold
If its just superficial then no way
I don't know if they are jealous of if I am annoying
Either way they do talk shit

I don't mind if you're saying something on 2ch or social media
It doesn't always reach my ears anyways
I'm always with cute girls
Riding in the passenger seat of my Mustang
Is a girl that is the front cover of a magazine
I love girls and girls love me
But I've never liked those guys that look like girls
Praising each other while lurking where they can't be seen
Then half assedly getting along
As I thought it is good to be hated
We cannot live alone though each one of us

Don't care about being famous
Not only is it worthless, but also a pain in the ass
I don't know who you are but please leave me alone, for real
I'm not good at being liked
If I tell everyone that's like "KOHH KOHH!" to shutup
Obediently hate me straight away

There's a lot of people turning from a hater to a fan again
And how many more are there left turning from a fan to a hater?
The more that guy doesn't want to hear my name
The more he hates

Don't start liking me
I have no interest in you to begin with
