[Verse 1]
There's a place that I've found
As far as I can see
This place lies within
The depths of my dreams
In a garden surrounded
By fire and trees
Through the smoke a silhouette I can barely see
There's a man with an axe
Standing in the rain
Looked me straight in my eye
This is what he had to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Never fall asleep
You won't wake up
Destroy the guillotine
Before he does

[Chorus]
I walk with shadows
(you have to find a better way)
I walk with shadows
(the questions I will never say)
Hiding from the gallows
(they keep me safe and sound)
So I walk in shadows
(the ways of burning down this house)

End transmission
The satellites are down
I need an earthquake
To shake this pity
Off the ground

[Verse 2]
Just don't trust these liars at the door
(you have to find a better way)
Kill the ones that have these answers for
(the questions I will never say)
Never fall asleep
You won't wake up
Destroy the guillotine
Before he does

[Chorus]
I walk with shadows
(you have to find a better way)
I walk with shadows
(the questions I will never say)
Hiding from the gallows
(they keep me safe and sound)
So I walk in shadows
(the ways of burning down this house)

[Pre-Chorus]
End transmission
The satellites are down
I need an earthquake
To shake this pity
Off the ground

[Bridge]
All the vibrant colors I see
And the shades that fill the grey

Pain, The pain, Pain
The pain, Pain, The pain
Pain, The pain, Pain

[Chorus]
Hiding from the gallows
(you have to find a better way)
I walk with shadows
(the questions I will never say)
Hiding from the gallows
(they keep me safe and sound)
So I walk in shadows
(the ways of burning down this house)
