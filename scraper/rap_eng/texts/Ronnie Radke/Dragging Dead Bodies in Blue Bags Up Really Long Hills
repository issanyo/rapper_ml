Non fiction don't believe me
(That chances I have to take)
Betrayal at its best is always second guessed
Now I am healing the pressure so give me a reason now

[Chorus]
It's been so long and I've waited
I've been waiting for so long
Don't fight
It's hard to breathe when you're buried alive
You take this place for granted
And you realize it's never enough
I've been waiting so long (so long)
This will never end

The reflection of false hope
We kept the secrets in the dark
And the values of our brothers inside
The shadows I can see, see me perfectly
Their ratio is ten to 0

[Chorus]

Oh, we're on top of the world, let's go (let's go)
We're on top of the world
Oh (oh), we're on top of the world, let's go (let's go)
We're on top of the world, let's go

[Chorus]

Your death is written on paper
My heart is fueled by hatred, fueled by hatred
Dragging (dragging) dead bodies up really steep hills
