[Verse]
We've been blowing cash
I bought her every bag
Chanel, Louis, Gucci
We were popping tags
Give her what she likes
I hit it every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm blowing smoke just to get her off my mind
You know I'm blowing smoke just to get her off my mind
And I've been drinking all the time
Yeah, I been blacked out in my bed
Just to get her out my head

[Chorus]
I'm always looking for the next bitch
Or an exit strategy
You've broken me
I'm letting go of you
(Letting go of you)
You got me running for the back door
It's not what I ask for
Suddenly
(And suddenly)
I'm getting over you
(Getting over you)

[Verse]
She was always with me
Took her to every city
Paris, New York, LA
Crazy but so pretty
We bought all the bottles
She looked like a model
Now I'm popping champagne just to get her off my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'm blowing smoke just to get her off my mind
And I've been drinking all the time
Yeah, I been blacked out in my bed
Just to get her out my head

[Chorus]
I'm always looking for the next bitch
Or an exit strategy
You've broken me
I'm letting go of you
(Letting go of you)
You got me running for the back door
It's not what I ask for
Suddenly
(And suddenly)
I'm getting over you
(Getting over you)

(I know that you move on now
I think it's good cause I would fall down from you)

And I wish that I could take away the pain
I hope and pray that you will do the same
The same, the same, the same!

(Now you're gone I'm moving on
And I wish you never met me, never met me
I Wish you never met me)

I wish that I could take away the pain
(I'm letting go of you)
I hope and pray that you will do the same
(I'm getting over you)

[Chorus]
I'm always lookin' for the next bitch
Or an exit strategy, You've broken me
I'm letting go of you (letting go of you)
You got me running for the back door
It's not what I ask for
Suddenly (and suddenly)
I'm getting over you (getting over you)
