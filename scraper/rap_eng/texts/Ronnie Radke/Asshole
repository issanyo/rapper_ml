[Intro]
A man convicted of battery is on the run tonight
Ronald Radke, was found guilty for his role in the death of 18 year old *censored*
Falling In Reverse and former Escape The Fate vocalist, Ronnie Radke was arrested in Glendale, CA in an alleged domestic dispute with his girlfriend
The leader singer of that band got a little wild and crazy
This is near where the shooting happened more than two years ago

[Verse 1]
I got an insane posse, we ain't clowns though
I ain't a juggalo buddy, I was fucking Juggal-hoes
Yeah, maybe it's in my nature cause I never wanna date her
But she's like a shot of vodka cause I always gotta chaser
What's the fucking problem with a one night stand?
I'm never gonna settle down, you need to understand
And let me keep it simple I'm officially stable, and I won't miss you, here's some tissue, I got issues, believe me
And I always see my mommy in every woman I meet (why?)
Well I hate my fucking mother, motherfucker it's weak (fuck you)
So please believe me I'm a needy, insecure fucking freak
And it ain't easy or as dreamy as you thought it would be (check it)
Took her out to dinner (yeah), went and tried to kiss her (okay), opened up my eyes the fuckin' bitch was checking Twitter (what?)
Ladies, I ain't tryin' to be rude but, I'll never date a bitch who Instagrams her fucking food (eww)

[Hook: Andy Biersack]
Oh, I lost my fucking mind
It happens all the time
Cause I can't stand myself, I'm an asshole, baby
Oh, I'm fashionably late
I'm the one you love to hate
Cause I can't stand myself, cause I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 2]
I was up in the scene in mid-2006
I was automatically labeled as a goddamn prick
I go to prison and get out and then I'm back at it
I ain't afraid to go back, better watch that lip
But the music nowadays always sound the same
But it's pretty fucking lame what you fucking lames claim to be real music
And you gotta feel stupid to be still choosin' to abuse the privilege, and you still use it?
Lately all you bands do the same damn shit, same breakdowns, snare, kick, and lame ass riff
And everybody still fucking the same lame damn bitch, that comes to every show, showing her fake ass tits
But not me, I'm on a whole other planet
And I'll be damned if I sit back and let this fucking shit happen
I'm an assassin, with that music and fashion
When I cash out, no back tracks, I stack racks, I cashed in

[Hook]
[Skit: Ronnie and Andy]
Alright everybody on the fucking ground right now
Andy, here. (Alright)
You all are going to fucking die
Fuck you, fuck your tweets, fuck everything about you
Social media, my fucking ass
*Shooting and laughing*
I'm an asshole, baby

[Verse 3]
Last but not least, I wanna thank my fans
The best damn fan base a band could have
To show appreciation for how grateful I am, here's a mic stand, take it home to your dad
I got arrested for a crime that I didn't commit
And I never beat my girlfriend, she's a goddamn bitch man
The truth is she was pissed I broke it off, so what she did was calculate a plan to hurt me any chance she could get (damn)
Fuck it, her plot didn't work (nope)
The jig is up and everybody knows it's berserk
All you tough guys and wise guys, gangsters on that WiFi, are bitch made in your real life, in real life, I will fight
And just because I rock them skinny jeans and a belt, don't mean shit motherfucker I'll knock your ass out for real
Cause I'm pissed off, I'll piss on anybody cause I spit raw
I split jaws, I'm hip hop, I'll Nicholas Cage your face off

[Hook][x2]

[Outro: Ronnie and Andy]
Welcome to the fucking mixtape, 2014 and beyond
Me, Ronnie Radke and a whole bunch of other crazy mother fuckers (Andy Biersack, haha)
You don't like it go fuck yourself *laughs*
Now kids, it's just a fucking joke. Relax
