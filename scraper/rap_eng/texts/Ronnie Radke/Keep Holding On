[Verse 1]
I thought I had myself all figured out
But I spent my whole life holding myself down
And it seems to be that sort of thing I keep doing constantly
Addicted to the pain I cause myself
My head is floating somewhere in the clouds
While I'm paid to entertain a lively crowd
They sing my songs and feel my pain
Cause pain is what creates my fame
A vicious cycle some day I'll get out

[Chorus]
I can't believe I'm standing here at all
I can't believe I made it this far
All the way with a smile on my face
See the the top and I'm not falling off
And all I need is a microphone, I'll sing
About the things that have been hurting me
It's safe to say, all the kids, I relate
To their lives so just keep holding on

[Verse 2]
It's hard enough try walking in my shoes
To be picked on by my peers, too much abuse
And I'm tired of not fitting in, true friends is my final wish
Just let me be myself and make it through
I have tried so hard to be a better soul
I have worked so hard at making myself whole
And through it all, my better years are still ahead my mind is clear
Just trust me when I say I'm in control

[Chorus]

[Bridge] x2
I believe I'm just like you
I believe I'll make it through
It's hard to see at times like this
But I'm not giving in, but I'm not giving in

[Verse 3]
And all I need is a microphone
I'll sing about the things that have been hurting me
It's safe to say, all the kids, I relate
To their lives so just keep holding on

[Chorus]
