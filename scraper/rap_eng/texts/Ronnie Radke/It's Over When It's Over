[Verse 1]
I've got my life laid out in front of me like roads drawn on the map
I've had so many times where I slipped off the beaten path
I took the time to see the picture and for what it's worth
I'd walk a thousand miles without my shoes to make it work
I swore to God that I'm never coming back. Kept my faith when I was clapped
Staring at the wall through a crack in the floor. And these metal doors, they've got me trapped
I gotta remind myself that my mind is strong so that I won't lose my head
I've got my demons that I fight with, every little thought in every breath
I wear my heart upon my sleeve so my soul's exposed
And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost
God, can you hear me? God is missing

[Hook]
Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Sudden death, final round, without a doubt, it's over when it's over

[Verse 2]
You've got your life laid out in front of you, like a car crash
Unconscious at the wheel cause you were driving too fast
But if you took the time to check up in your rearview mirror
You'd see the things you're driving from or your biggest fears
You gotta get back up from the wreckage above and walk right through the fire
No matter what happens, the fact is that the flames keep getting higher
You gotta keep it going, keep tiptoeing through the fire and the flames and the pain of knowing
Through all this doubt, gotta keep on going, gotta give that spark, gotta keep on glowing
I wear my heart up on my sleeve so my soul's exposed
And I carry this disease, the weight of the holy ghost
God, can you hear me? God is missing

[Hook]
Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over

[Bridge]
So please, please, just let me make my peace
I refuse to let your words be the death of me
Please, please, just let me live my life
Stop living in my shadow and just make it right
It's over, make it right

[Hook]
Take it back, take it back, my friend
All the things that you said about the end
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over
Give it up, give it up, my friend
The score is settled even if you won't admit
Set it down, final hour without a doubt, it's over when it's over
It's over, it's over
This is it, this is me telling you it ain't over til it's over
