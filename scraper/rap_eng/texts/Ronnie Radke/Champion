[Verse 1]
I'm alive again
More alive than I have ever been
And now I'm climbing, climbing
To the top to win
And nothing's gonna stop, stop
Me in the end
Victorious

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And everyday that I awake
I say a prayer and I give thanks
That I'm alive and I am glad
That I've been given one more chance
My eyes are open now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds I've cleared my head
Now I am clean back from the dead

[Chorus]
Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down
I will stand my ground
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now

[Verse 2]
Look how far I've come
The wars that I have won
I think out loud
Victorious and proud
The years behind
The tears I try to hide
This pain won't last
Time to remove this mask

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My eyes are open now I see
The powers dwelling within me
I've done the deeds I've cleared my head
Now I am clean back from the dead

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Wait stop, stop
Hold on, hold on, hold on
I got this new head on my shoulders and I'm lookin' for justice
So gladly seekin' out bitches that decided to talk shit
You want conflict? Well I got it and I ain't gonna stop
Until I drop or take that motherfuckin' place on top
Ain't given it back when I take that place
As a matter of fact lets cut to the chase
Gonna take that spot on top of the list quick!
Call it statutory rape
You want some beef? Better bring a fork
Cause I'm never gonna pass the torch
Gonna keep goin' with the flows exposin' you hoes to show you I'm more important
A lil' bit of dirt mixed with the mud a lil' bit of rock mixed with a thug
Gotta good heart inside my chest and a lil' bit of gangster in my blood
Been to jail I've been to prison went to hell and had a vision
Was presented with a decision to change how I was livin'
Gotta give it up gotta give it back
I've had enough gotta get intact
As a matter of fact gotta get these kats in check and stack these fucking racks
Gotta get that cheese gotta get that bread gotta get that dough gotta get ahead
Gotta cut no slack to these motherfuckin' punks that held me down
Back from the dead go

[Chorus 2]
Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me

Whoa!
I rise above it all and I'm not coming down
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me now
And I'm not backing down (hey hey hey)
I will stand my ground (hey hey hey)
Whoa!
Because a champion is what they call me
Because a champion is what they call me now
