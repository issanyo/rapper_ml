[Verse 1]
Sexy girl, I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG, you make me complete
I'm looking for reasons
I'm begging and pleading
I'm dreaming of calling you mine
You keep me stu-stu-stuttering, stumbling
Fumbling over my lines
Without you girl, I'm not alright
I'm not okay
Yeah!

[Chorus]
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start
Yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Sexy girl, come and lay with me
I'm frustrated and it's sexually
Like OMG, you make me complete
I'm just being honest I'm creeping and crawling
I'm kissing the top of your head
We're rocking and rolling, we're touching and moaning
And making a mess of your bed
Can someone help? She shot me dead
I can't be saved
Yeah!

[Chorus 2]
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy

[Bridge]
God, if you are real, I need your help (Because this)
Girl has stolen my heart with her broken halo
And I can't deny she's so damn fine
Give me some advice

[Refrain]
Sexy girl, I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG, you make me  complete

[Chorus 3]
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start
Yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart
Yeah, yeah
And it's back to the start
Yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart
Yeah, yeah
Shot straight through the heart
