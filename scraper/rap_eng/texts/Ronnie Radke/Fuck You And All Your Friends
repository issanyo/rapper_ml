[Verse 1]
This will be the last song I ever sang
About a person that I'd rather not name
You think you're so goddamn cool
Everybody thinks you're a fucking fool
Crash and burn on a car ride home
It would be a lot better if I slit your throat

[Pre-Chorus]
And die for me, die for me
Why don't you?
Everyone will sing this song
And know they're better off without you

[Chorus]
I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking, and you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing, and it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever

[Verse 2]
I taught you all about breaking hearts
I didn't know that you would take it that far
I never thought after all these years
I would be the one to make you disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
And die for me, die for me
Why don't you?
Everyone will sing this song
And know they're better off without you

[Chorus]
I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking, and you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing, and it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever

[Bridge]
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends
Fuck you and all your friends

[Chorus]
I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking, and you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing, and it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever
I'm done with you for good
We were always like a time bomb ticking, and you're so Hollywood
You're always searching for the next best thing, and it's for the better
So I guess best friends don't last forever
