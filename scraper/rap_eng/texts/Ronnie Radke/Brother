I lost my way again
Through the storm
Through the wind
I'm falling short of what I became in the end
Everybody told me not to go
But my whole life I have known
That I'm something
That I'm something more

Yesterday my brother died
Driving to work
Damn, this shit really hurts
Man, I'm feeling no work
There were so many things I needed to say to you first
Now what the fuck am I supposed to do, bro?
Your kids are really missing you too, though
Dad is acting crazy and I had my first baby and I broke up with my lady old news bro
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me, you're never coming back but you need to help me
And I can understand why you're sad my brother
I know you hated mother but we had each other
And I know it seems like it was never enough
When the going got tough we would never show love
Cause the love that we needed was high on drugs
And I know she didn't mean it but we were way too young

I lost my way again
Through the storm
Through the wind
I'm falling short of what I became in the end
Everybody told me not to go
But my whole life I have known
That I'm something
That I'm something more

My mother died
A while ago
She isn't really dead but in my head though she is
When she did the unspeakable sin
And walked out on her kids and expect me to forgive
And that's fucked up not even a letter or call am I supposed to pretend that you weren't a terrible mom?
It's my first day of school and my night at the prom and I'm supposed to be calm? that's terribly wrong
And now I have a kid that I can not see because my baby mama fucking hates me lately
But I'll be damned if my daughter grows up without her father
And through the roughest waters I promise that I will watch her!
Lies and truths of every ounce of power til my final hours I will know about her
Mother you're a coward and your dediction devoured
Heather Freeman is your name and that's what I'll call you from now on

I lost my way again
Through the storm
Through the wind
I'm falling short of what I became in the end
Everybody told me not to go
But my whole life I have known
That I'm something
That I'm something more

So any children out there right now knowing that a parent has left you or a sibling close has died
It's okay to cry gotta get past it why the fucking sadness passes so dry your eye!
Lift your head up to the sky keep and your chin up it's time
Be strong for once in your lifetime you fight for the right to be happy even if the circumstances are crappy
The light at the end that you can't see
Just know now that I understand even if you aren't a fan of my band
I am glad that you took a piece of this song and ran
To a better place than where you're at
I am glad that I can help you on this road we travel
Through unwanted turns through the dirt and gravel
The battle's almost over the hassle of closure is closer to the end like a soldier you must keep your composure

I lost my way again
Through the storm
Through the wind
I'm falling short of what I became in the end
Everybody told me not to go
But my whole life I have known
That I'm something
That I'm something more
