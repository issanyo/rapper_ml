[Hook]
I'm already dead
Uh, I wasted time
I'm already gone, uh
Said goodbye
Will we be the only one
Sulkin' in the sun
Takin' it slowly?
And, if I'm not your only one
Then I'm done bein' your soulmate, ahh

[Verse 1]
Welcome to my world; a big ball of stress
Nevertheless, I am dressed for the occasion
Situation's complicated, I guess
Yes, it's all a mess
Everybody's always up in my shit
Bitches trip, throwin' shit like a gymnast
And friendships end over shit, like I'm sea sick
Shit, is it somethin' I said?
Somethin' I did? Is it all in my head?
Why does this happen to happen to me?
Why can't I always be happy instead?
The only time I'm great's when I'm on the stage
Gettin' praise, ragin' like a beast trapped in a cage
Gettin' torn up with a raw stick-slap in the face
Goin' ape shit on the world, like I'm Planet of the Apes
And I know, and I know
And I know our own life
This won't be forever
But I will, but I will
But I will survive...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my hell; where no one should be
The place I go every time I'm on the phone
With my baby mama screamin' at me
And this shit sucks, and I wanna give up
But I can't, and I won't
When the goin' gets tough
And it cuts to the core, like I sword to the gut
So I shove my feelings to the floor, and I run
Fuck, it's time to go
Yellin' and screamin', you know how it goes
I'm always leavin', you blow up my phone
I'm tired of fighting and losing control
Damn, I'm a dad
I never said I'd make a good one, it's sad
It truly bothers I can't be a father
Because you hate me so much, I can't stand
And I know, and I know
And I know our own life
This won't be forever
But I will, but I will
But I will survive...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I'm supposed to be 'that man'
And I'm supposed to be 'that guy'
Then why the fuck am I stuck in a rut?
I'm a schmuck, motherfucker, and I should try
Huh? I should die?...
Bitch, and you wonder why
I never call it right, cause I'm always on the opposite side of the phone gettin' the dial tone vibe
Alright, I admit it
I got a vice, I get it
I'ma use a woman as a object, it's a problem
A continent's worth of honest livin'
I can't help it, though
It's in my face at every show
With the combination bein' raised in a place
When every woman bounced, just the way it goes
(Just the way it goes...) [x9]

[Outro]
Will we be the only one? (One, one, o-one)
(What?)
Just the way..
Will we be the only one, one?
Just the way..
(Yeah, it's just the way it goes)
Just the way it goes [x3]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just the way it goes)
Just the way it goes, just the way it--Uh!...
