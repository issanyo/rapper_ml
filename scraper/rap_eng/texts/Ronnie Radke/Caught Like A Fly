[Intro]
Attention, attention everyone!
I got a couple of things
I would like to get off of my chest
Haha
Friends, who the fuck needs them?
You know who you are!
Eh hmm

[Verse 1]
Caught like a fly in a web of your lies
It's truth be told now
Or it's meet your demise
So how did it feel when you held the knife
That you stuck right in my back
A thousand times

[Verse 2]
Your grandfather would probably roll in his grave
If he knew of that person that you had became
I will not just lay down and take this
Not again, not again

[Pre-Chorus]
You have left my heart, black and blue
Just like your father did to you

[Chorus]
How does it feel, knowing you're barely alive
Seeing through bloodshot eyes, you're left empty inside
Where I was, strung out and drug through the mud
I must agree, you're just like me

[Verse 2]
And when you die I won't be at your wake
No eulogy from me, just a smile on my face
And while God might be busy with judging your soul
I will have slept with the girl that you loved most

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Just like me)
(Whooaaa)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm no fucking saint
But at least I'll fucking sing about it
Oh, the audacity!
