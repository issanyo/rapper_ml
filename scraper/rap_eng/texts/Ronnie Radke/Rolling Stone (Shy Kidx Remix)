I got my hand up on the throttle holding up a broken bottle. Ready to cut you open and gut you like a fuckin avocado. Desperado on the track, in fact if I am gone tomorrow then my motto is no sorrow, no apologies, that's karma. Don't get it twisted and delete me off your friends list, stayin busy tweeting hatred at me, all up in my business. I'm gettin kicks out of this shit like it was my sneakers. The game fears me like a motherfuckin wife beater
(scream-o) ...I'm always stayin true up in the city of blood. If you got a problem, now's the time to speak up, cause I'm rollin up, I'm never gonna stop
