[Verse 1]
My life is like a video game
Trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Trying hard to save the girl
Obstacles, I'm jumping hurdles
I'm growing up to be a big boy

I battle with the evil ways
I travel far, and try and save
Sorry but your princess isn't here
I take a rest, I push the pause
Level up, and move along
In hopes that the next stage I will clear
(I fucking passed asshole!)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just trying to keep from dying

[Chorus]
It's just a game that we play
And for heaven's sakes
Looking for a better way to play it!
Life is for keeping score and forever more
Stop complaining and start changing it

[Verse 2]
Today I went to therapy
Told him my embarrassing
Issues that I'm having with my life
He told me that I need to change
Life is not a video game
So stop playing and open up your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't talk about it, just be about it
Don't ever doubt it even when your brain is clouding
I may be crazy but life's amazing
And through it all and even with your problems facing
So just know that it's okay

[Bridge]
My life is like a video game
Trying hard to beat the stage
All while I am still collecting coins
Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Select Start

[Chorus x2]
