[Chorus]
I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I've got nothing to prove
But honestly, I'm just like you

[Verse 1]
I got a bad case of A.D.D
I've been this way since 17
I got a fucked up brain and a really bad attitude
And I blame it on my drug abuse

[Pre-Chorus]
So you don't wanna be too close to me
'Cause you might see my broken heart

[Chorus 2]
I am aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life the way that I want to
And you can't deny that honestly, I'm just like you
Just like you
Just like you

[Verse 2]
I've been so lonely for the longest time
They tell me that I'm such a lovable guy (yeah right)
Could it be because I'm off my meds?
Or could it just be something I said?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
I'm always stuck with some bad luck
I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
I hope, in fact, she breaks her back
The moment I step on this crack
Don't tell me I'm not worth it
'Cause you are far from perfect

[Break]
I am aware that you are all assholes
Who the hell cares about all of that though?

[Chorus 2]
