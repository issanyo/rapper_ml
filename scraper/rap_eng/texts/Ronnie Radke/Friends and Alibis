[Verse 1]
Oh, I hate to be the one to bear the bad news
Yes, it is true: I finally fell in love
I fell so hard, that I'm killing myself
Yes, I need help out of this grave that I've dug

[Pre-Chorus]
And, all the friends that I have gone through
And, how much I deserve the pain
It's a shame

[Chorus]
So hold your head, hold it up high
Here's to the friends that were alibis
Keep this close, by your side
When I come home, we will have our night

[Verse 2]
Oh, they always told me I was gorgeous in a way
And, that fateful day, I found who I was
So, I fill this hole with my prescriptions
I just keep feeding my addictions

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

You were the ones that stood by my side
And I was the one that fought all of your fights

[Chorus]
