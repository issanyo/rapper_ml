Sending shivers right down your spine
It's something that you're prone to so divine
You were better at lies (I was never surprised)
At the way that it felt
Now feel the blade (I was always insane)
But you're the one that needs help

[Chorus]
(Quick) We have the ransom
Tell me how that you can swim when ropes are wrapped around your limbs
(Below) There's no more chances
So tell me now that you can swim when ropes are wrapped around your limbs

Breathing slowly never worked for me
I cut the throat of betrayal to watch him bleed
A poetic sonnet passion that I scream to the sky
I'm tearing up I feel your love don't leave me behind
A poetic sonnet passion that I scream to the sky
I'm tearing up I feel your love please don't leave me behind

The smell of vanity went away
I followed streetlights till I wound up at your place
We traced our veins (we bled for days)
The current strong enough tonight
I can't taste any more
It lasted on my tongue
You weren't strong enough to say

[Chorus]

Grab my heart
Take this down
With your soul
And bury it in the ground
Go

I talked to you today
I heard the tremble in your voice (cradle the fall)
I know you'll never change so please just hold on
I know it's hard for you
It's hard to understand (betrayal within)
There is a fine line between betrayal (betrayal) and your friends

Tell me how that you can swim when ropes are wrapped around your limbs
(Quick!) We have the ransom
So tell me now that you can swim when ropes are wrapped around your limbs
