[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, I'm in love with you
But the world doesn't want me to
I'm not well, I am sick, the best kind of sick
That one can get
So you can't believe a word they say
About the person I am today
If all else fails, just think instead
At least you know I'm good in bed
So trace the lines of my tattoos
Whisper that you love me too

[Pre-Chorus]
We might as well, no matter what they think I suck
But I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

[Verse 2]
Hey, girl, let's get out of here
View the world in the rear view mirror
Just me and you with nothing to lose
Electric love and something to prove
So, please, take care of my hurt heart
'Cause trusting you is the hardest part

[Pre-Chorus]
You might as well no matter what they think I suck
But I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

[Bridge]
All your friends tell you I'm wrong
But all your friends sing this song
All your friends tell you I'm wrong
But all your friends sing this song, song
I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
So don't hold your breath for me
But watching you turn blue would be comforting
I told you once, I told you a million fucking times
I'll give you bad advice because, I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life

[Outro]
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I am bad at life, I am bad at life
I'll give you bad advice because I'm bad at life
