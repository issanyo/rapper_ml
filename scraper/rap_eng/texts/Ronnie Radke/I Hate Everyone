[Intro]
I had a bad day once again, please, leave me alone
There must be something I have missed, where did I go wrong?
You fucked me up, you have no clue, it's what I get for trusting you
You're the only reason that I hate everyone

[Verse 1]
I'm sick and tired of all the things that keep you away from me
You go run and tell your friends that I am the enemy
I hate this house, I hate your mom, and fuck your friends, I hate them all
You're the only reason that I hate anyone

[Chorus]
I hate anyone, I hate everyone
You're always talking shit behind my back
But smile to my face, what's up with that?
You're the reason that I have to hate everyone

[Verse 2]
So good luck on fixing me, and what we could've been
But you'll always fail to see I'm forever broken
I hate your guts, I hate his too, I hate myself for loving you
You're the only reason that I hate anyone

[Chorus]
I hate anyone, I hate everyone
You're always talking shit behind my back
But smile to my face, what's up with that?
You're the reason that I have to hate everyone

[Bridge]
Oh, my dear, I have seen better days
Because this is the worst day ever
And I do hate everyone but for you
You are the only exception
I hate everyone but you

[Chorus]
I hate anyone, I hate everyone
You're always talking shit behind my back
But smile to my face, what's up with that?
If you only knew the truth, I hate everyone but you
I hate everyone, I hate everyone
You're always talking shit behind my back
But smile to my face, what's up with that?
You're the reason that I have to hate everyone
