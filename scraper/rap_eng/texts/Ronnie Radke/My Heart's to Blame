So where do we all go from here
It's time to say goodbye
You're on your own

[Verse 1]
Walk away from all the pain
Found the piece with it again
And after all, I've seen and everything in between
My heart's the one to blame

[Chorus]
My heart's to blame
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own
And this is where I disappear
So turning back is what I hate the most
It doesn't matter anyways
I guess there's nothing left to say
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own

[Verse 2]
I ran away from my mistakes
Crashed and burned, and I'm okay
The most important thing, learning what it all will bring
My heart's the one to blame

[Chorus]
My heart's to blame
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own
And this is where I disappear
So turning back is what I hate the most
It doesn't matter anyways
I guess there's nothing left to say
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own
Goodbye, you're on your own

It doesn't matter anyway
I guess there's nothing left to say
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye
You're on your own

So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own
And this is where I disappear
So turning back is what I hate the most
It doesn't matter anyways
I guess there's nothing left to say
So where do we all go from here?
It's time to say goodbye, you're on your own

(My heart's to blame)
You're on your own
(My heart's to blame)
You're on your own
