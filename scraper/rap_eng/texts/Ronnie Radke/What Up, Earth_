Yo, what up, Earth?

Everybody here let me formally introduce myself
Gonna take a shot at that number one spot
Never gonna stop till that title belt is mine

Rain, hail, sleet, or shine
The harder the grind the sicker the line
From the bottom to the top
From the top to the sky
If the sky is limit then I've reached new heights
Yeah! Get it!
My mind is right
Better than ever
Better off alive
And I'll never let a motherfucking chance go by
As the seasons change so do I

"I got my money right"
Stacking every little pretty penny that I'm getting
And I'm never giving into anybody always winning
Never kidding motherfucker
I ignite the mic
With every line that I'm kicking like I'm sick in the mind
Just like I'm slipping my knife
I'm just waiting for that motherfucking time to strike

You ain't never been a punk to me
And you're lucky to be in a song I sing
Much less acceptable than the shit you bring to the table
Even able to sell CDs
God damn not a fan
And motherfucker you're a bitch
Never cross paths with a snitch
And asks but I pray I only use my fists

I'm waiting for the day I cross you off my list
You're motherfucking friends can suck my dick
Don't ever show your face again
I swear to god I'll cave it in

My mother never loved me
And my father wasn't home
So the other only option was to raise myself alone
Now I've come to know exactly what I can be
Better than what everyone expected me to be

My brother was a junkie till his daughter was born
He had no other option but to get out of the storm
Now he's come to know exactly what he can be
Better than what everyone expected him to be

Yeah! and by the way I'm okay
Don't really give a fuck what they say
Cause I'm a better man for the shit I had
To conquer really on a day to day base
And I've got to admit to the trails on denial and witnessing
Might still lose but I fight to win
Ten to the tens in a prison gym

I swore to myself if I ever left that place
That I'd never look back and I'd keep it straight
Etching my name on a wall in my cell
In the hole I spent 500 days
Oh! That shit is real
The DA forced me to take a deal
The world in my palms
The day in the dessert where I went to fight
Someone got killed

What am I supposed to do
I'm not a shooter but I keep it true
To my homies locked up
To my Vegas crew
I'll never say shit even if they do

This ain't pretend
Same sad song but I learned from it
Gotta make them deals
Gotta get them shift
You never make money without money to spend Oh!
I apologize to the people I hurt and Lord I try
To be better in a world where the wrong is right
It's hard to believe
Uncover your eyes

But a saint is what I never claim to be
But I guess it lives inside of me
Since the day that my mom's to blind to see
That walking away was best for me

My mother never loved me
And my father wasn't home
So the other only option was to raise myself alone
Now I've come to know exactly what I can be
Better than what everyone expected me to be

My brother was a junkie till his daughter was born
He had no other option but to get out of the storm
Now he's come to know exactly what he can be
Better than what everyone expected him to be

Goodbye earth
Everybody here from the bottom to the top I made myself
Better than ever is the best that I've been
And I'll never go back to the way I felt
The days I dealt
With the drama need help
My life in balance of living in hell
To the times right now where the light shines down
Never catch a frown on my face around

Surround myself with a positive group of grounded people
My sequel is where I found my feet
And I mean it when I say I'm mean
Believe it I've seen some things
But still to this day I'm breathing
You best believe I achieve what I want
And the need to be great

Walked in a dealership 60 k in cash
Bought a motherfucking Escalade
Escaped my fate not a dollar late
Now the meters short when it comes to hate
And by the way the shit you say
I got a pit-bull that will eat your face

Don't ever bite the hand that feeds your plate
Don't ever let a motherfucker bash your name
Don't ever let another sucker take your place
From the dreams you made and the bricks you laid
