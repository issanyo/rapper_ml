[Intro]
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
Oh, this is the end of everything that I've known
So come on

[Verse 1]
White boy on the beat rockin' Gucci sneaks
All I do is win, Charlie Sheen
Started out in '06 and revived the scene
So many motherfuckers wanna be like me
Came from the lowest of lows
Rose to the top with a vision
My haters talking shit while washing dishes for a living
Fuck you bitches, I'm a business
I'll be kissing on your missus
What you spend in 15 months is what I spend in 15 minutes
Oh don't give a fuck about you
You feelin' froggy, motherfucker?
Ain't a damn thing you can do
You're a bitch, you're a punk
Don't make me pull the pump
Cock it back and leave you slumped now thatâ€™s what I call bad luck

[Chorus]
Oh this is the end of everything that I've known
No way of knowing if I'll ever be home
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone
Oh and if I try to make it out of this town
No way of knowing if I'll ever be found
I don't ever wanna be alone, alone

[Verse 2]
I gotta lot of people talking nothing but chatter
Why'd you switch your style up that I don't matter?
Man I've been in rap since I was shitting in pampers
Climbed the ladder to the top and now I'm shitting on rappers
All I do is work, straight up hustle and grind
So many people mad at me for crossing the line
I find it kind of funny the shit you say in your tweets
But when we're face to face you ain't got nothing to say to me
Oh, so fuck you too
You better take a step back before I call up the crew
You talk a lot of shit but you spread nothing but lies
You keep on running your mouth, you better open your eyes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racin' a vet
I'm on that next, girl loves sex
No doubt I'm on top of the world break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck

I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet
Switching my lanes like I'm racin' a vet
I'm on my that next, girl loves sex no doubt
Now I'm top of the world, break your neck

I'm on that wreck, fly like a jet!
Switching my lanes like I'm racin' a vet
I'm on my that next, girl loves sex no doubt
I'm top of the world, break your neck
So break your motherfucking neck

[Chorus]

[Chorus + Bridge]
X2

[Outro]
Yo! 2013 motherfucker! Falling In Reverse!
