[Skit 1]
"Do I know you?"
"Yes, you do"
"This seems so familiar"
"You're in a dream"
"Who are you?"
"I am your reflection, you've been asleep for a very long time"

[Verse 1]
I lay awake every night, looking back on my life
Will apologies to the people I love for the things I've done, really make it right?
I guess it might, just then I realized
My past is the reason I'm here right now, as a matter of fact, I won't apologize
You bitches always pissed 'cause I am constantly changing
Think of how far that I've made it from my incarceration, it's amazing, ain't it?
But I'm in the zone, I'm a rolling stone, I'm coming home, but I'm not alone
Do I really got to let another motherfucker know?

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down

[Chorus]
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes

[Skit 2]
"Uh, daddy?"
"Yes, honey?"
"Why did you go to jail?"
"Uh"

[Verse 2]
I'm a lot smarter than you think, everything I did was planned
To get you to listen, to get your attention, so you post your opinion, and it gets me bigger
Are you triggered? Haha, figures
Here's the kicker: with every trigger, I'm getting richer from offended bitter little
Twitter bitches all up in my mentions, looking for attention 'cause they're starved of it
You wanna call me king of the music scene? I got news for you, I'm the god of it
Like the second coming
I respawn like I have a reset button, hated more than Trump is
Ronnie Radke's back to rapping, acting ratchet, release the Kraken, delete your asses
I'm not the rapture, I'm the motherfucking morning after

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I won't surrender, surrender
No, I won't let you bring me down

[Chorus]
So where the hell do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Like everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes

[Bridge]
I need a miracle
I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up, if I could make you see
I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me

[Skit 3]
"Dad, Dad, Dad, wake up"
"Ah, fuck, what the..?"
"You were having a bad dream"
"Where am I? Turn the fucking music off, who the fuck are you?"
"I'm your daughter"
"Oh, no, no, you're too old to be my daughter, what year is it?"
"It's 2033, Dad"
"Oh, no, no, it's not, no, no, no, no"
"You've been asleep for a very long time"

[Chorus]
So where the fuck do I go from here?
Who do I believe, who do I believe when everyone
Feels so insincere?
Everyone's out to get me
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me 'cause I'm really trying
I just kill myself sometimes

[Bridge]
I'm falling way too fast, I'm sinking in too deep
I need an angel now that's watching over me
If I could just wake up, if I could make you see
I'm all alone, all alone with your sickness in me

[Outro]
Who will save my life?
How do I believe, how do I believe in anyone?
Please, don't mind me
I just kill myself sometimes
