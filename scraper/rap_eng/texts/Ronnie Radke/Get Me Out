[Verse 1]
School is in another year
And I just want to disappear again, again
I hate the world, I just can't win
And sometimes I just wish it would all end
All end

1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 2]
I walk around with headphones in
A hoodie on, I'm trying to blend in
With all the other useless kids
That's how I've always been

[Bridge]
I know one day I'll be the king of the music scene
Like O.M.G

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

[Verse 2]
I'm a stereotype of a fucked up kid
And there's nothing really nice about the way I live
I got no money in my pocket, but I'm handsome and cocky
Start a band with my posse, beat the scene up like Rocky
I'm a lady winner, take your sister to dinner
And I may kiss her, but I won't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, big dreams, headed for the top
And I'mma sing my little heart out till the music stops

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

[Bridge]
And I know one day I'll be the king of the music scene
Like O.M.G

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

[Outro]
Just get me out
When everyone fails you
Just get me out
With nothing left to lose
Just get me out
I'm so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
Just get me out
So hope to believe, my hopes and dreams will get me out
Just get me out
