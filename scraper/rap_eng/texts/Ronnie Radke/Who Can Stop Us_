[Hook: Deuce]
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Watch us share this crown
Every time you step in, we push you out
Who can stop us now?
While the whole world bows
Try and bring us down
Every time we step in, we push you out

[Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
I rock hard, (no sleep)
Marriage, (not me)
My shoe game is so cold, see
Two reasons I got cold feet
And friendship is important
My gear is all imported
Deuce is on my chorus
Me and B.Lay gonna get that Forbes List
And I'm gonna straight roll to each state though
Gonna make a fuckin' killing on a bank roll
And can't ya see that I will compete
With any other rapper in the game, bro?
And I got this, cause I'm a locksmith
Got the game on lock
In a hot minute, and I'mma lose my cool
When I step up in the booth
'Bout to lose a tooth, cause I'm flossing
No oxygen bitch, I'm a glitch away
When I flip this motherfucker I got shit to say
Be cautious bitch I'm a twitch away
From snappin' on another fuckin' bitch today
Cause I'mma bench the weight
And I'mma get the cake
If anybody got a problem, I could demonstrate
To definition of a sauna, hotter than the summer
Park it undercover
I'ma beat the case of record
Trailer gonna, gonna, gun it like a gunner, put my foot up on the pedal to the metal, motherfucker
I'm a runner, and you wonder how I came up from the gutter
With a scalpel and a son of fuck
I swear I'm a part of ya'll on another level
I got turn up, gonna kill 'em with the thunder, motherfuckers gettin' dumber
Fuck you plumbers, suckin' shit up like a plunger
Everybody's got a problem, check it bubber
Anybody wanna solve it?
Get my number, fuck you harder
I'ma gut you like a motherfuckin' Glock

[Hook]

[Verse 2: B.Lay]
Born to win, most my niggas were born to sin, I'm born again
Rock with the pistol, all christian
I'll cross you out for steppin' in, with my crew
What it do?
Sup, dude?
Wit crew eyes
And new 2 Pac in the boondocks
I'm never givin' in to your rude thoughts
And I'm bangin' like a motherfuckin' boombox
Since age of two
Lookin' outside, seein' red and blue
With a sue, woo-hoo
And a goo-goo twos
And my coo-coo moon, so who are you to question?
Never hung 'round niggas that gang bang
Let their pants hang, do their damn thang
Let the pistol bang, and the booty sang
Gets past the jail with the booty train
So who's gonna stop me now?
Huh?
I rose from the ghetto to a different level
The motherfuckin' Devil won a hell of a hell hold
If Hell froze, (Hell nah)
Come walk in my shoes, see a different view
Want with your shoes
To be another motherfuckin' stat in the news
I planned it, boo
And you wonder why all my niggas like fancy jewels, baggy pants, and flashy shoes?
Been bobbin' the source and passin' dudes
I'm a fashion dude
I'm dat nigga doe
And my new back, and my new swag
And my new snap in that game
Yeah, I'm dat new, nigga' dat rain
