[Verse 1]
Tell me who you are
Your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars
My hope is that you'll make it through
Hate must never win
Even when we're worlds apart
Your love is not a sin
Even if it's hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I'm far
I will always be there

[Chorus]
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control
I can finally hear her message loud and clear
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
Transmission from the stars
A message from the atmosphere
Etched into my heart
Your purpose there is still unclear
The ghost of you lives on
Through everything I see and touch
And even when you're gone
Even if it's hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I'm far
I will always be there

[Chorus]
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control
I can finally hear her message loud and clear
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
A fallen angel is what you are
Your father has forsaken you
Left you with those scars
My hope is that you make it through
Hate must never win
Even when we're worlds apart
Your love is not a sin
Even if it's hard

[Chorus]
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
Don't let your fears take control
I can finally hear her message loud and clear
Hold on, my dear, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
