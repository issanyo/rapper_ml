[Verse 1]
I've watched my life flash right before my eyes just one too many times
I graced the devil's lips, her kiss of death but somehow I'm alright
I take another pill, so I won't feel the pain
This mess I made, I'll celebrate on the day I die
I am not alright
Show me the truth, I'm sick of the lies
Why must we pretend
Repeating this over and over again?

[Chorus]
Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same
Please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done?
Who can I trust?
I don't belong here
And I have lost my way again
Stay away from me

[Verse 2]
I've had this mindset that it's me against the world since I was born
Don't want your company, don't fuck with me, can't say I did not warn
I got my back on the wall, there ain't no person to call
I fall and get back up again
The only thing I've known, I do it on my own, alone
That's how it's always been

[Chorus]
Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same
Please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done?
Who can I trust?
I don't belong here
And I have lost my way again
Stay away from me

[Bridge]
Stay, stay, stay away
This is true, I'm telling you
Just stay, stay, stay away
Don't misconstrue, I'm warning you

[Chorus]
Stay away, this is your last warning
I am not the same
Please, do not adore me
It's not your fault, what have I done?
Who can I trust?
I don't belong here
And I have lost my way again
Stay away from me
Just stay away from me
Stay away from me
