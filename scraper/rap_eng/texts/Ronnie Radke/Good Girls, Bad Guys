[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh

[Verse 1]
You've got pep in your step
You live your life with no regret
How you look when you are wet
Is something I cannot forget
I just wanna kiss your lips
The ones between your hips
If I cashed in all my chips on you
Then baby, I'd be rich

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on!
Sexy, please text me
I'm ready for you
So come on!
Waiting, I'm begging
So please get here soon

[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh

[Verse 2]
Ooh la la, what lovely curves
Baby I get off by getting you off first
Sorry girl if this is quick
So please just take it in the ass and suck my dick

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on!
Sexy, please text me
I'm ready for you
So come on!
Waiting, I'm begging
So please get here soon

[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh Whoa oooh ohhh

Guitar!

[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

[Chorus]
So why do good girls like bad guys?
I had this question for a real long time
I've been a bad boy and it's plain to see
So why do good girls fall in love with me?

So why do good girls like bad guys?
(I wanna know, I need to know!)
So why do good girls like bad guys?
(So come on, I gotta know, I need to know!)
So come on, I gotta know
So come on, tell me!

Bitch, you gave me the fucking clap!
