[Verse 1]
Mother, where are you today?
You took a piece of me the day you went away
No recollection or the smell of your perfume
I took a piece of you the day I left the womb
(The day I left the womb)

[Verse 2]
Brother, put your needles down
The best thing for you is to leave this awful town
Pretty soon, you'll have kids to feed
If you see mother, tell her I can sing

[Chorus]
Please don't worry, I am doing fine
You're much too busy to even find the time
So use your chemicals and take this to your grave
The boys you left are men you didn't raise

[Verse 3]
And daddy, how are you today?
You must be proud of the boys that you have raised
Your withered heart, and everything it's seen
Your cuts and calloused hands, you had kids to feed
You had kids to feed

[Chorus]
