[Intro]
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through

[Verse 1]
I got that shit that you can bump in your car
Steady lurkin' on my enemies to settle the score
I am never backin' down until the day that I die
And I don't give a fuck about no hater on my life
I am the best as what I do and I will always prevail
And overcome all obstacles while walkin' through hell
And if you gotta problem now's the time to speak up
Because I'm blowing up, I'm never gonna stop

[Chorus]
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone and I'm in the zone
Don't let me fall, just let me know when we'll make it through
No matter what the price may be, for clarity I'll make it home
Just let me go, I'm on my own, a rolling stone

[Verse 2]
I spit the fire and I'm killin' the track
Ambitious from how many knifes are stabbed in my back
And if you think you know me then you're probably wrong
I spill my heart and soul so lock and load and keep bringin' it on
I got an anger that runs deep in my blood
And I'm always stayin' true reppin the city I'm from
And if you gotta problem now's the time to speak up
Cause I'm blowing up, I'm never gonna stop

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't get it twisted, ballistic, characteristics when I rip shit intricate
Visions of infinite wisdom empirical spiritual lyrical radical synonyms
In layman's terms I am the best you must agree
I got that white boy swagger rappin' right down to a T
I got my hand up on the throttle holdin' up a broken bottle
Ready to cut you up and gut you like a fucking avocado
Desperado on the track in fact if I am gone tomorrow
Then my motto is no sorrow no apologies just karma
Don't get it twisted and delete me off your friends list
Stayin' busy tweeting hatred at me all up in my business
I'm getting kicks outta this shit like it was my sneakers
And the game fears me like a motherfucking wifebeater

[Breakdown]
Just let me go, on my own again, a rolling stone, I'm in the zone, yeah

[Chorus] (x2)
