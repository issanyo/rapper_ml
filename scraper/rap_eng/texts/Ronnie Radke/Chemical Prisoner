[Verse 1]
I walk a fine line between coping and insanity
The right pills right now would be the wrong time
I have a hard time between flying and sobriety
The wrong thrill, strong will to keep myself alive
I've watched this rip apart my family
Fuck that, I'd rather die with honor
But when the drug is running through me, I can feel no pain
It's not worth the price I pay

[Chorus]
It's so hard to be together
And I try, and I try
But it won't get better
Forever
Days go, days go by
I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try
Forever

[Verse 2]
I missed a phone call from a friend I knew the other day
It was strange, and it changed my life forever
A couple days go by, I found out that he passed away
The right drug, wrong time, he'll be remembered
There's two wolves battle in us all right now
One's good, the other one is evil
If you're wondering which wolf inside will succeed
It's simple, it's the one that you feed

[Chorus]
It's so hard to be together
And I try, and I try
But it won't get better
Forever
Days go, days go by
I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try
Forever

[Bridge]
It's so hard to be together
And it won't get better
Days go, days go by
But I must, I must try
Forever

[Chorus]
It's so hard to be together
And I try, and I try
But it won't get better
Forever
Days go, days go by
I won't die, I won't die 'cause
I must, I must try
Forever

It's so hard to be together
Forever
It's so hard to be together
Forever
It's so hard to be together
Forever
It's so hard to be together
Forever
