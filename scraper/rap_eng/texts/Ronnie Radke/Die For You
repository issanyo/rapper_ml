[Verse 1]
I admit that I'm far from perfect
Who are you to judge me like I'm worthless?
I will not conform or be your puppet
I will never trust you 'cause the loyalty is dead

[Chorus]
I would've died for you
I'm killing myself hanging on your words
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Some things are better left unsaid

[Verse 2]
You won't destroy me
This is your warning
I have a dark side, I have an army
Within me, a secret
A thousand years of torment
Caged up like a monster
Forever I will wander

[Chorus]
I would've died for you
I'm killing myself hanging on your words
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Some things are better left unsaid](6521694)

[Bridge]
Break it up
I'm no longer able to believe in what you are fighting for
Your lying soul will burn below
And I hope that it happens slow
Tell that bastard that you call your father if you bother
That he should have raised you with a heart
And taught a bit of honor

The world as we know it is a motherfucking battle ground

[Chorus]
I would've died for you
I'm killing myself hanging on your words
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Somethings are better left unsaid](6521694)

I would've died for you
I would've died for you
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Somethings are better left unsaid](6521694)
Better left unsaid
Said
