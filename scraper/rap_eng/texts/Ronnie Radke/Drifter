[Verse 1]
As I'm thrown into an empty room, or should I say a box
I try to turn around to leave but the door is slammed and locks
So I sing here and think about all the evil things I've done
I lost where I was going cause I forgot where I came from

[Chorus]
I surrender, put my weapons down
I can't remember what I'm doing in this town
It's time for me to pack my bags, I will always be alone
The only thing I've ever known is out there on the road

[Bridge]
I'm a drifter
I'm a drifter

[Verse 2]
Now every time I look straight into my fathers eyes
I see how hurt and broken down he is from all the times
He had to watch the son he raised follow in his steps
The only option that he ever had was to hope for the best

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My faith is weak, my soul is bound
This lonely road I travel down
I scrape my feet, this jagged ground
The cuts run deep into me now
Mother oh, why aren't you here?
So young I was, you disappeared
I know the truth is ugly, did you ever truly love me?

[Outro]
I surrender, curse my mother's soul
I still miss her no matter where I go
It's time for me to pack my bags, I will always be alone
The only thing I've ever known is a broken home
