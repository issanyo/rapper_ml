[Verse 1]
So grab this statement
And read between the lines
I'm walking on an edge
That's how I stay alive
I need a fix now
The pills I have to take
It helps me live a lie
And blinds all my mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
Before I die
I will have seen it all
The mountains I have climbed
Help me enjoy the fall

[Chorus]
Oh the webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passion's dead
The life you've lead
Has drowned in your shame
Oh the webs I weave
I am caught in this game!
My passions dead
The life I've lead
Has drowned me in vain

[Verse 2]
So paint my portrait
The colors of my life
And the untold stories are painted in black and white
I can hear the footsteps
That follow to my pulse
This paranoia has haunted me like a ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
Before I die
I will have seen it all
The mountains I have climbed
Help me enjoy the fall

[Chorus]
Oh the webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passion's dead
The life you've lead
Has drowned in your shame
Oh the webs I weave
I am caught in this game
My passions dead
The life I've lead
Has drowned me in vain

I will have seen it all
I will have seen it all

[Verse 3]
I'm killing time
Let me go
(Before I die)
(I will have seen it all)
It reads their minds
Brings them close
(Before I die)
(I will have seen it all)

[Chorus]
Oh the webs you weave
We are caught in the fame
The passion's dead
The life you've lead
Has drowned in your shame
Oh the webs I weave
I am caught in this game
My passions dead
The life I've lead
Has drowned me in vain
