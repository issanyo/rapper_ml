[Verse 1]
Well I'm not a vampire but I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always aching
And the dark is when I feed
Well I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me
And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers better lock your doors and hide your daughters

[Chorus]
I'm insane
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins
When did I become so cold?
For goodness sakes
Where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is
Then my heart has lost all hope

[Verse 2]
Well I'm not a zombie but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision
And my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby
Cause I'm always throwing up (Blew!)

Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict (Hi, Ronnie!)
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
God bless all of you now
Cause I'm going straight to Hell
And I'm taking you down with me
Cause you know damn well

I'm insane
Well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins
When did I become so cold?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All hope
All hope
