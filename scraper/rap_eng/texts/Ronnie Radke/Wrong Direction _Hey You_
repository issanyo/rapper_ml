I got this girl up in my brain, and its impossible to stop
With the thoughts that I be thinking you would think it wasn't wrong
Until the day I gained up the courage to be strong
I'll tell her to her face, naah I'll tell her in a song
Hey you I just wanna let you know
I got this thing for you that i cannot control
Im very sorry if this sounds a little bold
My love for you has got a mind of its own
Hey you, Im never gonna be the same again
Hey you, I really wanna be way more than friends
Hey you, Im hoping you can feel like this
Im never gonna be the same again
Cos girl you are a perfect ten
