[Intro]
Hahaha
Oh my god, that'd be amazing
?bad girls club

[Verse 1]
I met a girl and I really thought she liked me
I truly thought that I had met the one
It was a fail, to no avail
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club
She's like a witch, casting spells, hypnotizing
She'll make me drink a potion just to fall in love
She got me drunk, tipsy off her love
I'm just another victim of the bad girls club

[Break: Girls Chant]
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey

[Verse 2]
She's always blowing up my phone
I really wish that she'd leave me alone
I gotta change my number, hard for me to slumber
When she's outside my home
She called the cops
And made it seem like I was mean
She's not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Spelled c-u-n-t (bitch!)

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time

[Chorus]
I'm calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight
It's getting lame, so olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls' club

[Verse 3]
I’m always paranoid (Yeah I’m paranoid)
That she’s somehow watching me
Follows me on Twitter, asking if I miss her
Hash tag set me free
She Googles my name just to keep some tabs on me
She’s not your average lady, she is fucking crazy
Someone help me please

[Pre-Chorus]
And after all the rise and fall
You're not worth my time

[Chorus]
I'm calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight
It's getting lame, so olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls' club

[Bridge: Ronnie Speaking]
Alright, alright, alright
Settle down, settle down
I need all my bad girls in the house tonight
To help me do a cheer, it goes
1,2,3,4

[Bad Girls Club Cheer]
Hey sexy boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn’t mean much
(Your love is like a drug but it is not enough)
Give me a B-A-D
We’re the bad girls' club
Hey sexy boy I got you wrapped around my finger
L-O-V-E really doesn’t mean much
(Your love is like a drug but it is not enough)
Give me a B-A-D
We’re the bad girls' club

[Chorus]
I'm calling it quits, right now, this time
You're playing games, and all we do is fight
It's getting lame, so olly olly olly oxen free
All the bad girls come cheer with me
Your love's a drug, you got me on the run
I’m just another victim of the bad girls' club

[Outro]
I’m just another victim of the bad girls' club
I’m just another victim of the bad girls' club

Ronnie (giggles)
