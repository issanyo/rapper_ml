B. Lay.:
Shout out to my motherfucking friends, all we do is win
Shout out to my homies in the pen doing ten
Shout out to my motherfucking hoes all across the globe, pretty girls love me every where I go

Ronnie:
I got that double r, that stands for rapping and rocking
I got them battle scars I brush it off and keep walking
I've been to hell, every level, sold my soul to the devil
But this music's theraputic, it's what keeps me together

I'm never gonna slack, motherfucker gonna get it
You rat motherfuckers always snitchin'
If anybody gotta problem cause I'm good at bein' honest when I started from the motherfucking bottom?
I never wanna miss my chance again, I'm stackin' all my chips every chance I get
Cause I'm back to the motherfucking lab with a mad rap on a fast track with a pad and a pen

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think
Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man
This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

B. Lay.:
Look so follow me all of me as I marvel in this life
So many people want the fame; Fuck that! - Fuck that!
I fucked with a ouija board at least three lords
You can say I'm about that life, nigga
When it comes to my team I'm a bleed for them when they bleed for me, nigga
Cash mixed with stash in the backpack on the 'ave' 'till after dark, nigga
Raps in the back half, snows in the front half, it's blowing my mind, nigga
Who knew in a few moons my first tattoo would have rung true
No sympathy for the dead when I ETF, my destiny came true, nigga

Ronnie:
Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Never settle for lesser in life you feelin' my vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think
Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man
This is how you made me America, this is how you change me America
I am on your black list America
(Re)member beyond, beyond the mask there is a man

Don't push me motherfucker, I got that game on lock
Hip hop with a little bit of rollin' rock
I gotta get every itty bitty tid bit of every penny 'till the motherfuckin' day the music stops
Gold, motherfucker, from coast to coast
Got alot of fucking passion, I be killin' the flow
Ain't nobody hotter, gonna burn up like I'm sauter, cauterize the fuckin game like I go for broke

B. Lay.:
As I choke on smoke, pulled a gat on a nigga feeling overdose for raping my mother in his overcoat
It's never over-bro 'till your soul's exposed

Ronnie:
Cha-ching, Oh. Sick & twisted
Killing little bitches like I'm Mr. Vicious
Leave you in a motherfucking sack with a black mask and a red cap, motherfucker, limp bizkit

Severe the ties, I'm better than ever alive, doing it right
Right fuck you, you feelin' my vi-vi-vi vibe?

Ha ha

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think
Say it again & again; beyond, beyond, beyond the mask, there is a man

Yeah they put me on my knees
Yeah they taught me how the fuck to think
