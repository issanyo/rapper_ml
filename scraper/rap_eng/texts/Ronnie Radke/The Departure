[Verse 1]
Pray for me, my friend
I have reached the end
Heaven well is a fairy tale
So I will now descend

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all the same, I was wrong, you were right
And when I was born, all the angels cried
I spend every night in a waking dream
While the devil sings to me; somebody, set me free

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what have I done?
Who's this person I've become?
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free

[Verse 2]
Today I say goodbye
I've gotta leave you all behind
Heaven's Hell, so wish me well
'Cause I must now descend

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's all the same, I was wrong, you were right
And when I was born, all the angels cried
I spend every night in a waking dream
While the devil sings to me; somebody, set me free

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what have I done?
Who's this person I've become?
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free

[Bridge]
Somebody, set me free

[Chorus]
Oh my God, what have I done?
Who's this person I've become?
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free

[Outro]
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free
And it's all the same, and it makes no sense
And I walk this line, and I'm on the fence
Between right and wrong, it's the same old thing
'Round and around I go; somebody, set me free
