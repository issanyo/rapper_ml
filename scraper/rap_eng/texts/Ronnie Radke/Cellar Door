[Verse 1]
We walk through the doorway, heard you calling from the hall
To find you in the bedroom not breathing at all
I drag your body to the cellar where we lay
The wax it melts away, I kiss your face

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we are starting to love you more
Your body's on the canvas, I painted on the floor

[Chorus]
Now you wait
Like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on
For so long
And oh
How it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone
It's so wrong, it's so wrong

[Verse 2]
If I could take you somewhere, I'd take you to the darkest place
Scatter you in art forms, admire the whore
Beauty in different ways, your hands on picture frames
Your eyes in the glass wear your face as a mask

[Pre-Chorus]
Now they are starting to love you more
A gallery of your beauty, no charge at the door

[Chorus]
Now you wait
Like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on
For so long
And oh
How it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone
It's so wrong, it's so wrong

[Verse 3]
And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold
And down below your veins run dry your vacant eyes
I lost control your face is pale, your body's cold
(Your face is pale, your body's cold)

[Chorus]
Now you wait
Like the drug, like the change in the pain it goes on
For so long
And oh
How it hurts in the worst way, now that you're gone
It's so wrong, it's so wrong

[Outro]
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
It's so wrong
