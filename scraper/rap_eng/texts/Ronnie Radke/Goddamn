[Verse 1]
My words cut just like razor blades
And I'm just like a hand grenade
You pulled the pin now you're too late
Excuse me while I detonate
You live the life of luxury
Deep down inside your misery
Subsides and thrives for company
Now morally you're crumbling

[Chorus]
Goddamn, need some help
I can't help myself
Cause my girlfriend's in love with someone else
(Love with somebody else)
Goddamn it's too bad
Really wished it would last
Always wanting what I'll never have
So goddamn

[Verse 2]
My nerves are right on edge today
And I just might cave in and break
I must forgive I hesitate
Excuse me while I separate
You lived the life and lied to me
I gave you almost everything
I wore my heart upon my sleeve
I gave you almost all of me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Goddamn, need some help
I can't help myself
My girlfriend's in love with someone else
Goddamn it, what the fuck?

[Chorus]
