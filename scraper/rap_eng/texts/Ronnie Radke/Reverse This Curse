[Verse 1]
A withered past and a blurry future
My hearts on an auction
It goes out to the highest bid
I live too fast, and I know I will lose her
But there is an option, to die is to live in her head
So I'll hang on, never let go
I dug this pain into my chest instead

[Chorus]
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose, so let me tell you the truth

[Verse 2]
A deadly wish but it should've come sooner
A corpse in a funeral that I would never attend
There is a light on in the back of this house
But you're not around, to die is to live in her head
So I'll hang on, never let go
I dug this pain into my chest instead

[Chorus]
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth

[Verse 3]
So, this goes out to the ones that fall in love
And to the girl that filled my dark
Last night I had the weirdest dream
That you and I drove up the darkest streets
Passing through these city lights
Closure for the kids that died

[Chorus]
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth
One last chance to reverse this curse
You stole my heart but I had it first
And now I see you've got something to prove
And nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth

[Outro]
So, this goes out to the ones that fall in love
And to the girl that filled my dark
