[Verse 1: Ronnie Radke]
From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the Devil
After all the dust had settled
There's an hourglass of time
Counting down all of the lies
And with every grain of sand
Time is slipping through my hands

[Verse 2]
Oh!
I sold my soul to Rock and Roll
I let my demons take control
Redemption seems so far away(Away)
This microphone is my escape
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't mess with ouija boards
Cause now my spirit's torn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm bound by fear
Of being trapped
I'm falling faster
Fade to black
Something's standing
In my way
Hoping for...
Better days!

[Chorus]
I'm always searching
For serenity(Better days!)
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality
Oh....

[Verse 3]
I spill my heart out on the stage
The only way I feel o.k
And right before that curtain calls(And right before that curtain calls)
I just got one more thing to say
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Refrain]
From the depths of Hell
So far I fell
A deal made with the Devil
After all the dust had settled

[Verse 4]
Look into my eyes
You will see the light
It burns so bright
This flame will never die
I speak the truth
Immortalized by youth
No other way
Until my final day

[Verse 5]
Oh!
I feel the hate
Welling up inside
And it's too late
Nowhere to run and hide

[Refrain 2]
Don't mess with ouija boards
Don't mess with ouija boards

[Refrain 3]
I'm bound by fear
Of being trapped
I'm falling faster...
Better days!

[Chorus 2]
I'm always searching
For serenity(Better days!)
And I'm always standing
At the edge of reality
Oh!(Better days!)
[Chorus]
[Refrain 4 (2x)]
Don't mess with
Ouija boards(2X)
