[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamed of you again
You swim your way up through my veins
Into my soul until you've reached my brain
You are the greatest part of me
So if dreaming's the only time you're near
Then waking up will be my nightmare

[Pre-Chorus]
At that very moment, I jumped out of my bed
Trying to remember all the things you said
It was: "Ronnie, I adore you, but nothing really lasts forever"

[Chorus]
You gotta let me know
Don't leave me hanging and complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
Don't leave me hanging on

[Verse 2]
I am a lesson you will learn
I'd take away your pain and hurt
But I'm not strong enough to be your cure
I am the battle you will lose
You think that you are saving me
But I'm the one that's saving you so

[Pre-Chorus]
And at that very moment you appeared in my bed
Looked you in your eyes, and then I finally said
It was: "Baby, I adore you, but this ain't gonna last forever"

[Chorus]
You gotta let me know
Don't leave me hanging and complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
Don't leave me hanging on

[Bridge]
This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor

[Chorus]
Don't leave me hanging and complicate it
All we are is setting ourselves up to fall apart
Don't leave me hanging on

[Bridge]
This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Slit my throat, I'll die with honor
This is all I have to offer
Sacrifice me on your altar
Like a lamb to the slaughter

[Outro]
Don't leave me hanging on
Don't leave me hanging on
