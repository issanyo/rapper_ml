[Intro]
Iâ€™d die before I let you in

[Verse 1]
Lost in a moment of time
Self-destruct, switch on
I try
But it happens the same
Every day

[Chorus]
Here I go, standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it, this is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again
As I look up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
It's all the things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

[Verse 2]
Stuck inside this fucking mind
Goodbye
I will shut down
Mission abort, down for the count
Stuck in a cycle, trapped in a nightmare
Losing what matters
See if I fight fair

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge] x2
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
This is where I can't be
Get away, get away
I just want to be happy

[Chorus 2]
I set sail on a voyage unknown
Aboard a vessel that I call my soul
And I've been searching for what makes me whole
Sinking in the ocean on an empty boat

Take me home
I'm lost, alone, alone

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
That it's haunting me
