[Verse 1]
I think it's finally sinking in
I am nothing but a product of your sins
Hoping for the best, but now I steady watch your hands of time, oh
Moving like a guillotine, and swiftly counting down my life

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down, even if the world was ending now
We are the broken, but don't cry for me

[Verse 2]
I think I finally understand
The world is spinning off its course, all part of the plan
Like a Phoenix from the ashes, I have risen from the deepest grave
And the only thing I love is the only thing that keeps my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
And it goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down, even if the world was ending now
We are the broken but, don't you cry for me

[Bridge]
We are a revolution
We are the indigo
And we will never give up, never let go
So what's the resolution?
And even if the sky comes crashing down
Even if the world was ending now

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
We are the broken, hoping for a change of heart
We are the chosen, praying for a shooting star
And even if the sky comes crashing down, even if the world was ending now
We are the broken generation, it goes on and on and on
