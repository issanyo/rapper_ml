[Verse 1]
R. R. versus the whole damn state
No girls on the jury I done lost my case
My attorney’s nevous what the judge will say
About that fresh tattoo up on the side of my face
I got your bitch sending flicks to me naked
I be rocking stages while you’re minimum wagin’
Ha, no guns in my waist man
But I know a few dudes that are down to catch a case man
And ill welt you up and I’m down to scrap
As a matter a fact you better get back
Motherfuck clit clat attack
Everybody with a Mac sitting in the back of class fucking strapped
Amanda Bynes (Columbine)
Maybe I’m crazy, amazing in the cranium, praying for haters to actually face me

[Hook]
I’m just a stupid boy and I know why
Spendin’ all my time on the wifi
And I wonder why (Why)
I do not have a life
All I wanted is a bitch to fuck me (Fuck me)
But all these stupid bitches want to love me (You’re cute)
But inside I am ugly
U-u-u-u-u-u-u-ugly

[Verse 2]
Made about a mill this year
Made a big impression
Bitch, I am here
I fucked the game up
You can call it sodomy
My record label’s acting like they just won the lottery
Ha, my girl’s a temptress
Man I got a girl, baby mama, and mistress
“What? You got a mistress?”
“No, no, no, it’s not what it looks like, it’s just rap.”
“What?!”
“I’m just kidding. No calm down, it’s just…”
“OH MY FUCKING GOD”
HAHA I am not kidding
So much pussy I am tripling digits
Yahh
While I’m still standing
While out on your bitch like my name is Nick Canon (Canon)
Who wants to start shit?
I’m the darkest, sharpest blade but I sharpen
Rawest fuckin’ beef in the market
You’re harmless
Grab a carpet
Wrap your carcus in it
I’m far from finished
Bury you in the back of my garden wit it!
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, it’s the first of the month)
When I open my eyes ‘till the time that I close ‘em, I’m a soldier, supernova, broseph
(Get up, get up, get up, ‘cause you gotta get up)
Gotta get dat money, never gonna fold up, I’m tired of sleeping on the sofa
Is this what I’m supposed to be?
A motherfuckin’ cracker, it’s in my genes
I rap better and faster than anybody in the rap scene, I’m already rocking
Get it? Rock king, as in the crowns on me
And I’m rocking the boat on my time
And so please
Don’t quote me and I won’t squeeze
This motherfuckin’ pen, bitch
It’s like a gun
It’s fun when I pull the trigger
On the paper
Confrontin’ every motherfuckin’ hater I’m huntin’
(I’m beginning to feel like a rock god, rock god)
Word to Em and Dr. Dre ‘cause they’re the reason I rock this way DOG

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
R. R. versus the whole damn earth (earth)
I’ve been this way since my fuckin’ birth
I told you foreign fucks I ain’t a Ukrainian
But I’m Russian
Get it? At your cranium (ha ha)
Ooooh, he is so witty (thanks)
Ooooh, he is so pretty
Now kids, (yeah)
Don’t do drugs (Okay)
I’m kidding, get it?
They’re so much fun
Rap and rocked, rolled into one
Lock and loaded with ammo
Stocked and stowed away with guns
Unless you rock and rollers decide to talk and bolster
Who’s got the biggest Glock and holster
I suggest you do not open your mouth and run
Get back
Better watch out here I come DOG
Get sacked
Ready to attack anybody let’s play ball
It’s fourth and inches
Gotta swarm defences
Gotta get that goal
Gotta score the winnin’ touchdown with my nuts out
I’m a Viking bitch
And I punish towns
Fuck you bitches
Politican, I"m defined misogynistic
My hatred for women growin’ bigger with each day that I’m livin’
Some masochism lovin’ the crap that I’m spittin’
After the fact I wrap it in bow
And givin’ it to hoes in your home on Christmas
Happy Hanukkah
Feliz Navidad
Happy New Year
Now take off your bras
I told you broad that your pussy is bomb
And I’ll fuck you whore like you never been fucked before
Ah, ah, ah

[Hook]
