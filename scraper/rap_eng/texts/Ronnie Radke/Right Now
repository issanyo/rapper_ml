[Verse 1]
Hello, earthlings, your favorite alien's back
I crashed my spaceship, but here's my plan of attack
Sit back, relax while I talk a bunch of crap on this track
I'm sick of hatred, self-righteous humans pretend
That momma's basement is not the place that they live
They stay up all night long, complaining on vlogs

[Chorus]
Right here, right now I'm gonna tell you how
I could give a fuck what you're about
You think you're cooler than me, but you're not what you seem
You're riding off my popularity
All I'm saying is: "Oh, don't come around here and act like you're my friend"
You keep on reeling me in and selling me out
So I could give a fuck what you're about
Right here, right now

[Verse 2]
I hate the media and how they spin every word
I killed a puppy, but I cuddled him first?
And if you think that's bad you should know there is worse
I'm not a bad guy, it's just my reputation is fucked
But I'll embrace it, I got no other choice, and it sucks
If you don't think that's wrong, you're as dumb as this song

[Chorus]
Right here, right now, I'm gonna tell you how
I could give a fuck what you're about
You think you're cooler than me, but you're not what you seem
You're riding off my popularity
All I'm saying is: "Oh, don't come around here and act like you're my friend
You keep on reeling me in and selling me out
So I could give a fuck what you're about
Right here, right now

[Bridge]
Mother, have your mercy 'cause the worst is yet to come
Sorry that I'm emo in the middle of this song
But we are tragically hard to please
Mother, have your mercy 'cause the worse is yet to come
Ah, does Ronnie Radke have to smack a bitch? Too soon

[Chorus]
Right here, right now, I'm gonna tell you how
I could give a fuck what you're about
You think you're cooler than me, but you're not what you seem
You're writing up my popularity
All I'm saying is: "Oh, don't come around here and act like you're my friend"
You keep on reeling me in and selling me out
So I could give a fuck what you're about
Right here, right now

[Post-Chorus]
Tragically, tragically
Right here, right now
Tragically, tragically
Right here, right now

[Outro]
Get off of the internet and make some fucking friends
