[Intro Skit]
Charlie, what are you barking at?
Charlie, I'm trying to sing a song, you gotta go
Charlie, go. Ahem

[Verse 1]
My mind is like a puzzle or a rubix cube
But figuring me out is something that you shouldn't do
Because my thoughts are locked inside a padded room
And if these padded walls could talk I'd surely be doomed
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Well, trouble's what they told me since the day I was born
Evil's what they stamped up on my hospital forms
I tried to choke my mom with my umbilical cord
The doctor was too busy amputating my horns
So the devil and the Lord both keep waging a war
Pulling me in opposite directions, I'm torn
A change of course, a deadly force, a terrible storm
Kicking down the devil's door to settle the score

[Pre-Chorus]
It's over, I'm older, I'm alive, I'm sober
Believe me, I'm living, I'm happy, I'm winning

[Chorus]
Faster, faster, I am on my way
Straight up, this disaster I can truly say
Saved us, and I know in my heart if you reach for the stars
All the things that you dreamed will indeed take you far
So just hope for the best, and just say "Fuck the rest"

[Verse 3]
Well, I should've been aborted when they had the chance
Cause now I'm stealing fame, I'm in the ears of the class
And all the high school kids are sick of being told to relax (fuck off)
The crazier the kid, the tighter his pants
Yeah, let's start a revolution bringing gothic back
Gotta march in like an army wearing black-on-black
I gotta thousand of these motherfucking copy cats
None of them can do it quite like I can

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I'm so tired of being sick, I'm so sick of being tired
This is for everyone out there who feels like they've had enough
This song is for you, and your mother too

[Bridge]
You'll never win, they said
So stop while you're ahead
And music is my love and passion's in my blood
So say what you will, cause I just don't give a fuck
So get the fuck up, go

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Charlie! Charlie!
What are you barking for?
Charlie bit my finger, ouch Charlie
