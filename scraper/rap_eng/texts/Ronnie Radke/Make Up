[Verse 1]
You caught my eye when I walked by
Judging from the way you move
Your heart is bruised
We sit and laugh
It's all an act
The lies, they seep through
You're such a fool

[Chorus]
As makeup runs down your cheeks
You found that you are lost again
Try to make your way back home
Found that you're alone

[Verse 2]
Put on your dress
And looks your best
Let this be your night
We'll laugh and die
So drink it down
We need this now
Make the pain go away
I can't be saved

[Chorus]

Fall down
Searching for the perfect place for you to lose it all again
Slow down, keep it at a steady pace as I watch you fade away

[Chorus] x2
