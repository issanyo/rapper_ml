[Verse 1]
My Destiny was large
From the day I picked up the mic it was written in the stars
The day that I was born my father knew and he held  me in his arms
Looked into my eyes
I sang my first melody, it came out as a cry
Thirty years have past and for the very first time I realized
I pour my life into every single line
I write until I die
And I've arrived In a place where I am fine
Cause 27 years ago I learned how to survive
Why my fucking mother left and dad was always high
The powers never on the bill was never on time
But I somehow learned to shine
Through the darkest nights I found the will to stay alive
Now every time you see me you gotta look up to the sky
The story of a boy who showed the world that he can fly, but I

[Hook]
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry dad I never meant to hurt you anyway
Watching me running from police up on the free way
I bet you never thought I'd end up on the news
Headline read: "accused murderer on the loose"
Dude, that's something I'd never do
The skewed view of the news leaving out the fucking truth
Of what actually happened God damn it, it was what I had to do
Defendin' friend's honor but I refuse to lose
So I choose abuse as a muse
Interrogation room but I refuse to spew any information too
I'm a mute and I will use my right to remain booed
I will never talk to red and blue to a jail cell I was due
I had to eat their fucking soup
Look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Praying for the day that they would let me out soon
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook]
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home

[Bridge]
Climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize if I fight
I've climbed so many mountains in my life
I've come to realize I will fight

[Verse 3]
This goes out to any kid that's listening and dwindling away from the world
Curled up in a ball and then distancing themselves
Because they feel like everyone's out to hurt them
I'm here to help with this burden
I am not perfect but I'm learning to be better
So if I can help a kid that's in a struggle that juggles
With his troubles to break out of his fucking bubble
Remove the fucking muzzle hustle out of the rubble
Put the pieces back to the puzzle even if it's subtle I'm humbled
I'm not as bad as you think I'm begging and pleading for you to believe me it stinks
That everyone around me thinks that I'm a fucking machine without a heart beat
But contrary to popular belief I've got a heart in this chest
And all I want is the best for everybody but it's hard when I obsess over stress
Anxiety stricken flashing visions of prison that I suppress
My hands start shaking over my quickness of breath
Cold sweat no regrets though it's time to fucking let go
Of all the pain I've harbored I am better I will revel
In the thought of leaving put my peddle to the metal
People I will let know sold my soul back from the devil
I will no longer eat your soup
Or look over my shoulder every time I eat my food
Cause today is the day you will let me go too
Cause these boots are made for walking and that's exactly what I'll do

[Hook]
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home
And it's nice to know that I've made it home
But it's safe to say that I'm all alone
So here I go, here I am, without you, without them
But it's nice to know that I've made it home
I made it home, I made it home
