[Chorus]
It’s 9 o’clock on the dot at the spot
And I’m hanging’ with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place
And you’re fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don’t wanna be that guy
That makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about
Making out with your friends (Go!)

[Verse 1]
I love the way that this began
Started off right, so innocent
I’m letting you know, I’m letting you go
I want your best friend
I’m giving’ it up and asking why
You seem so shocked and so surprised
I’m sorry it hurts, I’m surely a jerk
I understand why you’re mad

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don’t act like that
Everybody knows you’re right
Everybody knows I’m wrong (Wrong!)

[Chorus]
It’s 9 o’clock on the dot at the spot
And I’m hanging’ with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place
And you’re fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don’t wanna be that guy
That makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about
Making out with your friends (Go!)

[Verse 2]
It’s got nothing to do with how you look
Just another excuse to write a hook
I’m letting you know
She liked my post up on my Facebook
And after all you’re not my type
But all your friends are pretty nice
You know what I mean, stop making a scene
And take some words of advice

[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don’t act like that
Everybody knows you’re right
Everybody knows I’m wrong (Right!)

[Chorus]
It’s 9 o’clock on the dot at the spot
And I’m hanging’ with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place
And you’re fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don’t wanna be that guy
That makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about
Making out with your friends

[Bridge 1]
And I’ve got the topic conversation now
And I know I’m running out of time (Yeah!)
It’s on an honest demonstration now
You’re not the only one
Not the only one

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don’t talk that crap when you call me back
As a matter of fact, don’t act like that
Everybody knows you’re right
Everybody sing along

[Bridge 2]
And I don’t wanna be that guy
That makes you sad
Makes you cry, again
Without a doubt; sorry about
Fucking all your friends (What?)

[Chorus]
It’s 9 o’clock on the dot at the spot
And I’m hanging’ with her friends again
Great taste, beautiful place
And you’re fashionably late (Hey!)
And I don’t wanna be that guy
That makes you sad, makes you cry again
Without a doubt, sorry about
Making out with your friends

[Outro]
Making out with your friends
Making out with your friends

Without a doubt, sorry about
Having sex with all your friends
(Hahaha!)
