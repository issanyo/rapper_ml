(Days go by and I don't care at all
Days go by and I don't care at all)

I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me

From the gate I go realer but I'm not an ape
(Get it got it good)
Spit the truth from the hood, I'm a speak from the heart
That's what sets me apart from the rats and the snakes
Some people wanna rap about the money they make
(Wait they fake)
I rather get a ski mask and rob they bank
Nigga rob they pay, I rather work hard and rob they place
(And steal they fame)
I ain't giving out passes to rich as rappers
I'm giving out classes on how to make classics bastards
Niggas wanna know how I steal they flow
It's hypnotizing when I go
I'm hip when rhyming, spit my problems
Take what's yours and make it mine then OPP
Other peoples property, other peoples pussies watching me
Yeah
So when I come In clean and steal ya bitch
Everybody wants a problem with me
Obviously I brought my riders with me
Hey Ronnie, haters tryna disgrace
You gotta lighter, I gotta gas can

Let's light this place, put them in the dirt

(Days go by and I don't care at all)
(Days go by and I don't care at all)
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me

I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me

Ani, Meani, Miney, Moe
Which rappers wanna get it first
Got a 44, I'm a carnivore, come up in ya door
Move ya furniture, looking for cash and more
(Before I leave)
I'm a cum up in ya whore, leave her vocal cords sore
Leave her like I'm a leave my mi amor
She needs more
Not Winnie the Pooh, I'm Robin Christopher
Your Eeyore
Fuck robbing the hood, I'm robbing the rich to feed the poor
Robin Hood
(What's the vibe in the hood)
(Take a ride in the hood)
It's desperation and apathy
So I'm desperate with the back of me
I'm lifting my pears like let me get to that apple please
I'm ampted up
You wanna fuck with me? Please
These Gs Don't give an F
Enormous ransom notes before there's no antidote
I'm anti clone to these rappers with they panties on

Better take offense before I take ya gate home
I leave ya car with no tires on
I'm tired of it all, but most of all
I'm tired of being so tired of it all

(Days go by and I don't care at all)

(Days go by and I don't care at all)
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me

Days go, never had a halo
Do anything for the peso
Do what thous wilt that's the motto
With sounds from apollo
Ugh, Niggas better follow
How to rob the industry with only 50 cents
Get rich before I die
Hit the lick, cuz I'm sick of it
Sick of bitches with there dick turned clit
90s back, I'm an 80s baby, with the 90s rap, bring the 90s back
Don't deny the fact they defined the map
(Now you can lie to rap)
Competition best lock they interest
Cuz I'm picking the lock, Finna lift and rob
Lynch mob
This the new 2pac, all eyes on me
Oh the irony, cuz my eyes is the fire
No defining me

Might kill myself just to analyse me
Finalise me
Cuz I'm stuck in a world where they
Idolize weak emcees or to be conceived
Where the money grows slow and the weak don't eat
Damn this world is backwards

Live and lived is evil and devil forward
So why live backwards I'm living for it

(Days go by and I don't care at all)
(Days go by and I don't care at all)
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
Dirty money cash rules everything around me

I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me

Dirty money cash rules everything around me

I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me

Dirty money cash rules everything around me
(And I don't care at all)
I don't give a fuck if you niggas don't like me
