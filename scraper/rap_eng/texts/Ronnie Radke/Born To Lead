[Chorus]
Don't waste your time, it will never work
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me cause I was born to lead

[Verse 1]
I'm on your side, don't ever believe!
Or let anybody tell you
You cannot achieve your dreams
What are you fighting for?
Let down your guard, lift up your arms
Salute to the sky and be thankful you're here
The man in the mirror's the one that you fear the most
And just like a ghost
You'll escape your fate
You must not lose your hope

[Pre-Chorus]
To be the last one standing up
And when that day comes
They'll know what you're about

[Chorus]
Don't waste your time cause it will never work (it will never work)
Don't try and fight, it only makes it worse (only makes it worse)
And I will never be the one you can defeat
Believe in me cause I was born to lead

[Verse 2]
I've got your back, so fuck what they say
The hate that they show should enable your strength
Don't stray, stand up and fight, rise from the ashes
Open your eyes and fight
Fuck the ones that are holding you down
Open your eyes, you're wearing the crown
You are the reason they even exist
So put up your fist
The power is in you now

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The time has come to show them what you're made of
Go
Motherfucking move

[Chorus]
