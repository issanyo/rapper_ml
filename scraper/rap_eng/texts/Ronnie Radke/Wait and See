[Intro]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
This is what we've become

[Verse 1]
Calling all cars, it's an emergency, listen
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the end of existence
The television is fiction, it's telling lies to our vision
It's like a prison that we live in and we're all in the system
We live in a box and keep our family traditions
We keep our guns cocked, stocked up with more ammunition
We teach our children to kill instead of teaching them wisdom
And politicians waging wars, blaming it on religion

[Pre-Chorus]
We're dying
I'm feeling like I'm losing it again
The only person that we're losing is yourself, to this
I'm trying to be all that they want me to be
But it's hard to believe we are the enemy

[Chorus]
Will you wait and see
When the world stops spinning, and we're all pretending to be okay?
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
Humanity is trapped in a prison
Open up your eyes, see the vision
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be

[Verse 2]
Calling all people, we're in a state of confusion
Because we hate what we love and it's like a drug, we abuse it
And we're polluting solutions, we're all equal as humans
Truly united we stand, damn, let's connect through the music
All this hatred I'm seeing, but it's all an illusion
People using social media to hurt us, it's stupid
All these kids just feel the need to cut themselves on their wrist
The type of shit their parents miss because they're losing their grip

[Pre-Chorus]
We're dying
I'm feeling like I am losing it again
The only person that we're losing is yourself to this
I'm trying to be all that they want me to be
But it's hard to believe we are the enemy

[Chorus]
Will you wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
Humanity is trapped in a prison
Open up your eyes, see the vision
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be okay

[Bridge]
What in the hell have we done to ourselves?
Brick by brick we've built this cell
We are nothing left but a hollow shell
Hollow shell

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake

[Chorus 2]
Will you wait and see
When the world stops spinning and we're all pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
Humanity is trapped in a prison
Open up your eyes, see the vision
Wait and see
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be
When the world stops spinning, I won't stop pretending to be okay
But it's hard to be when you find out it's fake
