[Verse 1]
What if the devil was a lie?
What if God did not exist?
So, with all due respect
Tell me, what is death
If life is just a bitch?
I see the evil in their eyes
I hear the lies behind their grin
They wander in the dark
They do not have a heart
Don't let them take you in

(Brace for impact)

[Breakdown]
You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price
You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price

[Pre-Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high

[Chorus]
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard
Man overboard

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in ghosts?
Conducting from the grave?
We're nothing but pawns
So move to where they want
Cause life is just a game
I have my hands around your throat
With a smile upon my face
Squeeze until you choke
I will not let go until I feel okay

[Breakdown]
You will pay the price
For betraying me
You will pay the price
For betraying...

[Pre-Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high

[Chorus]
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard
Man overboard


[Bridge] x2
I bid farewell
To you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (You deserve)
And after all (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I've forgiven you for things you have done

I bid farewell
To you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (You deserve)
And after all (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I've forgiven you for things you have done

I bid farewell
To you, fairweather friend
I know someday you'll get what you deserve (You deserve)
And after all (And after all)
The bridges you have burned
I've forgiven you for things you have done

[Pre-Chorus]
So save yourself
Because the tide is rising high

[Outro]
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
So take some action
Don't let the undertow grab hold
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard (Man overboard)
Man overboard
It's sink or swim
It's hit or miss
What will you pick?
Man overboard
