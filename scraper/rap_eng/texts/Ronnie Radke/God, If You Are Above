[Verse 1]
God cannot save my soul
It's straight to hell for me I know
And when I get there
At least I found a place to call my home
They say the truth will set you free
Then why am I still here?
I've got no truth left, don't you see?
Am I making myself clear?

[Pre-Chorus]
Resolution no solution

[Chorus]
God, if you are above
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that you should?

[Verse 2]
The spirit's stuck between two roads and waiting there on me
The first path is the way to go, the life I want to lead
The second road's my crazy past
The darkest parts I try to mask
The drugs, the guns, the lies, the love
The dreams I had of waking up

[Pre-Chorus]
Resolution no solution

[Chorus]
God, if you are above
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that you should?

[Bridge]
Don't tell me I'm not worth the time
I will be fine
All these prayers have gone unanswered
Where were you?
(Where were you?!)

[Chorus]
God(god), if you are above
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that I should?
God(god), if you are above
I fear that one day the whole world will disappear
And if it does, will I have lived my life
The way that I could? The way that you should?
