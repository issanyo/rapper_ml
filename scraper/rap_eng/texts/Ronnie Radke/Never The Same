[Intro]
This is dedicated to all those critics
All you social sites
All you WiFi gangsters
Talk shit about this!
Fucking Bitch

[Verse 1]
I took a turn for the worse again, for stickin' my neck out for another friend
And this is what I get for being too nice, people wonder why I'm a fucking dick
What you would do if you had the world
Watching every move that you make up for
And everywhere that you went, you got a bitch tryna get you to admit it's stitching for attention, damn
That's the price of fame
I sold my soul into a ball of flame
That ball of flame is what keeps me lit, spill my heart in every bar and every line I spit
When that camera clicks and they're snapping pics, this is everything that I'm mentioning
This is the moment, I'll never let go of it, ready or not I'm about to take over it
Paparazzi, snappin' shots
Kamikaze, droppin' bombs
Family first, millionaire, debt reverse, heir to the chair
I reign supreme in every genre, stackin' that cheese, no lasagna
King of the jungle, Mufasa Mufasa
No worries for me, Hakuna-Matata!
Droppin' on the beat without a doubt or referee so need a piece up on a piece up on the mother fuckin' brink
You better think before ya blink cause I'm about to fuckin' swing hittin' everything I see in front of me, don't fuck with me
I'm killing every verse from the first word to the last verb, I'ma pass church like a bastard pastor
Last chapter, Mr. Mathers, wordest rapper, for the sake of crackers to get the last word

[Hook]
Never gonna be the same again
(Never gonna be the same)
(Never gonna be the same)
All I do is win, all I do is win
This is it, this is everything to me
Never gonna be the same again
(Never gonna be the same)
(Never gonna be the same)
All I do is win, all I do is win
This is it, this is everything to me

[Verse 2]
I'm chillin' on that sofa, hot like Arizona
The scene up in that coma, I'm a wake 'em up just like I'm folgers!
I'm a fucking soldier, never got my diploma
I'm up in them Cadillac's my teacher drive Toyota! HA
I don't give a fuck bro (I don't give a fuck bro)
And I don't call it luck though
I'm a fucking cut-throat
Bitch I got that recipe, mix it into a masterpiece
I'm rappin' in a rap-less scene
I stand on top of that balcony, and all I see surrounding me
Is tragedy, I spread my wings and vow to be the man to be
My chemistry, insymmetry, is made of gold like alchemy
I found things, so proud to be, is anyone gonna say they doubted me?!
Burn motherfucka burn
Watch how fast I can take this turn
In a car I never thought I'd have, man I can honestly say I've earned
And I've learned from the best, cursed to bless, stressin' less, most-certain yes
I'm better than I've ever been, no doubt about a champion, it's happenin' I'm stacking in and I'll never go back to that life

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Rock and roll, solid gold
Rocket shows, heart on froze
Colder than 50 below, freezing the road, like Eskimo homes when I flow
Exposition, exposé
Consecutive hits, but my name ain't José
Conseco motherfucking leggo my ego, and motherfucking bitches good at the deep throat
Bitch! Suck a dick
Lickety split
Fucking stick shift I'm a stick with
Bitch! Switchin' lanes, checkin' my engine
Liftin' rims off while I'm thriftin'
Suck on a dip-stick, been in a ditch, damn
It's just like a trailer and I'll never get hitched in
Spittin' like a drain up on the dip in the kitchen
Pussies won't shove from the friction I'm gettin'
Gimme a break, gimme a break, gimme a break of that kitty cat click clack plow
Fuckin hard, knowin' them I'll keep on raisin the bar, stuck in a park, peelin' herb from the dark, livin' in a sequel like return of Jaffar Killing competition like a Honda Accord
With the brakes cut goin' about 104, foot to the floor, strap to the door
Crash, glass, snatch-n-grab, your motherfuckin' ass shoulda grabbed the gat
Ambulance, clear the ditch, had to come and pull your ass up out of the dash
That's what you get for fucking with me
I told you motherfuckers I'll be running these streets
Do not confuse who I have to be, compared to everything that I've done and seen!

[Hook]
