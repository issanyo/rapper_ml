Where have you been?
My life's not the same without you in it

My love! I've watched you disappear
Right before my eyes
Right before I told you how i felt
No I must thank you now
For the things you've done
You helped me fight my demons
Like a mother to her son

Whoa where have you been
My life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
Your live and affection is all that I crave
I long for your kiss and your memory still remains

My heavy heart you carried on your back
And right before your eyes
I stood back up and picked up all the slack
My love I have done my best to
Hold my head up high ill never be the same
Without you in my life

Whoa where have you been
My life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
Your live and affection is all that I crave
I long for your kiss and your memory still remains

Blood in blood out!

Whoa where have you been
My life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
Your live and affection is all that I crave

Whoa where have you been
My life's not the same without you in it
Whoa forever I'll wait
Your live and affection is all that I crave

I long for your kiss and your memory still remains
I long for your kiss and your memory still remains
