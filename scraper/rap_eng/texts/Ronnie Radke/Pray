[Verse 1]
I was raised in a house with a dark cloud over it
I just wanted to get out and see the sun again
But no matter where I went, it followed me around
I guess it's just my luck forever

[Chorus]
So I pray for the day that the rain will come and wash away
All the pain that I face
It's getting way too hard to take
I'll run away, run away, run away
It's getting way too hard to take
I'll run away

[Verse 2]
It's always me versus myself, it is always in my mind
And the saddest part of all is knowing it won't die
I've gotten close with pain like a blade across my skin
The scars will still remain, forever

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My past seems to haunt me
My future is blurry
My addictions, they taunt me
No matter what happens, but I'm not sorry for the things I've done
It made me the person I am now
It made me the person I am now

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
But I'm not sorry
But I'm not sorry
