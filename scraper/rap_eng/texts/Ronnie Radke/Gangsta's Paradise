[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been laughing and blasting so long
That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone!
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talking and where you're walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight

[Chorus]
Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2]
Look at the situation, they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the streets
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things are going, I don't know!

[Breakdown]
So tell me why are we so fucking blind to see
The ones we hurt are you and me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck

Haha, fuck everyone!
