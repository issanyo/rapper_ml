I was lost, Now I'm found

I'm sustained by the sound
Of the angels singing me to sleep;
While my feet are leaving the ground
Am I dead or am I dreaming instead
A cornucopia of opiates are flooding my head

I'm insane, I am smart
All it takes is a spark to ignite my bad intentions
And do what I do best to your heart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full
So you know I won't play by the rules

I will never spill
Spill my blood for you
You have let me down
One too many times

Some way, somehow, we've fallen out
Caught in-between my enemies!
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me!
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

Due to mistakes that I have made to this day
I am trapped inside a Dillinger
Diligently thinking of ways to get out of this god awful place
I have learned that my fate is something I cannot escape so
Sound the alarms, we were dead from the start
It's a never ending system
Break me down, and tear me apart
Don't be fooled, I was raised by the wolves
Now the moon hangs in full
So you know I won't play by the rules

I will never spill
Spill my blood for you
You let me down
One too many times

Some way, somehow we've fallen out
Caught in-between my enemies!
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me!
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

This is the end of you;
This is where I draw the line
And I won't lose
This war is mine

Spill my blood for you
One too many times

Some way, somehow we're fallen out
Caught in-between my enemies
No way, not now, I won't back down
I draw the line at you and me
You're what I started, now disregarded
One day they'll see, it was always me

One day they'll see, it was always me
It was always me
