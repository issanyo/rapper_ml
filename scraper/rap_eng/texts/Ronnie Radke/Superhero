[Verse 1]
A drop in the ocean, a crack in the sky
It's setting the notion, we're all gonna die
And you're always running with nowhere to go
You're living for nothing, but dying to know
But we're all terrified

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a superhero 'cause I can't save the world
So I'm never gonna get the girl, I just wanna do better
Superhero, 'cause I can't save myself
Much less somebody else, so I gotta do better

[Verse 2]
You're caught in a cycle, you'll never get out
Afraid of your shadow and living in doubt
But this isn't over, it's only begun
And there is no honor in giving it all up

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a superhero 'cause I can't save the world
So I'm never gonna get the girl, I just wanna do better
Superhero, 'cause I canâ€™t save myself
Much less somebody else, so I gotta do better
So I gotta do better

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a superhero 'cause I can't save the world
So I'm never gonna get the girl, I just wanna do better
Superhero 'cause I can't save myself
Much less somebody else, so I gotta do better

[Outro]
Superhero, so I gotta do better
Superhero
