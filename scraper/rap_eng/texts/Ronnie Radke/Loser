[Verse 1]
Run, my dear, as fast as you can
You killed me here, the blood's on your hands
Oh, I don't really think that you will ever understand
The person that I was, the person that I am
I'm different now, you're distant how, will we ever work this out?

[Chorus]
You're always getting me high then you're pulling me low
Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"
If you want me to guess, I'm just a stranger you know
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just a loser
Yeah, yeah, guess I am a loser
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?

[Verse 2]
Run, my love, I'm back from the dead
Let it go, it's all in your head
Oh, I could not believe that you will never let it be
And nobody knows all the trouble you've seen
I get it, sweetheart, we're always "low, low, low"
You're always pushing me away, but then you're pulling me close
So let's make a toast to all the years we've wasted
Hold your glasses high for all the tears we've tasted
I'm different now, you're distant how, will we ever work this out?

[Chorus]
You're always getting me high then you're pulling me low
Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"
If you want me to guess, I'm just a stranger you know
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just a loser
Yeah, yeah, guess I am a loser
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, look what you've become
Yeah, yeah, all the damage done
Yeah, yeah, I guess I've won
Yeah, yeah, look what you've become
Yeah, yeah, all the damage done
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking loser
Yeah, yeah, look what you've become
Yeah, yeah, all the damage done
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You're always getting me high then you're pulling me low
Then you beg me to stay, but you want me to go
You're always telling me "yes", but your answer is "no"
If you want me to guess, I'm just a stranger you know
If you call this winning, why do I feel like a loser?
