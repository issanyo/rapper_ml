[Intro]
My biggest fear is coming true
Mother, I'm becoming you
One day the truth is gonna hang me like a noose
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Verse 1]
Mama, you are an addict, and you passed it down to me
But who am I to cast a stone with a daughter I never see?
And, honestly, this honesty is getting way too hard to sing
I'd trade it all, I would give it back to be a decent human being

[Chorus]
I don't mind, what's the use?
It doesn't matter if I win or lose
If I don't belong here, then neither do you
It doesn't matter if I make it through, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
So drag me through the mud again and crucify my name
Laugh at me right through your screen, how I should be ashamed
Take out all your pain on me like I'm the one to blame

[Chorus]
I don't mind, what's the use?
It doesn't matter if I win or lose
If I don't belong here, then neither do you
It doesn't matter if I make it through, I don't mind

[Bridge]
You don't belong here, but I don't mind
You don't belong here, but I don't mind
You don't belong here, but I don't mind
You don't belong here, but I don't mind

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't mind, what's the use?
It doesn't matter if I win or lose
If I don't belong here, then neither do you
It doesn't matter if I make it through, I don't mind

[Outro]
My biggest fear is coming true
Mother, I've become you
