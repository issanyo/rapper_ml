I'm back
[Laughter]

So let's rewind back to the time
2005, I almost died
I overdosed, I did not know
Did I provoke this evil ghost?
Disaster!

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
Over catchy beats
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene

Lalalalala!
(Lalalalala!)[3x]
Lalalalala!!

I dug a hole
10 miles wide
So I could throw all of you inside
You're such a dumb fuck
You need to shut up
You bring a picture of me every time you get your haircut
Impostor!

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
Over catchy beats
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene

Lalalalala![4x]
Lalalalala!
(Lalalalala!)[3x]
Lalalalala!!

Oh
Bruised and broken
My eyes are open
I won't lose focus
My eyes are open
Can you see in the distance
Can you see the resistance
We will rise, rise against them
From the start, rise against them

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
Over catchy beats
(Lalalalala)
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
(Lalalalala)
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene
(Lalalalala)

Magically
I turned tragedy
Into melodies
Over catchy beats
(Lalalalala)
It comes so naturally
So smooth and casually
(Lalalalala)
That's why they call me king
Of the music scene
(Lalalalala)
