If I was granted one wish it would be for you to see me
For who I really am because these looks can be deceiving
And, I swear to God, if you listen closely
By the time this song is over you will truly know me
Because I am not a monster, I am just a man
And im getting sick and fucking tired of these fans
They expect me to be a perfect version of a fucking person
And its hurtful, I feel worthless I just wanna feel im worth it
And its hard but I am learning to be honest
And discerning and i am gaining all my courage to be better
I am searching (Damn) but its so damn hard to keep calm
When everything I know is broken and scarred!
Im not trying to complain about my problems at all
Because my problems are the reason i have gotten this far
So I am thankful for adversity for making me strong
Im just trying to explain how I feel in a song
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

Lets take it back to'92 when I was 8
My brother gave me a tape by mistake: Dr. Dre
It was December 15th to the date (Lemme ride)
The Chronic on my birthday must have been fate!
Now lets flash forward to the first time in'99
When i heard Shady on the radio and, to my surprise
That this is really happening a white boy is rapping
From the bottom to the top that motherfucker made it happen
So i grab my pen and pad and start writing down the madness
Later joined a band and wrote my songs around my sadness
Formulated all my Tragic moments into Magic
Now im selling tickets to my show and have them packed in
You best believe it because im telling the truth
I bought a motherfucking Caddy and a house with a view
Dont need to prove im amazing and im keeping it true
So before you try to hate me take a walk in my shoes
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

And after all iv'e been through I can say i made it
Through the fucking bullshit to the other side safely
I can truly say i can feel myself changing into a better person
Dont give a fuck if you can hate me
Never gonna let you fucking take me down
The path im used to taking
And i know in my heart of hearts the problems that im facing
Is in half the battle im fighting, energy i am wasting
Im so sick of these fucking bitches changing what im saying
Into something that its not, man this shit has to stop
Shit, ill wear the clothes I want and cut my hair all off
And ill do it just to prove that im a motherfucking boss
And my music keeps me moving, I will not slow or pause
Id like to think that im A-Okay
And my worries are all foolish and will fade away
One day id like to think i faced my fate
And my legacy lives on you'll remember my name
It goes...

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound

Oh!
I really can't believe im here right now
Im hanging on an airplane
Falling through the airwaves
In the clouds
Oh!
I never ever want to touch the ground
Im walking on a tightrope
Searching for the right note
To play that sound
