There is a price that we all must pay
I'm not sorry for the mistake I have made
So can you tell me what will you do
When everything you know turns right around on you

I've been through a hell of a lot
You let them nail me to your cross
No matter who, what, where or when
I've always went down for all your sins

My daddy told me not to bite my tongue
I hate my momma cause she left me with no love
I bottled it up, I sweep it under the rug (hate my mother)
If all the good things got to come to an end
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins
I’m obviously pessimistic cynical a hypocritic mess

Yeah!

Self-destruct personality
Won't discuss my responsibility
I am always walking on the final verge
I'm killing myself but I am not a murderer

If all the good things got to come to an end
Then we're living in a world where the evil wins
I’m obviously pessimistic cynical a hypocritic mess

Never gonna be the only thing that matters in my life when everything around me has failed
Who knows what the future brings but eventually the truth will prevail
It's moments like these where you really got to think about the broken dreams that you sell
Tick tock in your head it goes where it stops who knows, like a carousel
