[Verse 1]
You will never be alright
And I will never be okay
And I can't be your Jesus Christ
'Cause I am but a mortal man, just looking for the promised land

[Pre-Chorus]
And it kills me slowly
You never know what you got till it's gone forever
My one and only
It's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
When life gets hard, I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
And if you could cast a spell. would it be to watch me fail? Well, I prevail
I prevail

[Verse 2]
You will never see the light
Heaven will not know your name
And my only real advice is
The only thing that you ignore is exactly what you're looking for

[Pre-Chorus]
So listen closely
You never know what you got till it's gone forever
My one and only
It's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
When life gets hard I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
And if you could cast a spell, would it be to watch me fail?

[Chorus]
Oh, when life gets hard I send a prayer
For this cross I have to bear and this smile I'm forced to wear
And I'm no good, no good, can't you tell?
Oh, if I could cast a spell, I would send you straight to hell
And if you could cast a spell, would it be to watch me fail?
