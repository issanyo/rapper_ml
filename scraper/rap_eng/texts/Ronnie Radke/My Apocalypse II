[Verse 1]
I've walked a road of misery
That's where I've found my comfort
So I pick and chose my company
But one is a lonely number

And I wanna believe that the grass is green
There's only one way to find out

I'm reaching for the unachievable
From this day on, I am all I've got

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All I want is to be adored
By someone who wants nothing more
When I was young, disowned and pushed away
And that's why I wanted all this fame
(Wanted all this fame)
And you're to blame

[Outro]
Over and over and over again, and again
I'm slipping through the cracks
I've seen the light, the afterlife
Of reliving my past
And when will it ever stop?
It's very clear, my biggest fear is falling from the top
Falling from the top
Falling from the
