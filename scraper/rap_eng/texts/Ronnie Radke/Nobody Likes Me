[Chorus: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, but I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, why? 'Cause I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh

[Verse 1: Deuce]
All this hate that you gave me, it turned me to rage
Now I'm burning in flames, all the things that you said
They've been stuck in my head, now I'm at it again, an addict
Welcome to hell, bitch, you can't do nothing about it
Out of my way, faggot, you heard what I said, damn it
I am an automatic, ready to fire back at
All of you fuckers laughing, not gonna lie, I've had it
I'm gonna wreak havoc, everyone's dying, don't matter

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & The Truth]
This is my chance, maybe my last
And if I leave, there's no way back
This is your fate when worlds collapse
I took my pain, now I'll give it back
I give it back, give it back, only one of us will laugh last
Now I'll give it back
I give it back, give it back, break this whole fucking world in half

[Chorus: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, but I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, why? 'Cause I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh

[Verse 2: Ronnie Radke]
I used to have so many friends I thought I could trust
But when it came to saving me, you let me self-destruct
Well, I'm back now, I'm seeking out this vengeance
Not to mention that this black cloud, it sticks around and visits my intuition
Won't let me back down and I swear to God my heart is like a piston
Pumping rage into this engine, turn the keys to my ignition, listen
Nobody likes me, it's enlightening, it excites me
That I talk this shit with the lyrics I spit and still nobody will fight me
Try walking a mile in my shoes and get beat with your own Nikes
I'm a grimy motherfucker with the mic, so call me Mikey
I got no patience lately, from these fucking faggots faking
Making lies up, wise up if you really think you can take me
Wake me up from this lazy babble, rattle you with my crazy battle
Paid my dues back on the saddle, the lonely road that I slowly travel

[Pre-Chorus: Deuce & The Truth]
This is my chance, maybe my last
And if I leave, there's no way back
This is your fate when worlds collapse
I took my pain, now I'll give it back
I give it back, give it back, only one of us will laugh last
Now I'll give it back
I give it back, give it back, break this whole fucking world in half
Break this world in half!

[Chorus: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, but I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, why? 'Cause I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh

[Bridge: Deuce]
You thought you figured it out
You thought you figured it out
You thought you figured it out
You thought you figured me out
You never figured me out
You can't figure me out
Shut the fuck up, I'll burn you fuckers down
I know you're proud, I held my ground, time's running out
You hear the crowd, they know you're down, time's running out

[Chorus: Deuce]
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, but I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh
Nobody likes me, no one likes me, why? 'Cause I don't like them
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh

[Outro: Deuce]
Now it's much too late to say you're sorry
Don't care what you think
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-ah
Now it's much too late to say you're sorry
Don't care what you think
Uh-uh, I don't, nah-ah
