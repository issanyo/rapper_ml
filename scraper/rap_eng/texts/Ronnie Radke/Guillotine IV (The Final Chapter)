My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell and it swallows me in
The demons are all in my head
Pulling me in, pulling me in

Here I go
Sinking below, sinking below
All I know
Fading away, fading away from me now

[Pre-Chorus]
This can't be happening
I've watched my whole world fall apart

[Chorus]
So long, farewell to the best of me (It's so far away)
And I'm my own worst enemy (And it's so hard to say)
There's no way out (You are way too late)
Say goodbye to the rest of me (The rest of me)

Bound
By the Demons, they doubt me
My whole world is around me, is drowning
And the demons I hate
Are the monsters
I always create

My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell and it swallows me in
The demons are all in my head
And they're pulling me in, pulling me in

[Pre-Chorus]
This can't be happening
I've watched my whole world fall apart

[Chorus]
So long, farewell to the best of me (It's so far away)
And I'm my own worst enemy (And it's so hard to say)
There's no way out (And you are way too late)
Say goodbye to the rest of me (The rest of me)

[Chorus]
So long, farewell to the best of me (It's so far away)
And I'm my own worst enemy (And it's so hard to say)
There's no way out (And you are way too late)
Say goodbye to the rest of me (Say goodbye to the rest..)

So long, farewell to the best of me (It's so far away)
And I'm my own worst enemy (And it's so hard to say)
There's no way out (And you are way too late)
Say goodbye to the rest of me (The rest of me)
