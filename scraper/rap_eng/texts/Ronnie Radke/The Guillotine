[Verse 1]
So lock and load mercenaries
I see the smoke from the hilltop
They march one by one

The battled starts adversaries
We bathe in our blood
The worst is yet to come
We've reached the covenant
To kill what we have started
Kill the machines
We've spawned to fight in the darkest hour

[Pre-Chorus]
They really need to know
We really gotta go
(We fight to live, we fight for pride)
They really need to know
(We won't back down the weak won't survive)
We really gotta go

[Chorus]
We stay here tonight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
Promise me you won't leave my side
(The warmest place to lie my head)
And when the sun comes up we fight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
So promise me you won't leave my side

[Verse 2]
Trace the blood back to the grave
The smoke has cleared
Thousands are destroyed
They send signals no salvation
We fight in lock out
Scope is ready to go
Armed with explosives
Spartans stand alone

[Pre-Chorus]
They really need to know
We really gotta go
(We fight to live, we fight for pride)
They really need to know
(We won't back down the weak won't survive)
We really gotta go

[Chorus]
We stay here tonight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
Promise me you won't leave my side
(The warmest place to lie my head)
And when the sun comes up we fight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
So promise me you won't leave my side

With my breath!

[Chorus]
We stay here tonight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
Promise me you won't leave my side
(The warmest place to lie my head)
And when the sun comes up we fight
(Don't let them find us or we're dead)
So promise me you won't leave my side

[Verse 3]
Charge the gates with rust on their gears
They seek destruction and kill the functions
Charge the gates with rust on their gears
They seek destruction and kill the functions
Charge the gates with rust on their gears
They seek destruction and kill the functions
Charge the gates with rust on their gears
