He had a plan to kill you all along
The evidence was hidden in this song
I was a ghost, I was there at the scene
As the embers rise, my hands
Smelled like gasoline

So, the head lights murdered my thoughts
I curse this taste that's on my tongue
This taste will last until I rip it out
No, I won't need these gloves
Her bones are withered away
But her ghost will remain

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only one that wore your seatbelt
We're the only ones that cried
Catastrophic accidents
You're the only one that died

[Chorus]
So keep my casket closed
Your heart beats under the floor
It haunts me in my dreams
And nothing's as it seems

Hallelujah

So just believe in me
I'll never let you down
This was a curse I can say
As you lie in your grave

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

(But her ghost will remain as you lie in your grave)
(But her ghost will remain as you lie in your grave)

All the choices you've made
And the paths that I take
You're the only one that died
The evidence was hidden in this song

All the choices you've made
And the paths that I take
We're the only ones that cried
Irrelevant
I knew it all along

All the choices you've made
And the paths that I take
(It was never enough, it was never enough
It was never enough now was it)

[Chorus x3]
