[Intro]
Oh my god, I have the remedy for love
I struck the glass and broke the bones inside my fist, but I'm ok

[Refrain]
I cannot change you (I cannot change you)
You'll never change (you'll never change)
I never would expect to break this in the end

[Verse 1]
Something so profound, something you won't expect
Take this scripture like a picture and wear it around your neck
The sky it opens up
Don't get swallowed by the flames
What's mine is yours and yours is mine so take me away

[Chorus]
You hear the sounds, they're carried out
There's no sympathy for the dead
It swells and I, was never the same
There's no sympathy for the dead
We dance like zombies do in the middle of the rain
We see the stones falling from the sky (on fire)
The blinding light beaming from your eyes (our desire)
Life has died, yet we're still alive and down below
A sea of damned crashing like a tidal wave, wave

[Refrain]
I cannot change you
You'll never change (you'll never change)
I never would expect to break this in the end

[Verse 2]
I can't breathe
Wake up from this nightmare that I'm in
Dive into a holy river and wash away my sins
As I reach (sanctified) the surface of the water now
I will breathe and burn out my eyes

[Chorus]
You hear the sounds, they're carried out
There's no sympathy for the dead
It swells and I, was never the same
There's no sympathy for the dead
We dance like zombies do in the middle of the rain
We see the stones falling from the sky (on fire)
The blinding light beaming from your eyes (our desire)
Life has died, yet we're still alive and down below
A sea of damned crashing like a tidal wave, wave

[Bridge]
So take the medicines to quench the pain we have
And walk until the end, until you've reached the sand
A hundred thousand wings, soaring through the sky
At intense speeds, we can't catch with our eyes
You hear the sounds of a third carried out
Just wait (just wait)
You hesitate

[Verse 3]
I have the remedy to the poisonous kiss
I struck the glass, it shatters bones in my fist (you hesitate)
I have the remedy to the poisonous kiss
I struck the glass, it shatters bones in my fist (you hesitate)
I have the remedy to the poisonous kiss (There's no sympathy for the dead)
I struck the glass, it shatters bones in my fist (you hesitate)
I have the remedy to the poisonous kiss (There's no sympathy for the dead)
I struck the glass, it shatters bones in my fist
You hesitate

[Outro]
There's no sympathy for the dead
(You hesitate)
There's no sympathy for the dead
(You hesitate)
There's no sympathy for the dead
(You hesitate)
