[Chorus: samples]
“Pistol packin’, monkey drinkin’, no money bum!”
“The bum from the park… Get a job you bum!”
“Homeless people livin’ in the train stations”
“Jealous, lazy bum”

[Verse 1: Mr. Hyde]
I’m just a piece of shit bum stinkin’ wretched and foul
When I stumble by you’ll have to hold your breath for a while
I can hear my stomach growl but I got no loot man
So I’m taxin’ oranges from your neighborhood fruit stand
Fishin’ in the creek thought I saw some movement there
But if it ain’t no fish maybe I’ll catch a boot to wear
Eat a 3 course meal that I found in debris
And now I’m off to the park cause water fountains are free
Got the clap, TB whooping cough and gonorrhea
Think of puke piss and beer but mostly diarrhea
See I sleep on a bench covered in a plastic bag
My feet fuckin’ stench can’t recall my last bath
Lookin’ strange on the train beggin’ you for your change
Kind of like a sick animal with rabies and mange
Out my left pant leg urine leak to the floor
I got fleas like a dog and fuckin’ reek like a morgue
While you worried about your mansion I’m concerned with the street
And if I had a dollar kid I’d probably burn it for heat
See I’m frozen alone and sneakerless with toe jam
Age is 25 but I look like an old man
I’ll tell you I’m starvin’ and need money for food
But every penny I use is gettin’ spent on my booze
Haven’t showered in months I stink like rotted vegetables
But still hop on the train kid and sit right next to you

[Chorus: samples]
“Pistol packin’, monkey drinkin’, no money bum!”
“The bum from the park… Get a job you bum!”
“Homeless people livin’ in the train stations”
“Jealous, lazy bum”
“Pistol packin’, monkey drinkin’, no money bum!”
“The bum from the park… Get a job you bum!”
“Homeless people livin’ in the train stations”
“Jealous, lazy bum”

[Verse 2: Necro]
Bums smell like rancid shit lookin’ like Jesus and Manson mixed
Rockin’ diseases hepatitis a leper with a virus
Reppin’ the sidewalks, hes full of pride when he talks
Thousands have died in the parks from Parkinsons
And hypothermia like victims in Germany
In the infirmary lazy permanently
Lookin’ like a deranged fuck walkin the streets with a change cup
Full of zombies dying for a salami a slice of pastrami
Spend a night in a lobby fiendin’ for a blanket
I seen a bum rockin’ my 8 year old Fila jacket
He’ll probably shank someone for you a dollar for hire
Cuz he’ll do anything for a frankfurter from papaya
Refuse to work a leech on permanent vacation
In Hibernation asleep under the boardwalk at the beach
In junkyards collecting bottles in shopping carts
Human roaches infested shelters stinkin’ like rottin’ farts
Carpenter bums stay hands on
Building homes made of cardboard boxes that cats breakdance on
Vietnam vets with no legs that can’t afford eggs
Begs dressed in rags rockin’ a shit bag full of dregs

[Chorus: samples]
“Pistol packin’, monkey drinkin’, no money bum!”
“The bum from the park… Get a job you bum!”
“Homeless people livin’ in the train stations”
“Jealous, lazy bum”
“Pistol packin’, monkey drinkin’, no money bum!”
“The bum from the park… Get a job you bum!”
“Homeless people livin’ in the train stations”
“Jealous, lazy bum”

[Verse 3: Uncle Howie]
Listen mother fucker get this strait
Your momma got a pussy like a B-58
Runs by electric runs by gas
Your momma got a pussy like King Kong’s ass
Hey little girl does your mother know you’re out?
With your pants off and your pussy stickin’ out
Somebody whore poor kid
Did you get a hard on not yet
Are you gonna get one you bet
Oh, ho, ho, ho
Bum, bum, a bum, bum, bum, bum
Ho, ho, ho, ho
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
Cut it, cut it, cut it

[Outro: sample]
“Homeless… She’s homeless”
