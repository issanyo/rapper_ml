{Verse 1]
These murderous displays cause more commotion than road rage
Stabbing you with an afro comb and leave holes in your skull plate
When I'm kissing the sky, high off the rhyme amphetamine
You're trying to find out what I mean when speaking hypothetically
You're pathetic as fat hookers in a shit house
I'm sicker than Pat Butcher with her saggy tits out licking on some dick now
Lyrical two timer, shiv you with a screw driver
Big up to the youths grinding, blitzing frmo the blue sirens

I'm squeezing the juice from my brain to initiate
The hidden waves of radiation that's giving you skin decay
'Cus when I'm in the place, the punchlines will break your nose
And force a water hose down your throat until your brain explodes
Or do they have to be a fool to be in your position?
Threw you into submission, brutalizing organisms
Ganja burning like walking on camp fire
Giving rap black eye just for talking 'bout mangina

Save MC's like Japanese Akitas and ridgebacks
Bringing darkness into the rap scene 'til it's pitch black
Heads are blacker than a dumb bitch with fake hair
Talking 'bout you can't get in her drawers when everyday she wears the same pair

[Hook] x2
While I'm inflicting ya with spina bliffida, the high curricular
These rhyming snitches are liars like Christopher Columbus
Rhyming like a bunch of fucking imbeciles
Pussy juices and Vagisil, puss, blood, and Clearisil

{Bridge] x4
Burning flesh, hell yeah, Death Iz In 'D' Air...

[Verse 2]
I'll hang you over a cliff and burn the rope 'til it rips
Stone you with boulders and bricks on your dome 'til it splits
Souls of the mist, fit to drain you of bodily fluids
The fuckery gruesome leaving you with your stomach protruding
Crumbs and grains, I'm gonna bust your brains with rusty chains
What a fucking shame, I had to beat you to another shade
I'm like a cooker that's leaking carbon monoxide
And filling up your inside with sodium peroxide

Pass the machete and put it in your mouth like Akinyele
Stepping to me lyrically the situation's far from petty
Exaggerate and laminate you to a wind shield
Of a speeding car, the flying glass left your wig peeled
When I stare in the mirror, I appear to be thinner
The endless hunger in the mind of a serial killer
Watching the sun set and resurrect the undead
Murder murder death kill, redrum, run red

Faces of death, playing little games of Russian Roulette
A race in your mind when I drop steel weights on your head
I'm similar to Sleepy Hollow, you won't see tomorrow
Drowning your sorrow, legendary like the Mask Of Zorro
The illest yet, the creator of a simple test
Drink a tank of unleaded petrol and light a cigarette
Get it together like a family reunion
I terrorize your life span, a motherfucking hooligan

[Hook] x2
While I'm inflicting ya with spina bliffida, the high curricular
These rhyming snitches are liars like Christopher Columbus
Rhyming like a bunch of fucking imbeciles
Pussy juices and Vagisil, puss, blood, and Clearisil

{Bridge] x8
Burning flesh, hell yeah, Death Iz In 'D' Air...
