[Verse 1: Necro]
Exploitation, grind house, hip-hop, illness
Expiration of ya life, the realness
You get chopped into bits, intricately split you, hit you like Jet Li
Deadly, unfriendly medley, wet you up in ya Bentley
Sanguinary, biochemistry, chemotherapy, chemical treatment
Criminal cemetery symmetry
Intimidating
Stick a blade in, grip the .38 and spit at you, blood precipitating
It's King Crimson
Bring it like Simpson, bling pimpin, like Sing Sing pen, fly like a wing man
My gridiron gang chokes you like the hangman, 21st Century Schizoid Man
A killer with tuberculosis, knocking on ya door, built like Hercules holding a circular saw
Leave you extremely appalled, make you scream and crawl
Prolific, horrific like the Grand Guignol

[Verse 2: Mr. Hyde]
Acid rain dancing, my victims take a tantrum
Attack like Gunnar Hansen, when wearing blood I'm handsome
Capturing for ransom, send the cash advance in
I'm commanding an army of phantoms with lanterns
Let the poison ants in, your bloody body seizure
Jack the Ripper slashes when cutting up a skeezer
Buck you for my leisure, you're ducks in hunting season
No cure for the gore, AIDS, indonesian lesions
Freak the crematory, gory, flow to speak the story
I'm like Pesci with the .44, twist your wig like Morrie
Say you never saw me or you'll be another muthafucka
Sinking to the bottom of a river like a truck or something
Tuck a couple blades under my buckle, hack and tackle
Keep the skulls under my fucking shack in tabernacles
We Lace you with the taste of razorblade abrasion cuts
You face the desecration slut, there's no escaping us
