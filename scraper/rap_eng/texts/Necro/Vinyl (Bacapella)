I started thumping in the early 20's, they used to pump me
For family affairs, bebop clubs to drug junkies
I was nameless, the more I spun the more I became famous
As more time past you can find me on a playlist
I'm worldwide knowledge, well rounded and black
World War One, I got beef with a click called the 8-track
I spun and spun, till the war was won
Damn, another threat, some crew called cassets
It was a long, hard struggle but I managed to bust through
We called it a draw because we both showed some muscle
Now I'm just chilling, lounging, making millions
I'm playing in parks, on tables, in front of buildings
Them days was the loudest, cause we were survivors
Till I started getting run-down by some deadly virus
Now it's World War Three, cassets and me
Up against some disease they call CDs
The cassets sold out, joined CDs against me
They trapped me in my sleeve, where hardly no air to breathe
Is this the end of me? Damn, who will be a friend of me?
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, help me kill the enemy!
DJs, they never gave up, they kept faith
Especially Eclipse, he's got thousand of my soulmates
As far as I can see, I'ma never rest in piece
Thanks to modern pop stores, DJs in the streets, peace

Sir? We have another threat
MP3s. And the internet
