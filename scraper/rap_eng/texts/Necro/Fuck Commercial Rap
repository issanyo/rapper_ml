(What you going to do?)
*scratches*
(What you going to do?)

(Verse 1)
I don't give a fuck if you're a big time rapper, ice'd up
I don't like your face it'ill look better sliced up
You're a cock suck and disgrace to rap kid
Baking a mockery of what G Rap did
Rakim, Krs One and Kane
The big four, wanna learn how to rap, study the game
Commercial, used to be controversial
Now it's all about dress rehershal
And I don't get the best verse, in who's ill
Coming up in the nineties in the streets, could've got killed
Now it's internet gangsters and cowards
Keyboard warriors and tec companies with power
I'm not sour, I'm down with technology
Pimp any way that you can, is my psychology
Salute MC's with a career of fiteen years
I'm all way out here, new jacks be aware
Lonegevity, let's see if you can last as long as me
I'll give up at the first catastrophy
Every ones a dog when they're rolling deep
Are you a thug all along, without your peeps?
I doubt it

(Chorus)
You don't beef you want peace
You don't want your teeth knocked out in the street
I pull a Glock out and pop your face
FUCK COMMERCIAL RAP!
(What you going to do)
You don't beef you want peace
You don't want your teeth knocked out in the street
I pull out the biscuit and get sadistic
FUCK COMMERCIAL RAP!


(Verse 2)
Made connections
Don't mean that you can rap good, you gotta win a fan's affection
You let a man's errection inserting your ass
New rappers are shitty versions of the past
Get a surgeon to cut at your unoriginality
You're splurging at the bar, instead of buying reality
Real T, your funs will diminish
I'm real G, you better save up or you're finished
I live what I rap
So when I say I put a shiv in your neck
You know it's a fact I get respect
Dipped in fashion
Catch brains, while T-Pain's inover the strip was blasting
Every track has a purpose eventually
Fuck a bitch to death, rap choke her sexually

(Chorus)
You don't beef you want peace
You don't want your teeth knocked out in the street
I pull out the Glock and pop your face
FUCK COMMERCIAL RAP!
(What you going to do)
You don't beef you want peace
You don't want your teeth knocked out in the street
I pull out the biscuit and get sadistic
FUCK COMMERCIAL RAP!
