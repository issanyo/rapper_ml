[Hook:]
Somebody's waiting for you somewhere down the road
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving
Keep on driving

[Verse 1:]
In the pick up truck, sick bikers, escapees from Rikers, snickerin'
Hicks with pitch forks, picking up Hitch-hikers and tricking 'em We likes it Killing live chickens with an ice pick
Run quickly, you're in a snuff flick G
Feed you to a pig, your wig eaten up, no need to dig
Jigged up bleeding from you ribs like squibs
I'll eat the brains of your kid's kids!
Male chauvinist with a fro shall attack
And sting you like a big cobra, slapped
You get trapped in my crib, in your grill
Like a jib camera, vicking you like a vig
Shoot you up, you pukin' up uranium
Blastin' your mom dukes in the cranium
The insane asylum, sanitarium, off the crazy train of delirium, in the vein again (AAAHH!!)
You're being chased through the forest by crazy faced coroners
With an amazing taste for blood like tyrannosauraus
You're exhausted, cut off your clitoris
Divorce it from your orifice, force in a fist
Torture with forceps
Nauseous from horseshit, a coffin wraps your torso like a corset
Juxed multiple times, like shrapnel inside a war vet
A crooked cult crime
The sultan of slime with the insulting rhyme
Get cooked from a jolt of voltage in your spine
Indulging the coldness, bitterness, cruelness, ruthless, vulgarness
Ogrish, ghoulish, when the full moon hits
The ultimate focus is who won't live!

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
You ran out of gas, on a farm road, and trespassed
Now you're stabbed in your ass, with broken bottles
Choking on crushed light bulbs, fill up your abdomen with glass, and bust rifles
I'm pullin' out your organs, organizing, an orchestration of gore appreciation
Depravation, give a whore a fecies facial
Eat it raw, defication, suffocation
You get smothered in anal, kill you like the brother of Abel
I'll make your mother my table, then shove electrical cable in her intestinal navel
You just don't get it, you're found dead naked, beheaded
Your drowned head decapitated
And used for bait below the sea bed imbedded
A school of red snappers ate it then jetted
Your corpse is a grizzly work of art
Like a grizzly bear with a body part in his mouth eating like Sizzler
Scissor teeth sharp like shattered mirrors
Into your heart by the wizard of incisions
Dead, but your nerves make you pop up like jack in a box
Attack with an axe like a fox
Screaming like you're typing with caps Lock on
Frightened so bad your hair whitened
Shoved on a meat hook
By a creep that looks like Meat Loaf
A big oaf, a mofo with a mullet keeping your skull as a trophy
Skin on the sofa covered in fungus growth
Dumping you in a crawl space
I'm an off the wall nutcase
Rocking your face on my face, while pumping Ace of Base
Piece by piece, disgrace your faith

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
They're watching you's, talkin' with walkie talkies
Hawking you with binoculars
They're cop killers creeping like tarantulas
The praying mantis and chinchillas
You go from being innocent and fearless
To careless to brutally pillaged
Like Todd Bridges transition from being Willis
To shacked up in a crack house with dealers
Cracking your back with a Black Jack 'til you Snap you spine, fractured
Like a flashback reaction from mescaline cactus, making your back twitch
You're ass backwards
Warriors, the serial killer version
Put a blade to your dome when I invade your trailer home like a military incursion
And make you Drink your urine
In a deserted desert, unpleasantly murdered
Your vertebrae is some perverted peasant's dessert
Your gizzard is a skuzzy treasuring present
For some pheasant and buzzard
The mutants molest at night on a nuclear testing site
Like Wayne Newton, give you a facelift
Lacerated with ceramic plates 'til you drip blood platelets
Leave you anemic, self-mutilation
While Willie Nelson is playing
On the radio station, on vacation
Don't take directions from a mental patient on medication
Asphyxiation fixated on hatred
Don't befriend a stranger
They got hidden agendas
Rocking suspenders
To leave your apenix chopped in a blender!
