Your vital signs cease, now it’s time you find peace
The preacher’s recital, The creature, a homicidal beast
Defeats you and leaves you beaten down on these divine streets, My crime speech leaves ya spine weak
Rob you of ya ounces and pounds, left ya head tissue red
Then I bounce, when your found, your pronounced officially dead
Spontaneous, ex-con zaniest, maniac, crack ya cranium, subcutaneous
Unsub, put you in a tub, drain your flesh
Submerge you under aqua like a submarine, brain death
Bullets lodged in ya skull, prostate enlarged, now ya asking “What’s Happening?” like Rerun and Raj
Murder tools in the garage, putting fools in the triage, letting off automatics in the mirage
I’ll never get charged, squad’s impenetrable, I get hard when playing God, super villain like General Zod

It’s a Murder Scene
Homicide detectives getting out of bed to work a Murder Scene
I was letting off the lead, wifey you heard her scream
Catching head from a dead bitch, a perverted dream
Invade ya crib like a burglar, with Jergen’s cream
Leave you in purgatory, my story is dirty schemes
Of leaving Candace Bergen in a pair of burgundy jeans
Blood squirting from the seams, it’s a Murder Scene

DT’s looking for clues, sneaker shoe prints, snooping around your apartment, being sneaky’s my blueprint
Exuberant, crook in the news, driving an Uber, F.U.B.A.R. your grill with a crowbar, now a blooper on YouTube
End up killed on my list, criminalists only need minimal Forensic evidence to conclude a subliminal gist
Of my actions, seminal fluid in vaginal, pinnacle stimulus for a feminist, swim in a bitch
Pantyhose mask on, slice through ya patio screen, slip a dick in ya fatty hoe while ya daddy-o screams
Fuck a detective’s jurisdiction, if intercepted the jury will find out how many dicks I put in chick victim’s rectums
Appreciate the trife, my knife shall abbreviate your life, alleviate your wife’s need for pipe, a deviant
Mischievous, sleazy, Season of the Witch, itchy trigger finger bitch, squeeze it, now you seizure, twitch

It’s a Murder Scene
Homicide detectives getting out of bed to work a Murder Scene
I was letting off the lead, wifey you heard her scream
Catching head from a dead bitch, a perverted dream
Invade ya crib like a burglar, with Jergen’s cream
Leave you in purgatory, my story is dirty schemes
Of leaving Candace Bergen in a pair of burgundy jeans
Blood squirting from the seams, it’s a Murder Scene
