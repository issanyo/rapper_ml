I'm surrounded by hatred and lust
Angels and dust, cocaine and sluts
Dangerous thugs, blaze you with guns
Lace you with drugs
Murderous cyborgs, disguised as blind men with guide-dogs
Design wars, final call, homicidal gore
Torture chambers and rape-rooms
The same goons, drinking Grey Goose and grape juice
What's really good or bad is relative
Never been beyond neutral
But if you fuck with my family I shoot you, I'm too crude
My poverty got me bugging committing armed robberies
Voted the most likely to probably die violently
Who the fuck are you, stupid?
I carry two clips
One to murder you, the other to shoot pigs
I'm like Miami Beach on new years eve
Blondie singing Rush Rush, give me yayo hanging with the Gipsy Kings
I spit these things
Major businessmen spitting flem
Kicking these raps and kick you in the face with Tims
Foot up on your desk
Four thousand square-foot office supplies
Fought to survive, torture your mind
Car-chase, two cop cars collide
On the Belt Parkway I'm rhymin' for the cop killin' to dive
Nothing's sacred anymore, take your last breath
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death - I'm obsessed
If superheroes were real, they'd be evil
Tora Bora to Tel Aviv
Take the shit over and never leave
American dream
Bleed like a heroin fiend
Heavy-metal heroin scene
Forever retrieve
Caught you with your guard down and my pistols up
Hit you with the four-pound and you spit some blood, faggot!
