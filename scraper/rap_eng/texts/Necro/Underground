The game is dead, but I guess I'm here to resurrect it
Bring this fame to my name, I take the game and perfect it
Undetected for a while, I knew they'd never suspect it
How a kid from Carolina comes up like an erection
Came with no protection, inflamed like an infection
Just killed Barbara Walters, only took me 60 seconds
Watched her bleed, red and blue split like an election
Plant the seed, knew it grew, dare to leave impressions
I wreck it on every record but I gotta thank my fans
Cause If it wasn't for them, I would never have a chance
To spit acid rain on the track, or drive a Benz
Sorry, Iâ€™m still dreaming, guess the hype went to my head
I guess the type of shit I've said in my songs has made me spread
Cause nowadays, kids dick ride till no end
I fear the consequence of the trouble that lies ahead
Cause my consciousness been confident I need to make amends

The underground didn't come around until my shit was heard
Keep straining to hear a sound but some things are better unheard
Some things are better deterred, deserve to be censored
But this is Rap X, curb stomps that leave em hurt
These swamps bury the dirt, these ponds they hide the purge
I'll leave a legacy with these lines, remain preserved
But now they're after me for my mind, the blessed curse
Inclined to copy rhymes, wouldn't mind if they asked first
Having trouble with the curve but I think that I got traction
Somebody call Christ cause I think that I found the passion
John Lennon too, I spit that shit you can't imagine
I'm destined to make it happen, pilot fate like I'm the captain
I breed through bloodlines, this creed like an assassin
We shoot the films fine, yelling' lights, camera, action
All my life these people tried to push till satisfaction
But I pushed away distractions, Lev Fer, the main attraction
