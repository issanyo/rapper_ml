[Intro]
A cannibal is a person who eats human flesh
There is much discussion as to whether cannibalism is an inherit characteristic in all human beings or animal impulses
Or whether cannibalism Stems only from the minds of man-beasts such as some of the most prolific serial-killers

[Verse 1]
Sick fucks with mild mannerisms practicing cannibalism
From Aztecs to starving North Koreans in prison
Living Hannibal's vision, can you stomach the luncheon?
We're butchering the human carcass for human consumption
Uncivilized atheists looking to devour you when you're dead
Cause in the head it spiritually empowers you
Overpopulation and famine, the problem's solved
They're eating people, there's no need to get cops involved
Partial birth abortion infants killed in vagina
You could buy body-parts, they're eating baby's in China
Practice the effigy as soon as you die
Reincarnate a vulture and eat the corpse of Christ, you will crucify
Patient zombie's leaving death-industry
Feast on the flesh of Clarice, cause young girls are the best to eat
At least that your parents that carve you the Bible supports cannibalism
Eat your children when God starves you

[Verse 2]
The last kaboom, Dahmer and Gein delved in it with shelves of it
Parts by the dozen sick like filthy clinic
Trapped with no food made you a mauler
Even moral Christians will be reduced to being the animal we all are
Will you survive like the film "Alive?"
When forced to face cannibalism like when the pilgrims arrived?
Albert Fish's fetish for individual mastication
Was his equivalent to masturbation
They're looking for people to kill consensually for thrills
Advertising for victims on cannibal URL
One victim ate himself with the killer
Then agreed to be slain
Strange, like Ray Liotta being fed his own brains
It's legal in Germany, believe me
Cannibals are celebrities, look at movies at UK TV
Dahmer action-figures, the families think it's perverted
The makers said "fuck it"
At least someone is eating off the murderers

[Outro:]
Jeffery I hate you! Jeffery's out of control! Don't [fuck] with me Jeffery, I'll kill you

On the related subject I must confess to you, I'm giving very serious thought to eating your wife

What the hell are you doing there sitting in the dark?

Thinking about cannibalism

Little is known about the effects of eating human flesh. Some studies have revealed tribes ritualistically cannibalizing became struck with Kuru, a disease of the brain later named the laughing disease causing hysterical laughter
