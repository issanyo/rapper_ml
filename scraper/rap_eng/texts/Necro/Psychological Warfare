[Intro]
Our story unfolds where we find young Jesus over-dosing on mainstream media propaganda. The actions of religous fanatics and constant occurrences of suicide bombings and acts of world terrorism.Seem to have taken a toll on young Jesus'fragile mind. And finally teetering on the frayed ends of sanity, he eventually snaps...

[Verse One]
The 6 o'clock news got me paranoid
Suspicious of any tan man who walks with a turban
I think the mans plans to have me off burning
So I spit the blam blam where he stores his learning
And ya'll can blame the newscaster while I aim for a new disaster
An Arab name is who I'm after
American history's new chapter: The End
Defending the mystery of a fools matter
George Bush comes up and the towers come down
George Bush runs a muck and the power goes down
George Bush don't give a fuck as the hour comes around
So George Bush gets bucked as I shower off a round
A man's clapped for his causes
And send an Instant Message cause there's Anthrax in the Post Office
I'm trying to put a pack in both bosses
Saddam and George W, celebrity ghost corpses

[Hook]
Psychological Warfare
{"Saddam Hussein must leave Iraq"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"Retaliation"} {"President Bush"}
It doesn't matter let them die

Psychological Warfare
{"48 hours"} {"Give up power"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"Brink of war with Iraq"}
It doesn't matter let them die

[Verse Two]
I hailed a Yellow Cab on Majesty to Mccoll
And left a time bomb in the back seat to explode
For the agents dispatching the code
And to the Taliban man who did exactly what he was told
I made my way to the FBI lobby
In a bullet-proof with 2 semi-automatics on me
I splattered them in a manner that was un-godly
And showed the Federal party what I learned playin' Atari
Now I hit the 6 o'clock news desk
Ran up and gave Patty Tom a bullet wound to her chest
Snatched up Tom Brokaw the (?) poked his jaw
Desert Storm before the calm is what he saw
(*gun shot*) That's for your fuckin' terror alert warning and
(*gun shot*) That's for always showing the World Trade falling and
(*gun shot*) That's for dividing Israel and Palestine
(*gun shot*) That's for blaming rap music for every crime

[Chorus]
Psychological Warfare
{"His policy is over"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"Homeland Security"}
It doesn't matter let them die

Psychological Warfare
{"Nation's threat level"} {"High alert"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"The security of the world"}
It doesn't matter let them all die

[Verse Three]
I'm in a war, fightin' the Lord, knowin' I gotta rhyme
Insightful core and I'm controlling your hollow mind
Spite the world, still showin' you how to climb
Standing with Michael Moore Bowling for Columbine
Grip you with fear then they spit death in your ear
Shed a tear for them to quit and they'll put lead in your rear
I thought we was after Bin Laden now we saving Iraq
Fought terror with bombing, they keep changing the facts
Take money from healthcare and put it towards warfare
Then draft the nigga's on welfare and kill them off fair
The government searches Iraq for weapons and bomb threats
Same government put crack and weapons in the projects
Remember Baghdad Bob hysterical threat
Another joke, hey George, find any chemical weapons yet?
Wanting to steal the oil from Saddam was the plan
Use the God as the scam
It's just a Vietnam in the sand

[Chorus]
Psychological Warfare
{"Coming days will bring"} {"Military"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"Weapons of mass destruction"}
It doesn't matter let them die

Psychological Warfare
{"Protect your country"}
It doesn't matter get them all scared
Psychological Lies
{"And we will not be intimidated"} {"By thugs"}
It doesn't matter let them all die
