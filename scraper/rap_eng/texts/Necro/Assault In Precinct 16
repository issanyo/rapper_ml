It's just another day in the precinct;
Assault on sixteen's with weaponry to peel wigs - & we don't feel shit
Verbal homicide to side with the realest
N' the future foresees the green with enemies depleted
We on that bar flex; it's time to bench-press
It's right I end stress with all of this aggressiveness
I got a sickness inside, it's called selfishness
The 'wouldn't piss on a burning bitches body' mindset I'm in
I better take my vitamins & say my prayers
Cos a lack of righteousness has got me mentally impaired
Tell God I'll meet him there when I'm stiff dead
To judge'is for the sins I've prepared that make my bed
But I'll never rest in this flesh; maybe life's just a test
N' if so I think I've failed every end
Lived on the ends with no ends; n' my will & testament'll
Be left to Nephews n' Nieces n' not 'friends'
Never grew up to drugs; I grew down to do some
So who, son, could fuck with Sutherland in the long run?
Better run when Sutherland come;
Cos I'm locked in solitary confinement, the assault on

Precinct 16, trapped behind bars still spitting these sixteen's;
Trying to live my dreams but I see concrete
So judge is how you will; I'ma write to these beats
I'm on precinct 16, trapped behind bars still spitting these sixteen's;
Trying to live my dreams but I see concrete
Write to beats till death rows under my feet

A-yo I'm locked inside corruption;
The blood-lusted system of Britain malfunctioned amongst us
So I'm fucked with pain that I'm suffering
Of wanting combustions n' eruptions of governments;
I lived as a gluten; for the punishment, I publicly publish it
In hopes of getting nourishment; my cerebrum's recovering
Institutionalised on these streets
Cross-faded as the time frame creeps behind steel
Beg & plead for every meal, served slops;
In the rotten apple of the Northern Brit crop
Wishing hard time'd stop so I write this hip-hop
That click, click, click, pops; I write these gunshots
I've writ my heart-off n' it's not done half-arsed
Behind bars like Gotti's squad with my teapot
To detox off hardships that we sunk-off
Still locked solitary confinement in assault of

Precinct 16, trapped behind bars still spitting these sixteen's;
Trying to live my dreams but I see concrete
So judge is how you will; I'ma write to these beats
I'm on precinct 16, trapped behind bars still spitting these sixteen's;
Trying to live my dreams but I see concrete
Write to beats till death rows under my feet
