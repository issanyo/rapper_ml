[Intro: Uncle Howie]
Glenwood motherfuckin' Projects! That was the fuckin' place, man. Fuckin' crack smoking all night, cooking it up, selling C4, weapons, blowguns, every motherfuckin' thing. What a fuckin' rush! We were cooking the shit up, and I smoked it up, and the Jamaicans man, they came back, fuckin' torched the place with me motherfuckin’ in it! I couldn't get out the fuckin' apartment, they locked me in, I had to go out the fuckin' window, it was fuckin' dynamite!

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
ILL Bill lost sanity, lost humanity
Lost in a maze of purple haze
Cannabis sativa, spit ether violently
Very vociferous, victorious
Hotter than a crematorium, I'll kill all of you
Kill you, mother-fuck you, drop dead, faggot it's the dragon
.44 Magnum splatter you in front of your family
My firearms never be tired, up in the air
Throw a bullet up in each eye, and one in your ear
I speak heroin, breathe weed, sniff cocaine
Tweaked levels when I peeped Courtney kill Cobain
We got the whole world scratching they heads
Our life is like a hijacked airliner but we managed to win
Back to the crib, breaking up the cash and the brick
Having a bitch flashing the tits while you crashing the whip
Laughing at hoes taking facials in amateur flicks
While the ILL Bill album's kidnapping your kids

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
I put the "D" into drugs and the "G" into Guns
I put the "D" into dubs and the "T" into Thugs
I put the "C" into 'caine and the "P" into Pain
The "G" into game (pop-pop) Three in your brain

[Verse 2: Necro]
I get impatient like a long bid
Get so vexed I hit the wrong kid
Shit gets awkward
Like I'm on a drug and I can't get off it
Blank out, rip the shank out
Treat you like Vietcong
Hit you like the weed in a bong
Your pussy like a G-string and thong
You think I'm sick? Fucked up? Oh am I?
You think you can't die?
Don't think you're crazy cause a year's passed by
Beat you down with my fucking hands tied
Now change your attitude
Before you get cracked from different latitudes
By kids that are mad at you
They expect gratitude, I'll strike a foe
Even if you don't know me you better act like you know
Especially if you're soft
I've earned my stripes like Schwarzkopf
The gun I bust off will tear through your clothes like a moth
You're sloppy, cuz you start beef and cop pleas
But not me!

[Chorus: ILL Bill]

[Verse 3: Goretex]
I rock sickening raps like Woody Allen flares beach hats
Or John Hinckley run up on politicians with ski caps
Laser weapons, I bleed coke
Happiness is like a warm gun
Tun up in your crib slitting your G's throat
Cruise the block whipping Uzis and pop
Losing the cops, whether New Lots or zooming through Watts
The newest space suit, love rocking titties like grapefruits
Phase two, Rasta-ice inverted Jesus
I'm up in Fatburger, bagging some codeine
So clean, pinstriped gat runners are OG's
Serving the fiends crack, dope and weed
Glenwood Projects - we living the American dream
Screaming “Hey pelican!” - trains of coke on my cock
Handlebars like Viveca with nipples and crotch
We toured drive-bys on the Mongoose with Glocks
This ain't rhetorical, the story gets worse, funny
You get shot!

[Chorus: ILL Bill]
