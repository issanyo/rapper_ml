[Chorus x2: Ill Bill]
Stronger than morphine, crazier than crack cocaine
Heavier than heroin dancin in your veins
Chasin the dragon, dancin on your grave, lace you with bangers Necro and Ill motherfuckin Bill lace you with madness

[Verse 1: Necro]
The satanic, Mephisto rap
Aristocrat of butchery, malevolent monarch of murder just kickin back
Loungin the four pound packin scoundrel
Gore hound clappin ya counsel
Wrappin you up surround ya grill with bandages
Strappin' you up, tie you up, deny you of freedom, mummify with creatons
The majestic dressed sick black gear baggy
Pessimistic blessed it react with fear when you see the maggy
Brutality part 1 mentality, arsenic
Lyrical sarcophagus like Metallica with Cliff
Black Mass Lucifer acid casket, back draft flame rap
Hit the crack pipe glass, blast it
An alien from another dimension
Experiencing tension with very serious blood drenching henchman
Mysterious, mystical, magical, miraculous
Some furious typical animals attack you for your shit

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
A murderous brain, the mind of a surgeon turned insane
We spooked out like vultures and birds of prey
Burn ya veins like heroin, my words are grey
They call me ill cause I'm sicker than the germs in aids
Young Vader, if my gun ain't it your mouth - keep it shut, hater
Take it down a notch, homie be a thug later
Not here, take it elsewhere
The'yll find your legs, then your arms, then your mother find your head next year
A masterpiece, cop killer, blast police
Laughin at the NYPD catastrophe
Lift you off your fuckin feet like a tractor beam
I'm sellin rap to teens like crack to fiends
Only after you lose everything is when your free to do anything that you want, and I'ma take it in blood
I'll feed you a feast of middle fingers and fuck yous
Fuck off, faggot, put my foot in your face, follow through

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Necro]
You'll catch a belligerent bludgeoning
By the metaphysical technician of execution, we'll cut your spleen
Surgically cuttin ya brain purposely, nervously
Labotamy fuckin', insane circuitry
Hip-hop autopsy rap cadaverous
The maverick of gun poppin' I'm on a not havin a kick
Entrepreneur gore rep it, tepic, like a septic
Schizo, I'm a sicko technically prospected

[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
Tried hard tryna blow up in the NYC
I won't stop untill Jordans rockin Ill Bills on his feet
The first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, hell fire island
Run up on you shootin' and start a riot
I'm like John Lesley in his prime emptyin' nines
Felony crimes are designed by the deadliest minds
A powerful weapon
My words sharp enough to leave audiences of thousands headless
Murder from mouth to mouth to legends

[Chorus x2]
