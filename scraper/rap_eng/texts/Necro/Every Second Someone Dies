[Hook (2x):]
Every second someone dies Someone just died
Another one's dead and again someone just died. Et Cetera
[Verse one:]
If you step I'll bring death to your rep don't get drunk kid and talk shit
You can't walk I wouldn't hawk I put a fork in your throat I stalk
At midnight I had a sick fight this kids forehead was split open with gore drippin'
I felt like I was trippin' awake for 48 hours
Like a snake slithering your death is riveting
Get kicked in the face with 20 feet
10 of my peeps stompin' your grill 'till your flesh is embedded in the street
My death rap will get you cats pumped end up in the back of a trunk
And your body is blended up into chunks
My mental is morbid I'm on some horror shit
My instrumental absorb it you'll get ripped off it

[Hook (2x):]
Every second someone dies Someone just died
Another one's dead and again someone just died. Et Cetera

[Verse two:]
I acquired the habit of a rapper fired jabbin' and stabbin' the funeral pie you're
A faggot
You should admire, you could expire
Cause if you fake the crooked or look in the trier I'll put you on fire
Chop your squat stomp your heart
You don't wanna get beat then repeat: "EVERYTHING NECRO DROPS IS GOD"!
I've been sent to hell can't imagine a day
When everything went well
You'll do as I wish or you'll be covered in my piss
Your blood was discovered in a ditch, shakin' the rubber with your mother's tits
Fuck a hundred rhymes you wrote, my one verse will grab you by your throat
Get the mediocracy joke
Out of you kid there's no democracy when you're yoked
Strangled with no cops in sight in the box you were poked
I feel complete satisfaction
Beating your ass until you're bleeding and gasping
Cause the words you were repeating were asking
I'm competing with Manson for the throne of all sickos
The shit's cretin's anthem

[Hook:]
Every second someone dies Someone just died
Another one's dead and again someone just died. Et Cetera. (2x)

Et Cetera. [8X]

[Loops on repeat and fades out:]
Every second someone dies...
