[Verse One: Necro]
Cockroaches
Billions breeding, roaming around since Genesis
Coming out through the crevices
Infested, walls filled with termites
Bugs'll intrude, looking for food
Coming out when there's no light!
They're small, but they make, humans nervous
You'll do a spastic jerk, if you spot one crawling on your epidermis
If you squeamish, you're save provided
When you sleep you keep your mouth closed, cause yo they might crawl up inside it
Uninvited, from out the Earth's core
Bugs are the only species that'll probably survive a nuclear war
And as you snore, they like to run to your door
Then explore, you won't notice when they're on your upside down floor
Schemin', he sees food and calls his boys in
But some ain't smart enough to evade the exterminator's poison
So the pest, takes it back to his nest
Contacting with another insect and begins to infect the rest
A lot die, but it's only a small fraction - we can't catch 'em
Cause there's always new eggs hatchin'

[Hook One:]
COCKROACHES!

[Verse Two: Necro]
Cockroaches, many perceive as evil
But if you're from The Projects, them niggas are like a deepoles!
They sleep with you, eat with you, listen and beef with you
Thousand lounging in your couch, some only they'll reproduce
They conceive they're crew, roaches got there own army
Generals, colonels, lieutenant, invading tenants
Your crib becomes a big roach motel, for all sorts of bugs
Poor homes for that can't afford copycat a free cockroach drugs
From out the cupboards, crawling is a crisis
I got baby roaches inside my food cartons camouflaged as spices
Once by accident, I ate 'em with my rice kid
Cause, when you're hungry you don't think twice kid
Yo there ain't a person on earth that never ate an insect
Cause every food warehouse in the US they infest
I used to give roaches funeral pyres, wrap 'em up -
In toilet paper, still alive and light em on fire!
So watch out, they'll come to get you, we're malicious
No war poo parties, up in your sink, swimming up in your dishes
