Robbery
Robbery
Robbery (Run)
Robbery (Give it up)

Your destination is a casket
When I put on my mask, kid
My task is seeing green
Killing you without being seen
That's the plan
You get swollen up when I stick, G
Your shits getting stolen
I'm rolling up on you quickly
I'm taking your Tommy Hilfiger coat
Clothesline from behind
Put the razor to this niggas throat
Stand still
Don't, make my hand kill
Fuck around; end up in a landfill
All over a grand bill
Money's something you shoulda gave up
Now your family has to dig a grave up
If you're one of them bitch, nigga, rich niggas with fancy clothes
You'll get attacked, by a mental case who's face is covered with pantyhose
I'm blasting, anyone that has a frown
Get, messed up with the pound
By a man, dressed up as a clown
You'll be dripping magenta lively
With no justice you'll die G
Cause you can't identify me

Robbery (Kid running)
Robbery (Give it up bitch)
Robbery (Hand it over Fuck)
Robbery
Robbery (Give it up)

Attackin' you dressed up like the villain from Cobra; un-sober
Wearing the mask like it was the end of October
Your life is over
In your pants you're peeing
When I pull out my fuckin' 3-pound and represent like I'm skiing (I've)
I've done more shit than you
You wanna see? I'll rehearse it on you
Try to fuckin' rob me
I'll flip it kid, and reverse it on you
Even if you're only 7
You'll become a victim quicker than Soon Yi Previn
You'll get sent to the lonely heaven
Don't go around, the places I lurk, whore
Cause I go berserk for
Everything you fucking work for
Don't think I won't cut your wench throat
I got the shotgun, under the trench coat
Plus when I get greedier, the media
Eats it up and you, fucking reporters
Get boners when Necro slaughters store owners
On video recorders
When I'm thinking, "there's always a face I must bash"
And if I'm seen from taking the green
Then I'm shaving off my moustache

Robbery (Run in her)
Robbery (Put it in the bag punk)
Robbery (Give it to me bitch)
Robbery (Empty your pockets and die son)
Robbery

(mimicking old woman)
"Oh! They stole my wallet! They took my pocket book
Police? He took my money. That white man over there"
