Life's riddles are strange, I'm sick of the days/daze the art of dying
To symbolize change, witness the pain
Blocks of free cheese, Becky sold her crib for coke
Slept with the baby and crushed her ribs in the middle of smoke
Close encounters, pedophiles in schools posing as janitors
Backgrouns checks where they collected the death tolls from Canada
Acura shootouts under my windows filled with passengers
Throwbacks splattered with brains, zip them up with no bandages
Anybody gets it, somebody wetted JMJ
No respect for his craft, shot in his face, laughed and they ran away
Too many massacres, too many babies pass away
I'm only blasting to comfort you humans in the last days

We turn the page, the inner self, it's the art of dying
The book of change  blood, we never stopped climbing
Time be moving too fast, it's just the art of dying
Police sirens, no food in the fridge, mama's crying

We turn the page, the inner self, it's the art of dying
The book of change  blood, we never stopped climbing
Time be moving too fast, it's just the art of dying
Police sirens, surviving this life, mama's dying

I asked God if I'm redeemed at all for things I seen and did
As a kid I grew up foul with bitterness from being poor
Beat up Puma's and pants, didn't understand
Fighting with mom, the pizza place don't take food stamps
I'm losing my grip, everybody's pops was strict
My uncle was cool till the cancer devoured his dick
I never looked back, I buried more souls than I knew
Eulogies so familiar to me, tears and the stench of glue
Predict apocalypse, cynic visions of two
Mini images of towns falling and women consumed
These killers have proved it boils down to oil and food
Another newscast hovers the clouds to poison the mood

Prescriptions we don't need, religion we don't feed
Get the Henny out, sellin up V's and smoking trees
Stay tanked up, double shanks up, spiritually bankrupt
Walk through Canarsie like Big banging, getting my gangs up
These little hoes selling  checks for stoges
Trading your diapers for dutches, benefits for clothes
Hocking freebies, she rocking on socks stinking of feces
Video bitches, easy to pop, most are disease freaks
Shorty with five seeds and three in her face
Whilin out, smoking krills up, puffing up in the baby's face
Get him some Ritalin, quick, he turns killer when
He starts illing, never got love, never to live again
Who break the cycle, his life is only to kill again
Once innocent but the hatred's turning on him again
