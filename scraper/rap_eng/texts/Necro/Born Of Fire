[Hook: Goretex]
Born of fire, feeling like I’ve been here before
My life’s flashing right in front of my face I think I see the door
They’re watching us all inside us with the monitors
Everybody lied to us, nuking, saying goodbye to us

[Verse 1: Goretex]
Rocking cloaks like Moses voking commandments
War between planets, a galaxy broken in fragments I saw the damage
It never mattered, when people died I was told to manage
Emotion frozen, being poor with no mattress
Surviving the madness, 3 baby moms and parents
I once raveled these actresses, drama queens and addicts
The backstabbers, deaf bitches and psychic vampires
Fliping on xanax, shit magnets I’m high on fire
Seeking the truth, Macormishday? I’m eager to shoot
Cinder blocks rock your dome if the reason is loot
Season to flip, kick the four fifths, sick is the whole clique
In Amsterdam window shop, I bought the whole strip
86 the projects were run by vets
Baby Manson’s pumping the thickest cables and sweats
Took food stamps and traded them for blank cassettes
Gang wars up in the elevators, shanks and techs
Blockhouse beepers, Acid washed pants in decks
Possessed shirt, 6th grade, Pentagram on the chest
I’m still stressed, real as a test, we sell amends
Memories are like tortured issues and burying friends

[Hook: Goretex]
Born of fire, feeling like I’ve been here before
My life’s flashing right in front of my face I think I see the door
They’re watching us all inside us with the monitors
Everybody lied to us, nuking, saying goodbye to us

[Verse 2: Goretex]
I remember being in camp, laughing with the corner staff
When Lennon got hit 6 times after an autograph
My math teacher caught a stroke in class
Sipping on water, he fell back choking on glass
3 in the mourning, the landlord machete’d the moms face
Coked out, looking for rent money she already paid
Right now he been already sprayed
Beheaded, flesh burned, diverted in a shallow grave, displayed
Mom dukes ain’t never been back since 76
A clear conscience, I think of his face when my berretta clicks
Selling shit, never trust a hater with your bitch
Rasing your kids, brainwashing 'em, changing their wigs
It’s a fake script, we lost 2 years when the planes hit
Same shit, liberty statue and bridges hit by the same clique
If that don’t do it, it’s cancer in the paint chips
Tainted evil, limited freedom, move us in space ships

[Hook: Goretex]
Born of fire, feeling like I’ve been here before
My life’s flashing right in front of my face I think I see the door
They’re watching us all inside us with the monitors
Everybody lied to us, nuking, saying goodbye to us
