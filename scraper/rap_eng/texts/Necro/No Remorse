Blast you with the Metallica
Rip ya head to shreds like Gallagher's sledge hammer
You're dead like the space shuttle challanger
Scar slashes, car crashes, guitar thrashers
Barbaric fascist, smashing you like Cassius
In a bar brawl smashed on Jager and hashish
War clashes, napalm blast hits, ashes to ashes
100 yard dashes through the pastures, landmines stashed in the grasses
Blood splashes on the bra of Onassis
Killing you is sweet like a jar of malasses
We're hard assassins rockin' dark glasses
Sarcastic, millitant like M.A.S.H. is
Tear gasses, burn like hot flashes
Bas in ya skull, blood drips down ya eye lashes
Bombastic like Comstock convicts
Assfucked, shanked with sharp plastic condoms

[Hook: x2]
Punch you dead in your face, snuff you, jux you, mush you, rush you, bust you
Any day, any place, any time, step, no remorse, no regret, rep it to the death
Set it off in the street, cock back gats, fists or weapons, whatever, attack
You don't want it with me, look into my eyes, Death Rap, listen to it, live it, die!

[Verse 2:]
Light you up, rabid oxidation, scintillation
Skin burn to a cinder, disintigration
Inferno wind, flame blazing
Tinder, luminosity, human atrocity
Fumigated found in ditches, bodies on top of bodies
Accumulated like compound interest
At the help with a splatter film axe, flank attack
Stomp you like a tanks caterpillar tracks
Overture of torture, let the crows get ya
Blood stained, Gorbachev's head, chrome wet ya
Packin like jack Ruby with a short fuse
Booby trap you, brapppp! You live on the news
Lapidation, foulness like Ralphus
Rapid heart palpitations, scalp you like Al Fish
Every subject is sticky, strictly thug
Let off a clip in ya mug publicly

[Hook: x2]
Punch you dead in your face, snuff you, jux you, mush you, rush you, bust you
Any day, any place, any time, step, no remorse, no regret, rep it to the death
Set it off in the street, cock back gats, fists or weapons, whatever, attack
You don't want it with me, look into my eyes, Death Rap, listen to it, live i
