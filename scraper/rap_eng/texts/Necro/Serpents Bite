[Intro]

You can find liberation from a serpent’s bite
While you work so hard that you can’t sleep nights

[Verse 1]

Peel your wig, catch you with a steel jig, you squeal like a pig
Pull the trig on my Sig bitch suck it it’s real big
Rep it like Gotti legendary for bludgeoning everybody
Could punch you in the head, get the machete dead you very bloody
Street can’t get enough of me, kicking something rough to the beat
Duff after duff, snuff after snuff, repeat
Built like Apollo Creed, evil like Hallows Eve
Bleed or follow the leader or you’ll swallow the nine millimeter heater
Sip a margarita in Panama getting my rest up
Watching Richard Pryor in a Lexus eating Cheetohs messed up
I got you, you got beef? What’s up, partner?
Now you want peace? Fuck Mahatma, I bury la cucharacha
You’re sweet like Jawbreakers, fuck the lawmakers
Break your jaw, catch a court case, beat it, slaughtered your face kid
Hit with a shotty blast, bullets rip from a nine
Put you in a full body cast, twist your spine like a Pilates class

[Hook]

You can find from a serpent’s bite
While you work so hard that you can’t sleep nights
You can find from a serpent’s bite
While you work so hard that you can’t sleep nights

[Verse 2]

Rapping’s the best thing that ever happened to me
No question, clapping you in the chest if you’re testy
Better give dap to me, putting soft motherfuckers in coffins
I make duckets off it, fuck it
Hit you with a sawed-off, watch you metamorph into a corpse
And got libido from Medusa in a bikini, my nina torpedo
Dead you like Benito Mussolini finito
I rock out like Randy the Ram hand-to-hand get clocked out
You’re a fag in a glam band caught with your cock out
Like the singer of Wham, fuck Van Damme, he got knocked out
Rocking like Bam Bam, I whip the Glock out and blam blam
You belong at the queer parade on the realest shit
You ain’t feeling this? You need a hearing aid
Stab your ear with a blade
Like I talk it, never walk away from beef G
Got more heart than Ann Wilson with stress on her heart from morbid obesity
Cracked with a bat like Mattingly, cut through your anatomy
Fuck you, I hurt your emotions? I didn’t know you had any

[Hook]

My liberation from a serpent’s bite
While you work so hard that you can’t sleep nights
You can find liberation from a serpent’s bite
While you work so hard that you can’t sleep nights

[Outro]

I gotta take my respect
I gotta, I gotta take my respect, respect
I gotta take my respect
I gotta, I gotta take my respect
I gotta take my respect
I gotta, I gotta take my respect, respect
I gotta take my respect
I gotta, I gotta take my respect
