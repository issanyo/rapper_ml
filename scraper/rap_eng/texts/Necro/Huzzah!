[Hook]
Drunk driving on a Wednesday
With three bitches and an MPV
Half a gallon of Georgi Porgi
And cranberry that's the POP
Peel-Off Passion, a recipe for terror
We mix them shits together
And then we having orgies
We live this life forever
We never gonna stop
You with us lemme hear you scream
Huzzah!

[First Verse]
Straight shots of vodka, straight shots of vodka
Slamdance with white hens from Czechoslovakia
Bank like a mobster, cutlass impostor
Shoot a bati boy in 'im head like a rasta
What's my name bitch? (Mr eXquire)
Don't forget the muthafuckin, without that it's nothin
I bring the ruckus, these niggas suck dick
They rap like some fags with they ballsacks tucked in
Damn my whole shit slow
God I ain't forget you
My nigga I ain't trippin just been goin through some issues
Back to the basics
Timbs' loosely laced In
On my '98 shit, do it just like Jay did from Brooklyn
Live from the 7-1-8 where
These niggas bust ya grape quick with no hesitation
Mind in the matrix is sorta Oceania like
Slumber party calling all the demons that I can't invite
Liver Shrivel Quickly When your Sippin On that Poison
Your pussy's so good my whole squad should enjoy it
Always Twittin bout your grindin, nigga that's annoying
Publicist asked me what's my gimmick, I said "Going In"
Man you only live once, might as well throw a fit
Snuff the shit outta hipster rappers for the fuck of it
Live by the mantra: live live, die never so
In other words, the real legacy breathes forever

[Hook]

[Second Verse]
Industry niggas think I'm nut-shrunk fuck them
Smut bitch, got some nice lips come and suck dick
Thumbs up big gun buck doing dumb shit
Life going up feeling like my guts eruptin
Stumbling, stuck cause my whole life crumbling
(It must suck to be him, it must suck to be him)
Him = me fuck this whole Henny bottle empty
Fuck til my dick is feeling empty
MetroCards, don't got no hemi
I ain't got a Charger
Charge card, D-class credit I'm retard
Flow like Dirty, raw like Willy Dynamite
Trying to ignite a revolution with the shit I write
Me and my niggas gonna take the world over
Me and my niggas gonna take the world over
No bucks to Oprah, never see me nervous
Abuhbuhbuh I fucked up on purpose

[Hook]

[Outro]
Disclaimer: I didn't make this song to promote the sale of alcohol
Hardly, uhh can't think of the word right now
Feel like my brain is fucked up from drinking alcohol
But uh, the distribution and shit, I didn't write this song for that
I wrote this song because I like drinking nigga, and I be drunk
That's why I wrote this song, hahaha fuck you
