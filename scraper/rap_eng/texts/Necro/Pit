[Intro]
Start a pit!
Start a pit!

[Verse 1: Necro]
I’m a dragon spitting out magma
Pop bangers, leave you like chopped angus
Hold an axe like Genghis Gun, I’m like a young Genghis Khan
Like a gang of ex-cons that hang up murder rates
Murder’s great, snapping, clapping you up
Chew up flesh like werewolves yapping
Victims, who’s up to bat? Smack em with a bat
Hack em into pieces, Jesus, Christ motherfuckers are pussy
Petrified, mortified, testified you all die
I’m the sort of guy that stays fortified
With a vest and a .45 wounds cauterized
Goons on the rise rebellion, one million felons yelling, “Necro, tell em!”
To hell with them, fuck politics
Buck at the cops, they can suck the cock

[Hook]

Start a pit! Do it! Now! Yeah!

[Verse 2]

Here’s a shank and a snuff, stop acting tough
I don’t like you, you’re not gangster enough
I’m at peace with reality, I got a blood feast mentality
You’re into bestiality, you fuck dogs and you suck logs
You’re into buttplugs, you don’t need drugs
So nice I’ll buck you up with a flare gun
Fuck you up in a fair one, stomp you with Air Ones
You get carried away, you literally get carried away on a stretcher pitifully
My bad your honour, I know I fucked up
But killing a cop is a badge of honour
You’re a queer in tights, dying like a deer in headlights
Strict with the nine like dead mice
Finally put your brain to sleep painfully
Kill you and laugh at you simultaneously

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Vintage, you’re cutting edge in one package
Gun-clappers backwards like a sexually active attractive nun with a strap-on
Crucifix dildo haunting the chapel
People you don’t want to street brawl or you’ll bleed
All over the place like I hit your nose with a speed ball
Like a psycho in jail with the brain of Michael Dell
Hit your brain with a rifle shell
Shit like an ex-lax pill, crack your skull
I’ll flip out like Axl Rose on Paxil
Don’t need Source or XXL to excel my career, it’s no career loss
Ride like a bicycle, smacked you up in high school
Like an icicle I’m ice cold
Foursomes in Toronto, orgies in Montreal, pervert, aren’t we all?

[Hook]
