Yo, I spit like an automatic, if I want it then I gotta have it
It's nothing for me to split your wig like a pomegranate
I'm raw, erratic. You bought a gat when you thought of Cam, it's
Common habit, I got 'em frantic as Roger Rabbit
Holy God, I'm rappin' for them have-nots
That's why I can't just stop 'cause rap's all that we got
So when I get it I'ma blow mad cash and flaunt
And you can talk shit about it all you faggots wants
I need a bad bitch, ass like an apricot
Going down like an acid drop, a couple grams of pot
Two cans of Rockstar+Vodkas to cast me off
While I'm lampin' to Travis Scott
All the yappin' stops when I tear up tracks, B
I'm rare like the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's taxi
Fuck a rap beef, don't you dare attack me
I eat MC quick, season 'em with teriyaki
What exactly the fuck do you hope to accomplish
Me takin' an L? Nah, homie that's nonsense
Don't even process thoughts with some insolent content
I'm a motherfuckin' monster on some Nicki Minaj shit
You'll get frostbit tryna touch the flow
Nothing's colder than what this motherfucker wrote
I'll cut your throat, don't mean to crush your hopes
And dreams, but what you do, it's so easy like Guns N Rose-
Es, bitch, I ain't for all the beef shit
They probably wanna do me like Notorious B-Ig
But I ain't worried, there ain't a mind gory as me kid
Bitch, you probably shop at Victoria's Secret
Man, you corny just keep it to yourself you lil bitch
I'm a big blue whale, you a helpless kelp fish
Rebellious, my enemies get dealt with
Inglorious Basterds, leave you scalpless
