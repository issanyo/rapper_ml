Check this Hustler shit out
This is for all you fucking gangster niggas out there..
There aaaaaall dedicated to the trife shit

This is for the kids on the corners with beepers and bangers
And low shirts on hangers
Loot and Timberland boots
Honeys that want to go clubbing or should I say 'Rubbing'
Up against Mack Daddies that drive black Caddies
And white continentals
Blasting my instrumental
Trunks, filled with blasting instruments like 'Biscuits'
BMW driven by hoodlums that will trouble you
If you don't let them hustle you, they'll snuff you
Cops will cuff you for no reason
Herbs are open season
Your man's committing treason cause your girl is skeezing
This is for the hard rocks that pack Glocks
Swinging balleries and socks eating daiquiris and locks
For niggas that box and hit the bag
Cellular phones and herringbones
Rings with large stones holmes and weapons galore
Like the double bladed knife inside my pocket
This is dedicated to the trife

Dedi-cated to the Trife
Dedicated to the Trife kid
I'm sexing your wife kid
Put the trife on
This is dedicated to the Trife with the butcher knife

Dedi-cated to the fucking Trife
Dedicated to the Trife, kid
I'm sexing your wife kid
Put the trife on
This is dedicated to the Trife with the butcher knife - for the trife

For the girls with big butts and kids with big guts
And HEARTS and honeys that dress up Friday night to meet me
And treat me with respect. I'm kicking this rhyme for crime
And kids that sell dimes but don't drop em'
For thugs that plot, shop for thugs that got pistols for sale
Selling more crystals than Gale
Tough guys that snuff guys for looking
Get arrested and spend the whole night in central booking
From Brooklyn to Manhattan
To Bronx to Queens
To Shoalin and Strong Island
Violently I get fucking greens
For the heads with cash and flip hash
And got a stash of loot that's trife
God bless your life

(Chorus)
