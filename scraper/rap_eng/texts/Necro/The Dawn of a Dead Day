[Verse 1]
My team is mean rugged demon thugs
Leave you drippin' a tsunami flood, streams of blood
Knock you out unconscious
Ox out stab shit decapitated wife dead naked with her box out
Tons of excitements of fuckin' indictments
Strike at night bitch when you sleep shove the pipe in
Don't look at the crook
Jeuxing a hooker looking to cook up a crack rock on the block in the Brook
Thumb cuffs for you dumb fucks
Leave you lumped up snuffed up dumped off with a dump-truck
Bleeding prefusely dying from a brain aneurysm like Bruce Lee
Hail Anarchism!
Get your heart broke ripped apart like an artichoke
Coroner sniffing a line of Florida coke
You could pick up the phone and ask for help
Or you could just accept your fate bastard, the casket dealt!

[Hook]
You tryna get away, blast your head away The Dawn of a Dead Day death; the better way
Let the beretta spray at your grill vendetta payed leave you on medicate, cut you with a stiletto blade

[Verse 2]
You're in a serious predicament, home invasion
You need cardiopulmonary resuscitation
I doubt you'll survive, lacerate your spleen
Firefighters arrive, yellow tape the scene
Said it black medivac show up when you get attacked
Shocking you with electrical volts to get you back!
Carefully secured to a stretcher you bled slow
Soon to retire like ?J_____ B____? I said so
Head to toe bullets leave you dead bro
Buck you in the dark when the gat spark peep the lead glow
You won't make it out alive you'll get taken out
Deliver death to your door like a paper-route
You're on some bitch shit always making a report
You fuck around with me you're not making it to court!
Poppin' clips decimate the populace, It's the Dawn of a Dead Day in the great necropolis

[Hook]
You tryna get away, blast your head away The Dawn of a Dead Day death; the better way
Let the baretta spray at your grill vendetta payed leave you on medicate, cut you with a stiletto blade (x5)
