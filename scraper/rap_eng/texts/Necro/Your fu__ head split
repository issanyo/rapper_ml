[necro]

Yo, Yeah
It's the shit right here
It makes me wanna kill somebody

[Verse 1]

Turn this shit up real fuckin loud
Drinkin the bile out your pancreas
The fanciest cancerous
Talkin lyricist pack a shank on the hips
Your a Skanky bitch slit your rist clitoris if your inhibited I'll Piss in your syphilis Incubus
Mr. Death Dr.Demise Surgeon slice
You'll die really slow if you don't appreciate life
Your wack if you don't appreciate knives
The way a knife slices precice it's trife it's a demonic device
The Chronic you light inhale
For those in jail
To those in beef get impaled and burried in snails
My brain's charred like burnt
Flesh your scarred rippin your breast apart digest your heart
Die

[Chorus]

Kid you know you can't fuck with this
Don't you know that my shit's to sick
Kid you know you can't fuck with this
You might get your whole fuckin head split

Kid you know you can't fuck with this
Don't you know that my shit's to sick
Kid you know you can't fuck with this
You might get your whole fuckin head split

[Verse 2]

You terrorize your whole click
Make you suck on your own tits
Now spit the cancer out
Grab a Glock call me sir manson alot
Blow your brains on the seats
Varicose veins on the streets cocaine,dust and weed
Kill you slowly it's a must you bleed
Pop a vein in your skull from the stress
Feelin numb in your chest
Anxiety attack murder you with a variety an axe a mac a black Jack a bat crack
Right upside your fuckin head
For talkin shit about this kid you bled sadistic and red
My biscuit pumps lead
Cock it obnoxious your chopped up in boxes im toxic my Topics are gothic
Morbidity you can't get rid of me
The reason is humidity is shit to me
So kill your self and write a note
Right before the noose wraps tight around your throat
Your wind pipe is choked
Newyork is filled with tranvestites in coats
Helpless wenches controlled and sacrificin goats
It's death for these 2nd street
Derelicts reppin it sellin shit malevolent
Mad felons kid
I got three in the fam me and my man
Will beat you with hands
Leave you beneath the sand
Your sinkin quikly
Im thinkin
Im sickly
I need Medication the cadabers are getting stinky

[Chorus]

Kid you know you can't fuck with this
Don't you know that my shit's to sick
Kid you know you can't fuck with this
You might get your whole fuckin head split

Kid you know you can't fuck with this
Don't you know that my shit's to sick
Kid you know you can't fuck with this
You might get your whole fuckin head split

Fuckin head split
Fuckin head split
Bitch
Fuckin head split
