(Verse 1)
The Canarsie coven, paints with G's and murderers
Addicts and cadillacs, slut teens and project burglars
Shiksas, swappers and gurglers, more food for the furnace
More goons and pounds of shrooms, more wounds to purchase
Glenwood mourge, third floor with gore in the winter, I'm flawless
Sinister tauren, crawling off of your sister
Date rape is boring, tissue sample's the best
I don't get stressed drugging these bitches, it's only at their own request
Unconscious and blessed, forget an apology
Too progressive, (similar to an atomic proctology?)
We stock rugers and bonesaws, crawling for sodomy
Zoloft smile, I'm wild, caught up in this Space Odyssey
Rest in peace, denim when we dress the deceased
Gets sprayed in the basin, the bloody mess, next to your feet
Too professional, I'm quick to chop you off like sectionals
Extreme makeover, rocking the pens like vegetables

[Chorus: Goretex]
The final takeover, get your wig cut, Extreme makeover
Desentitized, I don't feel a thing, the pain's over
Look in my eyes man, you'll die before the day is over
The newest change in your life, homie it's game over

[Verse 2: Goretex]
I was raised in black with a sick nat to attract women
Crack villains, we knocking off drug stores like Matt Dillon
Or Captain Trips, what's your poison, acid or dips?
Have em smacking each others tits in the back of the 6
Serial killers blowing up like Branch Davidians
Non Phixion insignia, cripple your camp like Syrians
See me, it's cool, haters tryna dump on my shit
Scissor fights since '74, they pumpin my clip
Different Bible studies, it's always 5Gs in commissary
These runaways, forever find pain, caged in my monastery
Six sadists, my fan base deranged like rapists
Nothing's changed, it's faith, all my drug pushers and sixth graders

[Chorus: Goretex]
The final takeover, get your wig cut, Extreme makeover
Desensitized, I don't feel a thing, the pain's over
Look in my eyes man, you'll die before the day is over
The newest change in your life, homie it's game over

[Verse 3: Goretex]
Knocking on heavens door, it's Gore, your guru was swami
Shoot you to pulp, flesh dangles like melted pastrami
You faggots are commies, swap cum like Macy in Cosbys
I'm like Ozzy in '68, moshpits and Zombies
Pound you to dust, home attendants changing your diaper
In between nights, I'm maintaining and training with snipers
Your wig is a rave, turned up with cake and crons
Haze blunts around the room while we burn the Quran
We on bodybags and tags for corpses that's vacant
It's a must without the fuss and compromise the cremation
So clean, murders scenes, devoid of conscience
Profit the doctor, scissor chops blocks, it's progress

[Chorus: Goretex]
The final takeover, get your wig cut, Extreme makeover
Desensitized, I don't feel a thing, the pain's over
Look in my eyes man, you'll die before the day is over
The newest change in your life, homie it's game over
