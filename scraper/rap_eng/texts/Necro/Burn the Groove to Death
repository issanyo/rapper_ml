Yo, insult to call your future's casket
I'mma break a cassette tape and stab you with the plastic
So bleed beautifully, roll up your shirt, strap on a belt
Start shootin' me, but draw no blood
Creep like I'm water bug
Peep the gore through blood, roll with a horde of thugs
Necro; the lord of drugs
Pay me for death till you got one brain cell left
No fib, you're in a prison up in your crib
Yo, you dead kid, no breath, grotesque til death
I'll leave my beef bloody
I cook it red, your future is as good as dead
I'll shove my blade in, see you could fade out
Your trapped in a time that's played out, go check the date out
You're a pussy that no one ate out, while my brains on fast foward
You're a victim and you don't even know it
The evil poet, you got no hands
You can't catch it when I throw it
Depression makes you cut dimes
Until your brain crashes like the streets without traffic signals and stop-signs
Cause everyday, is judgement day for me
Cause humans that don't know me get scared and run away from me
It's trife, hate hold the remote control the life
Channel your energy, cut through your foes like a soldier's knife
While the average front, I'm on a never-ending scavenger hunt
I'd rather be blunt so violate the fact you wanna die is great
Watch me annihilate
I got your sanity inside a jar and I'm dropping it off the Empire State
Cause you touchin' the mics; injustice, in muskets we trust kid, so bust clips
The verbal salt in my philosophy is molten
Cause my pupils can only see a world unwholesome, insulting, repulsive, revolting
Let's risk it for piles of green, with, sadistic violent schemes
Twisted like silent screams, I have a determination in
Seeing your termination through extermination, cold like a frozen igloo
Your rubber room is closing in on you
The chosen jig you, death, is, fucking you insane
You'll get nothing from my pockets
The only thing you got sewn up is your eye sockets
So play dead as I color you blood red
Give up the bread or I'll put a hole in your fuckin' skull large like a huge alien head
Incinerate the beat until it's six feet deep
Then do a jesus on 'em, do a crucifix, repeat, now watch me

Burn it to the death kid, send him to the cross yeah yeah yeah
Burn it to the death kid, send him to the cross yeah yeah yeah

The hour glass is filled with blow, sniff your time away
Sink into the snow and suffocate your fate, the mind decays
Strain the brain and spine will pay, there's no burden vermin vaccination
I'm doing a life bid in imagination, BITCH I don't gotta answer you
How 'bout I cancel you? Bury you with Satan, smoke up and do a dance for you
Morbid shit, peep me boppin' on your guts G
Watch your step, it's slippery when bloody, I'm bleeding sin
There's cancer in the air, you'll breathe it in
My whole steez is to achieve and win
Slice you leave you with uneven skin
It's apparent your transparent you can't conceal your lies
You're synthetic like women that are really guys
You got Jeff Healey's eyes, fuck you in your cunt group
I'll bring murder right to your front stoop, touch you with a comatosin' caress
I'll propose a toast to your death, I hope you'll decompose with one breath
I suppose I'll infest, I doubt you're fine
Peep the poison, here's enough of an amount to die
And the holes in your body; you ain't got enough fingers to count that high
After you lose, sparring my team for green, you'll be crying
So much your putrid smelling body will be washed clean
Rippin' the mics; I like to do with pride
It's necessary to bury, involuntary like mandatory suicide, government style
There's nothing more fresh than a skull covered with flesh
I'm dressed not to impress, I'm cold, laughing G
I'm so fly the SWAT team's after me
Cause everywhere I go, I bring a blood bath with me
Peep the creep creep, yo hemoglobin's cheap
Just look for it, it's skin deep
Each nigga next to you got eight accessible pints you can keep
Peep the black market, your girl ain't nothin' but a target
I'll gem start you up, mark you with an exclamation
Jux you in the jug, and I don't need no explanation
It's all sexploitation my slang has no expiration
Bloodied up, you're a sight for sore eyes
You'll be screaming for me when your cuts get basted in sodium chloride
I'm pulling your cards kid, I see the Ace of Spades
Death is in your future watch it parade 'til you're faced with blades
The reels reviled, your face in the jiffy bag is sealed
With a kiss of the deceased, I'm on a H.G Lewis blood feast
I run with the insane type, your life is like water floating down the drain pipe
A scream or cries, crack fiend demise
Open up your eyes and read between the lies
Now flip, imagine light up your kit
A whole drum kit, 'til there's no life in it
And spike him good to two pieces of crooked wood
Now beat me

Burn it to the death kid, send him to the cross yeah yeah yeah
Burn it to the death kid, send him to the cross yeah yeah yeah
