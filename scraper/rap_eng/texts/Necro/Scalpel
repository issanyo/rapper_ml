[Hook x1]

You're stabbed up with a scalpel
(a scalpel)
Stabbed up with a scalpel
(you're gettin cut, you're gettin cut, YOU'RE GETTIN CUT)
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
Cut through your adam's apple, kid you're baffled
(baffled, gettin cut)

Yo I'm packin scalpels
I stole em from the hospital
I gots to kill
If you step representin this gospel
Killin me is mission impossible
There's many weapons
Machetes and buck knives will slice through intestines
But what will cut open a gut like butter?
It comes from the family of the box cutter
The scalpel - the surgery master
Lacerating brains and tissue
How I do it remains the issue
I'm in a doctors office getting a checkup
He leaves the room so I start searchin through drawers
I find test tubes and gauze
Blood deposits and gore
And hypodermic needles galore - just what I'm lookin for
Paraphenelia for movies
Grab a couple scalpels to pack up my baseball cap
In case you try to remove me - from earth
Remove the beauty from your face, til you feel disgraced
Walkin in public like you got a leprosy case

[Hook with variation x1]
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
(a scalpel)
Stabbed up with a scalpel
(You're gettin sliced, you're gettin sliced, YOU'RE GETTIN SLICED)
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
Cut through your adam's apple, kid you're baffled
(baffled, gettin cut, gettin cut cut cut)

It's logical I rap violently, you know I hate you so die for me
Sadistic's how it ought to be, carve you like a creature
(slice)
I pack a gun and a blade
Yo son you're destined to die - with the crew you're with
Right between your eyes - I STAB UP YOUR INSIDES
Your blood is trickling down
Drip, drop, SLICE
You're running - your pace is picking up
Your face is dripping blood - I'm coming
You're screaming - nobody hears you like you're dreaming
The scalpel is right behind you - ready to slice you uneven
My name is scalpel - I cut open the filthiest people
In the hands of doctors that are evil
Doctors that abuse the use of needles
Doctors that use me to rip flesh when they didn't need to
They use me for autopsies on dead bodies
The morticians got me in his hand constantly
I'm his man for atrocities
They call me in to rip open the flesh
To find out the cause of DEATH

[Last hook and variation x1]
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
(a scalpel)
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
(you're gettin cut, you're gettin cut)
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
Cut through your adam's apple (bitch) kid you're baffled
You're stabbed up with a scalpel
(stabbed up with a scalpel, gettin stabbed gettin stabbed up with a scalpel)
Gettin CUT CUT CUT
You're stabbed up with a scalpel, bitch
Kid you're baffled
Fuckin pussy
You're gettin juxed, you're gettin juxed, you're gettin juxed
You're gettin all fuckin stabbed
