[Mr. Hyde]
Watch me ignite this shit, like a fiend's pipe hit
Yo I do this for thugs leavin' the righteous split
Niggas turn into dashers at the sight of my blaster
You might be type quick but son my bullets run faster
Bustin' off shots, got you clutching ya knot
Try to plug up the holes, the blood is gushing a lot
Put on my brass knuckles, hit you wit a jab or two
Now I'm sent to stab a dude, turn him into magget food
Jackin' a magazine, yeah I'll be done with it quick
Watch me empty out clips like a son of a bitch
No remorse in my heart, I've been rotten since birth
Make sure I finish the job of kids I'm plottin' to hurt
I'm huntin' for a skirt, if she's beautiful, drug her
And if I'm mad ripped I got the Louisville slugger
Ken Griffey swing with an axe at ya face
Little pieces of ya skulls all over the place
Attack a chick, immaculate, never miss the target
Open up ya mouth son, I'll use my fist to clog it
Dead a for real, you betta get up ya shield
Cause when I set up  to peel, shit you'll be wet as a seal
Your fleet might be deep, but I'm rollin' wit worse thugs
Prone to burse slugs, like Stallone the 'First Blood'

[Necro]
We get in real fights, with all my might hit you with steel pipes
Leave you wit flesh bites, that won't heal right, if I feel spite
You dick suckin whore, bitch you ain't Chuck Norris
Bullets travel through skulls like fuckin explorers
Evil like the auras and coroners, holding foreign objects
To process, to cut ya spleen like sub marine destroyers
Punches to ya head in bunches
Your goin down like munchkins doin lunges
Rippin through stomach muscles like crunches
Like metal numchucks, smashin ya ribs till they're soft like sponges
Coughin up a lung of blood cells
All you super guys will get pulverized
When we brawl unsupervised, your eyes are red like Jupiter's skies
Like having your pupil stomped by a storm trooper
Brutal demise, repeated pain like I'm loopin up cries
Boxing like romans and ancient greeks, in the middle ages creeks
For a spiked glove youll get dangerously beat
Fuck breaking through floor boards, wit war lords
And maintain jail, hard like chain mail, and broad swords

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Street veteran, we crack ya head you need excederin
Ain't no fear here
A man steps, we shreddin 'em
Veterans, ya gear we reddinin
When the Glocks pop, you drop so hard you crack the sediment

[Mr. Hyde]
A flurry of shots'll shank you like Triceratops
Leave you wet like when the bottle of Sherry pops in ya grill
Its foul like little babies licking cock
You disgust me, like old ladies wit chicken pocks
Equal rights, if the bitch steps outta line I'll have to fight her
Male or female, I'll drink ya blood like apple cider
Wish master, pulling out my bitch blaster
You're dead and I'm breathin cause I empty clips faster
Thuggin it out, my clique is obnoxious
We'll jig you wit lock picks and dig in your pockets
Flash techs directly through your raver ex
Pierce flesh and bones as worms bless ya dome
I'm decked in fatigues and steel combat boots
Aim for your front tooth, then cold stomp that loose
Cold merciless, hookers flirt wit this
Nine inch cock I pack just to hurt you bitch
And fuck gangsta rap cause I'll shank ya back
Its hyde hollowtips verse ya'll blanks and caps
All lucky kids that fought me already know
Cause I left her body stinking like Courtneys sweaty hole
You steppin ta us without a weapon ta bust
We'll jack you outcha rangerover, make you trek on the bus

[Necro]
You'll have your head handed to you, end up a dead bandit
Slayed by the commander of brutal, you betta understand it
We using fistacuffs and pistol snuffs
To call ya bluffs, if your full of fluff and you think you're mister tough
You'll remain a peasant, pain is unpleasant
Like eating the brain of pheasant
Destroy you like crack cocaine resin
Like a trauma'd abortion
Bring it to you like armored horseman
Smashing you like the arms of 'Foreman'
This is benly drama endorsment
A supporter of gore enforcement
Cock, brain splattered on floor cement
Seeing cattle killed is similar to men dying
On European battle fields, shit is that real, I'm not lying
You might be missing, despite tradition we try to fight efficient
Were like weapons that move fast, like the light in the prism
Homes take it off, make a choice, get hit wit bone
Breaking force in ya trachea till you can't make a voice
Enter the prize ring know as the streets
A survive thing if you're weak and we known as cadaver or meat

[Hook]
