[Hook One: Non-Phixion]
Yeah yeah I shot Reagan
Fuckin' pagan ate falafel with Menachem Begin
Who the fuck is Carl Sagan?

[Hook Two: Non-Phixion]
I'm the space invader
Ill hieroglyphic translation navigator
Read your thoughts, make you think we chill
Then I blast you later

[Verse One: Sabac Red]
We burn the fuckin' flag
I shot the Devil down like we in Baghdad
His wife's the hostage
Her bodyparts up in a grab bag
Now watch the gun blast, holdin' your chest, marked for death
The President's been shot, somebody notify the press
It's all Reaganomics, welfare, weapons and drugs
The government is thugs, that's why the leader caught a slug
Handle your business, we're writin' Yiddish on your wishlist
My mind's the sickest, deknowledged devils on my shitlist

[Verse Two: Necro]
Necrodamus, hip-hop psychic, bring you the next shady election
Then infected your mind was unprotected
You think me approaching you with a knife looks bad
It'll be worse, when I slice up your flesh it look all plaid
Keep the muskets up in the bookbag, and when a crook stabs
You in the brain, verbally you feel like you dog tagged
The mental grave, which you buried under the dug plot
The walk-in drug spot, a nice picture for me the mug shot, what?

[Hook One] 2X

[Verse Three: Goretex]
Super secret surveillance assailants, Hebrews in Kansas
Wrap you up in bandage, mummified stitch weapons I brandish
Like trucks and bum, coffins airtight, mucus and bed sores
Russian Roulette with bloody headbands, Christopher Walken type
A Deer Hunter, parts unknown, rockin the jeweled throne
Like Solomon, I killed your congressman with two stones
Best in the fuckin country, Israeli camou' dressed bummy
Ghetto guerillas, religious cats be thinkin' Muncie
My solar sect stretch throughout rocks like Stan Goetz
And my vestibule bang on my chest from bad sess
Come and challenge or battle, get skull-fucked, but don't be sore
God ultimately saves those whose motive is pure

[Hook One] 2X

[Verse Four: Ill Bill]
We Elohim, alien brain in my cranium
They locked me in a sanitarium, behind walls of titanium
Fifty-One forbidden classified spy Area
Doctors from Nigeria, Lebanon interior
South Bronx, I walk through epochs and airlocks
Disengagin doorways into time, breakin' cellblock number 13
The Earth scene, reverse gleam, a life beyond, humanoid existence
From light-year distances
I navigate rip the fabric of space in this race against time
Transmit a message backwards through the phone lines
Control minds with fairly common alien technocracy
We laugh at your misguided principals and prophecies
My species shapeshift, take on the form of an Earthling
If I fail to return back home, alert the King
Bring the reinforcements, program the telport coordinates
My spatial origin's the starting point begin your voyage
Into mystery, strange universes, strange history
Yeah I shot your fuckin President, you know my steez!
Not Public Enemy, except we non-fiction, Non-Phixion
Positive and negative because the world's a contradiction
