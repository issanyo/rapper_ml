[Intro 1: American Psycho sample]
It's not good any more, it's a cash bar, $25
You're a fucking ugly bitch
I want to stab you to death and then play around with your blood

[Intro 2: Necro]
Yo word up get the fucking mop
Ain't bout to leave all your fucking blood on the floor
Bitch we will..

[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef

[Verse 1: Mr. Hyde]
When Mr. Hyde enters the room you'll reside inside a tomb
When I off you with the blade in a coffin's where you stay
There ain't a fucker rough enough or tough enough to step it
And God forbid you knuckle up you'll probably get snuffed to death
I'll Hook a right and a left my juks will spike in your flesh
But you received it like a man and took it right in your chest
Y'all are thinking that you're thugs I'ma split open your jugs
Rather spit at you with slugs than kick and get blood on my Lugs
Never acted fucking nice, like to hack and cut, and slice
If you front it's logical that I attack you with a knife
I stay strapped and shady cause I'm packing a 380
After life decision makers wanna banish me to Hades
But I'm still gripping the heat spraying off a pound of shells
Gonna need a thicker leash to restrain the hounds of hell
See my bloody fists'll drip then I'll add like 50 kicks
To your cranium I'm Damien with the biscuit itch
My whole crew is sick known to start some stupid shit
And if you disrespect you'll probably see a troop of kids
They'll be marching to your door strapping hard to start a war
They'll wait for my demand the command to spark the gore

[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef

[Verse 2: Mr. Hyde]
My sick thoughts'll provoke a pitchfork in your throat
You'll get tossed in a moat your torn corpse didn't float
There's too many holes in it, your flesh and your clothes are ripped
From head to toes you're bit, food for the chosen fish
Shut up and slice it's time to cut up and dice
I'll drink every last gulp wasting blood isn't nice
When I'm going to the shortage of gawking to the slaughters
Just shed some fucking fluid and induce the Rigor Mortis
Your pulse rate'll cease as I'm unloadin' my shotty
Then wait for the police to come and catch a boneless body
It's a bad afternoon when you're stabbed with the spoon
Jab 'til ya wounds filter laughter, it's June
I'm trudging through blood with guts stuck in my Timbs
After my bludgeoning blood saws and cut off your limbs
You can beg me but earnestly your life ain't concerning me
The crimson and burgundy you drip for eternity

[Hook: Necro]
Spill your blood on the concrete
Split your mug and let you leak
Holding guns and rolling deep
Psycho thugs you don't want beef

[Outro: Mr. Hyde]
Yo that's right you little fucking bitches it's Mr. Hyde in your grill
I'll spill your fucking blood
MCC will spill your fucking blood
Psycho+Logical spills your fuckin blood
Junkyard Dog will spill your fucking blood
Fat motherfucking Pat will spill your fucking blood
Stick an AIDS needle in your arm full of cats blood
Motherfuckers is not playing, 2004
