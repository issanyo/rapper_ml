[Verse 1:]
Futuristic, brutal, super sadistic, evil trooper with biscuits inflicting sutures
Frigid like the physics of Pluto
Feaudal aristocrat, Lucifer, Mephisto, forensic scientist, shooting ballistics you're stupid like a group of autistic
Muscular dystrophy, immune deficiency, spastic, cystic fibrosis, mononucleosis, in a casket
Keep it ruthless like a terrorist coup, blitz shit like sickness in ya lumber disc, trick you like neuro linguistics
Programmed like a moog, compose a fugue in vulgar vogue, a rogue like Krug with a Ruger, kill you on YouTube
Monarch of carcasses, cannibalistic Ebonics, cadaverous characteristics, electronics, psychotic phonics
Amplification of acoustics, amputation, smash you with a pool stick, one of damnation's ramifications, too sick
Krills rap, leave you blinded like Ronnie Milsap, poke ya pupils out, glaucoma, lupus, cataracts, putrid, feel that

[Hook:]
Technician Of Execution
Mechanically murderous
The brutalest rapper on-
Comfortable pumping a full clip into the wonderful front of your skull
Technician Of Execution

[Verse 2:]
Robotic engineering, technical pattern, microscopic, ventricle atoms, optically appearing on a pentacle splattered
Flow like interferon, neurons, neutrons, cold like Freon, you fucking peon, Small like croutons
You Botox fag like Gabbana, doing bukkake and colonic, queer, gerbils and Richard Gere, Pilates, you swallow prick
Played like Madden, you're a madam, destroy like Brad Pitt in Troy, death wish you like Aladdin, battered with the gat end
Demonic, dreary, meant to kill, feel flattered if I attack you, and shove a steel blade in your Adam's apple, I'm real passionate
Peel ya cap back, lacerate, you should back track, ya actions you get backslapped
You're fascinated by my reaction
You neurotic, God fearing, respectable, patron, hard of hearing genital, you can't fathom why I create sin
Poppin' off gats 'til they're empty, my tentacles jabbin' like Joppy, impeccably stabbin' up rats like Hendry

[Hook]
