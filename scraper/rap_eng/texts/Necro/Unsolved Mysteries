[Intro]
Yeah, they try to keep us in the dark
By all these things that go on
I'm just questioning this shit right here
Ya'I mean? I think it's time that we, uh, figure out some of these
Unsolved mysteries, yeah, yeah
Unsolved mysteries

[Verse 1]
Who was behind the brutal death of Malcolm X?
Can we believe what was said by the crowd and the press?
The FBI and CIA knew all steps and all ties
Was it the nation? Someone just hating unorganized crimes
Was JFK killed by eyes [?] secret society
That carry out the rituals? Stop lying to me
I want the truth about Morris, and did he die in the tub
Or did he hide out in France so he can write about love?
Open your wallets, look at symbols hidden in dollars
Who killed Jason Mizell, 2Pac and Christopher Wallace?
This may be the information that only the feds know
Is Hopper and Giants Stadium under the N-zone?
Do mole people in New York city really exist?
Does Bigfoot in the United States, cold in the mist?
Were there really dinosaurs? We must learn from our history
This is why I tell the stories of unsolved mysteries

[Hook x2: Sabac & Necro]
These are unsolved mysteries (unsolved)
Unsolved mysteries (unsolved)

[Verse 2]
Does the government mold sicknesses and hold the antidotes?
Were the Marilyn snipers part of the satanic cult?
Was there atlantians, and did Atlantis sink in the sea?
Were they conquered by the greeks, what does this mystery mean?
What happens when we die, aside from our religions beliefs?
Is there life after death or some type of rigorous sleep?
Numerology is the mystery, the seconds enforced
What cause the sicilians to merge within descendants of [?]
Is there life on Mars, are there angels flying in heaven?
Did they shoot down the plane in Pennsylvania on 911?
Did Bush know of the attacks, try to cover and forget it?
Was the truth in the science [?]
It's pathetic that aliens are controlling our minds
[?] triangle that set the peace only define
I find it odd that our life is really left after God
But I refuse to be a part of being left in the dark

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Chupacabras, man on the Moon, predictions, Nostradamus
Anti-gravity, [?] convictions or holy promise
Alien abduction, combussion, sources of free energy
Explain how we retain if we lain out war with the enemies
The probes, UFOs to the dead sea scrolls
How is it most of us human stand out we often see goes?
Man in black know it's all planned [?] the poltergeist
Pyramids, time machines, we're getting hexed over night
[?]
Levitation from the ancient [?]
It's Israel, hollow Earth, the order of skull & bones
We seem prone and protect, but full of what is unknown
Now we question the connection between theory and men
What does it mean when [?] bless [?]
You can't stand the feel of pain, but it is all in your head
Maybe these answers are explained once we're all dead

[Hook x2]
