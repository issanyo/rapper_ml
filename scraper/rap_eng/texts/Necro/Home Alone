[Chorus: Benny Troung]
I'm home alone like Macaulay Culkin
I feel more alone than Michael Jackson
Come have sex in my small apartment
It smells like smoke, Franzia and vomit

[Verse 1: Benny Troung]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy yay
They gon' put the Troungster's balls on display
Bronzed and engraved, at the Smithsonian
Tourists take pics, they all wanna pose with them
"Benny are you dead?"
I'm working on my mixtape
I ain't take a shower in four, five, six days
Seven maybe eight, I done lost count
Off the grid, offline, on drugs, locked out
Last night she was a playmate from Moscow
Wake up and she's the Great Ape with monobrow
Anyhow
I've been making poor choices lately
Don't blame me, it's the voices baby
My food addiction
My booze addiction
Collection of albums from New Edition
My third addiction
A poon addiction
Why Pornhub ain't got no Jewish bitches? (Huh?)

[Chorus: Benny Troung] x 2
I'm home alone like Macaulay Culkin
I feel more alone than Michael Jackson
Come have sex in my small apartment
It smells like smoke, Franzia and vomit

[Verse 2: Benny Troung]
Rhyming for days, I'm in a daze
I'm so high I think I might buy me some grapes
Lie on the couch, tell a bitch feed me
Treat me like Caesar, Turn on the TV
Turning on the News, another man shooting
Shooting at the movies, man that's stupid
If you gonna do it, don't shoot at students
[Words in reverse]
Shoot a politican, uzis, or a lobbyist
Find his offices, come back tomorrow
On a way to an (?)
[Words in reverse]
But no Al Qaeda
I'm more Al Bundy
Horny and Hungry
The fuck you want from me?
La de dah de
We like to party
All by ourselves in the dark with a 40
Me so horny
Please don't ignore me
Girl I need pussy, It's three in the morning

[Chorus: Benny Troung] x 2
I'm home alone like Macaulay Culkin
I feel more alone than Michael Jackson
Come have sex in my small apartment
It smells like smoke, Franzia and vomit
