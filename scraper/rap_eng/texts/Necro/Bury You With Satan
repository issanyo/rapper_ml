[Hook: Necro]
(Yo yo)
Bury you with Satan
(Peep the death rap)
Bury you with Satan
Death is in your future

[Verse 1: Necro]
I'm getting outrageous on you, pulling razors on you
Blazing on you, twelve gauges on you
Amazing; the ways I put your veins on you
I'll warn you, I'll bring euthanasia upon you
On some Shocking Asia shit
Split your face and spit on your corpse; you're a goner
Wrapped, stabbed, flesh juxed quick and grab your neck
Bludgeon you bloody, you buddy? you're stupid
What's after death?
You must be after gettin' half your body cut in half
And after the aftermath of the bloodbath, I'll have my laughter
You stupid fucks'll catch crew cuts
A chainsaw'll take the top of your brain off
Stabbin' the two nuts of a Klu Klux - with scalpels
My rap'll leave you shackled, my rap is like crack inside a capsule
I'll shove an axe in you at your axel
Your main point, your midsection, where your ribs are flexin'
Infested with injections; you can't get rid of the infection
Kid you're destined for the death; dead walkin' flesh
It's awkward walkin' through the streets dressed, being a corpse is next
Make a mistake, a blade'll take ya life away
Leave you decayed inside a lake and break your neck down to the spinal blade
The gore shit I kick is sick cause I'm a bitter kid
I'll stick and vic you bitch, rip you to pieces, pick you out a ditch
Go devour dick, you coward
Catch a thousand hits around your skull
You won't get yourself nowhere biting our shit
Niggas know who did it; kid you did it, kicking it like you bit it
You never lived it, kick in his head 'til it split-ted
Open and liquid, soak in a haemoglobin ocean
You're a victim, you're no one, I see him scopin', I choke him

[Hook x4: Necro]
Bury you with Satan
Bury you with Satan
Death is in your future

[Verse 2: Necro]
You're in for it, my sins are horrid, explore it
'Cause death is torrid, you'll be dead for it; endure it
Morbid, cold like Nordic, the hydrochloric; pour it
Onto your arm, it's awesome, watch it melt the skin right off it
Right to the bone, forfeit, I offer you Morphine
And a chance to escape a coffin; enter my auction
Become a slave, I got nuns depraved
Under my cave, I got a hundred ways to murder all of you gays
I'm ambitious for leavin' you in stitches, I won't give up hope
Seeing you hang from a rope, achieve my goal
Let the meat cleaver unfold, you traveled a great distance
And you still ain't sadistic, wait for assistance
You'll hate your own existence, persistence overcomes resistance
When I persist to bash my fist in your face from instinct

[Hook x5: Necro]
Bury you with Satan
Bury you with Satan
Death is in your future
