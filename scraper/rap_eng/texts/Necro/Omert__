[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
Let off the pistol chrome at any Joe Pistone
Confess to an Episcopal bishop how my biscuit clipped domes
The biggest mob figures and gunslingers together
In the same room for a ritual, my trigger finger's severed
As this card burns, may my soul burn in hell forever
If I betray the oath of omerta
Don't push a button man's button
I'll bloody up anyone that butt in
And stab your man's gut in
Blood in, blood out, rammed up the butt end
For your moronic plea copping
Cause they caught you with electronic eavesdropping
Now something demonic, screamin: Please stop him!
Stop the meat cleaver chop him
Can't - that's our society's secret keep-him-quiet option
The boss will sanction a shanking, then you'll thank him
For the privilege of being ranked as the pillager of anxious action
My council varies, concealed pencil like utensil
In your frontal lobe mental, thank you, consigliere

[ Chorus: Necro ]
We'll murder anybody, anytime, anyplace
At the snap of a finger, pop you in the face
Issue contracts to kill people, never say us
We'll sentence you to motherfucking death if you betray us
Peace to all the gangsters doin time in Marion
Rikers, Leavenworth, Folsom, Attica - we'll carry on
Tradition, the most powerful
Godfathers in America, G Rap and Necro, you cowards fold

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
Balls get slit on a fraudulent bitch, hauled in a ditch
Rope all on his wrist, fist all on the fifth, paint the wall with your shit
No luck, fuck boy, you non-McCoy, unofficial
I squeeze hard on the pistol, make your artery sizzle
Get laid down, put the trey pound god on your whistle
To your sodomy tickles, shit'll harden your nipples
Make you sleep longer than Van Winkle
Fuck stomach cuts, I hold your stomach guts in my hands mangled
Tuck chromey in a tuxedo, tussle lonely
Like fuck any Tough Tony, plus his homies
Thug hobby clown, you Bobby Brown's Tenderoni
Leave your mom's head in your bed, we don't touch ponies
Ballads with violence, leave niggas 40 caliber style bent
Foul as Afghan Taliban wild men
Screw on silencers and eat salad over the violins
Commission vote for slittin your throat, niggas is prowlin

[ Chorus: Necro ]
