When I I get cut I look in to my incisions
And I see morbid visions
Red symbols and strange men sacrificing pigeons
After I
Read a satanic parchment I break in to the apartments
Of women who've had breast enlargement
And if I get caught
I'm gone tell the cops Manson made me do it
Cause it was the smell of vaginal fluid
It turns me criminally insane, temporarily
Not saying I'm not foul
Permanently necessarily
It merrily
Means I'm one sick kid fella G who sings a melody
Of infidelity
My militant infantry
Shows kids no sympathy
My evil symphony
Will leave you a victim of infamy
