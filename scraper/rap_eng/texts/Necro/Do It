[Intro from Chopper movie when Chopper shot Nevil]

[Necro]
Rugged like Pentridge Prison where Chopper was thuggin'
Inflicting ventrical incisions on inmates
With cool blades home made scissors
I'll teach you how too shoot friends and influence people
Happiness is warm gun, my nine represents evil
The most feared underworld executioner
Stab you in the neck, its a gruesome conclusion for ya
A bloody nuisance and need a transfusion for ya
Mass confusion I'll blurt if you ask [?]
Study this your in a pool of blood like piss
Dying, you slept on me, you forgot what thuglife is
Reading the crime memoirs candidly confessing to murder, arson, and torture might gladly teach you a lesson
A head hunter, leaving you cunts dead if you front
With a sawn off double brarrel shot gun lead thumper
If I fall, I get up holding a gat baby
The opera ain't over 'til someone shoots the fuckin fat lady

[Hook: Chopper Read]
Get in, do it, and get out blood free
Walk up, bang bang, step back quick
When the blood hits the floor, I'm six feet away
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em fast, and get out quick
Get in, do it, and get out blood free
Walk up, bang bang, step back quick
When the blood hits the floor, I'm six feet away
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em fast, and get out quick

[Necro]
You're not thinking clear motherfucker you're stinking of fear
You get chopped in the head or fucking shot dead while drinking beer
Don't give a fuck if there's a lot of you
Bust a shot at you, I got at you
Paid heaps to have motherfuckers body you
I'm popular, for poppin' shit off
Probably gettin' pissed off
And punching you in the face properly
Possibly my enemies thought I got shot
But I'm walking around physically intact, and you're not
I got a bullet with your name on it
I don't see you dodgin' it
Unless some how you get your brain armored
You get whacked in this chess game, death game
Pawns, rooks, kights, bishops, crooks
Stick up through your chest frame
You dumb fags I like to fuck you dumb hags
I like to laugh, drink, bet, and shoot scumbags
I'm just a regular bloke goin' for broke
At your jugular throat, bang it up, the blood makes you choke

[Hook]

[Outro: Chopper Read]
"I used to sell 'em their left leg
I used to say give me some money or ya see ya left leg
That leg belongs to me I'll take it with me when I'm going
Then I said if you want that left leg this is what its gonna cost ya
Ya know and I'll pull out a gun...... and aim at their kneecap"
