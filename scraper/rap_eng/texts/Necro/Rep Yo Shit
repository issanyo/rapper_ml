[Verse 1: Necro]
Yo it's Necro, Jacken and Muggs
Smacking you thugs in the face attacking you lacing you
What up nigga you can get cut up
Put up or shut up
I put my food up your ass and butt?
Pussy, don't push me I get rowdy
Violent, evil, don't doubt me
Wilin' out on you in public, fuck it you want it
You get ??? you never will forget this
Your whole head split, blood, concrete what
Why you shocked, you know why you got rocked
Pop shit and I'll pop your top
Bitch, stop acting rugged, you're not
But my clique is
PLR psycho with cypress
You not nice like this, you need work
I'll ice pick you jerk
Stick you up, jig you up, go berserk

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
I got a rugged rap city
A blunt ? up with the master weed
A little whiskey and ? in me
Your whole team ain't no match for me
Start shit, I got troops that'll blast for me
This shit is PCP, Los Angeldust, dangerous
We clique with NYC
My gang goes nuts on the semi C?
I'm killing, it ain't nothing that can end my spree
Psychologically we roam in a realm of insanity
I can't be too right in the head when I go to bed
But what the devil handed me?
My mind is stuck, I'm a sick fuck
Nothing better than some lube and a dick sucked
A quick buck, better hope you don't get cut
The name they said psychos run the street shit mad so we cliqued up

[Hook, Necro & (Sick Jacken)]

PCP (LA homie) NYC
Hit you with the AK, rep yo shit
Blast you in the dome, fall back nigga
(Where you from holmes?)
PCP (L.A homie) NYC
Hit you with the AK, rep yo shit
Blast you in the dome, fall back nigga
(Where you from homie?)

[Verse: 3]
I'm back with the murder rap and the heroin track
Formed an alliance with vintage violence and a maniac
It's called death rap, cause the bullshit fades to black
When the dust settles you get raw clips for cereals
???
Souls assassinate those, bound to a pole
Execute those when we let of
Psychologically we roam in a realm of insanity
I can't be too right in the head when I know
??? envy cause of me
It's madness, fuck around and you vanish
The savage streets a ravage beast
West to east it's no peace to the Cs
That's why the block got heat and wild out with the cannons

[Verse 3]
New York L.A. shit, real shit
Give you a razor face lift
Pure clips, lay stiff
Hit you with the Glock trey-fifth
Glitch and I'll?
Pistol pop flip you grip you ?
Shank you up for set trippin'
Blood red drippin'
Nigga you better get to steppin'
Before reppin'
Brooklyn, topico union
United chico, smack you like Nico
Above the law
Run up on you with the gun upon me
And son, you discover the floor
Try to cover your jaw from the multiple jabs
Slip through your defense, brutal intense
Cut your ventricles in intervals
With sharp tentacles, upside-down pentacles
Identical stab-wounds in your juggular
Thug it out nigga, plug the slug in ya

[Hook]
