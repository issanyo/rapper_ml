[Intro Instrumental]

Oooowww!!!
Leave you slayed in the mud
I pack a serrated blade that will leave you decapitated
Deprive your brain of oxygenated blood
Bystanders captivated, by the cadaver laid out on the floor
Splattered kid, I could dap when I clap a hater
Operator somebody just got murdered, and I heard it!
Numerous gunshots, funeral, burial plots
Use your mouth as a urinal, bury dick in your twat
I'm the Imperial, always the shit when I'm in the spot
Head you with a .40, Leave you deader than lordy
I'm Berry Gordy with a Machete, behead you like a Saudi
Dead Big and dead Pac, cowards talk shit and start drama
And then cop please after they get rocked
Caught with a 4-inch blade, laceration
Now your another corpse in storage awaiting identification
Refrigerated to delay decomposition, I'll belligerently
Break the bridge of your nasal and kitchen blade it

[Chorus]

(Slice!)
Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Smooth criminal, cuz I'm so smooth

(Verse 2)
Mortuary rap savage, East Coast Beast
Vanish a parish priest, for playing with preschool peash
Evel Knievel rapping, speaking satanic and medieval Latin
Dramatic tones, through your speaker, street sweeper clapping
Play me like I'm new fish, end up toothless, I do this
Down with caulk, full of ex-cons, like Rufus
Fuck a euphemism, my brutal truth religion
Attacks your Kufi with scissors, like a youth in prison
My hot skills not hospitable, make you a hostage
Killed in a hostile, put you in a hospital in hospice
Hot Sauce lyrics, put you in hysterics, like Derek Jeter's magical marriage
Remembered like a cleric
Autopsy technician, I drop technically perverted shit, with perfect precision
Inverted Crucifixion, my Lucifer diction murdered you, inadvertently, accidentally, you got burnt to the third degree!

[Chorus]

(Fire!)
Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Smooth criminal, cuz I'm so smooth

Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with
The Beast theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Cool, cuz I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Smooth criminal, cuz I'm so smooth

[Instrumental]

Cuz I'm so smooth
