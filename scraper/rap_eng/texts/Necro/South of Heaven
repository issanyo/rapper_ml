[Necro]
I'm carvin' a carcass, I'm a starving artist
Like Emerson, Lake and Palmer when they recorded Tarkus
I'm a commando, knocking you out like Fernando Vargas
Similar to Brando in Apocalypse
I’ll burn you like the eyes of Cyclops when he drops his shades
You can't stop the blades
You get crushed like you're in the back of a garbage truck...
Now ya' just cartilage
Mushed like the Battle of Carthage, my archers bring carnage
Upon my arch enemies sacrifice like a Partridge
Calico cartridges are a God's gift
During beef, with 15 cats where 16 caps wouldn't do it
I need at least 150 rounds to lay them all down dead forever
Exposing their red fluid
Boxes of bullets for coppers and oxes, obnoxious
Rockin' a wool rich Arctic jacket with a doo rag over my optics
Ratchet, Glock cocked, ready for action
Like Segal force you to pop lock till you fracture your bones, I manufacture
The dopest narcotics to hit since crack hit the streets
In capsules a few years after Blondie's "Rapture."

[Hook: Necro]
The flow is South of Heaven
Satanic underground, death metal rap, progressive verbal shredding
South of Heaven
Street shit, you know the steelo
I'll be stabbing you in the jugular vein of your neck
Like Pesci in the beginning of Casino

[Mr. Hyde]
I got a bad blood fetish, split open your lettuce
And bust through your whole crew like Jerome Bettis
The police dread us, we're sick and elusive
Then put massacres on the channel 2 news clip
Don't you slip, the tyrants are waiting
For your downfall, to shove eighty blades in
Straight up degrading, spittin' the hardest
Shit you ever heard turned you into a carcass
Marksmen's hand-guns clicking at random
Empty out a clip then dip like a phantom
The circle of serpents villains you worship
We're hexing the Earth with curses and verses
Ain't no stopping the doctrine of death
I'm shocking like rocking an ox in your neck
On the prowl stalkin', patiently hawkin'
Sittin' on your couch waitin' for you to walk in
Ambush attack with an axe in your back
Drippin' red like a strawberry daiquiri, black
I'll carve my name in a slain victim
Sluts I abduct, get fucked, and drip cum
Change up the flow, kill every ho slow
I hang around death like Brandon Lee's Crow
The tyrants taint your headsets with death
Bleed CD's and rape your tape decks

[Hook]

[Goretex]
Industrial sludge, thuggin' for goons
Buggin' out my jail bitches stash and blastin' shrooms
Acid too, dipped up juice from caskets
Then I rock the venison mask catch 2 in your basket
Reign in blood, the reason we take drugs, the reason we rape nuns
Medinah stay caked up, we laced up
Young pig tails clipped for purchase
Calling Fenriz, now we setting fire to churches
Earth-less, stay up in the telly with nurses
My verse will reconstruct the face tissue on virgins
You know you heard of us, hit the cranium
I'm just a quiet kid, brick to ya' uranium
I see the haters in, faggot knapsacks
Keep it real, '85 Exodus back patch
Glenwood reps it, Howie with crack packs
All eyes on me, turned fitteds to flap-jacks
Marinate let the crack settle with rebels
Satan get behind the money this is Black Metal
The young wizard behind the wall of sleep
Whatever my dreams, my mind's playin' tricks on me
I'm mad homie
These chicks wanna piss on me
Stuffin' pills in my mouth, tie me up and kiss the beast
Suicide Girls throwin' tit to me, it's infamy
Ain’t no mystery, it’s misery, hit the symphony

[Hook]
