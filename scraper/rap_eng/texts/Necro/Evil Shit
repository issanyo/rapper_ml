This be some evil shit to inspire you to start a fire
Do something illegal, only thing you require is a wire to strangle someone
Let out your anger son, buildin' up, you're filled up with pain and anguish
Kid do you understand my insane language?
SENSELESS, violence, psychology, apprentices of sickness learnin' the art of WHILIN', and robbery with demented instincts
Cemented in your mental is the exceptional fact that feeling sentimental for humans is detrimental
I'm experimental in the ways of murderin' you herbs and turds with absurd words and verbs
Would you have preferred being lured into a crucifixion scenario, where you're eaten by birds?
The impresario--of rude convictions--describing
Crude descriptions
Prescribing murder through scribes, and desecrate the bible's vibes
Maggots crawling on this page as I write this rap
It's amazing, appalling, I think Satan's calling, I might snap

(Hook)
Rap, stab, flesh, Jux, quick then grab your neck
Bludgeon you bloody yo buddy, you stupid? What's after death?
Psychological with the demonic pull, reelin' you into sin peelin' your skin like a psychotic bull

God won't protect your existence, so I don't respect your religion
Visually you reflect a pigeon, this'll be dissected by traffic
Graphic violence the science of a bloodbath is mathematic multiplying of catastrophic dying of vinyl plastic
Or a CD, mastered, you can't answer whether I'm making sense or not or imitating Manson
Preaching the end of God is my mantra. Enter the pod, take a trip into the nucleus of gore where the center is scarred
You'll catch a barbarian beating by convicted thugs
Left in the sanitarium, eating prescription drugs
Force me to brutalize you, demonstrate to you how I utilize a butcher knife to computerize your flesh, pixelate you
Triple six degrade you. You can't quarantine the therapeutic Thorazine forever putrid horror scenes
That sick cleverly secluded in the origin of this cerebrum deep-rooted info for the coroner team

(Hook)
Rap, stab, flesh, Jux, quick then grab your neck
Bludgeon you bloody yo buddy, you stupid? What's after death?
Psychological with the demonic pull, reelin' you into sin peelin' your skin like a psychotic bull
