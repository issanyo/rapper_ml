MURDER YOUR LIFE

Stab in your face with a butcher knife that's really long
I'll make you feel this song
When I beat you down to it, I don't care if I appear wrong kid as I do it
I represent the death rap get your head cracked open
Till we stare at your brain, I don't care if you think I'm insane
'cause I take respect this serious, so if you disrespect you're an idiot
Stick an ice pick in your neck, till you bleed like a period
Damn me kid fam me kid
And if you don't, you will when I put fear in you bitch
Bring it to you violently, silently
Walk up to you, you have no idea it's me
Rock in a mask, poppin you fast
With a Glock with a silencer
When you die ya'll see
Necro the sicko
Let go of my jacket you faggot let death blow
Die like a man if you can but you can't so you won't
'cause you're a male ho
Yo I run this shit, put guns to your tits
Blast milk all over your cereal
Run your shit your clothes your shoes and if you refuse
Get your ass killed all over material
Brutal sadistic the only way to rip shit
Im'a stay cryptic till the end of time
The only day you'll be doper than me with a rhyme
Is when I quit dip-shit, it'll never go down like that
I'll still be around, from the ground I'll rap
As a corpse the verse that's striving to tell
All demons on earth how to survive in hell

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy

Chopping you up you fags, and dropping you in a garbage bag
Off of a bridge, had every ligament frozen in a fridge keeping it fresh
And it's all for the kids, beat you to death
Stomping your grill with combat boots
You fag get fucked, get murdered militantly to the best of my ability
I'm gonna stay grotesque, no rest for the wicked, circle the tyrant
Circulation of the virus, a perverted nation of violence
I converted pagans to commit my sins
I'm a choke you with the pen I write with
Get ready for the insertion, excursion
Through your jugular poisoning your blood
You were a death virgin, now you got fucked
For the first time in you life you're dead
How you like it? Can't come back ever again
You better get used to it, and make the devil your friend
Psycho-logical where it's logical to be a psycho
Astronomical with a rifle blasting at you if your ass is comical

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
