[Hook: Kool G Rap]
Trigga for hire, criminal retire
Hoody with the mask on given em the fire
Blood from out the jugular vein, slit it with wire
Heat your head like the bitch under the dryer
It’s ready aim soon as one of you bitches try us
The smarter day murder ain't trigger for hire
Fuck Billboard Kid got hits like shania
Buck shots to cell blocks Sphinx you get expired

[Verse 1: Necro]
Sharp shooter with a futuristic car computer
Catch a goon
Baracuda
With a biscuit harpoon
Then spark buddah
Smartass get blown apart fast
End up a sarcastic bastard in a casket
Your dome in a shopping cart basket
Wrap your heart in plastic
Clap your retarded spastic
Partner blast her Dolly Parten tits
Em covered and master-bate
Your not relevant
The elephants in the room
I’ll make you look like the elephant man
Gelatin
Pop your melon millitantly
Then catch brains from Penelope Cruz
Got a gallop and a macalicle phallus
All up in these whoores
Triple 6 with the icepick
Nice with the crime
A precise mix of Tyson
And Vincent Price in his prime
Ya diced like bison
You’ll see Christ pale white like mime
Iceman with the crossbow of Death!
Boy we catch you at the right time
Wiser than prime minister Winston Churchill
Hurt(ch) you like Virgil Earp
You’ll burp blood
If you chirp
Leave you deep purple

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Spit what bars? Yes par, we bar spit Escobar
Bless yall with extra bars, y'all bars lesser bars
Who would invest in yall?
Somebody S the chest a yall
Must of been Lion King next to Scar
My spit game the same level where the wild west sketches are
I send theft off to the park where the sessions are
Into there into there, exit part through his kevlar
Left a mark where you press your star
Through the whore from the rear
Through her chair
To somewhere where the front desk(es) are
Through a brick wall
Then where the parked lexus car
I wish death to yall
Lay on tar where the sketches are
Eyes with the x's
Mark 5 in your precious hearts
Rest hard on EMS stretcher carts
The rest of yall should dress in bras
That’s your repertoire
Walk it up you seek territory where S the czar
Represent glory your piss poor where your asked to flaunt
I’m hard to Peel
Get your flesh a scar
Hard as a burnt shish kebab
Like Texas bar and barbecue grill
Get left with impression marks
Rappers are refresheners
You get aired out
My mob is too real
On the ironside
My iron on the side
Raw like a lion pride
Spar with two steels
Like Saving Private Ryan
Guys if you ain't Michael Ironside
I’m a make ridin hard with two wheels
Ya feel

[Hook]
