[Hook: Necro]
Revenge
Revenge
Revenge
I need some get back I'm mad, you're gonna bleed bad

[Verse 1: Necro]
Snap the joint to your arm, stab an artery
Make your neck leak, 5 point palm exploding heart technique
Merciless, like Paul Kirsty, thirsty, for retribution, 38 bursting
A desire burning, like gasoline fire yearning the murder like the Colin from Wire
No negotiation, you won't know it's coming, no association, incrimination
Just tribulation break in your crib brought, reciprocation, aluminum to your fibula
Pull the trigger biblically bring it to your siblings, equipped to be vindictive
Carrying a shotgun, wearing a scary costume, I'll get at you like Harry Osbourne
Scope you, peepin' you, surveillance, bring back balance, value, like young valance
From gangs in New York seeking revenge for his fathers death, dead rabbits trap
Hit you with hollow tips, like a shallow flick, side-step the laws and legal politics
Rock in disguises, doctors outfits, Glocks cocked or not, you shit in your trousers
Crucify, I'm gruesome, like Medusa, do you believe in Jesus? I'll introduce you!

[Chorus: Necro]
Revenge
I need some, get back I'm mad, you'll end up dead for that
Revenge
I need some, get back I'm mad, you're gonna bleed bad
Revenge
I need some, get back I'm mad, you'll end up dead for that
Revenge
I need some, get back I'm mad, you're gonna bleed bad

[Verse 2: Necro]
Hit em hard, hit em fast, like chopper said, pop you in the head, drop you, then bop ahead
Walk away, camouflaged, by the night, like I'm a guard, snipe you with you entourage
The mission is to be in a position to strike, cold, calculated and efficient
Carefully, meticulous financially, you'll wish you never crossed me to begin with, BITCH
You better jet, you facing a real predator, with a Beretta, with a vendetta like Perrette
Never forget, like an elephant, dwell upon the fact you'll get your melon split
Some Makaveli shit, i relish it, you disabled, and delicate, unable to flip
Bust you completely, you can't beat me, rush you, treat you worse than feces

[Chorus]
