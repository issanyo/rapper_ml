[Chorus: Brian Fair]
Listen to the Death Rap, Metal Hiphop, start a pit
The most hardcore shit you ever heard, kid
We'll kill you, if you ever disrespect
Paid mad dues, die for the rep
Straight from the heart, bleed from the soul
I'm ambitious and determined with goals
To murder verbally, you'll get scarred in a battle
Ya suffocated to death by God's shadow
Kill it!

[Verse 1:]
Brutal, Death Rap, cuttin flesh, severed limbs, murder you, massacre, the master of malevolence
Destiny to kill, fill ya body up with holes
Bullets from a shottie, aim it, pull it, gently, demented, the goal
Chop you into shreds, behead you, then bury you, forget you, let you rot, it's necessary take a shit up on your plot
Very foul, stab ya bowels up with a kitchen knife
Guitar triplets like a gallop
Cut you like a scallop in a salad
Destroy you, demonically, sonically, anarchy like Anakin in agony seeking revenge for his family
Mike Smith, blast beats, grind, trife shit, rip ya tongue out with a vice-grip, quick kid I'm nice with it
Slaughtering every fucking recording
I'm an out of order marauder, bucking the .44 mag at ya quarters
Where you be livin', givin' orders to my demons to deliver you dead or alive, we're driven by evil, the unforgiven

[Chorus: Brian Fair]
Listen to the Death Rap, Metal Hiphop, start a pit
The most hardcore shit you ever heard, kid
We'll kill you, if you ever disrespect
Paid mad dues, die for the rep
Straight from the heart, bleed from the soul
I'm ambitious and determined with goals
To murder verbally, you'll get scarred in a battle
Ya suffocated to death by God's shadow
Again!

[Verse 2:]
Second verse, gets worse
Left in a hearse, dead first, wrecked, your head bursts, the blood in ya neck squirts
Pit rap, penetrate brain, generate pain, innovate, push ya shit back, create the insane
Artistically, sadistically, statistically, realistically, pistol whip thee
Goregrind gangster, glorifying you dying, graphically, gripping the 4-pound banger
Nuclear blast you
Gasoline light you, caste you in flames, ignite you, demean you, surpass you
Death is past due, harass you, fight you, faster than Mark Gastineau when I chastise you
Improvising, lyrically mesmerizing, terrible terrorizer, enterprising
Like Verizon, my vocal vernacular, pokes ya jugular, like Stoker's Dracula

[Verse 3:]
Start a mosh pit, start beef and don't squash it, obnoxious
Cold like ya frost bit, like you lost it
Bold, flippin' out, aggressively pushing, like wrestling
Mush you, you're soft like a cushion, blood dripping out
Slam into each other, crammed into a club like salmon in a can, if there's drama stand with your brother
Stage diving in a rage live in the flesh, fights to death in a steel cage surviving
The most demented dance ever invented, gives you a chance to vent out your pent up contempt kid
Circle pits, wall of death, Braveheart, jerk ya fists, berserk, brawling upset, rep to the graveyard
Peep the breakdown, headbanging, long hair hanging, short hair, bald
Who cares? as long as you get angry
Metal, hardcore, punk, faster and heavier, who created it? You could debate it, it's trivia

[Chorus: Brain Fair & Necro x2]
