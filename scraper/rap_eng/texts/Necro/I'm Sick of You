Yeah yo, all you bitch ass niggas shady motherfuckers

[Hook]
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
What? I'm sick of you {*scratching*}

[Verse 1]
I'm sick of you I need robitussin, don't make me start bustin
You so depressed, you can't let me enjoy a minute
You make me sick, like I ate food with poison in it
You played out, you're too repetitive
Give me a sedative before my brain gets negative
And I get the fever for the flavour of a shankin
Right in your throat G, cause on your bullshit I've OD'd
I've had it! You lying in the habit like a teenager in tablets
Likie carrots and rabbits, automatics and religious fanatics

[Hook]
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
Fucking bitch.. I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
Pass me the Excederin before I bash your fuckin head in

[Verse 2]
I ain't feelin you
The only thing I feel's an allergic reaction
Pass the medication, you got me sick like a patient
Digestin your weak conversation
Shut the fuck up cause I'm not patient
But I'm mental, you might catch laceration
Wanna be hard rock, STOP, play at your age
I'm sick from you pussies; like I fucked y'all and you had AIDS
My stomach feelin obscure, the only cure is a knife into your dick
Suck enjoy it, stop you from rappin cause your style's poor

[Hook]
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
Pass me an Advil before I make you travel below some gravel

[Verse 3]
I get nauseated, from a DJ with a wack playlist
And court for six hours of lookin at his dickhead baliff
Criminal court is like a virus clinic, cause I'm sick
Once I'm in it, the disease called annoyin grows each minute
Go get your own style, you ain't sick enough
Yo I got a headache son, cause you're suckin my dick too much
And that's the only way shit like you will grow up
My acid lunch, eat you up, you make you wanna throw up

[Hook]
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
I'm sick of you {*scratching*}
Hand me a Bufferin before you catch a fuckin snuffin

Bitch! I'm fuckin sick of you!
Fuckin bitch-ass motherfuckers, shady sluts!
WHAT!
