[Verse 1]
I seen a bitch named gutter slut talking to a paraplegic about violence
Then threw his wheelchair into the fire pit
Nihilist becomes entombed, xecutioner becomes obituary
Birth the kings of doom
Earth becomes Black Sabbath, turn Ozzy to Dio
Surgeons fuck that plastic turn Cosby to Theo
Jody Foster's army missed Reagan
James Brady got sprayed quick fast like he played for sadus
Nuns have no fun, homie, ask Melissa
Don't break the oath, you'll be tortured by shadows that whisper
Satisfaction is the death of desire
My perseverance lead to the rise of supremacy
The quest for fire
Inventing the wheel, re-inventing the steel, killswitch, a fixation on darkness
Perception is real, take as needed for pain, lack of almost everything
Slap a ham, half a gram of dope is so heavy, dig?

[Hook]
The mind is the most dangerous weapon alive
Spin doctors operate behind enemy lines
Mind control, something you could potentially buy
The new holy war has arrived, you ready to die?

[Verse 2]
You're a powerslave, somewhere in time, piece of mind
Keeper of the 7 keys in seven churches arrive
Under the sign of the black mark, to mega therion
Under lock and key, tooth and nail, hellion
From the ashes of hellhammer, morbid tales
No one ever really wanna buy peace, war prevails
Shout at the devil, dogs of war bark at the moon
The mob rules, heaven and hell, it's up to y'all, choose
From enslavement to obliteration, youth of today are sick of it all
In a warzone where pistols are god screaming out "lights, camera, revolution"
From the wonderful folks who brought you Iraq, here's the new execution
The malfunction, the regulator, the re-ignition
The fearless vampire killers on a mission
People crazy enough to think that they can change the world, do it
Kick down the motherfucking door and walk through it

[Hook]
