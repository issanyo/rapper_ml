[Intro]
Yo, yo, this is it right here (this is it)
It's a new day (new day)
A new time, a new era
Psycho+Logical forever
Uncle Howie forever
This is the time to get ourselves together (get it together people)
Organize around this shit right here (right here)
This is how it go down, yo

[Hook]
All my people getting rich let's, organize
Gangs, from bloods to crips let's, organize
All folks to the kids let's, organize
Organize means freedom, hear what I'm speaking
To the true, to selling drugs let's, organize
From the students, to the thugs let's organize
All my brothers in the clubs let's, organize
Organize means freedom, freedom, freedom

[Verse 1]
First install in yourself, why you're here, Earth's surface
From the birth to end of hurt, what's your worth and your purpose?
Is you worth to your work, what's your goals and aspirations
Is you aggressive or passive, or do you hold your patience?
This whole nation built on lies, blatantly killing minds
War cost billions, poor childrens is traumatised
We don't own our lives off the womb compromised, cause
If I do, that means that I'll be conqured out and lost, fuck that
I built for combat, for where the bare arms at
From my enemies with my comrades, beyond that
Stand for something, if not, fall for anything
Organize is key of being free, can offer many things
See? That's why the military so powerful
But I'ma get my army together like Colonel Palmer do
Identify causes because it's essential
Stop the playing [?] let the fighting continue

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The whole school system sucks, it ain't halfway decent
Dropout rates increasing 'cause the way they be teaching
The streets been teaching us lessons for years
But we became more concerned, we're just impressing our peers
I'm testing you here, to see, if you wanna be part
Of this method to use our streets smart and take over these retards
We start first, knowing how the system works
Educate ourselves and stay out of the prisons and church
We work to be mentally and physically strong and healthy
Realize there's nothing wrong with being wealthy
Now tell me you don't wanna be rich, come on, dog
Well, if you wanna be rich then stop being a bitch and wake up
You fake fuck, take off your mask and make-up
The stakes up, team find new ways to stay up
Fuck my temper, just remember what I told you:
Control your enemy, don't let your enemy control you!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Psycho+Logical, Uncle Howie, organize
Necro, Non Phixion, organize
All my peoples in the place let's, organize
Organize means freedom, hear what I'm speaking
