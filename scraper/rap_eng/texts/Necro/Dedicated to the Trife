Check this Hustler shit out
This is for all you fucking gangster niggas out there...
There aaaaaall dedicated to the trife shit

This is for the kids on the corners with beepers and bangers
And low shirts on hangers Loot and Timberland boots
Honeys that want to go clubbing or should I say 'Rubbing'
Up against Mack Daddies that drive black Caddies
And white Continentals blasting my instrumentals
Trunks, filled with blasting instruments like 'Biscuits'
BMW's driven by hoodlums that will trouble you
If you don't let them hustle you, they'll snuff you
Cops will cuff you for no reason
Herbs are open season
Your man's committing treason cause your girl is skeezing
This is for the hard rocks that pack Glocks
Swinging batteries in socks eating daiquiris and locks
For niggas that box and hit the bag cellular phones and herringbones
Rings with large stones holmes and weapons galore
Like the  double bladed knife inside my pocket
This is dedicated to the trife

Dedicated to the Trife
Dedicated to the Trife kid
I'm sexing your wife, kid
Put the trife on
This is dedicated to the Trife with the butcher knife

Dedicated to the fucking Trife
Dedicated to the Trife, kid
I'm sexing your wife, kid
Put the trife on
This is dedicated to the Trife with the butcher knife - for the trife

For the girls with big butts and kids with big guts
And HEARTS and honeys that dress up Friday night to meet me
And treat me with respect. I'm kicking this rhyme for crime
And kids that sell dimes but don't drop 'em
For thugs that rot, shot the thugs that got pistols for sale
Selling more crystals than Gale
Tough guys that snuff guys for looking
Get arrested and spend the whole night in central booking
From Brooklyn to Manhattan
To Bronx to Queens
To Shaolin and Strong Island
Violently I get fucking greens
Fill the head with cash and flip hash
And got a stash of loot that's trife
God bless your life

(Chorus)
