[Verse 1: Necro]
Yo, you're monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher juxing your head
Cripplin, crimy, criminal, grimy, gory, terrible, tyrannical, try me
Mechanically murderous, I'm uncanny
My gun keeps me company, my companion
Click clack, cock it, aim it, blast it
Bastard, you ain't the fastest to dodge it
Cold and soggy, you need law enforcement
You soft like [?] and margerine
Kid, your squadron is [?]
You need guardians, pray to God for them
Death rap, [???]
The most brutalest, the most sadistic
Hazardous like an overdose of acid hits

[Hook x2: Ill Bill]
Splatterfest, sadomasochist, murder world
Take it in blood!
Like the word of God telling me to kill

[Verse 2: Mr Hyde]
I'm carnivorous, swerved and disturbed
Slashing your throat until your word slurbed
Spill from your cuts, bloods, guts and fluid
Injecting streams of worst sewage
Hacking away, my fourth [?] is slayed
Now quick torturous endulging foreplay
No resting, nesting, molesting, infesting
Your death's the best thing
Fuck your thugs, my gun sprays slugs
You're running, buddy you won't escape from us
Scalpels cut ya, flesh gets ruptured
Slaughtering got ya, organized structure
Buck ya'll with the nine millimeter heater
Leave you dead in the back of the two seater
Gat to your mind, axe throught your spine
Equals the end you're flat to a line

[Hook x2]
