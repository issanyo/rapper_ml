[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
Someone fronts, I'm quick to check 'em
Like I'm crackin bricks when I'm wreckin
Flurries of punches, six per second, kicks like Beckham
I'm a gifted individual, you riff and I'll split your skull
Like it's nothing, I'm indifferent like a pitbull to beef and brawls
Ain't difficult to lift you off your pivotal position
Leave you stiff in a hole, then spark the piff in a bowl
Use a Bowie knife to kill fags like David Bowie
Enslavin Zo Kravitz and make her blow me in a lavatory
Heaven or the devil, sever you with a shovel lever
Stop you from doin anything you ever endeavor again forever
Pull no punches, my punches'll pull you to the ground
Like a full set of lunges
Get the guns and plunge bullets into your crown
Like one of the founders of Grunge
He ate a shotgun round and was found hunched, out to lunch
Never trust it, the American legal system sucks
I'll find justice when my Desert Eagle biscuit bucks

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
Fellas are sloppy, Mack G Rap, the black El Mariachi
The black ( ? ) hot bitch, bad foxy
The tat Bella Mafi', Mac shells in the lobby
Drug dealer shootouts, dime divas screwed out
My nine squeezers move out, the hairpin trigger type
Rich goons light up a dark room with icicle light
Both wrists lit up like Lite-Brite, rollin triple dice
Palms with callused skin
One in the head for this Wonder Bread
From Wonderland, same place that Alice in
Style of the wildest men, loaded gats make 'em Kojaks
Silly Mac millie, Telly Savalas-in men
Fingernail file in your brim, we let the malice begin
We holdin trial in the trenches, Cannonball calibers spin
Necro, you follow?, KGR, the skets blow the hollows
All the pretty women can blow and swallow
Far from your role model, crooks roll with the same role as Rollo
Plaid apparel, double barrels to follow
Hey, the 45 Colt chew 'em like horse hay
Saw a play, the way I sent Bullets Over his Broad's way
Bag of plastic, I pull it over your dork face

We pop slugs in your cranium
