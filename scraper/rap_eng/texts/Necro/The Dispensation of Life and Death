[Intro: Charles Manson]
Do you want me to be the guy you're trying to make me? Do you want me to be the guy that orders people to die? Do you want me to be dispensation of life and death? You convicted me for dispensating life and death, man. The (fucking) President of the United States can't even do that!

[Verse 1: Necro]
Nothing like a dead pastor splattered all over concrete like plaster
On Sabbath; a blasphemist disaster
I provide you with intricate, sadistic shit to guide you
But diss the clique and we'll divide you like arithmetic
Riding with the pistol grips
Sliding down low inconspicuous when I slide in the biscuit clip
Buck at you; release until I'm bullets inside you bitch
And if you're in a car we'll pull up to the side of it
You know the rest: the pressure hurts
Bucked in your chest again; you'll be using your best efforts
Tucking your intestines in like dress shirts
A professional hit; you're fucked like molested kids in church
We're cave beings; we crave seeing death like Arabians
Stabbing your flesh like Linda Kasabian
Numerous punctures
It's humorous how a human crumbles when juxed; that's how the universe functions

[Hook: Necro]
You'll live as long as I let you (You owe me your life)
You'll die as soon as I give the order to dead you (Kill 'em)
Life and death the fact's it'll always get you (Remember)
Knife and techs the tools use to affect you

You'll live as long as I let you (You owe me your life)
You'll die as soon as I give the order to dead you (Kill 'em)
Life and death the fact's it'll always get you (Remember)

[Verse 2: Necro]
I have the ability to mentally detach myself from emotion
And the agility to dementedly slash your flesh with a motion
During a commotion what's occurring is promotion
When I crack you in public all you see is the blur of an explosion
I'm pure corrosion of conformity; I love deformity
Like sliced faces from shrapnel in the bunkers of Normandy
I observe you as nonexistent; the nerve of you to think you're sadistic
You're an assistant, a pissant
An unrealistic a bitch-ass you kiss-ass
A dumb cystic fibrosis spaz that shits in his pants
If you see a stranger stabbing a stranger
Don't get involved, that shit'll get stranger
When you're in danger of your life being taken
Over something that wasn't a major concern of yours
Now you're in surgery cause an artery got cut with a razor
You played yourself you walk your line in life, don't go batty
This rap I kick is deep like the shit Manson told Patty

[Bridge: Charles Manson]
She can think pink elephants until mama Africa comes home and it still doesn't make elephants pink

I don't even know who Candice Bergen is, that's how dumb I am. I'm really dumb. You wouldn't believe how stupid I am; I'm a hillbilly

The dispensation of life and death

[Hook]

[Outro: Charles Manson]
The dispensation of life and death
The dispensation of life and death
