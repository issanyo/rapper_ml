The death penalty, it's nothing new. It's been with us for centurys we've buried
People alive lobbed off their heads burned them alive in public square gruesome
In this century we kept searching for more and more humane ways of killing people
That we didn't like Shot fire at them suffocated them gas chamber
But now, now we have developed a device that is the most humane of all

Welcome to your new home Mr. Hyde. You'll be served 3 meals a day
You'll only be let out of your cell once within a 24 hour period
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

[Mr. Hyde]
Yeah, I understand

[Sabac]
Do you have any questions?

[Mr. Hyde]
Yea I got a question. When do I meet the devil?

[Sabac]
I've been guardin this piece of shit for the last 5 years
I can't what to see him fry cry and die in his tears
He looks numb like a bum as he sits in his cell
Tellin stories bout his life and the victim's he's killed
One arrest over 40 deaths who would've thought it?
Tons of corpses with no remorse efficiantly tortured
Better kneel down pray you ain't going to hell
You gonna die soon now what you gotta say to yourself?

[Mr. Hyde]
Death row I'm looking strait forward to my execution
As I await to bake and meet my fatal execution
Strait death solution no chance of me in rehab
Just a one way trip on the electric LSD tab
I'd rather get the needle but I guess I'll fry today
Definatly get repayed know I guess I'd better pray
47 slaughters without an apprehention
But nothing lasts forever even demon intervention
As he said the last prayer the priest was holdin back a tear
I can sense he felt the presence of the devil's atmosphere
I felt the maggots near as they strapped me in the chair
Execution I grin like he was happy I was scared
I thought about the murders and smiled back at the cunts
They can't even discover cuz they can only kill me once
I searched deep in my heart but remorse was never found
I stared the reaper in his eyes as he pulled the lever down
The shocks flew to my brain but I'm immune to the pain
Satans will is stronger but it flew to my veins
As I breath the rooms spinnin my breath was growing thin
Death is settin in as hell eternity begins

[Sabac]
As I taped up his eyes and mouth and covered his ears
I swear I didn't sense an ounce of worry or fear
It was clear for his capture his confession was less then
Regretful the man had an obsession with death
It probably stems from neglect being abused as a child
And as a man he lashed out those are rules to the cycle
Executing dehumanist sick the sight is frightening
To think in the world there's someone out there just like him

Dead man, Dead man walking. Dead man, dead man walking. Dead man walking here
Dead man. We got a dead man walking here. Dead man walking
