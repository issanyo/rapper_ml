[Verse 1]
Yeah my mafia's like a posse of ya soldiers trooping through Bosnia
Body ya; To bury ya with a hundred bodies on top of ya
Your life's expired, you're on the floor dead with ya' arms out like ya tired
My shit's crazy like animals spreading rabies and dead babies
And bodies wrapped in plastic, etrocities like these are drastic
Cut you open, shoved a spike in ya liver, your veins are like a river
Blood flowing through veins like roads on a map
Open the hole..back of ya brain
Perform surgery while you're asleep
There's no difference between you and sheep
You're dead meat, get your throat cut to the beat
Machinery dragging you by ya feet
If ya hungry you're dying to eat
Choking on Alpo with a scalpel in your adam's apple
And a calico slug in your asshole
I'll put you in a chapel
Kid you should be careful fucking with a butcher knife
Pack of that will butcher you like a jackal

[Chorus]
You disrepect me - You're All Fuckin Dying!
It wasn't your fault, well - You're All Fuckin Dying!
You's the one that did it, well - You're All Fuckin Dying!
My feelings get hurt - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Sometime in ya life - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Every human that's living now - You're All Fuckin Dying!
In 10 years or 30 years - You're All Fuckin Dying!
When the nuclear war comes - You're All Fuckin Dying!

[Verse 2]
I'm the most hard fire type
The rapper to write raps
That be glorifying knives and pipes and spiked bats
I'll light you up like fire-flies in the night
You might get left scarred for life a spike
Be happy you haven't died yet
The Death Rhymer preying on you soft hip hop heads
Leave you dead and decaying like a corpse
Ready fearing anguish through my severe language
Once you hear the ampage ya ears'll need to be bandaged
Death is my territory every story's infested
With skeletons at a very glorious distant
That's why moms had to give birth to me
So I could hit up the earth with a purpose
To spit a verse that's gloomy
This beat is kinda like a meat grinder
Chopping you quick to kick dogs like a killer walking behind ya
It ain't gossip spreading it's logic
That Necro's the most gothic in Gotham
Dead in ya project, so fuck ya block kid
You're like a possum that's being hunted and shocked
'cause a bullet in ya head is the object

[Chorus]
One of you pisses me off - You're All Fuckin Dying!
I don't care If I'm cool with you - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Every healthy human being - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Every second gets older - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Open up the safe or - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Or make a run for the door - You're All Fuckin Dying!
Talk to someone in my click - You're All Fuckin Dying!
You beat me down and let me live - You're All Fuckin Dying!

You're All Fuckin Dying!
Ain't no one exempt!
For fuckin' contempt!
Know your fuckin' place
Fuckin' hookers
PSYCHO + LOGICAL RECORDS
Put you in your fuckin' casket
Bitches
That's right
