[Verse]
Look threw the hole of a bottle cap
Foggy like the message given in mainstream rap
They get this and that
And your money originally saved up for their new hat
I'm Childish not like Gambino
Reading cat in the hat books in a speedo
No different then you watching your favorite tv show
Walking Dead corpses
'Round without a head
I don't get head I get neck
Precision shit great
I spit my shit from the neck up
When bitches see me they neck up
Red rings dirtier than dirt
It's ironic it's in a bathroom
Then i wonder why isn't the console in the living room
Holding an ak in reverse
Black converse
Your mistress on my hit list
One hit, white tracing using chalk
Hard to miss this like neon colored shoes on a cyclist
Got art shit
Secluded like titties and graffiti under a boardwalk
Get featured then off red rings
Think 'bout how many emeralds you need need to be considered a king
Flightless birds are the underdogs
No literally
Articles bout Bieber for a quick buck
Only one gets famous of 25 Bucks
And why can a white dude wear a bandanna
And no one cares
Because he's a motorcyclist
But when a black dude does it
He gets shot down inequality
I'm aquatic like dolphins be
Despite my comments on hating water
It doesn't affect me
It's crazy how we started at vcr to an mp
And hows someone gon' rest in peace
When their body decays
And they weren't a hippy
See look into the sea
Get your third eye out
Confused I know
Like your vision magically turned into a kaleidoscope

[Outro]
Sorry, I'm lazy
