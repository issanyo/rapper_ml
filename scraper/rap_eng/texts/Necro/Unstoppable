I put the motherfucking gangsta in the game
Destroy you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you wanna turn the other way
Stick yo fucking head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beeming on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene looking like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in your mouth
Dont ever let the kid joe take a shit in your house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to their husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobody's fault, its all good as long as nobody's caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
Won't stop till I put Uncle Howie in forbes

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowing the spot, bill was running the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in your face
Look at me now, Non-Phixion running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea Ill punch you in your face when Im out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitted they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Calling for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
Fuck wit me, I'm a see you in hell
So don't fuck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stopping the unstoppable

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

I found your lack of faith disturbing, now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders, these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the business plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
Fuck taking over answer, kidnap the family and hold em for ransom
We getting dough ya'll, its the jump off
Either you get with us or fuck off
An unstoppable force on a rough course
Big success, fuck with me you fucking wit the best
Fuck who's on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them

No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
