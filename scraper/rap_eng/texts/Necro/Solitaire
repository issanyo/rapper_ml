Sition,  chillen in prison for havin been the illest

Villain doin dealings the specifics of which you can en-

Vision so I'm sittin wrist watching the drip drop of the

Tick tock it hollows out my rock until there's water in my

Socks it doesn't stop (it never stops) until it's flowing out the

Bottom from the top I'll never drop , unless I'm being

Lowered six feet inside a box which reminds me when the

Week is over my noggin is gettin shot death rows my

Spot bodily autonomy is not respected by despots do I deserve to live the jury's verdict is In

, guess not for all the crimes Ive committed quite a

Lot I've earned to right to have my mind wipes of dirty thoughts

, Ostracized By life livin inside of a

Lock I lost the key alongside my pride long stride and

Smile below my eyes no longer carryin the fire down the

Road two days away my dome explodes and opens up like center

Folds, cold soul floats and fills the moldy mold of

Moaning ghost Boastin hostin chains weighing way more than

Jacobs the name of my cell Mate with basically the same

Fate incarcerated for rapin an strangling a dame

, plainly deranged an so I say " hey

Jake who's to blame for your behavior an the pain that came

Later for mistakes made by a waveslave craze wasted

Fake faced chase craver,,, was your Slate painted

Hastily by knaves maybe raised in the shade with snake

Neighbors playing with your Clay in the rain  it's taken shape

, now you're bathing in the flames changes saved

Vague statements engraved inside of your brain gaze behind a

Stained pane tainted by pain, placed into

Grave awake remains you became Jake locate

Weights of Blame, scales dictate who

Stays who hangs who's safe and who's slain



Your

Question is detestable,  mentionin perspective you'd ex-

Pect to detect second guessing, but I suppose you know the

Right direction, also suspect you're unrespectable

Bet that your integrity is flexible like wrestling with

Vegetables, you're indefensibly dispensable pro-

Jections reprehensible most likely unintentional self

Deceptin is plentiful, I'm collectible and

Soon you'll see that testing me's regrettable messing with a pro

Ffesional, yes I roughed up and snuffed that dumb

Slut so what bitch you front like you ain't done some fucked

Up stuff you just bluffin I know you was throat cuttin

, for fun or next to nothing you became a bun in satans

Oven is there hope for those in hell locate the Windows our

Cheatin so I ceased her breathin until she was almost freezin

Now I'm tweaking Body reekin preceding proceedings where the

People see the reason, me
