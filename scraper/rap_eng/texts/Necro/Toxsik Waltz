[Necro]
You better bite your tongue, cuz if not you'll fight a gun
My raps are street like a bum, I write scum
Corner raps, you caught a crack in your skull
Tryin' to talk back to the quarterback
I call shots, I sold pot to old twats
I ran through different blocks like I had no pops
I get vexed, attack your headset, kid you're dead next
You ain't sick, you won't flip
I don't trip, I don't get pimped
I got ownership of all of my own shit, I'm not homeless
Like all you rappers on your label's dick
Ya not controlling your shit like you're a disabled bitch
The Brooklyn hustler with the Psycho-Logical family
You disrespect us and we'll bust shots at you randomly
You gotta hand it to me, I made alot happen with nothin
At least now I'm clappin for somethin'

[Hook] x2
Bump this, rock this, pump this, obnoxious
Brutal slang, psycho shit, toxic in boxes
Kid sit back, absorb it, cuz you know this shit be morbid

[Necro]
You wanna flip? Go flip pancakes
I can't take cats that front with fake handshakes
You'll need more than a hundred bandaids on your face
When you get laced with blades, I can't wait
Your time's comin, watch it kill you
As I kid I fought dirtier than Mildew, and I still do
I'm still ill too, like when I was a kid runnin through the PJ's and I mushed you
And I'll mush you again, you're soft like a cushion, don't push me, I butcher men
I don't mean to brag, I sold green in a bag
To fat pigs and old men who need it bad
And thugs that got jipped but never popped shit
Cocaine with cut inserted like a Glock clip
I had to walk it, before I was able to talk it
So dont look at me awkward, get off it

[Hook] x2
