Chorus x 2
Kill that shit - kill that shit, I
Kill that shit - kill that shit, MUST
Kill that shit - kill that shit, KILL
Kill that shit - kill that shit, YOU

Verse 1

Necro empty patholigist
Demolishes the collagen in your face
When i smash you with a solid fist
Over politics get your wallet picked
By satanic scientoligists acknowledge this
I'm in a professionally insane condition
I cut vein incisions
In you so badly they need stitching by specially trained physians
Your death certificate is insignificant
Paper no different than you lasted terrific eulogy wipe my shit with it
You need proper protection from a person like me that feels no affection for your life i control the direction of ya future
Dead you look like a droid i seek through the void in your skull so we can't leave the casket open you're too destroyed
You better show respect with seriousness or the fear of sickness or death you will experience this
Another key turned to the essence you,ve returned
From the presence of your corpse a great deal can be learned

Chorus x 2
Kill that shit - kill that shit, I
Kill that shit - kill that shit, MUST
Kill that shit - kill that shit, KILL
Kill that shit - kill that shit, YOU

Verse 2

Slice you open with a Y shaped incision cause i hate religion
And fear no god so theres no consequences when i make decisions
So fucked plus the dead shit i'll desecrate you by suffocating you with the pillow that the dead person rested his head with
A stabbing fatality many abnormalities in your abdomen cavity
Except for gravity
Theres no blood pressure so no blood squirts when i sever
No blood on my shirts whenever i work its a perverse pleasure
What do i need the bible and satan for when i can start my own religion
Like carvin opening skulls with my braining saws
Planting micro-chips, lobotomies the pre-fix wizard to joining is funny
Come down to our office for a visit
Blending your cartilage stick you like a nintendo cartridge
Listen to the crescendo of your heart twitch
All your fault the power drill in your skull vault
Like pole vault, shaven bald, appauled its called assault

Chorus x 2
Kill that shit - kill that shit, I
Kill that shit - kill that shit, MUST
Kill that shit - kill that shit, KILL
Kill that shit - kill that shit, YOU
