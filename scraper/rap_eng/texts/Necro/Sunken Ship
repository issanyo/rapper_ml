It's Wombat
Fucken' spilt the bong
Yo
So drunk but still sinkin' like a sunken ship
The water shallow but fuck it I think I'm jumpin' in
I'm that scummy kid that's been rummagin' through your rubbish bin and takin' ciggy butts out of gutters disgusting nah for spin
I hit the beat with a drink of beam on the brink of leavin'
I'm sick of breathing I kick and scream I'm a livin demon
You see me lookin' half asleep but I'm not sick of dreamin'
I'll stick my penis in the scene until it's drippin' semen
I'm a snapper hater I scrap it like a gladiator
Always got that green on my scales like an alligator
Rally racer throwin' you away but I'll catcha later
If 360 laggin' on the calibrator
There ain't many rappers in Tassie semi relates to
Though I'm here to change the game like a babys brain when I shake you
I've been raised in a way that basically makes me hate you
'Coz I've been worshipping Satan since I've been playing my game Q
I would say to stop watch but you're outta time
Rowdy mind
Climbing up a pole it's not a power line
Studied how to rhyme now I'm rappin' bags at a pound a time
And fuck I sound divine like a holy spirit that's found alive
Im thinkin' I should wreck the system
My neck is twistin' a victim of devil exorcism
Never quittin' unless I'm dead by the defintion
Even if I die I'm resurrected by the wrecked spinnin'
Every christmas I've been gifted with a bag of coal
It has to be the fact I evac'd a cold or I lack a soul
Or maybe I  just happen to be spastic
Someone pack a bowl
I'll crack your skull with a mallet we'll call it whack a mole
I could turn the city street into the Sydney sieges cemetery
I'll turn the bondi beach into gallipoli
You hearin' me 'coz this just the beginnin' of a bigger scheme
You think your sick of me but then get addicted like nicotine
Sometimes I like to hibernate but I don't isolate
I rock up at 5 so late and strike the club like a tiger snake
I hit the green hard as Thailand tools 'coz I like to bait
Born and raised on an island state fucken' miles away
