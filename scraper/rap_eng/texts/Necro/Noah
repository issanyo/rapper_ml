[Verse 1 - DILTHRAX]

I let my thoughts leak unto the page
Like JFK's brains, on the CIA shootin' range
Gang game chess, everyday's an exchange
Interchanging gun spray, lives lost in gunplay
Everybody knows it, the Devil rules our Government
I'm Noah in the new age, waitin' on the covenant
Adhere to Lucifer or face God's punishment
Social mis-judgement, falsified substance
Bloodclot cops cop rocks and hotbox
Rocks in the drop-top then hopscotch and pot shots
Taking out children blame it on their pot socks
Smell an ounce of Rasta, and pop a slug impromptu
Real recognize real, I can see through your porky pies
Into your murky eyes, false teeth and fake lies
Stand and serve the reptiles and their false alibis
Lookin' at the sky, I close my eyes and bide my time
Meditating, manifesting my empire
Of goons who spit fire, and elevate higher
Than your average, fuck that we super savage
Smokin' on the cabbage, causin' lyrical damage
While the army's out attacking other countries
We got gang-bangin' and we all got the munchies
Hungry, for knowledge but the schools are full of junkies
Narcotics make you ugly
Praying for my brother but you know I ain't bother
Cause word to my mother, god is just a cover up
To butter up the followers, blind them with objects
Stories of prophets, killed for the profits
Nothing sees clearer than the mind's eye
Until the day I die i'm shoutin' militant minds
They say the criminals got black clothes in supply
But the uniform of the bad guy is a suit and a tie

[Outro - DILTHRAX]

Uhhh... that goes out to you Steelo...
