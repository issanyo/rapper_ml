[Intro]
Why do you eat people?
(Not people, brains!)

[Verse 1: Necro]
The Godfather of the gore genre
Fake mobsters get chopped Into pasta lasagna
Parmesan body part salsa
You bled like a bitch red sprit, second the fucking lid
Hit your a dick head cause blood is squirting out your head like piss
Attack bike goons, trooping up platoons, Like baboons
Pack you in a tomb, skin you alive like a raccoon
Decapitated chunks when the thirty eight dumps
Rep it like Tommy Huighet, leave you with amputated stumps
Perverted like Pee Wee Herman, the meat cleaver leaves you like Steve Irwin
Squirming with heart murmins like flesh sirloin
You better bet that I'm bein deader than dead
Your in the after life staring at your torso
From your beheaded head
Your fucking bugging cause
You disrespecting I'll be cutting jugulars
Rockin meat district butcher gloves
Hit your frontal lobe with scissors quick
Carve with a knife, Hemoglobin drizzle drip
Scar you for life on some prision shit

[Interlude]
You know, it looks like rigormortis is setting in

[Verse 2: Mr. Hyde]
Just one of my miserable actions
I'll leave you in visible tractions
I'm using a scissor for hacking
And both of my fists for cracking
In vision my zombies ripping your aunties, uncles, parents, grannies
And now the ravines attacks you with the quickness
Check your cabinets
The medicine, your head is in a place beyond a sedative
Your better off deserve it
The devil says your univalent
My crew of hate will fill the street
In a basement building, Built like Mr. T
Like Rocky 3, The cops will flee
And shock and dock your mockery
We're coming to get ya, Cut you to bits
With muddy mitts and stubbornness
The cruddy pics of guts you rip
Pick up the blood with hungry lips
If lifes a bitch than that's a wish
The vicious cycle get you sick
The feds will fish for hearts intestines
And the Marshall evidence
A style of racial slur
Lace your facials with my urine
Taste and waste the pace of burning
Like you ate liquid detergent
We'll hurt you kid I'm certain
You'll be murked by lurking merchants
That insert the blades
That slurp your brains
To circulate with vermin

[Outro]
I can feel myself rot
