[Verse 1: Havoc]
H, Living on the dark streets get your throat slit
Eyes open, nigga better stay focus
Got my wolves in here, that kush in the air
Make you disappear like Hokus Pokus
We'll never play fair, give a fuck who care
[?]
You heir to the throne, get aired on the throne
Muthafucka, I'm Damien's Omen

[Verse 2: Kid Fade]
Ready and willing, my pen is seated on penicillin
Drilling or filling feelings, or pin it and then I kill it
Concealing, my pen is killing
The villain that’s hitting, drill 'em
I’m chilling, able to make a million while your blood is spilling
Yelling laws, killing series like a holocaust, watch a baller [?]
Catching fire like a Molotov, y'all are falling off
Met them out of my peak, Kid Fade, Psych Ward
And we are playing for keeps

[Verse 3: Johnny Richter]
So who am I?
Johnny Richter from the West Side
[?] goes all day, zombie like all night
'Cause I might size you up then bite
Fuck with me, I'll rip your head out your windpipe
You in the panic 'cause all I did was damage
[?]
The reason why, fuck [?]

[Verse 4: Kool G Rap]
Kill a man for the kilogram
Kill a man back from the front with a slug like a militant
Feel a man nigga ran with a realer clan
Still a hand mover nigga fat like the thriller dance
Silverback you warm up like guerrilla plan
Still a band filler I'm a champ 'n' you still a fan
Pop a bottle in the club then we spill a grand
Garry Coleman your fucking head with a skillet pan

[Verse 5: Chino XL]
The titan that's rising from the back of the morgue
The barbarian created for war
Witness the villainous minister boss
Spit ridiculous, religious, sickening scriptures
With every bit of resilience and twisted wicked voice
Simple nobody holds candles to the syllable lord
And the temple be careful that's why the symbol of Hanukkah's for
Slap a whore dressed like Macklemore at a thrift store
I'mma cut above how you niggas think like a lobotomy's for

[Verse 6: Slaine]
Before I self-destruct where I stand today
With a hand grenade and just pull the pin
I'mma rant and rave, with a can of RAID
For you cockroaches in this piss pool of sin
This ghoulish grin and this mood I'm in
These psych drugs went and got my head all heavy
I had the worst verse in the first Underworld
Fuck, I'm supposed to be dead already

[Hook: Scratches by DJ Illegal]
You know me well!
Reel wolf!
Bury you in the Underworld

[Verse 7: Necro]
Psychedelic, Vicodin microphone villain
Trife like a Rikers felon, I strike your cerebellum
Nike acapella, compelling, incredible killing
Audible, verbal, recordable murder. homie I’m chilling
Encyclopedia, psycho media, Expedia
CD are greedier, music industry CPR
Smack you like crack chemicals
Pull out the gat and attack generals
You’re whack, you lack genitals

[Verse 8: Ruste Juxx]
Victorious, impervious champion
I am the streets my footprints stamped in
Every rap that I pin, raw A1
Spitting like a motherfucking M4A1
Ruste Juxx my long range accurate
Lyrical monster niggas scared to do a track with
Break backs with the greatest of ease
It's Crown Heights nigga, triple OG's

[Verse 9: Kuniva]
Somebody tell this chick in the trunk to keep it down
If them boys pull me over, I'm pulling them pieces out (BLOW)
I thought I told you tell her: keep it down
Dawg I did, man she cool
Then why the fuck her hands and feet stickin' out?
I'm trippin', you don't want to see this long-nose I'm grippin'
Like Scottie Pippen, I tear through him and everybody's pissin'
Kuniva don't be talkin' with snitches it's not a comedy
When I crack a nigga up and leave him in stitches
Bitches

[Verse 10: Sabac Red]
The American drug lords and African raids
North American greed, and Europeans relate
Australia’s finances, Asia is hell bound
With nuclear war and an Antarctican melt down
A state of urgency so I’m proposing a call
To stay focused on the good and the hope for us all
Explored seven continents within eight of these bars
Crawl out the Underworld and see how related these are

[Verse 11: Ill Bill]
Black mask like Jihadi John
Wax like molly wong
Rap's Tommy Chong
Burn sherm like Bob Marley's bong
Hit that bitch with a gnarly dong
Pop off in her mouth like Mardi Gras
Wipe my dick off on her mother's couch, sorry mom
Fucking party on
Hung like Donkey Kong
And in control like Marley Marl
Exploding cult leader
Make that bitch gargle and swallow
Then burp up a whole liter

[Verse 12: Sean Price]
Extort your team nigga
Beef in the street with the pork and beans nigga
Swine on your mind, divine on my grind
No time to recline I'm trying to get mine
I get it while the gettin' is good
I'm good at gettin' it God the shit in the hood
Boy be shootin', loud shots noise pollution
I'm real, I don't build, I destroy your movement
P!
