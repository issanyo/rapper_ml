[Intro]
Hahaha
Sick (woooow)
(psyco logical street villians volume one brand new shit)
Ill bill and Necro! Check it out
Brand new, exclusive shit
Pay attention

[Ill Bill]
The music business is morons, faggots, and idiots
Flamers like Branch Dividians
Pussys bleeding through pants from periods
We're street villians just another word for goons
Big black gats and braincells burned from shrooms
The future is speaks now or forever hold your heat close
Meet ho's with pretty faces and deep throats
Blow a load
Leave em alone
I sell em some blow
And when they ask me for free coke, i'm tellin em no Telling your story walkin
Banging in your Sony Walkman
Catch me walking with porno bitches often
The swordsman
Circle Of Tyrants the gore-met of violence
At your position
Wildin like Howie on a ten year mission
My music for scumbags, Murderers, and mobsters, violent monsters, cop killers, live in concert
So much weed
Call us to joint the chiefs of staff
Creeps with masks
Murder you for no reason fag!

[Necro]
I strut up freaking different voices
Rockin a wig
It's America so i can snuff you or shoot you
I got choices
With the freedom
To reach in to my holster and unleash
Dum, dums
That'll fling you into the air higher then Hashish
So move you're frame back
Fuck capisce cause I'm down to flex
Bringing burners to studio sessions for sound effects, rocking a disguise incognito
Code of bushido
Revenge attack
Torpedo
Blastin your broken bones Aikido
You can't decipher it
Why would I bludgeon my enemy's skull
And stick a knife in it
Cause for this Hip-Hop shit  i'll die for it
Without music i'm dead
Only thing that calms my head
Except receiving head
We see from bread sleeping in bed
I was born bent
See more death then a corpse
My brains been warped
Way before you knew what the word meant
Shocking you like electricity through the tits
I'm on a deathbed with ten diseases
Now who is sick?
