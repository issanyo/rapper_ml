Cut a y-shape incision into ya chest, don't ask why
Division of ya flesh with the scalpel
From one shoulder to the next
Extended to the midline of the pubic symphysis
Symphonies of sickness
Emphasis on your corpse in the metamorphosis of rigor mortis
Your ligaments as stiff as a board gets, it's morbid
Your orbs stuck, with a needle
Technical like Gorguts, autopsy procedure
In a case with a single hair we traced it
A rapist fucked you heinously in your anus
Slicing your subcutaneous tissue is miscellaneous
It resembles Kentucky fried poultry
Ripped to pieces when hungry like a poor country
You're unlucky, you got dismembered, now I'll re-assemble you back like a puzzle like scrabble, did you guzzle poison?
Or dabble in a squabble or a tussle where you got hit with metal marbles in ya chest muscles
The focal hemorrhage was caused by a chokehold
Lack of oxygen, cerebral hypoxia
My vocals are like local anesthetics, paralyzation
Like Marilyn Monroe's overdosage on Nembutal Barbiturates
Inflammation, in the abdominal cavity is information
Implication of a possible tragedy, to the anatomy
Reek of putrification Peritonitis, yellowish pus like sinus
Perish flesh like Perry Como's Alzheimer's
Neuropsychiatrically did his mind in
The carcass looks like Parmesan with sprinkles of farmer cheese poured on someone's carved up arm
The lowest common denominator of humans get turned on
When you get embalmed, brutal like Saddam Hussein's children when they were bombed by planes
