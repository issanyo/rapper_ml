[Intro]
Warning! The truly unusual motion picture you are about to see contains many scenes of Graphic Violence. (The real) It is not intended for the faint of heart (Hip hop) nor the young and impressionable

[Verse 1: Necro]
Fuck your wifey, run up on you, Hyphy, holding a knifey
You ain't a soldier, boy, I'm running with Ice-T
Mixed with Vodka, sitting shotgun with the Glock
'Pon cock, taking hip hop back
Shoot up your commercial block, pop, pop, pop
You are not rugged, you should stop rapping Hops
You are not hip hop, you on some faggot shit dancing like a bitch
You sold out Herc and all of that work, wasted for talentless bullshit

[Interlude 1]
Try to challenge this, we could fight G
I rep my shit, head up, dead up
What up? Get wet up or cut up
Where you wanna meet up to get beat up?

[Verse 2: Necro]
I'm not bigger than the drama don't get me mixed up
I'll battle Jigga tomorrow, I got a reputation
For bashing a face in and even when I make my millions
I'll be down for confrontation
I rap for the kids in buildings with little education
Urban children, herbing you daily's our occupation
Suburban kids get with it too
But do ya history, know what you're listening to
Don't be a drone or I'm dissing you
Rap clones, I piss on you, biters don't make me smack you holmes
You weak like arthritis, don't sleep on me like Itis
We're street fighters and we keep heat right beside us
In case you too pussy for a fair one like Commodus

[Interlude 2]
What up pa? Why you turn Bourgeois?
You used to be raw, now you a whore
That's what you call mature?

[Verse 3: Necro]
I'll stay an immature grown man
Rhyming hardcore for fans, my indie is major
I hustle harder than the brain muscles
Of Master P and Russell combined
Do what it takes, even if I gotta bust you with a nine

[Hook]
Aww shit, I am a nightmare walking
Psychopath talking
The real, hip hop
Aww shit, the science I drop is real heavy
The real, hip hop
Bring it back, come rewind

[Verse 4: Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, when you see us you better pay homage
I'm on some combat shit like early day carcass
How you identify a body from they cartilage?
50 deuce, park side killer, blade sharpeners
Philly soundtrack, Abel Ferrerra
I will catch a fucking homicide, lay 'em, whoever
DJ Miz, heat will fucking slay 'em and sever
If you think that either one of us is playing, whatever
(Well fuck you)
Go up in ya face with the open hand pliers
Old school like sneakers hanging from overhead wires
Y'all just  getting warmed up, pussy, we set fires
We the hardest rappers that's living but y'all biters (but y'all biters)
Load up the trunk with the motherfuckin' arsenal
I'm about to spray your fuckin' wig like a barber do
I'm a loose cannon, there's no telling what I'mma do
Shooting innocent motherfuckers like they was Amadou

[Hook]
Aww shit, I am a nightmare walking
Psychopath talking
The real, hip hop
Aww shit, the science I drop is real heavy
The real, hip hop
Bring it back, come rewind

[Verse 5: Immortal Technique]
Immune to Ebola and never got the swine flu
And when you say it like that, it shows a different side of you
Reminding you of the rights that are now denied to you
How elements that compose the sun are inside of you
But you didn't come here for knowledge and wisdom
America rubs it's pussy to dead children
Truth, no modesty, no apology, odium
Go home and let the cable TV wash over you
Ya life's a microcosm of the world's problems
But you don't even have the perspective to try to solve 'em
No compassion, remorse, or any type of future seeing
Government being run by people that are barely human beings
Who claim we were brainwashed by hip hop music
But now pop culture propaganda's how they use it
Crack 'em with the black jack on a Necro track
Snatch your chain and hump the dance floor, I'm taking it back
Bitch

[Hook]
Aww shit, I am a nightmare walking
Psychopath talking
The real, hip hop
Aww shit, the science I drop is real heavy
The real, hip hop
Bring it back, come rewind
Aww shit, I am a nightmare walking
Psychopath talking
The real, hip hop
Aww shit, the science I drop is real heavy
The real, hip hop
Bring it back, come rewind
