[Verse 1]
Attack you like a blazing raptor
You'll never adapt to enslavement
You'll be craving for your captors to clap ya
Crucified and defiled, extra gruesome and vile
You're a douchebag so you got killed executioner style
I spawn satanic raps like Luther's child
My automatic brap, right through your hooptie in style
Tricked you, a bayonet from chariots carrying TEC's
Bury you in the casket, the master of marrying
Then she'll blast you like Bernard Goetz, this is as hard as it gets
Beat you repeatedly like a retard with Tourettes
Catch you in the street, and beat you to death for ten cents
'Cause your like is worth less, you're worthless, yes
Leave you a bloody mess, like drug traffickers
Blasting slugs in the middle of traffic
They'll bust ya then laugh at ya
Everyone dies, there'll be another kingpin after ya
Nobody gives a fuck when you're layed up with a catheter

[Chorus]
Gat 0'9 Tales
The Gat 0'9 Tales
Ain't nothing frail, fuck around and end up in jail with no bail
Shit's real

[Verse 2]
Catholic, Jewish or Muslim
Christian, Pagan or Atheist
We all have the same fate, as humans: death awaits for us
You should count your blessings, a bandage in dressing
Around your intestines, it could of festered
Almost breathless, non-confessing
No more comp' in hip hop, this shit's a disgrace
We should piss on your face, then stomp you to death in flip flops
Died on the mic, I'll never forget how to grab you by your neck and slide into spite
'Cause killing you's like riding a bike
Grab a bitch by the collar bone, smack her in the cerebellum
Yellin' get off that telephone, Earth is your home
Blaze a tool at you, have you pushin' up daises
But it doesn't faze anyone, everybody's acting like a [?]
Being pussy's got you far, driving through the hood
You scared to stop your car, 'cause you think someone'll pop you par
But you're worse off coming across a cop car, when they toss your vehicle
And make up a reason to lock you up

(Chorus)
[Chorus]
Gat 0'9 Tales
The Gat 0'9 Tales
Packing that steel, fuck around and end up in jail, 'cause someone squealed on real
