(Necro)

I'm a Quiet Riot bringing the Loudness
Like when a 4 pound spits
Like when a Slayer ground pits
'86 at The Ritz 36 crazy fists
My posse in a dance
18 of us rocking you possessed like Ozzy sniffing ants
The Death Angel kills the Blind Illusion of Exodus
A Heathen performing Forbidden Violence as my Testament
Doing the Toxic Waltz boxing getting in brawls
Holding Glocks if beef pops we go Balls To The Wall
World Downfall Raise Ya Fist And Yell
Drunk like Chris Holmes Megalomaniac Women Leather And Hell
I'm a Zakk Wylde Child like Manson Mobscene
Fucking Tawny Kitaen with my Whitesnake then cum on her like Rammstein
Shred you like Malmsteenmy souls fly, Kill, Fuck, Die
None shall Defy I'm your Sadus Your soul I deny
Lighting To The Nations, Bestial Devastation
From Enslavement to Obliteration, I'm Bigger Than Satan

(Ray Alder)

Death Rap
Extreme violence and brutal murder
Cut your head off with a machete
Evil Rules
(Repeat)

(Necro)

I'll Put you on a eat shit-diet
Start a mosh pit riot
And kill someone don't knock it till you try it
Grab a Glock cock it pressure apply it
To the trigger nothings fresher than me buy it. suicide decide it
Cyanide provided, sayonara. Sleep in a sepultura sarcophagus
Look in my eyes of horror stab your esophagus the harvester of sorrow
Carvin ya mental like John Carpenter backwards like Bizarro
Yesterday is tomorrow pull a razor on you
Cut you consecutively occasionally deja vu
Executive producer of brutality suduce your mentality
A noose around your jugular capillary
Vascular suffocation potent like a methadone
Mongoloid shootin up masculine mescaline from a rodent
Step to you with the power of Odin
And make you gush a blood shower
Till your flesh is like slush, your bowels exploding
