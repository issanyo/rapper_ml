[Chorus]
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Stories of the almost dead
Homie almost got bodied
For his foul words
While bent caught a kitchen knife
In his heart valve
Insert a stent
Blade moving to the beat
Failed murder attempt
Fucked around with someone disturbed
Converted to Satan
Inverted pent
Ya life revolved around crime
And never evolved until you got
Popped with the revolver
Thinking shit's sweet like Halva
Almost got eaten by larva
If the surgeons didn't study
The vena cava
You'd be a cadaver
Half naked cunt
Walking the streets shaking ya rump
Intoxicated drunk
Not looking when you cross traffic
Hit by an inebriated chump
Chopped off ya leg on the sidewalk
A designer decapitated
Pump a lacerated stump
You lay slump
You needed to lose weight
Well that's a big chunk
Cannibals would eat that for lunch
Let Jesus into ya life
Now and live as a humble gimp
As opposed to a dead cunt
Still got your camel toe in the front
You were

[Chorus]
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead

[Verse 2]
You robbed some crackheads
They want their shit back
You'll get back
Slapped and cracked
With a stick in the front and back of ya skull cap
For taking their capsules
You little asshole
Vagrants with dirty fragrance
Down to murder over a glass bowl
Vandals kicking ya grill in sandals
Keeping it vile
Treating you like a mom beating a disobedient child
Meat tenderized
Human schnitzel grill
Mushed in you got your shit pushed in
Almost got ya kangol severed
Practically dangling like Bojangles
The blade hit you at a unique angle
Lucky it didn't cut the carotid putrid
They were able to suture it
You got a future kid next time
Just shoot this kid
Your life isn't worth the price of ya goods
That's why you got sliced in the hood as trife
As they could
It amazes me what the human body
Can live through
Razor invasions to ya skin
Abrasions, concussions, contusions
You lucky cousin

[Chorus]
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
You tell 'em
Almost dead
