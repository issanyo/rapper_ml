Frank Zito, Tamma, For Ralphus (For Ralphus)
Natacha Dinatelli, Shout out to Saddam
Do it, (laughing)

[Hook - Necro]
White slavery when bitches get put under seige
Shoved into a van and kidnapped right from the street
Never to be seen again by any of their peeps
Just a victim buried deep in the world of creeps
Who roam through alleyways associating with freaks
You'll never be found but cops will be searching for weeks
Looking for leaks, hoping somebody speaks
While your brain is washed and your memory they delete

[Verse 1 - Ill Bill]
Women need to be loved, injected with needles and drugs
Subjected to torture and kidnapped they need to succumb
It's proven, I feed em dog food, they prefer human
Make 'em savagely beat each other bloody for my amusement
It's all fun and games, I keep 'em handcuffed in chains
Sexually make 'em do the most disgusting things
Starve 'em to cannibals, make 'em eat each others' brains
Changed and deranged, stores begin to seem like nothings strange
While retarded acquaintances get fist fucked and raped
Covered in lighter fluid, lit up and engulfed in flames
Sound proof walls guarantee to muffle your screams
Squirm on a shit stained mattress in a puddle of pee

Selling you to the highest bidder for a bundle of D
And I'mma be a scumbag till I'm a hundred and three
Throw you in the back of a van, rag stuck in ya teeth
Smothered in chloroform, you wake up smothered in creeps

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Necro]
I'm enslaving women from Ukraine, they don't understand English
But they understand pain, It's the language of anguish
Your situation's hopeless, deceived into dancing topless
Then force you into prostitution with coke heads
Police keep the silence while you sleep with clients
You protest you won't eat and you get beat like a child does
And when you're destroyed like women from Latvia
You'll be sold to the Muslim part of Bosnia by the mafia
From where there is no return forever
You'll be on ya knees labeled a coffee table in leather
We have no hearts with mafiosi, evil like Bela Lugosi
White slavery O.G.'s that own police
Full of hate, Spanish midgets pull you out of crates
Kidnapped women dangled from chains; their fate: to be raped
Killers with Frank Zito cuts deliver slaves in vans
From Iran that's delicacy like a gorilla's liver
Like the stench of a roach

We'll bring it to you critics fowl like a blowgun
And a naked chick in a trenchcoat
Chopping your feet of, don't shut the beat off
Leave it, believe it we're coming to cut the meat off
And meat cleave it
