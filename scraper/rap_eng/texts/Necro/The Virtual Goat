[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
2025 alive, solar powered nines, hard times
Sometimes I'm surprised that the world's even survived
A world of weapons
A world of deception, technological tension
I take drugs to forget freedom of expression
I'd rather not dwell on evil intentions
I'd rather fuck a hologram
Fuck with these evil inventions
Remember when porn was one dimensional?
Evil angels will implant images in your brain to have sex with you
The girl of your choice, fuck an interactive menu
Pop a pill to trigger the system implanted in you
A simple operation redefining the term go fuck yourself;
In a simple conversation I see
Model religion collapse under money and machines
God is the remote control and your laptop computer screen
Computer worship
Make you lose it and shoot a person
Log in for another consumer purchase

[Verse 2: Goretex]
World down for
And the time raw, enter the round door
Cold war, splattered you feed it like coke snort
[?]
Sanitation rolling your limb with the garbage of fish
Bloods, crips and killers
Ratchets for doing the thriller
Handle my biz', but don't you dare ruin my dinner
Feminine thug, you more like an actual flamer
Pull your rug out, steal your bitch and clap in a Layla
Screaming "Hey, pelican," trains of coke on my cock
Where the hoes at, you rappin' for them kids on lock
Hate me - cause I hate you too
We shake hands the American way
Then settle it with clips and Glocks
Trippin' off kid, ayy, rip your eye out, like Thom Yorke
Carry a torch for execution, style and sport
We toured drive-bys on the mongoose for poor
This ain't rhetorical, we'll body you up, prolly the next tour
