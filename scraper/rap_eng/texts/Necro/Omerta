(Intro)
A succession of Mafia defectives have put Gotti
And his fellow Mafia bosses in jail for life
Omerta the vow of silence under pain of death
Is no longer sacred

(NECRO)
Let off the pistol chrome at any Joe
Pistone confessed to an Episcopal bishop
How my biscuit clip domes
The biggest mob figures and gunslingers together
In the same room for a ritual my trigger finger's severed
As this card burns may my soul burn in hell forever
If I betray the oath of Omerta
Don’t push a button man’s button
Ill bloody up anyone that butt in and stab your mans gut in
Blood in blood out
Rammed up the butt end
For your moronic plea coppin
Cause they caught you with electronic eavesdropping
Now something demonic screaming please stop em
Stop the meat cleaver chop em
Canned
That’s our society(’s) secret keep em quiet option
The boss will sanction a shanking
Than you’ll thank him for the privelege of being ranked as the pillager of anxious action
My counsel varies
Concealed pencil like utensil
In your frontal lobe mental
Thank you consigliere

(Hook/Necro)
We'll murder anybody any time any place
At the snap of a finger pop you in the face
Issue contracts to kill people never say us
Sentence you to motherfucken death if you betray us
Peace to all the gangsters doing time in Marion
Rikers, Leavenworth, Folsom, Attica we'll carry on tradition
The most powerful
Godfathers in America
GRap and Necro
You cowards fold

(Kool G Rap)
Balls get slit on a fraudulent bitch
Holdin a dish
Rope all on this wrist
Fist all on the fifth
Paint the wall with your shit
No luck fuck
Boy you non McCoy
Un-official
I squeeze hard on the pistol
Make your arteries sizzle
You lay down
Put the tre pound Guard on your whistle
To you sodomy tickle
Your shit all hard and your nipples
Make you sleep longer than Van Winkle
Fuck stomach cuts
I hope your stomach guts and my hands mingle
Tuck chromey in a tuxedo
Tuss a lonley
And fuck any tough Tony
Plus his homies
Fucked up hobby clown
You Bobby Brown's Tender Roni
Leave ya mom's head in your bed
We don't touch ponies
Valors we're vowless
Leave niggas forty caliber styled in
(??Tapis??) Afghan Taliban Wildman
Screw on silencers and (??east island??)
Over the ????
Commission vocal splittin your throat
Niggas is prowlin

(Hook/Necro)
We'll murder anybody any time any place
At the snap of a finger pop you in the face
Issue contracts to kill people never say us
Sentence you to motherfucken death if you betray us
Peace to all the gangsters doing time in Marion
Rikers, Leavenworth, Folsom, Attica we'll carry on tradition
The most powerful
Godfathers in America
GRap and Necro
You cowards fold

(Out)
Just When I thought I was out
They pulled me back in
