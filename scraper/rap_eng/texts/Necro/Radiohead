(I'm a Radiohead, I'm a Radiohead)

Coming this winter, straight jackets by North Face
Tour’d 3 all girl schools and could spit out how each whore taste
Record shops'll see more fiends than a Detox
When Cage shit drops, like LSD blots
You can't handcuff what you can't snuff
Before your body's embalmed I dipped the philly for a puff
Keep your eyes peeled - make sure your teams packing the Glocks kids
Pour disinfectant in they ears I'm speaking noxious
Alex the baby came after after birth
I ain't been straight with God since he dropped my ass on Earth
You gonna burn for that!
Then burn me right now Paul
My scalp still wears a scar from that lobotomy seminar
Can't help but act out, when I black out
I push my brother's eyes in then I kicked them back out
You kids trying to blast at me better learn to shoot straighter
Premature brains get cooked up in the incubator (pssssss)
Page 67, Paragraph 2
Show precision in your ‘how to skin MC’s alive manual’

I'm a Radiohead, getting open 'til I'm brain dead
Then I'm getting open 'til you brain dead
I'm a Radiohead, getting open 'til I'm brain dead
Then I'm getting open 'til I brain dead

I was possessed by Dionysus
Kicked outta highschool for giving paps smears of crisis
Cold-type ciphers
I burn motherfuckers 'til the fume kicks
Watch me fuck them four Craft bitches to death with broom sticks
Sweeping with chicks, lacing up dicks, getting lovely
'Til I'm spaced out roughly like Martians playing rugby (aha)
See a vigilante, shoot him 'til his heart stops
And send his eyes to the cops in a box for crime watch
Slipped out the snatch, wipe my face clean of the crap
That's been holding me back since minus 9 months my leaky sack
Blind ya!
T. EC. Behind ya!
Who could undermine the?
Sickest of intelligence to find ya!
The VAGINA RE-DESIGNAH
Get you opened out your mind ya
Sent to death trynna slide out your own spine ta
Find a life where your cock's treated like Christ
And every cunt from up the block will beg forgiveness from your sex device

I'm a Radiohead, getting open 'til I'm brain dead
Then I'm getting open 'til you brain dead (x2)

Obnoxious crotches
Smack they ass 'til skin blotches
Mail bombin'
Weather from Holland
Still smilin'
Fishburne like Lawrence
Agent Orange
Revived a victim then locked her in cold storage
Ate a pussy popped
Stumped her under vulture nigga blocks
Analyze the blood clots, before greater body rots
Factual photo: puss pierced shut
Seared slut Josie
Used to take facials mostly
Gang this bong
While I pick that Lionel Ritchie afro cunt out all night long
I'm into like... (fffff) altering my perception
Emptied a clip in my reflection for looking my direction

I'm a Radiohead, getting open 'til I'm brain dead
Then I'm getting open 'til you brain dead (x2)

(I'm a Radiohead, I'm a Radiohead
The nasty Agent Orange is comin'
Bright and early in the mornin'
With the Necro coroner behind drumin'
On the severed headpiece of your woman)
