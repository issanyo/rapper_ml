[Spoken: Uncle Howie]
She knows it from before
She was an alcoholic
I walked her to her house
She said "excuse me"
She came back with shorts on
That was split on the sides
So I asked her "why did you put them on in front of me?"
She said "cuz I don't wear underwear"
So I asked her "can I see what you... "
She said "no no no "
She said, it's the weirdest thing
She says to me "wow it's so much better than my husbands", you know?
And that's what happened
I gave her a little crack
And I didn't stop
She was up in my fucking house
Pain, I couldn't
I couldn't keep her away man
I couldn't keep her away
Sucking dick all the time
For a hit
For a fucking hit
It was fucking ridiculous
Her husband was working two jobs
One of her kids was mentally retarded
And still, a fucking alcoholic
That turned crackhead
And you know what?
I wouldn't mind going back there

Word up, you can take me with you
