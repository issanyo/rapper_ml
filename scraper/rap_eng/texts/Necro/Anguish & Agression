My anguish and aggression
Cuz pain is awesome we live off it
My anguish and aggression

(Necro)
If you mess with me Your destiny's to Rest in Peace
No, actually Rest in Pain
Rest in Pieces
Gradually Death increases Annually
Stranglin you manually
I'm a hang a bully by the throat
And practically watch him choke
In agony
You're no match for me you're weak
Like bone atrophy you'll bleed
A catastrophe you'll leak of it
Anarchy you seek
Off the balcony a leap
Kill yourself, Jump to your death
And brutally break everything under your flesh

My anguish and aggression
Cuz pain is awesome we live off it
My anguish and aggression(2x)

I'll never stop seeking to increase
The number of fans I got
As long as I keep
Dropping clever beatings each release
On the underground I'll stab someones brain
Sever the top til it's bleeding in pieces you scumbag
It's Sir Manson-a-Lot
It's impossible for a hardcore hip hop head
To function fully without bumpin Necro in his tape deck
You could pop a pill But still you'd drop dead
From malnutrition of Brutality
You're on your death bed wishin you copped it

My anguish and aggression
Cuz pain is awesome we live off it
My anguish and aggression(2x)

I'm a close friend
With open-minded sickos That kill closed-minded cats
And comatose men
I'll offer you constructive advice
Sign on the dotted line
If you wanna get fucked for your rights
Stuck in a bad contracts like being stuffed in a coffin
For a seductive price
How much for you to give up your life?
Necro without ownership and his dough right
Is like both of your hands chopped off tryin a hold a mic

My anguish and aggression
Cuz pain is awesome we live off it
My anguish and aggression(2x)
