[Verse 1]
This goes to those whove awakened
Rose up and taken
Control of mind and their souls not forsaken
Rappers turned slaves now they´re faking
Guess its a must, that they lust for the cash that they rake in
I´m about to unmask these fake emcees
Let me expose them to the public and make them see
Spitting rhymes that´s infesting teens
Why not teach them how to start manifesting dreams
That praise money type shit is worthless
Time to learn this, take that out and their music is wordless
My rap style is leaving them nervous
The type to make Biggie and Pac nod in their grave if they heard this

Mac Miller, fact is i´m iller
Why this bitch trying to act like she´s got some black in her
A new trend is out you gotta have it
See that´s a bad habbit
Now you walk around dressed like a faggot
Fuck them jordans and your snapback
Floss your feet, but you´re soft and sweet like a snackpack
You´re getting smoked like a kobe steak
And that´s your own mistake
Who´s got some bars they can loan this fake

Sam Adams rhymes you´re wack at ´em
I´m sure you´re probably good at Call of Duty or at Madden
But as far as rap, you won´t make it friend
I saw your videos trying to rap homie, while you´re hugging naked men

Fuck swag, fuck all that shit
