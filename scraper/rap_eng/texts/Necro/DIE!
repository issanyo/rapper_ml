[Intro: Uncle Howie]
In my lifetime I’ve died a few times. A couple of months ago I went out; they had to bring me back twice from death. Let me tell you something: when you die you ain’t taking your wallet with you up there! You ain’t even taking your underwear!

[Verse 1: Necro]
You never went to jail, you’re shook from the look of it
I invented Hell when I took a shit
My religion is music and abusing bitches
Snitch I’ll make you a eunuch, a loser dickless
Saget of the human trafficking racket
Beat the shit out of Jesus for being a faggot
Skeez into techno, douchebag die
Believe in Necro, you’ll be crucified
Speak the gospel of an asshole like Simmons
Selling Kiss caskets harassing women
Don’t test me, finish your breath G
My ministry is from a sinister ancestry
Crass gynaecologist, fuck a female activist
You took it in your ass by your misogynist
Plump like a putrid eighty-year-old bitch
I’ll worship you like Buddha’s fat gold tits

[Hook]
Die, die, die
When I hurt you - you die
Die, die, die
When I hurt you - you d-

[Verse 2: Necro]
A disgrace since birth, you’ll soon be dead
The holiest place on earth an exit wound through your head
Don’t try to enter my plain of existence
I’ll blast the center of your brain with a biscuit
No matter what remain sadistic, maintain persistence
Break every chain of resistance
Any lame gets in my way in this game
I’ll make sure every vein in your frame is spritzing
Fuck peace, you want it with me? Please
Your seeds are now abductees from Chuck Cheese
Hit like Michael Spinks with a bike link
Attack your think hole like an Inca with a spiked drink
Had a tough career, kid I don’t care
I’ve been suffering for years, Hell is right here
Shut your trap, that’s enough shit out of you
Trap you to clap you, I’ll make a snuff flick out of you

[Hook]

[Outro: Bob Dylan]
And I hope that you die
And your death’ll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
‘Til I’m sure that you’re dead
