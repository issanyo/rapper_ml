Yo, Yo

Yo!

[Necro]
Leave you stiff, like a cat puffin coke and weed in a spliff
Nose broken, bleeding, drift away as they lift you on a stretcher ripped
Images of organ incisions get you sick
While you puke up what you chewed up, Now chew up what you threw up
Left in the morgue, food, flesh for a dog
Funeral organs rock a -?
You're wheeled away, now every day your flesh will peel away
Sever decay, maggot infest, rot, dragged and dropped in a plot forever slayed
Slide you inside the cremation chamber
The system of erasing your existence, with flames of nature
Freebase and angel dust is danger, euthanasia
Methods of death stranger, than the sounds of a flanger
Burnt to a carcass, I watch the fires spark old
Then I deliver your family a parcel filled with charcoal
The neurosurgeon, your regurgitating detergent, I urge you to worship
You're on the verge of becoming a servant
There's no physical evidence you existed, when your ashes get pissed on
No one remembers a bitch, kid!
I determine you'll be eaten by vermin, German cockroaches
Squirming through you - Locusts and worms in your skin

[Hook]
We're living in a world gone mad, a crazy world
A world where death is a way of life
Every day we read of atrocities that numb the brain
But I believe to deny what is insane
Or to try to flee from it is to submit to it
To be at the mercy of it when you should just study it
To enjoy life - Chill with me
As we descend into this world gone mad
A world of dying and killing sprees

[Necro]
You're dead, and you'll never come back, you got murdered by a scumbag
The type that doesn't realize that he's done bad
He's walking the streets free, while you're 6 feet deep
Police close the case, plus there's no trace, you're beat
I'll write a verse on your toe tag, you'll get suffocated
With a bag over your face, you'll gag with no air ventilated
I rock a mask, for the stench of rotting corpses does not smell like a box of chocolates
Your cadaver's packaged, in suitcases and travel baggaged
And buried under gravel in secluded places
I got an appetite for abduction, we kidnap women
Torture them, brainwash them and fuck them
I'm a carnivore, my teeth are sharp made
For ripping flesh like blades that carve through body parts

[Hook]
We're living in a world gone mad, a crazy world
A world where death is a way of life
Every day we read of atrocities that numb the brain
But I believe to deny what is insane
Or to try to flee from it is to submit to it
To be at the mercy of it when you should just study it
To enjoy life - Chill with me
As we descend into this world gone mad
A world of dying and killing sprees
