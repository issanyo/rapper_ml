(Yeah, new shit)

[Verse 1:]
I got plans for you and me
We both need to move on
Cause you ain't what i need
It took some time for me to find out

I didn't sign up for misery
And no, we can't work it out
Things ain't the same way
That they used to be
Cause you don't feel for me no more

[Chorus:]
I got some new clothes
New kicks
I got a new crib
New whip
All your drama
I don't miss
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit

I can't believe I was with you
All the pain that I went through
I sing a new song
New hit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit

[Verse 2:]
Now, boy
Don't start blowing up my phone
I thought I told you to be gone
(Be gone)
Had the chance to make things right
But you kept doing me wrong

This ain't a break-up to make-up game
I'mma do you how you did me
Cause this is a new day
New change
New me
I'm moving on to some new shit

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Now that I know
He ain't the one for me
Now I know this
Now I know this
Now I know this
So tell me
Would it

Tell me
Would it make sense for me not to leave
You know I'm already going
I guess it's time to move on

[Repeat Chorus:]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)

I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
