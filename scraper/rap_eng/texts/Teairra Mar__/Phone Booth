Damn ring, now my life ain't been through nothing but the drama
Just had the worst fight ever with my mama
She believes that you've got two or three on the come up
Telling me you're loving me, but you're going home to them
Damn I hope she's wrong cause boy I love the ground you walk on
She knows that your ties in the streets can be fatal
She's threatening to disown me if I don't let this go
Lord can you help me before I blow
I'm so afraid

I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off, I can't take no more
Can you come and get me from the phone booth
She's telling me to break up
Cause you ain't gonna do nothing but hurt me
Come get me from the phone booth
It's raining, I'm crying
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth
My mom just pissed me of, I can't take no more
Can you come and get me

Boy on phone: Baby, baby are you alright? Why you crying man? Teairra

If I leave where will I go
Will you take me in like you told me before
Prove that she was just being hysterical
Show that what she thinks ain't reality, no
I love her, I do
Same time, I love you
But you both are making me choose
See what I go through for you
Boy you better hope the future that you're promising me
Is as real as the 45 up under you seat
Come on

I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off, I can't take no more
Can you come and get me from the phone booth
She's telling me to break up
Cause you ain't gonna do nothing but hurt me
Come get me from the phone booth
It's raining, I'm crying
Damn I hope he ain't been lying to me
Come get me from the phone booth
My mom just pissed me of, I can't take no more
Can you come and get me

I've been through so much
I can't be done like that again
Hope you ain't been running game cause I'm so in need
All my love that's gonna give me what every girl prays for each day
Though I don't see your care, I hope that you're on the way

I'm at the phone booth
My mom just pissed me off, I can't take no more
