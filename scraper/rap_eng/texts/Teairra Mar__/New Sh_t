I got plans for you and me
We both need to move on
'Cuz you ain't what I need
It took some time for me to find out
I didn't sign up for misery
And no we can't work it out
Things ain't the same way that they used to be
'Cuz you don't feel for me no more
I got some new clothes, new kicks
I got a new crib, new whip
All your drama, I don't miss
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
I can't believe I was with you
All the pain that I went through
I sing a new song, new hit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
Now boy, don't start blowing up my phone
I thought I told you to be gone
(Be gone)
Had the chance to make things right
But you kept doing me wrong
This ain't a break up to make up game
I'ma do you how you did me
'Cuz this is a new day, new change, new me
I'm moving on to some new shit
I got some new clothes, new kicks
(New kicks)
I got a new crib, new whip
(New whip)
All your drama, I don't miss
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
I can't believe I was with you
All the pain that I went through
(All the pain I went through)
I sing a new song, new hit
(New hit)
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
Now that I know he ain't the one for me
(Now I know this, now I know this)
(Now I know this, so tell would it)
Tell me, would it make sense for me not to leave?
You know I'm already going
I guess it's time to move on
I got some new clothes, new kicks
I got a new crib, new whip
All your drama, I don't miss
(I don't miss)
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
(Boy, I'm on some new shit)
I can't believe I was with you
All the pain that I went through
I sing a new song, new hit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I'm on some new shit)
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
I'm so over you, boy
I'm on some new shit
