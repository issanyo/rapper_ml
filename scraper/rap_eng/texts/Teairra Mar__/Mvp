(Verse 1:)
Well let me start out by saying this
And there ain't no game in this
Don't even think you waste my time
I know that I'm not the only one
So don't get it twisted son
No, I don't think that you're all mine
Baby boy what I do know
Is that I'm inexpandable
You'll never find another like me
Cuz all the others just fall in line
I come first and they're behind
This is where you need to be

(Hook:)
Cuz you think that I'm just whatever (Whatever)
Trust me, it don't get no better

But I know you won't disagree

Boy you can't lie
You know that I'll be everything you need (you need)

That's why I'm your wifey
Can't another girl on earth see me (See me)

Cuz it ain't going down like that
And yeah I know you got plenty friends and I'm just one of them
But baby I'm not falling back
I just want you to know that I'm still gonna ride for you
Cuz we still have fun
