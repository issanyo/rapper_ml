Mr. Vegas, Teairra
Don’t you wanna see me, yeah?

Girl you are… my time
Every time you’re passing your pump um shorts
I put ‘em on, you could take ‘em off
Girl, …
Every time you’re passing your pump um shorts
Don’t you wanna see me, yeah?

…
Put on your pump um shots…
Sexy on the air, when you step upon the showa
Hot in your pump um shorts…
My girl is asking not to be..
I know my…

Chorus:
Uh, don’t you wanna see me yeah?
Uh, throw my legs up in the air?
Uh, don’t you wanna pull my hair?
Take ‘em off, baby take ‘em off!

Let me pull only boy shorts
You gotta play to win, no play for sports
Wrap this on, you gotta be a big boy!
You make me scream and shout
Throw me a pillow if I get too loud
But I gotta protect my crown
So you better... your mouth!
No hands, look, daddy, no hands!
Put me.. see me.. in your pants
The way your body moves feel just like a dance

Put on your pump um shots…
Sexy on the air, when you step upon the showa
Hot in your pump um shorts…

Put ‘em on, you could take ‘em off!
Put ‘em on, you could take ‘em off!
I put ‘em on, you could take ‘em off!
You could take ‘em off, baby take ‘em off!

Girl you are… my time
Every time you’re passing your pump um shorts
I put ‘em on, you could take ‘em off
Girl, …
Every time you’re passing your pump um shorts
Uh, don’t you wanna see me yeah?

…put on your pum pum…
Sex in the air when you step…

Chorus:
Uh, don’t you wanna see me yeah?
Uh, throw my legs up in the air?
Uh, don’t you wanna pull my hair?
Take ‘em off, baby take ‘em off!
