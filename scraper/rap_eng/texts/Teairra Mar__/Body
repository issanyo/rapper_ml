Head Shoulders Knees Toes .. Hey

[Verse 1:]
Shifting Through My Clothes
Tryna Pick What I'll Put On Tonight
Oh Tonight
Find Something That'll Make Me
Feel Like A Lady And I'm Sure
It's Gonna Catch Your Eye
Oh And All Night

[Chorus]
From My
Head Shoulders Knees Toes
To My
Head Shoulders Knees Toes
My Pretty Body Body
You Gon Want This Pretty Body Body
Tonight .. Tonight
Ain't Disappoint When Our
Breakup Came To Full View
Check Out My Body
While I'm Walking To My New Boo
Tonight .. Tonight
You Gon Want This Pretty Body

[Verse 2]
You Can Kick Back And
Just Watch All Night
I Don't Want Your Hello
I Don't Need Your Good Bye
Just Watch Me (watch me)
The New Girl Is So Not Me

[Chorus]
From My
Head Shoulders Knees Toes
To My
Head Shoulders Knees Toes

You Gon Want This Pretty Body Body
Tonight .. Tonight
Ain't Disappoint When Our

[Hook]
Look But Don't Touch
You Can Look
But Don't Touch
My Boyfriend's Here
You Can Look
But Don't Touch
You Used To Act As If You Ain't It
So I Made The Decision To Move On
But Just For The Hell Of It
I'll Send You A Picture
I'll Write You A Love Note
So You Can Remember Me Sayin
Look At Look At Look At Me
Look At Look At Look At This
Look At What You Coulda Had
Look At What You'll Never Get

[Chorus]
Head Shoulders Knees Toes
(what you'll never get)
Head Shoulders Knees Toes
Look At What You'll Never Get

Breakup Came To Full View
