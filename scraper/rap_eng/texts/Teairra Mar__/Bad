[Verse 1]
Wanna quit you, but I just can't find the strength (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Stay on my mind more than anyone thinks (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
I know that you're no good for me, no good for me
You be bringin' out the hood in me, the hood in me
It was cool at first, but then you kept me off my game
[?] had your people sayin' things
Now I know it was partially my fault (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Had to walk away to see what they was tellin' me
Yo' ass was no good for me!

[Hook]
Seems like everything I want, I know it's bad for me
Had to give it up, I did it happily
Sometimes I can feel it comin' back to me
But I ain't 'bout to double back
Hit me, I ain't holla-in' back
Everything I want, I know it's bad
Had to switch it up, do things I never had
Ain't gonna lie, sometimes I want you bad
But I ain't 'bout to double back
Hit me, I ain't callin' back
Everything I want, I know it's bad!
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Yeah, bad for me
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Everything I want, I know it's bad!
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Yeah, bad for me
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)

[Verse 2]
Caught me at my lowest
Usually when I started losin' focus
You said you was ready for the long road
And I had to smarten up and tell you "Hell no, hell no!"
You just want a bitch, someone you can control
I ain't with the shits, I ain't 'bout it, oh no!
Went and told my friends, "I'm done, ain't 'bout to need no one!"
Had to get back to the basics, all of this time I've been wastin'!
Now I know it was partially my fault (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Had to walk away to see what they was tellin' me
Yo' ass was no good for me!

[Hook]
Seems like everything I want, I know it's bad for me
Had to give it up, I did it happily
Sometimes I can feel it comin' back to me
But I ain't 'bout to double back
Hit me, I ain't holla-in' back
Everything I want, I know it's bad
Had to switch it up, do things I never had
Ain't gonna lie, sometimes I want you bad
But I ain't 'bout to double back
Hit me, I ain't callin' back
Everything I want, I know it's bad!
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Yeah, bad for me
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Everything I want, I know it's bad!
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
Yeah, bad for me
(Everything is bad, everything is bad)
