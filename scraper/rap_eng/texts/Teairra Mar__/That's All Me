[Verse 1: Teairra Mari]

Been searching and i finally found
Someone who could cure all my lonely
Won't let you go no way boy no how
I'ma need you as my one and only
You've got me helpless, call me selfish I don't care
Long as I got you I'm alright baby
And I can't help that I'm so happy when you're there
I won't let no one have what's all mine, yeah

[Chorus]

Love, I ain't never gonna give you back your love
So if you give it to me babe
Just know I play for keeps
She ain't never gonna get none of your love
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me

[Verse 2: Teairra Mari]

So long since I've felt this way yeah
I can't stop from smiling
But you know all the right things to say
Can't stop my fingers from dialing
You got me helpless call me selfish I don't care
Long as I got you I'm alright, baby
And I can't help that I'm so happy when you're there
I won't let no one have what's all mine, yeah

[Chorus]

Love, I ain't never gonna give you back your love
So if you give it to me babe
Just know I play for keeps
She never gonna get none of your love
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me
Love, I ain't never gonna give you back your love
She never gonna get none of your love
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me

[Verse 1: Rico Love]

Yeah, I been had skills, Ciroc spills
Hard power automobile
Plus a couple of mill
But Shawty so chill, with the whip of pill
Got the snap back so I'm loving how I feel
Hard to figure me, spending figures out of Italy
Ph anthem, so I bought the little [?] with the big seats
These little niggas tickle me
Tryna getâ€¦ till my Shawty, she gonna stick with me
And know I ain't no rnb dude
But I rule rnb I make rnb cool
Big boy budgets, rnb moves
How she not 'gone choose, but all of these jewels
Fuck is you

I ain't never gonna give you back your love
Just know I play for keeps
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me
I ain't never gonna give you back your love
She never gonna get none of your love
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me
Just know I play for keeps
She never gonna get none of your love
So you better tell her baby
That that's all me
Love, love, love, love
