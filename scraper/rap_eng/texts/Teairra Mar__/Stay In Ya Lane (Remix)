(Darkchild:) Another Dark Child classic
(Streetz:) uh huh….Streetz & Young Deuces…..EMP…Teairra Marie
(Teairra:) Just Stay in ya Lane

(Streetz Verse:)
Shorty Wanna go shoppin
I just copped a new coupe for her to plop in
Thatz how we rockin
Don't slam doors mami
This ain't yourz mami
Put you on timeout like you ain't did yo chores mami
Hom-o-cide I kill da streets, I'm on FIRE!!
Young boy conceal da heat, you want a RIDAH
Well you need to holla at me
You starin don't change a thing mami, stay in ya lane, HOLLAA

(Verse 1:)
Yes I, got a tight crew
So, yes I know what these jeans are doing to ya
Yes you, like how we move but
Just be careful, we don't start clowning you
Yes I, might give you a chance if your game is times four (four)
Might give you the sell if your backseat sits four (four)
Until I do
Respect my whole crew
And stay in your lane

(Chorus:)
I see you baby
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
You want me, but be easy
So look upon me, just stay in ya lane

(Verse 2:)
Yes we, came in five coups
So, just be easy, its the first time I met you
Yes, we're particular too
So, watch your mouth
Or bottles are flying at you
Yes I, came to play around and shut this place down
As fine as I am, I can't take this route
If your mouth is loose
You're with the wrong crew
We're gon' handle you

(Chorus:)
I see you baby (Ohhhh)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy (Take it easy yeah)
Keep getting at me
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
My frame is crazy (So crazy)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy (Easy)
You want me, but be easy
So look upon me, just stay in ya lane

I see you baby ('cause me and my girls came to have a good time baby)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
Keep getting at me (And we don't need nobody getting out and poppin, thinking they're hot, just stop it)
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
My frame is crazy (I know you like what you see, but stay in your lane please)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
You want me, but be easy (And I'm not gonna tell you no more)
So look upon me, just stay in ya lane

(Bridge:)
I'm not really trying to play you
But certain things I can't tolerate (tolerate)
Like a nigga up in my face (in my face)
I really need my space so
I'll show you how you can get through
And most important stay in your lane
But you really can't play these games with me (Ohh)

(Young Deuces Verse:)
Listen shorty u can tell yo use to dealin wit lames
You must be out cha mind if you really think im da same

(Chorus:)
I see you baby (I see you baby)
But stay in your lane (Over there looking at me, but you're acting crazy)
Take it easy
Keep getting at me (And i Know you don't know me)
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy (So my nigga please)
My frame is crazy (You ain't seen no chicks like these)
But stay in your lane

You want me, but be easy (You better stay in your lane)
So look upon me, just stay in ya lane (Ohh)
