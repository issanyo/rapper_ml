[Verse 1]
Its not okay for you to go missing for days
Call your cellphone go straight to voice mail
No fair, cause if I did it to you
You'd probably think I was fucking with another dude

Okay, okay
So what the sex good?
But I could find another, no problem I look good
On me, on me, on me (on meee) yeaaa!

[Chorus]
You make it so uneasy
For me to love you baby (yeaa)
You make it so uneasy
For me to trust you baby (yeaaa)
You make it so uneasy for me to love you baby yea
You make it so uneasy for me to trust you baby
Yeaaa

[Bridge]
Cause you always lying, lying
Why can't you ever keep it official (ficial)
You never around me when I need you (need you)
You make it uneasy for me
You make it uneasy uneasy for me
[repeat]

[Verse 2]
Seven days later call back but
I'm bout to do you how you do me; don't answer
Fix yo ass
Sit yo ass down
Learn a lesson bout love
Cause its not enough to tell me
Gotta show me whats up

Okay, okay so what?
The sex good
I can find another
No problem I look good
On me, on me, on me, on meeeee!

[Repeat (Chorus & bridge)]

Ooooo to love you baby
Ooooo, to trust you baby
Ooooo, to need you baby
Mmmmm!

You're making it uneasy
You're making it uneasy
You're making it
Uneasy for meee ohhh!

[Chorus]

For me to love you babyy
For me to trust you baby yeaa
Ohhh for me to love you
Ohh oh whooaa!

[Chorus]

Ah ah ah-ooo
Ah ah ah-oooooo
Ah ah ah haaa!

Ah ah ah ah-ooo
Ah ah ah-ooooo
Ah ah ah haa
