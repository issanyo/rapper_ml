[Intro:]
Another Dark Child classic
Teairra
What's up?
Talk to em, talk to em
Whatchu want?
Talk to em, talk to em

You gotta come up with a better game than that
Talk to em, talk to em
You know what?
Just stay in ya lane
Let's go

[Verse 1:]
Yes
I got a tight crew
So, yes
I know what these jeans are doing to ya
Yes
You like how we move
But just be careful
We don't start clowning you

Yes
I might give you a chance
If your game is times four (four)
Might give you the sell
If your backseat sits four (four)
Until I do
Respect my whole crew and stay in your lane

[Chorus:]
I see you, baby
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
But stay in your lane

I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
You want me, but be easy
So look upon me
Just stay in ya lane

[Verse 2:]
Yes
We came in five coups
So just be easy
It's the first time I met you
Yes, we're particular too
So watch your mouth
Or bottles are flying at you

Yes
I came to play around and shut this place down
As fine as I am
I can't take this route
If your mouth is loose
You're with the wrong crew
We're gon' handle you

[Chorus:]
I see you baby
(Oh)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
(Take it easy, yeah)
Keep getting at me
But stay in your lane

I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
(So crazy)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
(Easy)
You want me, but be easy
So look upon me
Just stay in ya lane

I see you, baby
(Cause me and my girls came to have a good time, baby)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
(And we don't need nobody getting out and popping
Thinking they're hot, just stop it)
But stay in your lane

I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
(I know you like what you see
But stay in your lane, please)

But stay in your lane
Take it easy
You want me
But be easy
(And I'm not gonna tell you no more)
So look upon me
Just stay in ya lane

[Bridge:]
I'm not really trying to play you
But certain things I can't tolerate
(Tolerate)
Like a nigga up in my face
(In my face)
I really need my space, so

I'll show you how you can get through
And most important stay in your lane
But you really can't play these games with me
(Oh)

Ho, ho, ho
Ho, ho, ho
Ho

[Chorus:]
I see you, baby
(I see you, baby)
But stay in your lane
(Over there looking at me, but you're acting crazy)
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
(And I know you don't know me)
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
(So my nigga, please)

My frame is crazy
(You ain't seen no chicks like these)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
(You better stay in your place)
You want me
But be easy
(You better stay in your lane)
So look upon me
Just stay in ya lane
(Oh)

I see you baby
But stay in your lane
(Your lane, take it easy)
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
(Oh)
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
(I ain't crazy)

My frame is crazy
(Yes, it is)
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
(You want me)
You want me
But be easy
(Be easy)
So look upon me
Just stay in ya lane

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Just stay in your lane
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Just stay in your lane
Just stay in your lane
