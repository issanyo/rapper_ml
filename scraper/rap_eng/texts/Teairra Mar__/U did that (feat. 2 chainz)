You did dat x4

I don't know which way I'm going
I can't tell my up right now from down
I'm 10 seconds from exploding
Captivated, trapped inside your sound
I'm feeling now ooo

And just when I thought no one can do it better, do it better, better
Better, better than him
They way you lay it down you're sexist, forcing me to stand corrected
And just when I thought I'd be opened forever, you went and made me forget
About him
I'm glad I showed him the exit, oh I swear boy

You did that, you did dat yeah x2

Got me permanently flowing
Like Marilyn Monroe in a night gown
Can't hide, my excitement showing
S***, beautiful beyond profound
Jump in, don't worry you won't drown

And just when I thought no one can do it better, do it better, better
Better, better than him
They way you lay it down you're sexist, forcing me to stand corrected

And just when I thought I'd be opened forever, you went and made me forget
About him
I'm glad I showed him the exit, oh I swear boy

You did that, you did dat yeah x2

Never thought this love could be a pain
That's cause I had nobody to compare to
Now I feel like he's just in the way
Ever since I went there with you
Never been so turned up, so turned out and turned on
I'm so glad he's gone, cause you're the one I want

And just when I thought no one can do it better, do it better, better
Better, better than him
They way you lay it down you're sexist, forcing me to stand corrected
And just when I thought I'd be opened forever, you went and made me forget
About him
I'm glad I showed him the exit, oh I swear boy

You did that, you did dat yeah x2
