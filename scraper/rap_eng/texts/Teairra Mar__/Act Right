(Verse 1:)
Do you
Do you have any idea what you do, do
So on point you make a liar
Tell the truth, truth
And on the low the hood is buzzin over you
But baby I got ya
I'm talking square, biz (biz)
I'm too cool to be glowin like this (this)
After only a movie and a kiss

(Hook:)
Baby you're the one (Yeah)
Its all much too much (Yeah)
But I can't get enough
I promise to stay in pocket

(Chorus:)
Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right
If I put my money on you every time
I know I'd bet right
Checkin my call log
To see if I missed your call
While I was in the shower (Boy you got that)
Boy you got that act right
The way you love me
I swear that its a life changer
If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper
Don't know what to do with you
OD'in over you
But I think I like it (Oh)
Boy you've got that

(Verse 2:)
Oh, oh, look at me
I'm out of control ('trol)
Cell phone is dead so
I'm going to the corner store, store
To check my voice mail on the pay phone
Hope you left a message
Baby you're out cold, cold
Wanna say you're the shi-
But boy you're much more, more
What the streets call the reason

(Hook:)
Baby you're the one (yeah)
Its all much too much (yeah)
But I can't get enough
I promise to stay in pocket

(Chorus:)
Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right (You got it)
If i put my money on you every time (Boy I know I would)
I know I'd bet right

Checkin my call log (I'm checkin)
To see if I missed your call
While I was in the shower (Oh)
Boy you got that act right
The way you love me
I swear that its a life changer (It'd change a life, yeah)
If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper (Taking all my paper)
Don't know what to do with you
ODin over you
But I think I like it (Yes I am baby)
Boy you've got that

(Bridge:)
Ohh
Never thought a hood chick (Never thought I could)
Could feel like I do (Feel this way, oh yeah)
Writing to the sky boy about you
In the daytime with a flashlight looking for you
Oh baby, baby (oh baby baby baby baby)
Ohh
Never thought a hood chick
Could feel like I do (I put that on everything that I own)
Writing to the sky boy about you
In the daytime with a flashlight looking for you (Oh baby you've got me looking for you)

(Chorus:)
Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right (Oh my, you've got it)
If I put my money on you every time (If I put my money down)
I know I'd bet right
Checkin my call log (Did I miss it)
To see if I missed your call
While I was in the shower (The other room and I didn't hear it)
Boy you got that act right
The way you love me
I swear that its a life changer (I swear, I swear)
If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper (Yes you would)
Don't know what to do with you
ODin over you
But I think I like it
Boy you've got that

Oh my, you got the thang to make a girl wanna act right
If I put my money on you every time
I know I'd bet right
Checkin my call log
To see if I missed your call
While I was in the shower
Boy you got that act right
The way you love me
I swear that its a life changer
If I was a dude, homie you would get all my paper
Don't know what to do with you
ODin you
But I think I like it
Boy you've got that
