Teairra, I want you ma, can we do this
Can I trust you?

If I take it off
Would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, if I come off of this loving
Its confidential
If I take it off
Would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, if I come off of this loving
Its confidential

If I (If I)
Let you get me (Let you, let you)
Take off my jeans (Let you, let you)
You're gonna be
The first one to score
And if I let go (Let go, let go)
Act irresponsible (Oh no, oh no)
After all this is over
Will the joke be on me

Though my body's saying (take me)
I got my mind saying (same thing)
Slow down, don't be fooled, by the things you say

If I take it off
Would you take it slow (Oh)
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know)
About nothing, if I come off of this loving (Its so confidential)
Its confidential
If I take it off
Would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know, oh)
About nothing, if I come off of this loving
Its confidential

I'm so close to giving you all of me
But I can't be sure that you gon' stay with me
I know that I said that we were meant to be
But I can't say this time and its right for me
Your swagger is right our vibe is strong
You're beggin' to see me with nothing on
So many of my girls are home alone
Wishing that they would have remained strong

Though my body's saying (take me)
I got my mind saying (same thing)
Slow down, don't be fooled, by the things you say

If I take it off
Would you take it slow
And promise to not let nobody know (Promise that you won't betray me)
About nothing, if I come off of this loving (No, its so confidential)
Its confidential
If I take it off
Would you take it slow (No)
And promise to not let nobody know (Nobody know)
About nothing, if I come off of this loving (Woah, its so confidential)
Its confidential

I like you
I mean, (Nothing, loving)
I really like you
I just don't know (Nothing, loving)
If I'm ready
If I take it off
Would you take it slow (You feel me)
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing, loving (You willing to wait?)
If I take it off would you take it slow (Huh)
And promise to not let nobody know
About nothing (nothing), if I come off of this loving
Its confidential
