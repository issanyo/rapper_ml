[Verse One: Kanye West]
Aye, Aye, Uh
You love my diamonds don't ya
Love the way a nigga shinin' don't you
Baby what's your dis-position?
Have you ever tried this position?
You my dream girl from the posters
That I thought I would never get close to
In the back limousines with chauffeurs
Right next to the Testarossas
It's funny how all the jewelery
Just gets your cat so purry
And it look good altogether
They say they all forever
You love my diamonds don't ya
That I bought from all this rhymin'
But I know you'll never love me
You'll only love my diamonds

[Hook]
When I love baby
I'm gonna love ya, just like I love my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
And when I wake up every night
(Boooooooy)
Will we be shining
Diamonds, Diamonds
I treasure you
Cherish you
When you rub my body
(oooooooohhhh)
Cause people are together
Diamonds are forever
Ice blue baby
(oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds

[Verse 2]
Like every girl
I'm into fabulous things
Like oyster pearls, and pretty diamond rings
But you're my precious possession
I rock you 24/7
I do (I do), I do (do)
All my accessories, yea I'll give em' up
I'd even trade them in for your love
And the ain't no way
I'm giving you away
You're my d-d-diamond daddy
And I just got to have you

[Bridge]
You sexy, you Fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind
You sexy, you fine
I'm so glad your mine
You sexy, you fine
He's my one of a kind

[Hook: Repeat x2]
(oooooooohhhh)
When I love you like my diamonds
Diamonds, Diamonds
(When I love you baby)
