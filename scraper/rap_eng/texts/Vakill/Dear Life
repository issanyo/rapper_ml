(Verse 1)
The 21st of March the God's born
But abnorm with an angelic-shape eye form
Armspan like the Wings of Love of Jeffrey Osborne
Pierced the earth from the afterbirth of a meteorite
Spittin' Pedialyte media hype
[?] as the second coming seed of your life
Mach-5 thoughts exceeding your light
Braincells are G-4 modem
With built-in encyclopedia-bytes
In high definition, being a flow or graffiti writer
It's like I was conceived in the projects
Where Satan harbors heat
Give him twelve jewels in case the lava leaks
Taught you either starve or eat
Kings get to carve the meat
And the crown don't move 'til the god touch the barber's seat
Raised by my earthen convicts, that'd never solve a sentence
Project hallways that was all scented with piss and aerosol linen, shit
I tear wipe with the same hand used to hold the edges of this here knife called dear life

(Hook) x2
The funny thing about life
Is nobody gets out it of alive
So how the hell you gon' tell me how to survive
What does the whole purpose lead to
And why should I believe you
When you can bleed too

(Verse 2)
While our world leaders handshake and mandate man's fate
I exist to move bowels in the batter of your pancakes
Flip shit food for thought supplement it
We a couple of minutes from the dragon's beheadin'
Brag when we getting some dime piecebitch trim
And deep dish rims with a sheepish grin
What's it worth when the shit that's sweet switch scrims
Spit gems with heat in a complete re-blend
Love is a folklore that provokes war
The streets ditch friends six feet stitched in
We cheat death like switching stickers on the Rubik's cube
Instead of solving the puzzle
Die when our aspirations dissolve in a puddle
In the wake of commotion
Cos ambition is the fragile ice on a lake of emotion
And you wonder why niggas don't really act right
And blood money ain't blood money unless it's hemophiliac-type
And fuck worrying about dollar bills
We paranoid at every Middle-Easterner with a full beard and Jallah Bill
And r'n'b icons indicted for statutory
Video taping themselves
Running up in the snatch of shorties
My consciousness will never reach a happy camper settlement
Cramped intelligence with alcohol
But still not enough to hamper elegance
Even if I bought a 24-pack and killed the whole case like tampered-evidence
And in spite of that shit
The right of passage to move units is whether I sell dope or not
What the f------

(Hook) x2

The funny thing about life
Is nobody gets out it of alive
So how the hell you gon' tell me how to survive
What does the whole purpose lead to
Why should I believe you
When you can bleed too
