[Vakill]
Vakill..

[Verse 1]
I'm a harbinger of death with a flow otherworldly
Cancer cluster that wasn't discovered early
Shittin on you 'til your body covered thoroughly
My quotes cockblock throats
'Til MC's unable to respond
Like I just told a homeless person a knock knock joke
Malicious; tattooed F.U.N. on my dick
For "Fuck You Niggas" while I poke fun at yo' bitch
Leavin spitters missin vowels, shitters disemboweled
The last one you clearly wouldn't doubt
Niggas won't consider dissin now
Fuck punchlines and metaphors; I settle wars
Spittin darts 'til puncture wounds look like an extra set of pores
I'm morally sick and auspicious, all vicious
Quick to jaw bitches 'til they chin hit the ground like drawbridges
Potnah, yo' whole style Ichabod Crane
I'm leavin all you riders headless when I squeeze off these Sleepy Hollows
And pick apart brains, blow to smidgens
My shit on point like infrared scopes strapped on the ass of homing pigeons

[Scratched]
"It ain't nothin.." "It's simple ain't it? But quite clever"
"I'm the sickest"

[Verse 2]
I came lyrically known as the most foul clinic
Biochemist spittin' a mutated AIDS virus
Puttin niggas careers on cryogenics
I math with godly wrath when it go all
Like pinocchio eatin' pussy while he takin' a polygraph
I'm bane on some angioplasty shit
Just fuck you out of the frame into your nasty bitch
Spit epic novels evil and episcopal
Fuck your respect, I done dropped two singles and already my rep is gospel
In this world of cutthroats
I'm a midget with a scalpel and a non remorseful grin
Circumsizin' everything below the torso skin
You fuckin' with the only one in the wet t-shirt contest with a dorsel fin
I spit fire faggots and fart in a flame
Backstabber, but I'm terribly takin part in a plan
Give a fuck whatever, if your ironing it, throw the book at me
I'm throwin' it back full of pubic hairs with the pages stuck together
I nut on CDs and shit on tapes
Far as vinyl, I'm the last cat you wanna see workin at a fast food joint
To grasp at our plates, none sicker
Sworn revenge like a driveby car with a rainbow bumper sticker
I'm lettin off a thick cream blast
Til the whole planet is sleepin in a wet spot with a well reamed ass
While you playin dreamcast and suckin so many of these rap niggas dicks
Your mouths starting to look like a Scream mask

Hook 2x

[Verse 3]
I'm sick by design shorty because I shine jewelry
With blind fury, the underground assigned jury
Try to accuse me of being too jiggy and shit
Disregarding the fact that I'm like christlike nice with mass purely
Draw me with thorns and a bracelet to match
I'm matter but known to make car stereos and niggas faces detach
Quintessentially dark intregal, poisonous tipster
Heart wrinches, spit ink like I was anatomically part tentacle
Subliminal Vakill disses echo past ya
While I squeeze off til your fucking dosely echo plaster
Code malice streets got my soul callous
But I'm nice like twelve deciples
Sip my blood from a dope chalice, shit
My worst effort is madness in reverse method
Shittin' with a jamaican work ethic til this game bitch unfold
And niggas grip my nuts so tight
I don't know whether to spin or tap out the self-'gnition code

Hook 2x
