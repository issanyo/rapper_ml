[Verse One] [Copywrite]:
How isn't he finished?
He's limitless, infinite, endless
Get him he's fixin' to mix his disc and the shit's gonna end us
I wife the pit, if life's a bitch, then you're impotent in this
Isn't a synonym meant for him in the system of English
Went independent again
Forget the majors
You black out, I'm Liquid Paper
Forget your day job at a crack house of different strangers
Your kids in danger and I max out on bitches faces who lick and taste it
Ewww
No argument of course she does
You wanna battle Pete and force the buzz
With a left field beef that's horse shit cuz
Especially before the last thing you do is diss
But now you got the nerve on a song like Courtney Love
Legend with a cult followin'
That's why your broad is soft swallowin'
Sippin' my malt to gulp all it in
One million consumers, bought a saw from him
I fought all of them
Shook you on some grown man shit, adult modeling
J.K
I don't own an A.K., but got some bread
You couldn't crack 2 G's unless you dropped an egg
You couldn't crack 2 G's if you dropped an album
The mom and pop shops are out 'em cause you bought your mom a thousand
Ambiens and Somas are mean enough to put Bambi in a coma
Then serve deer meat while his family is over
I'm who your mamma needs to bone cause my boner make of holes so huge
You known dude can anatomically indulge her

[Chorus]:
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep - Dr. Octagon 'Blue Flowers'
Flat line
Delete beep beep beep
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep

[Verse Two] [Vakill]:
I write shit to make badges and nightsticks riot
With a crowd that's Jena 6 bias
My struggle so Genesis cry it
My pennin' is fire
A sick science that sic lions
On infants, a strict diet
Of "Shut The Fuck Up And Sit Quiet"
Hope the supreme high bless ya
Who you gon' find 16's by fresher?
The echelon of extreme fly measure
My pleasure confine to a dream by pressure
The day you intervenin' between my treasures
Is the day I cream pat Precious
With a ?
As the ring set and lies beneath
Where I'm from, death don't fraternize with sleep
I'm where papers are passed proud like cash bribes
Schooled by the old heads
Never bet on old horses and fast brides
And flash lives in front of niggas faces they grab knives
So I uploaded weapons like my straps is on flash drives
Why you're yearly promoting market heaters
When I solidified my spot first quarter
Broke fuckin' parking meter

[Chorus]:
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
Flat line
Delete beep beep beep
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
Flat line
To your heartbeat, delete beep beep beep
