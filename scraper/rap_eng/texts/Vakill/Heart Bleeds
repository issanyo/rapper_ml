[Verse 1]
Son of an alcoholic, son of a minister
Son of a bitch with bad intentions, some of 'em sinister
Some of 'em good, meant well, but plans backfired
Fuck peaceful solutions, they shoot? Return back fire
Sorry moms, even God took a day to rest
I'm a settle this shit, so just, look away, I guess
I took a tiny ride
And sprayed up the hoagie shop of that bastard that upset you in ninety five
And I didn't give two fucks who was in it or not
And I didn't stick around for another minute to watch
If it's drama I'mma pull that thing out the dash and settle
Fuck flashing metal, I'mma squeeze off and mash the pedal
Don't fuck with my money, moms and music
Nah, fuck the money and music
You fucking with moms alone, I'mma lose it
Apparently he wasn't focused
Now that's the reason he sent that letter of apology and a dozen roses

[Chorus]
My heart bleeds for no man
Unless he's willing to bleed for me
Kill if needed be
That's just the way that the creature be
Bitch, I was born the last of a dying breed, a G

[Verse 2]
Coming up, you was know as that nigga in the fam
That probably wouldn't hesitate to squeeze a trigger in a jam
You was bigger than I am, so I always looked up to you
Had each others back when adversary shook up the crew
[?] and we mourned like you was [?]
When you was moving work and [?] I'm writing them bars
Got knocked and was forced to reform, writing them bars
Page after page, weathered the storm, fighting them odds
When a nigga touched down, didn't notify his kin
The same prison made him callous and immortified his skin
Spent his childhood locked in the system
Came home and looked at us like we was plotting against him
That's some bitch act type
And your whole fucking memory went pitch black, right?
I ain't put a gat to your head and tell you "pitch that white"
And since you feel you're too fly for your own blood, shit, better switch that flight

[Chorus]
My heart bleeds for no man
Unless he's willing to bleed for me
Kill if needed be
That's just the way that the creature be
Bitch, I was born the last of a dying breed, a G

[Verse 3]
When the world blows up and the last shell falls
'Til I recieve the lords last cell call
My life story's an open tell-all
And page after page is fuck you
Got rage pent-up like pussy pictures on cell walls
They say opposites attract, life's short
So I stack my [?]
I'm a loaded question followed by 'hell naw'
Slowing your progress to a snail's crawl
A nigga that'll squeeze 'til your screams' just echo going through hell's halls
Lost two of my niggas near dear to heart
A year apart, before I even gave this career a start
If you don't know pain, you can't tell me shit
If you never suffered losses than your heart knows no scars
Steady spitting those homo bars
The game's a bunch of gay gangstas, a bunch of faggot flow Omars
And I'mma leave 'em all dismembered this year
Remember this here
Give a fuck who's the hottest, 'cause all temperatures [?]
