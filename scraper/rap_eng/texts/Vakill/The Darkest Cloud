[Verse 1]
I prayed to God for his blessing to consent slaughter
Your seven ounces of brain holds two percent water
Literally, your dry ideas belong under your armpits
Fully armed spit, my palm slick with this engraved
Vakill, in quotations, "the nicest", after I come fuck this liquid Hell
Only hoes that's giving head is getting floatation devices
Digest words to kill by, autopilot my technique
So even if I sleep on my own shit, it's still fly
I'm God's only begotten renegade angel, saint sinner, make anemic hemmorhage
I can draw a graphic scenic image with paint thinner
Let the bullshit stop 'til it screech with hot lead
I beseech hip-hop heads 'til the tooth brush is obsolete
Meaning fuck around and catch a reach flip-top head, I set respectable trends
Tell the sickest emcees blueprint my testicle skin
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks to your chin

[Hook]
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud shall rain the rest of your natural life span
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud!

[Verse 2]
I voice a oral crucifixion with a mouth full of nine inch nails
Conceptually blazing it trails, with your skeletal remains and entrails
In pales, snug and cushy, my hip-hop status is c-section (why?)
Cause I'm a cut above you pussies
My DNA splice with a Japanese feudal lord
Brutal sword lacerations with impartial rhymes
Keep a bitch that's a 10, pimping's like Farrakhan with cerebral palsy
I can start a million march of dimes
Significant severed uncertain signs
Salivating circles around cyphers of a venomous serpent kind
Dizzying bitches, murking niggas, grizzly and vicious
'Til they minus Flesh-N-Bone like Layzie, Krayze, Bizzy and Wish's
Who the sickest shitting this year?
And your continuation of breathing all depends on how good is the answers
Fuck up and the judge will sentence me so many times
You'll have to indent this shit and put it in stanzas

[Hook]
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud shall rain the rest of your natural life span
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud!

[Verse 3]
I don't talk shit, I give shit a second language
You ass-betting in dyslexic Spanglish, hope for the best but expect the anguish
Presently, sleepers dying pissed off
And my sole solution for the chronic bedwetting is electric blankets
My diatribe murks entire tribes
I'm the thirteenth ghost from drama's future
So when I make the alphabet perform Karma Sutra
The English language'll have to be staple stitched back together with
Stainless steel armored sutures
Drunken word techniques fermented into tequila liquor
Shit bananas with a peel and a Chiquita sticker
Heat a clip up, shush kids to sleep
Spitting Korean entrepreneur flows that push wigs to eat
Illuminous whip, darkest cloud cumulous thick
Shrap numerous cliques, cancer tumor is sick
Nickel slick, quick humorous spit
Liquid sword salivation 'til throats of every consumer is slit
Shit, in a recessive state my flows are ego spectacle
If I was born with one nut, I'd still be ego-testicle
And niggas shit-popping more instead of worth they weight
Can't hold a fucking candle to me with Bob Hope's birthday cake
I've enhanced the Jordan rules
Putting bodies on the Mike and watch the flyest nigga leap to his death
If the name of my profession is "fuck you"
Then basically what I'm trying to say is... never mind, my work speaks
For itself

[Hook]
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud shall rain the rest of your natural life span
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud!
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud shall rain the rest of your natural life span
Bow down to a entity none of y'all nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in the mic stand
Your fight plan's now in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud!
