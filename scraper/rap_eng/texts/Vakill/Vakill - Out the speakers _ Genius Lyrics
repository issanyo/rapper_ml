(Verse 1 Vakill)

I roast niggas till they beg me change the subject
I write, arrange and publish
Brains in the street at point blank range in public
When I spit a round, like a semi-auto with a queasy clip
Meeting earl, leaving your back open like a hospital gown
You better bite more than The Lox to beat me
Who you fucking with been nice, since Christ was on a box of Wheaties
Let bitches ass cheeks peeled apart
Got pussy falling from the heavens, don't know whether to fuck or build an Ark
Dragging his dicks, the antagonist (?) dragon fisted with a .44 mag and a biscuit
With no religious, ethnic or racial exception
Squeezing off on niggas, with a nut busting facial expression
You're a monopoly house in a volcano vicinity
I ain't got shit to lose, except unlike you, my anal virginity
Let Juice catch bodies and I'm gonna catch the bitch
My trigger finger got a bad case of crabs now who wanna scratch the itch?

(Verse 2)

Ey Va, they got problems I decapitate the limits
This is limitless
Juice is here, evacuate the premeses
Bored and metaphorical, my lyrics paint images
I'm the one, they getting practice
Niggas just don't scrimmage with
On the charge of being funky
The corp found you innocent
I hope your little part-time jobs got good benifits
In a sense, I'm the cat they've never should've went against
Spin at this to make your momma break down and reminisce
If rap was the bible, I ain't got you during genesis
If silence to the lambs, then emcee's can lose some skin in this
Moment baselines, pumps like adranaline
The type to set a battle of while eating lunch and vinegans
Like being in a movie, the audience is listening
I battle any rapper for the right amount of benjamins
Then again if niggas make have to get my pen again, I'm making sure we square the fuck off like NTM again

(Chorus 2x)

We've been ill as fuck since day one, nice as shit since day two
Battle crist and shot a fail on the third day too
Who fuckuing with Kill and (J you?) say who?

(Verse 3)

Aiyyo my rapper status is the baddest, what's your rapper status?
Who rapping baddest on this rapper baddest apparatus
Scared to kick my best flow, smoke you with a fast one
Each song's a little bit doper than the last one
My right hook is awkward
If i hit em' Imma mangle em'
Like Prince Naseem
I'm just trying to get a angle in
I'm juice and let you play them roles, but you can't hang with em'
Have niggas seeing double, like "damn there's a gang of em'"
Va, I think the whole world is lacking this profection
Are we just some products of the immaculate conception?
I drink gin I just got another dose in me
So nice I just won an award for "most friendly"
If there is a greater emcee, his refrigerator's empty
Cause ain't never been no money that no niggas made against me
I never lose for me to get beat niggas are basin that's like the skinheads' having dinner with (?)

(Verse 4)

I'm more for mice, to the seas from morphodites
Virally effecting about 2 thirds of you bitch niggas in 1/4 of the dikespa
Till a deep pimp pack's a nation, while we lacks impatience
Scratching my nutsack while I'm pissing in the vacination, fucker
I sleep shit and eat where thugs nessul
Squeezing off hand shots
Till i slugs resul, you blood vessels
Conceptually used used (?)
Whoever bringing, they gotta be mentally challenged
Or either hashed to wrap pussy
I'm heated, prepare your region
As to religion, the bitches like ya'll and I'd better leave em', (?)
Or you can have a period bleeding, deforced to (?)
You already got one for in the grave, and the other went off, repeated
When the alpha let's lose
You're born to lose
Like a kid that only got L's in his fucking alphabet soups
God gave me brains in both heads
So everytime i masturbate, I'm a shocking genius
But vertain broken english, normally opion
You ain't gotta be 20/20 optically accurate to see when I get open your ass get occupied
I'm number one with the bullet hallowed inside
And a nine age dick, and proud of it, so nigga swallow my brag
