[Hook: Merciles] 2x
Bind torture kill, I murder
Never heard of helter skelter?
Now you will
Bunch of goddamn lunatics
Clicking up to do this shit
Goin' to war with the whole world
I'm getting close to fucking losing it
(I fuckin')

[Verse 1: Merciles]
Heading to the bottom of the dungeon
Chain him all up nobody hear nothin'
Put him in da bag, put him in da trunk
Light 'em all on fire, I don't give a fuck
(?) gotta get rowdy
Speakin' in tongues - Aleister Crowley
Son of the dragon, stickin' em up
Mutilate hater, covered in blood
Vlad the Impaler, needed to kill, givin' 'em burn
Listen to screams lookin' 'em burn
Out of my mind now that I got you drinkin' the blood
Nosferatu ready for murder
Give me your soul, sell it for cheap
Never get old, what do you want?
Lettin' 'em have it, castin' black magic
I'm getting it done regardless
I'm comin' to you from darkness
A psychopath lunatic on the purge, I just do this shit
I'm a man of my word and we some horrorcore kings
I'm spittin' fire, shapeshiftin' and spreadin' my dragon wings
I murder, dismember, remember the suicide letter
Detective can't put it together
How brutal, remember but everyone dies
I'm gathering pieces and making another type torture device
Scratching off names of the hitlist
You kill or be killed or you suffer
Still blastin' the sickness I scatter while in the middle of nowhere
Cause I motherfuckin':

[Hook: Merciles] 2x
Bind torture kill, I murder
Never heard of helter skelter?

Bunch of goddamn lunatics
Clicking up to do that shit
Goin' to war with the whole world

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
The .50 cal slashin' off flesh, my finger caress the trigger and your cranium split
The infamous Lord is relentless, there is no repentin' when I'm bodysnatchin' a bitch
Lord of vampire fulfill my desire, they come at the night and go searching for blood
Keep me a big bag of lemon in the trunk cause your decomposed body is smelly as fuck
Murdering nigga became an art, they call me Lord Picasso
The torture will get wretched-raw when I'm snortin' up lines of cocaine in my nostril
Uno, Dos, Tres, Cuatro of the teflons in you vato
You cannot keep with the flow Scarecrow the (?), you just rascal
Picco chain, I'm very insane and ultra hostile
Hit you with the lead lotto, that BLAY! yo thats my motto
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter from down under
When the Mossberg pump thump on your chest you feel the thunder
Scarecrow the apex predator, all competitors feel the wrath
Heartless, trickin' 'em (?) the war path blood bath
Hit a one and one and then go gunnin' on a nigga hunt
Think you safe, next thing you know: you wake up in my goddamn trunk
