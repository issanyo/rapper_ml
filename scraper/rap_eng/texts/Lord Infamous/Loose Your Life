You disrespect, you disrespect
You lose your life, you lose your life

You disrespect, (you diss the wrong crew)
We'll kill you (you might lose your life)

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous 'bout to go predator
(?) down
Like a Navy SEALs special I (?) and (?)
The .50 round ready to blow off your crown
Cram a pound of C-4 down your motherfuckin' mouth
Blow your ass to chump chump
Feed you to the wildlife by my bayou house
Watch me now, Scarecrow Myers, Lord Voorhees
I have executed more than D-Day land in fuckin' Normandy
Normally I get at with you formally
When I put foreign techniques up my torture
I'm performin' the
Empty out your torso, eat up every morsel
Motherfucker highway to hell I have me a porto
Lord is an immortal, (?) your head like orko
Do you wanna die tonight?
Now that was a rhetorical question

[Bridge: Lord Infamous]
I am the wicked ratchet black magic psychopath with a hatchet
Sometimes you can see my horns
When I'm snortin' this Thrax man
I am half demonic, half narcotics and part Jedi
Sometimes I just rot and get high with a fuckin' dead guy

You disrespect, you disrespect
You lose your life, you lose your life

You disrespect, (you diss the wrong crew)
We'll kill you (you might lose your life)

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
I brought (?) to pick up the pick axe and shovel to bury the body I severed
Come to the demonic rebell, it's Infamous pleasure to crank ya the Triple 6 measure
Dungeons inferno and lavas cannot compare to Hades level
Let me check my murder schedule, send six slugs into your mellow
Hello it's the Scarecrow, Rowdy Bounty Hunter from down under
Twisted wicked punisher punch out holes with the tommy gun
I'm on some Columbian, I think I get a million ones
AK Soze wanna play, Rocket launcher point blank range
Voices in my head rage, Oxycottons make 'em go away
Scarecrow in the pumpkin patch, practicing with machete blades
Go in the bathroom say Lord 3 times, see demonic reflections
Bitch that means I'm comin' to cut your body in six sections

[Bridge: Lord Infamous]
I am the wicked ratchet black magic psychopath with a hatchet
Sometimes you can see my horns
When I'm snortin' this Thrax man
I am half demonic, half narcotics and part Jedi
Sometimes I just rot and get high with a fuckin' dead guy
