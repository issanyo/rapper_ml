[Hook: Lord Infamous]
I got a gang full of goons that got shifts to do
But get full of that use and beat up niggas like you
I know some real life beasts that's deep in these streets
They get a call from me, they gonna give you a crease
I know some real sick fucks who stay on that dust
And they'll give you a touch for an adrenaline rush
I know some real damn fools who play with them tools
And they favorite pastime is bustin' niggas like you

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
My name is the Scarecrow, some say that I'm deranged
And if you come step in my slaughter house
I make sure that you not comin' out mane
I'm reppin' that Black Rain, bloody Memphis Clubhouse Click
Forever I claim Mafioso, bury bodies
I get with the bitches real quick
A menacing madness the murderer is Lord
And I'm comin' out real fuckin' slick
I'm doin' these niggas real dirty, man I shoot you in yo dick
Listen closely punk bitch, you don't want no parts of Rick
Come and get with these killers make you split yo own wrist
A tisket, a tasket, a head up in a basket
I got a whole lot of the weapons
And they up under my mattress
At yo fuckin' wake, they gonna have to close ya casket
I'm blastin' 44s and fives in four heads of you faggots
They cuffin' on yo hoe, nobody want that slushy trash shit
I'm strong on robbing weak ass niggas doin' all that flashin'
You pussy ass niggas if I catch you walkin' the streets
I'mma give you the tool
I'm sick at slaughterin' soft shell niggas like you

[Verse 2: II Tone]
My name is II Tone, this my life and not a show
When them barrels get the burnin' better run for cover hoe
Niggas rowdy cause they ready and they all about the paper
Cross the Click with the shit, push 'em off a sky scraper
Cause we all about bitches, dump 'em in ditches, never take a loss
Cause we bust em, bag em, drag 'em then they body gettin' tossed
Sacrifices since a soldier cause we know that they ain't real
I can look him dead up in his eye before he feel the steel
Burnin' ... bitch I break the law
I'm gon' show up and show out, never speak on what you saw
For you faggot motherfuckers think you gangsta as a fake
Dick in the booty ass niggas, shoot you ...
These niggas huffin' and puffin' because I'm speakin' the truth
Oh yeah you claimin' you gangsta so let it do what it do
I'm turnin' goons into goblins, in the M always mobbin'
For you niggas out here stuntin': you the first that we robbin'

[Verse 3: T-Rock]
Y'all about to piss me off and make me take it back to packin'
You talk the talk, my niggas walk the walk and make it happen
Come and test my fraction of assassins, we about that action
No time for ration, we kick in the door and get the blastin'
II Tone with the Glock and pull up to the block
It's where we stop at
I'mma leave 'em stressed out in a box with suit and tie and top hat
Niggas want they block back, react, run up on Rock and Scarecrow
I'm a new age feral strapped with hollows sharp as bow and arrow
Y'all people wanna be G, let's grill it, I'm the pressure baker
We (?) stretch you, leave you hooked on asperators
Won't hestitate to let off a shot and levitate ya
I leave 'em stankin' that's why they call me the defecator
Make sure you think this over before you decide to push me
Cause it ain't nothin' we would rather do than ride on rookies
Strapped out with fully's, I'm a dog and he finna fuck you pussies
Modern day menace like Tookie shawty don't (?)
