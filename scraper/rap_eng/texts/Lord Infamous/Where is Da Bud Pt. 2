Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up
Quickly, I reach for my chicken then I roll it up

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I feel the need fa the biggidy Bud Man, flick a flame then I take a puff
Life is kinda hazy when ya hittin the bag of indica
Niggas be thinkin the Scarecrow is gonna go crazy
The way I be cheifin that blink
Quarter ounce of Ink and a big ass banana leaf
See I feel the urge fa the motha fuckin herb
The cure is the herb, takin niggas to the curb
Word, top-crop why not? Motha fuckin chronic
The whole world is spinnin yo this shit is fuckin hypnotic
Bud smoke is like a killer, keepin that glass up in they chest
Killaz is rollin that blunt up with that motha fuckin budda bless
Grain, broccoli, tar sticks, yo my nigga
I can't forget the dutches, black clutches, stashes of fuckin onion
And if ya want all ya brain cells dead
Get you a bag of the Cambodia Red
Since I keep most of the bless on the track
I wanna know Blac, yo where the bud at?

[Hook]
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Called up the hook up wanna get a ounce of pine weed
Hoping that the narcotics don't creep up behind me
Can't have the one-timers takin' out the killers
Cause bitches be bustin a nigga because we be havin' the paraphernalia
We'll take out the bags to sack up the stash
Blowin on a mack joint of the Cuban hash
And when we hit that bitch we don't leave shit but ash
Now its time to hit the cut and make a little cash
All sold out I heard my hook up just got busted
Can't find the bud and I'm gettin real disgusted
Callin' up my homies tryin' to find a new connection
Lookin for the marijuana in every direction and
Most of muthafuckas don't wanna give a nigga a straight package
Other muthafuckas got the flake ass cabbage babbage
Lookin' for the niggas with the fat pregnant sacks
So yo black, yo black man, where da bud at?

[Hook]
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin' for the bud
