[Hook]
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Ain't nuthin' you can do wit' this
I'm brutal bitch!
I be the rootinest tootin'est
Shootin'est hootin'est
Hangin' coz ya split ya wrists
I'm cruel trick!
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Got a night scope and a beam on this I won't miss
The rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
They call me Lord Infamous
I'm Infamous!

[Verse 1]
Kickin' up this like a fuckin' cheetah
Infamous, I'm hungry as a hyena
Once I get up on the speaker
Lurkin' with the millimeter
Low down dirty, ruthless schemer
When I load this forty-fiva
Tear up lungs like emphysema
No you cannot catch a breather
I don't like your punkass either
Cannibalistic, a flesh eater
Psychic thoughts is up my reader
I says that you want this heater
Rippin' out yo goddamn peepers
Track 'em down like Jeepers Creepers
Crouching tiger, hidden reaper
Yeah I hate alotta people
When we start there is no sequel
Bitch you never ever equal
Black mamba, I'm very lethal
Hit you with the damn heat seeker
Plenty bodies, dig it deeper
High as fuck, I'm on this liters
Slanted like the tower Pisa
Lookin' like he want some beef-ah
I'mma leave you with a leaker
Keyser Soze the defeater
Low on dope, I need a re-up
Snort a fucking quarter key up
Start a avalanche, snort up a avalanche
Doin' the devil dance, goin' into a trance
Pray to the murder man, shoot some malevolence
Snort me a blast and watch it all blast

[Hook]
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Ain't nuthin' you can do wit' this
I'm brutal bitch!
I be the rootinest tootin'est
Shootin'est hootin'est
Hangin' coz ya split ya wrists
I'm cruel trick!
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Got a night scope and a beam on this I won't miss
The rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
They call me Lord Infamous
I'm Infamous!

[Verse 2]
BLAY!
I'm the Bloody Bloody Scarecrow
I'm from the demonic dimension
When it comes to Devil Shyt
I promise there's no competition
Enemies, they all retreat, I rip a opposition
Bitch you pay the penalty
You wanna come fuck with this pimpin'
Coke OZ's and fentanyl
Are my only source of nutrition
Crank the chainsaw, get the rippin'
Flesh is all over the kitchen
Did I mention: I will split yo cranium
You get the trippin'
Grip this pistol on my hip
Then give you some lead intervention
Nigga wanna test this gangsta
Seems he needs a position
Put this pistol to his chin
And pop his brains to the ceilin'
Run and hide and duck for cover
Once I get no hill in
Set his ass on flames
And leave him in the med killin'
(?) blastin' dilaudid shots
And morphine to heal pain
You went against the grain
Now you have to face the Black Rain
Sadistic and sick psychotic
Yes I need a tec mane
Cause I'm hangin' decomposed bodies
It ain't right mane

[Hook]
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Ain't nuthin' you can do wit' this
I'm brutal bitch!
I be the rootinest tootin'est
Shootin'est hootin'est
Hangin' coz ya split ya wrists
Im cruel trick!
I be the rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
Got a night scope and a beam on this I won't miss
The rootin'est, tootin'est
Shootin'est, hootin'est
They call me Lord Infamous
I'm Infamous!
