[Intro]
Yeah, Lord Infamous, Scarecrow
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
Yeah, this for all my niggas in the Kaotic Klique
Tres, man I had to do it, ya know I'm sayin'
Soze! Okay! Okay! BLAY! Rowdy Bounter Hunter
Lord is the Scarecrow
Lord nigga
Even I don't know

[Verse 1]
Scarecrow the savage, the master of deadliest talents, the bodies all over the palace
Enter the mind of the malice, knocking your equilibrium, my balance (?)
Two automatics that's spillin' your cabbage, the dead bodies rottin' all up in the attic
Catch you a package that's full of C4, do not go to the wake, do not open the casket
Mossberg is knockin' the top off your corpse so the Scarecrow is from the dark side of the force
Cry all you want, there's no time for remorse when the kerosene dip in your head with the torch
Practice deadly voodoo culture, feedin' bodies to the vulture
Have you seen the dead culture, Mind of Minolta
Some of the demons sell dope and everyday Lord overdosin'
Heavy doses smack you like a locomotive, mystical mojo potent
Hell gates open, then I enter in the killa dimension
Villain with precision, fingertip like scalpel, deep incision
Dropping the corpse in the murky abyss, it's the Triple 6 general Lord Infamous
Chew off your face and I cut off your dick, ram a broom stick with splinters right up in ya bitch
Maniac from the bloody Miss', bitch I do this shit
Been doin' this since you niggas was swimmin' 'round yo daddy balls trick

[Hook] 2x
There's three in me: Keyser, 'Crow, L-O-R-D
Skitzo personalities, I never know which one I be
And all of these niggas damn fools
I don't even know which one right now is rappin' on these tools

[Verse 2]
Black mamba mixed with box jellyfish toxins, carbine cartridge
Demonic military marchin', abolish every target
I'm from the dimension where even god cannot hear your cries
The ultimate opposer, some may call it Mafia Antichrist
Lyrical guillotine, remove your spleen, cut off your cap
Make your insides feel like lava with this .500 revolver
Seven deadly sins in flesh from Scarecrow, Keyser, death miser
Splatter your matter like a papaya, body in the dryer
Wicked twisted mystic sadistic horrific (?)
You may not know my true name, many cultures call me Hezekiah
Six star general of the underworld, crimson red pearl
Destroy every man-child, litte boy, wicked girl
Serial killer, bounty hunter, hobby: searchin' for a body
John Wayne Gacy, man I find bodies tasty
Evil as a motherfucker, cat-shit crazy
I search through the depths of hell to find you till you pay me

[Hook] 2x
There's three in me: Keyser, 'Crow, L-O-R-D
Skitzo personalities, I never know which one I be
And all of these niggas damn fools
I don't even know which one right now is rappin' on these tools
