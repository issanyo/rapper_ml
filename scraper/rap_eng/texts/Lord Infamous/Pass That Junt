[Hook]
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smokin' fat - smokin' fat - smokin' fat mack Indo
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
We smoke off the ink
We get blowed off the ink
We get fucked up
We takin' them hard pulls, hard pulls
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
You’ll get a wiff when you sniff up in the air
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Marijuana, chiefin' bl-izz-unts
Keepin' the Scarecrow way up in the rainbows
Ev'ry mornin' sippin' a quart
With the key of the weed in the punch bowl
Grab me a couple of sheets of the big banana leafs
Ready the stalk-a that kills like a stock on a Nigga I'm full o ' the dark green
Smokin' got me coughin', smokin' the (?) often
Staggerin' like a real drunk motherfucker
I think I'm too high for this walkin'
My head started spinnin'
I'm feelin' real crazy, can't keep the world still
Indo smoke - that shit's no joke
My niggas know thats on the real
Homies know just where it's at
Niggas keepin' fat contacts
Stout sacks pounds of that, motherfuckin' chicken black
Pour me a glass of the Hennessy yeah
Inhale 'til I shed a tear, get a chair
Then I begin to soar deep in the atmosphere
Passin' and rollin' grunges like a mad Jamaican
Damn DJ Paul my nig', I'm smoked out
Here you take it, cause I'm full o' that weed
Man let the track thump
Still I end up yellin' to my nigga "Smoke a junt!"

[Hook]
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt

Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
We smoke off the ink

We get fucked up
We takin' them hard pulls, hard pulls
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
You’ll get a wiff when you sniff up in the air

Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Pass that junt, pass that junt nigga!

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Gotta keep plenty bud crackin', let the shit drought
Scarecrow and Killa Man rollin' wit' da best out
Must lick this shit player why you wanna save it player?
My nigga you stop-a the chiefin' that buddy for keepin'
Put that shit in the air
Ev'rybody breakin' sacks empty out the whole bag
Roll the shit up and then we passin' round the weed
Nasty bunch of niggas standin' 'round gettin' hell polluted
You wanna get fucked up the reefers undisputed
Strangers wallkin' up and
Smell the pure and wanna get a hit
You wanna get-a dose-a of-a mingy?
Best pay tribute trick!
Scarecrow don't give a fuck, gotta let the nature blaze
Triple 6 Mafia fire the bud up while we on the stage
Loungin' in the back gettin' fucked up right before a show
Ridin' outta town smoke a ounce in back o' the limo
Thought this shit is over mayne
I think I smoked a thousand blunts
Still I end up yellin' to my nigga Black:
"Smoke a junt, smoke a junt!"

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
You’ll get a wiff when you sniff up in the air
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
Smoking on the sack in the lac with the vogues
Smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt, smoke a junt
