[Hook] 2x
Death to those who crossing, who ever come across me
Hydra-Shoks hot in your body make you change the topic
Got some shit like cyclops, I don't need a scope for optic
So much lead that Superman couldn't see trough your body

[Verse 1]
I'm the bloody bloody Scarecrow, Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
The AK with silencer will knock out the intestines out of your stomach
Don't try when I'm gun high, .50 clickin' like a llama
Sucker suffer from results of my destruction make you vomit
Blazin' like a comet and I got the Tommy
... body tissue make you scream for mommy
Mossberg pumpin', blow you out the galaxy
Standin' by the police sayin': "damn what a tragedy"
Dead is my mentality, it will come unhappily
Take out everybody, I don't worry 'bout retaliating
Murder got me salivating, Lord is my annihilating
Bitch you wanna violate me? Eyes no longer dilating!

[Verse 2]
BLAY!
First I cut your tongue out, then I pull your teeth out
With some pliers
Fuckin' with the (?) will get you tied and set on fire
Bite your motherfuckin' face off like a damn papaya
Put your motherfuckin' kids up in that goddamn dryer
... I don't think that you can get much higher
Man I saw that trick reach for his head when it flied off
I will put your punkass to sleep faster than some nytol
Think I'm lyin' when I said I spare yo life? You're right dawg!
Infrared pierce through the fog, beat your face in with a log
Throw your body in the pit, watch you devoured by the hogs
Here your lungs fill up with blood and kill all your oxygen
Hit your life before I fire the Shok thats quickly droppin' him
