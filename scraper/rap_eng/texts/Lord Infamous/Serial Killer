[Verse 1]
It's Keyser, sniff some coke, drink some Budweiser
Spin your intestines when this pin slice guts
Tighten up a red fire glowin' Uzi firearm
Knock ya fruit out cha pie crust, battle lighten up
Like helium, I'm a medium - I can tell you're fucked
Now metaphoric gut' em, very morbid, crush nuts
Guts, no glory welcome to your horror story
Once again it's on, forty stories, body in the quarry
Just look slim jim and get outta this grim
Peel, kill the pilgrims, burn the damn cornfield (ill)
Sometimes ya have to make a real sacrifice
He was crucified for ya life, you gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Vicodin, nitrous, righteous Infamous Titus
Check for his vitals, heroin, ice in my sinus
You want 'em dead, don't make the devil (?) us
The honorable execution, the crucial hiatus
You want it over, gimme the yoda
Venomous cobra on bolivian coca
Soldiers like Soza, Mind of Minolta
Take me a toke-ah, spit his flesh on his poster
Step in the whirlwind, this where the world is
Kissin' his girlfriend (?) shot in the turban
Haulin' his corpses in the back of suburban
Scavengers, roaches pick his flesh off his bones then
