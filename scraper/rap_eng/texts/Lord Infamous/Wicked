[Hook] 2x
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Do some wicked shit, with a torch 'n pliers

[Verse 1]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Turmoil, chaos, mayhem and havoc
Crows wrath is very tragic
Dark age executioner, medieval savage
Bloody bounty hunter
Through the ages slaughtered many torments
Thought to be vampiric
No proof of my death has been recorded
But the path is a sadistic mutilation trademark
Right by the cadavers with sixes in blood write on the wall
Theres a whole new generation of the Three 6 Mafia clan
Pino, Thero, BJ (?), Loco, many more gone mad
Channel 3, Channel 5, 13, 24 and thirty
Can't find your body floatin' in the fuckin' dirty-dirty
Chain what's left of your bitch to some fuckin' cinder block
You be decapitated by some freshwater bull sharks

Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Do some wicked shit, with a torch 'n pliers

[Verse 2]
BLAY!
Hard to swallow when the blood is gurglin' up
From your esophagus
Niggas are like bitches to me, all you just androgynous
Cannon dismantle yo anatomy, can't handle me
Right in the Saint funeral procession with your family
You may come not cheaper they spreadin' his fuckin' ashes
Missiles from these pistols disintegrated the bastard
Master of combatible tactics, measures are drastic
Automatic package, you splattered all in the attic
Choose your favorite way to play
Guns or blades are either way
I'm a samurai banzai ninja, green beret
Soze a cold day in hades, you take me
I'mma blast your ass back to eighties with faded jeans

Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
