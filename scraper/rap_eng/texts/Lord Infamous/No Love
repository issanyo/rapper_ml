[Skit from the movie "Unusual Suspects"]

[Hook] 2x
Bitch you want a piece of this?
Might as well take the heart
There was no love from the start
Sprinkled body parts
Woe onto you my foe
Cause you just don't know
Woe onto you my foe
Cause you just don't know

[Verse]
My business wicked, gangsta, bloody
Twisted, mystic, mafia sick
Drop you and your bitch one night with sixty razor rick
Suckin' plasma like a tick
And yes the fork shaped like pitch
Snatch you out the mist
And throw whats left into the murky Miss'
Come and dance into this devil tune
And it's a slow groove
And I'm efficient with this weapon I use
Not just on Pro Tools
Get yo body blown in two separated, mutilated
Soze do bloody pools
Vibrate brains and take 'em to
Asiatic golden triangle Vietnam don
Saigon, magic wand, Voltron, Capcom
Snap 'em, pap 'em, nap 'em
Silence when I tap 'em
I smell they blood
Pussy nigga that's when I trap 'em

[Talking]
Yea I'm the rapper known as Lord Infamous
I first encountered Keyser man
Actually I was looking for a hitman man
And I heard about this guy man
Known as the perfect killer man
But I never seen his face
He never been caught man
We can't have a face to face
Cause uh he dont wanna be seen
So we ... did it by uhm connections
But man, when I saw his work man
Had to get him
But when I saw what he did in his work man
There was alotta overkill
Man I got to thinkin' ...
This motherfucker is a psychopath man
...
