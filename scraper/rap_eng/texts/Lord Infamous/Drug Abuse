[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Drugs I abuse 'em, I cannot refuse 'em
Stopping is futile so I keep on using

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous, wicked, sniffin' brasilian
Tryin' two cups that keeps the pacific
Puffin' on this monkey piss is delicious
Vicious, mystic, maniac, twisted
Snortin' a wiff of the cocaine blizzard
Chemical wizard, sensors lizard
Evil enigma when I unleash the ziplock zipper
Jack the ripper, cranium crippler
Evil dictator Adolf Hitler
Swallow prescriptions with malicious
Thoughts of victims crucifixions
Keyser Soze the technician
Very efficient and relentless
Amphetamines heighten my senses
And I (?) with barbiturates
Took a (?) with a naughty mixture
Lovely fictions paint a picture
Ice and microdot a trip-ah
Hypodermic needles, liquor
16 oz of drain zippo
Roll a swisher with my niggas
Got that bud, a girl I flip her
Let me get another wiffer

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Drugs I abuse 'em, I cannot refuse 'em
Stopping is futile so I keep on using

[Verse 2: Crucified]

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Got something for you and you and you
And that motherfucker over there too
Drugs I abuse 'em, I cannot refuse 'em
Stopping is futile so I keep on using
