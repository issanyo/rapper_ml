Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill with yo fuckin' brain spilled
Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill with yo fuckin' brain spilled
Automatic weaponry, I finna touch a body when I:
Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill with yo fuckin' brain spilled
Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill with yo fuckin' brain spilled

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
I got that all black stainless steel, full-time baller game is real
Fully automatic weaponry, I hit a nigga in the body so another nigga brain get peeled
He leakin' red, preggo, fluid from the gauge on sight
Pussy nigga should've never be caught in his feelings, I'm 'bout to make a killin' when I take yo life
I don't wanna murder a motherfucker but will hit 'em all with the burner if they comin' at me with the rockers
Motherfuckers they better be bulletproof or duck shots from the artillery I'm sendin' at you and yo brothers
Hollow point bullets blow when they contact
A nigga flesh in the middle of the combat
Niggas ain't ready for killers when they come back
With the agenda of vengeance, heart beyond black
We get so many victims off in this land fill
Will I shoot first to live another day? You damn will
I roll with mobsters who pull them yappas up out they closet
Rock Solid Mafia, 6th Enterprise in this bitch with a new innovation for dollars

Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill with yo fuckin' brain spilled
Hit 'em with the stained steel, bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in the land fill

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Post up in the cut with monkey nuts
Servin' them junkies, stackin' my bucks
Them narcs they out, I don't give a fuck
I'm servin' who I know, fuck all new customers
Sittin' on the porch with my dope in my hand
Hide behind a tree everytime I see a van
I need me some money so I gotta take a chance
Gun on me too cause a nigga ain't playin'
Plan so careful every move I make
Crumbs in the bag so I re-rock the shake
Chevy break down so I ain't never too late
Icy white flakes, snow or base
I'm tryin' to get straight, I ain't tryin' to be the mane
Try to rob me - I'ma shoot you in the brain
Back against da wall, witness the flame from a stang
You broke niggas jankin'
Crackin' yo head, that's some I enjoy
I have yo ass filin' a police report
Just front me a busta, I'm laughin' in court
Pay a good lawyer and hit a resort
While havin' yo fake ass shot off the porch
You scared of the reaper, you so paranoid
I'm poltergeist dressed in black with an umbrella
You cannot avoid me you shaky lil nigga

[Verse 3: T-Rock]
Cowards be tryin' to be feelin' (?) Son of Sam
Serial killers and child molesters, I murk 'em man
With that .44, I'm clownin' like I'm in a circus band
My hollow point thunder shower on rivals, it's curtains fam
Montana when blastin' the K, that's how they act in the A
Don't be heroic, we go four hoursemen (?)
Me and yo hoe have a threeway to throw extra salt in yo face
Hand me the key to yo treasures straight from yo vault to my safe
No love for my rivals, fuck the 5-0, make 'em die slow
They eyes roll as they lie cold like a tide hoe
Survival, what I ride for
I give a fuck if you scared of me
Niggas peep to be aware of the pedigree
Stainless steel is always my choice of weaponry
