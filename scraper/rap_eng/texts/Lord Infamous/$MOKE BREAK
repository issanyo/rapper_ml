[Verse 1: Black Smurf]
(HU$TLE!)
Dry in the street on the creep
Smoked my last blunt, made a nigga start to tweak (damn)
$crim hit to Chetta, tell ‘em pull up
But I ain’t got woods for the roll-up
$moke 'dat 'till we pass out
You ain’t put in no funds get your ass out (pussy)
Babysit, I'ma lash out
Taking blunts to the head 'til I cash out (work)
I’m a fiend for the weed like a stoner
Keep your lines, I just need marijuana
Backwoods till I’m in a kush-coma
Hotbox car feel like a sauna
I love this money, this money
But Mary she do something to me
I need it, I fiend it, I want it
Feel sober, I gut it and roll it (smoke)

[Verse 2: YUNG CHRIST]
Hunnid thou how I'm living
Break 'em off with that llama
Codeine up in my kidneys
Got that smoke like a sauna
You can't play with my money
Twenty-ounce and some mud
Bad temper like Sonny, and I'm full of them drugs
Up in East Memphis with Hu$tle
Bitch, I'm outta them slums
All them convicts my muscle
Eat them pills like they Tums
I got that work if you need it
I might just rob you and keep it
It ain't no secret I'm the one they call Jesus

[Verse 3: YUNG MUTT]
Smoking and driving
Smoking and driving got me into trouble a couple of times
I remember when I had to piss in a cup for a couple of summers in 2009
Hotboxing feeling like a tropic hot-spot
Until the fucking Five-O call the K9 snotting for that fucking pot
Though I told the cop we didn't smoke weed with fucking seeds
So what he mean explain this, please?
I should have grabbed the fucking weed and peaced
Asking me to rat
Bitch, I'll take my chances in court
Do my time and pay the fees
