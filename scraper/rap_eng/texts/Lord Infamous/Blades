Scarecrow with dope in my veins, you can tell I'm deranged with the Tussionex rushin' my brain
With the tolerance reachin' the sky on the atmosphere high, you can tell 'cause I'm actin' so strange
Nigga don't try it at home, you won't make it that long, I be doin' it twenty years strong
And yes the Lord Infamous prone to take multiple combinations of the dope to the dome
Read in my mind, you can look in my eyes, it's the Infamous solar system kinda high
Twenties and forties and eighties, 120 OZ. Promethazine, C-O-K-E

Some niggas screw it, I'm stayin true to it
I must be the best at whatever I'm doin'
