[Dialogue: Lord Infamous and (Juicy J)]
Yo G, what would you do
If all of the sudden you woke up one morning
And the world was ending, man?
(ha, I'm checkin' in man, haha)
It's like just...
The world was...
It was just crumblin'
(ha, that's messed up dog, haha)
What if God came down and reached for everybody
(Is he here, is he here)
There's nothing you could do
Ay, but hey check it out, what would you do?

[Hook]
What you gonna do when God calls time out?
Are you gonna run, try to hide, scream, and shout?
Are you gonna drop to your knees, cry and pout?
What you gonna do when God calls time out?
What you gonna do when God calls time out?
Deep in your mind, will you have any doubts?
Cause all your time on this Earth has ran out
On that mighty mighty day, when God calls time out

[Verse: Lord Infamous]
To all you murderers, maniacs, fornicators, rapists, thieves
All you drug dealers, gang bangers, smokers, indeed
All you sinners; sinners, you best take heed
As I tell of the day we will beg and plead
King of Kings, Lord of Lords, see us coming
Too late for forgiveness, not too late for a promise
Did you know every time you were un-married and screwed
Each one of those counted as a sin, damn fool
You said it's alright, cause God grows the weed
He also grew the fruit in the Garden of Eden
Don't abuse every season, it's getting a step closer
The Mark of the Beast is around if you focus
You said you found God, but you still hesitatin'
You best beware, Mr. Satan is waitin'
To come let you bake in the flames he has tamed
And make you a slave throughout infinite days

[Hook]
