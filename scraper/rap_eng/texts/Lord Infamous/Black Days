[Intro]
BLAY!
Lord Infamous, Scarecrow
I practiced the black arts bitch
I'm a black belt of this shit nigga
I started this Devil Shyt!
Horrorcore nigga!

[Hook] 2x
This is a black heart, this is a black god
This is a black mob, this is a black rock
This is a black haze, this is a black grave
This is a black maze, these are black days

[Verse 1]
Step in my territory you will feel all my inventory
When I'm giving you all of this brutal destruction
Your blood starts to rushing from Lord Voorhes
Get down on your knees (trick), put a slug behind your ear
And watch it pop out through your teeth, good grief
Niggas don't like me I must say the feelin's mutual
Look at me all tough and I will shoot you in your pupils
Get stabbed, stomped, punched, burned, double barrel gauge
Nigga Lord's a cannibal and I'll chew off your fucking face
I'm very fucked up in the head I will empty the lead
Call his punk ass mammy tell her he in critical med
(won't make it)
Then I will send you a beautiful bouquet of Infamous with the black flowers
Better hurry the fuck up he won't make it another hour

[Hook] 2x
This is a black heart, this is a black god
This is a black mob, this is a black rock
This is a black haze, this is a black grave
This is a black maze, these are black days

[Verse 2]
And I decorate every room in the house with your skin
(period bitch)
It's the one-eighty-seven specialist
Criminal mind, black Soviet Kremlin
They better bring the Tac Squad, SWAT and the Special Op's
Cause I got the .50 rifle with a scope like Cyclops
Bodies are lying everywhere
They bleeding all over the pavement brah
Blow your fuckin' fro off for you nigga, like you Quest Love
Step up to me bitch you wanna start a fucking altercation
I'ma hammer your fucking neck and give it an alteration
I don't think I ever wanna see you 'round here
Bitch be careful you might end up underground here
The rules of me aren't very difficult, it's very simple
Don't fuck up or you will surely get 2 to the temple

[Hook] 2x
This is a black heart, this is a black god
This is a black mob, this is a black rock
This is a black haze, this is a black grave
This is a black maze, these are black days
