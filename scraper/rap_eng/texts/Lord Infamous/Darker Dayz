[Intro: Lord Infamous]
Soze, Lord Infamous the Scarecrow
Rowdy Bounty Hunter, blay!
Motherfucker

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
It's the Rowdy Bounty Hunter, futuristic homo sapien
I can drop 'em dead and use my demons to awake in 'em
Terrorist from Tennessee, I practice voodoo culture
Leave yo carcass in the backyard ate by the vultures
Art of War by Sun Tzu, mixed with deadly voodoo
.50 Caliber, nobody matter when it enters you
Torture techniques I use have been practiced over centuries
I get high and think of different ways to cause you misery
Step into my domicile, soon you will be smellin' foul
Killer from the nile, body pile, they been here a while
(Step into my domicile, soon you will be smellin' foul
Killer from the nile, body pile, they been here a while)
Do-do-don't be horrified, nigga death is just the other side
Don't be terrified when these triple six killers ride, ride
(Don't be horrified, do-do-don't be horrified
Do-do-don't be terrified when these triple six killers ride, ride)
