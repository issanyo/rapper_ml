[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
12 years old, 1994 bumpin' "Come with me to hell"
Smokin on a J for the first time
Lord Infamous was one of the few that got into my mind
When I was high and told me to rhyme
Now here we are, 17 years later
Been with Hypnotize for a motherfuckin' decade
Runnin' my own shit, CEO Wyte Music Records
Everybody in the crew shoppin' chef blades
We up in the bread room, we creatin' magic
That most of you motherfuckers never heard in yo life
I was raised on the shit where they kidnap ya
Throw you in the back of a Chevy with yo kid and yo wife
I know that sounds fucked up and all
But messin' with the Mafia that's as light as it gets
And the Wyte Music crew got some dudes in it
That'll do it and more crazy, gruesome shit
I'm the young on the (?) happen to be with
It was all part of DJ Paul's master plan
The perfect time for me to shine
Everything's in line, it couldn't happen any faster man
I run this shit and I'm the most supportin' piece of cargo when the money-train passin' by
I get a little older, I'mma cocky motherfucker
And I still tote the .40 cal bitch and I:

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
One of a kind, it's the venomous Lord Infamous
You can get it if you in perimeter
Come on and enter da satanic minister
Penetrate, disintegrate and duh pendulum
Lord the barbaric, you get in my medic
I take out my beef before they start on the credits
Tartar konfetti, make you beheaded
Make all your bodyparts look like spaghetti
Picture your head blast around on my floor
Like that Budd on TV and you lookin' patethic
... for a second
So you can hear every word and you know that I said it
Flow kinda vicious, the very malicious
I know when I promise I will not regret it
Come in the gunnin' so keep the car runnin'
It's gonna get bloody so niggas be ready
I am Lord Infamous and yes I'm very naughty
Every strain in my DNA is made from a narcotic
'Crow and Lil Wyte rode the magic dragon to the party
Fuck with us and aggrevated murders are the charge man
