[Hook: Geto Boys sample]
Fuck that, say goodbye to the bad guy
Left for dead, I pumped those bitches full of lead

[Verse 1]
Massacre, massacre, 5-0 getting massacred
I'm so sick of fuckin' blue lights
Scarecrow lust to blast on da cop for
When I cock up the gat and stopper
Infamous, I'm Infamous, the cops are miggedy-mopa
Scarecrow, Scarecrow, cops you best beware hoe
When I see a cop I'm gonna shoot him in his fuckin' throat
It's so simple - shoot him in his temple
Beat a fuckin' cops ass till he layin' crippled
Hell yeah, cops scared, what a fuckin' relief
When I kill the officers I'm gonna kill the fuckin' chief
A thousand cop assassins lurkin' in the fuckin' dark
Get all the motherfuckers (?) goddamn (?) cars
Cops are one timers yo like they gotta hang
Every nigga get ya strap, kill some fucking pigs mane!
When I click up on da .50's yo they ass is through
Hell yeah, son of a bitch, murder on the menu

[Hook: Geto Boys sample]
Fuck that, say goodbye to the bad guy
Left for dead, I pumped those bitches full of lead

[Verse 2]
Fellas who think they can fuck with the killas
They foolish, I'm blowin' 'em outta sight
Infamous the Scarecrow is what they call me, dodge that red light
Butcher, bitch I cut legs off with the hacksaw
Grand slam swing, watch the sledge hammer crack jaw
Black Glock, schizophrenic Scarecrow, bloody battle axe
Bash him in his cataracts, feed him to my alley rats
Yeah hoe it's like that, fuck you, you don't like it
Shoot that trick, I need a cigarette, give me a light bitch
Cause when I blast the gat close yo motherfuckin' curtains
If yo ass don't die oh you will be hurt for certain
So make way for the motherfuckin' punisher
House full of dead motherfuckers on the furniture
Lyrical life threats Scarecrow shall continue
Blow 'em up, cooking guts, drag em through the venue
Call the bomb squad on yo ass will turn to soup
Damn fool, Scarecrow got murder on the menu
