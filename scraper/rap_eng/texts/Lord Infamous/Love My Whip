[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
I am Lord Infamous, call me ... all down
... four times ... town
If it's ........... induce
... we hop in the Chevy ... loose
Uh smoke in the ride, smoke in my eyes, smoke from the tires
Mane I despise these butterflies ...
My ride is so mysterious, yo gal is lookin' curious
Her man is gettin' furious, he 'bout to go delirious
I'm ..., he 'bout to catch his period
Cause never could he deal with us, mane it's so ridiculous
The Escalade sleigh on the blade, choppin' on a blade
Got the razor blade on the plate, heat up all the day
... damn (?) like a fag
(?) wiff dawg, the whole galaxy 'bout to catch a contact
It's the mack attack, got the (?)
Swangin' (?) on the chrome lips
Watch the paint drip, flop and flip, love my whip
