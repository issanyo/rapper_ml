[Talking]

[Hook] 2x
I'm married to this game, till death do us part
For richer or for poor, Imma give it all my heart
And I take this fucking mic as my lawful wedded wife
And Imma rock it every night just to keep my game tight

[Verse 1]
Wildest barbarians, lots of hysteria
Black pitbull terriers, venomous area
Sniper is strikin' with Infamous wrath
Cracking yo fuckin' head in half
Let's take a bloody bath in my Michael Myers mask
Dump them like some gladiators or thee annihilators
Also thee eradicators, the Loony Bin escaped
I'm hittin' 'em with the clothes lines
Smashin' the fucking vertabrae
Wolfpack predator, don't discrimanate on prey
Every sunday Infamous transform to Ted Bundy
.44 hollow in yo tummy, ain't working on Monday
Whats up with the Scarecrow? You know till the world blow
But no disrespect but I'll swear you like you build it hoe
Ain't hatin' on you bro cause you wear a lot of jewelry
But my only bling is that fuckin' chrome artillery
Nigga are you feeling me? Need to take this serious
Infamous fucking you punkass-niggas up like I'm furious

[Hook] 2x
I'm married to this game, till death do us part
For richer or for poor, Imma give it all my heart
And I take this fucking mic as my lawful wedded wife
And Imma rock it every night just to keep my game tight

[Verse 2]
Trick you know that I know you ain't got no fuckin' nuts
Bitch I know that you know I'll fill you fuckin' full of slugs
Pistol pop, body flop, then you drop in the mud
Knock off ya block from the hot shots from this thug
Revolver silver, make you shiver with this pain I deliver
Niggas injured from revenger bullets, enter every center
Mentally scarred, very hard, bitch I will pull your card
Melt you slobs like some lard when this Glock boils your heart
Slop chop, blown apart, mafia G, vice squad
Ram rod pimp stick, red hot cum shot
Slap hard, smack, whack, rock apart
Hungry moany stomach growling cuz I ain't had shit but slop
Want yo fuckin pieces hoe, want my money right here hoe
You'll never be Scarecrow, slap some sense in ya hoe

[Hook] 2x
I'm married to this game, till death do us part
For richer or for poor, Imma give it all my heart
And I take this fucking mic as my lawful wedded wife
And Imma rock it every night just to keep my game tight
