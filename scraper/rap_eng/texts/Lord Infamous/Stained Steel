(It's Keyser, Keyser...)

[Verse]
BLAY!
Blastin' the round, desirin' destruction
The Infamous massacre master enforcer
Get struck with a dose of: I tear up yo torso
The nigga is tastin' the water - abort the mission
We get no competition
Pictures of these niggas missin'
Rabid, vicious - Doberman, Pinscher
Pop you with the clip and stitch 'em
With precision, bloody children
Brain cells drippin' off the ceilin'
Millimeter millin' the chitlins
Brains right next to the chitlins
Slugs prepared for the shells
Nigga come with me to hell
Lime on the corpse it will knock off dead smell
Leavin' chunks of your body all over the trail
Sniffin' a line of the alpo
Then I cut off your nuts with the blade of the scalpel
Razor blades and nuts into the bone
Really lethal shrapnel (boom)
Down in basement paralyzed
Cut your spine across, I'm scared
Better keeping you alive
You pray for death but IT'S NOT HERE

[Outro] 4x
Hit 'em with da stained steel
Bitch ass niggas stand still
End up in a landfill
With yo fuckin' brain spilled

(Soze, Soze ... BLAY!)
