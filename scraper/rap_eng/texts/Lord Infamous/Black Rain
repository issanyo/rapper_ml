[Hook: Lord Infamous sample]
I'm gonna run outside mane, and pop these thangs
Wanna-wanna come play in the Black Rain?

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Nigga if I said it best believe I don't regret it
I'mma end it quick, start off that bitch role in the credits
I know you want that old Scarecrow machine gun-flow
On this one, no
I'mma take it slow and put a hatched blade across yo throat
When a high caliber smack ya, knock you off yo feet and (?)
Flip you like a spatula and watch yo whole head crack up
Have yo bitch ass stangin' like a swarm of damn bees
Make you hit yo knees when you hit the six degrees
Be on yo neck nigga, like I have seven clones
.50 cal will have the meat fallin' off yo bones
So don't be scared nigga, don't you get fucking nervous
... watch the world perverse

I'm gonna run outside mane, and pop these thangs
Wanna-wanna come play in the Black Rain?

[Verse 2: II Tone]
Horrifying tales of murder, witness to the mayhem
Pull the pitchfork out the fire, let the world know who I am
II Tone bitch, what the fuck you haters mean?
Been doin' this shit since '94 and with the same team
On the robbing spree bitch, with "A million wayz to murda"
Heaven sent, hell bound, face down in the dirt-ah
Memphis Tn is where I'm from, they can find you on the noose
Close casket on you bitches, everyday I'm packin' tools
Crucifyin' sissy niggas; you a victim of my shit
You can pray to god about the odds but it ain't changin' shit
I can't tell you what I feel cause my thoughts are kinda strange
See it's cursed for you niggas when you fuck with Black Rain
