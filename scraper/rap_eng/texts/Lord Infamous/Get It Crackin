[Hook: T-Rock] 2x
None of you niggas want beef
Let's get it crackin'
We ain't gon' rest till you sleep
So let's get it crackin'
We will show up on your street
Like let's get it crackin'
It's all like war, ain't no peace
When we get the clappin'

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous, trick, I'm the deadliest rapper
To ever spit this rapid-fire-ass flow
You really don't want to be pissing me off
I will wait till you sleep and cut your fuckin' throat
Look up the Scarecrow in your dictionary
And you will see I'm defined of the pain
I'm taking a needle and fill it with acid
And stick it into your damn jugular vein
I promise you bitch, you don't want to get wrong
Cause matter of fact trick I am calling you blob
Fuck what you think, I will blast out your thoughts
I will grind up your bones and I snort 'em like dust
I sit back and observe you slimy sissy ass niggas
With Slytherin gangs
I can't figure out for the life of me
Google say you whack ass niggas on contract mane
I'm back in the day when life was a hell
And I'm here to say "all of you pussies damn straight"
When Lucifer let me up out the hell gates
He told me "bring me back up the MC slay"
I'm cookin' up fresh fuckin' wussies
[?] on my fuckin' foreman grill
You talk some shit
I wash your fuckin' mouth out with some massengill
I ram this long barrel .44 mag up yo ass
But I'll just put it to yo dome
But you will probably like that fag
Infamous cocaine assassin, weak niggas
I blast 'em up outta the universe
Bitch you better disperse
'fore I spill your brains in your purse

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
You won't see tomorrow
My killers too crunk and hostile
Don't need the hollow
Smack a bottle 'cross his avocado
Follow the (?) swallow
Yo grindin' die like Pablo
Game is the boss , you just a (?)
For real a bitch I know
Hey pic this like Picasso
Knock niggas out like Drago
Business is business, it's the model
This life is a lotto
You doin' me like Rocko
Bitin' a G, you borrow
The style from me so we burnin' up yo (?) logo
Panic caught off in morrow
The family heart full of sorrow
Empty the cartridge in yo (?)
I'm heartless (?)
Shit from hater's informal
Smarter than you retardos
Lyrical Leonardo
Dressed in all-black like I'm Zorro
I'mma spark up a (?)
(?) live in sorrow
Keep goin' hard
And fuckin' more hoes than Ricky Ricardo
Five-six with a Mac-11
Detention my presence
Blacken yo section within seconds
No matter the preference

[Verse 3: II Tone]
(?) for you niggas who like to talk but never move
See his (?) upon my chest, don't try me like a fool
Meanin' (?) on sight, my mind ain't right
Sippin' syrup and kryptonite
Gun cockin', suckers droppin' in the M like every night
I'm on a mission, got 'em wishin' that you make it back
Choppers poppin', shells droppin' then the line goes flat
I'm a Magnolia nigga, it's been in me since my birth
Others talk that shit and swallow spit
My Crime Click run this turf
Niggas havin' half, they flippin', floppin'
I'm a G, I'm never stoppin'
In too deep, I'm hellbound
Y'all wanna see my casket droppin'
Thuggin', pimpin', gangsta walkin'
Swag so fly, yo bitch-ass stalkin'
Nina is my passenger
So what's up with that shit you talkin'?
Forty reasons, ain't no question
My best friends are Smith & Wesson
Satan's soldier, flip the folder
So ya better count yo blessings
Sick of you niggas that talkin' that shit
And lyin' about the pistol packin'
I'm so, so hood, (?) something (?) good
I'm wishing you would
Let's get it crackin'
