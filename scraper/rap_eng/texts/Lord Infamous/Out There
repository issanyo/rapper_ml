[Part 2: Lord Infamous]
And the maintenance man was lying next to me dead
As the ... I was on my damn bed
... Tuesday ...
And I heard some commotion, loud bang overhead
Somebody on the ground and diggin' me out
(?) everybody ... figure it out
When the casket popped
He told me what the shit was about
The maintenance man had a nephew that was underground
As a goon that I knew way back in the south
Foothome projects nigga, puttin' it down
C-Rock it's time to murder everybody around
Crack crowns, grab the axe (?) got some thrax
Hit a couple lines and made it out to get to the Lac
... four time's on (?)
Smoked just a sack (?) nigga hopped in the back
On the way to the guttural killers to get the gats
