I got them smoking papers

Never leavin' home without it

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow, tha calico give ya some inlet
Here comes the Infamous bloody vampire
When I suck out your oxygen, take out your wind
And connect the dots on your dead skin
Get me a hit of adrenalin catch this Filament  brains on the ceiling'
I don't know why do you wanna play killa
Catch you a injury fill you with pure lead
Puttin' the .50 cal up to yo neck
When I'm snatchin' the tongue right up outta yo head
I am the (?) sparin' a hoe ... end up in the med
Choppin' off the razors edges, slice 'em like some light bread
Love to see the spread turn bright blood-red
Mane you don't want this predicament
I will get ignorant, smoke me a cigarette
This heinous pistol, I need to get rid of it
Make your bitch ass like you on your period
Seriously make me not fuck around
Especially when I'm on Funky Town
Load this .500 round and knock the noodles out your crown
Passionate bounty hunter full of coke and the marijuana
That is green as Iguana's
Cap with the thunder and took a bitch hop
You don't wanna get popped by the Infamous punisher
You hear the "BOOM" of the shotgun bass
Double aught bucks takin' off your throat and your face

[Verse 2: Lil Jack]
My nigga just jumped in the chevy
He told me these suckers was heavy
We ready I kill anything that I scary
They scatterin', windows was shatterin'
Bullets was rattlin' or should I say ratta-tat-tattin' man
Had to been about a hundred of 'em
But I'm constantly dumpin' on (?) for nothin'
Sip purple drank and my gold chain
Poured with ice, snort a whole thang
Guillotine loaded above of his head
Fuck the police we say officer dick
................off with your kids
Screamin' as you see 'em  flee
Weed nigga fuck your beats nigga
Fuck these hoes I don't trust these streets
I don't ball with brand new one
Plus this weed nigga plus this heat

[Verse 3: II Tone]
(II Tone)
I'm gon slow it down I'm high as fuck
Don't need nobody I don't love
I'm paper stickin', fuck the blunt
That's my style no need to stunt
I twist it, hit it, light it, you can't fight it cause it's super loud
Give a fuck what you think cause I make my momma proud
Money ... ain't no reggae, it be loud pack
And my whole crew smokin' good, best believe they comin' back
Doctor treat it, said I need this, so we rolled the strip
I been smokin' since the age of twelve (?) be a trip
Niggas say they smokin' good but I swear they smokin' dirt
If you come 'round while I'm chiefin' you gon' get yo feelings hurt
So high as I'm smokin', I'm keepin' my focus
From blunts to junts, no need to front
(?) on my bag
Leave it my nigga, that's why we mad
