Where you from nigga?
My city is a motherfucker
Nigga, nigga you know how we get down

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
When I'm posted up, scrapped in the chair
All through my city keep one in the chamber
Everywhere dangerous, don't trust a soul
Don't fuck with strangers, you might get kidnapped
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Hurst Village, Smokey City, cap peeler smokin' on killa
Dope flipper, foam whipper, bands getter, don't fuck with fake niggas
North Memphis, South Memphis, Westwood, Orange Mound, Black Haven niggas makin' stangs
Everybody move to the Eastwood gangs and bang solo
Hundred pounds in my Rover in the garage in the cold slangin' dope
Dodgin' the popo and them robbers, scrapped with the M4 on you hoes
So with the shit, creepin' (?) every motherfucker know each other
So many rollin' with the devil (they rollin') God please forgive 'em
Watch over me, keepin' these suckers freeze
I'm in positions I'm posed to be when I'm satisfied just being me
Skinny Pimp respect the industry
And alotta these tricks be some real haters
Fake hood snakes and smiley faces
Better know who you with when you in my city
Cause First 48 got plenty cases

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
When I'm posted up, scrapped in the chair
All through my city keep one in the chamber
Everywhere dangerous, don't trust a soul
Don't fuck with strangers, you might get kidnapped
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
We are livin' in the final days and all we got is us
CNN is real (?) Fox is only (?) us
Racial tension at an all-time high, look what the law give us
Got us blinded by a color yet and still we all niggas
Ain't no perfect place I'm at alive, I see the flaws in us
Better repent or die, to fill the parlor we must all enter
Donald Trump ain't gon' save you from Vegas, he's a man himself
Plus he don't give a damn 'bout my race, his only plan is death
(?) Hillary will forgive a G, artillery on me
Holy war is inevitable, my people won't see no peace
That's why it's M.O.E over everything but G-O-D
We want that life and the promised land before we D-I-E
Ya heard me?

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings

All through my city keep one in the chamber
Everywhere dangerous, don't trust a soul
Don't fuck with strangers, you might get kidnapped
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Increasin' my energy Scarecrow, these sissy ass wussies, I make em' my petrol
The Infamous juggernaut give 'em more slugs from the Glock and they rot in the ghetto
I'm blastin' heavy metal but this here ain't no Metallica
I buck' em then embellish ya, that burner in da Challenger
Illuminati in Bugatti, do karate with the shotty
Bloody party, very naughty, infrared dot his nogging
Mysterious disappearances we're experiencin'
When killers start appearin' then these niggas just dismember men
Bounce up on the curb in the Suburban, bullet in yo turban
Trigger finger twitchin', almost hit yo fuckin' kissin' girlfriend
It's kinda chilly in this bitch, turn the temp to Kelvin
Lord is above the law, cold blooded one-eight-seven
Yo, you don't want that hoe, fuck up yo whole physical
You bitches tremblin' like a leaf in a sadistic tornado (yeah)
Damn I need another slice of some nigga-pie
Keyser Soze came to play and yes I'm turned up til I die

[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
In my hood I got much respect, cause I grew up reppin' Memphis
Nothing but teddy bears on the poles from the killings and the dealings
