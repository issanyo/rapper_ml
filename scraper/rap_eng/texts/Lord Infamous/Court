[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Infamous ... my (?) madness (?) on these wussies
Shoot you in the back of the head
While you eatin' her out and (?) her fuckin' pussy
Bitch I'm a killa that don't take all that much for you to fuckin' push me
Camouflage, .50 caliber rifle lyin' in the fuckin' bushes
Can you smell what I'm cooking? Cannibal call it "rapper-stew"
Lyrical Bruce Lee bitch, a black belt with these martial art dummies
Pervert a nigga ... in that 24 inch (?)
Serial killer, the Infamous villain, they find yo head up on the block
I'm comin' to court and I'm fuckin' ready bitch you just have my cheddy
But if you lose my cash yo family, kids will all get beheaded
Now I'm sittin' in the court room ... all our money
But if you got the money you can buy freedom from anybody
