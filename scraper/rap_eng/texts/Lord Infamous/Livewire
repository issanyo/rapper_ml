[Intro]
BLAY!
Yeah you know who it is motherfucker
Lord Infamous, Scarecrow, Keyser Soze
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
Man I can't believe some of these motherfuckin' niggas
They claim they bang, they claim a organization
But these pussy ass niggas try to catch you
When you lower your guard
But they don't know I'm a Livewire

[Verse]
There's no hestitation, spot a victim and elimination
This carbine mane
It's causin' masses damage with penetration
Cocksuckin' ass pussies you don't wanna test my patience
I will suffocate your ass to death with strangulation
Please don't test me mane, you do not want my aggrevation
Bury you alive and that's a fucked up situation
And I shoot yo momma in the face, no hestitation
Burn your ass alive, I call it "Triple 6 cremation"
Niggas they don't come back, give 'em permanent vacation
Cost me and you got this Sith before our other relation
Takin' lots of dope, the Scarecrow form a relaxation
I get zoned out then I go in deep meditation
You think I won't kill you, I will give you demonstration
Everything I spit man thats a fact, no perpetration
Try me and I fill you with a lava-hot sensation
I been snortin' lots of dope, my heart is really racin'
You pussies you say you killa, I think you be fakin'
Bitch call 911, hit 'em with .50, he won't make it
You can hide you nigga, but the Scarecrow very patient
Toast you on the outside but the inside you be bakin'
Some niggas they wanna do the Scarecrow worship satan
You talked all this shit and now you cryin', tremblin', shakin'
Once you marked for death you best believe we get erasin
Man I cannot count all the lives that I've taken
Yeah I never spare me a fake-ass nigga
Yeah I will leave your ass permanently injured
Yeah I can see all the bitch in your eyes
Yeah lame-ass niggas Scarecrow despise
Yeah I'm down forever with the Six
Yeah I will put your ass on a crucifix
Yeah I'm about to catch a motherfuckin' fix
Yeah thats the end I'm outta this bitch

Bitch a Livewire, Imma Livewire...
