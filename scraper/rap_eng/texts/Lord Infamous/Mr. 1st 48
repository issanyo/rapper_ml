[Intro]
The most difficult thing about beeing a homicide detective
Is when you had a case and you know who did it
But you can't prove it
It's like puttin' a puzzle together
You have to have everything kinda fall in place
It's hard, it's draining, very draining
The hope is, someday, somebody is gonna get in trouble
And they're gonna need to talk
And thats when you get the prove
Thats when you can solve the case

[Hook: Partee]
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't from Mr. 48

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
It's the silent Son of Sam, burn like the (?) slaughter from saturn
Scarecrow from the land where vicious murders are a pattern
Your fate is predetermined, quickly terminate you vermin
I hope yo mammy wise enough to take a life insurance
We don't discriminate, we just eliminate and consequate
(?) solved your case in the 1st 48, welcome to hell gates
Murder, death, kill, Memphis niggas get ill
You want yo cap peeled? Bring your punkass down here
Choose your fuckin' doom: guns, knives, blunt tools
They find your punkass leakin' in a fuckin' blood pool
No mo' (?) to swallow, sayonara from the (?) water
Lord should be your tour guide through the horror
Pop ya and pop my collar

[Bridge: Lord Infamous]
If you watch you know you never live to testify
Talk to those detectives and your whole damn family dies
Bodies rottin' all around in my part of town
Hear no evil, see no evil, never speak a sound

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Ballin' down Bellevue and then I hit a left 'lone curb
Soon as I hit Mississippi in the rearview we saw a blur
Man it look like the same niggas that was trillin' me at first
Pay no attention cause I'm high and rubbin' on this bitches skirt
Slammed down to the curb, ran in to get 'bout 8 Oz. of the purrp
Saw this bitch textin' on the phone, payed this shit no damn mind at first
Then three Chevies closed me in man, then my fucking vision blurred
Then we all begin to merge, I try to reach then heard the burst
Flashes flyin' in my face, I see AK's, can it get worse?
Then I squeeze the Mac-11, let the whole damn clip disperse
When I look down to the pavement, saw two masked niggas get wasted
Look like Lord may be the next case on the damn 1st 48 man

[Hook: Partee]
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Mr. 1st 48, 48 don't make that 48
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't escape
Bitch you can't from Mr. 48
