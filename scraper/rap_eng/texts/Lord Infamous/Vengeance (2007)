[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous, trick, it's South Memphis with me, I bet most rappers fear the inferior
I will come vaporize your punkass so quick and wipe you out like some bacteria
Boy you best take me real serious cause I will only break this shit down to yo ass once
If you want to get (?) me best bring yo boys cause yo ass cannot (?) jump
Then I come back with the double ought buck and I'm ... out a chunk
I get so crunk when I sniff this ricotta, you know that ol' South Memphis funk
Infamous one of the coldest, the strongest and when it's all over I'm lasting the longest
Niggas try to hold up with the Crow Gang but them bitches can no longer prolong this
Now that I'm all on my own ...
When I get up on this microphone niggas start shaking like it (?) the chrome
Flop 'em, (?) 'em, buck 'em, got that (?) mackin' ass hustlin'
I can make your weak ass suf-forever, body won't be discovered
Did I st-st-st-st-stutter? I don't think so motherfucker
Have you ever seen a killing spree done with wicked poetry?
Mastered the art of the multiple murdering mind mutilating monopoly
You can not run from the Keyser Soze when I'm stalking the prey called the enemy

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
You pinche maric√≥nes, you have no cojones
You motherfuckers goners fuckin' with this anaconda
You choking in a trauma, can't get out if you wanna
And now them goons they came out and trapped you in a corner
