[Hook: Evil Pimp sample]
He's now another victim of a fuckin' Deadly Stang
I watch the bubble from the blood surface from his brain

[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
The devil in my car, can't keep my seat belt fastened
The fifteen's keep on blastin', say come get crunk with me
The police creep up real slow, I turn the volume down low
Smoke up purple kush smoke and wait for the lights to say go
Let the music wang, let it rain pain, feel the bang
Drive you insane, all star system mane
Touch screen, sony thangs, snort about a pound o' caine
Bring you into fame when you fuckin' with this mane
.50 cal will dot the hoes, extra clip out the door
Make you die slow when I let the hollow spit go
Never know yo when it's all I wrote
(?) SWAT Team (?) back up in that hoe
He gon' get me, that's a word in the streets
I keep big heat, he die quickly
Don't fuck with me, my goes "bang bang"
His goes "skee-skee", I'm bipoley
This ain't what you want, trick, when I'm full of funk
Bum with the gun, Koop - originator crunk
25 years of my life time ridin' 'round Memphis with the same damn body in my trunk

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
And then when I shred him I turn on the dread
When I leave him for dead, mozzarella the head
Dig up the spot so the body can rest
When you fuck with me, yes you fuckin' with the best
Murderous thoughts, tombs, plots
Throw 'em in hollow ground, fuck a pine box
.45 cal mag it hit like a ox
As the heat bubble skin like he got chicken pox
Time to play Camela, I will let hammer cock
And yo weak ass will get blown out your socks
Toss me the Glock and I rock it, it's tocks
And his corpse washed up on the fuckin' river rocks
Opportunity knocks when you got money knots
Picture the shit like you got Magnavox
Smith & Wesson impale you while your bitch watch
Yo death time is close on the clock - Tick Tock!

[Verse 3: Lil Loco]
No time for the static
We draw automatics
And raid for you maggots
Blow you off your mattress
And onto your panic
Got blood on your jacket
I wrap you in plastic
You stupid ass bastard
Holdin' you hostage
I shoot up your cottage
I'm not being modest
Don't fuck with my logic
I'm known to be naughty
My favorite hobby
Is (?) the bodies
I'm full on narcotics
I don't give a garbage on talkin' that trash
.44 mag gotcha ass
Blow yo guts against the glass
No need to brag but I'm so bad
Shoot snake venom in yo (?)
And watch how them chemical react

[Verse 4: J-Green]
Killa cap peela comin' out on yo fuckin' street
Seer the Reaper, night crawler, creeper on a fuckin' creep
Dig a ditch, get a bitch, on tha crime we also deep
I'mma take yo head off with this fuckin' street sweep
Leave yo brains in a toilet, pushed of for da quarter key
Take yo wife, snap that hoe, (?) still on creep
Hollywood J with the SK and the Mac-10
On the task with the locs and a skimask
Step up to this mass and you gon' catch a blast my nig
