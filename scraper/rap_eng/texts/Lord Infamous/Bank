There's kinda niggas in this world of ours:
The ones with the money and the ones with power
The ones that can and the ones that can't
So get bank nigga, get bank bitch

[Verse 1: Santerria]
I'm not yo average bitch, I don't care if you live or die
And if I turned pussy then what would they about
I'm still a human being with feelings, sometimes I cry
Then I get back to the money and wipe my fuckin' eye
Wait a second, hold your horses
I'm talkin' Bentleys and Porsches
Pussy ... so known and I don't think you can afford me
I'm a jazzy-ass bitch, there's no way that you can ignore me
My name ringing bells, there's no way that you can avoid me
Santerria's the business, these niggas they gon' support me
Put the pussy game down on the ... absorbed me
Tell 'em get out here and bring me my money
Fuck how you get, dirty money - clean money
Don't matter nigga, I'm with it, I'm a (go-getter)
And if we have some problems I'm a (hoe hitter)
I fuck with those who are to me (beneficial)
My pussy's so ... make ya cry
So here's a tissue, take your money then dismiss ya
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I should never leave my head where I do my dirt
I would never use same product, bitch, that I work
I will always check too see what's up under your shirt
Keep a pistol at all times and I will disperse
Check that nigga pockets, check that hoe purse
Cause doin' twenty years farewell get your feelings hurt
And I never would believe in that fuckin' word "Friends"
But I will believe in power and the dividends
Get a business so I can clean up this traffic
Cause the IRS is askin' "How are you payin' your taxes?"
And I will keep at least three fine attorneys
Cause I do not know when these folks will try to burn me
Don't let your left hand know what your right hand doin'
Don't let that bitch know shit
There's more than one way you screwin'
And I pray to god that he stop me 'fore they catch me
And keep the pot still boilin' before they come fetch me
BLAY!
