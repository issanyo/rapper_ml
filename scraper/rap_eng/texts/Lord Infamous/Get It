[Hook: Mac Montese] 2x
I gots to get it cause I'm with it
No time for the self pity
In this world, it ain't no games
That you playin', then you already
Fall behind, on your grind
Now it's time for us to shine
So just sit back and take notes
We stayin' on your mind

[Verse 1: Mac Montese]
I'm representin' South Memphis, everything I do is different
Best believe I'm on a mission, so you know I gots to get it
It ain't no secret, you done peep it, they smell it cause I keep it
The loud packs stay on me homie even when I feature
It's been a long time in a long grind and still I'm tryin' to get mine
So if you really know you know us playas gonna make it shine
Hell yeah, I'm right back with the same flow Mac had never left
Still kickin' shit with all my guys, I love them till my last breath
"Get money" on my mind, don't hit me wastin' my time
That shit's irrelevant if you ain't down here chasin' dollar $igns
I fuck with go-getter niggas who liftin' weight to packin' triggers
So if you all about yo hustle just holla, we tryin' to get it

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow I'm a country man in your country with the contraband
I'm coming through the culture land
With drums like a damn marching band
Tropicana kilo santa, peeled bananas, black bandana
On the hammer, Lord Montana
I'm a bad mamma jamma
Did the bitch the (?)
Fold him, throw him in the crapper
Once I hit him with a sampler
Smellin' like he need a pamper
Welcome to Soze's butcher shop
I got ribs, livers, limbs, nigga pork chops
Crow's pharmaceuticals, I fill drug prescriptions
Everything from Fentanyl to teflon ammunition
If you beat my prices then I rob my competition
You will come up missin' if my name is ever mentioned
BLAY!

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: II Tone]
Yeah my mind is on another level, haters always talk
I got the resume to prove the facts so bitch I walk the walk
We can get 'em up, I cool ya down
Found by the ditch in Funky Town
I prostitute that white girl, I whip it as she hold me down
Whole team gettin' money, APB is nothin' less
You can see me in the crowd; I got my hood across my chest
You can bargain shop and buy some bab, lookin' for that good
Got the grocerie like Kroger, you can come on through the hood
Magnolia I done told ya, cause a hustle never stop
Got a bitch that count my bread and give me head around the clock
Ain't no secret, if you sleepin' I'mma wake yo ass up
Cause the world is like a pussy; it's about to get fucked

[Hook] 2x
