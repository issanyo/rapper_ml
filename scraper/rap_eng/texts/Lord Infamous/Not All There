[Hook] 2x
I am the Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter (hunter)
I come from the land down under (under)
Some call me tha bloody scarecrow
Bitch be careful, I'm not all there hoe

[Verse 1]
BLAY!
Neptune the nemesis, Infamous pyramid
Don't trust appearances, I am a killer bitch
Hope you're religious, your god, you will visit him
You niggas cool? I can see thru your images
Shakin' ass niggas man why you keep wishin' it?
Seek you fuck niggas with my x-ray vision
Snitchin' ass niggas, I deal with 'em terrible
Castrate and make 'em all swallow their testicles
Hunt 'em down until they are dead or a vegetable
Methods of torture, mane they unmeasurable
Infamous, Keyzer or Scarecrow Tha Terrible
Mutilate tactics, mane they are unbearable
Vital signs, I make 'em all cease immediately
Pull out the carbine and blast it repeatedly
Come to your funeral and spit on your corpse
Psychotic nigga, the fuck is remorse?
Everyone wittin' the sound of my voice
Shoot up a bitch, anyone of your choice
AK will rumble like it's some damn thunder
Infamous' venomous like a black mamba
Rappers fuckin' with the Scarecrow avoid
Say the damn shit that gets me annoyed
Actors these days ain't nothin' but rappers
Rappers these days ain't nothin' but actors
These pussy niggas mane they ain't a factor
Rip off the skin, call me Lord body snatcher
Mane you don't wanna get caught on tha rapture
Enemies perish, thy massacre master
Call up the feds tell 'em there is disaster
There's nothin' left of the lil bastards
Tried to escape but you can't avoid capture
Guess I will meet your ass in the life after

[Verse 2]
Sawed off double barrel leaves a bloody message
Look there on the ground, those are your intestines
Some say to Lucifer, Scarecrow pledge allegiance
Cut off all your limbs and make you fuckin' quadriplegic
I do not go murder niggas for particular reasons
Something in Scarecrow might snaps and then it's nigga-season
I don't understand why you keep crying, begging, pleadin'
Nothing you can say can prevent you from getting beaten
I been up 4 days my nose is draining on this Bogota
Put your face onto the curb and stomp your fuckin' jaw off
When I'm on this Panama man Scarecrow get real ratchet raw
I commit these deadly feat niggas never ever saw
Dahmer, Son of Sam and Manson told me I be goin' off
Scarecrow is the Zodiac, I leave no trace, I can't be caught
Fuck around, you want to nigga ain't got my dinero
I'll visit your family, you see I ain't all there ho
