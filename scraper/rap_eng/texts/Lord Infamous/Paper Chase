[Hook: Fatal] 2x
When it's on then it's on, it can't be erased
Tear Da Club Up Thugs and Fatal, we on a Paper Chase

[Verse 1: Fatal]
Never wastin' em
Had a slug bug chasin' em
Spin em before they spun
The M-1, close-casin' em
Defacin em like county property
He'd die for me
Spittin' on your whole image, I rob you and make a mockery
Yo ya see that party by Haus Cucasimenas
Trife on that ass
Who better hit the ground fizast
Fuck that financially
Fatal stable satanically
Mash on your little stash niggas testin' the family
Play the eddie cane with your petty game
Breakin' ya un-ready friend when you fuck with who-freddy sein
Nigga dip off blood, I get that back and let the free fall
Hit ya with six shots, let you in bail ass hits off
Fatal Hussein, from the cradle to the grave
Tokin' like big Suge till every label know my name
And they ask 'Whats up with Yak and who shot Pac?
And who rode on you tryin' to test the block'

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
What the fuck!
Those niggas bailin out of range rovers
Lucky Louisiana, lucky as a fuckin fully clothed camera boy
The cast there, hangin mother fucker sat there
Sayin now she was a tear da little homies at chess game
Dodge all my life, these niggas no good the trigger man
Fatal flaw man from another hood doin yeah
Those are the rules in this mafia race
Tear Da Club up Thugs mash down on a g-string...

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
When we drop
Always keep them cocked
Make them things pop
On the block
Niggas never stop
Tryin’ to run cops
Out the hood, Niggas no good
Ridin’ in the wood
With the grain, fatal hussein
Gonna bring the pain
Put the coo to your 40 brew
Robbers on the loose
Nothing new cuz we let em out
If we fight or shoot
All you hoes weak
And I know do you wanna roll
With these thugs livins
In the blood ghetto hesito foo

Break out artillery, hide the mother fuckin' product

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Now it is time to get rough with the drama
Bitches you cannot escape from the hunter
Evil scarecrow
Devil spells go
Deep in my soul
Blood on my clothes
Criminal hands and I must squeeze a weapon
Listen to sounds of the lead when we steppin'
Infamous comes from the south territory
Listen to some of my demonic poetry
Circles of Triple Six men smokin' ganja
Ritual with dead bodies on the furniture
So many soldiers are coming to destroy ya
Six million sinister satanic warriors
Ill still, feel drill, will kill, nina-milli, flame a philly
I will fill the enemy with about twenty slugs
To the mug, one more trick in the mud quick
I want all my Tear Da Club Up Thugs to rip this shit
