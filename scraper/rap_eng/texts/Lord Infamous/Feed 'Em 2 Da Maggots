[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
I'm baggin' 'em, I'm taggin' 'em, feed 'em to the maggots
Spill a faggots cabbage, I'm (?) savage
Executioner, I'll drop yo head in a basket
This arsenal will make you ashes like a fire dragon

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
(?) murderer, blood on the the pentagram
I am the Son of the Sam
The Green River killer, the satanic nigga
You enter the mind of the massacre nigga
... coffin
The 20 gauge sawed off to blow off yo jaw
When I'm blowin' a ounce of bolivian rock
And sippin' on yo bloody broth
Murder more niggas than holocaust
Plasma sauce, limbs lost
Fatal the injuries you are receivin'
Get hit with the (?) of the Infamous wars
Bitches fill they mouth from this reptile from the nile
Crow the predator on the prowl - hydrocodone crocodile
Launchin' your head into orbit
Hundred round drum and I make you absorb it
No facial features, you look kinda morbid
Slaughter your family and make you record it
At the damn funeral playin' the organ
Niggas don't want no damn part of this torment
With these slugs niggas soarin'
Keep the parking lot dormant

[Verse 2: Youngin]
You pussy niggas be killin' me
Your brains on the floor what they finna see
Got a hitlist for my enemies
When I kill 'em slow trick, then I watch 'em bleed
I told you before, ain't gon' stoppin' me
You crossed the line (?)
Lord forgive me as they beg and plead
As my hand on the trigger, I fucking squeeze
Youngin unload on that mofo
That sawed-off, that's a big hoe
Then I ball off on a bankroll
Gotta get go, gotta lay low
Nigga, yeah, you ain't no killa
Fuck around bitch, have yo head gone nigga
Killin' shit, no witnesses
Youngin - Manson

[Hook: Lord Infamous]

[Verse 3: Advocate]
I walk up to yo eyes
My hitlist (?) numeral
I pay ya funeral
Got my glass (?) like a pessimist
Hoe you should have never messed with this
In a legion now, like an exorcist
Bitch I hope you rest in piss
Severed appendages, tendons and ligaments
Like Mortal Kombat a fatal (?)
Facial disfigurement, your death is imminent
(?) comin', you can not get rid of it
Advocate, Youngin and Infamous
Leavin' 'em (?)
Slaughter the (?)
And they last sentences
...
Venomous nemesis, this is my genesis

[Outro, repeating]
Feed 'em to da maggots
