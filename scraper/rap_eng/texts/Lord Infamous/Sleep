[Intro: Juicy J]
Please stay sleep, please stay sleep
Please stay sleep, you niggas stay sleep

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Sippin' on six murdered ministers' sauce, salty blood from the cup that they call Holy Grail
Silenced for singin' so many sick songs of a place they call heaven, now skitzo broke hell
Restin' upon my black throne and I'm spyin' on suspicious suspects while sittin' on souls
Sinister schemes I decided distract on a ancient crucial past voodoo and scrolls
Satanic insignia wrote on the scene it's so sacred created by Lucifer slaves
Silent, secluded in secret somewhere in the swamp in the land of old testament days
Infinite SIX, eternal the SIX, forever the SIX, I sits outta the flames
Sick minded soldiers wit suffering, singing and searching to stable severe forms of pain
Scarecrow was me, I was sent from the (?) scorn with the thorn on my venomous tips
Such innocent antisocial, my there is no sun daily as the rain wipes from my lips
Indulge yourself with the poisons and noises, money and drugs, material goals
I tell you how is the profit of man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul

[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
I click so quick, my spells are slick
I'm comin' again with much more
You niggas be jealous cuz my profit sellin'
Its fucking yo bitch but Nig-ga-roes
Just listen, I shouldn' have to mention
Yo ass is in the click, you fell in the click
Cuz you run yo mouth around the wrong misses bitch
Yo peep this, my niggas be packin' artillery
Making yo ass whine
I'm packin' this bomb ass car
That's robbin yo ass blind all the time
You think I love you, never nigga I'm out to get my cheese
Like Roger Rabbit, who framed the nigga
That guy left on his knees?
Smokin' out, cuz I need to get high before I go on my mission
My profit soldiers call me all about this thing called pimpin'
So listen nigga before you think you got a convict (bitch)
You got a steaming matter lil' boy that want the lifestyle of rich

[Hook]
Sleep baby sleep, Three 6 is on the creep
Beware of this Klan, Prophet is just too deep
Sleep baby sleep

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
We creepin' up on these hoes wit the Mac-10, the Mac-12
Hit 'em wit the Mac-11, catch ya slippin at the 7-11
Put the swords in the back of his cap
Send him straight to heaven 7
?Lily villains? couldn't stop these hits
Certainly when ya fuck around wit da Three Six
Mafia on top a ya
Game, really gotta wake 'em up wit the piggy bank
Really tho, sissy ho, we up in ya house
Boo under da bed, Crunchy behind da couch
Get 'em up wit galled off
Wit da mother fucking shit we talkin' about
Thug'd out, drugged out, already
Get 'em in they mother fucking sleep like Freddy
Split it, doin' it, them mutha fuckin niggas doin' it
Pourin' it, the mutha fuckin Posse bitch
While you thinking we slackin' up, we jackin' up yo fuckin shit
Enemies from day one, but today sons, don't last, so ball it
Where ya run at? Da Three Six gun that
All bitches about the cheap
Hangin low and standin' hi, stayin' hi, on the mutha fuckin street

[Verse 4: Crunchy Black]
Should I let a nigga live?
Should I let a nigga die?
I should watch a nigga cry
While I sing dem lullaby
As da tears hit the floor
Dealin' shit, how not a roar?
Crunchy Black is not a whore
And Raven Red and heavens door
As I soar through yo life
You be beggin' for some Christ
Ain't no mutha fuckin' Christ
All I wanna see is die

[Verse 5: Juicy J]
Yo sleep at night
We coming through yo mutha fuckin' window pane
Make sure at night, you shut it tight
So the killer won't split ya brain
Don't make a move in ya room
You better believe it's a big surprise
Nuttin but them two like a Glock
Boy a sick infrared between ya eyes
Tie that bitch up wit the gray tape
Rest of the body wrap it up wit a belt
Chop, chop, chop, cut the dead body up
Till ya know theres nothing left
Please stay sleep!

[Hook] 2x
Sleep baby sleep, Three 6 is on the creep
Beware of this Klan, Prophet is just too deep
Sleep baby sleep
