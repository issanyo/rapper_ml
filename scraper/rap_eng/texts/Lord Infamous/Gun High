[Hook] 2x
I'm in this bitch gettin' gun high, yep, gun high
I can't get right without my damn get-right
I can't take fight if I ain't got my supply
You niggas ain't tight, mane you need some get-right

[Verse 1]
Scarecrow keep ... like (?)
Make your hoe frisky, skeet on her teeth
She need to taste your nuts
Straight from these real coca leafs
Your jaws drop, your eyes on high beam
Catch you out the streets I'm in and the carbine 15 will beam
Social animosity, I spray you like some (?)
(?) this thing, the heat burnin' me 3rd degree
Hope you got a platoon full of goons, Lord got mercenaries
Keyser barbarian, great white bull terrier
Murderous veteran, rigor mortis settin' in
Make your ass a vegetable, cut off yo damn testicles
Way to late for medical, cut off like umbilical
Your credit not credible, carnivorous, you edible

[Hook] 2x
I'm in this bitch gettin' gun high, yep, gun high
I can't get right without my damn get-right
I can't take fight if I ain't got my supply
You niggas ain't tight, mane you need some get-right

[Verse 2]
You're not formidable, it is so critical
Petty and pityful, pray for a miracle
It's not forgivable, I am a (?)
Infamous nigga I get at with you
C4 is amazing - blow your house out the foundation
Get them damn machetes and hack you up like them haitians
Beat you, grab you, choke her, stab you
Shoot you, drag you, burn you to ash fool
Bitch nigga I ain't got no show
I walk up in your church
Shoot you while you catch the holy ghost

[Hook] 2x
I'm in this bitch gettin' gun high, yep, gun high
I can't get right without my damn get-right
I can't take fight if I ain't got my supply
You niggas ain't tight, mane you need some get-right
