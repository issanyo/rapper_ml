[Hook: T-Rock] 2x
Pass me a cup, I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Pass me a cup, I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
Somebody tell me where da weed at
Then I get some feedback
I'm goin' through some chemical reactions like I need that
If it ain't a cigarillo pimp I break da bong out
It's Mr. 420 himself, I'm smokin' Cheech N Chong out
A quarter P of purrp, sold a bag of two crystal white
Blow my brain away on hay, I'm feelin' cool as Lipton Ice
Pour up the Patrón pimpin' everthing I sip is white
Somethin' 'bout that alcohol, it go good with that Kryptonite
If you wanna ...
Every song is soundin' super fire
Makin'me leanin' right
Cause when I know I'm super throwed
My timin' is super slow
Ridin' in a Maserati
Switching gear to cruise control
I got flavors, take a look:
White willow, blue berry kush
I (?) chocolate (?) right off the bush
My mind is propellin'
I feel like I need Excedrin
But fuck over-the-counter stuff
I just go get my medicine, smoke one

Pass me a cup, I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Pass me a cup, I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
When I grab the pad and pencil, oh it's so essential
That the Scarecrow show you bitch ass niggas
My credentials
Phrases and these metaphors, I use 'em as utensils
Like a butcher knife, I carve in corpses my initials
Like I said before, a nigga life ain't worth a nickle
Sicker than them niggas with the celt they call sickle
Toss you in the pond and hit the num-num water ripple
Only way you walkin' out this bitch is dead or crippled
When I walk into the room it's cold and hard nipples
Wicked shit is complicated, you niggas too simple
Bullets and uranium, so many nuclear missiles
Comin' like Al Qaida so put up your little pistols
Paranoid as hell, I been up days on this crystal
Pop you like a pimple through the middle with the sickle
When a nigga talkin' shit the Lord is gettin' tickled
So far I ain't dumb, he an opponent that's formidable

(Nigga) Pass me a cup
I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Pass me a cup
I need Patrón with this weed smoke
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'
Don't stop, keep it comin'

[Verse 3: Mac Montese]
See I been sippin' on Patróne
And now I'm startin' to feel real loose
Everybody in this club around me
Start to look like fools
Who the fuck you think is this?
I been smokin' on this shit
I (?) the blunt of kush and lit it
Then I passed it to my bitch
Shit I stay smokin' good
Cause I'm straight up out the hood
It's too fire for a (?)
Gram of that OG and I roll it good
Pass me the cup
I need Patróne with my weed smoke
First inhale, then exhale
If you choke that's good dope
