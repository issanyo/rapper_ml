[DJ Paul talking]

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
50 bands in a duffle bag, nigga that's a bundle
I blast on a nigga ass like we in the jungle
Niggas talk that shit but they still ain't doin' numbers
They ass better be glad that a nigga on a come up

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Why you niggas wanna hate on a (?) like me
You gettin' money, I'm gettin' money while we (?)
Probably cause them groupie ass niggas be wearin' yo ear out
But everyone of them niggas can see how I clear my clips out
I ain't 'bout that mouth, unless it's 'bout a bitch
Cause the Glock 19 round full of metal clips
Alot of these rappers (?), alot of these rappers are phony
Alot of these rappers be rappin' 'bout niggas that homies
(?)

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
(?) niggas but you never fuckin' with Lord Soze
Spittin' verses with these curses then I get my way
I ain't takin' no more losses, nigga get my way
Sweet and sugar-coated but you just Frosted Flakes
Tell yo bitch to go home, I skeeted in her face
I get high until I'm comatose, I dope all day
Buyin' drugs, buy the (?), I buy bricks by weight
Scarecrow, Rowdy Bounty Hunter, Mafia 6ix

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I'ma rob me some nigga then I'm right back to that money
I'm hittin' me a cup then I'm right back to that money
I'm catchin' nigga hoe then I'm right back to that money
Just like big brother Bill, I be right back to that money
I ain't playin' no game, I'm chasin' my money
I'm catchin' a witness, then bag it up honey
(?) no tens and no twenties in my stacks
Ain't nothin' but them hunnids and that's (?)

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
I got charged for some bullshit that I didn't do
Nigga two hunnid thou bond and fucked up you
Koopsta Knicca locked up and let it go for yo head
Even told my main bitch everything I said
At the (?) we just busted, he thought it was funny
Hooked up with Da Mafia 6ix and got right back on that money
Now all of a sudden I come around me for
And yo big homie OG oldschool brother
