[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous is comin' strapped like an Italian-Arabic-
Iraqie-Iranian-South American
Cuban-guerilla-colombian-muslim or subgroup maniac
Comin' to rip your damn head off your neck
Put your heart in a bag, then I sprinkle yo ashes
Headin' straight to tha headquarter
Chief on the blunt of the Indica down in my stash
I reside in the insane asylum
The bodies I pile 'em
On Infamous Island
Where there is no smilin'
The niggas buck-wildin'
The weapons are silenced
There's nothing but violence
Military barbarian, buck 'em and bury 'em
Fuck with the scarier insanitarium, pallbearer carry 'em
There's no merry love, only murder blood
Then I take something worst
Out of all of these hollow points burst in disperse
Going through flesh and bone through the back of your shirt
You be burnt up and buried in dirt that'll work
The Scarecrow be smokin' these niggas for shit
They can't get wid these bitches they'll never compare
I'm comin' from the land of Triple 6 niggas
Still sufferin' every day man, I swear

I see them fuckin' press, oh no they better lay
It happens everyday don't make me grab the guage
Dangerously I play, I blast out yo rib cage
And lay ya body in the back of that grey Chevrolet

[Hook: Jae-Jo & Scarecrow] 2x
Jae-Joe and the Scarecrow creepin' at night
Taking your soul, we gonna let you die slow BLAY!
Jae-Jo and the Scarecrow, Jae-Jo and the Scarecrow
The Jae-Jo and Scarecrow BLAY!

[Verse 2: Jae-Jo]
J to the ae, J to the O, you better don't fuck with me
Cause I gotta be hunting your soul
Taking control of your life
Spirits and demons are walking with me
Taking yo vital signs, creepin' at night
I be buckin' and blastin' on sight
Take up and you ride in my trunk
So what the fuck you want from me
You better move out of my way
When you see me in the streets
Or I gonna hit you with my Tec, I'm aimin' for yo knees
Let you bleed, I drag you home and kill you slow
Like it is easy you gotta be ended up under the concrete
Leavin' yo family cryin' cause they can't find you
So better keep lookin' behind you
If you wanna mess with me, you messin' with a beast
So come and test me, I'm feeding yo soul to my demons
So you (?) rest and they be fiendin', I'll be (?) my chest
It's a murder season and I'm livin' a bloody mess
You be layin' in a pool of blood cause I'm stressed
You shouldn't fuck with a thug cause I will fill you full of slugs
And you can't fuck with that

[Hook: Jae-Jo & Scarecrow] 2x
Jae-Joe and the Scarecrow creepin' at night
Taking your soul, we gonna let you die slow BLAY!
Jae-Jo and the Scarecrow, Jae-Jo and the Scarecrow
The Jae-Jo and Scarecrow BLAY!
