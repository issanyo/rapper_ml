[Intro]
Im 'bout to put it in they face (8x)

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
Wyte Music, we do this, we kicks it so foolish
Got a .40 cal ridin' in my waist, I'm bout to put it in your face, what the fuck you gonna do with it?
Will I drop the ball? Never, my hands are made of superglue
Got our all star team still pickin' up the recruits while eatin' sushi food
I'm on that Triple 6, DJ Paul and Juicy J shit
The beats are slammin', the flows are jammin' and we on that gettin' paid shit
The Scarecrow will run up all the flocks of jealous haters
Who ever is left will gain all the paper with me and my makers
The underboss is how you adress me in the time being
Till the day I am crowned, then that's when you call me king
I have always kept it real with anybody in the place
With all that said I think its time I put it in yo fucking face
Its overdue, I'm underrated and never overdosin'
Lord Infamous is the closest I've ever been to a ghost
You get that, I ain't dead bitch and neither is he
We well alive right now in the studio and we eatin' these beats

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Get yo ass lost without a trace, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
Bitch niggas we eliminate, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
You niggas fake for satans sake, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
When I see you at your wake, I'm 'bout to put it in they face

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Infamous back and I'm meant for the (?) and I castrate dogs or you niggas who bark
You faggots posin' no threat, I'm a samurai taking yo head off the chopping block
Lord Infamous Vader or Soze Obi-Wan Kenobi, lightsaber removin' your top
Now my flow is cocaine, it's da bogota runnin' ... panama jawlock
Scarecrow tha terrible (?) rock, scatter like roaches and get off the block
Don't use the kevlar, our boys usin metal, the .50 cal spottin' your head from afar
Crow Keyser the equalizer, yeah you niggas just appetizers
Trick I rip off your damn visor, you don't add up you get minus
When this dope turn down my sinus ain't no search party can find ya
Bodies sought to my wild forts, they got them K-9's, they will find ya
Infamous cannibalistic for blood and I come with the (?) and the swingblade and mufflin' taters
Roll in the door (?) disintegrating to vapors
The Devil Shyt very contagious, the art of war ran out of pages
The Infamous rock up the ages, you niggas can't play with the mages
Come play in the Black Rain and my club house where corpses hang
Where hearses been take aim and voodoo dolls dance in the flames

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Get yo ass lost without a trace, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
Bitch niggas we eliminate, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
You niggas fake for satans sake I'm 'bout to put it in they face
When I see you at your wake, I'm 'bout to put it in they face
