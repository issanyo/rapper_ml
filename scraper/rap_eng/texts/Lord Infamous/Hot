[Intro]
Yeah I'm hot, yeah I'm hot
Yeah I'm hot

[Verse 1: Mac Montese]
Yeah I'm hot like the devils pitch fork
I burn they ass, folks stay low-key
I'm smokin' dolo behind the window
My kinfolks stay all high
Pitch forks up in the sky
Don't be surprised when we roll by
We might come through and set up shop
Knockin' out the competition
Showin' 'em all what they been missin'
Here you get alotta cake
They goin' bread plus bacon and spinach
Winnin' while I'm sinnin', got demons on my fuckin' mind
I'm hopin' to make it another month on this hustle grind
You don't wanna see me, these niggas they wanna be me
Plus they hoes wanna G me, it's yo boy Mac Montese
These suckers throwin' pebbles, we spittin' heavy metal
Yeah that hot shit, top notch shit, you can't do it no better

[Hook: Mac Montese] 2x
We hotter than the devil
You niggas ain't our level
You can reach us with a shovel
Cause we always goin' (?)
While these suckers throwin' pebbles
We spittin' heavy metal
Yeah that hot shit, top notch shit
You can't do it no better

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Strike 'em with da fangs of the Lycan, light 'em with da hammer
Thick mamma jamma of (?) with montana
Purple mixed with Fanta got me hyped up in the back of the Phantom
Make you shit your pampers when I hit you with a lethal sample
Uppercut like Evander, Lord is walkin' with a panther
Quickly blowin' out yo candle, knock you out yo fuckin' sandals
Slice you like a samurai, test your fuckin' stamina
Fuck you up on camera, I'm Tommy Lee, you Pamela
Soze, I'm the damager, you deal with death, I'll manage ya
Amazon stun gun, coke-a-ton in the rough
Huff and puff and hit the dust
Leavin' your body somewhere in the rust
Get ya head rushed, lead bust and spill a fags guts

[Hook: Mac Montese] 2x

[Verse 3: II Tone]
Yeah I'm hated by you hoes but I'm loved in my city
All the critics kiss my ass and all the shit that came with it
Make your heart stop, brain pop, explosion from the fucking Glock
Ratta-tatta-tatta on your ass till your body drop
Hotter than the flames of hell, burnin' like the damn son
Little burn smokin' (do you really wanna get this on?)
Peace is for pussy, let me walk into the light
Where them serpents dwell in hell and claimin' dogs after life
Slit yo finger with a razor, write yo name with the blood
Say "I pray to Lucifer" and join the satanism club
I'm tired of you niggas that sayin' you're real
I'm pissing on your grave spot
24/7 youre hatin' the mack and this is why you bitches hot

[Hook: Mac Montese] 2x
