[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I been had hard from the start, that’s on god nigga
Don’t get yo ass robbed after dark for that hard, bitch
You niggas know I mob through your hood with them headcuttas
Give you niggas the business with them mothafuckin headbussas

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I was a trapper 'fore they call that shit trap
Sellin' lines of blow till I flow lines of rap
I come from the Haven, it's a small hood perhaps
We knockin' niggas out and fuckin' they bitches 'till they nap
We ridin' through da hood with them cameras on our lap
I call em cameras cause they shoot when a nigga 'bout to snap
Snap crackle and pop, that blow got me unlockin' shit
Ride up on your block, Glocks cock, we 'bout to rock you tricks

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
Nigga know me - it's C.B
Nigga know I rob, nigga know I'm street
Catch a nigga slippin', hit him with the heat
Beat his ass up like a DJ Paul beat
Ten toes down, ain't no fuckin with me
If they fuckin' with me, I'mma leave 'em in the street
Leave his ass laid out on the concrete
Leave his ass laid on the ground like ground beef

[Hook: DJ Paul] 2x
I been had hard from the start, that’s on god nigga
Don’t get yo ass robbed after dark for that hard, bitch
You niggas know I mob through your hood with them headcuttas
Give you niggas the business with them mothafuckin headbussas

[Beat Change]

[Verse 3: Koopsta Knicca]
Player's be watching watching
Haters cock blocking blocking
Bass be bouncing bouncing
All around the block block
Ain't no blocking blocking
44 knocking knocking
Y'all can't stop me stop me
Bitch don't get popped at, popped at
Hard knock school school
I'm so rude rude
Wicked interlude-lude
All them dead fool
Pump they head head
Got these hoes scared scared
So much lead lead
PUT EM IN THE RED

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
I was talkin' to Koop and Paul, tellin' them how I remember
How they used to terrorize the city, bustin' with them triggers
Lotta haters, then got greater later, always have the paper
So I never worried bout it cause our hitters will erase ya
And it's cool like that, we got hard like that
I ain't braggin' I'm just statin' true facts like that
I ain't never been scared, I be sayin' what they can't
And I wish I nigga would say that shit up to my face

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Hell, it has no fury, I will make your vision blurry
You will come up missing surely, body found in the Missouri
Knock (?) you say heroin and crack must pay my tax
Baseball bats knock out your cataracts and cut off your nutsacks
I will send them goons and niggas with them bloody toolies nigga
You will get disfigured, critically injured and corpse dismembered
Speedin' like I'm nitrous, rob and pillage like them vikings
Scarecrow raw Tennessee Titan, rob that nigga; I don’t like him
