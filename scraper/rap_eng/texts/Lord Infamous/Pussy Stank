[Hook] 2x
Pussy stank; I want bank
I want that paper, that fold and not that clink clank
Give me your debit card, maybe your charge card
Sell your body, rob, do your job, get my knob

[Verse 1]
My name is Lord Infamous, the bloody bloody Scarecrow
Bitch you can't kick rocks
You ain't got a (?) strapped to yo hole
You want me to do what, when, where, why
Who you think I am?
My mack is relentless, I break yo ass down till you penniless given up tramp
I don't give a damn 'bout yo little pussy gettin' damp
Pay a fee to get this D, don't get me amped
I start fire from yo ass, come sign up for my slut class
But there is a small tuition and a few conditions
I want 90 percent out of everything you get
But I break it down to 60 if you got a few kids
Don't get it twisted trick, all pimps ain't merciless
No I'm lyin' like a motherfucker, give it all up bitch
I'mma give it to her raw, a ear full of this ISM
This pure uncut pimpin', realism, this ISM
And if you violate go to the whole stockade
Till you hit that fuckin' blade and a bank get made

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2]
Nigga don't you take that loss
Better get you a bank up out that broad
Not something, not half, yes I want all
Your contribution the the cost
Bitch are you out of your rabbit ass mind?
Tryin' to say you don't have all of mine
Sex ain't free, bitch I need cheese
Motherfuck you dignifiying
Tell me what's her purpose?
She can't make no paper surface
Put her head up on the chopping block
And tell that hoe it's curtains
It ain't workin', I can jerk it if I wanna get a nut
Better go and crease a trick
And get some work in here you slut
It ain't gotta be all cheese; I take drank, coke and pills
Niggas put they self in danger, tryin' to catch a munchie thrill
What's the deadly hoe, are you fuckin' slow
Don't you need some dope?
Yo ass in the air anyway, you ain't gotta do it broke
I came to bring some hope, shed some light, get yo mind right
Hoe you gonna be alright, all you need's a sticker price
It's time for a change, let's get up some fuckin' change
Not no damn chump change, pussy stank; I want bank

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3]
You can grant all a macks wishes
With that body that's so vicious
Come and soak you up some pimpin'
That'll keep that pussy drippin'
I ain't trippin', I'm just tryin' to get a product to the masses
This particular item cost with some fire cap
And some fat asses
And this shit that's goin' down
Since the good Lord hit the switch
Nigga tryin' to make a profit from between yo legs bitch
You ain't innocent, better try to better your predicament
Slut yo ass ain't happy 'less you suckin' on a dickery
Or some of it, I love a booshie bitch with a bank account
Take 'em out and dick her down, see can I get a nice amount?
So what's yo donation to this mack foundation?
Make a small contribution if you want some stimulation
Like my nigga Chuck say, yo, and I quote
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes
But Scarecrow can't go, yo I want my scrilla
Give it all here bitch 'fore a nigga go gorilla

[Hook] 2x
