[Hook: Lord Infamous] x2
Like my nigga Chuck say, yo, and I quote
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes, these hoes

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Infamous, when I'm approachin' a bitch
I don't come at that ho with no chivalry
I'm having that bitch going off and damn
Must a bitch have all my dough on delivery?
Might as well get the shit out of your head
No escape, you can't get yourself rid of this G
So walk yo' ass on down that boulevard, bitch
And don't come back unless you got all of my cheese
I will pull out this damn .44 mag
And I will give your fuckin' head injury
Ho, I must tell ya, I won't lose no damn sleep
After givin' yo' head a crease
Keyser Soze is a savage, hell no man
I'm more like a rabbit, this African beast
And when I start grippin' this fuckin' MAC-90
I will leave your body damn scattered in pieces

[Verse 2: La Chat]
These niggas think they pimpin' but really, they be the bitches
Won't you tell the truth? You and your friend is on my trick list
Chat, I be the pimp, I be the mack, all that
I be the bitch you buyin' them Lacs
Be that bitch you brang them stacks, yeah
And I don't love you boy, you already know the business
I barely like you but I love your finger-lickin'
Yeah, you the baller type, you wanna make a bitch a wife
You ain't my type, I give you a night, that's if you payin' right
Your credit card the only thing that makes my nipple hard
I swear you rather catch a charge before you let me charge
Cause I'm a dirty bitch, fuck that shit, might charge the trick
And, if his bitch ass wanna fuck, then charge his ass to jack his dick
See, I get paper from these niggas on a daily basis
And I'on't fuck 'em but I'm quick to ride these niggas' faces
La Chat that bitch, I know you heard of me, lame
I'm acceptin' applications, won't you come be my mane?

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
To say the least
I'm showin' a once-a-month bleedin' bitch no sympathy
Turn her upside down and shake it up till it all is empty
Scarecrow can show you no pity, punk-bitch
I want your punk ass pantyless
Murderous Memphis maniac
And I love to take hoes' innocence
Bounce some pimpin' on some gangsta shit
What's a relationship?
Send a bitch across the country
To bring back my fuckin' grip
I can give a fuck about your sad ass puppy dog eyes
Bitch, you better get somewhere
And open up your fuckin' thighs
