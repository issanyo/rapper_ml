[Verse1:Lord Infamous]
Marijuana chiefin' blazes keepin' the Scarecrow way up in the rainbows
Ev'ry mornin' sippin' a quart with the key of the weed in the punch bowl
Grab me a couple of sheets of the big banana leafs
Ready the stalk-a that kills like a stock on a Nigga I'm full o ' the dark green
Smokin' got me coughin' smokin' legizaree often
Staggerin' like a real drunk muthafucka
I think im too high for this walkin'
My head started spinnin'
I feel a bit crazy can't keep the world still
And the smoke the shits no joke
My niggas know thats on the real
Homies know just where its at
Niggas keepin' fat contacts
Stout sacks pounds of that
Muthafuckin' chicken black
Pour me a glass of the Hennessy yeah
Inhale 'til I shed a tear get a chair
Then I begin to soar deep in the atmosphere
Passin' and rollin' grunges like a major mackin'
Damn DJ Paul my nig' im smoked out
Here you take it cause im full o' that weed
Man let the track thump
Still I end up yellin' to my nigga smoke a junt

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Gotta keep plenty bud dry can't let the shit drought
Scarecrow and Killaman rollin' wit' da best out
Must lick this shit player why you wanna save it player?
My nigga you stop-a the chiefin' that buddy for keepin'
Put that shit in the air
Ev'rybody breakin' sacks empty out the whole bag
Roll the shit up and then we passin' round the weed
Nasty bunch of niggas standin' 'round gettin' hell polluted
You wanna get fucked up the reefers undisputed
Strangers wallkin' up and
Smell the pure and wanna get a hit
You wanna get-a dose-a of-a mingy?
Best pay tribute trick!
Scarecrow dont give a fuck gotta let the nature blaze
Triple 6 Mafia fire the bud up while we on the stage
Loungin' in the back gettin' fucked up right before a show
Ridin outta town smoked a ounce in back o' the limo
Thought this shit is over mayne I think I smoked a thousand blunts
Still I end up yellin' to my nigga Black "Smoke a junt
Smoke a junt!"
