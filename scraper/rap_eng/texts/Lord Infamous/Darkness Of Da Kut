[Intro]
Lord Infamous, Da Mystical One
Keyser Soze
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
From the Land down under
Motherfucker
The King of this Horrorcore shit
You know it bitch
I hope one of you niggas try to fuck with me
I wish one of you niggas would fuck with this shyt
I'm a Killa ho

[Hook] 2x
In the Darkness Of Da Kut
A vial of cocaine and some cigarette butts
A fully loaded carbine and a 500 chrome
Waiting for this bitch nigga to bring
His ass home, yeah

[Verse 1]
BLAY!
I got a date tonight, but ain't got no appetite
But this bitch he will be dining on slugs from the 1-5
Bloody bloody scarecrow, call me rowdy bounty hunter
I'ma try to split this bitch from his skull to his stomach
I don't fuck around with niggas, but I love to play with triggers
I'll take this machete and I'll leave your punk ass disfigured
Blood pools formin' on the floor
Fucking brain fragments on the motherfucking door
Goddamn you picked the wrong nigga to make war
Bitch haven't you heard that Lord the King Of Horrorcore?
Even once you have entered the state of rigor mortis
Everything is distorted when I'm playing with your organs

[Hook] 2x
In the Darkness Of Da Kut
A vial of cocaine and some cigarette butts
A fully loaded carbine and a 500 chrome
Waitin' for this bitch nigga to bring his ass home, yeah

[Verse 2]
First everything turns blood red
Then I walk up and put 6 shots in his head
Then I hang his body on some fucking meat hooks
Tryin' to figure out which body part should I cook
Gut him like a hog like Memphis in may
Shouldn't have fucked with soze on that bay
Bitch I gotta whole lot a motherfucking issues
Trick you better hope that Lord Infamous don't pick you
Put yo ass in the trunk, drive you to the swamp
I'll cremate ya dump yo ashes in the city dump
I'm in the darkness of the motherfucking cut
An a few lines waitin for ya punk ass to slip up

[Hook] 2x
In the Darkness Of Da Kut
A vial of cocaine and some cigarette butts
A fully loaded carbine and a 500 chrome
Waitin' for this bitch nigga to bring his ass home, yeah
