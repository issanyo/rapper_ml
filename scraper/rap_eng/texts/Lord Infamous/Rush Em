[Skit from the movie "Menace II Society"]

[Hook: Partee]
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em

Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin'  shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I'm 'bout to get stupid-dumb-retarded-ignorant
Smack you so hard I will knock out your pigments
Satan is all you saw (?)
Have you on your knees repentin'
Pray to God, better get some religion
Right in the cut, peripheral vision
When the Lord Infamous go on a mission
I get on the face, man that face is missin'
Stompin' your face in and widen your jaw
Don't make me get full of that coca raw
I'm a juggernaut on tussin' snot, mane, let's rob
Poppin' the clip and I'm ready to rip
I'm plannin' on takin' out all o' yall
Then visit the church or mall
When Infamous full of that bogota
Slugs is dispersin', niggas heads burstin'
Lord's blood thirsty, who want to converse me?
Out of time, you fuckin' with a mind of my kind
I beat 'em, bust 'em, no discussion
When the Infamous start to rush 'em

[Bridge]
Lord the rabid werewolf at full moon fiendin' for jugulars
Infamous vampire, suck up plasma like a cherry slush
Sittin' in the pentagram, candle is summonin' the spirits
Train me in black masters, they cop my mind with these demonic lyrics

[Hook: Partee]
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em

Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin'  shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
I'm the Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter, Lord of voodoo
I'm the one that taught the art of war to fuckin' Sun Tzu
Searchin' through my books of curses, who be next to catch the hex?
If I felt your bitchass once a threat I sever head from neck
Crow's a great white shark from lurkin' in the deep blue
I'm smellin' chomp-chomp-chomp time for the feedin' frenzy food
Silverback Gorilla charge 'em, rippin' off appendages
Ain't no need for beg and pleadin', bitch that shit is gibberish
Visions of ancestors mummifiyin' tricks in pyramids
Sociopathic with the automatic, death's your only wish
Back in the old days I used to scream "I gotta touch 'em!"
Now it's (?) first we rush 'em then I gut 'em

[Bridge]
Lord the rabid werewolf at full moon fiendin' for jugulars
Infamous vampire, suck up plasma like a cherry slush
Sittin' in the pentagram, candle is summonin' the spirits
Train me in black masters, they cop my mind with these demonic lyrics

[Hook: Partee]
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em

Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin'  shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit

[Verse 3: Partee]
Murder on my mind, I got the vision, I can see it
Strangle 'em with my bare hands, as his life leave I can see it
No sympathy for your love once I wanna see 'em cry
The only thing I want to see more than that, is you die
I never said I was god but I can be the devil
I hate you with a passion and that's on every level
If I hear some (?)
I kiss the cross on my rosary then I squeeze the metal

[Verse 4: Lil Wyte]
Kiss yo ass goodbye, take the safety off the 4-5
A shovel and duct tape are sittin' in the trunk of my ride
No discussion, just rush 'em, we've already had our conversation
Plus I got goons in every crack and crevice in this nation
One phone call is all it takes, couple of stacks up out the bank
You be missin' and I be chillin' in Texas, sippin' purple drank
The president ain't gotta lift a finger but if I did I'd only bust 'em
And I ain't about to fight you pussy motherfuckers
I just tell my soldiers:

[Hook: Partee]
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em
Rush em, rush em, rush em, rush em
No time for discussion
When you see em rush em

Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin'  shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
Invite you over bitch
Whoop your ass for talkin' shit
