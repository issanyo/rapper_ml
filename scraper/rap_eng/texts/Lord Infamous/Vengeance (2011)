[Hook] 2x
My vengeance it's a dish that's best served ice-cold
Got a carbine with the tips I'll unload in your torso
And you will be expired, D.O.A, tagged toe
And they can't view the mutilated body, casket closed

[Verse 1]
BLAY!
Infamous I am the heartless assistent
Relentless when I'm cuttin' dope in the trenches
Send them lil buddies, whatever you venting
Smith & Wesson keeping me ignorant
Trippin' sniffin' wiffin' drippin'
Scoop out the pack out the bag and then lift it
Give me the track and watch Infamous rip it
Pumpin the gauge and the blastin' is grippin'
Tylenol gray lac and I got the paint drippin'
Niggas is trippin' they bitch my whippin'
Puttin' the flame and Ill light in a instance
Come against me and I beat you to senses
Crucial condiction there is no repentin'
Exterminate every trick, the art of mystic
Percocet keepin' the Infamous itchin'
You come with them killas, got Infamous trippin'
You about to catch you a fillin'
Brains drippin' up off the ceilin'
Bodies layin' all over the buildin'
Will you survive by one in a trillion
Will it stop, I just keep peelin'
Villain, drillin', meter millin'
Trip and watch yo head get shifted
Get anywhere ignorant, I am so gifted

[Hook] 2x
My vengeance it's a dish that's best served ice-cold
Got a carbine with the tips I'll unload in your torso
And you will be expired, D.O.A, tagged toe
And they can't view the mutilated body, casket closed

[Verse 2]
This chrome megatron go and blow out both yo fuckin' lungs
When I'm full of peruvian num no sympathy, it's redrum
Now or never, death and that's forever want a war with devils
And I'm very clever, you ain't on my level, you a pebble
I'mma grab the shovel, drop yo ass up on that 6 foot level
Lord demonic rebel, I may never reach my highest level
Hope there's no reward or I get close to reach your soul
Yes vengeance is a dish that's best served ice cold
