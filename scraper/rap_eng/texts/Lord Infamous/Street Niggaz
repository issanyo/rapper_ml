[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Street nigga, been a hitter, get up with you real quick
Hater's always talkin' shit until I pull up with that Mac
Put that gun to yo head, now I got you bitches scared
Lay it down right now while I rob you for yo bread
Street nigga, been a hitter, get up with you real quick
Hater's always talkin' shit until I pull up with that Mac
Put that gun to yo head, now I got you bitches scared

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
Is it the hoes I be fuckin', is it the money we flex?
Make haters wanna dethrone me but they ain't conquered me yet
Foot on the neck of my enemy, you be under me next
They question if I am lyrically an anomaly - yes!
I'm ready to rob niggas if I got a sucker (?) finna meet that chopper
I'm (?) enemies by their colours ... hit them with the lava
Murderous tendencies runnin' through a nigga, (?) make me wanna do a slaughter
Hideous energies I release and lay a nigga down, smack 'em with the yappa
Look, you are not a killa, you a jobber nigga
How the fuck them suckers gonna rob the robber nigga?
Times is hard, now they make a murderer harder nigga
I'm a 211-veteran, highly sharp gorilla

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Follow me into my wicked maze, get skinned alive and set on blaze
Hanibal the cannibal, human flesh has an acquired taste
Damn I'm crazed and you be amazed how many Lord has slayed
Bore, fried, baked, flambated then I lick the plate
Grind down teeth and then I feed ya to the wild boars
When I'm runnin out of bodies then I rob corpses from the morgue
Biological weapon, deadly as nuclear war heads
Better take up on yo bed cause you won't make it to the med
(?) they find pieces all over the house
With yo ass bleedin' out then I make some fuckin' nigga sauce
Throw your head like Joe Montana when I'm full of Tony Montana
Fuck a goddamn stockin', niggas heads hangin' from my (?)

[Verse 3: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Robbin' and mobbin', Skinny stay scr-izz-apped with that K
Gimi Sum before I put some holes in yo face
Get on the floor and tell yo bitch to take me to the safe
Drop off the pounds bitch nigga, drop off them K's bitch nigga
Gloves on my fuckin' hands, ski mask on my skull
Where the keys to da whip? Twenty G's in the (?)
Yellow in the refrigerator, jewelry in the dresser
"His pockets broke as hell, Pimp" - shoot that motherfucker
Robbers, we hang in the North Memphis area
Throw his bloody body in a old ass Chevy truck
Nigga should have known that I'm skinny but I'm dangerous
Clicked up with the Manson Family, bitch it's Heltah Skeltah
