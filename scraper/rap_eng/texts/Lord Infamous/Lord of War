[Hook] 2x
Blood pools formin' on the floor
They call me Scarecrow, you can call me Lord of War
Death shall be your fate if you wish to stop my madness
Want to blow up every motherfucker on the planet

[Verse: Lord Infamous]
An opponent, can't condone it
I de-bone him on the mystic microphone, it's
Lord the king you can't dethrone this
Trick I master horrorcore, yes I motherfuckin' own it
Catch a body, hit your bitch up for a motherfucking bonus
Bloody tendence from the muddy Mississippi
Goes to the damn pacific waters, great white shark
Looking for the slaughter, livin' marred up
Knock yo teeth off out the motherfucking tartar
Get some motherfucking (?) think you harder
Lord the party king on mollies and amphetamines
Yo body leakin' heavily
No more locked doors, cannot catch another felony
Drug abuser devily, demons are even scared of me
Satan been avoidin' me, been scopin' out his residence
He fear Illuminati, come and play in the Black Rain
Crow is soaring past the milky way on the dark range
Watchin' time run down for the whole human race
Civilian mass murder from the new nuclear base
Soze Rowdy body snatcher wearin' faces from the massacre
Natural disaster, make a quick tsunami with slapping ya
Sniff a avalanche so guess I'm very highly tolerant
A drop of blood enough to OD twenty fuckin' walruses
The politics involvin' this damn psychopathic novelist
Find the bodies hangin' in some motherfucking cottages
Slicin' off the testicles of victims with a sickle
Master I'ma cock two to the temple's very simple

[Hook] 2x
Blood pools formin' on the floor
They call me Scarecrow, you can call me Lord of War
Death shall be your fate if you wish to stop my madness
Want to blow up every motherfucker on the planet
