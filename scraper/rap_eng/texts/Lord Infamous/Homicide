Yeah, Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
I smack yo mammy in the head with a hatchet hoe

[Hook: Frayser Boy & Lord Infamous]
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
You can see the Devil Shyt when you look in my eyes
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
Snort a line, split you from your neck to your spine
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
I'mma take you on that long motherfuckin ride
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
I'mma fuck around and take your motherfuckin life

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Plasma spill, Navy SEAL, serial kill skill
Bitch it's Lord from Amityville, mass murderer with sexappeal
Milli ill, leave your ass in rigor mortis
Circled by the roaches, maggots decomposin'
Dead as a motherfucker, nerves still jerkin'
Nigga am I tweakin' or this bitch look like he twerkin'
Body everybody from the center to peripheral
I'mma keep it minimal, bloody and real physical
Hydra-Shoks blast, heatin' like a fuckin lava mag
Inside bakin', feelin' death awaitin'
Inside inferno, feelin' like you got cremated
Fill 'em with formaldehyde, flesh is still shakin'
Evil, malicious, devilish, vicious
There's no description, call the mortician
Triple 6 psychosis, visions are ferocious
Come and take a visit into Crows hypnosis

[Hook: Frayser Boy & Lord Infamous]
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
You can see the Devil Shyt when you look in my eyes
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
Snort a line, split you from your neck to your spine
Homicide, nigga, all I see is Homicide
I'mma take you on that long motherfuckin ride

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Lyrical heroin syringes, back with bad intentions
Bitch I've done decision, I'm about to bend ya
Make some deep incisions, Triple 6 ninja
Dark night avenger, thirty I'll send ya
When this mag pinch ya, break down your dimension
Place you like a picture, layin' there disfigured
Black-blooded negro, fuckin' black weirdo
Nigga I'm not jokin', snatch your jugular out yo throat
Spill your damn chitlins, layin' on da sidewalk
Something dumb provoke me
Got you garglin', snortin' blood clots
Hellgates open, slaughter in slow motion
Lord the locomotive, keep that barrel smokin'
Crow is full of potion, coke and purple lotion
I'mma super soak him, bag him up and tote him
Throw him in the river, where he shake and shiver
Muddy Mississippi nigga, won't nobody miss ya
