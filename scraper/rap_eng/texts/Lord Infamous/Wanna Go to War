[Intro:]
-Wassup Paul mane?
~Shit
-Man you know every time I see that nigga mane
That nigga be talkin' 'bout fuck Triple Six and shit man
You know whats wrong with that bitch
That bitch got anna? Or somethin?
~I can tell a bitch got anna
If he did take care of his business like a real nigga
This for all ya'll hoes

[Hook] 4x
And if you motherfuckers wanna go to war
Punk motha- punk motherfucker what you waitin' for?

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
There's always a nigga in back of the club
Actin' like lil' bitches callin' names
Talkin all of that shit all damn night in the club
But them bitches did not do a thang
Talk all of that yak if you want to but boy
You best back all the anna away
Cause Triple Six ready for violence nigga
Triple Six ready for bustin' shells
Ain't no use in you showin' out, damn fool
Cause you will just get your damn fuckin' head split
Now sit yo lil' monkey ass down
Cause don't nobody want your damn bitch or your shit
Now boy your ass better think twice
Before you decide to play with mafia boys
Cause when you wish to play with mafia boys
You best bring you some dangerous toys
Don't make me pull out the (?)
And fuck up the dance club with your hoe-nigga blood
Scarecrow will unload and go loco
And smoke every joke that approach in this club
Now I came to rap and get paid
I did not come to spray up somebodys damn child
But it always gotta be some niggas
That wanna get too wild
Now niggas can't just have some fun
They wanna fight, they wanna gun, for some
Thats the only reason that they come
But niggas like that are the ones Lord Infamous ready for
Just listen to the breakdown for the ones who just ignore

[Hook] 4x
And if you motherfuckers wanna go to war
Punk motha- punk motherfucker what you waitin' for?

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
I can't tell that bitch want some of me
The Triple Six don't ride shotgun, we ride Uzi
Plastic Glock, Ruger, Nine and the Cali
With the hundred round clip in the alley
Of your hood nigga, you see me every day
Never make a move and never wanna play
With the gangsta ass chucky-style
Devil so mean bullshit to the side
Don't come solo, bring ya whole team
Hoe to the circle if there's any real nigga
In any one of ya'll hoes
Don't try to have we kickin' down them doors
The Black Haven zone is where you'll find me bitch
So no excuses when I  wreck up your click
With the click on my Triple Six weapon hoe
So quit talkin that shit to your rhod√©s 'fore I test ya hoe
And my only side kick that was name is  54
So now ya know whatt the fuck you waitin' for

[Hook] 8x
And if you motherfuckers wanna go to war
Punk motha- punk motherfucker what you waitin' for?
