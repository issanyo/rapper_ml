[Intro: Locodunit]
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Lord
And the Word was Lord
The same was in the beginning with Lord
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made
In him was life; and the life was light of Seed of 6ix
It's goin' down... rest in peace Lord Infamous!
The motherfucking (?) the Infamous beast bitch
Seed of 6ix in this hoe, Faces of Gospel nigga

[Hook: Locodunit]
The Glock on my w-izz-aist, still on that b-izz-ay
Hangin' on the corner, puffin' marijuana
We some Dunigans, we some Dunigans
Everything we did you just done again
Ski mask over my skull
Papers in my mouth cause I'm grill
Bitch it's a house call
Glock nine with no love, love, love

[Interlude: Lord Infamous]
Yeah motherfucker, this is Lord Infamous
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter, Scarecrow hoe
To my kinfolk: Loco
Yeah my blood kinfolk so don't fuck with him
Or we'll be at ya with ya, bitch

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
And then when I shred him I turn on the dread
When I leave him for dead, mozzarella the head
Dig up the spot so the body can rest
When you fuck with me, yes you fuckin' with the best
Murderous thoughts, tombs, plots
Throw 'em in hollow ground, fuck a pine box
.45 cal mag it hit like a ox
As the heat bubble skin like he got chicken pox
Time to play Camela, I will let hammer cock
And yo weak ass will get blown out your socks
Toss me the Glock and I rock it, it's tocks
And his corpse washed up on the fuckin' river rocks
Opportunity knocks when you got money knots
Picture the shit like you got Magnavox
Smith & Wesson impale you while your bitch watch
Yo death time is close on the clock - Tick Tock!

[Verse 2: Lil Infamous]
Yeah killas kill a nigga, don't flee the scene
I just stare at the body, I love the scenery
Pussy niggas talk shit, dead turn goes quick
Hood full of paranormal activities
But I bet this Ruger leave 'em wet like neopren
(?) spotlight, light 'em up with the infrabeam
Hit the gas, drop the ash, car pass like Nas
Drive-by, put a slug in his memories
All these niggas suffer in the motherfucking gully
Dead bodies smell strong like motherfucking garlic
I'm a demon, hope you got some motherfucking garlic
Decorate his body, have that motherfucking garnish
Operation killa gorillas up in the back with the silver
My niggas are civil combat with the milli gats
Like I said, drive-by with the cam ... motion picture
Pic his corpse to a necrophiliac

[Hook: Locodunit]
The Glock on my w-izz-aist, still on that b-izz-ay
Hangin' on the corner, puffin' marijuana
We some Dunigans, we some Dunigans
Everything we did you just done again
Ski mask over my skull
Papers in my mouth cause I'm grill
Bitch it's a house call
Glock nine with no love, love, love
Ski mask over my skull
Papers in my mouth cause I'm grill
Bitch it's a house call
Glock nine with no love, love, love
