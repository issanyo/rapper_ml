[Verse 2: Indo G]
I'mma hit it with a T.K.O, straight thug to the core
If you didn't know, nigga now ya know
I'm a bonafide S.L.A.B rider thrown
(?) 44 (?) break 'em down (?)
Got a sticky, got the purple, got the kush
Straight presidential shit, nigga George Bush
Tryin' to hold a dead bunch of 'caine like wine
Sip it and choke it, I bet yo ass gon' die
Ride, get high til the sun gon' rise
Higher than a motherfucker, see it in my eyes
See I be (?) I'mma never detox
I'mma pop plenty pills, stay dodgin' the cops
Mobbin' the block, coppin' the Glock non-stop
I'm a bad motherfucker, put the tick in the tock
Put the ying in the yang, I'm a king you a lame
Smokin' nothin' but the fire, this yo boy, yo highness


[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Imperial Lord, delivery solved, the cranium
I am the epitome of a notorious serial killer
I am the mystical king of your misery
Sociopathic, we spray automatics
The measures are drastic when Scarecrow attacking
The bloody ass package I wrap up in plastic
There's not enough of your corpse for a casket
Keyser Soze, I set souls on blaze
The nickel plated razor blade
My sector of Hades amazed
Demonicily crazed a wicked race
Come back with me to hell
I'm cannibalistic for blood and I want me a taste
Erasing the every damn trace of your waste
I bite off your face not enough for a case
