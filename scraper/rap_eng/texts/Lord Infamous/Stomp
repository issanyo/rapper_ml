[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]
Voices in them trees, these are the things
That help me vision these evil most things
Me and DJ Paul we got the hook up finna go stick
Me on the passenger side, loc took a slight peek
Through thy window, somethin' creepin' up slow
It was this Lotus driven by this hoe
So I'm sippin' on thy RÃ©my
Hoping it won't cross my rhodes attention
Not only was you in it yet another nigga drivin'
Paul stopped the car
Said: "want you buck 'em rough Koopsta?"
Shi'r't I know ya hurt, take them bi'r'ches back
Take 'em back with them slugs
Sad to see ya gone son, teflons in yo crest
Mr. Kutem and dread shed
Koopsta got em scared, want prophitin'
Shit see that watcha get fo talkin' shit
Trick I'll drop you in a splunder
Cut ya up like Jeffrey Dahmer biatch

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Come, come who the fuck, they want some
Niggas want to jump, jump, getcha make ya pump, pump
Scarecrow miss ya bump, bump off a nigga fakin'
Goin' to a region, bitches tremblin', shakin'
Mafioso rule by and he will act a fool
We don't give a damn if you're fuckin' red or blue boy
Couldn't buy the wet slide, goin' on this bassline
Lord Infamous don't waste time when me gotta get mine
You know what I want but do Koopsta gets it
Storm on this bitch like some new years confetti
Astronomical Triple 6 writes space on top of asteroids
Comin' to rip up the shore
We killin' the fool, so act a fool boy

[Hook]
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
How long ago deep in the North
Where niggas stay drunk and smoke Newports
From ??? street with all my peeps
I used to scratch and program beats
I made a mix with real deep bass
At Northside high be slangin' tapes
DJ in this shit tryin' to make it and shit
Tone they speakers and stack they crates
Studio gig was the place to be
Where all jocks were tryin' to get
The chance get on the tables and spin
A fool kept tryin' i could quit
The club was packed from wall to wall
The gangsta walk is what we called
When niggas got buck in a circle and danced
And dared a fool, to slip and fall
We tore up the club and showed no love
Just throw in our face and gettin real buck
They might wanna fight later on the night
Cause Memphis playas don't give a fuck
Security jumped we smack the punks
For throwin' us out for smokin' a blunt
The number one song, had just came on
And now it's time to fuckin' stomp

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Juicy's in the motherfuckin' house, fins'to peel yo
Motherfuckin' skin back, it's they fuckin' steelo
On your fuckin' ass, we can't brag
Cause we comin' up, robbers on my ass
Should I blast cause they runnin' up
Maybe it's my friend, but then them friends will turn too yo
With the sig sauer 9, boy I come to kick doors
I stick those bitches in my trunk and now we back to my hood
The one on the left ain't die yet but he wishin' he would
Wasn't in the mood for this buck shit
But these niggas had to creep and boy they stupid
I sit, I leave these hoes for a permanent sleep
And now we out to the club we gotta get em' up
Triple 6 and Prophet Posse, ya'll know we make em' stomp

[Hook]
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
Stomp motherfucker, stomp motherfucker, stomp
(lay at, move his ass down to the concrete)
