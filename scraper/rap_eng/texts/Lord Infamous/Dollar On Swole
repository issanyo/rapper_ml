[Hook]
In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out

In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out

[Verse 1]
Kamikaze in the Maserati, homicidal hobbies
Blow your bodies up like Nagasaki, missiles from the shotty
Split your body then I mold the corpses out on a big dolly
Go for (?) the party, poppin' molly, scopin' cholly
There's no need for an autopsy when this migo gettin' naughty
Flesh is rottin', never stoppin', medulla oblongata
Spreadin' parts of your whole nogging, bring a keep up for a goon
For a motherfuckin' bargain on, embedded your horror
Cyanide, sayonara, Guatemala, pounds trapped
In the snout of a wicked clone, Saigon, Heroin
My flow is in the medicine, my tolerance is nuclear
With the skull and crossbones, hold on my soul
It's gone zoned out for so long, I'mma blown like a trombone
Shittin' on you maricones, throwin' your hood
(?) don't even do that, I rip and rob you wussies
Throw them bitch niggas a Tampax, hairpin trigger
And (?)

[Hook]
In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out

In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out

[Verse 2]
Mad Max, thunderdome, crystal
Huffin' on broke glass, grippin' on pistols
Hitman mercenary blackout squad man
I'mma blow your motherfuckin' back out, Afghan
Bounty hunter, doomsday, motherfuckin' assassin
Kick in the entrance then commence the blastin'
Lord Voorhees, Scarecrow Myers
Do some wicked shit, with a torch 'n pliers
Opiates, benzos and amphetamines
Tussionex, roxies, promethazine, codeine
Kush bud smoke 'bout to strangle
No breath internally, I think I'm 'bout to bleed to death
Think all my brain cells obliterated
Alzheimer settin' in and I'm really age-old
Lord Infamous, my flesh is tortured by an addiction
Most of my life I see these demonic visions

[Hook] 2x
In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out

In the middle of the club, dollar on swole
Take me a scoop, put it to my nose
Buckin' through the crowd, knock yo bitch down
Pistol in my draws, don't make me pull it out
