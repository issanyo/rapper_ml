[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
The battlefield is stained with blood
Blood flowin' out the dead and the wounded guts
The grass is soaking with
The dirt is turned to reddish mud
Smoke is comin' out the wounds and bodies burnin' up
It's War Love!

[Verse 1: II Tone]
Damn I can't think
When my mind is on another level
Situation critical
I keep that heavy metal, cuz
Everytime I see yo face
My evil side be clickin' in
Buckin', blastin', come out laughin'
No remorse, I'm goin' in

I don't understand my nigga
I never was yo friend (your friend)
All these years done pass my nigga
And now it's time to meet yo end (your end)

Cause I'm runnin', gunnin' for the money
Who else said this shit was funny?
Walk up on you slow
And put that hot shit in yo tummy
See my dreams are kinda strange
When I'm fulla cocaine
Still down with my click
And we reppin' Black Rain
I did scope yo pregnant wife
And I hold that hoe ass hostage
If the money ain't right
Then I leave her like a sausage
Grab the hoe by the neck
Go cash for check
All my goons got my back
With the choppers on deck
Run up in yo momma house
Put that gun up in her mouth
Let her know what about shit (?)

[Verse 2: Koopsta Knicca]
... y'all niggas
It's a everyday job not to kill y'all niggas
Y'all hatin' on this bitch just to come up
Y'all thought: "Lord and Koop, this is fucked up"
It's best to just to lay low nigga
We buck like that, shoot up the radio niggas
Remember black fingernails, dressed in black
Upside down cross, but no hoe do your pedicure
Chucky doll painted on the trunk of the truck
Got (?) in hell like we from vietnam
Lick my nuts, suck my dick, (?) chick
My guys ran a train on that bitch
They smile in my face
But these niggas don't like me
They wanna get just like me
But they don't wanna fight me
Like me, I brought the first plaque to the scene
Motherfuckers hate me, welcome back
Know I mean?

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I keep a bag of limes so when I put this nine on niggas minds
I can't help it, when I write my rhymes I think by niggas dyin'
Rippin' out a spine and hittin' lines to occupy my time
In my laboratory: Frankenstein, Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
I'm no bodybuilder but I'm always tryin' to pump some iron
I rap in my spare time
But ain't shit could get in heinous crimes
Bitch you best not cross the line
I peel the skin up off yo flesh
Chillin' at the coroner, he teachin' me how to dissect
Hit you with the syringe, watch you goin' cardiac arrest
If I liked you when I fought you off I would not leave a mess
More or less, don't test my patience
Or the hammer hit the pin
Do you in and watch it on the news
With yo ol' mammy then
Rip out teeth and cut off fingers
Burn him, can't identify
Bag him, drag him, tag the fag
And rest in place to petrify
Is this title petrified
I wanna see your insides
Watch that goddamn blood
Wipe your feet when you come inside
