[Verse: DJ Paul & Lord Infamous]
The devil is comin' and as the world turn
All you niggas stay cross, the killas are gonna burn

Here comes the Infamous, the satanic lyrical merchant
Speakin' with the tongue of the serpent
Step into my world of terrorism
Pure horror, fuck the earth exorcism
The gatekeeper walk up to the eternal flame
Remember the evil grin as I present infinite pain

Here comes the undertaker, the master of mutilation

(?) revelation
Splittin' and snatchin' a son of a bitches eyes up out the socket

Stompin' and poppin' and droppin' 'em when I load up the cartridge

I can never ever, never ever spare a fuckin' hostage

And all fools gettin' bucked across the target

When the buckshots pour, blood spills to the floor

Till ya knock, knock, knock on heavens motherfuckin' door

[Samples]
(?) for yo life when my shotgun scatter
(?) point blank range (?)
Motherfuckers (?) me, they must be crazy
