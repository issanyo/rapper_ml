[Lord Infamous]
Don't get smacked in the face with a Louisville slugger
Crack yo whole cranium into fragments like a puzzle
On this cocaine hustle, rabid dog need a muzzle
Do you in and throw your fuckin' raw carcass to the buzzards
Cut yo tongue out yo mouth, have ya t-a-talk and stutter
Drag you bitches to the river, get you muddy muthafucker
Lord loc on this opiates and coke, don't provoke
Take a toke and blast a (?)-size hole in yo throat
Then I bury these niggas in back of the villa
PCP and painkillers, put yo brains in da blender
Mystic styles of the ancient mutilations
Cross my path, there's gonna be some complications, yeah

Lord Infamous, Scarecrow, Rowdy Bounty Hunter
Mafia, let's go, let's go
