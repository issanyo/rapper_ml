[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Everybody get yo mask, tryin' to find that stash
Creepin' on that ass, I just want the cash
I heard you talkin' bad, like you tryin' to brag
Bullets start sprayin', ain't nobody playin'
We burnin' off in the Jag, ridin' deep with them sweepers
Left you lookin' stupid, pussy ass lemon saw the reaper
Jump like Evel Knievel when that chopper hit yo chest
Suckers can't confess, poltergeist on you tricks
Yo life lookin' blurry, my bag lookin' chubby
I stab yo ass like Chucky with that K barrel bloody
Bloody muddy, suddenly take yo ass to the Gimi Sum hideout
Take yo shoes off of my backseat, gun in ya mouth

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
Hitman, murderer, bustin' out the Fleetwood
Nigga's devilish and had to die, that's why I sleep good
Run up on a G and make my day, I think I'm Eastwood
Tear yo head off in a fit of rage, the way a beast would
(?) word of bible's tellin' me to meek (?)
When they run they kingdom of the world and finally eat good
That's the reason I can't stand a bully, I keep a fully
To fill up they bodies with bullets, you thought I wouldn't
My uncle's Tommy, I don't ride or die to be a man first
And if you gon' ride or die do it for fam first
Step into this mass, you gon' see what's in my hand
(?) and be another victim off in the back of a damn hearse

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
May I interest you in a .500 cal. revolver slug?
Bust you in your mug, spill everything you thinkin' of
Don't be actin' all nervous and scared around me bitch
I crank this chainsaw blade and give your ass a dental fix
We represent the hundred shot-kill
I put a bullet everywhere except in your damn heel
Chill, put the dollar down, they 'bout to come outside
I won't be satisfied till they filled with formaldehyde
Got the Tommy gun, .45's, .50 drum
I hit you in the liver, make you shiver and go numb
Infamous I come from the land down under
Vomit up your stomach, leave your body in the tundra
