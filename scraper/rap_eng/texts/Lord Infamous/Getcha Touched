You fucked up bitch, yeah I can Getcha Touched
Have a black ops squad bring yo blood in a cup
Pussies like you join a gang for backup
ABK play tough, blow yo back out lil bra

You fucked up bitch, yeah I can Getcha Touched
Have a black ops squad bring yo blood in a cup
Pussies like you join a gang for backup
ABK play tough, retaliation is a must

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
You know what it is when I came through da door
I know you can't wait till I get on da floor
So pull up the Skinny Pimp (?) on my back
You know that I'm real cause I'm mackin' on hoes
I'm 'bout to go pop me a bottle of cristal

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Infamous eatin' this (?) heavenly
Theres no rapper that ever compare with me
Niggas they wanna get shot apparently
Chopping yo weak ass up like you some celery
There's nobody that measure can measure me
Yo wussy ass be needin' some therapy
Infamous comes so hard, it's scaring me
Only damn thing you will see is the trigger squeeze
Wrap up the body and dump in the trunk
We bury ya deep so they can't smell the funk
Carbine fifteen ...
Yo pussy ass body that's scattered in chunks
They won't find ya rottin' ass body for months
You should stop touching me you fuck with me punk
In the morgue you filled formaldehyde
Or in da med with a shitbag, you paralysed
Scarecrow the master of homicide
My trigger finger be gettin' some exercise
You sucka-ass nigga be talkin' that shit
When I see you on the streets you be petrified
Niggas come get you a dose of the massacre ghost
I will leave your smoke ass comatose
If you ever come close I will hit you
With shit that disintegrate yo ass to ash (?) hoe
When I'm full of that coke, oh my god that's a no-no
Cause Lord can get real extra, anyone of yo click
I promise no shit can save you from that stretcher
You bustin' your pipes from the pressure
Run real fast the bullet that catch ya
Retaliation is a must, your death is nothin' lesser
