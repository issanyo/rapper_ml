[Intro] 2x
I don't get sick of digging ditches
And I never get tired of disposal of you bitches
I will tag and bag me a fag with the quickness
The last thing you see is my eyes, God my witness

[Verse]
Send them in shock when I hit six shots
And the sockin' will make your whole body rock
Terrorize niggas eliminate them by tha flock
These hoes they goin' in shock
Slob on my knob with the .40 cal Glock
Burn like a motherfucker when it pop
Peelin' your fuckin' top
Leave your fucky ass body somewhere to rot
Drain your main veins
The colour change when you're empty mane
Leave you layin' on a range
No brain just flesh is hangin' strange
Stab you in the eye with a damn fork
You dorks get torched, it's bloodsport on my court
Cut your damn corpse, smoke a Newport
Hell of fire, 6th Enterprise you
I despise you, set on fire
Call all your gangstas Carbine 1-5
Cut you by waistside
Pain, I deliver, make you shiver
Spill your fuckin' liver
Drill ya, spill ya, kill ya, nigga
