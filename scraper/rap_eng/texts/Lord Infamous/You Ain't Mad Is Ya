Make a move, make a move
Jump like you - jump like you - jump like you want some

[DJ Paul]
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Niggas that try to cross us, those the ones we shoot up
Blowin' the suckers guts out with the nina Luger or the Ruger
Ammo threw up niggas heads they blew up
Scarecrow is schemin' to take all you bustas to graveyard
Time for the crew cut
You for didn't know what happen once we threw the Tooter
'Cause when I got gauges I get too buck
Crucify a nigga frontin' like you do us
You do what when I roll up yo remember to duck
And to the niggas who want trouble in the future
Don't fuck with Scarecrow, cause Scarecrow will shoot ya
Fuck yeah, dead in yo motherfuckin' bladder
Gunnin' down a busta, to Scarecrow it just don't matter
Spaced up in the mind, especially when we get the pure
Nina milli slizzug in yo spine raise body temperature
I know that you know
I know you can't fuck with the Infamous bitch
Slow-ass nigga, you ain't mad is ya, trick?

[Bridge: DJ Paul talking]
Yeah the new DJ Paul and Lord Infamous "Come with me to Hell"
The new Serial Killaz tape on yo motherfuckin' ass! Finna take ya deeper than 6 feet... And I hope you ain't fucked up about it, nigga!!!!!!!!

[DJ Paul]
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya, bitch?

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
You ain't bulletproof, bitch
So watch the .45 Glock sp-izz-it in yo face
And watch yo motherfuckin' murder take place
Place me a nigga in my graveyard
My backyard is my graveyard for bustas that wanna be hard
The hoe caught up poor with the motherfuckin' Wesson
These HKs guarantizzle... for a fizzool
And why all these bitches mamas and aunties comin' in my face
Askin' me why I diss their little bitch on our mixtape?
Lyin' and shit to ya friends that we used to be together, ho
But you only sucked my dick in Limbo
And if I hurt yo feelings, it's too bad!
Hahaha, you ain't mad!?

[DJ Paul]
You ain't mad is ya?
You ain't mad is ya, trick?
