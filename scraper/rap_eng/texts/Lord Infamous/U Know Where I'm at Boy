I'm om South Memphis cause I am the king of SPV
I'm on South Memphis, ask them niggas down on Victor Street
I'm on South Memphis, just like ellas and a sofa plate
I'm on South Memphis like a razor and a saucer tray
I'm on South Memphis like some junkies at a carwash

I'm on South Memphis, always killin up at night and day
I'm on South Memphis cause I always got a bag of bay
I'm on South Memphis at the club going to Funkytown
That's when you got the pinky finger and your thumb stuck out

I'm more North Memphis that a V-curl that ain't done
I'm more North Memphis than a car thief on the run
I'm more North Memphis than some dog food up my nose
I'm more North Memphis in the hood scoopin junkie hoes
I'm more North Memphis, house full of hoes fixin hair
While I'm in the back selling crack, weed in the air
I'm more North Memphis then the store called Metro Market
I'm in that motherfucker, stealing, money in my pockets
I'm so North Memphis, just like dope fiends after dark
Buck wild as hell , like the short end of Hyde Park
I'm more North Memphis than a drug deal going bad
The dope ain't jumpin back, right dog you been had
I'm more North Memphis, in the hood club startin shit
I'm more North Memphis while in mall whoopin on a bitch
I'm more North Memphis dice all night on the porch
Drinkin on Pauley Mooson, we ain't do the torch
