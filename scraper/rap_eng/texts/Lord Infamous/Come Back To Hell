[Hook]
Overdosing on some potion not knowing all wasn't well
Burning flesh was the smell, come back with me to hell
The narcotics took my body and I lived to tell the tale
And I screamed out my prayers, come back with me to hell
It's a living nightmare, man I never been so scared
So prepare to come back with me to hell
I seen the other side and I died, I know it's very rare
Oh yeah, come back with me to hell

[Verse 1]
Imperial Lord, delivery solved, the cranium
I am the epitome of a notorious serial killer
I am the mystical king of your misery
Sociopathic, we spray automatics
The measures are drastic when Scarecrow attacking
The bloody ass package I wrap up in plastic
There's not enough of your corpse for a casket
Keyser Soze, I set souls on blaze
The nickel plated razor blade
My sector of Hades amazed
Demonicily crazed a wicked race
Come back with me to hell
I'm cannibalistic for blood and I want me a taste
Erasing the every damn trace of your waste
I bite off your face not enough for a case
Oh what a tangled web we weave
Black widow triple 6 degrees
Maniac from Mercury, from massacre university
Murder with diversity
You don't wanna see the worst of me
Ring around the hearses please
Bodies packed up in the freeze

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was dozing at the night house
Lights out, trying to get wiped out
No doubt, but I took the wrong route
In my haze, I'm over-wasted
I'm so baked I got cremated
Start feeling my life fading
Oh my God have I forsaken?
Awaken by demonic yells
My body has a metallic shell
And then the flames began to swell
Hoof prints in me everywhere
Rap many songs 'bout hell, yeah
But I didn't want to be down there
Praying "Lord please bring me back"
Torture Scarecrow to the max
Heard somebody yell "Clear!"
Shocked me back from cardiac
Paramedics with the paddles with the oxygen masks
History a blast, had a stroke, and my kidneys locked
Marked the dialysis, my right leg gone, man I'm shocked

[Hook]
