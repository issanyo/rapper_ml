[Intro]
Lord Infamous
Bloody Bloody Scarecrow!
What you gon' do with it?
You can't do shit about it!
Roll with it
Roll with it bitch!

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Local ass niggas be killin' me
Flaugin' like they nation wide, but these reachin' no sales
Even though I'm no longer Three 6
But you dissin' my brother will get you impaled
Faggot ass nigga be flashin' his ass on the stage
You know thats some faggot ass shit
Sayin' it take two arms to shoot machine guns
Got niggas that handle that bitch
Back to original topic
These hoes ain't no worth the Scarecrow as a fuckin' icone
Smashin' the head with the 46 struck to the dome
I promise you do no more wrong
BLAY! Pop a to your brain
And wipe your blood spray out my eye
Machete to decapitate
And took you somewhere they can't find
Lord is the entity ... infinity
Enemies will be diminished the (?)
(?) you faggots you (?) with maggots
The (?) ain't playin' games with you wussies
Lord is here to stay
And goin' no where like herpes bitch
... remember
I pay some G's for your goddamn murking
Shit

[Hook]
You don't want none (no!)
