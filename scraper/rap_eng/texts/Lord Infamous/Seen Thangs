[Chorus - 2X]
I done seen things that I wasn't supposed to see
I done been places know I wasn't supposed to be
Ya I know, that everyday is a constant grind
How could you ever tell the truth if you constantly lying

[Frayser Boy]
In the bay I was just another young nigga
Didn't know shit, hood full of fuckin drug dealers
Saw a lot of things
Some of my niggas dead some of my niggas still living
Out here gettin bread tyrina stay away from prison
I got my first gun when I turned sixteen
Cause in a bribe wasn't hard for me to get things
Cause its a lot of shit nobody never knew about
I let the past be the past so I threw it out
And ya I got robbed, and ya I got shot
Thats why I keep the .45 next to me cocked
Ill never slip again, I got artilery
A nigga havin good, no gettin rid of me
So fuck my enemies, theyll never know the half
Youll find yourself dead nigga all because my past
You couldn't survive in the places nigga we be
I miss my homie rest in peace my nigga Kiki

[Chorus - 2X]
I done seen things that I wasn't supposed to see
I done been places know I wasn't supposed to be
Ya I know, that everyday is a constant grind
How could you ever tell the truth if you constantly lying

[Lord Infamous]
I should never leave my head where I do my dirt
I will never use the same product that I work
I will always check to see whats up under your shirt
Keep a pistol at all times and I will disperse
Check that niggas pocket, check that hoes purse
Cause doin' twenty years (?) gonna get yo feelings hurt
And I never would believe in the word "friends"
All I believe is the power and the dividends
Get a business to clean up this traffic
They askin' how you get this shit, I'm payin' taxes
And I keep at least three fine attorneys
Cause I dont know when these folks will try to burn me
Dont let your left hand know what your right is doing
Dont let that bitch know shit, fuck some damn chewin'
All I pray is "god stop me 'fore they catch me"
But the pot still boilin' come and fetch me

[Chorus - 2X]
I done seen things that I wasn't supposed to see
I done been places know I wasn't supposed to be
Ya I know, that everyday is a constant grind
How could you ever tell the truth if you constantly lying

[Frayser Boy]
We had rain, but we also had some sunny days
Stay away from niggas that was shiesty with them funny ways
I peeped game kinda young when I was under age
So now im older I can never put my guns away
It still was hard even after it was money made
My momma got it had to split it up a hundred ways
Now thats some shit you had to witness if you from the bay
See momma strugglin cause they got her workin underpaid
A nigga tryed to hold it down when it got hard
Them niggas dropped me out of school thats how I got hard
My hoods cool in the day but when it got dark
You werent from around us its manditory that you got robbed
You niggas acting like you know what Ive been through
I went to jail for some shit that I got into
I did some things that I regret, I never ment to
But when youre young troubles easy to get into

[Chorus - 2X]
I done seen things that I wasn't supposed to see
I done been places know I wasn't supposed to be
Ya I know, that everyday is a constant grind
How could you ever tell the truth if you constantly lying
