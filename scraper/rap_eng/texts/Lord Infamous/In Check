Put your boy in check cause he runnin' off with demise
Put your boy in check cause he runnin' off with demise
Put your boy in check cause he runnin' off with demise

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow rip jugular, heroin T smuggler
Enter the maze of the maniac puzzler
Murders, so far I think it's by the dozen-ah
Niggas that thought that I really crank governour
Rip a man, double up, watch the flesh bubble up
... crank and your ass better cover up
Silencer, muzzler, pop you like triple bucks
Bodies are sprayed when they clear all the smoke and dust
Erratic surge and the murders are urgin'
They call me Lord Infamous psychotic merchant
As your ass may know by now, don't give a damn about the person
Milli burstin', slugs dispersin', biggas screamin', bitches cursin'
Flirtin' with death is very certain, you end up 6 feet in the dirt and
Maniac social schizophrenic, better not panic
Death's an irreversible damage
You do not manage to get away, look at your legs
Stay away over there goddammit
Scarecrow tha Terrible, rowdy Rowdy Bounty Hunter, let ya loose From the noose, then I hunt you down bitch, that's the truth

[Verse 2: Dada]
But then I got the mind of a maniac, thoughts of a haitian
Any given situation we leavin' 'em shakin'
Renegade your (?) pushed to the verge
Of a lunatic, a lunatic want a conflict
And you tricks go down here first
The last first, fuck a plead's word
So we pat yo ass cause you talk to much
Got a whole squad of Glocks - they don't talk, they bust
And it's best to go get yourself some business
(?) till you feelin' (?) shit pepe
In the south we in the lead down here pepe
Scope a hater on tha block, full-time whippin'
You a fool if you choose to lose
Don't be a hater on the side, been on the truth
And to me I can't believe got yo mug on me
Got the tools in the shed just to slice that beef
On point, all you haters stunt, tell whats right
On the block gettin' paid at day and night
It's the reason why you hate but I'mma get you some more
Then I ride low key then I stay ten toes
Where are no (?) you throw the first (?) out of my hand
Got that on another level, pass you out to my fan
That you talk shit, talk this, we come with the land
Got you trapped up in the maze with the world in my hand

And what I live for, oh hatin' ass hoe stop hatin' on me hoe
See Youngin make moves and Youngin break too
You don't really want to beef, I tell your friends are some fools
