[Verse 7: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Never will one of you niggas compete with the Infamous beast , I was taming these streets
Yes I'm a beast, I eat up these beats, I beat up these freaks, I torture to bleed
Placin' the ink pen up under the (?) C4 put into an enemy
Bloody the sheets, takin' my time with the cruel mutilation, the injuring
I launched him, punched him, pulverized him, brain damage his psyche
(?) makin' a nigga (?) his fuckin' Nikes
Summon, searchin', lurkin', brain is burstin', close yo curtains
Yes I'm very certain 'bout my packa-packa murkin'
