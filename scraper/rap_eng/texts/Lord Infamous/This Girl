[Intro]
Lord Infamous, Scarecrow
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
Yeah Scarecrow and Lil Sko motherfucker
I just rock out with [?] ho songs
But in 6th Enterprise bitch
We don't do a ho song
I'mma do it my way
Like this bitch

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Damn something 'bout this girl
I can't do shit but thinking 'bout this girl
I don't make a move man whitout this girl
She ain't the average bitch man no doubt this girl

[Verse 1: Lil Sko]
When I first met her it was love at first sight
Edible booty that type of apple that you'd love to bite
But your personality it kept my mind of lustin'
You showed me you were just fine and you like to wanted to have some
You showed all the right things that turn a nigga on
You say life is too short for games and little boys they need to push on
But it was easy for you to see that I'm a grown man
But I'm so stuck in my ways it's going to be hard for me to change
Say you want a man with responsibility
And I'mma make it happen to the best of my ability
And all I ask of you is just keep it one-hundred with me
I'm feelin' myself right now so tell me are you feelin' me
I always had a vision and it always included
There's no we without me and you if you ain't in it
You need to be there with me to the finish
With them strugglin' strive, tryin' to survive
Bonny and Clyde, jump in the ride, ride or die

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Damn something 'bout this girl
I can't do shit but thinking 'bout this girl
I don't make a move man whitout this girl
She ain't the average bitch man no doubt this girl

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
[?] Big hips, chest thick as a amazon
Not soft, bitch boss, skin kinda dark brown
Vicious with the fuck pussy grippin' like a glove
Almost made me fall in love, so I had to back up
Attitude rude, get money like a dude
When I first saw her nude, damn near spit all over my food
When I see your phone call I pick it up fast
What the fuck is wrong with me? Don't act like that over no ass
But my nigga say he feel me she's fine and rupty
When I'm fucked up she is the first one that come rub me
The only broad that I will listen to advice
And everytime I look up she is in my fucking sights
Goddamn what the fuck, do you know voodoo?
You pop up everytime I think about you
I don't know what the hell it is
Cause I haven't fell in love in fuckin' years

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Damn something 'bout this girl
I can't do shit but thinking 'bout this girl
I don't make a move man whitout this girl
She ain't the average bitch man no doubt this girl
