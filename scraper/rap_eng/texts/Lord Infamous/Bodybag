Ki-ki-ki ma-ma-ma

[Hook] 2x
I am the Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
I come from the land down under
You cross a killers path, that'll be your last
Get your maggot ass dumped into a bodybag

[Verse 1]
I promise you don't want no problems with Keyser
Evaporate bodies ...
... exercise
The rowdiest track with the 6th Enterprise
Death to all traitors, never cross Lord Vader
Smack potatoes with da lightsaber, milli mind raider, yeah
The black out make 'em tap out, blood is blastin' out your nostril
Trick don't come at me all hostile fore I make this fuckin' mac growl
Your lung is collapsin', you better ... out
Have you jumpin' up and down like a holy ghost up in you pal
Never smile, I never grin, I ain't cha friend
Bloody revenge is the situation you put in
So bitch don't come at me all funny with that okie-doke
You will get your hoe ass corpse steamed in fuckin' pistol smoke

[Hook]
I am the futuristic rowdy bounty hunter
I come from the land down under
You cross a killers path, that'll be your last
Get your maggot ass dumped into a bodybag

[Verse 2]
Hit you so hard with the tomahawk your fuckin' intestines collapse and you moonwalk
Hittin' a line of bolivian paint (?) with the salt
Sawed off blow yo (?) balls off, molotov cocktail burn 'em all
Break the law, peel yo skin off when goin' to the damn withdrawal
Sweatin' like a christmas hog, Soze, twisted serial killer
Tweakin' like a geeked up ninja, samurai slice ya, eat yo liver
Butchered to the goddamn gizzard, my (?) molly wizard
Snotty trigger, on that sizzurp, snortin' up a meth-blizzard
Take my turn here, bitch I run out at the rear
Nigga say he want a souvenir - I bring his fuckin' ear
Drag 'em to da river, him and his niggas 'gator dinner
Leave a suicide note to yo bitch and mammy in blood on the pillow

[Hook, until end]
I am the futuristic rowdy bounty hunter
I come from the land down under
You cross a killers path, that'll be your last
Get your maggot ass dumped into a bodybag
