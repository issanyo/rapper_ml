[Intro: Lord Infamous]
Lord Infamous, I now you niggas can't stand it
Cause all you motherfuckers thought he was out the game for good
Now you hoes got trouble

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
I'm kickin' ass, I'm takin' names, trick this ain't no stunt
Bitch, jump, jump, jump, jump, like you want some
This ain't Ashton Kutcher and you ain't gettin' punked
Bitch, jump, jump, jump, jump, like you want some
Have you bleedin' like a bitch at that time of the month
Bitch, jump, jump, jump, jump, like you want some
I see you over there muggin' with your nuts all pumped
Trick, jump, jump, jump, jump, like you want some

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Infamous blastin' this milli round like it's damn 007 on Hamburger Hill
Better watch out cause I'm blastin' this carbine till I see blood leakin' up out yo ear
Evil and dirty, damn son of a gun
And I got some shit, bet yo punk ass better run
Rip you in half like chainsaw Massacre, reach in yo chest and scatter yo lung
Come from the slums of Magnolia, South Memphis, South Park Way was the battlefield
When it comes to havin' remorse I don't know what that mean
All I feel from the kill is the thrill
Bitch I get ill, I torch yo ass and watch yo skin bubble
Can't get (?) shot like Micheal Jordan, I want a triple-double
12 gauge under yo chin, launch your head just like the space shuttle
(?) renegade rebel, calluses on hand from usin' that shovel
Just like Geto Boys, bitch I'm grippin' that on that other level
That other level, motherfucker, that other level
Into heavy metal but I ain't talkin' about no guitar chords
Talkin' I'm beatin' yo bloody ass body
And puttin' yo punk ass in the morgue
So get that boy, when the Scarecrow pick up the 12 gauge pump
Bitch jump, bitch jump like you want some
