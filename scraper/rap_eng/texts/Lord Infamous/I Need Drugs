[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
The Scarecrow got more issues
Than the Kleenex box got tissues
I got a pack of Thrax
(?) railroad tracks and launchin' missiles
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man
And I'm cookin' me a brick as fast as I can
Scandalous, I get sadistic in a fuckin' clutch
Red rust, hit the dust, lead thrust, skull duck
In the city with the milli
Crash yo (?) semi truck
You out of luck, I'm out the frame
Catchin' drains of pure cocaine
Insane in the membrane
Kush up to the flame
My vengeance is strategic
Sneak the scripts like an adhesive
I love beef, I'm not a vegan
(?) the fattest savage season
No treason is tolerated
Destroyin' a populated
(?), I'm volatile
Drug war, clear 'em out
Ounces, kilos, pounds
Causin' chaos, launch a hundred rounds
Balls and my word, Ernest, drug Lord crown

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
When I'm alone with my use
Sometimes I break down a ball
And in the back of my mind
I hear my conscious call
Tellin' me I need a brick
That ain't full of no cut
Cause the streets are fucked up
And I know I need drugs

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
When I woke up in the morning
With plenty thoughts in the brain
I wanna sip me a beer, blowin' a blunt of the Jane
I can't wait to take you out the sack and open the shells
Sprinkle yo body across it and put your love in the air
Now I'm caught in the mist, infatuated with bliss
I wrap my lips around the tip and give my baby a kiss
I know it's just another illusion, a trick on the mind
But when I'm high I feel like happiness will always be mine
Inhale and exhale, I'm in love with the taste
I ain't sharin' with niggas, I'm takin' bud to the face
Like I'm a J for chiefin' hay I cut to the chase
I take an ounce of kush
And smoke it down to nothin but shake
And there you have it, the habits of an addict
I need Mary Jane, I go ham if I don't have it
To put the icing on the cake: I'm also asthmatic
Chiefin' hard till I die, I'mma take me a stab at it
Damn I need drugs

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x

[Verse 3: II Tone]
There are drugs, gigglin' about The Game
Yeah he taught me how to flip it just don't call out his name
I'm a victim of society, veteran on my turf
Gun taught the kush smoker tryin' to get it what it's worth
Ain't no need for bed and money, I can get down with best
If you do it down my do a barrin' bitch cut me a check
While my sniffer sneakin' ain't no secret do it how ya do
We be higher than a motherfucker and ya lady too
Left the hood a little different started trappin' just to get it
Daddy workin' hard, he slangin' bricks, so I'm ready with it
See the brown bring ya down and the white keep ya hype
Call north west nigga I'm about to catch a fight
Yeah I'm 'bout it, don't ya doubt it like a fan should approve
When I fall up in the club I be higher than a fool
See my click them my niggas, we don't do the same thang
Cause they smokin' hella weed and I toot a little 'caine

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
