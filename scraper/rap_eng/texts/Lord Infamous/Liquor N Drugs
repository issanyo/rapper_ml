[Hook: DJ Paul] 8x
Fuckin' with that liquor and them drugs

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I say: twist it, hit it, light it, that's that burn that hay
In the bong kush come smokin' on that hay
I followed it up with yay
Most niggas can't do that play
Take a sip of Grand Marnier
My beats for the loop lay
Nigga I'm on that oldschool shit
Gettin' high, makin' that oldschol shit
Gettin' high, fucking me a oldschool bitch
That I met on the Mystic Stylez shit
Lighters in the air for Lord Infamous!
I said: lighters in the air for Lord Infamous!
Smoke one, bitch

[Verse 2: MJG]
This is how I spit it when I wanna spit it with the Hi-hat
I'm pimp tight MJG, I'mma make you wanna buy that
Download, CD, mixtape, MP3
Bitches up to stick up daily but that shit ain't temptin' me
... Break up for a bitch, I rather break a hoe
Make her go to distance
See that's how far I can really take her so
Tasteless hoe, never get smart at the mouth
I gotta back up bitch
Drank a yak, smoke a sack
Now it's time for you to back up bitch

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Went up to the liquor store
Got me a fifth of the Hennessy
Got some stouts just comin' up
I hope those bitches are ready to G
Pass Paul the blunt, he take three hits, he pass it back to me
Listening to a new track we just dropped
Coming through the A.M.P, got back to the crib
Opened the freezer and cracked the ice tray
Fillin on some glasses, the hoes just called, they on the way
Hey so we chiefin, hoes jump up, I started to pourin'
The Hennessy, the gift to see and this shit won't be borin'
Hoes will be whorin, niggas will be scorin'
Fuckin on the floors and deep sea explorin'
But anyway the sluts feel it and then they started to sip it
Twenty minutes later she on my dick, I started to dip it
Dogin coochies, workin hoochies
Makin them bitches do they duties
Soon as I got trough, kicked they ass out
Then I watched a movie
Now my ass is layed out on the rug
Toked up, fuckin wit that liquor and dat bud mane

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
(?) my (?) and go away
I prayed to god, my sins never went away
Koopsta Knicca, all niggas
Y'all niggas Triple Six members
(?) from the (?), check yo vest
Hoe you dare, it's like Crunchy said
I sleep with ammo, rolled kush dope
Blunts we smoke
And blow out a cloud of smoke

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
I smoke weed, I smoke bud, I fucked off with (?)
I fucked off with (?) molly, she's a freaky little slut
See I bent that bitch over and I fucked her in the butt
She licked on my nuts, yes she licked on my nuts
Full of all that Grand Marnier and I'm 'bout to bust a nut
All on that bitch face, cause I'm full of that drug
Fuckin' off with liquor and dat bud (what what?)
Fuckin' off with liquor and dat bud
