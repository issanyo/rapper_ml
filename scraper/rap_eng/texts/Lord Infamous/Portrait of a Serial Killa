[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Picture this; my mind is in a standstill
I'm dreamin' of bodies and evil thoughts because I wanna kill
Voices are speakin', they sayin' things that I never heard
But I'm understandin' and makin' sense of these foreign words
It's plain and simple a person's gonna die
When I awake in my sleep another innocent body cry
In night-time I dream evil thoughts of mutilated faces
Cut up body parts locked in suitcases
And then the dream becomes real, I don't understand
I awake in my sleep and findin' blood on my shakin' hands
I walk around as nervous as a dope fiend
And every time I see faces they were in my dreams
I thought I killed 'em before, but now I do it again
Cuttin' they heads from the body and pullin' flesh from within'
With every scream from a victim I'm growing stronger
When death finally come I hear the demons no longer
But then my mind is confused, I see a girl to pursue
The evil spirit's reborn and tellin' me what to do
So I begin the attack with my knife in her back
I see the fear in her eyes and then my body reacts
The darkness covers me, I'm put to rest
And I waitin', starin' down in my dark bloody chest
At first it was a dream but now I can feel
The nightmares become reality in the portrait of a serial killa

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Sittin' in my dark room sharpening the blades of my razors
As I sit in my rocking chair watchin' the sands of the hourglass
The night is almost gone, I cut my arm
And let the crimson trickle down my tongue
The rhymes of Lucifer
My visor low, time to make some more murders
But of course it's game time
Anticipating death 'cause I chew meat off the human
I take the head out the freezer then I let the blood soak all
Put the salt to the jaw 'cause I love my meat raw
I love the thrill to kill and peel the skin off your face
And watch the blood spill on the mental illa killa
Who loves to feel when I take your will to live
You give your soul
And then you burn deep, deep, deep below
9 times hotter than the fire on Earth
Your skin will melt and then your eyes will burst
This is the curse of the Lord Infamous
This is the portrait of a serial killa

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
I tried to recall the events of the night before
I stand in a hall of bloody tracks on the floor
Voices keep haunting me, tellin' me to do evil things
And when I fall asleep, a machete swings
The screams are muffled when the blade makes contact
The demons are quiet now but in night time they come back
Visions of bodies, decapitated and sliced up
... remains ...
I feel like one day I might go after my family
Cause I can't control the other person inside of me
I stare in the mirror and look deep at my features
The metamorphosis transform me from a man to a creature
The darkness hugs me and once again I'm on the prowl for a man livin' a psychotic lifestyle
The light goes off in my head, another life is lost
Voices of me and my victims stuck in a holocaust
I reign (?) from the pits of hell and if I don't kill'em my head begins to sweat
How many can I take out in just one night?
It just depends on the sturdiness of my knife
I start sweatin' like hell ... wake up (?) bloody sheets
It began in dream but now I can feel
The nightmares become reality in the portrait of a serial killa
