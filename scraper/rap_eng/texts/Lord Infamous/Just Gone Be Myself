[Hook]
Everybody is the crook and everybody got them bricks
How do you do all that and still got time for studio hits?
Everybody is the mob, affiliated with a gang
I believe mostly you scared, just need some backup mane
Everybody just like everybody else
Well I'm the Scarecrow mane I just gone be myself
Everybody just like everybody else
Well I'm the Scarecrow mane I just gone be myself

[Bridge]
Which one of these gangsters is doin' his own thang?
Which one of these gangsters is not the same?
Most of these rappers wussies and they won't do a damn thang
And I don't give a damn about what set you claim

[Verse 1]
BLAY!
I am Lord Infamous and I achieved everything in this game that you dream about
Even the ones that don't know me by name they have heard of my fame ... you clowns
From a town with no mighty or status
Man you can't get violated
More your name ring in these streets
The quickly you can't get annihilated
City of no pity, enough of you make it
The more will you fall off and suffer
The more you need 'em
The more they gonna kick you and you in the gutter
Nobody's straight and nobody's safe
You a fool for puttin' faith in the fake
And it's too late when the flesh show
And you find out that you got some (?)

[Hook]
Everybody is the crook and everybody got them bricks
How do you do all that and still got time for studio hits?
Everybody is the mob, affiliated with a gang
I believe mostly you scared, just need some backup mane
Everybody just like everybody else
Well I'm the Scarecrow mane I just gone be myself
Everybody just like everybody else
Well I'm the Scarecrow mane I just gone be myself

[Verse 2]
Believe none of what you hear and 'bout half of what you see
Cause the (?) be may fakers seem like dumps on the street
Behind the scene there's a whole team, matchin' 'em like a puzzle picture
There's some gifted and unique but also puppets on the string
(?) who go dance and sing and leave the money up to music
"Yes sir boss, I's a good boy, whatever you say, sign anything"
Most these videos are image, don't believe all these gimmicks
Cause they caught a charge for flaudgin', most will get the damn death sentence
I'm not pointin' out (?) but real recognize this kind
Most these kinds ain't killin' nothin' and they lettin' nothin' die
Brothers argue over rappers, sayin' "who got this and that"
Why you on this nigga jock and he ain't cuttin' you no check?

[Hook]
Everybody is the crook and everybody got them bricks

Everybody just like everybody else
Well I'm the Scarecrow mane I just gone be myself
