[Hook: C-Rock]
Hitmen in this hoe when we are family, insanity
Choppin' body parts into infinity, my Tennessee's
React to (?) reflex, my enemies were sent to me
Leave a bloody mess up on the ceiling, now a memory
Scattered bladders, I don't give a piss about a ratta-tatta
Surgical steel placed, I open up your chest, now blood splatters
Beggin' me to stop or save yo (?) because it do not matter
Welcome to the dark side, now reducing you to human cattle

[Verse 1: Lil Jack]
Witnessing pain from these motherfucking buckshots
Mind twisted, bliss from hallucinations, ammunition spittin'
Here a niggas face is pointed fourties and thirty, thirty, thirty gauges
Massacre, mind gone and thrown off coke
Nine chromes and blown off throats
(?) out the sun roof, move, we shoot
With the chrome tec nine and a black deuce deuce
With the mask out, tryin' to (?) shock
Seventeen shot, double M Glock
Nervous with a hole in his skull
(?) gettin' dug, swerve to the curb
Reefer, Hennessy
Bringin' out my Manson Tennessee's
I pistol whoop a motherfucker til I think he dead
It's the four shot mag and a carcass ready
Silencers, calibers, thinkin' 'bout a chainsaw massacre
Head straight to da door with da calico
Uh, gone off a pile of coke
Slug to the motherfucking chamber
Ski mask you scary bitch
Pistol grip, snub-nose, thirty gauge hammers
We ride you scary bitch

[Verse 2: C-Rock]
Homicide ain't no option, it's just the choice to kill a nigga
Feel a nigga when I leave a nigga rotting
Organs fall out his body, open 'em up with a surgeon steel
Label this the autopsy
Niggas can't rob me, take it from me, take it from me
It's like a nigga givin' up his will to breathe
I never feel defeat, so when I feel the beat
I really talk about the shit a nigga do in these streets
"You better watchin'" this what these niggas was sayin'
About me, so why a nigga wanna doubt me
Motherfuckers ride deep in the eight street
Killa be's droppin' bullets off in yo ass and yo family
M-A-N-S-O-N, we some murderers
Pull the nigga out that's talkin' shit and we gon' fuck him up
Russian roulette with a bullet, you lucky son
Now that you know about (?) what is up
Nigga better duck, I got a porch like a truck
Get the nine (?) won't bust
And it's no love, wrap a body in the rug
Put him in the fireplace and watch it turn to dust
I got a bloodlust, feel like chopping 'em up
Body parts in the motherfuckin' trunk tucked
... Chevy outside full of rust
(?) tanks and I'm still ridin' high as fuck, nigga what

[Hook: C-Rock]

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
Yes I got merchandise, this is a merchant's price
Yes I got what you like, sell your soul for this ice
If you want coca-in-ah, drop it straight on the Beamer
Eyes poppin' out the socket, grindin' down all yo teeth-ah
Potent of opiates, Opana down to that boy
Push it into your veins, nod off the feel of joy
Heroin in grey and beige, these bitches; they will obey
These niggas they noddin', about to fall on they fuckin' face
Sex on that Tussionex, yes it's that yellow dick
Put a line on her ass, sniff it right off the bitch
Yes and I sell 'em too, she choose me; she choose a fool
Come to gorilla school, I beat you, you break the rules
Yes I'm the Scarecrow, drugs and pimpin' I'm raised on
I'm from that killa M, you pop or get popped on
You need it, we got it, you want it we sell in packets
And push it
I roll it, don't tell it, I'll kill you, you lookin'
