[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow fulfillin' a prophecy
You hoe ass niggas can't stop a G
All you can do is (?) and bleed
My plan is (?) monopoly
Cockin' da chamber on two-two-three
Yo skull is convertable on your knee
And shit you niggas can offer me
I'm stickin' to Mafia warrior G's
Don't need alot of damn jewelry
To get a bitch droppin' her on her knees
Just need the weed, C-O-K-E
But sometimes I fuck off a little cheese
I don't make a ...
I do what I want, I don't fuck with police
... and go on a criminal spree
I'm tryin' to get me a scoop of the cream
What in the fuck is an American Dream?
Niggas I know that (?) screen
The power I snort is costly
The drank it got me (?) me
All I need is a super freak
That's lickin' me like a (?) P-O-P
Sprinkle the coke on my D-I-C-K
Dip my sickle in the plate
Got a (?) super brain
Fucked me till my dick was drained

Catch you in the Black Rain in yo black ice chain
Hokus-pokus gun to yo head and take everything
