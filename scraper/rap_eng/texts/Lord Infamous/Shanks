[Hook] 4x
Shanks nigga, shanks nigga
Gimme everything out yo bank nigga
Shanks nigga, shanks nigga
(?) gimme up them brains nigga

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
A struggle on concrete, they stick you in lock down for 23 and a half hours a day
Black Guerrilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood in this place where all the killers they play
Vice Lords and Gangster Disciples, the massacre mob, ain't no glass concernin' me
A killer sword into your jugular, ain't no damn surgery, ain't no infirmary
Come in this bitch with a nickle, next thing you know: you in this shithole for 15 years
Never come home, 'til your bitch move on, all your kids are grown, you got no kids
Mommy just died but you can't see the funeral and restraints set the fuckin' way
You contemplate suicide everyday, if you wanna live, nigga better sharpen that shank

[Verse 2: Lil Jack]
We got sickles and hatchets, kidnap 'em, detach all they h-izz-ead and drop 'em in baskets
Many razor blade gashes, murder with passion, stabbin 'em, yellin' out "Manson!"
With matchin' caskets full of (?)
Barely bashed 'em till they skull is fractured
You on some trash, you niggas stashin' hazards
Faggot bastards, wreck disaster, get cast-e-rated
Don't get decapitated
My guillotine hit his neck, his life evaporated
I got a couple gangsta bitches with me masturbatin'
She told me "Gucci Mane gay be exaggeratin'"
Shanks nigga, you a tame nigga
I pull rank I started (?) nigga
Shanks nigga, shanks nigga
These rappers ain't hard as you think, nigga

[Hook] 4x

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
You bitches soft, oh so soft, got no balls, ripped and robbed
On that yard, callin' god, save me god, salad toss
This ain't Oz, prison guards, just like Ricky Ross
Lickin' out yo asshole raw, strikin' like a lightning rod
Sidle lambs into the slaughter (?) tripped 'em, whip them harder
40 Glocc should be ashamed, how you got punked by The Game
Penetration is severe, put a slug in his inner ear
When it came up out the rear of his brains, windshield just got smeared
I'll expose all rappers actors, y'all just pose, you niggas hoes
If you came up with that role bitch, I will whoop you out yo clothes
Don't believe everything you see, I don't hate, I'm just sick of fakes
Even (?) end up lurking, have him evade a stang
