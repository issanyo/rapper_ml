[Hook: Kingpin Skinny Pimp] 2x
They talkin' like hittaz but y'all ain't no killaz
They talkin' like hittaz but y'all ain't no killaz
They talkin' like hittaz but y'all ain't no killaz
We comin' and dumpin' and shoot on you niggas
We duckin' and buckin', get found by the river
I squeeze like some scissors when poppin' them triggers
I aim so close-range you gon' hear that bitch whistle
(?)

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
Talkin' that shit like you killa but you know that you are not ready to blast
(?) they shit on they self right in public if they have to step in the mass
I am a master when it comes to goin' to war bitch, I'm actually ahead of my class
We tear da club up and dump body parts in the river, my enemies left in the grass
Step to our turf and see if you can manage, my shooters specialized in doin' damage
Fuckin' with slimy niggas in the street'll turn a god-fearin' man to a manic
Sick in the head, really (?) sick of playa hatin' pussy niggas on the planet
Put 'em to bed with the Smith & Wesson, blow a nigga brains, leave 'em on the canvas
I see ya heart got alotta envy, nigga you a flaudge, you ain't got a penny
Profits out yo pocket, you gon' die broke hearted nigga runnin' up on Rock and Skinny
Shout out to Lord Infamous and GimiSum, and the 6th Enterprise with me
Some of these niggas be sayin' they killa but really the sucker niggas of the city
For real

They talkin' like hittaz but y'all ain't no killaz

[Verse 2: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
This that type of shit that'll make you click so get yo ass in
Hurst Village projects, you know where I'm from
Skinny Pimp reppin' North Memphis - I'm Kingpin
Been had the plug, I ain't never ran off
I can get you some work and even get the shit out
All it's gon' take is one phone call
I bet I can fill up a motherfuckin' u-haul
Sittin' in the hood, countin' money on the floor
My guy scrapped like (?) while he peekin' out the window
Don't pop up at my house young nigga!
I told y'all bitches y'all niggas ain't no killaz!
C-izz-ars p-izz-arked in my backyard, stash box cost 10k
I call up AK and he bringin' them K's
All the hustlers in my circle paid
I know some ballers but they ass be hawkin'
Can't fuck up with bitches cause they ass be stalkin'
I cut off broke niggas cause they ass be talkin'
They ask you to throw on some (?) shit too often
I'm in the fast lane and you movin' slow
You stealin' from me and I shoot out yo throat
A OG in Memphis so I know the rules
I come from the city of "Hustle or hoe"
Salute all young niggas with money and grow
Skinny Pimp break a hoe, peelin' my foes
Throw up my hood every city I go
I'm like B. B. King - I made up that flow

We duckin' and buckin', get found by the river
I squeeze like some scissors when poppin' them triggers
I aim so close-range you gon' hear that bitch whistle
