I'm so hi', all I smell like is smoke
Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that god damn dope

Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that god damn dope

Yeah, that motherfucking green; yeah, that god damn dope

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I fucks wit' that light green
I fucks wit' that dr-izz-o hoe
I puts fire to the tail
I smokes till it is no mo'
I fucks wit' this hotel
I gots towels to the do'
I fucks wit' this freaky ho
That's down fo' the dicky blow
I'm blazin' this sticky, but never mixing it wit my coke
This one right here for the nose
This one right here for the smoke
This one right here rolled in dollars
This one right here rolled in blunt
I'm taking sniffs from the Vicks
I'm wildin' like niggas stunt
This the biz

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
1st you get the Swishers
2nd buy the liquor
3rd find some of that sticky, most smokers call it sticker
Can't forget the Newports, something long not too short
Call my nigga Big Triece, bring that blow to snizzort
I'm high ass fucking lizzy
I'm stressin' how I'm livin'
Oh please, oh please, oh please
Just give me just one mo' hizzit
This hydro weed I got some
I might blow you a shotgun
But if you can't play hizzalf
I guess yo ass don't want none

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
Give me weed, give me green
Give me something wit no seed
Give me something I can break down
With no sticks, if you understand me
It don't makes no d if its crumbled or bud
Just give it give it to me
And my hand will gently tuck
In yo hand you will see is a big face from me
Tell my nigga pass me that swisher
So I can roll up this weed
Gently fillin up wit weed
With the choice of that sweet
Then my nigga looked at me
And we start to repeat

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
Yo, I be smokin' out daily
Maybe get up on some hazy
Then remote and faded baby
Cause you niggas drive me crazy
Still, a lady when I'm escalated
Faded with my peeps
Bobby Brown smokin' niggas know not to even step to me
When I'm high I ain't gon' lie
I'm feeling freaky up inside
You wanna keep it on the low
I put my truck on the other side
Nigga, nigga what'chu mean
Gangsta Boo be on that green
Looking good up on the scene
Posted up naw mean?

[Hook: Crunchy Black]

[Verse 5: Lord Infamous]
Gone on the pills 'at I pop
Yes, I black out a lil' lot
Smoke too much hydro crop
I'm takin' it up a notch
W-H-I-T-E
It does stranger things to me
I'm paralyzed from the P
I'm tootin' up tons of D
Narcotics from coca plants
I sniffed up an avalanche
I'm going into a trance
Da deadliest demon man
Scarecrow, Keyser Soze
Yo, pass me that saucer tray
Or pass me a blunt of hay
I wanna just drift away, drift away

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
I be smokin' on motherfuckin weed and chiefin'
Y'all hear me sayin' satanic prayers over dead bodies
This ganja got me crazy
This haze has got me doomed
Gotta blaze a blunt into me
Fo just step into the chiefin' room
Fuck the city with the chicken
Chief the chicken, roll the chicken
Smoking got the chicken out there dirty
With a lot of sticky
Hear me this sayin': I think I blowed a pound
Now I see me a little silhouetto of a man

[Outro: Crunchy Black]
Yeah that mothafucking green
Yeah that mothafucking green
Yeah that mothafucking green
Yeah that got damn dope
