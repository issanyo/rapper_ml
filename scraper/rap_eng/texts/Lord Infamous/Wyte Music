[1st Verse, Shamrock]
Yea, uh
Wyte music, white rapper
Everybody like "Look at that white bastard"
First in TV, now the CD
Then the clothes, I been had hoes
Draped up in young from head to toe
Stacks and verses from all these shows
Been around the world rock coast to coast
I'm not supposed to boast but the flow is cold
So I kick doors like it was a jack boy
But I get dough so I'mma stack boy
Momma told me you don't know how to act boy
So I hit Rob said I need a track for it
Not hollywood but I still make movies
Ready for my closeup cameras zoomin'
Gotta keep magnums for all these groupies
Cause P and Wyte my Paul and Juicy
We in stores and we on tour
We rock the stage they want an encore
They scream louder cause they want more
So everytime I rock it I give 'em what they want for
Who am I to deny the people
They still here and they deserve a sequel
No dummy train this is money train
And them haters over there lookin' funny mane
From the

[2nd Verse, Lord Infamous]
INFAMOUS! BLAY!
Scarecrow tha terrible
In the coffin with the sickle...
Making the trip with that .50 cal playa
Well nigga I bring it and cripple
Tha Infamous known as tha ripper
Hit with a piece of a murderous beast
Catches increase, fire decease
Critically in a facility
With ya ability
(?) get mentally injury
Trauma, visibly
Drama, instantly
Put in a coma and brought out with misery
Scarecrow I'm flyin' by rain
I'm bringing the pain on a nigga
That wanna get over me
Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe
This drug shit I put up my nose
I love murder so much
That I carve corpses with X and O's
Picking flower petals saying
"She loves me, she loves me not"
But it's just a spring fling
Cause her body starts to stink and rot
Torture is my foreplace
I shut doors now thats a moray
When it comes to cooking body
Lord is a gourmet
