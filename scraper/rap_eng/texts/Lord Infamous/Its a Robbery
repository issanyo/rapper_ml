[Hook: T-Rock]
Got away with all the bricks and the opposition went against ... resist
If the nigga little brother wanna go to war with us we can do it on some bonafide G-shit
My dawg I'm hungry as ever, so I cook with the burner
It's a robbery nigga, don't turn it into a murder
Got away with all the bricks and the opposition went against ... resist
If the nigga little brother wanna go to war with us we can do it on some bonafide G-shit
My dawg I'm hungry as ever, so I cook with the burner
It's a robbery nigga, don't turn it into a murder

[Verse 1: Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Gimi Sum, skimask on my face
When I go and take care my business on pussy ass lames
You know what I'm comin' for, get on da floor
Go get that dope 'fore I smack up ya hoe
You movin' too slow like you think it's a joke
Now the gun in yo throat, nigga cough up that dope
My niggas they with me and never too nervous
They ... while I go on the vault
I don't give a fuck if yo ass got a clue
I'm a North Memphis nigga, what you wanna do?
Keep on talkin' shit nigga, I'ma come and see you
My young niggas squeezin' big triggers like a sumo
They go and hit his face, don't play with 'em
(?) damn fool, I ain't straight with 'em
Bitch I get money surrounded by hitters
Don't make me turn evil and send out them killers
I come through them bushes and then shot you pussies
I break up a ... I let loose some bullets
Suspectin' niggas, they duckin' and buckin'
Yo neighbors they lookin' but they don't see nothin'
Detectives ask questions but they don't say nothin' (I'm coming back)
Drop it off, take a loss, I'm countin' this money
You flaudgin' too much on the block
So I gotta take some from you just to make you soft niggas cry

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
I was down on my luck at the bottom of the barrel of the money so I gotta make a stang quick
Got a call from my nigga Skinny Pimp from the M-Town, 'bout to put me on an insane lick
I teamed up with the 6th Enterprise crime boss Lord Infamous and niggas who I bang with
Motivated by the lack of money and (?) as we about the profit so we do it to remain rich
I'ma keep it (?) real, a robbery is never meanin' shit to me, it really ain't worth it
Skinny told me on top "I'm a man of faith, I would never bring it to him if he ain't deserve it"
So we loaded up the weaponry and then he started tellin' me about the keys that the nigga keep at night
He was a middle man for his little brother ... and he beat his wife
I got a call from a crackhead around the corner for a couple stones, now it's on nigga, let's work
When we got him to the house ... .44, (?) lock off da door of a network
211 ain't no thing when you fuckin' with the mafia niggas, I think you can say we experts
Here to bring another death call ..., turnin' white T's into bloody red shirts

[Verse 3: Lord Infamous]
I'mma drill 'em with a deadly dose of venom
Put they brains up on the spinning fan they placed up on the ceiling
When the milli get the rippin' nigga body get the tippin'
When I hit them with the .20 gauge he permanentally limpin'
Did I mention that I'm sniffin on some coke, I'm numb and trippin'
Slippin' on the isotoner, goin' on a mission
Can't forget to get the other damn tools out the kitchen
Packin' ammunition, goin' on a expedition
When I catch a nigga slippin' I'ma smack him with the pimpin'
Taking everything, I even got a nigga strippin'
Bitch nigga may have some dope thats hidden
Bitch strip too, don't make me have to pin him
Infamous the Scarecrow, nothing you prepare for
Don't you turn around, bitch you better be careful
Sleeping with the devil if you wanna try a nigga
That's psychopathic ratchet on a whole nother level
Kicking in the front end with the chrome barrel gauge
Nigga try to run, catch some buckshot-spray
Flambated on the ground, brain decay
This shit can happen quick or it can go another way
Your guts splattered mane, all over the place
I suggest you go along and co-operate
'fore you end up in a fucking bodybag today
.50 cal round through the vest and the trauma plate
