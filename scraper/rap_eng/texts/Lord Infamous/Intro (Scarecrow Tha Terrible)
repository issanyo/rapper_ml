[Intro]
The name says it all
His appetites were legendary
He lusted after power
Killing anyone that got in his way
He lusted after blood
... torturing and slaughtering the entire town
He lusted after women
And while he was committing
His multiple crimes and sins
He has taught terrible
Well however, this centurys greatest butcher

[Hook] 2x
You don't want no parts of this dark art, black ox in camouflage
.50 cal will tear your head apart, man it's like a mirage
Black hearts of dark arts, voodoo torture
Black heart from red mars, voodoo torture

[Verse]
The sinister technique will get aggrevated
I mutilate with an incision of hatred
The Triple 6 torture that Lord is creatin'
Just look in my eyes ... satan
Infiltratin', soul evadin', cocaine bladin', blood cravin'
Black raven, Keyser Satan, life takin' got me salivatin'
My mind phases a wicked maze of last days with a cannibal taste
Bite you on your fuckin' face, your soul erased man, fuck a case
I'm on his flesh, cremate him, put his ashes in a vase
And tie a ribbon round that bitch until I mail it to his mammys place
Infamous is a damn savage
I practice black magic and chaos, and mayhem, and havoc
This shit will get tragic, I spray automatics
Eliminate faggots with poisonous packets
Demonic dragon, body draggin'
Flesh is tearin', bones is crackin'
Feed you to the maggots
While you garglin' up your guts and gaggin'

[Hook] 2x
You don't want no parts of this dark art, black ox camouflage
.50 cal will tear your head apart, man it's like a mirage
Black hearts of dark arts, voodoo torture
Black heart from red mars, voodoo torture
