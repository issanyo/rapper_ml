[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Me and my niggas'll train yo' bitch
Stole her purse and stang yo' bitch
All you did was take a shot
And ball the fist to close the fist
Kissing at the mall in Memph'
Hold the hands and love the shit
Hope you ain't on ecstasy
Don't you know she used to trick
Open the door you probably pressed
To take your time to fucking sex
Never would I wear that sweater
Knowing she'd be chewing pecker
All my boys the more the better
Not a week but when you met her
Spits the swallow while she asks
That's as if you gon' eat me now

[Verse 2: D.J. Paul]
Now nigga (nigga) what?
What the fuck?
I'm all about them freaky hoes
That like to suck
Them broads wit' them booty blowin'
Now that's the bidness
I let this candid camera for sho'
Be my witness
Them boys wit the can't block it
Get them round
Wit' them boys that can't rock it
Drink some crown wit it
Niggas wit some videos
Or some college hoes
That playin' hard to get
But they the freakiest (freakiest)

[Hook: Juicy J]
Let me feel let me feel let me feel your tongue ring
Let me, Let me feel let me feel let me feel your tongue ring
Let me, Let me feel let me feel let me feel your tongue ring
Let me feel your tongue ring

Let me, Let me feel let me feel let me feel your tongue ring
Let me, Let me feel let me feel let me feel your tongue ring
Let me feel your tongue ring
Let me feel your tongue ring

[Verse 3: ​Gangsta Boo]
I be fucking this nigga
Straight corrupting this nigga
Pussy wet as a river
You need a boat for me nigga
I be hot as a fire
Oh my God I'm on fire
I be tellin' these boys
I do my thang when I'm higher
Come on baby just lay down
Or to bed with me baby
I be triple the playin'
The triple pleasure I'm sayin'
I be comin' with cha'
If your freaky like me
If your freaky, im sneaky
Hey undercover watch me
Strawberries and ice
Not the ice on yo' wrist
Got yo' niggas dick brick
See me rubbin' my clit
(rubbin' rubbin' my clit)
Suckin' (suckin') my tits
Camcorder got me staring high
In my first flick
I be major with mine, I don't fuck all the time
I don't need you, please believe me
Nigga only when I'm in the mood for a quick
A quick ride on the dick
Through a razor in my mouth
Straight slicin' yo' shit

Lick ya dick, a talk ya twirl
All to know ya' toes will curl
And then your dick will start to hurl

Just waitin' to lick a nigga nuts
Quickly gettin' naked
Skinny dick, she'll stretch it
Pussy stayin' wet, and she loves when niggas wreck it

Mad that I stole her bitches, (?) bitches

Plenty bitches, hairy bitches, even them smelly bitches
Red ass bitches be them pathetic bitches

Bruised up my blue suede boots
Son of a bitch you gone feel the noose
