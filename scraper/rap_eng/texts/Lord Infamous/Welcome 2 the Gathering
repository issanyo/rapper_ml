[Intro: Lil Wyte]
Yea, yea
It's yo boy Lil Wyte
We are at the gathering of the juggalos
If you are ready to get high
Sing with me
If you are ready to get drunk
Sing with me
And fucked up
Follow me

[Hook]
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
We all family
We all family
We all family

[Verse 1: Lil Wyte]
Everybody good morning
This is the gathering of the juggalos
I'm Lil Wyte your host
For the next hour or so, so let's go
Anybody been to the drug bridge yet?
I'm looking for a little bit of that Killa
Sike just playing, I came here high and drunk
And I brought my own drug dealer
This is a party I attended last year
And I won't miss another one
I'm ready to get plastered for the next 2 days
And have some fuckin' fun
My eyes are ready to get red
Get tired and see some things
Last year I met Ron Jeremy
This year I wanna meet Charlie Sheen
I rock the house
Whenever I come out of my fucking cave
Did about 150 shows this year
Bitch I'm getting paid
But I still got time to take a small vaca'
The truth and while I'm here
The whole time you'll hear me hollerin'
WHOOP WHOOP

[Hook]
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
We all family
We all family
We all family
We all family

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Yeah
Infamous wrappin' the corpse in a Snuggie
I'm dumpin' the body and doin' the Doug-E
All of the gathering
Maybe have something called overdose
And the Lord Infamous lovely
Crow and the Juggalos whit residue on our nose
Microdots is filled over with dope
Every place that I go they got pistols and powder
That double (?) hoes
I'm plastered, sippin' on Shasta
Crossing the ICP, that's a disaster
Lyrical massacre, painted faces
Of our races, ready to smash ya
Ain't no clowns performing tricks
This ain't no David Copperfield shit
But we can make your bitch disappear
Her panties found in the mosh pit
Amphetamines and barbiturates stay to my lips
Got my own dilaudid drip
Whoop whoop, I got two two
I'm taking a mega wiff
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter, Crow Voorhees
When you hear the BLAY!
Get out the way, I spray with ICP

[Hook]
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
We all family
We all family
We all family
We all family

[Verse 3: Liquid Assassin]
I said I brush my shoes on that welcome mat
Third time I've been welcome back
Got up on stage and felt the impact
Of a group of fans (?) set up a (?)
Bottle of booze and a pill tonight
High as the moon and I'm feelin' like
A bucket of beer and I kill the mic
And the whole crew hype over Lil Wyte
And from the beginning
I felt a hell of a motivation
To get up on stage and to rap
And perform, no hating
Chillin' with the fans
That be movin' and moshin'
The greatest party of all time
Coming together to form an invasion
Sickest to spit it, Illest to rip it
Tp deliver lyrics, ridicilous
I lyrically paint a picture with me and Lil Wyzzle
Afizzle a nigga stick a bitch
Gathering my ritual killing, a real lyricist
Most passionate rapper
Matter of fact I'm a snapper
And I'mma attack like an automatic
That clap then I'mma stash her
Killin for the fans
That are ready for partying
After got on top of ther haters
Haters are hardly a factor
Killin every minute that I rock the show
Only time of the year that I got to go
Gathering Liquid Assassin repping it 4-2
Can't wait to hit the stage for the fans that go:

[Hook] 3x
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop
Whoop whoop

We all family
