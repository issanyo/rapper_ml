[Intro: Lord Infamous talking]
Lord Infamous, the bloody bloody Scarecrow
Demonic mode bitch!
J Blaque, DJ Fire, it goes down like this
BLAY! Demonic shit...

[Hook: DJ Fire]

[Hook: DJ Fire]

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Keyser Soze or the Scarecrow the savage
I ravage with thirty heat burns on the skin
When I look in the hearts of the men
I start slashing the ventricle artery and leave it within
Eyes start to roll in yo skull and you havin' convulsions
You feelin' the after-life forces
Your soul is chosen, skin turns cold
Effects of rigor mortis
Soarin' into orbit, all the voltage, you absorbed it
And it may seems kinda morbid
Seen your own corpse in the morgue
Mortuary, somewhere lyin' in the prairie
Where they all are buried, hopin' that's some fairy
"Come take me somewhere where it ain't scary"
But I'm the contrary
You're in the hands of the one they call Lucifer now
You can cry much as you want, better yet scream and shout
But there's no way yo ass gettin' out BLAY!
I am Lord Infamous murdered through the Middle Ages all up to the day
(?) all the particles of all the people I slayed
(?) with blizzard all up to your way
Here's a clip I load from the mystical (?) psycho
When this pistol smoke, it is critical, you get on the floor
I mesmerize pacific through atlantic with satanic
Those from this erratic attic automatic babbage faggot
