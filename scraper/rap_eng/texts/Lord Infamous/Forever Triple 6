Yeah yeah...
It's a long story, it's a long road motherfucker

[Verse]
BLAY!
Five oh five (?) live born in Magnolia in Castalia
Bought some dope in Orange Mound on Cella street
Lil Lord was raisin' terror
Fell in love with my first piece of ass
And bailed down to South Memphis
Paul was rulin' BHZ the mixtape boomin' with the quickness
Never ... put me on more gangsta shit
Next thing you know standin' in the Six
Black flag in right pocket
... Koop, Juice, Crunch, Skinny, Boo, my nigga Koop
Then my mind saw triple sixes therefore we should name that group
Never thought in a million years this shit would ever come to this
Foreigners on the Net rappin' my shit don't even speak english
If I could turn back the hands of time it wouldn't end like this
But I would go to war any day, forever Triple 6
