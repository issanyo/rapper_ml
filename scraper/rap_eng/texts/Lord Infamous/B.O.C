[Intro: T-Rock]
Black Rain, nigga
Y'all know who it is, nigga
Black Rain in this motherfucker (A-Town)
Lord Infamous in this muh'fucker (Memphis, Ten)
Rock Solid Music is definitely in this bitch, y'all know who it is, nigga (Uh hun)
This ya boy, T-Rock, nigga (Southside)
We came to squash all that bullshit
Y'all know how real it is (Real niggas get to the money, we breakin' bitches, nigga)
Money over bitches (This some pimp shit for you young nigga's minds)
We ballin' and breakin' hoes (Look)
Tell 'em, nigga

[Chorus: T-Rock]
We ballin' and breakin' hoes, achievin' it, gettin' dough
Choppin' on 24"s, I'm pimpin' out of control
Gettin' paper in rolls (Rolls)
Keep a hoe out her clothes (Clothes)
Bitches in every city, got bitches in every city
We ballin' and breakin' hoes, achievin' it, gettin' dough
Choppin' on 24"s, I'm pimpin' out of control
Gettin' paper in rolls (Rolls)
Keep a hoe out her clothes (Clothes)
Bitches in every city, got bitches in every city
We ballin' and breakin' hoes

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
These narcotics making the Infamous feel so erotic
I'm about to throw a motherfuckin' pussy party
Come from up so quickly, bustin' the guts of freaky sluts
Slide ya tongue down the pole, then ya lick up on the nuts
Must be flashy, classy, but must be super nasty
Hit the dope and then I hit her doggie-style like Lassie
And every time we have a little Clubhouse Click hoe-down
Pass the Pussy on the left hand side and lick me now
Four O's of Tuss' give dick the super powers
Bitch about to faint cause I been fuckin' her for hours
And when I'm on this trip, the dick won't go limp
I'mma try my very best to break your motherfuckin' hip
On the X and the 'yac
Some of this, some of that
Tryin' to make you like Quasimoto, hump in ya back
Turn that bitch into your prey
'fore you make that hoe your slave
Have that bitch rubbin' her pussy down with fuckin' Ben Gay

[Chorus: T-Rock]

[Verse 2: T-Rock]
We pimpin', peep the prognosis
Game is fearless, ferocious
Pimpin' hard and atrocious, my visions remain in focus
Picture me on your T.V makin' pimpin' look easy
Ain't no freebies
My bitches work nightly, monthly and weekly
Yo homie I keep it winnin', the product I push is women
Dolemite ain't got shit on the way I put down to pimpin'
I put your bitch out of business work with proper precision
Tell your mama: get with this or witness the game get vicious
I came to put fear in stitches, plus a dick in your misses
Don't be surprised if your bride is one of my bottom bitches
I politic with nothin' more than dimes and what
Hoes'll practice proper groomin'
Sellin' ass on websites
Sendin' me money through Western Union
Getting money from a check in this business, they put 'em on internet, peep out their intellect
Getting these bitches for once in their pocket, I'm all about process, I'm swoopin' in silhouette
Money got my pockets fatter than elephants, bitch, if it ain't about chips, it's irrelevant
Half the battle is image, I glisten my diamonds quicker than (???), I'm a bankin' it

[Chorus: T-Rock]

[Verse 3: II Tone]
It all started at the age of twelve
Servin' fiends and raisin' hell
These bitches say they love a nigga
"Can you make my pockets swell?"
Your conversation; time wastin', money is my motivation
Come and join the team, sellin' pussy is a occupation
Niggas out here grillin' lanes, savin' bitches, break the change
Your wife is a hoe nigga, go and let her do her thang
Crossin' T, dottin' I, who gon' be her aliby?
Hand that hoe a blunts if a bitch ever try to lie
Hard for a pimp, no it's harder for a mack
Pimpin' hoes, sellin' weed, sellin' blow, sellin' crack
Since the birth of me, pimpin' in my pedigree
Got my game, got my swag, got it all from Barber Lee
Got it down, bitch wipe the table with a big ass
And this slut come up short fo sho, she gon' beat her ass
She don't turn heads, motherfucker, cause she break necks
All about the cheese, peep game, we don't take checks

[Chorus: T-Rock]
