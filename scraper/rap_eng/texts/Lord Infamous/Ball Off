[Intro]
Yeah, Lord Infamous
The Scarecrow
Futuristic Rowdy Bounty Hunter
Enigma on the track
Black Rain bitch!
When you wanna jump
When you wanna jump

[Hook]
Smash the gas then ya ball off, ball off
Do your dance then ya ball off, ball off
Smash that nigga when ya haul off, haul off
Crash into 'em when ya haul off, haul off

[4x]
When you wanna jump (ball off)
When you wanna jump (haul off)

[Verse 1]
You putting your hands up on the damn steering wheel
Then you start smashing up on the gas
You ballin' all through the damn club
Then you hitting the brakes like you started to crash
Before you come fall in the club
Mane you sit in the car, gettin' high as you can
And look in your eyes; if they're not dilatin'
That means that you're not in a trance
And Lord (?) put a fuckin' body to rot
When I'm comin' like a crimson juggernaut
Have a nigga dig his own damn burial plot
When I blast I make it sharp
Make you fuckin' heart stop
You can't deny that the Infamous rockin'
Mane I am so detrimental to the game
Your ignorance make me (?) yo voice
... give me my fame

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Niggas defyin' the deadly Black Rain
I will make sure I cause some excruciating pain
Infamous not a hot-blooded mane
There's nothing but ice water in my veins
Want it all, yes I want every bit
And I will not stop until I get all my grip
So trick come equipped for a solar eclipse
If you slip get yo neck slit, pimp
Step up on a pedestal, you take a dose, you lose your life
Listenin' to my junt and you might be the one that die tonight
Scarecrow the Rowdy Bounty Hunter, crank that fuckin' sawed-off
Do your dance, smack that trick and then ya ball off

[Hook]

[Bridge] 2x
Nigga what you claimin', where you from?
(Smash him, ball off)
You don't know like that trick, get yo ass stomped
(Bitch and ball off)
I walk you off my nig, I came in this bitch amped
(Bitch ball off)
I leave you tucked away somewhere with yo shirt damped

[Hook]
