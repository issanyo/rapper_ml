[Hook: DJ Paul & Big Gipp]
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
In Memphis, I'm a felonist, don't fuck with ghetto presidents
Run up in your residence, gather all the evidence
Murder list is specialist, clickin' on this medicine
Unloadin' a Tec in this, hang you by your neck-a-lace
All in for the blessedness, Lord Infamous reck-a-less
Mobbin', I'm the messiest, best, there is no testin' this
Hellraiser, I'm hookin' 'em, four star chef, I'm cookin' 'em
Like that, now I'm bookin' 'em, snatch they eyes out look at 'em

[Verse 2: Crunchy Black]
What you know about killaz, what you know about dealers
What you know about niggas that live fake, know I'm for real-a
What you know about bitches, what you know about clickin'
One in the chamber so nigga now you know I'm out to get ya
What you know about robbing', what you know about mobbin'
Mobbin' all through the hood nigga doin' my job 'n
I ain't tryin' to be starvin', I'm just leg over barbin'
Poppin' shots at your head, nigga doin' my job 'n

[Hook: DJ Paul & Big Gipp]
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Juciy always be gamin', keep that roast to the flame 'n
Slangin' dope in the Grove, all the way to Black Haven
Call your boy on the cell, if you want somethin', hail
We got prostitutes and whitey-white just tryin' to make mail
Have you been to the North, Memphis where I be stayin'
Where them golds, they be shinin', nothin' but smiles on they faces
Always stumblin', rumblin', keep the freaky hoes comin'
If they wanna suck the dick, we put that nut in they stomach

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Ain't no problem that's to big, nigga fucked up 'bout no task
Two of them coloreds with them masks, sawed-off pumps for mega-blast
Forty-thousand, one in the chamber, buck artila for gettin' his own man
Nigga I'm my own man, never catch me runnin' from no man
It's so strange, the look on you face that does not bring
Or brings it to doors lane, put blood on your close lane
Your eyes be like closin', hoes from head to toes 'n
Fuck 'round with the chosen, got you stiff like posin'

[Hook: DJ Paul & Big Gipp]
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope
What you know? What you know?
'Bout the B's, bout that O
'Bout these streets, 'bout this 9
'Bout these niggas doin' time
What you know? What you know?
Bout the kickin' in the do'
Layin' suckers on the flo'
Gettin' low down with the dope

[Outro: Big Gipp & (Juicy J)]
Don't give a fuck, I'm stayin' slizzard
Tough like chicken gizzards, strickly 'Cardi, wizard
Pill popper, afro, straight blowed
Corner coves, what I'm talkin', what you know
'Bout that girl, 'bout that boy, keep that nose itchin'
Skin scrachin', junkies steady bitchin'
I can't feel it, nigga please, stop that actin', cough it up
4 for the 5, is what I'm sellin', sawed-off 12 'n started bailin'
Kickin' do's, snatchin' clothes, catchin' hoes, gettin' cases
Sittin' in the country thinkin' about my money on vacation
This for the ones that love the club pop, sip-sip
Gipp dip, In a ho, in the jail, rollin' crip
Keep it crackin', keep it throwed, who shot first, nobody knows
How it goes, what you know, 'bout these streets I'm down fo'
(ATL...)
