[Verse 1: Gangsta Boo]
Dope game - my game, hoes lame - it's a shame
How the Gangsta Boo is gonna click up on you bitches, mane
Gangsta Boo is not the kind of bitch that will like get punked out
Looks are so decieving stupid bitch do you wanna f-izz-ind out
How can ya fuck a playa
Playahataz better listen close
If you try to buck me bitch
I'm outie with you fucking soul
Yes the devils daughter
Kind of caught up bitch that wish the slip
Slip yo ass in a coffin bitch
Because you run your fuckin lip
Ho my game is thick
So stupid bitch dont ever test me ho
If I fucked up once
You fuck up twice
So ho you gotta go
Listen deep this pimpin
Really quick before I split your dome
Ho you trying to cross me in this game
And stupid ho its on

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Just a flodgin ass nigga
With a lot of cheese
Heard he stackin g's
Everyday pushin plenty keys
Nigga dont know me
Cause I ain't no phony
And I ain't the nigga you can whoop and call me Toby
Low key on his ass, waitin' for the night to come
So I can kick down his door and make him give me some
Bitch I with a little young nigga age thirteen
Fucked up in town while I watched yo ass ride clean
Now that Im grown up
From the hood I gained nuts
Nigga you gonna drop off that dope
Or feel the pain of a hollow tip
Rip through your shit or your fuckin brain
Thats what you get
When you choose to play the dope game
Bitch!

[Verse 3: DJ Paul]
I'm at the cut, droppin' the fiend down with the monkey nuts
I'm tired, I'm hittin' 'em short I gotta get over I don't give a fuck
The shit goes on from sun-up till sun-down and on the twelve I guess
But now its time cut the shit where's my mind at my best
I gotta test a nigga to see what he got can a fool
Make you straight a couple of g's, I need more cheese
I layin' it down on his face But don't waste time
I gotta roll straight through the shit sometimes I wonder will it end
Cause I rob for petty shit I'm riskin' my life pullin' yo card
After y'all push him off the wood grain a pop off his smile a one eight spot
I'm dodgin' the cops watchin' my b-izz-ag fools kinda like a snitch
But when I do my boys I find there house and go up in that shit

[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Check it out
Nigga I'm kickin' in doos, bodies are froze
Bloody ya clothes, gun to ya nose
All of you niggas you really need to give up money and dope
Face the floor, forty-four, into ya head, droppin 'em dead
Infamous fled, put them to bed, with the weight, then escape
Count the stacks, shine my gat, after I jack like a rat on the creep
All you dopehead niggas will get put to sleep
When I sneak, give up the dope or get a hole in yo cranium
You see this mean artilery you know it is containin' some
Shit that makes me flexible to make your life ejectible
And with this bullet in your brain you be dead either comotose
So when you pushin' candy with the Scarecrow comin to smoke you mane
Simple and plain, you'll get stanged, if you in the dope game, Bitch
