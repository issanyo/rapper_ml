[Hook]
We represent the hundred shot-kill
Put one in your pupil then I pop another pill
Skull fill up with blood and then it shoot up out your ear
Down the brick road with your soul in ethereal

[Verse 1]
May I interest you in a .500 cal. revolver slug?
Bust you in your mug, spill everything you thinkin' of
Don't be actin' all nervous and scared around me bitch
I crank this chainsaw blade and give your ass a dental fix
We represent the hundred shot-kill
I put a bullet everywhere except in your damn heel
Chill, put the dollar down, they 'bout to come outside
I won't be satisfied till they filled with formaldehyde
Got the Tommy gun, .45's, .50 drum
I hit you in the liver, make you shiver and go numb
Infamous I come from the land down under
Vomit up your stomach, leave your body in the tundra

[Hook]
We represent the hundred shot-kill
Put one in your pupil then I pop another pill
Skull fill up with blood and then it shoot up out your ear
Down the brick road with your soul in ethereal

[Verse 2]
This is the league of the criminal mind
Split the brains, watch the blood drip by the pint
Scarecrow I'm wishin' to tear out your spine
Half mutilated and frying your mind
Limbs, organs, iodine
The damn paramedics won't make it in time
Some shit is hangin' out your side
Go to sleep bitch, gonna be a long night
Stomp on your neck till you spit out your damn tongue
Snatch all yo teeth out your motherfucking gums
Scarecrow smells blood, man it's time to go hunt
Sharpen a machete, make you spill all your lunch
Dump your damn body in the potter's field
Suck a fuckin' slug and tear apart your grill
Wash your damn mouth out with some Massengill
Fuck around with Soze get your cabbage peeled

[Hook] 2x
We represent the hundred shot-kill
Put one in your pupil then I pop another pill
Skull fill up with blood and then it shoot up out your ear
Down the brick road with your soul in ethereal
