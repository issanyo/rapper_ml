[Hook] 2x
Scarecrow Skitzofrantic, bloody bloody battle axe
Bash him in his cataracts, feed him to my alley rats
Yeah hoe, it's like that, fuck you, you don't like it
Shoot that trick, I need a cigarette, give me a light bitch

[Verse 1]
Barge into the facility, walk straight to security
And I got that thrax and a pure sack and the MAK-90 on me
Eyes are dilated, I'm behavin' really devious
Crow is Horrorcore, you better read my Wikipedia
I can give a fuck less 'bout your fuckin' animosity
I will snap your neck like fuckin' Ted DiBiase
Beat your goddamn brain till it look like a bowl of cottage cheese
And I feel no sympathy, no pity, no apologies
Don't bother me homicide is talkin' out my slaughter spree
Deep into photography, a twisted psychology
You tough in the club, you pussy niggas are androgynous
Hermaphrodites and dikes, I ram and dive my dildo in your butt
C-4 for you suckers ain't worth a damn bullet cost too much
To waste on you wussies, cut your throat with fuckin' razor rust
Don't make me whack your ass with the .40 fader
Scarecrow, Soze, nigga Lord Vader

[Verse 2]
The vicious, the malicious, never misses, blow death kisses
Your corpse is in the ditch I sliced your neck 'bout 16 inches
The bloody bloody mystic yes I'm rappin' Triple Sixes
The Poltergeist tonight when this demonic pay a visit
I'm tearing off your skin and pourin' salt, oh I just ripped it
They'll never fix your jaw when I make you bite the curb and kick it
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, the Crow the killer musician
I cannot stop the killing spree it's doin' repetition
I'mma put a slug behind your ear and take your punkass fishin'
It's a murder fuckin' horror-service mass-murder-mission
I'mma need ammonia lye, bitch to clean this bloody kitchen
And like humpty dumpty the pieces you can't fix it
You'll never find, all the bodies that I hid in the pin
I tried to cover the odor with fuckin' lime
Sometimes I try to keep the fuckin' head and spine
I'm on a grind
