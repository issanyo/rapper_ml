[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
My name is the Scarecrow
Bustas they approach, they don't know me too well
I pull out twenty gauge pump and load the shotgun shells
Oh no not the buckshots, the one that's full of slugs
I pump it to his throat, this nigga donates blood
No I do not mind comitting genocide
No I do not mind comitting homicide
Although the way you live is how you must die
I will try to take yo life before you take mine
That's the way I see it, believe it, no secret
Cause what these hoes can't have
They ass will kill just to creep it
Cause niggas try to take the things you worked so hard for
But Scarecrow I can't go, I can't go, can't go
So I do what I have to do, I don't wanna kill you
But I will fool
Before Scarecrow will take a fall I spray all o' y'all
Goddamn, they got my back against the wall

[Verse 2: DJ Paul]
A quarter after 12, I'm just cruisin' down them backstreets
Scopin' for them bustas
Tryin' to leave 'em like lemons in these streets
The only thing on my mind is smokin' me a hotstick
And hookin' up with a bitch that sucks a real mean dick
I got my Tec megatron on the passenger side
Just for the ride, fuck a stash (?) ain't got time to hide
Cause when you see some niggas
On the back of group of punks
I ain't got time to pull to the curb, so popped the trunk
(?) they get closer tryin' to pull up on my left side
But if they let down the windows I'mma let the Luger spit
(?) they just cruisin', ain't made a fake move
Yet my tinted windows got 'em faded, they don't know what to expect
Start slowin' down and then windows start goin' down
Fallin' down my (?) these milli rounds
I crash out them tricks, crash (?) them all
My intentions wasn't to take their lives
But they had my back against the wall
