[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I'm a legend where I'm from, the nigga you want to become
When these words come up from lungs, I see you niggas turnin' on
Tennessee and Amityville, chainsaw massacre kill
When I feel a litte ill I go and pop me fifty pills
Or I drain my litte pains with some heroin in my veins
It may seem somewhat insane that I drink some pure cocaine
Lord Yoda, no soda, take a photo of my dojo
Hit you with the Han Solo in my Polo fuckin' boots lolo
Murderers, Robbers, Dealers, Killers
If you want some combat nigga put some nickel in ya ticker
This is the thrust that'll bust yo guts
And make you get up and do the fuckin' Memphis strut
