[Hook: Lord Infamous]
24/7 torture, your worst nightmare
Thats what hell is like
Pain that you could never imagine, bitch
Thats what hell is like
God can hear yo flesh beggin' and screamin'
Thats what hell is like
Eternally no sleep, forever agony
Thats what hell is like

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Bow down to the majesty, the sire King of Horrorcore
Slit you from your throat down to your groin, intestines on the floor
Get down on your knees and open your mouth and swallow this millimeter
Do as your bitch ass told, I ram this hole right through your fuckin' teeth
And I be demonic poltergeist, some say I'm antichrist
Fuck with me, I'll have your punkass walkin' towards that pretty light
Lord is fearin' all this glory, some man make it your purgatory
Second testament, well man, that's another story
... certain I will see you someone day
Standin' at yo deathbed to escort you to eternal place
I be surely gone insane and atheist my favorite class
Don't go screamin' Jesus when I ram this pitchfork up yo ass

Thats what hell is like

[Verse 2: Slim Money]
Young nigga #hellraiser
Sellin' like Riley with the fundraiser
Hell on earth or the streets
Straight blazin'
Volume up #origami
Sell your soul #illuminati
Shawty kicked up
Cause you prolly on a Molly
Hunting dreams just like freddy
Spit flames like a mountain dragon belly
You ain't ready
Went to hell and back #makaveli
When I go to sleep
I pray for my mind to ease
World war undeceased
One shotter head #guillotine
Smack you down #babypowder
You (?) my kush is louder
Satan make you read the bible
Preachin' just like revivals
Black Rain coke
Man gonna run a nation
You (?) leave his way
Then he died at the train station

[Verse 3: Mac Montese]
I really don't know what hell is like
I'm hopin' I make it trough the night
All this madness that I face
From a day-to-day basis is my life
I pray to god to save my soul
Keep me humble down the road
Watch over me in these streets
And make sure that I reach my goal
My son, the one that keep me breathin'
Other than that I have no reason
Just to make it in this world
Feelin' like I just lost my girl
Lord, can you hear my cry?
Take me away up in the sky
Livin' this hell on earth
Is got me trapped and thinkin' 'bout suicide
Then I just stop for a second
And think about my life
God he done bless me with everything
That I needed, right?
So I'm gon' keep on movin'
Provin' that I'm just trapped
Everytime I look up at the sky
I just have to smile
