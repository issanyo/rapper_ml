[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
This for all you playa haters who be talkin' that (ha, ha)
The Three 6 show no love, put some hurt on a trick
I'm bustin' through the crowd wild with my hand on a cannon
Be like quick to put two up in ya like who manna standin'
I be the last man, blast man
If you think you fast man, headlines
Three left 'em up in a cast man
When I look into your eyes I see a coward
Face to face I hit ya, Three 6 Mafia would rather die than

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Lord and here comes the two to the three and four
Three 6 Mafia I want ya to wreck it all over the club floor
Blowin' and throwin' your sets in the air
Ya bumpin' them tables and chairs everywhere
Trampled over by the macs and the playas
You standin' there actin' like you wonder where
It ain't said we the hardest
And you can't rock it like Three 6 Mafia can
All up in a trance in the prophecy van
We gonna tear the club up, get it bucked till it don't eel in me
[?]

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
We tearin' the club up, gettin' buck haters try to call it rough
They better call security, bring them straight jackets and handcuffs
Ain't takin' it, ain't takin' it the clutches I be breakin' it
And rippin' off the bosses and tossin' them to the floor, bricks
Going through the window, got that thing at your temple
When they bust, keep it trust and we ain't talkin' 'bout bustin' pimples
Haters can't get with the Mafia click, them fools ain't buck enough
We gonna get the dynamite trick and blow the club up

[Verse 4: Gangsta Boo]
Crazy lady comin' at you, you can't fade me trick
I bet you bet you bottom dollar make you holla
When my soldiers get ya, I don't like that violence stuff
But I believe in gettin' buck
If you with me, let me see you tear da, tear da club up
Mafia, Mafi-Mafia, won't stop with it though
Hypnotizing minds, we got you blind and you can't hear me though
Come and get it while you can trick, before it's all gone
Goin' once, goin' twice, oh my God it just went gone

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
Oh, oh, oh, get buck, get wild
Let's tear this house right down
Let's tear da club up thugs
Let's do that stuff right now
No disrespect to the clubs, don't want none of that
But you got the Three 6 Mafia up in your house and
And we came to break the law, tear da club up
Ashes to ashes no dust to dust
And you can't trust Three 6 Mafia when we tearin' that club up

[Hook: DJ Paul]
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up
Tear da club up, nigga, tear da club up

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Hypnotize I don't think they high enough
See I thought I told you to get buck and tear da club up
Do it like a lunatic since you down with the prophet click
Now can I blaze it kick it tell me can I kick it man
Since uh, [?] days gone, get hypnotized
Let's start a riot in the club, lets get wild tonight
One little, two little, three triple six members
Four little, five little, six triple six member
