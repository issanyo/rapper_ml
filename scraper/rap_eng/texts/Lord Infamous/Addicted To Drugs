[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Scarecrow me handle four (?)
When I'm high on this Tussin' with real high demeanor
I'm sippin' on Promethazine-ah
Like you motherfucking Aquafina, yeah
Even when still on this Codein or Tussionex
Flow like a Scarecrow (?)
You trick ass niggas do not know me remotely
I'm high on this dope and I hit you with (?), no please
(?) high on this drank (?) caused the knock down
Numero uno of dope for the Scarecrow
Overloaded on narcotic narco but I'm (?) mystic
Bitch I'm higher than fuckin' statistics
You tr-izz-icks, we might as well keep it realistic
I'm high on this shit, I need some freaky bitches
Four Oz. to the dick to the head I just swallowed
The cop moves his finger, my eyes will not follow
You take me to jail I will be out tomorrow
And back to my liquors and Tussionex bottle
I have an addiction I think that cannot be cured
(Lord I bet you can't kill all that) Lil Sko are you sure?
Cause I do it, I do it, run straight through it
And if you got some motherfuckin' money
Put some more dope to it
Cause my concept is so unconceivable
Like (?) my flows unbelievable
Bitch get off your asshole, go somewhere
And go retreat my dope
