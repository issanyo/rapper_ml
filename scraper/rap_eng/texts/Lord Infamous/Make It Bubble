[Hook]
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't need this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't want this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble

[Verse 1]
Chiefin' Cadillac Kush in a pineapple wrapper
Layin' in da cut with a loaded Bushmaster
Plates full of dust to stay up and watch traffic
Make a transaction in my zone, get ratta-tatted
Got enough arsenal to arm a small army
Wanna move some dope around here? Bitch you better warn me
And I expect payment everytime you make a transaction
Anybody in the click thats holdin' out skullbashin'
You don't want it mane, I'm specialized in torture tactics
Lord the black mamba, when I strike it's over for a faggot
I was born in these streets and I might die in 'em
And I tell these niggas "see you in hell" before I kill 'em

[Hook]
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't need this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't want this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble

[Verse 2]
My business hours are eleven pm to five
The graveyard shift, the time when many niggas face demise
Murderers, robbers, dealers, pimps and prostitutes
End up in the Mississippi in a fuckin' concrete suit
Rookie niggas just like sheep in a den of wolves
You get ate up in these streets, if you ain't got pull
Weak-minded, but you wanna play with they big boys
Somebody pull your hoe card and you quickly get destroyed
These niggas crack when the police start interrogatin'
Scared of the thunderdome and they manhood violated
So don't play these games, knowin' you a fuckin' lame
Get your ass knocked out the frame - Chiddy Bang Bang!

[Hook]
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't need this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble
In my zone, tryin' to take the throne for the struggle
Dummie goons gotta beat two for extra muscle
Any nigga wish to interfere with my hustle
You don't want this trouble man, I'm tryin' to make it bubble
