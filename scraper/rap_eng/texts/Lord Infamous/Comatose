[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Give 'em my overdose on this dust
I comatose every track that a nigga touch
Inject the pharmaceuticals into the blood
I take a piss test and melt trough the fucking cup
What!

[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
Bitch (?) ape I smack the skin off your face
For a moment till I keep a fuckin' head in my safe
I sniff a goddamn gram of black tar heroin every fuckin' day
.20 gauge bass will knock the roof off your fuckin' base
(boom, boom)
Trick or treat, bloody sheets, blow you out yo Nike sneaks
Lord of Terror be my (?) somewhere, I just saw this shit weak
Minotaur, I'm bizarre, machete will massacre
Down in panama, locked jaw, fish scale raw
Drug tolerance so high man, I can overdose the holy ghost
Gimme anesthesia, Fentanyl and some heroin dope
The doctor said: "It's a miracle that he not spiritual"
OD-ing habitual, I wake up then I get some mo'
COMATOSE!

[Skit]
Nine people were killed between Friday and Sunday and two more were gunned down just hours ago, a murder rate of two a day

Give 'em my overdose on this dust
I comatose every track that a nigga touch
Inject the pharmaceuticals into the blood
I take a piss test and melt trough the fucking cup
What!

[Verse 2: Yung Koke]
I feel niggas wanna do me and see me like Pac
That's why I'm one step ahead with my vest and my Glock
They wanna fill me with shots like I'm 50 and shit
I'm with that snatch a baby mama drama, cripple the bitch
I'm at the window with my gun on safety, niggas tryna take me
Informers call... Dick Tracy
Got a problem with the dumb hoes lovin' me, they be kissin' and huggin' me
Beat 'em once on my [?] discovery
I stay paranoid, pimpin, watch my friends and foes
(?) motherfucker I know
That's why I watch for the cops and keep my ears to the street
(?) hoes in yo sleep nigga

[Hook: Lord Infamous] 2x
Give 'em my overdose on this dust
I comatose every track that a nigga touch
Inject the pharmaceuticals into the blood
I take a piss test and melt trough the fucking cup
What!
