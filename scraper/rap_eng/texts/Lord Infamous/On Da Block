[Hook: Project Pat Sample]
The main nigga on the block where it's hot talking shit
Gon' be the main motherfucker somewhere dead in a ditch

[Verse 1]
I'm the bloody bloody Scarecrow, heartless vicious murderer
Hope you fuck up, I got some hot shit that I insert in ya
Sittin' in the pentagram made of cocaine powder
Fuckin' with this cannibal will get your guts devoured
They will find your corpse on the old porch, its very sour
Speedballin' on cocaine, fuckin' buzz for fuckin' hours
Starin' in the mirror tryin' to see if I still have a soul
Lucifer sent me these deadly scriptures, why? Man I don't know
I'm my own worst enemy, I feel no love, no sympathy
The sound of dying bodies man, to me, sounds like a symphony
When you add it all up it's a very simple equation
Face the bloody Scarecrow, all you face elimination

[Verse 2]
(I come to still kill and destroy)
I come to take away all that brings joy
I lose count when I count all my battle scars
I lose count of the bodies when on this Escobar
I wanna know what it's like to feel remorse or pain
But it's not me so I just dance in the black rain
I'm in the satanic church, come join my congregation
You wanna learn torture methods; I give demonstration
I have visions in hell right next to lucifer
He tells me to say all these things cause him my producer
I know most likey I will never see the gates of heaven
But I will be the legend for souls sent to deadland
