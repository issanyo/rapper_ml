[Hook]
We got the unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
The unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular

[Verse 1]
Bring me his head on a stick and send his balls to his momma
The quarter tackle, I stab in his back, morticians with the kama
Cold blooded reptile, straight from the Nile
Throw his body on a pile on the side of the Nile
Evil exile, evacuate the premises
I hope you are religious trick, got crucifixion pyramids
Hooks in your spine, hollow points to your mind
Billy club to your skull, have ya spittin' blood and puss
Take my time in torture techniques, Phd in pain-blood
Race 6th Enterprise, Lord, I'm deranged
Liquefy ya insides with formaldehyde
Stick a steel rod to your eyes, as I watch your skin fry

[Hook]
We got the unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
The unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular

[Verse 2]
I'll hang a clothes hanger through your eardrum, and it's a problem
When I cut off your ankles and make you go joggin'
Don't be the recipient, of this (?)
Have you bitches draggin' up like one of them Nigerians
Bump you in the Triple with the nickle
Leave a bloody dimple, your flesh make a ripple
Silver sickle slicing any etching
Got a can of soda ... have ya do some (?)
Knock my shoulders out the socket when I let you niggas get it
Don't think that you even feel it, D.O.A of impact
I'm a (?), Lord on that damn 'thrax
Somebody come and check his motherfuckin' vitals
Got the unit, got the body, got the corpse and (?)

[Hook]
We got the unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
The unit, the body, the casket, the corpse
The morgue, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
Of course, Formaldehyde into the jugular
