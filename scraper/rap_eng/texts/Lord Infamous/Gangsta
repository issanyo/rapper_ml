[Talking]
Yea mane I tell you about these
Tampon gangsta ass niggas mane
Motherfuckin' lice ...
Mane all you niggas eat dick mane

[Hook]
Fuck with me you fuckin' with the best
And you also fuckin' with the wrong one
I will hit you with the millimeter gun
Get the millimeter gun blow out yo lungs
Like them old Italians, Mafia gangsta son
When you see me comin' better run for fuckin' cover
BomBLAY, Mafia, Bomblay, Mafia
BomBLAY, Mafia, Bomblay, Mafia
BomBLAY, Mafia, Bomblay, Mafia
BomBLAY, Mafia, Bomblay, Mafia

[Verse 1]
Don't get smacked in the face with a Louisville slugger
Crack yo whole cranium into fragments like a puzzle
On this cocaine hustle, rabid dog need a muzzle
Do you in and throw your fuckin' carcass
To them damn buzzards
Cut yo tongue out yo mouth, have ya t-a-talk and stutter
Drag you bitches to the river, get you muddy muthafucker
Lord loc on this opiates and coke, don't provoke
Take a toke and blast a (?)-size hole in yo throat
Then I bury these niggas in back of a villa
PCP and painkillers, put yo brain in da blender

[Bridge]
Mystic styles of me ancient mutilations
Cross my path, there's gonna be some complication

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm a legend where I'm from, the nigga you want to become
When these words come up from lungs, I see you niggas turnin' on
Tennessee and Amityville, chainsaw massacre kill
When I feel a litte ill I go and pop me fifty pills
Or I drain my litte pains with some heroin in my veins
It may seem somewhat insane that I drink some pure cocaine
Lord Yoda, no soda, take a photo of my dojo
Hit you with the Han Solo in my Polo fuckin' boots lolo
Murderers, Robbers, Dealers, Killers
You want some combat nigga put some nickel in ya ticker
This is the thrust that'll bust yo guts
And make you get up and do the fuckin' Memphis damn strut

[Hook] 2x
