[Verse 1: Lord Infamous]
I'mma drill 'em with a deadly dose of venom
Put they brains up on the spinning fan they placed up on the ceiling
When the milli get the rippin' nigga body get the tippin'
When I hit them with the .20 gauge he permanentally limpin'
Did I mention that I'm sniffin on some coke, I'm numb and trippin'
Slippin' on the isotoner, goin' on a mission
Can't forget to get the other damn tools out the kitchen
Packin' ammunition, goin' on a expedition
When I catch a nigga slippin' I'ma smack him with the pimpin'
Taking everything, I even got a nigga strippin'
Bitch nigga may have some dope thats hidden
Bitch strip too, don't make me have to peel him
Infamous the Scarecrow, nothing you prepare for
Don't you turn around, bitch you better be careful
Sleeping with the devil if you wanna try a nigga that's psychopathic ratchet on a whole nother level
Kicking in the front end with the chrome barrel gauge
Nigga try to run, catch some buckshot-spray
Flambated on the ground, brain decay
This shit can happen quick or it can go another way
Your guts splattered mane, all over the place
I suggest you go along and co-operate
'fore you end up in a fucking bodybag today
.50 cal burn through the vest and the trauma plate

[Verse 2: Lil Jack]
Mane all I hang around is killers
Make me fuck around and drop you in a river
Hope that you can swim with your head gone nigga
Blowed off brains on your head stone nigga
Run off in his crib and now you get gone nigga
Nigga blooded then I pull up off the crime scene muggin'
Old people scared yellin' "ain't seen nothin'
Got a couple young niggas droppin' out bustin'
Yeah I'm a killa, nigga, fuck 'em
Used to wear the mask now I get 'em naked-face
I ain't try to hide Imma kill em anyway
Manson for life, got the chopper with the light
Run up on him slippin', its gon' be ya last night
Still take his head off, sawed-off and the Glocks
Single shot from the front, lock his ass in the trunk
Little J to the A to the K-illa bitch
All I hang around killa-killas bitch
Infamous grab the evidence, call the coroner
From Memphis to Texas, from Florida to Georgia
Merciless, me and Merciles ridin' shirtless
Burn his house down nigga, black suit hearse shit
You gon' get hurt bitch, shoot off in the church bitch
Fuckin' with a killa everybody gettin' murked shit
Do you really wanna die?
Shoot him in his face, knock his noodles out his eyes

[Verse 3: Merciles]
Bangin' with a bunch of killas get your head split with machete  They ain't fuckin' ready for the crazys from the dirty
Lunatics are bargin' closer to the city
Dirty nights of murder with the maniac
A nightmare with nobody wakin' up and never comin' back
I'm gettin ready for the slaughter
I said watch me do it, watch me kill swingin' harder
Track you trough the woods and then I'm dumpin' you and all your motherfuckin' friends inside the motherfuckin' water, murder
Gotta kill 'em all
Now I'm slippin' on the ski mask with my niggas Lord and little Jack
And I'm the bloody butcher comin' for you slippin' slutty hooker
Follow you at night and I be waitin' for the moment
Hopin' I can get rid of all feelings that you people called it
Sickness, be a witness to shit I call the work of art
And I'm like the BTK
Bitch who play the game in the brain with a whole lotta pain
Leavin' everybody hella trippin' lookin' at with little bit remains
I'mma bring you to the darkness where we get it done regardless
Ain't no feelings its the Merciles the hardest
Put a pitchfork through your throat
I'mma jab it in you slowly, watch you choke
In the chop shop where you can't escape
I'll walk up from behind and put an axe
Through your motherfuckin' shoulder blade
Laughin' at your screams, get it done by any means
Take a look up at a crook, say your last breaths
While I pick you up and leave you hanging from this motherfuckin' meat hook
