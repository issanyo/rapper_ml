[Hook][x2]
Turnt out, turnt out, turnt out, turnt out
Turnt out, turnt out, turnt out, turnt out
Turnt out, turnt out, turnt out, turnt out
Turnt out, turnt out, turnt out, turnt out

[Verse 1]
Her ass act so dumb, but got smarts, she turnt out
She [?] for fun, whoo, I’m turnt out
I’m turnt, I’m piped, I’m pumped, I’m geeked
She could be a nun, at noon, by one, she a freak
By two, I’m burned out, by three, she sonned out
4 5, she checked in, by 6, she returned out
By 7, the sun gone, by 8 the stars out
By 9 she getting dressed, she bartend

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
Talk cash she turned on, no dough she turned off
You at home and you turnt in, we turnt up, you turnt down
At first she didn’t like girls, she turned them down fast
Turned out to be a nympho, got turned on for that cash
Smart girl, smart girl, ain’t too much she ain’t learned about
She all about that paper, ain’t too much she concerned about
She clock in, she clock out, she count up, she earned out
She get up, she come in, she drink up, I’m turnt out
