[Hook 1]
That re-, that re-, that re-
To go back, to come back, to return
That re-, that re-, that re
In time you hear the word re-
That re-, that re-, that re-
You know you going back to some, you know

You remember? Hahah
That re-, that re-, that re-

[Verse 1]
Reinvent myself every time I come out
Reconciliation’s I’m on, no nothing bout
Reconsider violatin' me, I’ma crush you
Hey cross the line, you know it gonna be repercussions
I bought a red '69, I got her reconditioned
War busting out my hood, just for recognition
Back to the drawing board, let me reconvene
Better re cook it, no returns nigga once you cop it
Recount that captain, wash my hands soon as they free up
We cop some more, we cope some more, we call the re-up
Been get money all year, I had to recoup
I stay a year ahead of you, I had to re-coupe

[Hook 2]
That re, that re, that re
Yeah, we ride nigga

Oh yeah, by the way, I re-couped too
That re, that re, that re
Got me a new 2 seater
That re, that re, that re
Get your weight up nigga
That re, that re, that re

[Verse 2]
Relieved I got a little rest, I’m feeling recovered
I changed the guts in my rolls, I got em re-covered
Gotta keep a mean circle when you a skrud(?) dealer
Let me reiterate, recruited more killers
Did your recreation, with an honest went dumb
Going till they gone, watch them bitches recycle the ones
Havier on redial, I talk to him hey, even whenever I call him
Senior Rocko, what’s the reading
I say my friend I’ve been loyal, I need my price reduced
I feel I could be more productive with a price reduction
I’ve cut my old bitch off but now I’m reengaged
I had to bust at some busters but now I’m re-engaged

[Hook 3]
That re, that re, that re
Yeah, hear that
That re, that re, that re
We re-engaged nigga, heavenly reinforced
That re, that re, that re
Reloaded, rejuvenated
That re, that re, that re
Yeah, I'm really ready nigga, aha
That re, that re, that re
We up, right back in the reebok, lego
That re, that re, that re

[Verse 3]
Stand up, never lay down, I refuse
I smoked up all the gas earlier, but I refueled
Premium, per request, no regular
Real talk, don’t even try me bitch, I’m telling ya
'Fore I wait on anyone, I’ma go get it first
I spend my own, then I let the label reimburse
Run circles round these squares, relay
Go dj, keep my shit on replay
Plug to my circus how I stay relevant
I stay sucker free, I roll with my relatives
Point me where that money at, watch out as I retrieve it
Stop blowing up my phone, bitch you is not receiving

[Hook 4]
That re, that re, that re
Hey man you ain’t gotta be all on my line like that home
That re, that re, that re
You know what I mean? Real shit, you know
That re, that re, that re
I told y’all I’m gonna respect y’all when everything you know ready
That re, that re, that re
You know what I mean, That re, that re, that re
Yeah, wordplay…how I play nigga
That re, that re, that re
