These nigga don't like me, I don't know why
I can see you hate nigga, corner of my eye
I know that they plot, I can see it in they eye
But they got me fucked up, they must know about I
I, I, I'm a motherfucking vet, big homie
I'm the one that run the set

I'm the one they call it done
I, I, I

Already a star, fuck I need a feature for?
Already have hard, what the fuck I need a keeper for
I got several cars, on 3 piece swift
I got 7 cribs, I could be where I wanna live

I came from the gutter, I was raised up on butter
On toes I carry that toast while I was slanging that butter
For the most part of straight out, owe it all to my mother
Owe it all to my granny, granny was my daddy
I seen my daddy rarely, I don't let that shit determine me
I'm a motherfucking hustler, I live these streets they get me
I'm the answer, the question where that money
Go get a shovel, I done stacked a sack of money
Do you know how much cash I have sitting on
I don't either, I stopped counting that shit in 97
Think I had a million bars in 1997
Ain't gonn quit stacking this shit until I'm 97
