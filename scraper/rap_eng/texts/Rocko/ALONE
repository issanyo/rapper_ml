[Hook]
She want a nigga all alone now
Since she hear a nigga on his own now
She gone let me hit it to my song now
I used to want her hella bad
But I don’t now
These bitches ain’t getting no love now
Say she wanna fuck with a thug now
You ain’t never ever seen me with these hoes
Same ones saying they don’t want no scrubs now

[Verse]
Not too long ago
I used to blow up this bitch phone
Went to that open house
And was surrounded by white folk
Now I'm with this baddie
And this bitch won't leave me 'lone
I even stop texting her back
You better lose my number hoe
Why
Now a days V can't catch a break
Why
Hoes will eat a nigga like a steak
Why
Dodge a hoe they charge to my estate
Why
All these bitches trade clout for the cake
Now a days I don't see a bitch that I couldn't hit
Back then they didn't like me
Now a days I'm a walking lick take a look up at my fit
These niggas wanna fight me
Buck if you want lil nigga
We can shoot the ones
Took that piece pussy throw them bitches
What you shooting for
Mama said I ain't shit
Still shooting for the stars
Put the drugs in the bag
Stick a rapper for his bars
Sleazee blowing donkey farts
Pass him the gas sir
Its too smokey you can't see these
Hash slanging rappers
Spilling purple like the raptors
Hunnids blue like the panthers
Now a days Yeezy hit my line
When he want the answers

[Hook]
She want a nigga all alone now
Since she hear a nigga on his own now
She gone let me hit it to my song now
I used to want her hella bad
But I don’t now
These bitches ain’t getting no love now
Say she wanna fuck with a thug now
You ain’t never ever seen me with these hoes
Same ones saying they don’t want no scrubs now

[Verse 2]
