[Hook] 2x
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you, Don't you
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave me

[Intro]
Real spill though
You better not ever leave me
Shit from the soul

I called my momma told her (Don't you leave)
Told her pretty please (Don't you leave)
Had to hit my Brother (Don't you leave me)
Whatever you do (Don't you leave)
What would I do (Don't you leave)
You better not (Don't you leave me)
You better not leave me

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Dad left me out here
Mom locked up in there
Granddad left went up there, why he had to go?
Gone too fast, free my nigga Chad
Hit my bruh told him be safe, he all that I have
Remember Grandma found my stash (damn, my bad Granny)
She was like “damn boy, all this cash!” (she wasn't even mad!)
Believe me I need them, they need me
I feed them and they feed me
Real niggas only, they fake curve em to the left (to the left, to the left)
Get right by yourself (by my lonely)
Real is rare, family is few (I swear)
I can't take no more losses
Whatever you do please

[Hook] 2x
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you, Don't you
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave me

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Man I swear so much bullshit going on down here
I call my pilot, please get me the fuck from around here
My little partner like “all the cash you make, how you gonna leave?”
It ain't about what you make, it's what you leave with
Told them money, I'll never let you leave me
My nigga like “don't matter where we might go you better not ever ever leave me”
I be like nigga you better not leave me
What the fuck you mean? We a team
No I in us, no I in we
Moment of silence for Ma, she gone, she went home
She ain't leave until she saw me (that's deep)
She adore me (my grandma, grandma)
Why she had to leave
You better not ever leave me

[Hook] 2x
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you, Don't you
Don't you leave
Don't you leave
Don't you leave me
