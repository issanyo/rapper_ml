[Intro:]
[It’s gotta be in your genes
I’m not talking bout the jeans you got on you
I’m talking bout the genes you got in you
You won’ even understand
What’s happening]

[Verse 1:]
I take a trip to California
Gotta get the cash, the marijuana
Drop a couple off at Oklahoma
I get that pack back, we gon’ ball out here
Different things, same thing
I’m just tryna get the fortune I can’t have a friend
Oke up, looked at the man in the mirror
He told me  rock this son go make the change
Niggas talk that shit but they don’t want it
These pussy niggas don’t want to lie with me
Salute to my nigga or should I say my army
I got a whole world ready to ride with me
All I’m tryna do is stack cakey
If you don’t fuck with me then you ain’t shit to me
But if you fucks with me, I fucks with you
If you’s a real nigga you’s the shit to me
You know me

[Chorus:] [x2]
This shit gotta be in you, can’t be on you [x3]

[Verse 2:]
Same old thing ducking them snitches
Man we grind all day and night, fuck with the bitches
Gotta a house, only room I use is the kitchen
Full recipe know how to handle the dishes
Get a spot, funk it out 3 months flat
Then I get another spot right round the corner from that
Can I get another spot right round the corner from that
Don’t you tell me how to live
What the fuck you respect
TTG this shit don’t don’t stop
You know I got a lookout
They gon’ be out for the cops
Niggas hollering keep it cool
That’s the code we live by
What the hell is keep it cool
That mean the po po nigga
Niggas say they fuck with a man but I don’t care
You gotta keep your circle tight
You can’t be caught with no squares
In these streets it get hotter than a sauna
That’s why it gotta be in you, can’t be on you

[Chorus] [x2]
