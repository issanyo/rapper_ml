[Hook]
Black, put your muscle up x 8

[Verse 1]
Blow up on and pick that off
Drop it off and pick that off
Son as you pull on, might they pull it right back up
Ain’t pulling back, pickup truck
Better I’m flexing on and cashing out
All my shit is tighter in
Drop it until is seen
Make this shit look easy
Filthy your vein
I’m from the A. we’re not from selling B
You see that D. run upon their cash
Wide it more then we
Got my wade up on new suckers
Put it in their fade
I’m flex on, catch up
You think you steeling? Muscle up
I’m in New York
I wide on
We’ll piped up, we take up

[Verse 2]
Smash out in my muscle car
The strong way, old school come on with your new school (the long way)
It’s just what I do, I do my do
I work my move
Get my work like every day
Stronger nigga in my stake
Spend the ones, fine teens
20 stack on fifty on us just pick up on me you boss
Put your fucking muscle up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ah, stunting on ‘em
Stunting on ‘em
Hella bands in my pocket
Fronting on ‘em
Yeah in magic city getting silly flexing muscle on ‘em
I catch the barking up the tree
I got mazzle for ‘em
Quick, quick to blow a nigga
Oh, I keep to tripping on
Lois Vuitton, snake skin
I got the jungle on
Fly, 3 bitches at once I get my jungle on
But I only got 2 bust for all the jungle on
Flex like I’m in the gym
Doing sex
Flex like I’m in the yard
Doing rap
I’m flexing now
I’m flexing later
Put my muscles up on the swisher label
Like Sylvester Stallone when I flex with the dog
But only way I’m living is the way they shiving
It’s coming in and I can’t wait to get it
Gotta spend it now
Can’t get it with us

[Hook]
