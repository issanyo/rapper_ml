[Hook: Justine Suissa]
You and I
Truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I
Breaking ties
How could we be so right and so wrong

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Ey, we crossed paths
It's changed, I met her at the dentist
She a singer I tell her my goal up in the getter
She dig armanis she made a promise
To be the hop that could dare
I pay well dig that there
She gave me her word, I've gave her my bond
No matter what time I call she come
She ain't gotta ride she run (ah)
She wanna tie the knot, man she so spiritual
Free spirit, piece of paper, she ain't tryna hear it
How could I not, she sacrifice, she laid down on the table
Twice for a nigga, gave life for a nigga
How could I downplay that, I'm lying to myself
Saying I'mma do right but I'm only lying to myself
Some people say I'm cray, some say I'm dumb
So with that dilemma hard I'm numb
Maybe I was wrong, she deserved 50-50
I'm at the 40-40, hindsight 20-20
Go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Ey
Met her at the tongue and grew my homie J day
Saying 1, 2, J1 was the DJ
She barbie when she worked her move I snug her pinky heart
Cute face, nice body check her features out
I could feature her, she greeted me I greeted her
Arranged to meet with her she cool piece got my vote fo'
She voting for me, she with that campaign
Bought her a camera told her capture the campaign and
She flirt with me, I throw it right back at her, boomerang
We're meant to be, just so happen we do the thang
I let my douche down a lil when out the character
Normally be in and out but somehow I just let her cool it
Her conversation break me grooving
She come through, watch, move it
We ain't going full speed we just cruisin'
I let her know my dues and don't get what she's slippin' through (nah)
Damn babe, why the fuck you had to ruin it

[Hook]

[Outro: Rocko]
We had a good thing going
I was fooling myself
You know I'mma street-nigga
Can't get caught up
