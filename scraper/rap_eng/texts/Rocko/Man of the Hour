There’s only 15 minutes of fame, nigga
Man up!

I'm the man of the hour
Scrub no sour (scrub no sour)
Tall like them towers (tall like them towers)

Never too low (never too low)
Never too strong (never too strong)
Seem too strong (seem too strong)
He open up (he open up)

Take one craze in d crowd

[Chorus]
