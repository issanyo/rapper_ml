[Hook]
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, you are who you are
And when you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold as your heart, you as cold as your heart

[Verse 1]
I keep that same mentality when I was facing casualties
Goin’ through my tragedies, I practice like a athlete
Wouldn’t believe they had for me
Show and prove, don’t make believe
I’ll make you believe, all my thoughts free
Privet in a large coat
This ain’t no shit that I wrote
I’ve been down this road before
And I’ve been on the rollercoast’
So many ups and downs and turns
Homies droppin’ like flies
Full strapped forty times
Doin' a life sentence and he died
While I’m on the road, doin’ shows, takin’ this ride
I just got word my uncle tried commit suicide
This the second time I’m goin’ back in, the second time
You’ll get a second chance at livin’, nigga I ain’t lyin’

[Hook]
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

[Verse 2]
I gots the homies, they go hauntin’ me, the world too
And they ain’t comin’ back home, they in the cemetery (rest in peace)
I wish I made this up, it was a fairytale
I know the kingpin’s on, the name is Legendary
They smoke crack right now, this ain’t a Tyler Perry
This be a about real life, it’s very necessary
For me to go on in, so I went back in
Try to stay in this booth and never come out again
My lil’ cousin called everybody and he’s still fightin’
And I got killaz walkin’ me ‘broad, Future all they recitin’
And I can’t forget you made me be a too much bide
But I ain’t gon' hold no grudge, I just know your type

[Hook]
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart

[Verse 3]
I take a trip a rapper give, run up there like MX Miff
Go to New York with this girl and I come back with a lip
Break bread with my team
Partner money here her
And confidence, I want my music global
I’m gonna see who bump their fist
I’m gonna change a nigga life
So he ain’t gotta go through this
Don’t get caught in my fit
Till I’m runnin’ 1 0 6
They tracked me ‘cross the globe
You can have the fame
Just give me my soul
I could scratch these niggas and go back in that boat
Before I lose my respect
I stick to the code
I hold a tol on my shoulder
But I will never fall
No snitches allowed, case closed

[Hook]
And it’s a permanent scar, you can’t forget who you are
It don’t matter where you go, they say we are who we are
When you cook in the raw and you’re bad from the start
You as cold in your heart, you as cold as your heart
