Say it to my face ho, say it to my face
Say it to my face nigga, say it to my face
Say it to my face bitch, say it to my face
Say it to my face, say it to my face

[Verse 1]
These niggas thought [?] in me
But these niggas ain’t fooling me
I know for a fact these niggas be hating
These niggas ain’t cool to me
None of this shit here new to me
Pussy nigga better get used to me
Running the mouth off foolishly
It ain’t my fault nigga you a used to be
Better know I keep that tool with me
Even right now in the booth with me
Real street nigga from the spot
So you know the whole southwest [?] hoops with me
Y’all pussy niggas confusing me
Talking bout what you gone do to me
[?] to be hard when I’m in your front yard
Right now, bitch I bet you won’t prove to me

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
Yeah nigga, I was there nigga
I was hands on, you were nowhere near nigga
Throwing rocks and hide your hands old scary nigga
Quit living in fear nigga, [?] hundred in my ear nigga
All I stack is franks, split the rest up with my real niggas
Plus I got some little niggas, just in case you get ill nigga
Hood to me like bread, last of the real niggas
Want a nun, all a nun want [?], one of them niggas
Rap nigga, I kill you fore you play nigga
Real spell nigga, real deal nigga
I know what it is nigga
You wish that you could build nigga
But you can’t see a nigga
Yeah, you know who you is nigga
