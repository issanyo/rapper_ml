[Hook: Rocko]
They know my word is my bond
(poet poet poet poet)
So they listen to my poems
(poet poet poet poet)
This ain't no rep and they know it
(poet poet poet poet)
They calling me a poet
(poet poet poet poet)
And one saw me up if you can poet
The streets told me poet think if you
Can poet
Got lean on you, got lean on me, gone
Poet
This ain't no rap song, poet

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Bounce over in a beat, pogo
In my lolo, watching for the popo
Eat at Poppey, chicken for po-boy
Nice to them po-five, I'm no longer a
Po-boy
A Rolce Capolo I recorded on the rice
Pull the sausage, butterfly, twice as nice
Oh, Pokin' out, case I gotta poke it
Make you do the hokey pokey
Po you, po one, po two, po three
Po, fo' pro, pro jay, po jo, po me
You were thinking po me
I was thinking po you
Took yo whole po dub
Thruster, polka, switch the tempo
I'm all down the tempo
Everything in po is saying make me
Looking po-tent
Everything I blow is po-tent
Every shot candid, I never pose
Stick to the cold, yeah, like I'm poser
Free my niggas, let them go, fuck the
Posers
Drink the pain away, poet
Poet poet
They calling me a poet

[Hook: Rocko]

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Poet, poet, poet on the thick
Shit, ball it low, poet on a bitch
Sir Rocko, poet ova ice
Sir Rocko, poet ova ice
I remember I was Poe, P O E
Then I learned to cross my T, round it
Out
Spoken word, unplott
Only difference is unplugged
Word play, get them nouns a break
Get them verbs play
Turn that reefa a buff
Pronto on the lay, whatever you do, don't
Add a delay
Knee deep in the game, you wanna poe
You eat po
Look at me, stake my ears, poach
A trunk full of poetry
Cost my life mobilry
Burn rubber in that Porsche
Ain't gonna post her?
All the posers running from the po house
From the depth of my soul, my heart
Without?
Po out some liquor for yo niggas
Poet poet poet poet
They calling me a poet

[Hook: Rocko]
