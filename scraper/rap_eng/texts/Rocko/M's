[Verse 1]
Mind on the millie, money to Monday
Mosey around here acting monkey
What you missing counting money
I'm a mogul, V12 on my motor
Round with molly, finna go pick up Mona
She a model, if she wack
She couldn't ride in none of my autos
Different making model
Import em, mount em up, mix and match
My misses up, they both married
I'm mingling, I'm mean
Lots of money on me
It's mandatory it's mineral
For my mental was a misfit
Now I'm a millionaire what a miracle
Mob stop you the mumbling before I mug you, but not manually
My mans and them'll come murk you, fuck you mean man
Man power, marathons, run miles around you
Marijuana blow clouds around you
Buying mountains, building houses on them

[Hook]
Them M's, them M's
All I want is them M's
Them M's, them M's
You can keep them other letters, just give me them M's
The M's, the M's
Couple hundred dem, them M's
Juss give me the M's
I'll be good with them

[Verse 2]
Ain't no method in my madness, talking moola I need more
Ain't no mystery in my history, play with mine, you'll be in the morgue
Hop up out that machine thing with that machete leave you messy
Know you seen me in the magazine, but I'll leave that magazine empty
Do it by myself man, I don't fuck with them may pops
These niggas so questionable, I don't know though, they may pop
More spots than the measles, my pockets got more lumps then the mumps
More bucks than Milwaukee, even grind two hundred a month
On my way to Minneapolis, Memphis after that, got a sack to get
Fly to Miami, pick up some mail, down there they call me mail man
Money morning hop on the Boeing
Head it to the money, you know where I'm going
Talking G got plenty of them, nigga selling p's trying to get an M

[Hook]
