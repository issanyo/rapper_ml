Love it in Aruba, I love Dubai
I fell in love with planes, I love it in the sky
The ones the hardest to love, the ones that need it most
They show me love from coast to coast
Love how that money flow, look at that money flow
Look at that money grow love how that old money throw
When I'm loving this new money dough
I never seen a blue dollar before

(Verse)
Emotion of a strong affection, person attachment
Damn I never knew the definition
It's such a strong word, king of the state and more
You kidding me, you telling me
I don't love this it's chemistry
Got a shout out to my hood girl they never know
Double salute to them gangsters they show me love
I just replaced every girl no
I told you from the giddy up I'm never there no
Once that wrong broke that love gone
And love what those niggers shit dough
They might hang around gotta watch who you love
The love will let you down
State flow across the wall
Show your love take your fall

(Hook)
Hey worldwide coast to coast all the love I get off

When she kissing on my neck I fucking love that shit
They don't know what the freak this is ye I love that shit
Possible on the tour I fucking love that shit
Ain't no means she serve some cheese I love that shit
Love that shit, love
