[Intro]
Yeah, this for my motherfucking family
All over the globe, world wide
Real niggers, [?]
Just know it's us

[Hook]
This for my partners, my niggers
I swear to God I love y'all
Brother from another mother
Brothers from the same struggle
We get money, we fuck bitches
We do everything to get it
Different dad, different mother
Brothers from the same struggle
You my brudda, that's my brudda
You my brudda, you my brudda
That's my brudda
Different dad different mother
Brothers from the same struggle

[Verse 1]
Now we ain't siblings, but you my brother
Nigga play with you

My cousins were my brothers
My partners were my brothers
My brothers are my partners
Yo my mama mama

Different dads different mothers
Brothers from the same struggle

[Verse 1]
Brotherly love overrides all passion and destruct
[?], Say we fucks are destructing?
Cause I was at a point where I felt like erupting
Because I had nothing
Then bro set me down, he talk to me with some substance
He gave me the instructions
Now my life under construction
I reconstructed my life
And they listen to me at functions
That blunt love help me function
BLA so you thought this blunt was gonna be something
Or should I say dumping?
Cause I bang hard for my niggers like we in contest
