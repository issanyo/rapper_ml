Speaking: Rocko]
Aye, my name is Rocko, and I'm a addict
I'm addicted to money, I love fast cars
I love jewelry, I love pussy, but I don't love these women
I don't know what it is about me, I don't know
That's just somethin' that I just, I just can't do it
I just can't help it, know what I mean?
I refuse to be in a committed relationship
Because I just, I, I just don't like, I don't like that shit, know what I mean?
I'm sorry... I need help

[Verse 1]
Ayyyyeee
We ain't goin' steady, we just be fuckin' 'round
Yeah the sex great but damn babe we fuckin' 'round
Girl you got me hot, poppin' up at my spot
You out yo got damn mind, what the fuck is you thinkin' 'bout?
You've been misinformed, sorry if you read me wrong
I told you what you wanted to hear, sorry if I lead you on
Yeah that pussy good, girl I ain't gon' lie
But if you are lookin' for a dude, girl I ain't yo guy
I'm not gon' come over every day, I'm not gon' talk to you
On the phone all the time, you fuckin' stalker you
Look I ain't tryin' to be rude, but I ain't tryin' to eat your food
I'm gon' keep it funky with you, girl we ain't that cool

[Hook]
We just be coolin' it, we ain't goin' steady
Just hit my phone when you wanna play, girl you know I'm ready
We just be fuckin' 'round, girl you know better
You ain't my main squeeze, it ain't like we go together
You just my lil' buddy, we ain't goin' steady
Girl we just be fuckin', we ain't goin' steady
You just my fun girl, and me and you know better
We just be kickin' it, it ain't like we go together

[Verse 2]
I'll chill for a few; I'll stay for a second
Time is of the essence, no time like the present
Do a lil' spooin' or you could do a lil' jewel
We can make a movie, then I'm a keep it movin'
It ain't you baby it's me, me, me syndrome
After we get through just leave me alone
Aye, she textin' me like crazy, sendin' me them smiley faces
I'm yo Boyfriend #2, just here to pleasure you
I need a naughty girl, fun girl that like to play
A real party girl, just to cool it with
Whenever you ready to play just hit my phone, I'm ready
But don't be catchin' feelings baby, we ain't goin' steady

[Hook]
