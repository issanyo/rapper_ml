[Intro]
Uh, yeah, D-O-L-O, dolo
Lingo for solo nigga
Do this shit by myself bwoy

[Verse 1]
Dumb birds go dodo, worldwide go globo
Penthouse in Soho, I be a hoe less though hobo
West Coast going oh ho, in the town hall going slowmo
With yo hoe in your eye hole
Your wife, my hoe
Death to all my rivals, play with my dough go Pablo
Give a fuck about no 5 - O
Give you a two piece with a five -four
We survival, with my rifle wherever I go
Run insurance like Geico
Cross me, I go psycho, real life though
Pro charging that two door, that four door
See a logo on my shirt oh
No job, I got work though
On the Bayside go Prado, got a dunk off down in Capo
No rap group, only solo, call me I call dolo, yeah

[Hook]
(Dolo, dolo, dolo, dolo)
I do my dirt out by my dolo
(Dolo, dolo, dolo, dolo)
Right round who don’t worry bout dolo
(Dolo, dolo, dolo, dolo)
Play with me I pull a dolo
Yo, dolo, dolo
I do my dirt out by my dolo
(Dolo, dolo, dolo, dolo)
I do my dirt out by my dolo
(Dolo, dolo, dolo, dolo)
I don’t play no games I pull a dolo, aye

[Verse 2]
Rocko aka, Asimo
Aye they be trying to see more
I’m freeing clip, no PO, T-Shirt, T-Shirt for 3-O
On Cali-o like veto, gin then okay aye Rio
He hates it, like Sak pase, trilingual I speak creole
You chick ain’t fly like eagles, hold they asses from they zero
Your fishes more like Nemo, they say Rocko you my hero
Shouts out the single mothers, ain’t getting no kids oh she my Shero
Remember Ronald Reago, the heifer in my vehicle
Monster  like Soprano (Like Tony)
Monster like Montano (Like Tony)
Kool don’t play no shit though, gangster from the get go
Play with who that? Oh no homie don’t play that she bozo
No blow no blow there’s no go
