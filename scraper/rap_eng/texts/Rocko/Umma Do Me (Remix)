[Verse: Jeezy]
If you ain't talking 'bout money, you ain't talking bout shit
You wasn't on the waitin list, then you ain't riding in shit
And if your watch didn't cost a hundred, then you wasted your time
If you think you can do me, you out yo motherfucking mind
This nigga's insane, yeah, a straight fool
A half a million dollar car and somem house shoes
Call the dealerships, like y'all tricked me
Then why the hell you put my engine where my trunk be?
I'm throwing Franklins, I don't need 1's
Smoke a pound every week like I don't need lungs
Buy them wholesale and sale them retail
I'm talking seafood, yeah, fishscales
I said I'm so hot, but my house cool
So many rooms that it looks like a high school
Speaking of high school, I never passed that
Works right here, now where the cash at?

[Hook: Rocko]
You just do you, umma do me
Umma do me, umma do me
You just do you, umma do me
Umma do me, umma do me...
