[Intro]
I'mma ruffle some feathers with this shit here, mane
Ante up

[Verse 1]
Rich nigga shit, you out your league
Keep that broke shit over there, this nacho league
Poker face and molly mean
Seven liter, V12, this nacho speed
Fast lane, race you, beat you out your car
You ain't got no pink slip? That's nacho car
I'm caked up, I don't give no fuck
You can only cover me in your club, this nacho club
We own this bitch, this nacho shit
Plenty trips, make the cheddar, I'm on my nacho shit
Take money, I'm macho, ho
If I finesse you out your dough, that's nacho dough
You said that was yours, survey said, that's nachos
You said that you run the town, streets say, that's nachos

[Hook]
You say she your girl, she say she (nachos)

She's everybody girl, she ain't mine, she nachos
First come, first serve, count the nachos
Told you we ain't going steady, I'm nacho type
Babe, you looking for a dude, I'm still nacho guy
Yeah, I fucked her, please say that's nacho wife
Perpetrating a real nigga, boy, that's nacho life
Twin rugers on me now, I'm a hooligan
Walk up in the spot, they be like oh nachoo again
Yeah me, colossal dough
Nigga want beef, Frito Lay him, nacho dough
Favorite food is chicken, chop it cover the tacos

Yeah, no cromprende, oh you talking about that
Oh oh, that's nacho cheese, it's mines
Extra cheddar, preferably Dorito, big bag
