[Chorus]
You a sucka, you a lame [x5]
You a sucka, you a mo fucking lame
You a sucka, you a lame [3]
You a sucka, you a mo fucking lame nigga

[Verse 1:]
Yeah nigga saw you get succer punched
Them young niggas, they ate your lunch
That what you get for talking shit nigga
All that hating bout a bitch nigga
I heard you tricking out, I bust her in the house
I hit her in the car I hear you took her out
I put her in the club you went an took her out
I let her kiss on me you kiss her in her mouth
Soon as you go to work that’s when I come over
After, rup she goes to work she make me come over
Can’t lie I bought the girl a louis duffle, bag
Say bitch go fill it up with ruffle
Sharing is caring I stretch her out like rubber
Pardon me but can you pardon her why you cuff her
You can’t teach a old dog new tricks
But you can teach an old bitch how to trick a new trick

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
[Baby I love you] No way hosay!
Call em hosay believe whatever hoes say
Only fuck with a handful, if you a sucka ma hands full
I hang out at the bank tryna stay sucka free
You at the bank then you a sucka free
You a sucka, you a mo fucking lame
You a busta I ain’t even know you name call you sucka
[I call you charm] I see you checking out my rings and ropes
Dove in that pussy top ring rope, nature boy
You know them suckas hate you boy [fuck] , walk like a sucka
Talk like a sucka, 10 times outa 10 you a mo fucking sucka
You a sucka fo that bitch nigga
But she a sucka for some rich nigga

[Chorus]
