(Chorus)
I got some shit on my chest
I gotta get me check
I got some shit on my mind
I walk around with that fire
I gotta get it how i live

I got that hate in my heart
I got that tear in my eye
I got that smoke in my lungs
I got that liq on my tongue
I gotta get it how I live

(Verse 1; Scott Free)

I don’t give a fuck, nigga who nigga what
Might take a nigga for a pussy
Till i act savage and turn a wolf
Been moving like the squad low key
But now we gotta turn it up
When the young niggas call you OG
Then you going hard as fuck
Ain't nobody I’m dealing drugs too
My bruh died and my daddy too
The street gave me no direction
Except to these 100s and you know they all blue
Mama told me it was hopeless
Till I pulled up in another dope whip
Now the tables turned; I’m the dopest
And they praying for me like the pope is (huh)
Try not to end up a vic; squadin’ on licks with the stick
Hit then we bust down the bricks
Get rich and show love to the clique (I came up)
And this is the life that we live
Get money and spend it on gear
Come up and take care of your kids
Deliver this shit through the pen
We ducking and dodging the pen

(Chorus)

(Verse 2; Rocko)

Everyday run with the stick
Can’t wait to hit me a lick
Get a bag of that shit
Bury that do that again
Tryna turn crumbs to a brick
Gotta stick to the script
Break down sell it ounce
Work it and get that work out
Pull up, pull up
Everyday run around town
Gotta get all this weight off (don’t fuck around)
Ain't dropping the ball
Imma make sure it bounce
Hell in myself trynna please those around
One thing about circles
Gotta make sure its round
I said fuck them I left them
And then when I found
Only got one shot --gotta make sure it count
See we talking count
Limit recount, saving account, checking account
Every account, account, what a discount
Bulls eye, bulls eye, grew up in the dark
Gotta know how to swim
When you grown up with the sharks
Always had drive I ain't never in park
Got beef, I’m a biter
I ain't never gon’ bark
Im a big dog
Give a fuck about the cats
Niggas tellin’ on me I
Don’t give a fuck about these rats
Streets named me rock
Nigga I ain't no wrestler
Blowing on gas
Trappin’ out the tesla

(Chorus)

She say it ain't normal
I said it ain't supposed to be
Gotta go get it how I live
Cause it ain't nothing gon' come to me
And for me to live comfortably
The family and homies gots to eat
The journey ain't over — till its over
Even when I got no feet
Probably still pull my way up
Was a young nigga
Had to get my weight up
Stood up in the paint
Never layed up
Can’t sleep till all the bills payed up
This is my lifestyle
Money, cars, clothes, when the lights out
Been a badass, need a wipe down
Remember when they told me put the mic down
I go harder and harder
Cause the hustle addicting fulfilling your order
Drop it in let it boil up
Call me the messiah I’m walking on water
I got harder and harder
Cause the hustle addicting fulfilling your order
Drop it in let it boil up
Call me the messiah I’m walking on water

(Chorus)
