[Intro: Rocko]
Controlled substance
Why you call it controlled substance?

[Verse 1: Rocko]
I can't escape it, it's everywhere I'm at
Even if I walked away, I'll be running back
Hit after hit, I gave away, I drop street albums
I can't even call it mixtapes; too much substance
Dirty urine, yeah, I touched it
Had latex gloves, still I felt the need to be hands on
Guarantee I'mma make a profit off whatever I put my hands on
Street prophet, I just call it the way I see it
You saw it, I still see it
Big difference, ain't it?
Shine harder than the biggest star in the sky
Yeah, the Big Dipper, baby
Big tipper, baby, I ain't pay for it
I'm just paying for you to get the fuck on
Born lyricist, just true enough to do that shit
While you listening to my poems
I'm a poet; specialize in poetry
My voice emotional, make 'em say yes; flowetry
Rocko raw; he put the capital R in remix
Burke shirt, hat Herm√®s, pants P-R-P-S
Diamonds all V-V-S, shoes V-E-R-S-A-C-E
Giovanni, really getting money
Create revenue streams in my dream
Rewrite the business model
In my banwagon, E-Sixty-Three, Benz model
V-H-1 on my line heavy
I told them I'm ready, to be on TV
I said, let's get it; first let's talk logistics
Logistically speaking
I was just thinking how a young nigga can have such an old soul
Probably all that old gold
Posted by that pole; knuckles froze cold
Stuck to the plan; now all I rock is Rose gold
Forty-one millimeter president, you're talkin' the Roll
Hop up out the Rolls, give your bitch a rose
Lookin' like I'm all alone
But I got more guns than Roses got
More disciples than Moses got
They live through me, they love me, they need me
They see I'm the same way they perceive me, they believe me
Coulda gave you that watered down, but I don't fuck around
I'm authentic, I'm ambitious
Look for a fillet, and tryin' stick my fork in it
I'm in Miami, Florida, with my New York fitted
Concrete jungle mentality
Yeah, nigga, ain't no comin' after me
Duckin' parasites, I'm para-sailing in the sky
Cold heart cover my eyes
You can't see me, I'm in my disguise
I'm invisible, I'm invincible
I've been shot at, I've been ran over
Street cats still land on their feet first
Born and breached birth
Probably why I ain't jump out the Porsche
I lead in the streets, provided while
Probably why I'm a beast on the beat
It don't matter; I don't even care, just free my nigga Bear
Lord, bless me with a DeLorean
I wanna be a historian
Travel back in time, like Doc and Michael J. Fox
So I can free my nigga Jay Rock
Swear I could do that shit
Reunite with my constituents
We built a solid foundation
Can I make a wish?
Sister go to school for Cosmetology
Told her switch to Criminology
She got a free ride to get my niggas out
That tan sand got me with a sick pen
My shit drippin'
I know y'all don't need this much substance
I'm in this bitch trippin..

[Outro: Rocko]
My bad
I just felt like rhyming, you know what I'm saying?
Lot of people didn't know I could rhyme, know what I mean?
You think it's all swagger, and charisma, and flavor
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, it's A-One sauced up all day, you know
But it's bigger than that shit
You know what I mean?
I feel like Moses sometimes
You know what I'm saying?
Lot of people live through me
You know what I'm sayin'?
But if you listening
I feel like it should be against the law to be this raw
That's why I call this controlled substance..
