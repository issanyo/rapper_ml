[Verse 1 – Icewear Vezzo]
Watch glitter, my car sit up
No I don’t fuck with you op niggas
I’m a dime sipper, my charm bigger
You throw shots and I pop niggas
Don’t squash beef, we squash niggas
Send ho niggas to hospitals
Don’t spot work, got spots hitting
You got work, got compositions
Sell dope, that’s my decision
Cause I ain’t had no pot to piss in
G code, that’s my religion
Keep po' from my condition
41, just copped a Bentley
And this bitch ain’t talking ticket
First class, I got it mission
You can see the step when I got the ticket
Don’t roll Keisha, that’s [?]
On the war and that’s [?]
At the club like every night
I ain’t hiding, I’m everywhere
Ill nigga, I’m very rare
Real nigga, I’m very rare
East side, they scared of there
Bally's on, got erry' pair

[Hook – Icewear Vezzo]
Count money all day (x4)
Every time my line ring, it's 10-5, this the money phone (x2)
Bitch, I'm on my money phone (x2)
Every time my line ring, it's 10-5, this the money phone
Count money all day (x4)

[Verse 2 - Rocko]
Real nigga, know how to make that money
Never sell your soul tryna make that money
Drought call, you ain’t got no cash, got to take that money
Told my mama have faith, got to blow bigot
It don’t matter where I go, I bet that money with me
Keep my pockets like my guns, whole hundred with me
M O N E Y, I know my ABC’s
I’m so focused on that dope, I got ADD
Speaking ADD, at dat money
Multiply, make it triple, never subtract that money
Never let the money change me, I remain myself
I ain’t need no fucking change, money changes here

[Hook]

[Bridge: Icewear Vezzo]
Bitch, my mama ain't no ho, bitch, my daddy ain't no ho
Bitch, my brother ain't no ho, why you tryna play me like a ho?
Bitch, my mama ain't no ho, my daddy ain't no ho
My family ain't no hoes, quit tryna play me like a ho

[Hook]
