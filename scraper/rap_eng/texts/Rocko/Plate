[Intro]
On a plate, on a plate, you niggas on a plate
Y'all look like meat to me, you on a plate
On a plate, on a plate, you on a plate
Grab ya fork and spoon, homie through you on a plate

[Hook]
On a plate, on a plate
Better watch the things you do, make one wrong move, you on a plate
On a plate, on a plate, don't end up on a plate
'Fore you knew it, you was food, now look at you, you on a plate
On a plate, on a plate, on a plate, uh
Stick a fork in you, nigga you through, you on a plate
On a plate, on a plate, uh, put you on that plate
Better watch the way you move or you'll be food, you on that plate

[Verse 1]
Mikey fucked wit' Tommy, him and Tommy grow up boys
They been tight since elementary, even played wit' each other toys
Both they moms was single parents, neither one of 'em had a father
Growin' up in that ghetto, shit get tough, them times get hard
Playin' in they yard, they favorite game was Cops and Robbers
Fast forward, now they robbers, soon as they spotted, they goin' trodding
They pull him over for some jewels, they split 'em up, went on they way
Mike said he gon' lay low but Tommy paid, can't wait to play
Mike and Vince did blow, Tommy doin' bad, he ran through all of his cash
But Mikey up like "Fuck", he look out for him cause that's his bruh
But Tommy sour, he in power, Mikey love him, that's his dude
But Tommy grimey, Mike so blind, he don't know he food, shhhh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
There's a story about Vanessa, Vanessa was a finesser
She ain't got shit but everyday she play dress-up
And she go to the club lookin' for a nigga fuckin' a check up
Then she fuck on the bed and still was up on the dresser, whoa
Now she hot, she switch her spot, she go from Maine to Spain
Then one day she caught a lame and he made her his main
She think she so smart, she think she just gon' get his heart
And he, he just gon' buy her cars and jewels and chinchilla furs
But man, but lil' do she know that he, ain't yo' average joe
And he, run it just like her cause he, want it just like her
And then, she saw on TV it was a reward, she gon' turn him in
But that was the last we saw of her, last we heard of him (karma)
