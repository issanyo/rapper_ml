[Chorus:]
Ay what u put that on? (ma)
What u put that on? (dad)
What u put that on? (hustle)
What u put that on? (they head)
What u put that on? (that’s on the hood)
What u put that on? (I’m going hard)
What u put that on? (that on everything)
What u put that on? (that’s on God)
Ay what u put that on?
What u put that on? (Ay what u put that on?) [x7]

[Verse 1:]
Oh oh I took a dollar, put that on a nig (on a nig)
Did a triple up, put that on a ten (on a dime)
I was a millionaire before I turned twenty ( back and forth now I at twenty)
Man I put that on the hood (laughs)
God take that roll thing
I put that on the six (man six)
I took the roll call
Put that on for them b******
The A-T-L-A-N-T-A, I put it on for the city (into my town)
Really frighten me, N**** I run in
Ay ay, I put that on my life ( I’m the realest n**** doing this s***)
Uh, I put that on my stripes
I put two million in them walls, I put a nipple in the ground (ground)
Ask around the town n****
Tell you put it down (down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Ay its sacks dropping stacks, put them on my feet
Loaf walk with a limp (limp), talk like pimp
They put they ears to the streets
I put that soul on the beat
With my music they food, so I feed, I eat
Work, cook it
Put that on that water
Give me another year, that counts up
I put that on the water
I-I’m a junkie for that money, either way you put it (put it)
Matter where you put it (okay), anywhere you put it
I’m on my way
I-I put them bags on that greyhound (work)
I put it down on that playground (just playing)
I put them gunnas on, you play around (What’s up)
Dead meat either way you put it

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Oh
