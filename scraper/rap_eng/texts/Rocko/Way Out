Hey, born in the garden, now I leave way out
Had to get it how I live, I need it the way out
White people love me, they say that I'm way out
And these streets are one way in, and one way out
Wake up probably early, gonna keep my work out
Make sure my shit way in, make sure my shit way out
Daytime I stay in, night-time I while out
When I'm in your city, guarantee that big won't sell out
Bounce to the wall, guarantee that big won't back out
Bounce to the wall, never fall, never back out
Stack them hymns I stayed in a minute, but I won't back out
Pull that sack out, want me cash out!
I keep the money going in, get the money on the way out
Never mind me, I'm just trying to find a way out
And my house so far, and my car is far way out!
All the ladies love me, we're just trying to find a way out
Hey, money call, I'm on my way, don't give a damn is way out!
I don't care if it's out of town
Around the corner I'm on my way out
If he makes his way in, I'm a make sure find a way out
Bitches love me, they did my style
They say I'm way out!
Way out, way out, way out, way out
Way out, way out, way out, way out
Round, round with that clock out, boost phone, new blind out
C12, I'm a bail out, right at that, I burn out!
Any time I come out, you know bad bitch, they come out
So ice now I'm on fire
Now I can't lie, this shit is way out!
Knew she wasn't none but when she found, she turned out
R.O.C.K.O, we're done, one thing you gonna learn about
Face call that one, I pay in, I pay out
I do this shit day in, day out!
I swear I do!
Male boss money, all the words I never clock out
COD keep it like that, it was never stuck out
He hold a little key me, they trick me, I don't trick out
Stand all nigga, without even trying, I'm a stick out
I keep the money going in, get the money on the way out
Never mind me, I'm just trying to find a way out
And my house so far, and my car is far way out!
All the ladies love me, we're just trying to find a way out
Hey, money call, I'm on my way, don't give a damn is way out!
I don't care if it's out of town
Around the corner I'm on my way out
If he makes his way in, I'm a make sure find a way out
Bitches love me, they did my style
They say I'm way out!
Way out, way out, way out, way out
Way out, way out, way out, way out
