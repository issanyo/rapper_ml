[Verse 1:]
I seen a nigga pay his last for it
That p*ssy got a better record than Floyd
TKO, TKO p*ssy get the belt
Every time we f*ck I swear
It’s the best p*ssy I ever felt
How could a man’s best friend
Be his worst enemy
P*ssy still the problem
And still the remedy
Can’t live without it
Can’t live with it
No pun intended but f*ck it
I just live in it
That p*ssy got the best offence
So ain’t offended
That p*ssy got the best defense
So can’t defend it
For example, for instance
I fell asleep in that p*ssy
That p*ssy leave me defenseless yeah

[Chorus:]
P*ssy undefeated
You know that p*ssy undefeated
P*ssy undefeated man that p*ssy undefeated (p*ssy undefeated)
P*ssy undefeated man that p*ssy undefeated
P*ssy undefeated you know p*ssy undefeated (you know that p*ssy undefeated)
P*ssy undefeated man that p*ssy undefeated

[Verse 2:]
I get to drive in
Soon  as I drive in I blow her back out
She make me back out
She made me tap out soon as I beat
I guess she beat me
Now I’m sleeping, yeah knockout
Ready to clock out, but she want more work
Ain’t gon’ go out like that
Right back, right back, rematch
Then again, then again I’m a fan
Something bout that damn thing
She do her damn thing
WCW she the champion
Oh that p*ssy is so good
She keep that p*ssy soaked
That p*ssy ain’t no joke
That p*ssy ain’t for you, you broke
She know that p*ssy A1, that’s why she act conceited
That she ain’t fact she cheated
That p*ssy undefeated

[Chorus]
