(Hook)
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
I said you barely get any, whole team getting plenty

(Verse)
She’s staring at the car ’cause she ain’t seen many
Especially with a trap nigga in it
Might’ve seen 2 on the basketball player
Another one with a rap nigga in it
How many niggers go cold trip or quit the game
Just like that, ain’t look back
Maybe trans in the jump 10 toes in the rap
Now a million ain’t forever but the stories are trap
You live in a jet every day he travel
Got it out the mud till you made it on the gravel
Now the house got marbles , the state on acres
All the blessing that I gave him
We used to be a taker
Ain’t 2 minute that could pull up to the lot
How about louie down trash back full of gwap
Turn it down side up , inside out
Count it up cash out, everybody mash out

(Hook)
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
I said you barely get any, whole team getting plenty

(Verse)
Concrete under my feet
Hit face for trying to see what I can see
I get the mud on my face now the little she can see
There’s a doggy dog world what you kill what you eat
Always on go, never chemistry
You can sleep when you dead, you dead you can’t sleep
Quick flip everything, everything cheap
Saying close 10 days and I’m home in a week
In the game of the strong , move along if you’re weak
Once a nigga pimp and weep, you be gone in a week
Can’t swim no get in ’cause the shit get deep
It’s cold out here I’m only known to the heat
Ain’t too many that can kick it like me
Majorly living but I’m still in the pit
You can jump out over dollar trying to get to a pin ball
Hussle that nigga I’m out here getting plenty

(Hook)
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
Barely get any, whole team getting plenty
You barely get any ,whole team getting plenty
I said you barely get any, whole team getting plenty
