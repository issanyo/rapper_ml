[Intro: Bloody Jay]

BJ, A1
Since day 1

[Hook: Bloody Jay and Young Thug]

Smoke a blunt, re-cap before I go to sleep (Roll it up)
Think to myself, success is kind of bitter-sweet (Memorized)
All that jail time, and my niggas that's deceased
Think to myself, success is kind of bitter-sweet
Success (x3)
Success is kind of bitter-sweet
Success (x3)
Success is kind of bitter-sweet
Success (x3)
Success is kind of bitter-sweet
Success (x3)
Success is kind of bitter-sweet

[Verse one: Rocko]

People lose friends, people get hurt
Business is business, come with the turf
Wear your heart on your sleeve, got to put in that work
Leave some people back, they feelings get hurt
Fuck it, it is what it is
I'mma tattoo my tears, fuck no ain' crying
I'm in the air, I'm flying
They said I couldn't get in
I wasn't too street, now I'm too street
They can't get in, see that catch 22
Fuck you want me to do
I'd be damned if I don't, I'd be damned if I do
R.I.P to my people, bet you end the sequel
All that shit that we did, I'll never forget

[Verse two: Bloody Jay]

After that casket right there, a good time to catch your wind
It's just the beginning, we not near to the end
I already lost my brother and a close friend
Fuck friends, we was kings
Lookin' for a body doctor, fuck while we count our ends
Circle tight we can count our friends
Sacrifice that is, loyalty that is
And you know anybody get it
I mean you wasn't there when we did it
There's no explanation for snitches
How the fuck they know what you did, they wasn't there when you did it
