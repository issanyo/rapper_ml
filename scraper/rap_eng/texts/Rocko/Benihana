[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I had P's, I had keys and them shits don't open doors
Got a house full of tanned white girls, Jersey Shore
Got a thing for Ferraris, Lamboginis I adore
And I treat em like my bitches, in and out em like they whores
I say I love the way you grind but you shine even better
When I take the time to shine I’m on my grind even better
Got me hyped up in Valejo, they say they got that yayo
They say it’s weighin' up like a big bag of potatoes
Something 'bout them freak hoes, a song to my ego
Damn right I’m talkin' chips like a big bag of Doritos
Whip that pistol and that work all day, Three Amigos
What’s it take to brighten up your day? 30 kilos
You can send the clucker so you don’t know me sucka
I ain’t no Tiger Woods, I took them golf balls to Augusta
I hit the highway, Rush Hour, Chris Tucker
I'm ridin' dolo, Lethal Weapon, Danny Glover

[Hook: Jeezy]
I know it’s gotta make ya wonder, my chain lightning and thunder
10 years in the game, now I keep from going under
The money in my bag smell like blow and marijuana
I’ll whip it right here in yo face, Benihana
Whip it right here in yo face, Benihana
Don’t make me whip it right here in yo face, Benihana
Gotta make you wonder, keep him going under
I’ll whip it right here in yo face, Benihana
Yea, hah! Paula Deen, we in the kitchen nigga (kitchen nigga)
Hey! I’m at Gio’s cookin chicken nigga
Huh! Greg Maddux, yeah we pitchin' nigga
They call him Frank Lucas cause he snitchin' nigga

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Spot, doin numbers, got a valet car
Hour 30 minute wait, gotta stand at a bar
No shirt, iced out ho, Liberace
Stand up over the stove, cook it right in front you, Hibachi
Nigga try to repeat the recipe but they some shrimps
I'm a don, nun but lobster for the mobster
Fish fish fish, yo salmon want beef, nigga what’s happenin'?
Cook you well done, filet mignon
Scramble the eggs, chop the onions
Shit stink, baby say it smell like funions
Rocko the Chef, no Raekwon though
Karate chop that chicken… taekwondo

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Fire fire fire, killed him double life
Sea food combination, give me double rice
Poltergeist got your girl freakin' out
Put me on a box of Arm and Hammer, fuck a Wheaties box
City locked and I got my semi cocked
Pull up in that motherfucker with the titties out
Put me on the block, bet I’m sellin' out
Put me on a boat, yea I’m sailing out
Got my bank account hyperventilating
If I say fuck you that mean I’m penetrating
Real nigga shit, I represent the south side
I spell it with a F and the F stand for fire!
