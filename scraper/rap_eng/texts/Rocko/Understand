(Hook)
Already I be playing
You catch me down back
You build a doomer that’s your ass
Hope you understand
I hope you understand
I’m trying to help you understand
I’m tit for tat coming back
Nigga off for triple is success
The best reveal they see me winning
Know I kill ‘em
But I still don’t understand
Can you help me understand

(Verse 1)
I don’t understand what you saying
You throwing rock at of your hand
Lean around the bush I come cut down your land
Say it to my face nigga help me understand
You ain’t seen what I did ’cause you ain’t nothing like I am
And they say they look for me
But I’m right here I don’t see ‘em
I don’t hear ‘em everything I say I did ain’t been like him
With a sub won’t you at me
Meet my address I’ma text it
Better yet I think you flexing
Give me yours I’ma come address it
Get your one beats your ass
Hope you respect
If you don’t I got my troops on well protected
Give me the chess this ain’t checkers
Think you run a game I’ma play it
And it off nigga if you ain’t scared
You was in school I was in the street
Conquer my fears

(Hook)
Already I be playing
You catch me down back
You build a doomer that’s your ass
Hope you understand
I hope you understand
I’m trying to help you understand
I’m tit for tat coming back
Nigga off for triple is success
The best reveal they see me winning
Know I kill ‘em
But I still don’t understand
Can you help me understand

(Verse 2)
Going on a decade strong making money off these songs
I get residual income even when I’m off I’m on
Male boss money, male boss full of letters from my partners
In the can they got snitched on by their mess
Where’s the love all this fake out these hoes
Foolish mouth hate me but what for
I’m just trying to profit we the benefits our soul
Make some money of it
We live on the streets lend me your profit
Equal opportunity if I can then you can why you playin
Shit so puzzled lend to me
Wassup with all the fuckery
I don’t understand what you sayin
Come a little closer help me understand

(Hook)
Already I be playing
You catch me down back
You build a doomer that’s your ass
Hope you understand
I hope you understand
I’m trying to help you understand
I’m tit for tat coming back
Nigga off for triple is success
The best reveal they see me winning
Know I kill ‘em
But I still don’t understand
Can you help me understand

(Verse 3)
Ye ain’t from my hood so I spit you understand
What I did how I did it turned nothing to something
All I sense living through me living proof
If I can , you can
Write your plan, get your team together
Go buy a couple of fans, hit every city hit every coast, do the most
Hove over the land go all in gotta show ‘em you ain’t playing
I’m the hove over my land
I talk they listen
Some sab they teaching some sab you preaching
I said the same thing
By the way I do both of them
Equal opportunity millionaire for telling the truth
That’s some shit there, the street respect the real not the fake
That’s what you need to understand
Real niggers I know you understand me
Understand?

(Hook)
Already I be playing
You catch me down back
You build a doomer that’s your ass
Hope you understand
I hope you understand
I’m trying to help you understand
I’m tit for tat coming back
Nigga off for triple is success
The best reveal they see me winning
Know I kill ‘em
But I still don’t understand
Can you help me understand
