[Hook: Future]
Aye watch them watch how I dance
Watch it light up and gliss
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch wink and I kiss
Watch the movie, yo, homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'mma give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'mma give you somethin to look at
(watch this)

[Verse 1: Future]
Ya standin there just watchin I'mma give you somethin to look at
All these damn diamonds, man just mothafuckin look at
Keep that shit a milli
I'd be lyin if I ain't dilly
Them True Religion billings pop so many tags, it's silly
My dawg caught a 30 and they say he gonna appeal it
I'm blowin through the racks like a fan on the ceiling
She got that stupid brain, but my heart ain't got no feeling
I'm iced out forreal dawg, I'm pourin up trippin'
Slowin up my motions like my diamonds backwards flipping
My nigga rolling strong, we some mothafuckin hippies
Got a hundred thousand soldiers I ain't mothafuckin slippin'
I can wear my ice anywhere without no supervision

[Hook]
Aye watch them watch how I dance
Watch it light up and gliss
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, yo, homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'mma give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'mma give you somethin to look at
(watch this)

[Verse 2: Future]
Ima cold-hearted criminal, everythang flashin'
Young rich nigga, all my hoes gettin nasty
Booty shakin bitches love a nigga with Fantastic
See the money comin, I'mma flipp it like Gymnastic
10 band Jugg that ain't even worth my glasses
Moscato and Patron, Platinum dumpin out the ashes
Strong I'm ashin', designer I'm flashing
Fine baby mama, like Kourtney Kardashian
Scotty call my phone, I be pickin up laughin'
Saks Fifth shoppin', true story, I ain't braggin'
I'd like to thank my jeweler, all these bad bitches I'm baggin'
Check like mine, no talk, straight smashin'

[Hook]
Aye watch them watch how I dance
Watch me light up them list
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch it wink and it kiss
Watch the movie, yo, homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'mma give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'mma give you somethin to look at
(watch this)

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Everybody know my M.O., money long like Limo
Came in the game, I spend a mil, like muthafuck a demo
Aye watch this, aye watch me
Aye watch me wiggle this for'em
Aye watch me turn that one to two, then that two into four (work, work)
I need all the extra I can get
You smile, hold it, put it back together
Aye watch me remix this bitch
Aye watch me count a couple hundred
Watch me pick up da lot
Aye watch me pull dat Aston Martin out, like look what I bought
Aye watch how everybody watch me everytime that I talk
Aye watch me walk with my limp
Aye why you walk like that yo?
Aye watch me stand on the couch
Watch how they re-act when I throw this cash up in the air, while they re-enact me

[Hook]
Aye watch them watch how I dance
Watch it light up and gliss
Watch this chain how it shine
Watch wink and I kiss
Watch the movie, yo, homie I see you watchin this shit
Watch me walk in the club
Watch how crazy it get
Watch this, watch this
Aye watch this, aye watch this
Watch this, aye watch this
Man watch this, Man watch this
See you standin there just watchin, I'mma give you somethin to look at
Standin there just watchin I'mma give you somethin to look at
