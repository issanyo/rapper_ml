(Muhammad Ali)
Imma show you how great I am...

(Future Speaking)
This concert music...put your lighters up...and side to side...

(Chorus)
Let the music take you away from here (x4)
Let the music take you awayyyyy...
Let the music take you away from here (x4)

(Rocko verse)
I'm talking tremendous.. monstrous..
I swear this A1 movement is so humongous..
Aye future.. be honest...
We knew this shit was gone be big.. but dis shit here beyond us..
Remember it was just the two of us.. look who with us..
Of Course the crew of us...(Freebandz)
But now we got the whole U.S with us (everybody)..
Hold up its more of us (everybody)...
I'm talking exagus... young mogul nation...
Changed my name... To Don global...
Satisfied my fascination through my imagination...
Until it manifested... The best come invested..
Now I ride my space shuttle everyday.. hit the autopilot..
Programmed to get dat paper... I just autopilot...

(Chorus)
Let the music take you away from here (x4)
Let the music take you awayyyyyy...
Let the music take you away from here (x4)

(Future verse)
Freeband Gang....
Yeah...... Astronaut....
A.1.F.B.G....
You know the G it stands for global..
That money got me so geeked up... Feel like I'm overdosing...(turn up)
Every time I step inside that booth feel like exploding...(boom)
Ain't never experienced this type of high.. better than Rollin..(whoop 3x)
Every year we persevere.. we took the streets and made careers...
Every year we went so hard cause we was flyer than the lears...(straight up)
These niggas they can never compare... To the love that we share..
We should've been simese twins how we came up in here...(hard body)
Yeah... Bad to the bone... Closet full of skeletons...
I got a bad yellow bone but I ain't never home...(imma outta here)
I told'em Pluto all I got... And I'm in my zone...(space)
I'm Tryna change a nigga life on like every song....(future)

(Chorus)
Let the music take you away from here (x4)
Let the music take you awayyyy
Let the music take you away from here (x4)
Let the music take you awayyyy

(Bridge) Future
I'm flyer than avatar...its part of the repitiour...
We bigger than movie stars..we don't touch the ground no more...
Go high as we wanna go...take the streets international...
We did what we had to do...so we took a different avenue...
