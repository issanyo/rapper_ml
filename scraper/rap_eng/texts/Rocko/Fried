I don't mind riding back with it
It's food gotta eat
You at home on the sofa
You a couch potato
I'm at home over the stove
Yeah i'm there outta potatos
All the fumes got me geeked
So I put my weed in some tea and drink
I'm fried you can see it in my eyes
I'm fried ain't no way I can hide
Driving slow in the Rari [?]
Cause i'm fried
