[Verse 1: Future]
Livin in the streets, takin chances every day
Hittin up the spot, my dogs there every day
They locked him up, they give his ass 30 years straight
In 86, got 99 for that murder case
Keep that strap and that tooly, cause I know it ain't safe
Smokin on Cush, tryna make that pain go away
Throwin money, cause it can be seen falling from our face
You can see it, comin down my eye
So I had to let the money fly
Couldn’t see it comin down my eye, so I had to let the money cry

[Chorus: Tasha Catour]
This is the thug song, we had to do so wrong
We own a car up now, and it's a new day now
This the thug song, put your hands up
Put your hands up, yeah

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Trappin with the gang, runnin up that green
Where I don't pay gold, so you know I took a chance
I done stacked a couple Ms, but I lost a couple friends
But I don’t give a damb, that's why I'd do it all again
I done sold a couple drugs, finessed a couple plugs
Girl asked me if I care, I said I don't give a fuck
I done broke a couple rules, I done bust a couple tools
Ain't shit changed, now I'm grabbin jewels
Spendin cash on all the cars, I done fucked all the stars
Who'd thought a trap boy could make it this far
Put the hood on my back, the streets on my heart
Shout out to all my dogs, I do this shit for us

[Chorus: Tasha Catour]
This is the thug song, we had to do so wrong
We own a car up now, and it's a new day now
This the thug song, put your hands up
Put your hands up, yeah

[Verse 3: Future]
It’s just another of my dogs, on his way back home
We toast it up for my people that are dead and gone
I wish my nigga Loco was right here to hear my song
I got blood, sweat and tears inside my tone
Forever gang, to mention I’m proud
I give m money of a student with a college degree
I pop out, and it's like the water is starin at me
My life millions deep, you can never see me
I keep designers on my face, cause I stay as high as can be
I got some real bad nerves, and I still surve
We roll the dice and shake m up, let m go off the curbe

[Chorus: Tasha Catour]
This is the thug song, we had to do so wrong
We own a car up now, and it’s a new day now
This the thug song, put your hands up
Put your hands up, yeah
