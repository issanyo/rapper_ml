[Intro:]
[So now you acting all tough
I guess you a crook
But you ain’t even from the hood
So how you gon’ hold em
But you gangsta right?]

[Pre-Chorus:]
Nigga shot you, you ain’t shot back
Niggas slapped you, you ain’t clap back
I heard they jumped you, you ain’t jumped back
But you gangsta right? (yeah whatever nigga)
But yu gangsta right?

[Chorus:]
Lil Pablo put you on you Swiss
Talking bout hunnid bad bitches
They killed your main bitches
You talking shit but you ain’t sly
But you gansta right?
You is a gansta right?

[Verse 1:]
They gave Mitch’s dad a yeah
Was just screaming frill
SHove her on my bed at home
I feel like Al Capone
Whoa who’s the man
Free El Chapo goose man
Walking round like you the vino
But you ain’t got bino
Oh you a robber you John Dillinger
Well you tell me girl you rhyme with Derringer
No comparing here
One day you learn your listen
Lay acting all Jessie J
Wear your hat like Frank Costello
But you ain’t Morello
Ain’t no Soprano you ain’t Mozart either
Ain’t no boss is eager
Been taking losses you ain’t lucky neither
Talking bout the Luciano
These the gangstas I know
And all are dead or in the can
You ain’t no gansta man

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
So now you selling boy
You think you Frank Lucas
Yeah got caught with that boy
You snooze like Frank Lucas
Oh you make it boss
Oh you making coin
I guess you bad dawg
Now you mad dawg
A pretty boy Floyd
WHo you think you really, Lloyd?
Free King Larry
RIP to King Dave
Got two guns up
Now you think you Pistol Pete
This ain’t fucking movies
See they let you cue the cupid
Talking bout you run the city
I guess you Frank Nitti
Acting all desperado
See what they did to Pablo
So you say you gansta huh?
But these the ganstas I know
And all are dead or in the can
You ain’t no gansta man

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
