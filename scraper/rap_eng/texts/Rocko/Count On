(Hook)
Who could I count on could I count on
To be here for my fam
If everything didn’t go as planned
I’m just saying
Who could I count on could I count on
If I ain’t have a whole lot of dollars
Would I have a whole lot of partners
Who could I count on could I count on
If I wasn’t up like fun
If I was stuck down on my luck ,fucked up
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on on my bro
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on my mom
Who could I count on

(Verse)
I could count on one hand
I mean the people I trust
I need a thousand hands to count how many people I love
I can count on 2 hands the people who love me
Don’t get me wrong I appreciate everybody who showed me love
Can I count on a radio to play my records
Can I count on my lawyer to get my record disposed
Every day I’m up and edit like an addict so tragic so every day
I gotta edit , count it up
I keep my faith in God, so I don’t have no stress
That’s why I’m so blessed every day I count my blessings
Never compromise who I am I got integrity
No matter what if you my nigga you can count on me

(Hook)
Who could I count on could I count on
To be here for my fam
If everything didn’t go as planned
I’m just saying
Who could I count on could I count on
If I ain’t have a whole lot of dollars
Would I have a whole lot of partners
Who could I count on could I count on
If I wasn’t up like fun
If I was stuck down on my luck ,fucked up
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on on my bro
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on my mom
Who could I count on

(Verse)
If I had to go to war
How many my people gon be on go
Count on could I count on
If all the smoke lift
How many niggers gonna be right here
All the booty club money I throw it to the strippers
If I was broke could I count on them bitches
All the niggers I make sure I get money over the years
All the niggers I took care when they was doing gigs
I put my life into my music bro
Can I count on my fans to buy it out the store
They count on me and I count on them
I bring the prayers everyday ’cause you know I count on Him

(Hook)
Who could I count on could I count on
To be here for my fam
If everything didn’t go as planned
I’m just saying
Who could I count on could I count on
If I ain’t have a whole lot of dollars
Would I have a whole lot of partners
Who could I count on could I count on
If I wasn’t up like fun
If I was stuck down on my luck ,fucked up
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on on my bro
Who could I count on could I count on
I know I count on my mom
Who could I count on
