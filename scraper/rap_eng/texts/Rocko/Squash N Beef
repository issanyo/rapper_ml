[Intro]
Squash n beef na I ain't squashin beef
But I eat squash and beef ha ha (ima play with the words [?])
Squash n beef we ain't squashing beef
(but you niggas know what the fuck i'm talking about though)
Eat a nigga like squash and beef

[Hook]
Squash and beef nothing wrong with squash and beef
I eat squash and beef but I ain't squashing beef
Play for keeps a nigga crossing me
Ain't no [?] in that
Cause I don't be squashing beef
Squash n beef I eat squash n beef but I ain't squashin beef
We ain't squashin beef we just throwing them the queue
Eat that squash and beef let the burner cut
That's how you squash the beef nigga

[Verse 1]
In the biz I be Martin Luther King I be a busy bee
Two barns one stool one for here one to go
Gotta stay warm know the streets the code
Heater on I ain't freezing up
Keep that fire hot cook you on the spot
Talk like a ape but ain't gon bust a grap
I hear one more word ima send that herd
Talking beef I go cattle bitch I never lost a battle
Ever cross the merro merro
Squashing beef ain't on the platter

[Hook]
Squash and beef nothing wrong with squash and beef
I eat squash and beef but I ain't squashing beef
Play for keeps a nigga crossing me
Ain't no [?] in that
Cause I don't be squashing beef
Squash n beef I eat squash n beef but I ain't squashin beef
We ain't squashin beef we just throwing them the queue
Eat that squash and beef let the burner cut
That's how you squash the beef nigga

[Verse 2]
I don't eat squash less it come with the beef
But still the beef don't get squashed
Still I don't be squashing beef
So still someone gon get popped
Put that on ice let it cool right off
Let it sit up for a minute
Then come thaw you out
Primer cut Fillet Mignon
I can't grind no beef
That ain't what i'm on
They copping pleas waving white flags
White car ride by right fast
A thousand shells on the ground in and out hoe
Rocko cash cow grew up out dough

[Hook]
Squash and beef nothing wrong with squash and beef
I eat squash and beef but I ain't squashing beef
Play for keeps a nigga crossing me
Ain't no [?] in that
Cause I don't be squashing beef
Squash n beef I eat squash n beef but I ain't squashin beef
We ain't squashin beef we just throwing them the queue
Eat that squash and beef let the burner cut
That's how you squash the beef nigga
