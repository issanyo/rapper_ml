[Hook]
Pull a you on you, pull a you on you
Fuck around and have to pull a you on you
Pull a you on you, pull a you on you
Keep playing nigga, I’mma pull a you on you
Pull a you on you, pull a you on you
What goes around comes back around, I pull a you on you
Pull a you on you, pull a you on you
Don’t be mad when I pull a you on you
Pull a you on you

[Verse 1]
Fuck around and miss my call
I ain’t gonna answer your number at all
My little squeeze ain’t after her number
Wait ‘til I see your baby mama, I’mma fuck her in my Hummer
I remember you had it and you wasn’t even serving
Now nigga I got it, I ain’t gone serve you
They ain’t giving me none’ so I ain’t giving them shit
They was throwing them shots so we threw them back
Tried to fake to the left, so I went right
Now them niggas feel left, I done got right
When them [?] got a stick, I got one too
Niggas say fuck me, naw fuck you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you love em they gone fuck you
So I fuck em, make em love me
You treat me right, I’mma treat you lovely
If you do me bad, I’mma do you ugly
Tit for tat, simple as that
Step on my toe I’m at your motherfucking neck nigga
They pillow talking, they think I don’t know
Damn why Rocko acting so crazy and shit, I don’t know
They play stupid, I play dumb
I just pull strings, my nigga play the drums
I play fair, they cheated
Why join me, when you can beat it
