[Intro]
Love, love, love, love, L-U-V
Love don't love you, love don't love me (x2)

[Hook] (x2)
Love don't love you, love don't love me (x4)

[Verse 1]
How you do spell love? I can't spell it
"What do you buy love?" all the hitters say
Don't say you love me, 'less you really mean it
Cause I might do sum' crazy like start to believe it
Love the way you lie, make it feel so true
Love the way you lie down on that bed, ooh
Never leave the one you love for the one you like
Cause the one you like'll leave you for the one they love
You don't find love, you let it find you
Keep ya shades on and love'll blind you
Rather fuck the truth than to love a lie
Forever love the money and love'll never die

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, these niggas don't love you
They gon' hate on everything you do
These streets don't love you
They gon' take you away from those who do
I love me some me, I swear it's hard to love you
My heart froze cold!
First thing they holla "Where the love at?"
Well, where the love when I was doin' bad?
You say you love me, you better let me know
If you don't love me, you better let me go
Making love to you, best love I ever had
Why it feel so good but it hurt so bad?

[Hook]
