[Hook]
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared

[Verse 1]
I’m up on the top cause I took a flight
You still on the ground cause you scared of heights
While we’re on the ground, or we’re in the sky
Popping wheelies snicker
I heard you scared to ride
Never call my bluff ain’t gon’ never fall
This shit all or nothing no place else to go
I heard they cut you off, you ain’t got no strings
Thought you was a gangster, what’s with the hesitation
Got you diving headfirst, bitch you never play me
This shit in my genes, you can DNA me
This shit in my blood, running through my veins
That’s how I got my stripe, that’s how I got my right

[Hook]
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared

[Verse 2]
Aye, aye, aye
You didn’t pay that cost, how you gon’ be boss
Money changes self you scared too, go take a loss
I got all these banks from taking all them trucks
That’s why you gon’ lose, you don’t take no risk
Heart of a chief from the whole other brick
Always a go, nigga never been afraid
You scared you gon’ fail so you scared to try
If you ain’t gon’ live what’s the sense in being alive
Give a fuck bout what you think
Bitch your opinions stink
Ever see you face to face you probably pee your pants
You say I won’t I can’t, I say you crazy as hell
Why you hold your nest on me I know you scared I will

[Hook]
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
You scared, you scared
