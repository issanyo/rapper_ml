Wake up bright and early, put on my pants and grab my rocket
This shit cocked and loaded then I put it in my pocket
Plenty cash staked stuck it, leave it where I got it
Leave her how and then when I come back looking for my pockets
Look how big my pockets look, got your bitch in pocket, look
You bought her a pocket book, she bought me that pocket book
Purse first, yeah, my hoes in pocket
But I burst first if you ever get out the pocket
Yeah, my pockets look like books, Yale was my college

4 o'clock in the morning, we still up and fighting
Dizzy Bentley, rose, we don't drive no Maseratti
Brought your broad off in my party, got my rod off in her body
Got her face up in my picture, I got both your bitch here holing
I see your ho in Fiesto, you know what that bitch said to me
She said my nigga said he'll kill me if I fuck you
So I guess I have to hop off your truck you use to get laid
Ok, you don't give a fuck about him, I don't give a fuck about him
Honestly, I thought your nigga scared of me
But you ain't got a thousand bucks, I tell you what
You can close your mouth and let it free
Hey, my bitch too hood and my dick too good
Say my name, out your mouth, nigga, wish you would
I guess this is the academy, speak P.I.M.P. round the licks
She on her hands and knees on the counter piece
Only thing she got was a bag of weed
But see the aftercare before I air for that
So I just fire up the blunt and I had to ask, she said
