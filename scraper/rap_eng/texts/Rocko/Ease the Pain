[Verse 1:]
Numbing cream to ease the pain
But it make you feel worse when you finally feel it
Turn my white walls to wisdom
You cut me, I bleed green
No pain no gain
One thing you can’t hide is when you hurting inside
Behind every beautiful thing there’s some time of pain
Doesn’t matter my peers, over the years
I shed tears for all my niggas that died chasing the treasure
Who would’ve knew it was pain then the pleasure
Sometimes I laugh tryna bury the feeling
You my addiction, my prescription

[Chorus:]
How can I ease the pain
When I know you're coming back again
How can I ease the pain in my heart
How can I ease the pain

[Verse 2:]
Couple cuts and bruises, I played in the field
No rules, no harm, no foul
You gotta heal up right now
You gonna get hurt real bad
If you love real deep
Real niggas ain’t perfect but we worth it
Found myself some wet old dawg
And it cut lowkey getting sucked dawg
She put me to bed, I needed the rest
It’s gush yeah and that pain so hard
Oh my gosh, fuck I’mma do
Fuck gimme two
Take me away, take me away
Can’t feel my face, can’t feel my face
I’m tryna escape but I feel it everyday

[Chorus]
