[Hook]
You ain't getting money, get the fuck outta here
Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here
You ain't blowing kush, get the fuck outta here
Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here
You ain't a bad bitch, get the fuck outta here
Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here
You ain't spending cash, get the fuck outta here
Get the fuck outta here, get the fuck outta here

[Verse 1]
Saw you naked on your page you want a like
Then you wonder why a nigga don't want to wife you
Every time I see this nigga, you tell me to give him something
Nigga can't hear or something
You put on your pants just like me, we got the same 24 hours
You ran from it I ran to it, you ain't nothing but a coward
Get the fuck away from 'round here
Niggas stay the fuck away from 'round here
We run them outta here, like pussy get the fuck from up outta here
Remember as a little when I said one day I'mma get the fuck up
Outta here
Bitch I'm outta here
Talking add two never subtract minus that
[?] don't feed my family, all this money out here nigga damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Baby I can see your tracks
You gotta know I ain't going for shit like that
All my bitches bad
European, Italian, Stallion
I threw a couple dollars charity
I threw in the air she got it off the chair
Ya I'mma player
This a [?] game no room for squares
Hottest nigga you ever know fuego
Stacks, stacks, stacks, stacks and more
Spend it like I'm growing trees nothing but some lumber
Nothing but some paper, bitch I'm a blank check

[Hook]
