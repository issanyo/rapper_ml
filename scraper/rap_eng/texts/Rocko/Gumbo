[Hook]
Mix that flavor with that cash, this what you get, this what you get
On with three bitches, two of 'em mixed aye
All I wanted, drinkin' coffee, counting cream
It's that cash with that lean, it's that Tink theme
Gumbo Gumbo (Gumbo)
Whip it, whip it (Gumbo)
Gumbo (Gumbo, Gumbo)
Whip it, whip it (Gumbo)

[Verse 1: Stak5]
I'm C. Wallace, 2Pacalypse Now on every beat
Outlaw, above the rim, you feel my pain on every sheet
Listen, bitch, I got the juice
It ain't about bread, I'm out the loop
Sittin' at these stats, but I'm much taller hoppin' out the coupe
Real nigga, I can't speak it if it's not the truth
Fuck the differences, I'm real in and out the booth
Niggas change, same nigga with or without the loot
Stiff nigga like Ironman, just without the suit

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man I got platinum on with yellow gold
An old bitch, a young ho, light skin, dark skin
Mix 'em up, gumbo, yellow drink, purple drink
Kamikaze combo
Menagin' on that molly before I make it to the condo
Them bitch bust it open quick, fair and pronto
In the bed, giving head to the head honcho
Hunch no clock, what it grind, all I got
Get Glock, get guap, I'mma shine on top

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
This that gas with that lean
Add that water, make that cream
Put those stunners with them gunners
Gone together, that's my team
Add the molly, take them beans
Mix that soda with that cola
Break it down, serve a fiend
Run it up by any mean
Got a porter, we can end it
Like Rihanna, come on
I'mma put it in the twister
Sprung together, gumbo
It's that nigga with my plug
Broad day, I don't give no fuck
It's that money with the gangsta
You know that heffe? That's a thug

[Verse 4: Jeezy]
Betta show respect when you talk to a chef
If you want it done right, gotta whip it yoself
Fuck up out my kitchen, ain't needin' the help
And if the right get tagged, gotta whip with the left
Got my money shoes on, get some chicks in the whip
And hey, I'm tryba beat the best, so I'm chasin' myself
(I'm tryna beat the best, so I'm chasin' myself)
(I'm tryna beat the best, so I'm chasin' myself)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Stak5]
I'm on my paper chasing, I'm on high pursuit
Both of 'em scrubs, and I ain't neva wore a doctor suit
Operating on these beats like I'm a surgeon
Gucci got me fresh as fuck with no detergent
A bad here, a bad there, yeah I be splurgin'
Fast money, I need it quick, I want it urgent
Never had a 95 because it come slow
I'm eatin' good as blue crabs up in my gumbo

[Verse 6: ??]
Nevamind me, ain't tryna intervene
I'm just tryna mix that white with that water and that cream
Cook up all the chickens, eat up all the strip
Mix that fish with them bricks, Chriss Magetta is what you get
