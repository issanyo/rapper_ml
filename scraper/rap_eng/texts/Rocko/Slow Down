(Hook)
Full speed ahead I got my pillow to the ground
With my life so fast gonna be hard to slow me down
I can’t slow it down
It was slow dough then it speed up
I’m on the road doing shows
Travelling in and out of town
Tour busses , G4′s, gonna be hard to slow me down
I refuse to slow down
It was slow dough then it speed up

(Verse 1)
Money money come so fast
I don’t know if it’s gonna last
I should probably hit the bricks
But instead I hit the gas
First place motherfucker the last
It’s all about the win
Who gives a fuck who came close
Motherfuck the runner up
‘Cause where I’m from we don’t remember those
All I remember is the long nights
Trapping in that snow
I remember in the summer time I wear my winter cloak
All I remember
Shit, my brother called from the pen to take it slow
My mama praying, begging telling me let it go
My granny told me baby check on with the flow
My grandad told me it was slow dough then it speed up

(Hook)
Full speed ahead I got my pillow to the ground
With my life so fast gonna be hard to slow me down
I can’t slow it down
It was slow dough then it speed up
I’m on the road doing shows
Travelling in and out of town
Tour busses , G4′s, gonna be hard to slow me down
I refuse to slow down
It was slow dough then it speed up

(Verse 2)
Only thing I want slow is a hoe
I tell a bitch go get that cash flow
Still she got to get it fast though
Get that cash and go, that my motto
3 300 hundred K a building
Nigga that ain’t my auto
Too fast for the slow pole
Inspiration to the pole foes
They live through me they ride through me
I love you, I hope you know what you are to me
My artery, blood I bleed , the air I breathe
I feed the street, they help me eat
It’s my responsibility to keep ‘em much be
It was slow dough then it speed up

(Hook)
Full speed ahead I got my pillow to the ground
With my life so fast gonna be hard to slow me down
I can’t slow it down
It was slow dough then it speed up
I’m on the road doing shows
Travelling in and out of town
Tour busses , G4′s, gonna be hard to slow me down
I refuse to slow down
It was slow dough then it speed up

(Verse 3)
Drinking out the fifth, smoking out the pound
My doctor told me yesterday I need to slow it down
But this the only way I focus
Keep my pogo face on it
Like a nigga been playing poker
Tip all the new how
For my fair I pay cash
Moved in and right back out
Gotta make that back fast
Baby told me slow down but I can’t
This sucker want me to slow down but I ain’t
This the only life I know
I’m addicted to going fast
I’m allergic to going slow
Don’t get me wrong
Slow dough still better then no dough
It was slow dough then it speed up

(Hook)
Full speed ahead I got my pillow to the ground
With my life so fast gonna be hard to slow me down
I can’t slow it down
It was slow dough then it speed up
I’m on the road doing shows
Travelling in and out of town
Tour busses , G4′s, gonna be hard to slow me down
I refuse to slow down
It was slow dough then it speed up
