[Hook] (x2)
Stack that cash that's all I do
Stack that cash that's all I do
Stack that cash that's all I do
That's all I do, that's all I do
All I do, that's all I do
All I do, that's all I do

[Verse 1]
Riding around in them Euro cars
All I do is shit on niggas
All I hit is Euro broads
Give them that Rarri pass them to y'all
All I do is fucking shine
Gold on gold on gold on gold
Look at me that's all you see
Change my name to Mr. T
All I do is what I want
Give a fuck about what they feel
You don't fuck with me that's cool that's cool
Just keep that bullshit over there
B-L-O-W that's all I know
Dumb it down these niggas slow
Three plus one, two plus two
Rep that four everywhere I go

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Remember I ain't have a pot to piss in
Look at me bitch I'm the shit
All I do is grind grind grind
Only thing that be on my mind
All I do is chase that check
Nike boots, Nike sweats
Get that work out push that weight
Get that work off lose that weight
Add that up them twos and few
Stack that cash that's all I do
This ain't no law bitch I refuse
Win win win that's all I do
All I do is stay to myself
All my life I've been alone
All I know is work my move
All I do is work my phone
All I do is make these trips
All I do is make these flip
Stack that grip I pack them clip
Them niggas can't wait for you to slip
Riding around with strap on my lap
You want beef I cook you right
You failed to plan you planned to fail
All I do is stay prepared
