[Intro:]
Real Spill, gotta keep it real

[Pre-Chorus:]
Man you fuck with me like that
Give you the shirt off my back
My nigga where you at
Give you the shirt off my back
Don’t give a fuck bout none of that
Give you the shirt off my back
Shirt off my back

[Chorus:]

Give a fuck bout where they at
Give em the shirt off my back
Love is love and that is that
From the shirt off my back
I ain’t changing that for shit
I give the shirt off my back

[Verse 1:]
Cousin took them charges
I ain’t met no one realer
Fifteen, still in school, I’ll kill for that nigga
How I treat my cousin Andre
Got my dog them around
My nigga Tip by the way we found
Since I remember we been down
As my nigga Stacy would say
He looked out on a number
Lover lover I remember my first one from him
Keep it real as shit with my niggas
Can still interfere
So I can’t say they near
But I can tell em how I feel

[Bridge:]
The shirt off my back
Give a fuck where I’m at
I give you the shirt off my back
You ever had my back
I give you the shirt off my back
Give you the shirt off my back

[Pre-Chorus:]
Fuck with me like that
Give you the shirt off my back
My nigga where you at
Give you the shirt off my back
Don’t give a fuck bout none of that
Give you the shirt off my back
Shirt off my back
Give you the shirt off my back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My niggas over there in Honda and he licensed to kill
Play with me go bishty boy
Licensed to ill
Remember my license suspended
You came and got me in a Bentley
Took me straight to the studio
That was my first time you knew me
You knew that I was gonna fall in love
I love all the lights
You knew that I was gonna love
To hear my voice through that mic
And I’d be lying if I said that Bryan’ll play
Your role in this film
He introduced me to Godo
I take the shirt offa him
My cousin B told me to do it
I was fried like a fool
Fifteen, we was ten we was driving to school
West colt B5. I was standing the track
All my nigga hold me down, give you the shirt off my back

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hey you fuck with me like that
Give you the shirt off my back
Hey my nigga where you at
Give you the shirt off my back
I don’t give a fuck bout none of that
Give you the shirt off my back
Shirt off my back
Give you the shirt off my back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
It don’t matter what I did
My momma came bailed me out
Oh they say they want some property
Granny put up a house
It don’t matter the time of day
You always accept my call
Kudos to my niggas always accept my call
I was still a fucking baby
When you were born
Can’t see what I was doing
Cause I had me a son
I ain’t seen my pops in years
Ion know where the fuck he be at
All I know is I love him
I give the shirt off my back
Hold a grudge for nothing
All my niggas I love em
All my friends I miss em
All my fans wanna kiss em
If it weren’t for you in know where I’d be at
Honestly for that give you the shirt off my back

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hey you fuck with me like that
Give you the shirt off my back
My nigga where you at
Give you the shirt off my back
I don’t give a fuck bout none of that
Give you the shirt off my back
Shirt off my back
Give you the shirt off my back

[Chorus]
