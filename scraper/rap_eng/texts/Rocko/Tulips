[Hook]
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Aye it’s like roses are red
Violets are blue
Yeah better have them tulips for you
I like tulips for you
I buy them tulips for you

[Verse 1]
I’m talking bout them tulips under your nose
I’m talking bout them tulips under your clothes
I was staring, can’t say I wasn’t
I take them tulips I’ll need over a dozen
For her a MAC, she keeps her lipgloss intact
All her pants come from Saks but they look like they Gap
It’s like them tulips made of gold
Bring me more to help me think
I like them weasley cause they green
I like them tulips cause they pink
Aye she too real, too hot, too big
She too nice, too slick
Two minutes, too quick
She too hype, she too bad
I can’t wait to hit
I’m too sprung, bring her to me been waiting too long
Started at twosome, don’t need no threesome
Get two on, man down she wanted two - one, she too fun
Slept too good, I’m too hood, we too lit
I got two rows, better have your tulips

[Hook]
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Aye it’s like roses are red
Violets are blue
Yeah better have them tulips for you
I like tulips for you
I buy them tulips for you

[Verse 2]
Oh baby come kiss on me
Wherever you at, come put them tulips on me
I put that stick on her
I like that grip on her
Her pussy smell like tulips
They say the prettier the rose
But the sharper the thorns
She put that flower in her hair
Then she knows what she’s doing
I told her bring them tulips plant em on me
I let her garden my seeds
Now she smashing rose petals she bossy
Now she walk on rose petals, she glossy
That’s awesome, but all that I need
Is for you to leave and bring them tulips to me
Aye, aye, aye call me 2k, Tuesday
With the bouquet, but all I need is tulips
All eyes on you I’m talking tulips
She too lit, her tulips

[Hook]
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Tulips, tulips, tulips, tulips
Aye it’s like roses are red
Violets are blue
Yeah better have them tulips for you
I like tulips for you
I buy them tulips for you
