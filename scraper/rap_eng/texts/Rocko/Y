(Verse)
Some days I might just thug you
No matter how I fuck you
Wide 3 charge is stupid
Jar made jogging look cool
Porsche design for my beanie
Porsche cure my deedle
All day I dream about that sex
I still rock with Jesus
Go switch up on my rest
Snake skin about yourself
These nigga pray about being rich
Real niggas want wealth
Go get that sep out myself
Let TD burrow my jet
Slide on matter say he feel
Gon fall my bitch then I jet
I went from ass shit to classy
The camera ready I’m flashy
Jellan Fazy he laze me
Patrick Swayze they dancing
Chopping my biggie vibe
Got a passion for fashion
Then I have it I grab it
Got a passion for flashing

(Hook)
Hey all this money out here nigga why you bitching and shit
You been hussling for years why you ain’t get rich and shit
While your swag ain’t do the rule why you be playing the tone
Why your bitch be fucking me while you be laying it down
Why you acting like you got it when you know that you broke
Why you flexing like you gangsta then you know you the hoe
Why you always worry about me why you always around me
Why he do the shit I did ,why he look like that I live

(Verse)
Keep a style 4 hundred
Line up my clothes before I wear ‘em
I know backpack made for books
But my stack like book so I wear em
Better yet nigga I care ‘em
Gotta know know how to play ‘em
Jay had lungs with the major
Big coops to the player
Go to church in armani
People look at me funny
Guard say come as you are
I cannot help but get money
I can’t help I line my clothes
I work hard every day
Spare my cares away I
I just do me, you do you
Ey ran away from my shirt
Even my undie matching
All I ain’t late but chase no nigga
I just feelin low in fabrige
The way they all just tear for me
The way I look and they not me
From day you pee when you meet me
For then you see what you see

(Hook)
Hey all this money out here nigga why you bitching and shit
You been hussling for years why you ain’t get rich and shit
While your swag ain’t do the rule why you be playing the tone
Why your bitch be fucking me while you be laying it down
Why you acting like you got it when you know that you broke
Why you flexing like you gangsta then you know you the hoe
Why you always worry about me why you always around me
Why he do the shit I did ,why he look like that I live

(Verse)
Why we first at everything, ’cause we A1
We ain’t playing for anything, we get it day 1
All the boss are ripping torso
Extra chips, ruffers
Sometimes I wonder why I be stand up
‘Cause I send them prayers up
Sunday morning I pay my offering
Cali form for my offspring
And probably when I’m in that rolls royce thing
They be like Ro why you won’t retire
Why you won’t jay gold
I be like why? I’m on fire
Why reply,why ask why
Why not, bitch I’m hot
Why you got a maybach if you ain’t got no driver
Why you be doing that shit if you ain’t got

(Hook)
Hey all this money out here nigga why you bitching and shit
You been hussling for years why you ain’t get rich and shit
While your swag ain’t do the rule why you be playing the tone
Why your bitch be fucking me while you be laying it down
Why you acting like you got it when you know that you broke
Why you flexing like you gangsta nigga you know you the hoe
Why you always worry about me why you always around me
Why he do the shit I did ,why he look like that I live
