Maybe it's the way you look
Maybe it's yo midas touch
It's our chemistry
Maybe it's the way we fuck (oh no)
It's the way you smell
I really like that fragrance
Maybe it's the way you make me feel
I feel like taking it
Maybe it's your personality
I'm diggin your demeanor
Maybe it's yo nationality
Baby is you latino
You's a bad bitch if ever seen one
Maybe it's da way you strut yo stuff is what make you a diva
Normally I just hit and run
But maybe I shoud keep her
Maybe we should cruise da city
Maybe I should leave her (oh no)
Maybe I should take her with me really I dunno

On a way to end me, maybe they just won't my spot
They want a car like mine, maybe they just want my watch

Maybe once I got Right, them niggas felt Left!
Maybe I should grab that thang and kill all the confusion (bllaahhtt)

Maybe cuz I'm real nigga,that I'm so successful!
