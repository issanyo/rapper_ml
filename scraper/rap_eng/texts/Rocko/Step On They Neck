[Hook]
I'mma step on they neck ain't gon' give them no breath
I'mma smash on they ass make they give me respect
I'mma step on they neck them suckas hate me to death
But the street niggas love me you know I love them to death
Keep my foot on they neck look at all this ice on my neck
They bitch be giving me neck I keep my foot on they neck
I'mma step on they, I'mma step on they neck

[Verse 1]
It's just me aye, what can I say
I'mma [?] I won't play no other way
Step on my toes I'mma kick you in your face
Gangster shit that's the only way we play
Watch your mouth ya better watch what you say ya
Exterminators with me they can't wait to spray ya
They throwing low blow below the belt
But I'mma take the ass away I'm at they neck

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let up on these suckas, spare these motherfuckas
I'm independent rich if they don't like me fuck 'em
[?] by my belt buckle
Parachute can't find it
D-color diamonds, VVS the finest
Why these niggas playing you know me you know I can
Pull up on you with your girl pull up off you with your girl
[?] what they say nigga that's my word
Name one nigga that do what I do
I'm one of one these niggas fool
Really [?] from the town
Sold that white I sold that brown
Took that work I broke it down
Lost that weight I sold them pounds
Everybody around me don't fuck around
Everyone say they want that million know me nigga I put it down
Came from the bottom I'm on top now

[Hook]
