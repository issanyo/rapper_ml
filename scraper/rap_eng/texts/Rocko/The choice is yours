Chorus:
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
But I chose to be out here with my kids
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
Gimmie some of this legitimate money , man!
The choice is yours
You know what I mean, and the choices i made
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
What choice you gonna make, nigga?

Why be bush? You can be a tree
Why be broke? you can be like me
Why be fish, nigga? You can be a shark
Why not be the wildest in the sea!
Why be a bike? You can be a car
Why be a cloud? You can be a star
If you ganna be a snake, be an anaconda
Be a king Cobra, go and take it over
I’m just putting something on your mind
You choose, not listening, that’s cool, that’s fine
Why not maximize on your time
That shit, just to waste your grind
Why be a cat, nigga you ain't no lion
All that flexing, all that lying
You can be a.. why settle for a …
You can be a big dog why the fuck you a pup
Fuck that shit, turn it up a little more
Go ahead be a wolf, might as well just do it
Bigger the risk, bigger the reward
Never dont know if you dont go for it
You can get rich, you can stay broke
It ain’t mybusiness nigga that’s your choice
You can get rich, you can stay poor
Moral of the story, the choice is yours!
Hey, hey, I had no choice I will…

Chorus:
The choice is yours
But now I can chose, you know
The choice is yours
I chose to get this money on everything
The choice is yours
I wake up…
The choice is yours
Rise and …
The choice is yours
What you gonna do?
Barbecue, or mildew?
The choice is yours
You know what I’m saying?
We gonna stay broke!
The choice is yours
Go get some of this cash, nigga!
That’s right!
The choice is yours

Hey, I know my rights
I got the right to be up high
We got up, we get it
We under dig it!
It’s the life I chose so I know what come with it
Cherish every minute
The time ticking, in a second this could end
Every day I buy a new time piece
Fuck a time piece
Life is shorter, all I fuck is quarters
Playing soccer across the water
I still kicking, shit, money ain’t doing me!
I’m still getting it, you’re scared of money, nigga?
Shit! You got the right to be a coward
Or you can be a fucking…
… you ride American, I’m European
You gotta make the try, you could lose or you could win!

Chorus:
You stay round…
The choice is yours
You can ride an European car
The choice is yours
You can say fuck, it’s just the way you are
The choice is yours
I’s your life, you gotta make the choice
The choice is yours
You can stay out here broke, wishing niggers
The choice is yours
Or you can get out your ass and make some billions!
The choice is yours
Or you can go broke tricking on your bitches
The choice is yours
It’ your life, you gotta make a decision!
The choice is yours!
