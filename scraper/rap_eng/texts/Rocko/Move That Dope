[Verse 1]
Let the hecklers heckle
I am still puttin' up shots like the Heckle and Koch
I won't set foot in the box
I am the chef on the double shift
I just be cooking a lot
I got a zip and its rar
That should be cookin' the pot, cookin' the pot, cookin' it

[Hook] (x2)
Young nigga roll that joint
Young nigga roll that joint and roll that joint and roll that joint
Young nigga roll that joint

[Verse 2]
Praise God
He taught us his breathing
Don't fall off your high horse ain't Christopher Reevin'
Ain't nobody grieving, nobody missing
Married the game but she nobody misses
Can't blame the guns why don't nobody miss
Bring back my niggas now nobody missed
Back to the subject your body miss is like nobody maybe you Godbody
Tell me are you Artemis or you are remissed
Don't sell yourself short cause you are the shit a true art cause you are legit
Nonstop see me all seasons
Of that plane movie
I'm like Liam Neeson
Bitch I don't need no reason between me and you
It's all for the taking you workin'
Naw you just working on bitches that fake like they ain't
But they all for the taking too
My last shit's dope and my drop finna kill more niggas like Taken 2
I've been making moves what the fuck you doing
You line up for sneakers they line up for me
Get your head up straight boy your lineup funny
