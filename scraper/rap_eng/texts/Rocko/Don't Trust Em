[Intro:]
Shit, all the shit done got myself into
Can’t even trust me, how I’mma trust you

[Chorus:]
I don’t trust em (don’t trust these bitches)
I don’t trust em (can’t trust these niggas)
I don’t trust em (don’t trust these niggas)
I don’t trust em (don’t trust these bitches
You can’ trust em (don’t trust these bitches)
Don’t trust em (can’t trust these niggas))
I don’t trust em (don’t trust these niggas)
I don’t trust em (don’t trust these bitches

[Verse 1:]
Fuck around with these niggas thought I could trust em
Fuck around with these bitches thought I could trust em
But these niggas can’t get trusted
And these niggas worse than them
Hey he met her in my 8
She look something like MIA
Let her get a DOA
Up on the stage yeah I remember
It was the middle of November
Cause we just had got that Rover
Lebron had talked her out the club
She say she coming over
She let them put that dick in her
He thought she was digging them
Fuck them good, he fell asleep
He be snoring while she getting them
Wake up notice shit is gone
Round her up, she igging them
Though she fuck with you
That’s why I got trust issues

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Fucking round with them niggas
Thought I could trust em
Fucking round with them bitches
Thought I could trust em
But these bitches can’t be trusted, nada
You know these niggas worse than them
I was being generous
I passed the cup a lot of slim
Toast then gon’ hit her A with one
Then take the other bih
See all I’m tryna do is put my DMB discreet
I keep that A-1 you can’t beat that shit
Be jumping cross the street
I got a lil spot called the street
I took all very lowkey
To the point I pull her to the garage
Don’t even need no key
Okay this nigga ride with me
Only nigga know I be
Conveniently my spot get hit
My door get kick
Ain’t that some shit

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro:]
Fuck around with these niggas thought I could trust em
Fuck around with these bitches thought I could trust em
But these niggas can’t get trusted
And these niggas worse than them
