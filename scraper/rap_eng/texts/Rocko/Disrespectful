[Hook]
I'm so disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, I'm so disrespectful

[Verse 1]
Riding half a million dollar cars on them pussies
Their main thing shotgun can't wait to give me that pussy
Quarter million on my neck I'm like fuck it
Been waiting to drop a bag on you bitch touch it
Excuse me I'm pissing fuck you I'm shitting
On any nigga that ain't with us get him
Sike 'em my dawgs can't wait to eat
We don't fuck with [?] we can't wait to beef
Duck chickens trying to make some bread
Clean them collard greens feed that rabbit food
If its ugly serve them diamonds
Lingo for diamonds

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2]
I'll take your number won't even call you
If you let me fuck today forget tomorrow
You say I fucked you baby, she acting fraudulent
I'm by myself he with his crew, fuck all of you
Young wild niggas in [?]
Bitch I sell a fuck before I give one
Motherfuck the cash I'm trying to make some
Bitch you better feed me before I take something
Streets showing love cause he fuck with 'em
Them suckas hate his guts he don't fuck with 'em
Man fuck niggas, bitch you stuck with me
Bitch I'll tell your momma you is a fuck nigga
