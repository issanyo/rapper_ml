Verse 1:
You’d rather take your house and make it out a trap (out a trap)
Whatever just to make me happy
And now a days I could easily say
I apologize for treating you so badly (sorry)
It felt like you just threw me away (what)
14 let em come take me away (yeah)
But you ain't raise me to hold no grudge
So it is what it it is , cuz it was what it was
You wanted me to be better than my daddy (my daddy)
I ain't seen him in so long
But I love, the love, I get from my kids (when)
Every single night, when I get home
Tough love(tough love) I like that (I like that)
Thanks to you, Im back on track
And I ain't too gangsta to tell you this (What)
Mama, you know I love you for that

Verse 2:
They say the going get tough
Then the tough get going
(But what you do)But you stood 10 tall, not even knowing
None of us knew the outcome was gonna be
(What we knew)All we knew was they accusing me of selling the G’s
They had in the can, Baby you never missed a court date(never)
Every single visit in there, you there to support me
And when I came home, I ain't have to leave, You made sure I had everything that I need
I took a L with the sack, You let me bounce back
(aye what she is) Shes a definite blessing, I gotta count that (thank you)
Friends told you that I was bad news, Ran with a bad crew, said Ima bad dude
(what you do)And over them you chose Rock, so no matter what I got, you got
(what you say)Over them you chose a thug, so its only right for me to show you some love

Verse 3:
I still got all the clothes you made for me
And everything you taught me always stayed with me
You was always at church, while I stayed in the streets
I think the only reason Im here is cuz you prayed for me
You showed me right from wrong , taught me bout the power of tongue
That’s why I keep it real no matter what, in all of my songs
Found them guns in your house, you coulda put me out
But you didn’t cuz you knew what thug life was about
So you kept me in your prayers kept on giving me hugs
Kept on telling its more than life to selling these drugs
You know you hate the simple fact your grandbabys a thug
But no matter what I did, you still gave me your love

Chorus:
I say a thug needs love too (thugs need love too)
I say a thuuggg neeeedsss..
I say a thug needs love too
Even a thuuggg neeeedsss love ....
I say a thug needs love too
I say a thuuggg neeeedsss..
I say a thug needs love too
Even a thuuggg neeeedsss love ....
