[Intro:]
Ay she freaky
She she she freaky
She freaky
Ay she freaky

[Chorus:]
She a freak i'm a freak ay she freaky
Hold up freaky ass look at her freaky self
Look at her freaky ass look at her lil freaky self
Love to watch her shake her ass with her lil freaky self
Look at her bounce that ass with her lil freaky self
She make me curl ma toes with her lil freaky self
No she ain't a hoe she just a freaky girl
She my lil freaky freak she freak me anywhere
She don't freaking care with her lil freaky self

[Verse 1:]
Top down, hair blowing [where you going] down south
She from up north I keep her down south
She a rider she ain't just a passenger she gon ride out
Giddee up horse power she gon ride out
[freaky] her ass so small her her hair so long I like to grab it all
She talk so soft, I love to hear her voice
Her lips so soft and moist she share it at nights
I put her to bed nyquil
Her nigga ain't hitting it right she know that I will
She freaky just like me we freak on top of the sheet
She far from being a hoe but she sure a freak

[Chorus:]
Ay hold up freaky ass look at her freaky self
Look at her freaky ass look at her lil freaky self
Love to watch her shake her ass with her lil freaky self
Look at her bounce that ass with her lil freaky self
She make me curl ma toes with her lil freaky self
No she ain't a hoe she just a freaky girl
She my lil freaky freak she freak me anywhere
She don't freaking care with her lil freaky self

[Verse 2:]
Her name is dominique say she 21
And she super freak and she types of fun
See her sometimes but we barely speak
I let her take control, she a control freak
Lady in the streets she gets freaking private
Sometimes in public she asks to see my private
That's only when she get up on that cyrus
I never judged her I never passed the bar
Sex so easy to have love so hard to find
A freak so easy to see even though love is blind
She a free spirit she don't freaking care
No she ain't a hoe just a freaky girl

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I got that pussy farting this shit so good
Wetter than a river water  I love that pussy
I'm on my way to get her fuck where she is
I can't wait to hit her I prefer the back

[Chorus]
