[Intro]
Hi, yeah bi, bi

[Hook]
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi

[Verse 1]
Text my phone get no reply
All she get is hi and bi, high as the sky
My bitch bi, her partner straight I told that bitch bi
Never mine me, I’m high, twice as high
Selling if you want to buy
Abu Dhabi high why
The man that supply
I give ‘em death dumps and high five’s
They say Rock when your album drop we wanna buy
Love for life, I see you later, I never say goodbye
Woke up in NY, stop in MI just to say hi
In and out, on the chow, fly and land
Fly right out

[Hook]
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi

[Verse 2]
Slide through that, two
Pull that two third
Sign and out, a river moves
Couple yachts, Lambo thots
High rolling, buy clothes
War shows, ladies know
Hold on now, come and go
Pick up more mail, fair play
Serving dudes bring the piece in
Boost up tell them peace out
Go get some more in, some more out
Waikiki Beach, aloha
Mountain top, that highland
Not even byland
Now we sky high
I told both of them bi

[Hook]
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
Hi bi, hi bi, hi bi, hi bi
