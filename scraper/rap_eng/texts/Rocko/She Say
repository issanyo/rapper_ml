[Hook]
She say she don't mess with thugs
She say she don't do drugs
She say she don't do girls
I won't believe nothing she say
She say she don't need no man
She say she got them bands
I say she with the shit
I won't believe shit she saying

[Verse 1]
She say she never rolled in a mansion
I said its room for expansion
Multiplication, addition, let's add a couple bitches
She say she ain't 'bout it I say she a liar
You no longer desire she say she want to try
She say she a boss, she say she handle biz
She say her ass real, I say she telling fibs
Who she think I am
She say I'm the dumb nigga I know all your jams
You the realest nigga breathing you the realest nigga living
Always tell it how you live it and you take care of your children
And what she say, that's what she said
Said its a blessing to stand here next to me
She said she good girl she go to school
She said she smart girl she work her moves
She said she live alone, she said she don't talk on phone
She said she do the texting she say she do the sexing
[?] nigga call the quits
She say I'm her match to strike back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She say she don't do drugs, she say she don't do thugs
She say she don't do girls until she started fucking with us
She say Rocko you a dog
I said girl please you don't listen to that he say she say
Give a fuck about what they say, fuck what she say, hear what she say
Rocko you a fool with it, I just know what to do with it
She say she get moist at the sound of my voice and them other rappers trash, told me I'mma choice
I say she will, she say she won't
I say she do, she say she don't
I just say ok, what ever you say
She say she a Virgo she say she a virgin
I say I'm a burglar I'mma break you in
She say she ready, she want to fuck me
I'm her mce she say she love me
She say I'm the flyest, I say I can't deny it
She say she usually don't do this, I say she lying

[Hook]
