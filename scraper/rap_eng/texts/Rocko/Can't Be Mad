[Intro:]
I know I ain’t perfect so I can’t be mad
You ain’t either so you can’t be mad
Real Spill

[Pre-Chous:]
You can’t be mad at me, I can’t be mad at you [x4]

[Chorus:]
You can’t be mad at me (you can’t be mad)
I can’t be mad at you (I can’t be mad)
You can’t be mad at me (you can’t be mad)
I can’t be mad at you (I can’t be mad)
You can’t be mad at me (I can’t be mad)
I can’t be mad at you (I can’t be mad)
You can’t be mad at me (you can’t be mad)
I can’t be mad at you (I can’t be mad)

[Verse 1:]
You and mom ya’ll didn’t work out
But it was cool cause it worked out
I can count on one hand the times I saw you
Yeah I got your calls but I ignored you
Maybe it was cause I was feeling a way
I was caught between and feeling a way
Then we talked like everything okay
It ain’t your fault is what I knew you would say
But I go so hard to be a father to mine
Talking fulltime, not just part of the time
Now you understand why I don’t fuck with you
But you can’t choose family
They stuck with you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
You and me ain’t getting along
But it’s all G cause we grown
Sometimes I wonder, the fuck’s going on
Say he spoke to you and you spoke to me and so long
To be honest I don’t even know what’s so wrong
We was friends for so long then we said our so longs
It ain’t bout who right or who wrong
I say let bygones be gone
And since we don’t talk through the telephone
I’m telling you through the microphone
You’ll always be my brother
Hell we both blessed each other
Still cool with all the same people that helped each other
Even though I don’t really understand what’s up with you
Nigga I’m your fam so I ain’t mad
I still fuck with you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
