[Hook]
Imma protect her, fight for her, kill for her, fast
If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be having all this cash
From the first time I saw her it was something bout her I know she was worth
I feel in love with her
Her

[Verse 1]
Damn what the hell I'm I going to do with her
I swear I need to be through with her
I should be at the studio at work
But instead I'm in the streets with her
Wow I'm in denial
I love her style we walk that aisle
I remember she was a baby a child
I stayed down she made it worth my while
She my favorite she made me rich
All the DBoys they love my bitch
Nah I ain't sick of her
But I'm still trying to get rid of her

[Hook]
Imma protect her, fight for her, kill for her, fast
If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be having all this cash
From the first time I saw her it was something bout her I know she was worth
I feel in love with her
Her

[Verse 2]
She so pretty everybody want her
Shine like crystals but they call her china
She cook so good I open a diner
Specialty chickens and fish
She the reason I'm drinking designer
Cars from Germany time piece swish
She was on the block with me when I ain't have shit
She keep them Jay's happy
She never betrayed papi
My own homie tried to steal her
Damn near turned me to a killer
Nah I ain't sick of her
But I wake up everyday trying to get rid of her

[Hook]
Imma protect her, fight for her, kill for her, fast

[Verse 3]
She got me spending all my time with her
My wifey mad cause I'm always riding with her
I told her shut up, I be side with her
Never tried your old friends for your new friends
I was down with her first pers first
She more valuable then gold
Get rich off her and let her go the gold
Riding with her speed limit, going down the road
Don't get caught with her or you'll be going down the road
When you got her everybody jealous
Robbers wanna rob, snitches wanna tell it
They just mad cause she gotch you up
Try to take her, you'll get bussed, I don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Imma protect her, fight for her, kill for her, fast
If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be having all this cash
From the first time I saw her it was something bout her I know she was worth
I feel in love with her
