(Intro)
Never compromise my integrity
I live by code of ethics, morals
Values, principles
Speaking principles
You stacking principles
Nigga we never know interest nigga
Get your weight up

(Hook)
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see

(Verse 1)
I’ma make sure my family eat
This ain’t no job for me ,responsibility
Rare wonder, I’ma do her
Fuck her feeling, hit the inner state
Pull up in a different state
Tryin to get a dinner plate
My niggas trying to get them a plate
Never leaning on the table
Leave close the roads just come
Break bread among
Who fuck with you the most
Let’s have a feast, come on let’s eat
Drink up let’s have a toast to prosperity
Everywhere I go they know my name
Everywhere I go they’re always glad I came
Me and my crew put their kids through school
In return they dance to all my songs
They made me that dude, salute

(Hook)
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see

(Verse 2)
Before the real me, before the real bitch
Before the real hoes, that get the real riches
Before the real nigga, walking with real diamond
I know what they look like ’cause they live around me
They surround me
Play with me they gonna surround you they really ready
Kill you in your dreams for real freddy
Last year I bought a house right down on Elm street
Fast forward this shit I’m on the M street
I could live on any street
All my life I grew up in the street
Certain words I can’t say , some things I can’t say
Integrity, I’ma take it to the grave

(Hook)
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see

(Verse 3)
They say you never lose by love, you lose by holding back
I gave the streets my heart and in return they gave me cash
But they ain’t owe me that the game gave me what they owed me
Whatever you do put your heart into it that’s what my granny told me
You fuck with me I fuck with you I would never lie to you
Gotta be honest with yourself that’s what make you the truth
My life can’t change for the better till I took chances
Had to take some bigger risks, fuck the consequences
Somehow I made it through what it do
Fuck you mean I would get ‘em in
Where was you I don’t know
Probably laid up with a hoe
Standing up on 6′s ignorant, ridiculous
I took the extra mile, I hate crowds
Changed the way I look at things , I’m looking different
Camouflage but blend in when the time permits
Chamillion, make millions
Of my common sense, nah I ain’t passed the bar
I went passed the bar, made more than a judge
He passed the bar

(Hook)
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
Look , look , look what the streets did to me
I got blinded by the money and it’s all I see
