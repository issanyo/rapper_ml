[Verse 1 : Stuey Rock]
You see them dope boys
In the streets man to be stoned
Need to [?] like your own shit
Nigga were by your mom
You need to get up and get it
Don't wait, say another minute
That benzo , that 5 50
Them 20 [?]

[Hook : Stuey Rock]
Nothing is impossible (x7)

[Verse 2 : Rocko]
What the fuck you mean
I gang  it for 4 days for a freezy guy
What make you think [?]
Nigga , my cheese high
[?]
