[Verse 1:]
Wish I could said it be easy
But I can tell you it’s gonna be worth it though
Can’t have a testimony without a test
We real niggers but we ain’t perfect though
So keep your feet moving
Do something, get a fight
Do some bad days to earn the best days of your life
First right, without the downs the up wouldn’t mean nothing
They watch me stay down all these time, that shit don’t mean something
Get right by enemies, give a damn if it’s wrong
Waiting for the sun to shine, gotta water the storm
Sixty seconds away from giving up, hold on
That’s the same minute you tell yourself go on

[Chorus:] [x2]
Stop go in circles round and round
Life’s like a seesaw ups and downs
Up and down, up and down
Ups and down, up and down
Up and down

[Verse 2:]
They say what goes up, must come down
I say what they know, must come up
Imma break my own ground, ain’t gonna follow the path
Imma go my own route, imma leave you a trail
In the beginning you scared
Towards the ending you said
All the losses you had
That’s what make you a man
So get up these bunch
You get better and better
Once you master your craft
They got to give you that cheddar
Never get full crown, like you on empty
Stay hard, don’t show no sympathy...(show no mercy)
Quick question, when you gonna learn?
When you think about the tables
They gonna turn

[Chorus] [x2]
