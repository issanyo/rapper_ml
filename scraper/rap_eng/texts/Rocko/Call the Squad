[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
Where I'm from, everybody got a throwaway
They'll throw your life away
One carbon stock, pockets gettin' blocked
Spindles on that motherfucker I ain't runnin' from the cops
Southside in this bitch, I'm on my Riverdale shit
Shawty ass fat, can she suck a dick?
All I need is beans, styrofoam lean
Two fuckin' blunts, that'll help a nigga [?]
What's happenin'?
All green outfit, I'm smokin' non-stop, bitch
On my Rocko shit, got a check like, its here
Cigarette gang, y'all some motherfuckin' squares
Bricksquad Monopoly, this our year

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Stack on stack, we gon' make it clap
Hundred dollar bill, put it in her crack
Break your back, I'm with Freddie Mack
Twenty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Thirty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Forty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Money, I track, I'm runnin' laps on niggas
Ain't no holding back (Bricksquad!)
Go hard on 'em! Call the squad on 'em!
Go hard on 'em! Call the squad on 'em!
I ain't holdin' back, go hard on em!
I ain't holdin' back, call the squad on 'em!

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Look at me I'm flossin'
Sex, Benz with the car scent
Kit sick, A1 nigga stay [?]
What can I say, I'm saucy
First year in the game, I play varsity
Don't know why they got on my shit
Grove Streets where I lost you nigga
Vanish in that van, quick, talkin' Austin
Long Island super iced tea, my cooler, big cocoa
Ten times, my mojo, I'm like Austin
Got power like Austin
Bout to hop on a jet and head to Austin
[?] plug live in Austin
And to think the kid from Boston
Don't know why they grim, talkin' Boston
Phone call, lookin' for Boston
Make my wrists look like they should be coughing
Walk in the door, hoes jumpin' up and down
They rejoicing, and your main bitch [?]
Got a team full of killers and I endorse them
Ride with a dumb sack, reinforcement
All my cars supercharged, they horsin'
Ain't worried 'bout enforcement
Seen my loft, I send her off then
That's my main bitch, thanks to her I'm flossin'

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Stack on stack, we gon' make it clap
Hundred dollar bill, put it in her crack
Break your back, I'm with Freddie Mack
Twenty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Thirty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Forty bands? Throwin' that (Flex)
Money, I track, I'm runnin' laps on niggas
Ain't no holding back (Bricksquad!)
Go hard on 'em! Call the squad on 'em!
Go hard on 'em! Call the squad on 'em!
I ain't holdin' back, go hard on em!
I ain't holdin' back, call the squad on 'em!
