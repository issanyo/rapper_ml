[Verse 1]
She tryna squeeze her ass in them pants
I’m tryna squeeze this cash in these bands
Coupe solo, this is solo gotta squeeze
Dolo, walk right in got my squeeze in
Slapping straight shot, squeeze two lines
Squeeze her ass one time she fine

Are you my main squeeze, slide ‘fore I squeeze you
Main will be hundred how you bees on a label
Drain a main vein, gon’ squeeze on a nigga
Now she squeezing me
Nigga I got your squeeze with me

[Hook]
I got my squeeze on me
I got your squeeze with me
And she gon’ squeeze for me
Don’t make her squeeze on you
Don’t make her squeeze on you
Don’t make me squeeze on you

Don’t make me squeeze on you
Don’t make me squeeze on you
Don’t make me squeeze on you

And she gon’ squeeze for me
Don’t make her squeeze on you

[Verse 2]
Direct you, I won’t mislead you
Serve you, ain’t gon’ tease you
It’s my pleasure for me to please you
If I hold you I’m gonna squeeze you
Made up my squeeze, these niggas wanna be
I Ain't tryna fight it off, my nigga, I’m a squeeze on you

She wanna hug me, squeeze me
Love me, she need me
She touch me, she treat me
She rub me, she please me
Every time she hug me, she squeeze on me
Every time I fuck her my squeeze on me

[Hook]
