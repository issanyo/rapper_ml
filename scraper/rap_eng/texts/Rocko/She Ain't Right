[Intro:]
Ooh
That bitch ain’t right
Yeah
Strictly for the motherfucking traps and the trunks

[Verse 1:]
She all for herself, she bout her fetta sheen
Got no ethics, nah, if you paying she staying
You ain’t, she in the wind
Out of feel, shrewd attitude she ain’t gon’ pretend
The only thing she loyal to is them dividends
She gon’ get it from you or get it from him
Or should I say them? She’ll fuck your friend
Then double back, you ask her about it
She’ll be like whet? Mind your business
Stay in your lane nigga
She’ll just destroy your emotions, She know you a lame nigga
She gives a damn bout who you are
Fuck your fame nigga
She out here playing, she ain’t looking for no lame nigga
Beautiful girl, body immaculate, extravagant
Crème de la crème, strive for the best
She fall for ever rich
Her smile the hook, soon as you look you’re booked
You gon’ do whatever it takes, you did whatever it took
Poof! Vamos, she gone, I can’t even say she wrong
Cause so much be going on, she gotta take care of her own

[Chorus:]
Man I really like that girl but the bitch ain’t right
But man I really like girl
Man I really like that girl but the bitch ain’t right
(Man I like that girl)
But man I really like girl
(Said I like that girl yeah)

[Verse 2:]
We been fucking for a lil second
Our relationship kinda reckless
I know we shoulda never intertwined
Cause I’m married and you will never be mine
Even if it wasn’t you got a background
But I love the way she rub a nigga back down
Backing fist, I’m really catching feelings for her
I know she ain’t right but she just fill this void
My niggas think I’m fucking tripping
I don’t give a fuck that she like women
That’s my boo thaing, her name is rolling cool mane
Man she just do things that drive a nigga insane

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Gew up in the gutter, fuck what other people talking bout
I love the way she comforts me when I’m alone
Fast moving, no cocoons it’s the Cancun
Buy the fragrances, scented lotion
But that’s how I’m told shit
Nothing no amateur, handling the moment
I come here cause she’s for real for all other components
Rumour surfaces said she already fucked one of my own
But when you in the lane I may never give in to notice
Nigga nipples, ass wiggly tickle
She want it up against the sofa
Bend her over, she love it
She moaning in the morning
Walking like a horse, biting this and that
Dropping bands on designer brands, that’s in the mix of this

[Chorus]
