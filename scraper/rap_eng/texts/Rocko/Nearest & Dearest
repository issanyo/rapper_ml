Letter to my nearest and dearest
This a Letter to my nearest and dearest
I just pray that you hear this
Letter to my nearest and dearest

[Verse 1]
I might come off the weirdest but it’s coming from my spirit
Letter to my nearest and dearest
I’m a talk you through my lyrics I just pray to god you hear this
Letter to my nearest and dearest
Uh hold applause before I start
I apologize if I broke your heart
I was wrong you was right
I was living at the speed of light
The mind of boss and your mind you be speaking
But I still be there to pick you up this weekend
Shout out to young don he’s on his way
4.0 you got that GPA
If you knew what I went thru to provide for you
Just so you could do the things that I didn’t do
I know it feel like I be riding you
I probably do it but boy I’m proud of you

[Verse 2]
At night making the appear on the road doing shows
Seeing most cities down a tourist
Still my vision ain’t cleared posters on a tears
And I still can’t see the fires
One for the tree that could talk as power
Do this shit forever I swear all this shit is ours
To all my n*ggas you the realest I love you my n*gga
You gon feel this if you hear this
No paper no pen just straight spitting from the bottom of my heart
That’s how I rid this
It’s like it’s hard to be cursed if I know this talking person
So what I just awkwardly verses
