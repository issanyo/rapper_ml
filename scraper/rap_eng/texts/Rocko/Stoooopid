(Hook)
I put them 6′s on my whip they say I’m stoopid
Till I pull up with their bitch they lookin stoopid
The suckers say I couldn’t rap they sound I’m stoopid
Then I make millions off the shit they lookin stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
I just think I fit the benz up on my wrist that bitch look stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
Then I wrap circles around your scratch you nigga stoopid

(Verse)
Push button with my thumb I was having it
Anything you name I was having it
M in it, come on let the stink up
Multi million dollar deals inked up
Guards don’t slow ‘em mess with that
Fill the back bury that
Treasure that , tell that to my treasurer
Kiss my ol girl mommy know that I treasure her
Tell that to the other girl, I was paying cash for her
By myself all alone , no lone
Ain’t puzzled by my own marry
With a little bit
I carry all by my lonesome
So I got it if you want some
Give it to her raw let her hold some
Send her both
Everything I touched I let it go like a good soul
Kick what you get gotta pay for
Be there since a kid out the little streets look out for me
In return they live through me
In surprise I did, gotta get back
Never look don’t mind trip
We trip keep it moving kay I am
I could never winnin since the beginning
Shark won’t swim, and switch it up all the coke on the sunny side
I’ma pop them hurricane, what the fuck you mean
With the scale broke that great earth wrap for the sports street
Play 30 got a liquor never let the sun beat you up
Upper cut, you are the cut so I no flaw

(Hook)
I put them 6′s on my whip they say I’m stoopid
Till I pull up with their bitch they lookin stoopid
The suckers say I couldn’t rap they sound I’m stoopid
Then I make millions off the shit they lookin stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
I just think I fit the benz up on my wrist that bitch look stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
Then I wrap circles around your scratch you nigga stoopid

(Verse)
Look I don’t really think about me
Saw me how they come at the him here gym
Not a flaw, couple scars wild wolves we can trade
War story, worthy of a atrocious, glorious
I read take me to euforia
Agile, edible never take advantage
I was added early, searching I’ma edit
Won’t supply never subtract it
Divided amongst ourselves that’s the team work
Get a whole team my job let that team work
Team work, team work let that dream work
No machine work, talking clean work
Flawless dope king see I’ma I’ma
Streets on the me they wanna me
Mama die know she love her grand baby
Ever does she text me she say she pray pray for a grandbaby
Broken down lord oh ye I’m a grand baby
89 991 I’ma ye baby born in the treat mame me who I am
Baby ride around with my babies
Thank God that I made it
Since art that I made it
Bet against the odds I ain’t faded
Walls broke now
Phase I did that to the cash I be fiending for a fish
Need help I don’t care I go get it by myself

(Hook)
I put them 6′s on my whip they say I’m stoopid
Till I pull up with their bitch they lookin stoopid
The suckers say I couldn’t rap they sound I’m stoopid
Then I make millions off the shit they lookin stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
I just think I fit the benz up on my wrist that bitch look stoopid
Stoopid, stoopid
Then I wrap circles around your scratch you nigga stoopid
