[Intro:]
[Drank and smoke, shit
They wanna know how to get rich
Hold up, hold up
All you need is drank and smoke nigga
Read between the line fool
Get money]

[Chors:] [x2]
Drank and smoke, drank and smoke (drank and smoke) [x2]
Drank and smoke, Smoke and drank
Smoke and drank, Drank and smoke
Drank and smoke, drank and smoke (drank and smoke)

[Verse 1:]
Why drink and drive when you can smoke and fly
I ain’t smoking no more but I ain’t smoking no less
I ain’t smoking no red, I’m only smoking the best
I’m on the top of the shelf, I’m only sipping the best
We ain’t drinking no more but I ain’t drinking no less
Shawty pulled me close got drink on the dress
Got drink on my shirt and she licking my neck
Spilt drink on the floor she kept drinking some more
Back to the cask, here drink from the low
Get smoke for the dough
The money running me crazy, Ion know if I’m coming or going
Got me drinking my crisp, smoking patrol
It’s all going down, I deliver that strong
I handle my loss, I pray my liver is strong
SMoke and drink, wish I could stop but I can't
I drink and smoke, I smoke and drink

[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I don’t know how to act when I pour out a pint
In my two seater, drink straight out the litre
G’s on me but I’m rocking Bally’s
In the hood like Rally’s make em look like Cali
I should tell you better check her
I let her drink it out the bottle
Smoking high octane, we on the gas for twice
Smoking out a bag when I roll up a dozen
Took hunnid to dash, what the fuck is a clutch
Put on a front when I pulls to a club
Want two straight shots before I come with the blunt
Burn one, burn two, burn three
Burn one for you, burn two for me
I’m so piped up, I’m so iced up
Until they say yo people put your lighters up
And my zone boy dumb. Still going in this morning
I handle my lungs, I pray my liver is strong
I smoke, I drink
Decide to stop but I can’t
I drink, I smoke
I smoke and drink

[Chorus] [x2]
