[Intro]
Outside
Can’t catch up on the lingo you slow
Yeah, you probly be in the inside
While I be in the trench all day

[Chorus:]
While you niggas in my house I be outside
They see my nigga that’s inside yet i’m outside
Outside, outside,  outside,  outside
I can’t leave these streets alone I grew up outside
Outside, outside,  outside,  outside [x2]
Cross me at your home i’ll be outside
I can’t leave these streets alone i played up outside

[Verse 1:]
I do what the fuck I want to cause I got cash
Nands got my pants sitting on my ass
Toolie on the waist cause you crossed that path
[? line] for all that jazz
Ice so clear look just like glass
Fish scale pack look just like bags
Riding 166 with something look like grass
Put some light on the rifle man you like the task
Car really fast i’ll be gone in a flash
Throw it in the gutter by another if I crash
Got 10 more European partner stash
I sold all of them stash tryna get me a bag
I bust out all a dem raps nigga look at the trash
Skate round through Atlanta with a stick [?] trash
Grew up fast grew up brass
Better hold your  [?] cause if you do you get smashed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Outside bitch bad inside white
Turn a nina to a Tina beat that girl like Ike
I was serving J(s) tryna knock up on some J(s)
Took flight….Nike
Lil short kid never had that much height
Never had fear no I never been frightened
Not quite, i’m on site
When you grew up outside gotta know how to fight
They got ma brother inside just flew him in kite
Stay eating everyday steak, shrimp sipping sprite
You know how it is outside, see em on the road everyday
Know the words to ma song they recite
Remember when the po po used to chase me on my bike
Now they want all the grab for their kids and the wife
Oh yeah he be like, damn thats a Ice
Put the  [?]  four outside

[Chorus]
