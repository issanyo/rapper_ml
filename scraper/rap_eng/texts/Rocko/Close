[Hook]
Close I’m close I’m so close that I can feel it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can smell it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can grab it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close I gotta have it
I can see it I’m so close I can feel it
I’m so close I’m so close I’m so close I’m so close
Close close so far but I’m so close
How could something so far be so close

[Verse 1]
Hey I’m so close I can smell it
I’m so close I can taste it
I’m so close I can nail it
It’s a call for celebration buy a bottle let’s get wasted
All this talent I got I be a fool if I waste it
This close to lose but I’m this close to winning
And this close to ending it this close to quitting
Then I’m this closing to stark yeah and I’m that close to stock
I’m this close to charts but I’m that close to flop
Man I feel very close but that ain’t close enough
I lost close family I lost close friends
I just close my eyes feel like the walls are closing in
I try my best to stay out the streets but I’m too close to them

[Hook]
Close I’m close I’m so close that I can feel it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can smell it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can grab it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close I gotta have it
I could it see I could feel it I’m so close I’m so close I’m so close
Close close so far but I’m so close
How could something so far be so close

[Verse 2]
They say been close to bad but they been close to good
So I moved the studio back
I came back close to the hood
Yeah close to the city that mean I’m close to the vulture
Keep your friends really close but your enemies closer
Really close to my mom ain’t really that close to my pop
Made the distance louder for me to get closer to God
So close but yet so far
Our bodies are in the same place but our hearts are miles apart
Man
Today I just need closure
Maybe tomorrow we’ll be closer
Maybe it was worth the hurt that’s what I’m hoping
Close one door and that’s when another one open

[Hook]
Close I’m close I’m so close that I can feel it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can smell it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close that I can grab it
I’m close I’m close I’m so close I gotta have it

[Outro]
I can see it I’m so close I can feel it
I’m so close I’m so close I’m so close I’m so close
Close close so far but I’m so close
How could something so far be so close
