You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine

[Verse 1]
Shine like the sun, fuck who you offend
Shine like a light, keep your shine on bright
Shine like the moon, shine like a star
Real stars shine harder when it's dark
Shine like a diamond, go to bed shining
Wake up, rise and grind, make sure you tone your shine
Shine like the summer, I'mma shine how I wanna
You can't kill my shine, I'm a knight in shining armour
Shine for my granny, I'mma shine for my mama
I'mma shine for my hood, I'mma shine for my city
I'mma shine on all you niggas, I keep my shine on blind
It's my time to shine, it's my, it's my time to shine

[Hook]
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine

[Verse 2]
More ice, more wrist
Palm trees, it's a shortage
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, any weather
Rolls Royce, umbrellas, this shit forever
Leather bucket low like fuck it though
They ask me why I drive the Bentley like a Cutlass though
You know, hit the club number of sparklers and bottles
Neck, ears, wrist, look like sparkling water

[Hook]
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine, you can't block my shine
You can't block my shine

[Bridge]
You can't block, you can't block
You can't block, you can't block
You can't block, you can't block
You can't block, you can't block
