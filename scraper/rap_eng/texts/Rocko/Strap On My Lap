[Intro: Rocko]
Pussy ass niggas got me strapped, got me ridin' round wit the strap
Pussy ass niggas got me ridin' with the strap, they got me ridin' round wit the strap
These pussy niggas talk smack, got me ridin' round wit the strap
These niggas really want static, got me ridin' round wit the strap

[Hook]
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my got my, strap on my lap

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Iron packer, better defense then the fucking line backer
They offended by my offense, difference is i'm a trapper
They some actors
I get money while they boo us, while they mad
Fuck it, I'ma make em madder
You don't even matter, you're a fucking non-factor
Real as they come, one of one
They come a fool when they come after
Cross me, that's the end of your chapter
I fuck your bitch last night she said I hit it better
Take your shoes off in my house, fool this alpaca
You can have her, I done had her
Get the [?] in the home, my bitch is badder
Back to the subject of the matter, nigga sharper than a dagger
Add more dapper to my swagger, add more amo to my yopper
Add more cash, more meals on my platter
Bitch i'm an adder, still I subtract ya
Pussy niggas hate you when you climbing up that ladder
Worried bought me nigga I fucked around and lapped you
Catch you with your pants down, hit you with the [?]
Whips and stack em, pull up with shine like some roaches then they scatter
Top drop, got a spot for the strap but I keep it in my lap
In case a nigga act up
I got something, make them back up

[Hook]
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my got my, strap on my lap

[Verse 2: Rocko]
These pussy ass niggas got me strapped
Don't trust a chicken head, they some BAPS
Get the fuck up off the phone nigga I know you hear the tap
Well read niggas sold cat
Fuck around get a hole in your hat
Get a whole and no flip and no flap
This a strap not a gat, trust this you'll want that
Been out here all my life, niggas ain't put a scarin' on me yet
That's a motherfucking fact fuck around and get wack
Knock your ass off your feet, roll by myself still a nigga 100 deep
A&R [?] with them extra tens in (extendo, extendo)
Ain't gonna miss a fucking beat
Make a nigga take a nap
Me? i'm a rapping up these raps
I let you niggas, do that rack
Me? I push the buttons like an app
Yeah, them pussy niggas laughing until that stick starts slapping
Yeah, have them niggas running laps
Clap on clap off like the clapper
All my men in black my nigga tell me where its at
Wordplay king niggas know they can't catch
Curve ball king i'm the pitcher they the catcher
One shot one kill nigga no rematch
A nigga still ratchet, rolling with the ratchet

[Hook]
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, keep my strap on my lap
Strap on my lap, got my got my, strap on my lap
