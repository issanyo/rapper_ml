They want my car (get in line)
They want my watch (get in line)
They want my bitch (get in line)
They want my spot (get in line)
Say he don’t like me (get in line)
I say that’s fine (get in line)
She wanna fuck me (get in line)
Get in line (get in line)
[?] hate me (get in line)
Don’t give a fuck (get in line)
Say he don’t like me (get in line)
Tough luck (get in line)
Long line (get in line)
Get in line (get in line)
Get out of line (get in line)
Get put in line (get in line)

[Verse 1]
Shawty asked me for my sign
She say she a designer
I said no thanks, I’m straight baby
I got a line
Renaissance Rocko, I’m so head of my time
Nigga got that fish, I use my bitch for base
Stay on this line
Told you I ain’t want no more money, nigga I be lying
Family phone, cash phone, my only two lines
Damn shawty be riding, he go hard every time
Every time he got a show I guarantee it’s a long line
I’m a Capricorn, born hustler, better check my sign
More stripes than a zebra, nigga got more heart than a lion
The streets made of gold, you know I had to make em mine
Them fuck niggas want my spot I told them suckers get in line

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pussy nigga got a line
I smacked him a couple times
I’m the fucking don bitch, you better stay in line
Get money, I stack miles in a line
Help me kill time
Nigga want a feature, told him 20 bands, 12 lines
A1 since day one, been getting money a long time
Check my pedigree, I come from a long line
Granddaddy was a hustler, he passed it down the line
[?] showing my ass, every time
[?] my partner snort the line, hell, I don’t mind
Long and winded, time to line up, they be on the line
Migo say he on the way, I told him I got a line
Rocked around the block, they said they want the block I told them get in line
