[Intro]
Yeah, I keep it turned up to the max
Live every day like it's your last
Okay, okay, doing it for the streets

[Hook]
Dis morning, I woke up
Feeling like money, I jumped up
Put on my Guccis and my hat
Got my bag, got my strap
Gotta start rolling, I was thinking
'Bout Jacksons, Grants, and Ben Franklins
Only thing on my mind, getting dough
Getting dough, getting dough

[Verse 1]
Only thing on my mind is money, money, money
For some reason she just be calling my name
I guess it's all in the game
'Cause I always run get her, she a part of me, mane
I left the studio at seven, took a three hour nap
Ten o'clock flashed, I'm right back in the trap
I been addicted to the money for more than half my life
Grew up fast, I bought a car, ain't never had a wife
Boss player type of cat, I never had a wife
I'm married to the cash, she treat her daddy right
Fuck you, what would I do if I ain't had my muscle?
I don't know, where would I go if I ain't have this hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Only thing on my mind from the get-go
Is wake up, get up, time to get dough
Only thing on my mind is the bubble
So I can all of my niggas out the gutter
Only thing on my mind is to be the best
Number one, won't settle for anything less
Only thing on my mind is do my thing
Break bread with my team
Only thing on my mind is to stack my cash
Ball every day just like it's my last
Only thing on my mind is my kids
So they ain't gotta do the shit that I did

[Hook x2]
