[Hook x4]
Watch cost bout' a Bentley
And my ring cost bout' a brick

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm the man, goddamn I'm the man
Future price so high you need a layaway plan
Your girlfriend made me call you and said stay away man
She easy as a free throw so you fade away fast
My ring cost bout' a brick, my watch cost bout' a Benz
Your main chick on my dick, she let me smash her friends
My earrings are so cold, they look like they on fire
You think your stones are colder, I think that you a liar
I hold court in the street, I'm the judge so bring my jewelry
And ain't no one gon' take it so no need to get insurance
My chain cost bout' a Bentley and my trunk cost bout' a Phantom
I'm the King of East Atlanta and I'm shining like a lemon

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
You know my time is my money, my money is my time
And I ain't wasting either, so have it on your mind
I shine like a diamond with the cuts of a princess
Ya bitch call me daddy when I fuck her like its incest
Oooo how [?], why you standing close to her
You should be like me and let her go like just you supposed to bruh
Put her on a poster, a flyer and a bottle
[?] in a minute while you high-steppin your prada
I'm all about a dollar if you with me gon' n' holla'
She's a spitter I ain't wit' her, you gotta roll or swalla'
Or we can't talk money, we can't chop green
Or convo' about the cabbage if you know what I mean

[Hook x8]

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Watch me kick it on these suckers like judo
Motley swag's on jones, catch me off in Pluto
All hoes still gon' ice this track, the new hoes
Still the same won't catch me in this thing unless it's two doors
Bitch got on my old dough now I got new dough
Still spending 1991 and '92 dough
Hoes like [?] we the coldest niggas' you know
Everybody have [????]
All the while porque I'm getting cake
How bout' you though?
Favorite food chicken still heavy eating noodles [?] and butter
Gucci, Bun, and Rocko, need I say more
We the vic-tors, kiss my ring whore
