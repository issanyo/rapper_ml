(Verse)
Is it just me or is it this world
Some days I’m happy
Some days I’m not
Do I have to be a better girl to make you realize what you got
When you're ready come and tell me baby
When you're ready let me know baby

Turning around there you are again
Saying I’m an unfaithful friend
But that’s not me
I’ve never been
Anything but your true friend
I don’t know where to go with this
I don’t know how to deal with it
I don’t know where to go with this
I don’t know how to deal with it ,so………

(Chorus)
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
When feelings were no issue, when all I had was the truth
Lead me to those better days
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days

(Rocko)
Ah, some days are better than others, why complain it does nothing for us, nothing
Everything I do is for us
Never them, were better than them , hurricanes weather them
One thing I can’t stand is pessimist, stay optimistic
Live your life, make the best of it
If you run the day or run sure
We came into the world alone, who can we run to, nobody
If you fall on your face you’re still moving forward
Get up, dust yourself off, keep going forward
Never complain, never explain
Our problems aren’t stop signs, they’re guidelines
Well done better than well said
You gotta conquer fear
Can’t walk around scared
Winners never quit
Quitters never win, everyday is a new beginning
May it never end
Umbrella case the rain comes
It say rainbows after the rain storms

(Verse)
Tomorrow there’s gonna be some rain
Need somebody to hold my hand
I gotta face this on my own
Gotta walk through this storm
And come out on the other side
With my head high and with a smile
I just wanna be alone again, I just wanna be alone again
Just wanna be alone again

(Chorus)
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
When feelings were no issue, when all I had was the truth
Lead me to those better days
Lead me to those better days
I don’t care what it takes
I wanna see those better days
I wanna see those better days
I wanna see those, see those better days
Lead me to those better days
