[Verse 1: Yoonmirae]
Fighter
With my back against the wall
Said that you've had enough
But you still take my calls
I need to know
I need to know
If there's any fight left
For us to make it all right
Tell me what's the next step?

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
I’ma fighter
What do you wanna do now?
You a fighter?
Whatever you gotta go through
Fighter
Baby it's up to you
Whatever you wanna do
I'm down with it
Ohhhhhh
It's up to you
Whatever you goin through
I'm down with it

[Bridge: Yoonmirae]
Fighter
Knock me down but I’ll keep fighting
For you til’ the end we’ll keep on trying
Like a fighter
Knock us down but we’re survivors
For love, til’ the end we’ll keep on fighting

[Refrain: Yoonmirae]
Fighter
Fighter
Fighter
Fighter

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
Ohhhhhhh
It's up to you
Whatever you wanna do
I'm down with it
Ohhhhhhh
It's up to you
Whatever you goin through
I'm down with it

[Verse 2: Yoonmirae]
Fighter
With my back against the wall
Said that you've had enough
But you still take my calls
I need to know
I need to know
If there's any fight left
For us to make it all right
Tell me what's the next step

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
I’ma fighter
What do you wanna do now?
You a fighter?
Whatever we gotta go through
Fighter
Baby it's up to you
Whatever you wanna do
I'm down with it
It's up to you
Whatever you goin through
I'm down with it
It's up to you
Whatever you goin through
I'm down with it
