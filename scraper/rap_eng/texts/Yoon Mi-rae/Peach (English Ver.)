[Verse 1]
Boy I got your number
Make me lose count
Grab below my waist
Feel it's so round
It's a private show and
Now it's sold out
Feel the motion in my ocean
Leave you with no doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
Are your eyes on me
Let me control it
Pull on my braids babe
Poetic justice
Give me that head game
That too good to function
Too good to function

[Chorus]
Boy you got me
Shaking in my knees
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
We gon' get together
Shut the world right out
This my favorite lesson
Let me teach
You know that I practice
What I preach
I'ma give you
What you've given me
Come on over
Get you something
Sweet right now
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach

[Verse 2]
Got no time for wasting
This moment's for taking
Breath's away
So take it now
You like what you see
Pick from the tree
Put it on you
Forbidden and free
Give and receive
That's you and me
That's how I want it to be
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Are your eyes on me
Let me control it
Pull on my braids babe
Poetic justice
Give me that head game
That too good to function
Too good to function

[Chorus]
Boy you got me
Shaking in my knees
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
We gon' get together
Shut the world right now
This my favorite lesson
Let me teach
You know that I practice
What I preach
I'ma give you
What you've given me
Come on over
Get you something sweet
Right now
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach

[Refrain]
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach

[Chorus]
Boy you got me
Shaking in my knees
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
We gone get together
Shut the world right now
This my favorite lesson
Let me teach
You know that I practice
What I preach
I'ma give you
What you give in me
Come on over
Get you something sweet
Right now
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
Drippin drippin
Drippin from the peach
