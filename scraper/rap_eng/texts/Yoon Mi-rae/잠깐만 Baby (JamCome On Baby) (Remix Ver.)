All I wanna do is make you happy
When it comes you I have no pride
Just livin' for every moment
I get to have you by my side
And I know that you'll be
So lit with it baby
Gotta feelin' about you boy
I just can't shake
A love like ours is in the stars
The stars
Written in the stars for us
Baby come and visit
I just wanna vibrAte
Maybe we can move away
And go and migrate

It's funny how money
Change situations
When you getting paper
We can take vacations
Needed passports
For ya destinations
Surpass everybody
With they expectations
Baby come and visit
I just wanna vibrAte
Maybe we can move away
And go and migrate
You got a migraine
I can get your mind straight
We way past one night
Stands and blind dates
I'm patient if you coming tell me
How much time it take
Before you get here
Just call me when you near
And when you do appear
We can go and disappear
To a new frontier
You ain't gotta front dear
I say it with sincerity in a moment
Of clarity that
When we get together it be like
We having therapy and
I'll be waiting lights down
You don't have to come soon
But come right now
Please

Say this to ya right right away
