Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
Woke up this morning I’m grateful
Walk in these heels and I’m graceful
We get the dollars and payload
This is the moment we pray for
I don’t know why they hateful
But don’t play with me
I’m not playful
All my girls are
Still starving hard and
They’ll eat your plate if I say so
Expensive taste with my appetite
All we wanted is a happy life
So everyday we make a sacrifice
Move to the left
If you ain’t acting right
Everyday here is amazing
Look at me daddy I made it
They never thought
We would make it
I’m cooking up with no apron
Top chef top chef
T is blessed Fuck the stress
All my dreams I manifest
My whole tribe is on a quest
We kick it with no question
We don’t need your suggestions
Take those L’s as a lesson
We live life as a blessing
Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
I’m confident but not boastful
Bilingual bicoastal
Soul food
In Seoul Korea
While playing music that soulful
New York I’m in Soho
Melrose on the west coast
Say a toast with my day ones
No new friends we not social
So this suppose to be part of me
Go I’m at the top of my artistry
No you are not stopping
Us pardon me
We going hard
And we partying partying
This is the time that we feel alive
Might spill the drink
But don’t kill the vibe
We Entertain then enterprise
We used to struggle we improvise
Got to the point
Where we don’t even care
When we was
Struggling you wasn’t there
We kept on hustling
Knew we would double it
Champagne was bubbling
Love in air
Might catch us at a festival
We successful now so exceptional
No stressing here be respectable
It’s a special moment
Just to let you know
Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
Don’t worry bout nothing
Don’t care what they say
We living our best life
Just let us be great
Aye aye aye aye
Cuz this the life and we feel good
Champagne taste real good
Been around and I’m still hood
