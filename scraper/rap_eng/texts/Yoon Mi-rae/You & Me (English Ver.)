[Verse 1: Yoonmirae]
You and me
We stay between the lines
And this chemistry
So hot that we on fire
Your girlfriend wouldn't
Understand
And my guy wouldn't understand
So we play it like we just friends
We ain't lying
We real good friends
You and me
We stay between the lines

[Hook: Yoonmirae]
If they ever ask you
How we know each other
Just say it ain't nothing like that

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
Know she good know he good
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
That's just my, that's just my
That's just my friend

[Verse 2: Yoonmirae]
We keep it quiet
And that's just what it is
But the way we vibe
The shit don't make no sense
Your girlfriend wouldn't
Understand
And my guy wouldn't understand
So we play it like we just friends
We ain't lying
We real good friends
You and me
We stay between the lines

[Hook: Yoonmirae]
If they ever ask you
How we know each other
Just say it ain't nothing like that

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
Know she good know he good
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
That's just my that's just my
That's just my friend

[Verse 3: Junoflo]
I gotta keep it real with ya
I'm tryna make a fam and
Some mills with ya
Looking like a snack and a meal
With your fine ass walking by
How them jeans fit you
Oh my god
Body bag
She got me dead
I'm like damn that body bad
You my stunna winter
Spring fall summer
More than friends
Can I keep it one hunnid
I just wanna go and
Get to know ya
She love to yoga and
To hit the doja
I know the game and
You playin' hard to get
Why you playin'
Why you playin'
What you sayin'

[Chorus: Yoonmirae]
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
Know she good know he good
That's just my friend
Tell 'em you ain't gotta worry about them
That's just my friend
That's just my that's just my
That's just my friend
