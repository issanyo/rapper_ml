We movin low movin low moving undercover
I don’t need to flex it
But we on the cover
We moving low moving low yeah we undercover
I ain’t like you suckas
I’m way out your budget
Undercover, undercover
You never see me but you’ll catch me on that cover
Undercover, undercover
You never see me but you’ll catch me on that cover

I’m draped from head to toe in undercover
I hear they story but I never trust em
I get to bussin and it’s no discussion
I don’t care if you don't feel me, I’ma make you love it
I see you stunting like you onto something
They moving loud so I know they bluffin
Chains rearranged, phone started jumpin
You could stay below the heavens, watch me rise above it
I don’t fear no repercussions, I just get it and go
I know karma come around so you reap what you sow
On the low that’s how I’m moving
I don’t need to announce every move that I’m making
I know you poorly mistaken
Fade to black, go ＆ flex on that gram
Issa trap, and it never lets you back so react and adapt
Never crack, never do my raps lack, let me snap
I’m just tryna put my city on the map

We movin low movin low moving undercover
I don’t need to flex it
But we on the cover
We moving low moving low yeah we undercover
I ain’t like you suckas
I’m way out your budget
Undercover, undercover
You never see me
But you’ll catch me on that cover
Undercover, undercover
You never see me
But you’ll catch me on that cover

We was under estimated
And under appreciated
Under pressure
I’m the greatest a diamond what I created
I just overcompensated
I’m as sharp as they come
I should rap with a razor keep it under my tongue
Yoon Mi Rae spit fire hottest under the sun
I dont do subliminal I come to your pub
Hair due under the crown Wonder Woman is here
I understand deep inside this the moment you fear
Just a scared lil kid you was undercover
You got a fire deep inside but it’s undiscovered
Better tell the undertaker we’ll be fresh to death
And make all the hater bitches mumble under they breath
Chilling Under umbrellas underworld's Cinderella
I can see to the future I don’t need a fortune teller
I’m deeper than submarine going underwater
It’s under control and We remain unbothered

We movin low movin low moving undercover
I don’t need to flex it
But we on the cover
We moving low moving low
Yeah we undercover
I ain’t like you suckas
I’m way out your budget
Undercover, undercover
You never see me
But you’ll catch me on that cover
Undercover, undercover
You never see me
But you’ll catch me on that cover
