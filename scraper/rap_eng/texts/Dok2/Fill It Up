Fill it up, fill it up
Fill up my cup
Fill it up, fill it up
Me can’t get enough
I can tell by the way your body’s shaking
And I can tell by the way your body’s swaying
I don’t think that your feeling the sensation
No, no
Although you don’t know it
And I see you don’t blink
The words are written down just so you see
I want you, I need you
Ooh girl you got to fill it up…
Give you all the stars and bliss
Jewels on your wrist
Got to fill it up
Got me on a trip saying
One little girl stepping up to me
Said she loves the vibes
And I caught her dancing
Attracted to the hype, attracted to the scene
So in love, don’t know a thing about me
Now tell me would you love me if I didn’t have money
To give you all the stars and bliss
Jewels on your wrist
Now this thing just getting funny
Dancing like she wants some tips
Got me on a trip saying
Got to fill it up
Give you all the stars and bliss
Jewels on your wrist
Got to fill it up
Got me on a trip saying
From Monday to Sunday
I know her heart’s clean cause that’s where the sun deh
Sometimes your actions got me wondering
If you’re here for me
Or just a look something
So won’t you fill it, fil it, fill it, fill it
Come gimme di love girl
Give it give it
The good life come make we live it
Get a taste of real love
Nuh fraid fi take a sip
Got me on a trip saying
Got to fill it up
Give you all the stars and bliss
Jewels on your wrist
Got to fill it up
Got me on a trip saying
