I got a new girl
She the baddest one yet
All i gotta do is smile
And her panties get wet
I've been cocky lately
Cuz i get who i want
And you can't say that you better
Cuz you wanna fuck yo aunt
You may get money
But that don't matter yet
Cuz in a few years
I'll be getting bigger checks
I'll be gettin all that cash
You know i'm gon make it rain
While yo girl on her knees
Givin me that brain
They say i'm a rap god
Cuz i be coughing and sneezing
My flow is so sick
It worse than flu season
You can't talk shit
Cuz you say it repeatedly
But sometimes you mumble
And i get the win easily
Open your eyes
Say i can't get kiss
You tried to fuck with crystal
That shi was a hit and miss
Then you downgraded
To that ugly bitch jasmine
You fucked her in a book store
Nigga why you even rappin
I'm just gettin started
Gettin that fire going
Why you fuckin wit me
Nigga you annoying
Back to that last verse
I was a little weak
But i'm strong enough
To take your girl in a wink
Now for reverse
You can't do this shit
You stuck recording on mac
And can't even spit

In reverse
I promised the reverse
So play this shit back
Cuz even in reverse
This nigga still gettin attacked

(Normal)
Forward or reverse nigga
I'm still winning
I don't need to go second
Here take the bottom inning
Call me fat
Call me a fake mexican
Already heard your shit
Gotta hear it again
