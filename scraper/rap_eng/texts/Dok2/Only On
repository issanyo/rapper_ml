VR부터 4K까지
낮이 아닌 밤 아니 하루를 같이 하지
집에만 두긴 허전해 어디든 같이 가지
Korea to Japan from Korea to Hawaii

누군가에겐 평생 꿈이었을 이것
누군가에겐 꿈이 이뤄지는 이곳
누군가에겐 또 쉼터가 되는 이역
PlayStation 올라타봐 지금 위로

숨막히는 현실을 피해
Stress따윈 던져버려 뒤에 멀리 위에
내가 바래왔던 곳을 향해 빨리 뛰어
듀얼쇼크 들어 너와 나의 삶을 위해

여길 떠나 숨막히는 현실을 피해
Stress따윈 던져버려 뒤에 멀리 위에
내가 바래왔던 곳을 향해 빨리 뛰어
두 눈 앞에 펼쳐지는 또 하나의 미래

난 원할 때면 언제든지 수퍼카를 몰아
난 원할 때면 언제든지 트로피를 모아
이런 나를 뭐라 부르던지 뭐든 좋아
우리들의 세상에서 모두 함께 우리 놀아
이곳에선 언제나 늘 내가 주인공
원한다면 될 수 있어 모든 것의 주인도
이곳에선 언제나 늘 내가 주인공
원한다면 될 수 있어 모든 것의 주인도

From VR to 4k
Not just the daytime or nighttime
But spending a whole day together
Don’t wanna leave it just at home
I’ll bring it with me wherever I go
Korea to Japan from Korea to Hawaii

This is someone’s lifelong dream
This place is where someone will fulfill their dreams
This station is also someone’s resting place
PlayStation, get on top

Avoid the suffocating reality
Throw away stress, behind you, far away
Running quickly to the place I wanted to go
Lifting that dual shock for our lives

Let’s leave this place, away from the suffocating reality
Throw away stress, behind you, far away
Running quickly to the place I wanted to go
Another future spreading before my eyes

Whenever I want, I can ride a super car
Whenever I want, I can gather my trophies
I don’t care what you call me
We’re all playing together in the same world
I’m always the star in this place
If I want, I can become the master of all
I’m always the star in this place
If I want, I can become the master of all
