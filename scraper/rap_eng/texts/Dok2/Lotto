[Hook: Vernon]
Now I’m on my way to whatever’s waitin’
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Fuck what they’d be talkin’ ‘bout (fuck they talkin’ ‘bout)
Their opinion doesn’t count, like ooh
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Yes sir without a doubt
2015 is the lotto number, like ooh
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto
Lotto lotto lotto lotto ooh

[Verse 1: Vernon]
Since when has everything become impossible
Everything I look at feel like they’re closer
(close to me)
Even more than thanksgiving holidays
Firstly, as I got more famous
People applaud me even if I just took a shit
But the cheap shit I put down became first place
(how many times has it already been)

If I can say so myself
HVC aka Vernon, memorise it
19980218 is the lucky number
The formula for mula
More mula, more mula
My words are just as they are
What more are you asking
Stop with the bullshit ‘bout
Whether Vernon fake or nah
I still haven’t shown one degree
No matter what you say for a long time fuck off
You confidently walk on my road no doubt
A musty smell comes out of your mouths
Everyone is leaving me
I let you gargle with Albothyl

Everybody’s just wannabe shit
As you can see I’m too fly
They buzz light years away from me
Toy Story shit
Even after listening for 20 years
They’ll remain as masterpieces bruh
See how much I’ve gone up after one year

[Hook: Vernon]
Now I’m on my way to whatever’s waitin’
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Fuck what they’d be talkin’ ‘bout (fuck they talkin’ ‘bout)
Their opinion doesn’t count, like ooh
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Yes sir without a doubt
2015 is the lotto number, like ooh
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto
Lotto lotto lotto lotto ooh

[Verse 2: Don Mills]
See hear feel
Truthfully, I erased my memories
What I’ve seen, I’ve heard and I’ve felt
Tomorrow’s easier than drinking water
I hang on shiny necklaces
I walk the streets everyday like a beggar
And I talk on stage with my voice loud and resonant
Calm down like gentleman
You should walk here it’s a better way
For headaches it’s good to eat medicine
You’re supposed to eat it, your friends are going to marry
So better hustle harder
Everyone knows fashion grab your unstable heart
Holla at me girl
Do you annoy people because you like it?

Sitting limit, 30 minute
So I can bring some dirty money
Nu era fitted, you cannot fit in
So I brought some skunky DJ feel it
I chose a good destination
Watch where I’m going to end up
You can look carefully if you have interest in me
You can be of help
Tell me I’m doing crazy things
Even when I pretend I’m fine
Later I’m going to have a good car, and a good house
Right now a bus and my mom’s home

[Hook: Vernon]
Now I’m on my way to whatever’s waitin’
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Fuck what they’d be talkin’ ‘bout (fuck they talkin’ ‘bout)
Their opinion doesn’t count, like ooh
Whatever happens go straight (go straight)
Yes sir without a doubt
2015 is the lotto number, like ooh
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto lotto, feels like
The lotto the lotto
Lotto lotto lotto lotto ooh
