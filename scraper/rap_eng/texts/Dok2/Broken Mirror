It’s true, in this life
I’ve never been the one
In your eyes
I’ve never been the truth
All you saw, was a broken mirror

[Verse 1: Gonzo]
Knowing all my luck, so damaged
Thinking ‘god damnit’
Pen ain’t moving, rhymes is so average
All of my life I felt so embarrassed
Anxious, insecure, and so careless
Selfish, fucking over my parents
Trading my time to hang with these parrots
Wasn’t til I saw that view on that terrace
Living in Peru, found out what true fear is
Wasn’t til I lost it all and hit bottom
Chasing that base to bury my problems
Lacing my blunts so I could see angels
Munching that mush, too much, got too dangerous
Everyday the same, spot and night trains
Ambien to sleep, blow to stay awake
I’m turned into a freak, in love with mary jane
Only dame I still want around after I came
But maybe its my fate, cursed by this disease
Higher than the fucking birds and the bees
Should I tie myself a knot, should I squeeze?
Should I cop myself a Glock or nin’?
Cop a ball, end it all in a breeze
Couldn’t see myself at 30 living clean
Til I, realized that I’m blessed, i’ll be fine
Long as I never go back to that pretty little line

[Verse 2: CGB]
Yo, I just slept for the first time in 3 days
Better than nothing right?
Watch the sun go up as I sit n I blaze
Contemplating life
Like shit can I really fucking make it?
I'm not tryna fake it, worked too hard to get mistaken
And I gotta get my cut, the percentage is what I'm taking
My heart, well it's been aching
It's you that loves to break it
Telling me I’m wasted, yelling at me faded
Nevermind, I'm jaded, never should have waited
Heart feels isolated, separated and basic
Hard to feel awakened, operate the hatred
Who's this monster I've created? Lord tell me
Tell me who the fuck I've become
I had no insecurities and now I got plenty
Told my girl break my heart gently if you gonna do it
She said “fuck you and you foolish”
Why you always act so clueless?
Girl, you know what I been doing
I’m just tryna touch on your tulips
Young flower, yes, are you blooming?
Do I got your brain going and your hips moving?
Do I got ya heart pumping, baby, let's do it
You off of the pills and I'm off of the syrup
We fucked up
