Friday night, 10:30
Tomorrow I have no work
A small room, you and me
The phones are turned off
We don’t rush, never
We have time (shh)
You don’t need to talk
You can do as you feel, it’s okay
You’re beautiful, beautiful
At the place my stare stops, baby
You’re so beautiful to me, girl
Your stare is at the same place as mine, yeah

I love it and I like it
The thick applied lipstick on your lips
You love it and you like it
When I unbutton my shirt

Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love
Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love

You are biting your lips
Even if I don’t ask you
Tell me everything
We don’t need the nervousness so let your hand down
You are immersed in me
Show me yourself

Oh, ba-bay eyes meet
The heartbeat
Makes big vibrations
The breathing fills with music sounds
I pull you and hug you oh

I love it and I like it
Messy traces everywhere
You love it and you like it
Sweating, feeling slackness

Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love
Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love

Yes, you know better than anyone
What I like, uh
Yes, I know better than anyone else
What you like
There is no need for hesitations
There is no time to notice
So right now
Let’s fly far away
To that high place only me and you know of
Hold tight, so that you won’t let my body
Fill it up so there is no room
Yes call me anytime when you need me
The moment you call me, I am in front of your house
Kiss me and I’ll love it
Just tease me and I’ll love it
Flow with me and I love it girl

I love it and I like it
Short hair
Even the dots under the eye

I want nobody
But you baby
This scattering time we become one

Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love
Making love and love and I love it
Making love and love and we make love
