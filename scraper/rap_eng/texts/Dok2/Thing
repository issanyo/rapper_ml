[Hook: Tino]
Smokin' for two and I'm lifted
Drinkin' for two and I'm feelin it
Prayin' to god that I make it
You know I'm doing my thing
Girl I been doing my thing
I hope that we make it
I can no longer take it
I can no longer fake it
Keep doing your thing
Girl just keep doing your thing
Moving that body, that body so thick
I just been doing my thing
I just been doing my thing
Girl keep on doing your thing
Girl just keep doing that thing
Girl keep moving that thing

[Verse 1: CGB]
Loved the way this chick got down with it
Looked in her eyes
Asked 'is you down widdit?'
Yes baby, keep telling you I could be your lady
Shit baby, I ain't really know if I'm ready for that
Fell for this chick and she fell right back
Seemed to think, I got played like a trick
3 times so I'm asking where the fucks is the hats?
Back, back, back when I was motherfuckin nothin'
According to you I'm still nothin'
Catchin' feelings, I ain't frontin'
And this hoe got me feeling something
And I can't contain it, sorry for complaining
Tired of feeling broken
Told you that I hate it
And it all, gotta come right back to this chick
Back to this bitch
Let's get back to basics
Get it

[Hook: Tino]
Smokin' for two and I'm lifted
Drinkin' for two and I'm feelin it
Prayin' to god that I make it
You know I'm doing my thing
Girl I been doing my thing
I hope that we make it
I can no longer take it
I can no longer fake it
Keep doing your thing
Girl just keep doing your thing
Moving that body, that body so thick
I just been doing my thing
I just been doing my thing
Girl keep on doing your thing
Girl just keep doing that thing
Girl keep moving that thing

[Verse 2: Gonzo]
You hate it when I'm faded
Always gotta use, abuse until the veins bruise
I'm numb, I feel jaded
You refuse to see me like this
You just cannot take it
Baby please don't you be shy, speak up ya mind
Go on now, girl, say it
Cause I know that's some shit
You been wanting off ya chest for a long time
You hold me down, you clean my wounds
I fuck around, I eat them shrooms and forget you
I trip so hard, go full retard, I fuck them broads
I pop them bars, and forget you
I hurt you over, over again
We ain't friends, but at least we pretend
I can't let you, leave my life
I need you right? Right by side
Thought I'd be the guy to protect you?

[Hook: Tino]
Smokin' for two and I'm lifted
Drinkin' for two and I'm feelin it
Prayin' to god that I make it
You know I'm doing my thing
Girl I been doing my thing
I hope that we make it
I can no longer take it
I can no longer fake it
Keep doing your thing
Girl just keep doing your thing
Moving that body, that body so thick
I just been doing my thing
I just been doing my thing
Girl keep on doing your thing
Girl just keep doing that thing
Girl keep moving that thing
