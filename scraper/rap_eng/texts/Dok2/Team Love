[Verse 1: Gonzo]
Bunch of lost memories
But always new thoughts
I try to run from love
But I always get caught
Uh
You are the candy to my eyes
My dreams in disguise
Valentine to be mine
Yeah
But for I'm sticking with my crew
No matter what we always find a way to get through
Yeah
Crew love is the strongest
And GSW is the crew that I always belong with
Uh
People taking lives
Life taking lives
Human Beings taking different risks to survive
Ups and Downs
Smiles and Frowns
Been trying to take my luck
And turn it around
And I admit
Its hard for me to swallow my pride
Been through hell and back
With no one on my side
Uh
Crew love is what I believe in
Never gonna stop
Guess I'm over achieving

I look at the stars for some projection
I gaze at the sky just to give me some direction
They waiting for us to fall
But we'll never
Bros 4 life
GSW forever
