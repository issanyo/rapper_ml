Verse 1: (GonZo)
A young bachelor on a budget, man I love it
Pulling pot out of my pockets, might rock it or roll it
As I'm strolling with a blunt lit, feeling like a figment
Of my own imagination, penetrating the radio station
I got the stereo blazing with the fire I'm raising
It's amazing, facing the haze until the days end
Just another bend, now we back again
Cause that's how it goes, up in the smoke
From the ash I awoke, I brush that shit off my chest
I'm blessed and ready to wrestle with today's test
I write text, cause I know that I'm up next
So sign the check, I might balance ya with the ballets bruh
That's my talent and now you know
I blow and bellow this mellow melody
I'm bout to be bigger than Hello Kitty
It's GonZo and I never spit it shitty
From a city you have never heard of, but life changes quickly
So I move swiftly and give thee unto you
My curse in this verse that lets me know what to do
Cause I've been through some pain, and I know you have too
So I keep sipping my brew
Making these tunes with the Luminous Crew
Letting our light shine through
This is... This is what we do

Hook: (GonZo, Laozi, Chief Tweak)
Keep it rolling, rolling, rolling to this irie music
Mind is open, open, open, yeah we highly lucid
Getchu zoning, zoning, zoning, keep ya vibing to it
LS is lightly stupid, stupid, stupid
X2

Verse 2: (Laozi)
I'm hella faded, been facing blunts
My mental state is sedated dunce
Stay medicated, getting elevated
Everyday is just a vacay for us
Complaints are just a waste of breath
Taste the rainbow, embrace your death
Face your flesh and replace your stress
Cause one day you'll decay and erase your debt
Cool as the frost on the chilliest nug, yea I be that
Schooling the boss, I'm the illest of plugs for the weed sack
Hit me back when you need that
Detrimentally sentimental when it's L related
Celebrated as the only angel that Hell evaded
Developed a brain and got educated
I levitated, see me rise like an apparition
Pass spliffs with my click till we catch a vision
That's the mission: rap position
Drop lines like these cats is fishing
Don't bite the bait or hate the game
Can't fight your fate so why wait for change
Time wasted sayin ya gunna break the chains
Ain't shit if you sittin tryna place the blame
So spark the weed and please pardon me
For harming beats when I start to speak
With sharpened teeth, the most armored Greek
Or hardest Spartan couldn't spar with me
Mentally nor physically
I'm meant to be a sick emcee
Depending on my destiny
Potentially the best that's ever blessed a beat
Incense burning, in a sense yearning
For innocence and learning ever since I heard a sermon
Intelligence turned to ignorance amid insects and vermin
Living independent can be such an essential burden
I stress the working
Push the pen to pad till end is certain
And can never remember my verses when I rehearse em
It's a curse man, but hey, I'm still
One of the best
Coming for vets with a gun under vest
Stunning the rest with this wondrous mess
Sun in my chest, puffing blunts till I'm utterly blessed
YES!

Verse 3: (Chief Tweak)
Once upon a time I was flipping through the pages of my mind, Just tryna see what I could find
And I came across a page that said I'm one of a kind
And that I could shine and bring light to my brothers
If you wanna see good, well be your kindest to others
Cause we all need each other in this world of hate
I mean when's the last time you did something great?
Well shit, you might as well try before it gets too late
So let's eliminate the hatred and all the negativity
Strive for something great kid, like life longevity
Cause existing is heavenly as long as you let it be
You think I'm gunna let me ego take over me?
If so I'm gunna have to say you're wrong
But surely you can tag along while we rip the bong
Ya might gain some insight to what's right or what's wrong
Plus the more the merrier just like the holidays
Yeah, just like the holidays
This is what we do, we're doing it in all ways
