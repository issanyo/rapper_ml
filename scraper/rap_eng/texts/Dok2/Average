[Verse 1: Gonzo]

I'm in deep thought at the Panda Express
Ink in my vest and on my arms because there's pain in my chest
I'm nothing less than average
Average, average
I smoked the cabbage a bit, then shaved my fuckin' arm pits
I walked a mile or two with a tied noose on my tits
I guess I'm average and shit
Average, average, average, average
I don't know 'bout you
There's crayon gang signs on my shoes
Now tell me what does that mean
Head to the church with neon beams
And let go

[Verse 2: Lord Sizzle]

I hope I die today
The soap is tried today
A mechanism to cope has floated its rights away
I'm many types today
Time's feeling light today
A mechanism to write the rights and the wrongs away
I hope I live forever
The rope has sold me never
A mechanism to choke with just a flick of lever
I hope I die today
The soap is tried today
A mechanism to fuck me, choke me, I'm boxed forever
I'm black and white stripes starting to ripe
Bible study got me praying for bitches that want the pipe
But what I might do is cite two verses for fake assurance
Symbol down in the oil, my inner friend wants to burn this
Motherfucker with everyone in it, I'm losing minutes
By planning, tired of standing with hands tied on my dimples
Simpletons not attentive, I'm tempted to crack your temples
You don't need it, and that bullshit? You don't feed it
It's slow-seeded
Shit's beaded between your beads, you ain't bleeding
You're breathing but not for you, we ain't even
Unmasked demons, matter of fact: we mass demons
We grass-eating, stash keeping as ash beings
Half Reese's dided between the equals
Cookies and cream the Hershey
Oh brother, this is the sequel
Regals whipping the eagle
Eagles doing that dirt
Beatle dead on the bootheel
Our duty is just dessert
