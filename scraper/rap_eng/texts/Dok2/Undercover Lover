First time I met you, I could not forget you
Playing on like my favorite song
And it goes on and on and on
Reminiscing the time that I left you
You were getting down
And you were drinking Crown
You were dancing slow
You start to lose control
But you you got to understand
Please hush, hush darling
There she goes, staring as she’s walking
Moving slow, eyes doing the talking
Don’t you know you appeal to me so
Can’t let this get out of control
So give me your touch
Give me your kiss and hugs
No one needs to know about this loving
For real, I’m telling you the deal
A heart is nothing you can easily steal
They way you rub me down
Way you caress me down
Way you love me down
Say you’re the best around
So hush, me say hush darling
No needs to know about us, so hush darling
Girl you’re my undercover lover
You’re my undercover lover
So keep it on the low
No one needs to know
Well lady, lately
It’s the feeling I got
Slower babe, I think it’s time we pick it up
You’re far away
And I’m feeling like I’m stuck
But when we get together babe
You’re my one stop shop
They way you rub me down
Way you caress me down
Way you love me down
Say you’re the best around
So hush, me say hush darling
No needs to know about us, so hush darling
