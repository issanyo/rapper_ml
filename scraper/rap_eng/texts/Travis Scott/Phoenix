[Verse 1]
Funny things is changing now we out of here
Ain't shit the same but Jason I'll admit
Seen my mama in pain she cried a hundred tears
So fucking tired so fucking many nights it got so hot in there
So tonight we at the time nigga blow them candles mane
Cause when its time to shine no need for candles mane
We some cocky niggas in the rocky niggas
Rocking dolo Will & Rich in here we from the traffic nigga
See the problem is yeah, we too proud of this
Now-now, the problem is, too many columns is anonymous
We too proper nigga get a prop for this
And we can take a trip to Karen nigga get a shot of this
Dodge a copper-opper cab will give a shit
Go to class but not for the scholarship
Here's a different scholar she a dolly pouter
Here's a problem with my holy grail, ain't got no holy water
I'm too slonky, Tony hates this part about it
When the keys roll up the car, you can roll if you with it yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That shit is wack, them niggas in the mall they sellin'
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla

[Verse 2]
Candy be keep tapping that hoe, we hopping that area code
Somehow, if they figure that Harry and Mary are bros
They end up just rocking the tote
Circles around, you be calling up everything gold
Them niggas is southerners niggas be rapping and popping
Not give a fuck about those
The same ones giving me 5, is seeing me live
The girl they chilling beside, be giving me sage
She been tripping all night, thinking 'bout moving them boobies aside
Sneak in and out of the crib
But definitely, Holly committed to giving me rights

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror, on the wall, who the freshest of em all? Tell em
That shit is wack, them niggas in the mall they sellin'
Think about it, she stay in the Margiela
Trippy done slip on the floor, bout 4 of my bros
Stepping these hoes, vanilla
