Hop outta bed, look in the mirror
Now I'm 'bout to get some face
Watch  my face
Like, yeah, I'm cute, yeah motherfucker, yeah I know

Put in my eyes, now my outlook seein' straight
Light up the iPhone
Read the texts from the females
I was textin' late, last night
Hey, Travis $cott
Tell me whatcha gettin' in today
(Might gonna be hype, I'm rollin' up (unknown))
Man, I gotta get out
Put my sweat shirt on
Ever since I got off my ex
I been feelin oh, so strong
Partyin' like all night long
Wash my glasses
And then break it off
Reflectin' off, wit a Sunny D
Bee hive, pick ya best
It's watchin' the wind blow
All on trees
Ashes to ashes, as the fire passes
She lookin' like Molasses
Call me yo sugar, sugar

I'll do and die
Yeah, call me yo sugar, sugar, babe
You look so sweet
Cinnamon mixed with Swisher
I'm a zombie babe, but don't mind my thriller, filler
Just influenced this check into a killer
Babe, I know what you want, Imma get you what you like
Who's bad, who's bad, it's not my fault that I wanna be like Mike
Yeah, I want that limelight
Yeah, that contract with Sprite
Mix it in with different people
Never say never, unless you up in never land, hangin' out wit (unknown)
I like interracial
My girl has a white facial
After all this, I do not know what my day holds

Can we learn, tonight?

Built only from da hood

Where your trunk, just check my hood
And flow the sheets, complex to get a vibe
