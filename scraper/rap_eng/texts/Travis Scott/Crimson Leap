Our first kiss in the living room
That's a hella way to end a night
A hella way to end a night
We did drugs in the bedroom
That's a hella way to end a night
A hella way to end a night

She caught me fucking up again, I don't know why she's still surprised
You weren't ever perfect, nor was she, nor was I
I know you fucked that nigga at that party last night
She said that her sins can be fully justified
“I had a couple drinks and I wasn't alright
I was really drunk”, so I said, “I was really high”
We were lipsing that night though we had issues that night
It turned up when she swallowed all my children that night
But then the bitches replied saying, “I'll see you tonight”
It wasn't pretty cause she broke the first dishes that night
I lost my missus that night but gain a mistress that night
My motivation? All my niggas linking that night
We were supposed to be sharing our holy body and holy blood
But instead I had a holey body with lots of blood
She jumped at the chance to see me weak
You might call it a crimson leap
“Mmmmm whatcha sayyy
Does this shit happen everyday?
I saw your first face at the Christmas party
It’s funny how you changed
I stuck with you everyday
And all the funny bullshit that you said
You know what homie? You can keep your flowers
Cause I don't need a man when I got girl power
I got 99 problems and your bullshit's adding on
I hope you realise that maybe you were wrong
Maybe you shouldn't have fucked with this
Gained my trust only to fuck my best friend
You ain't shit homie, I mean you used to be sweet
But now I know its lies, it’s kinda funny to me
And yeah, I'd love to see you weak
But what kind of name is Crimson Leap?”

We did drugs in the bedroom
That's a hella way to end a night
A hella way to end a night
Then she caught me fucking in the bathroom
Rubbers all over the bathroom
That's a hella way to end a night
Tonight, tonight

She caught loving her again, I don't know why she's still surprised
I tell her everyday that “I fucking love her eyes”
She makes me feel good, so happy I could die
And the funny thing is she doesn't realise
That I'd kill Osama for her
Even go as far as killing Obama for her
I’d take a bullet for her
It sounds mad but that's my affection for her
Have you ever had someone to hold?
In the December to February colds?
Have you ever in your life been told?
“You're the type to with whom I can grow old?”
Oh, that's such a humbling feeling
Even if you break my heart, baby, time can heal it
But these are normal feelings
Old loves will always have the deepest meanings

I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I wasn't of my head, all my niggas is dead
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I wasn't of my head, all my niggas is dead
Oh it's a hell of a night
It's a hell of a night
