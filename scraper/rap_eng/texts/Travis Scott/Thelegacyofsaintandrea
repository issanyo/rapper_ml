Thelegacyofsaintandrea vol 1 feat T.Mac
Part 1


All of my demons drowning in the blood of Jesus
How much a dollar really cost
Thoughts drowning through visualizations
Disbelief, losing all for a 3 stroke leaf
Visuals floating in my head as I speak
Good or evil  I know my soul is weak
Artists saying big words and acting lyrical, my bars and flow historical and maybe even biblical
Earth is hell and I dont mean that hyperbolic
A couple of narcotics in a table
Demons battling like Cain and able this is not a fable, battling for cable
Brotherhood ain't always that good
Shit niggas beefing with you for shit you ain't even do
Real friends start trends and forget about the benz
Money is the root to all evil
Differentiating fake and real
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Segregation consistently turns to being a menace to our nation
My lyricism is like an exorcism
Extraterrestrial even surreal
It's hard to tell how I feel
Using vivid imagery to paint a picture with picasso vision
Hyperventilating throughout the process of meditation
Has easily become a necessity
The legacy of Saint Andrea has officially begun
All imagery of gun violence comes to mind thinking of world silence
Misconceptions in adolescents
We call it the art of peer pressure
A couple of niggas
In the process of miscommunication, consuming stimulants for attention

Verse 1:
Heart Feels like there's real talent/pump Pinnochio, I'm a feel addict/ I'm just tryna resonateeeee, no Jappeto and I'm still at it/ (on beat) no strings attached/ I won't get caught up in that/ heartbeat but there ain't a trap/ snap/ maybe we'll pick up the map/ navigate straight through the rap/ open up my mind, star dust as I shoot for the stars/ start trust-ing the view as it comes / gotta drink faith/ gotta show face/ cause when the card's dealt/ you're gon' feel compelled/ to act what's felt/ and there's no way/ wavy with it/ beach water with the way I'm spitting/ real flow-er, no fugazi with it/ lazyily hit it/ listen to the way I give it/ self love will help you raise the limit (switch up)/ Distant figures/ black/ on the back/track/ when I search for memories missing/ I figured/ I couldn't get them/ they're out of reach; middle fingers trying to interlock/ but the tip/ clips/ the skin/ then slips/ back the lock/ we flocks because we're fly/ and fly because we fleece/ like sheep/ trying to cover the wolf that's underneath/ but I see through/ the mask, and I see you/ dancing on the thick rimmed glasses I see through/ confused me before- but my concentration, now, is the real juice/ I drink it and I'm lead to the real truth/ killed by your pride, and the downfall that you had is the real proof/ drowning in the sea of your deep blue/ because it go/ Halley Berry, I'm coming to yeh/ I chose my poison and it's talking to meh/ sip it slowly through the conversation/ and as I fall through the floor my smile is ever crooked

Verse 2:
A broken painting, the pastels all on the floor/ davinchi code/ the canvas is pouring blood on the floor/ you sold your soul/ in order to master your artistry/ and I had to paint the picture to show you why hearts could bleed/ so woe is me/ tears of poetry/ turned into rivers of living water you know it's me/ drink from the chalice, a thousand deaths is the potency (drink from the chalice, a thousand deaths is the potency)/ opposite thoughts, I figured your speech had a quote from me/ and all I could say, with the air pressed at the top of my lungs,/ the press, impressed by who they wanted me to become/ a slight utterence- erring on the edge of defeat/ the foot I felt on my neck had started to flee/ and so I stood up and attempted to pallet the probability/ tentative that probable cause painted the death of me/and for the code? Well, let's just say I read a book about protection from my enemies

Saintandrea part 2

Lately I been withdrawing from infatuation
In the process of minor persuasions, ducking from the revelations
This shit a deep penetration
Take me to the deepest process of ventilation
Home invasions
Er body wanna enter heaven but not er body wanna die
Mob ties, bad guys, swimming in a  pool of lies
New years resolutions, to end all of the pollution
Struggling to pay tuition, a young nigga with ambitions stirring the wheel swtching off the ignition
Switching from top positions to all time lows receiving all the blows
Leaving all the hoes for one
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Perception is key, fall behind the skeleton they believe I'm blind
Rarely sleeping, turning off the blinds
Being successful turning to being neglectful
Capitalism taught me how to hate, placing a facade
Contemplation turning to meditation maybe even affiliation
Polital candidates misusing their Influence
Brainwashing the audience
Mean no offense
Married to the gain no need to refrain, gold chains same lane
No games
I'm born black ain't shit I can do
Makin a nigga feel like shit was my choice
Singing in sweet rejoice, never being appreciated
Unless all of us are free, none of us will be free
Young nigga on the rise I'm a born winner
Hustlin hard and playing the game I ain't no quitter
I left from the bank like this shit is so goofy
You know I'm steady chilling man I'm all Gucci
I can pull strings, I'm partly acoustic
I spit live rounds that could even decorate a vest
Yeah I am the best
Saint Andrea player you know how the game is
