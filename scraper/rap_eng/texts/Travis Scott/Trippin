[Chorus: Travis Scott & Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, aww, shit
All my niggas chillin' in the VIP
Poppin' bottles, you can't have a sip
Smokin' loud, you can't have a hit
Damn, aww, shit
All my niggas chillin' in the VIP (hahahahaha)
Poppin' bottles, you can't have a sip (uh)
Smokin' loud, you can't have a hit (yup)

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
All my niggas trippin' off the shits (ayy, ayy)
All my niggas down to break a bitch (ayy, ayy)
All my niggas rollin' out the planes (ayy, ayy)
All my niggas smokin' up they whip (yeah, yeah)
I'ma about my dollars, 'bout my chips (yeah, yeah)
I'ma take her home and give her dick (yeah, yeah)
I'm on marijuana, hit my phone up
If you wanna hit this Kush and be a goner (be a goner)
Certified player with my section see them ballers (see them ballers)
KK in the air, tell the waitress bring them bottles
And I don't mind sharing, your bitch helpin' us drink all this
I pull up in a hotbox, I'm stuntin' now and I don't even park it
They jaws droppin' like

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Wiz Khalifa]
Damn (woo), aww, shit (shit)
All my niggas chillin' in the VIP (ho)
Poppin' bottles, you can't have a sip (can't have none of this shit, man)
Smokin' loud, you can't have a hit ([?], where we at?)
Damn, aww, shit (oh, fuck)
All my niggas chillin' in the VIP (hahahahaha)
Poppin' bottles, you can't have a sip (nothin')
Smokin' loud, you can't have a hit (ha)
