[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave, just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' ride for me

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Yeah, thought you gon' ride for me
You my little Tesla V (skrrt, skrrt)
Spent that hunnid on the chief, that's how much I believe
Uh, every day Halloween (alright) but we don't trick and treat
Count deads in my dreams (cash), can't even fall asleep (yah)
Pop on ya, send the opps on ya (pop it, pop it)
Hollow clips in magazines
RoboCops on ya, raining shots on ya
Drop your top off with that bean
Mix it one-handed, please (it's lit), mix it right, dirty tea
It's only gonna bring me peace (straight up)
Don't leave my cup, that's for me

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (what)
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
And you say that you gonâ€™ ride with me
