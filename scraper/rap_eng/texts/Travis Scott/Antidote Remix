I got my blinders on
I use tunnel vision
My eye on the prize

My big vision
To be on ya flat screen television
Doesn't matter the size

But I want mines at a hundred inch
Nigga tryna dine
Do you want a dish?

Eatin' on my mind
I ain't talkin' grits
Yet bread over shine make a lot of since

Make it off of grind
Make it off of hits
Make it off of crime "Take another hit"

Nigga when I rhyme
You can trust in it
I don't say these lines for the fuck of it

This is where shit gets real
It ain't for every ear canal
It's a custom fit

We take the risk of jail
The princ-a-pal never tell
Regardless the numbers you get

Come from where it's hard to come up and shit
Shit it's hard enough to come up with the rent
So we go hard to come up from the blend
But tryna get the paper might come with the pen

Need to slow down a bit
Boy how it sound to flip
Then bags, now a brick

Everything round you lit
Them don't like sound of it
Keep you round a clip

They say it's never no gain with no pain
No sunshine with no rain
With that said, it's hard to keep self drive
But where there's no way, you make lane

I made noodles out of Roman
Stay low like water down drain
When shit get hairy and they do dirty
I cut them off against grain

Road to riches will drive you insane
So I ride the track, come hop on my train
Curt LAISI the name and the meanings dope
So please don't take it in vein

Shit, you might overdose
Them dudes may pose a hoax
Meaning they ain't real like wrestling
But I don't worry I know the ropes

I can spar in any arena
I think BIG because I'm a dreamer
All I ever wanted was my price down
So all my bread and my team up

Gotta dodge all hospital procedures
Plus dodge the law and killers who'll leave us
Have you in awe how much could defeat us
Step through the smog in my Shell Toe Adidas

Try clouding my vision
But can't deceive us
Try acting like they don't
But know they need us

Why you give those looks
We're born to be crooks
We're not open books
So no way you can read us
I told you we leaders!

I told you we leaders
I told you we leaders...Yeah!
