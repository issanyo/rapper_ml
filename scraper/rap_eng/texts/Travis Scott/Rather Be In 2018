[Intro: Offset]
Magnifico, arriba
Magnifico, arriba, arriba

(Zane, Zane, Zane, Zane)

[Verse 1: Offset & Quavo]
Trapping like the narco (Narco)
Got dope like Pablo (Pablo)
Cut throat like Pablo (Cut throat)
Chop trees with the Draco (Draco)
On the Nawf, got Diego (Diego)
Say "Hasta luego" (Luego)
Muy Bien wrap a kilo (Yeah)
Snub nose with potato

(Run that back, Turbo)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Fives galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
(Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew)

[Chorus: Lil Pump]
You're such a f******, I love it (I love it)
You're such a f******, I love it (I love it)
You're such a *****, I love it (Love it, love it)
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (Dork)
(Some-Some-Some-Someone said)
(McLovin; ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge: Big Hawk, Swae Lee Lil Pump ]

Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak
I just pulled up in a Ghost (To win the retreat, we all in too deep)
***** that  ***** up out in London (Up out in)
Then I  ***** up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (Uh-uh, woo)
And my ***** gettin' ignorant (we all in too deep)
Like a lighter, *****, we ignant (Ignant, yeah)
Muy Bien wrap a kilo (Yeah) (Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps)
Snub nose with potato (don't play us for weak)
So much diamonds on my bust down

[Verse 3: Drake]

The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie (i love it)
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a ****

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hey, cold gang with the cocaine (Coke)
(I'm a sick I Like a quick)
The more money make more rain (Rain)
(I'm a sick I Like a quick)
Pourin' up a pint while I'm baggin' propane (Baggin')
(I'm a sick I Like a quick)
Point blank range give a nigga nose rings (Yes)
Skip to my lou with a pack in the cat (Cat)
Jiffy, Lube, where the bricks where they at? (Where)
Dripping, ooze, the Patek all wet (Ooh)
(How you start a family? The condom slipped up)

The birds in the trap, they ain't leavin' out they nest (Brr)

Yup, runnin' with the pack got slept (Yeah)
Hands in the cookie jar, cut his finger off (Ah)
Nigga bein' greedy, we gon' cut his tummy out (Huh)
Hundred bricks on the roads, took a couple routes (Bricks)
