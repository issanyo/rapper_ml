[Intro]

It's a new song, I'ma let you hear a little bit
Play it

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why

[Refrain: Young Thug]
Who you loyal to?
Me or us?
Who you trust the most?
Me or us?
Who you wanna fuck every night?
Me or us?
Who you wanna take on your flight?
Me or us?

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Ow
You the one that said you were doin' it
And you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it
You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin'
What would you do?
If your brother left you, what would you do?
If them niggas came for you, you better pursue (watch out)
I just spent ten racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue
Oops, I meant Dupree, jewelry sitting on A/C
Yeah, yeah, yeah (hmmmm)
I wanna know, tell me, lil' baby, I wanna know
I wanna know
I got the show, fuck my show, be my show (what?)
I got them loafs, I'm with Metro, he got some more (yeah) (he got some more)
I don't gotta talk, look at my jewelry, it can say more, hey (say more)
You smoke that kushy, man, I'm so goody, I want some cookies
Fuck on your daughter, fuck on my brother, now she gon' diss you
I got them racks, I was just buyin', you was just lookin'
I bought her diamonds and she just smilin', she think she's tooken
But, this for the love of my fans (hmmmm)
I'm smokin' pot while in Japan (hmmmm)
Blacker the berry, drink my cran
Bae, you dig it and I'm the sand (dig)

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spotlights, it's 'bout time
Some of the time, I try
Some of the time, I try
Spotlights, spotlights on
Spotlights every time I drive
Spotlights every time I drive

[Chorus: Young Thug & Travis Scott]
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why (why)
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why (hmmmm)
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why (oooooooooh)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Spotlights every time I try
Spotlights every time I try
I try, I try
Diamonds on me
Diamonds on me dancin'
Sometimes in plastic
I live life in plastic
I live life in plastic
So drastic, live life in plastic
Live life in plastic, plastic

[Bridge: Travis Scott & Young Thug]
Yeah, plastic in that (ow)
Coated, leather, tatted, trashed it
Savage bastard and it's magic
Masses gonna redbone, brightest (ow)
Fattest blunt, somehow it ended
Drastic, fuck it, red-light, drunk, whip it
Dramatic forty, drastic, fuck it (ow)
Oh, drastic, fuck me

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
She know she give me what she love
I push that button, now she go
She said to wipe a nigga nose (ow)
With that big-body Benz, I need beneficial friends
I learned my synonyms, I put ice in my rims
I got a brown girl, I'm 'bout to call her, "Timbs"
She went from lesbian to me 'cause she know I got M's (ow)
I had some RMs, I gave that to my partner and 'em

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why
Well, this is why-a-why-a-why
