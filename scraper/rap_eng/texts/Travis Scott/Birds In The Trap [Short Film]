Travis gets a hotdog from hotdog stand, drives off and
Gets in a car accident

Playing instrumental to "the ends"

Travis: Spoken
Dimness, my old brother
I can feel whispers flying over endless rain of meaningless chaos
Reality always exceed fiction
I can see an unborn generation
I can hear within the silence and see within the nothingness
Flashing neon lights trying to disturb and throw off my fucking judgment
Past, present, and future all melted in a nonending circle
Hear my words of temptation and redemption
They made me believe I could escape
Remember this shit, remember me, the one who die here
It's time to live

Playing "coordinate"

Travis steps off the roof of an abandoned building to be found on the ground of an abandoned construction site

Playing "the ends"
