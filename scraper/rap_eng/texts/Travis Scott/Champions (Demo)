[Intro]
Yeah, straight up

[Chorus]
1500, all in singles
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
1500, all in singles (straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
... we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
1500, all in singles (straight up)
Throw it up, watch it fall and drop
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
Champions, we run the city
Number one, they fallin' from the top
'Round and 'round they go
'Round and 'round they go
