Yeah, woah, drop a six, make me trip (it's lit)
Woah, for my dawg, hit a lick (straight up)

[Verse 1: Blac Youngsta & Travis Scott]
I won't forget how they shitted on me (ooh)
How they quitted on me (ayy, ah-ah, ooh)
Uh, uh, uh
All these hundreds on me
I be runnin' to that money, nothin' but gunnas 'round me
I be runnin' with them gunnas (straight up, it's lit)
Fuck it up, bitch called my phone trippin', I hung up

Everybody 'round me gettin' some money
I'll slide out for my dawgs, and I'm sellin' dope 'til the Sun up

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta & Travis Scott]
Wrist, Patek, 40 layin' on the set
I eat, you eat, told my nigga we gon' eat
I ain't gotta stand in front of grandma's house
And sell dope 'cross the street no more
Shout out everybody who ever hated on me
Or turned their back on me before
Fire shots, I'ma fire back (uh)
Lie to me, I'ma lie back (uh)
Two wrongs don't make a right
I don't give a fuck about that
Uh, uh, uh, uh
They mad 'cause I'm rich (uh, uh)
I might go and fuck my hater's bitch
Whole lot of ice on my wrist (yeah)
For my dawg, I'll hit a lick

[Refrain: Travis Scott]
And I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
I'm glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you
Glad I found you

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah (ayy), drop a six, make me trip (it's lit)
Woah, for my dawg, hit a lick (straight up)
Woah, Heavy Camp with the clique (alright)
Woah
Uh, uh, uh, Juvenile off the mix (yah)
Ayy, break it down, make it dip (yeah-eah)
Ayy, off top, off the rip (yeah-eah)
Ayy
