[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
I'm smokin' double pack, Louis duffle bag, get that money stack
Trouble's back, I don't give a fuck, we jump out the back
Where they at? Leave all of my essentials in a zig-zag
Roll it up, take a drag, I'm the best at it, I don't like to brag
Leave my body in a bag
If you fuck around you in that body bag, burn the flag
Fuck who you know, I don't fuck with that
Couple zeros on a couple tags
Tunnel vision, tunnelin' a jag
Stumble out the hotel lobby
Shoveled gold knuckles, screaming where they at?
I won't be in your life again but you might see me in a mag'
Delete my number, never call me back
Flat on the ground, spat blood on my Acronym bag
We from Stocktown, seasons change
Bitch, you know where we at

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Let's get real, land of the ghost, so trill
Come and take a trip in my hill, get ghost
Don't come up here with that shit, get roast
Know La Flame don't play by his toast, you know
And I'm bound to flow you down, come on, she grab my jeans
She grab the kush, she balancing on my balance beam
While I'm jigglin' cantaloupes
We off that lean, lean, lean in my dream, dream, dream, dreams, yeah
We don't want alcohol drinks, only soda and codeine
Get it right, get it right
It ain't down for the night, it ain't down for the night
Ayy, yo yo yo yo yo yo, Lean, where these bitches come from?
Tryna see who with the shits, who really down to get drunk
I might throw up, might turn up, turn up of every summer, every summer

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Of every summer, every summer
I'm with sad boys in Stockholm they know H-town be my home
They know H-Town be my home
Them, them my homies, them, them my homies
I'm with Sad Boys in Stockholm
They know Mo City my home
Them, them my homies, them, them my homies
Them them my motherfucking homies
(Straight up)

[Chorus: Yung Lean & Travis Scott]
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE (every summer, every summer)
I don't give a fuck about no one except me
I'm with sad boys in Stockholm, they know H-town be my home
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck (they know H-town be my home) about no one except Lean
Them them my homies
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
Them them my homies
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
I'm with sad boys in Stockholm, they know Mo City my home
Stocktown, Ghost town, SBE
I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean
Them them my
