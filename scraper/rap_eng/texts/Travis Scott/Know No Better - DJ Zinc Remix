[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better (know no better)
'Cause, baby, I know you better
'Cause, baby, I know no better
Baby, I know you better (baby, I know...)
Baby, I know you better

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Know you better
Ooh, baby, no, no, no, no, no, no
Know you better
(Baby, I know)
Baby, I know you better
Know you better
No, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no (yeah)
No, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no (yeah)
No, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no, ooh (baby)
No, no, no, no, ooh, no, no, no, no, ooh (baby)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better (know no better)
'Cause, baby, I know you better
'Cause, baby, I know no better
Baby, I know you better (baby, I know...)
Baby, I know you bet-
