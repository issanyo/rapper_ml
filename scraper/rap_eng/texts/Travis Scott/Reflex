[Intro: Kurt Russell in "Big Trouble in Little China"]
This is Jack Burton in the Porkchop Express and I'm talkin' to whoever's listenin' out there
Like I told my last wife
I says, "Honey, I never drive faster than I can see, besides that, it's all in the reflexes"

[Chorus]
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another Xan' just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Won't you flex that ass again
Off a reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another Xan' just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Off a reflex, off a reflex (yeah), off a reflex (yeah)
I've been blowing through these bands, I'm in a deep check (brr)
All these bitches in my room, I feel like Keith Sweat (oeh)
We been going too in, I think I need a rest (I need it)
When you leave, I think about it, damn, I need it (I need it)
Johnny Cochran on these hoes the way I beat it (I beat it)
You make me weak, but don't mistake it for my weakness
I've been out here, I've been out here with your deepest
Automatic, going in, I'm going T-Rex
VVSs turn the T-shirt to a V-neck (straight up)
Gon' create and spend that money we ain't seen yet
All my niggas out and they gon' make it

[Bridge]
Off the reflex (yah), off the reflex (yah), off the reflex (yah)
Had to pop another Xan' just to reset (yah)
Just to reset (yah), just to reset (yah)
Won't you flex that ass again
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex (alright, alright, yeah)
Pop another Xan' just to reset, just to reset

[Break]
(Turn my vocal up, yeah)

[Chorus]
Off the reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another Xan' just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset
Won't you flex that ass again
Off a reflex, off the reflex, off the reflex
Had to pop another Xan' just to reset
Just to reset, just to reset

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
