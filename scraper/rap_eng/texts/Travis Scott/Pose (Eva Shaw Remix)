[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Stir it up, porridge
Getting dope, so rich
Ah smoke it
And I ain't never liked a broke bitch
I don't never fuck with ya hoe bitch
Quiet down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low , I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch

[Post-Chorus]
Take it off
Wanna see you work it like oh my god
And that thang is out I know you know
And you bounce it like I know you know
Bitch I know you know

[Drop: Eva Shaw]

Pose bitch

Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low , I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch

Wanna see you work it like oh my god
And that thang is out I know you know
And you bounce it like I know you know
