[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
'70s, she just want a hit of the coke now...

[Verse 1: Jason Eric]
Y'all want a hit? Well, fucking here it is
Travis coming with the Louis V carriages, a bacardi of that hypno
Whatever that will get you high and make you hit the floor
Grey goose get you loose, well baby let them know
We just bought the ship, and want to see you on the show
It's the weekend, It's the weekend
You've been working all week and
You just wanna let go, and let the drinks flow
She's so intoxicated, she's letting her mind show
She is so X-Rated, my style, It's provocative
So it's anticipated that I get you butt-naked
