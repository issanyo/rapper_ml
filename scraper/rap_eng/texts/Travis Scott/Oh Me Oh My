Yeah, showdown
Showdown


Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't f..ckin' with us, don't come to our side

Oh me, oh my, I know these niggas some small fries (oh my)
Oh me, oh my, I serve a nigga like it's Five Guys
Lil bitty bitch with the brown eyes
She cook up the dope a million times (whip!)
And it come back to me a trillion times (come on back)
Birds singin' just like Ginuwine
Independent, never signin' (independent!)
Bitch I bought my own diamonds
Bitch I did cases, nigga move in silence
I met my plug on the island
Young nigga hot in designer
Feds watchin', they can't find me
We make the birds take a shower
Free my niggas in confinement
These niggas lookin' like cowards
Mama said don't f..ck with you, boy you sour (mama!)
The way that I play with the white
You'd think that a nigga be cookin' with flour (white)
Got a sniper in the tower
Money bring more power
I got a sniper in the tower
He been up for 24 hours

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't f..ckin' with us, don't come to our side

Come from the club around 3: 30
I've been up in it, call James Worthy
I've been up, goin' up, way up
Thinkin' about it all day, f..ck
How many more could fit in the ride?
Hit me, I'll pull up on any side
All of my niggas on 'em
All of my bitches off 'em
Open, open up, baby
You know that I'm goin', goin', goin', goin' right now
Hundred bottles, we get poppin' right now
Smokin', don't you choke on dopest right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh me, oh my, oh me, don't try
Won't you come home for a ride?
We can do this for the night

Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
See them rollin' with me, yeah they ride or die
Test us and I guarantee we let it fly
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I just shut the club down, I ain't even try
I always tell the truth, boy, I ain't gotta lie
If you ain't f..ckin' with us, don't come to our side

If you not f..ckin' with us
If you not f..ckin' with us
Then say you not f..ckin' with us
We don't wanna f..ck with that fake shit
We don't wanna f..ck with that fake shit
We don't wanna f..ck with that fake shit

Oh me, oh me, oh my
