I can't get no rest (we in the house)
I fall asleep with a Tec (rack)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (rack)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (we in the house) (come on)
I can't get no rest (come on)
I ride around with a Tec (champ)
Stashin' all the pills in my desk (champ)
Wearin' every chain on my neck (go crazy on 'em)
