[Intro:  Chris Holloway]
She said she want to party and hit the dancefloor...

[Travis Scott]
Hello
Yeah
What's up ?
Where you at ?
Say what ?
Aight I'm on my way. I'm on my way !

[Hook: Chris Holloway]
You giving me your word
Everytime we talk
I just can't get enough of your voice
Ain't nobody do me like you do

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Fresh off the plane
My face scary in my saki [?]
That I ride with
Got me in the rush
We hiding
Over-sea is where I be, internationally
[?]

[Verse 2: Chris Holloway]
I see you over there
[?]
But I don't know your name but I'm wiling to know
[?]
You so contagious, your body outrageous
[?]
I want you you right now
I want you you right now

[Hook: Chris Holloway]
You giving me your word
Everytime we talk
I just can't get enough of your voice
Ain't nobody do me like you do
