[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Weeknd]
Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Pills
Have you ever been through life's
Challenges? Promises? Promises?
Get down, heartbreak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott and The Weeknd]
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

[Bridge: The Weeknd & Travis Scott]
No, oooo
We don't pray for love, no more, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Just ask the lonely)
Hm, no, no, no, no, yeah

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wife
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax faster than a hi-hat
Sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh-ohh, don't pray for love
Oh-ohh, say it loud
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
Just ask the lonely, oh-oh
