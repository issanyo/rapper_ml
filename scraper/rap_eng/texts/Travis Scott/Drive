(Cassette rewinding)

[DJ Screw]
10-201, you know what I'm sayin'?
Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

(Cassette rewinding)

[Sample from Lil Flip's "I Can Do Dat"]
What, sucker free, what, what
I can do dat (I can do dat right there)
I can do dat, ay

If I spill drank on my clothes - I can do dat
It don't matter cause I buy me some more - I can do dat
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat
I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'...

(Cassette rewinding)

[Sample from Z-Ro's "I Can't Leave Drank Alone"]
I, can't, leave, drank alone
It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good, Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood)

(Car driving and speeding; tires screeching)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn a brother stay tested and the devil wear Prada
(Just trynna go up the avenue)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that's the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed cause its driving me wild

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Oh yeah

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Outro]
Dad: Junior!
Travi$: Fuck...

Travi$: Man, for what, nigga shutup
Dad: What'd I tell you about playing' that loud ass music in this fuckin' house?!?
Travi$: Fuck! Fuckin' drums crazy...
