[Intro: Travis Scott]
I'm finessin', finessin' (straight up)
I came up 100 bands a week, straight off finessin'
La Flame

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Walked in this bitch, I just got through finessin' designer (straight up)
Oh my God it's no rental, gold plated, no need to remind you
Robbed my plug, that nigga wasn't getting me high (that dope)
Oh no no, oh no no no no no no no
Stack on black as True Religion (straight up)
This that shit that keep you geekin' (that dope)
I done fucked me 'round 5 bad bitches this morning (La Flame)
And I ain't goin' back unless they horny (oh no)
Oh no no, oh no no no no no no no

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Finessing, finessing (straight up)
I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame)
Finessing, finessing (bando)
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing (straight up, straight up)
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing
Been on that weed with my team
Rolling with my team, yeah they all finessing

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Man, here it go, fishcale, A1 perico
Fill PJ's up with kilos, then sell it like it's legal, yeah
Everybody he know, could have gotten hit with the RICO
Caught a couple of charges, they were weak though
Feds had to let him go in a week or so
Still, still need the key to blow
Whole heap of dough, ran the streets for so long
Man the team was so on, damn it seem like so long
Ago, we had 'em in Mexico
He tryna' make it back, three bricks more
The people always run up on us in Texas though
Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though
Some lil' young nigga with some big dreams
Almost on the verge of doing some big things
Tryna' get a bird since he was sixteen
And now he playin' ‘round with fifteen or more, ay
You know a nigga love nice things
And the price in the hood is too frightening
Them niggas ain't gon' do the right thing
It’s time for me to do my thing (hey!)

[Beat Re-Switch]

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Finessing, finessing (straight up)
I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame)
Finessing, finessing (bando)
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing (straight up, straight up)
Finessing, finessing (straight up)
I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame)
Finessing, finessing
I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing (straight up)

[Outro: Travis Scott]
How high?
Tell me why she wanna leave me
She used me to get high
Oh she used me to get higher, higher, higher
So tell me why she wanna leave me?
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh, ooh-oooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
As the days go on, the southern region of our national anthem
The quest for La Flame, this journey, it's the last days
