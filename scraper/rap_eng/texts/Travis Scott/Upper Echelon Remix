Travis Scott (hook) x2
Pull out the seven
Pull out the ride
We so high, upper echelon
We so fuckin' high, upper echelon

[Joey Sap];
Seee you need rap paraphernalia
To get your skills up, to pass the bar hmm
I'm not one magazine ima whole catalog

In 8 days i make 2 worlds
One up in god
They said I'm wako looney satan
I get fucked up so ofton
I don't see life in problemo's
I made it through the tunnel faster than old people
Trying to ? pharmaceuticals ?
My life's lowkey i don't need many doors
Surviving in a world that makes me a businessman
But it makes that girl a whore, no more, be gone, you a whore
I'm Americon no comment on it
I got many things to say, i might vomit
Bitch grab the karmet and clean it up, we outta here on the ? spaceship to the bahamas
Take up our armors, im going bonkers, listen to the Grim Reaper ?
Go to Sleep, wait you better pause it.. ha
