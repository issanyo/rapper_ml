[Verse 1: Jason Eric (OG CHESS)]
Gettin high that a bitch on my special plane, switch it up
In the light, doing my thing
Blow me
Light up, spark a tree
No diss, keep it hood in my LRG
Gettin high that a bitch on my special plane, switch it up
In the light, doing my thing
Blow me
Light up, spark a tree
No diss, keep it hood in my LRG
Still ballin in the mix with some chicks
Yeah they jumpin', all 96
Remember All Star weekend?
Them Lil' Puerto Ricans?
Yeah, I was freakin', all freakin' weekend

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Hit the corner store for a [?] or double up
Just got a page from a MILF who wanna double up
Bring up Chess, the [?] trippin' so I hug it up
But I ain't trippin' I got five more jumping so
Hopped in my dirt bike, 'till it break white
Eating pegs on the mongoose I got in third grade
Bumble bee raincoat make it rain honey
Cause them shots I made, I made those in them Jay's so

[Verse 3: Jason Eric (OG CHESS)]
Classmates in this bitch
Miami grippin' the game, ducking the vice
Tried to plan something on me like I'm stuck in a vice
Step in the place, why you buckin the ace?
I come first, get the hell out the way
And get bent over
Dope kicks, dope bitch flip her [?]over
Hands out, no [?], flip your hand over
That ass fat enough to pop a band over
You think I'm playing? Press play on the camcorder
