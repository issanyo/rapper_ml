[Verse 1: Miguel]
Uh set it up, keep rollin', rollin', drop it
Baby drop it like your stalling, stalling tonight
I wanna ride that wave
Body built for the beach, do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep, body surf on me

[Chorus: Miguel & (Travis Scott)]
Don't stop, I wanna ride that wave
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I'm gon' surf in it baby
Get turnt in it baby (Yeah yeah), put work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave

[Verse 2: Miguel & (Travis Scott)]
Put it out, I'm on fire, fire
That’s what I’m about, take me higher, higher, tonight
I'm gonna ride that wave (Straight up)
You got a little body built for the beach
Do you got that ocean?
Body surf, don't sleep, body surf on me, woman

[Chorus: Miguel & (Travis Scott)]
Don't stop, I'm gonna ride that wave (Yeah)
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I wanna surf in it baby (Yeah, yeah)
Get turnt in it baby, put work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
I'ma make the waves, just bring your surfboard yeah
I've been offshore, I've been offshore
Somewhere shaded with my hair braided (Straight up)
Hate to tell you I couldn't make it yeah
But be your man, I can be that later
Right now I might pull up on ya' on my surfboard like I'm Kelly Slater
Lotta shit that I might forget
I got emails, texts, I ain't read those yet
Replying to all those needs you said
Like moving on, I might feel that way yeah
But lately I've been hoping for change
If you catch that wave won't you surf to me yeah?
Damn right girl, you are a bad bitch
And she fish my way, I gotta catch it
I take a late night swim, been a minute
Pussy so wet, always drown when I'm in it
Doing 105 on the 101 home
She told me don't stop but I'm already gone

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't stop, I wanna ride that wave
All night, I'm gonna ride that wave
Look here, I'm gon' surf in it baby
Get turnt in it baby, put work in it baby
Keep working it while I ride that wave

[Bridge: Miguel]
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, god damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
I could ride that wave right now, say
Yeah, get wild baby, so hot, god damn, I need a towel baby
I could wipe you down right now baby
I could ride that wave right now, say
