[Intro:]
Yeah
Welcome back
If this is this is your first time, thank you
"Don't Be S.A.F.E." is still free on LiveMixTapes, cheap bastard
Just kiddin, anyways
Let's go!

[Hook:]
DJ what you do this for? [x7]

[Verse:]
I do this for my mama
I don't do this for you niggas
I do this for my fans
I don't do this for no pictures
I do this for my friends
Treat them niggas like my family
Y'all niggas was hatin'
But them same niggas was fans of me
Got these bitches faintin' when they see my face in magazines
Nigga I ain't playin'
I'm in that Flight Club faithfully
Or in Soho...
Bing a real nigga is a crime, I know it
I got a hundred charges

[Outro:]
A lot of gold, a lot of hoes
Don't mean nothin' if you got no soul
Niggas might hate me
But it's the reason I was chose
Amen
