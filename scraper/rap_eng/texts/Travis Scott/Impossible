[Verse 1]
You the one, you know me the best
You the one I call when I'm stressed
This the time of the year I feel alone
This the time of the year you treat me wrong
Yeah, this the late night, you know the deal (deal)
On a late night, nowhere to chill
Yeah, I'm on the west, yeah, I'm on the west side
Off the drugs, know I'm not the best guy
But you know I always get it done, yeah
You done had all of the rappers, I'm the one, yeah
Ain't gon' lie, I remember how it feels, yeah
Ain't gon' lie, I'ma tell you this for real, yeah
Split a pack of the woods down
Ride with me, yeah, you wish you could now
Always come and go and never fail
It was never love, I could tell now
She pop 'em up, Blue Chanel just to get it up
Parking lot full of foreign hoes on the regular
With them painted toes in them heels
Let's go find a place that's far from here, for real
Far from here

[Chorus]
Nights like this, nights like this, I wish I could do the impossible
I wish I could do the impossible
Nights like this, nights like this, I wish
I could do the impossible, I could do the impossible

[Verse 2]
But you the one, you know me the best
You the one I call when I'm stressed
This the time of year when I'm alone
This the time of the year we get our own
I can't lie when I'm out on the west
Yeah, the west, yeah, yeah, the west side
And lately, I ain't been feeling the best
'Cause you the best, yeah, you my best high
They know what you're dealing with
Now you know what's wrong, what the feeling is
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rastas rolling in Benz up in here
Bandits poppin' them bars up
Man don't run up the bands that make them gun claps in here
No fear, no fear, you rock, I hear
I'm gon' let you know that the man is for real
Yeah, for real
Far from here

[Chorus]
Nights like this, nights like this, I wish I could do the impossible
I wish I could do the impossible
Nights like this, nights like this, I wish
I could do the impossible, I could do the impossible

[Outro]
Yeah
I wish I could do the impossible
I wish I could do the impossible
I could do the impossible
