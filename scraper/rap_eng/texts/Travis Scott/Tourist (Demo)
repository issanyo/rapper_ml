[Intro: Travis Scott]
How many times the merry-go-round goes around
You come around a whole lot of times

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great (woo)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
I might pass that little bitch back to my buddy (pass it, buddy)
Pass that bitch, pass her to my buddy (pass it, buddy)
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great (yeah)
Bust a little bitch, pass her to my buddy (straight up)

[Verse: Travis Scott]
Gin and tonic, pass that to my buddies (my buddies)
On that lean and soda, I'm not no alcoholic (alcoholic)
How does that feel, my nigga? (woo) I said it feel great (woo, woo)
Come bust a trip and come and be my tourist (straight up)
Alligator swamp (woo), we pill pop in my hood
Ain't no changin' that, cut that check we all good (straight up)
9 A.M. clockin', 4 A.M. water whippin'
Just got to the Mo', my niggas still leanin', tippin'
Had to bust a bitch I knew back from my old days
Shawty held me down when a nigga had that bald fade (straight up)
504, my nigga, shout my woadie
La Flame killin' you, niggas, damn, I'm sorry (damn, I'm sorry)
That's not my kid, call up my nigga, Maury (nigga, Maury)
Drinkin', drivin', but I wore a condom and I'm stickin' to that story
I bust a nut like I bust a brick
Bust a band like I bust a bitch
Bust a nigga like I bust a bitch
But I pass it like I'm Robert Horry (straight up)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
(Bust a trip, come and be my tourist)
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
(Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest)
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great (straight up, woo)
(How does it feel, damn it feel great)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist
(Bust a trip, come and be my tourist)
Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest
(Pretty bitches walkin' 'round my forest)
How does it feel, my nigga? Damn it feel great (woo)
Bust a trip, come and be my tourist (straight up)
