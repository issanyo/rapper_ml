[Intro: MPA Duke]
Travis Scott and Lil' Duke (yeah)
Rodeo, shit

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
On my vibe, on my vibe, I've been drinkin'
Every time, every time, why we do this?
Spent my mind on my grind, I'm not selfish
We break up, then make up, we can't help it
I've been sippin', I've been poppin' everyday
Let's save some time, we ain't gotta tell no names
They say they want a real one
They say they want a real one to make them feel young
Feel young, feel young

[Verse: Duke & Travis Scott]
Been fuckin' with some bad bitches out in every state
I can't deal with them if they too young, please don't come my way
I just want you on the road with me while I chasing my dream
She make me feel young, all we do is play
We break up, we make up and fuck all day
I told her if she ain't down get the fuck up out my way
I'ma give you one more chance, I don't got no time to waste
Now, what you got to say?
She said, "Okay, alright, I'm glad you on" (yeah)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
On my vibe, on my vibe, I've been drinkin'
Every time, every time, why we do this?
Spent my mind on my grind, I'm not selfish
We break up, then makeup, we can't help it
I've been sippin', I've been poppin' everything
Let's kill some time, we ain't gotta tell no names
They say they want a real one
They say they want a real one to make them feel young
Feel young, said  they want a real one to make them feel young
On my vibe, on my vibe I've been drinkin'
Every time, every time, why we do this?
Spent my mind on my grind, I'm not selfish
We break up, then makeup, we can't help it
I've been sippin', I've been poppin' everything
Let's save some time, we ain't gotta tell no names
They say they want a real one
Say they want one to make 'em feel young
Real one, make 'em feel young
Feel young, want a real one to make 'em feel young
Feel young, make 'em feel young
Feel young, feel young
