[Chorus]
Gold 88, 88
Pumpin' twist somethin', break it down
We can get it jumpin'

[Verse 1]
88s in my projects, swear I came here to riot
With a gang of niggas, orangutan niggas
Playing Russian roulette in the lobby
With a gang of gold, fuck her face
Then hit the avenue, send her home, I think a cab will do
Never loved these hoes, I think I love this hoe
Wait, (Shut the fuck up)
Seven digits for the chain nigga
Egyptian sculpture for the rain nigga
When the flex bomb drop nigga cold homie
Coolin' out where it never rain nigga
Screamin hallelujah fuckin with the double X why'd ya do it?
Leave you hangin' watch your momma mop the fluid
Now your casket closed screaming 'how they knew ya'

[Chorus]
Gold 88, 88
Pumpin' twist somethin', break it down
We can get it jumpin'
Gold 88, 88
Gold 88, 88

[Verse 2]
Marc Jacobs straight for the poncho
Chiefin' wit' the head honcho
Ball in a different timezone
Put an extra scale in my condo
[?] and the sun is out
[?] never lost the nails
I remember [?] and
What the rumor is, give a fuck 'bout what the rumor is
I'm factin' niggas so popular
Shittin' all in yo binoculars
Shoot it nigga ain't no stoppin' us
We them diamonds try to rock with us
Can't fuck with mi-mi
Sippin' and its all for mi-mi
Every time she call, she just tryna see me
Don't ya man just wish he be me

[Chorus]
Gold 88, 88
Pumpin' twist somethin', break it down
We can get it jumpin'
Gold 88, 88
Gold 88, 88
