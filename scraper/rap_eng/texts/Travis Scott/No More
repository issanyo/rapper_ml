[Intro: Travis Scott]
You know, the comedown, we really feeling soothing
The comeup got 'em all oozing
Took a one way to take it out of Houston
Took the Metro and we was still booming

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I just pour 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more
I pour up 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Nowadays I be on ecstasy when I'm bored
I don't even know who keep it real anymore
All that living fast, pour the lean, make ya snore
You know I ain't that nigga to be played, do your homework
If I could do it all over, I'd make the same mistakes
All that fucking over made me who I am today
Slime Maybach with the drapes, you can't see me crash
I was in the school, don't see you pass
I tried the Percy but it ain't work, and I'm a still pop 'em
Drinking purple, smokin' purp, I need to see a body
All that pain, I'm poppin' molly like a antibiotic
I can't help that I'm a zombie, I can't heal my heartache

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be faded but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be faded but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Tried love but I can't no more (Nah)
Tryna find loyalty, it ain't no more (Nah)
Told myself I wasn't gonna drink no more (On God)
It's like the styrofoam glued to me though (Straight up)
I feel weak for using drugs to ease the pain (21)
From the street, concrete in my vein (Straight up)
Lil bit of change make a nigga change (On God)
Different tax bracket but my number still the same (Facts)
I done seen dope turn a nigga who had hope
To a nigga with no hope, hung himself by a rope (Straight up)
No joke 'cause he didn't know the ropes
And he served an undercover, judge gave his ass a boat (Facts)
I done seen fame turn a nigga on his bro
Turn a bitch into a nigga, nigga turned into a ho (21)
Identity crisis, people don't know who they is
'Cause these bitches act like niggas
And these niggas act like hoes (Straight up)
Shooting for the moon but the stars just fine (21)
Tryna make a dollar and I'm short nine dimes (21)
You know I'm a hustler, I'ma grind 'bout mine (21)
Long as I got Metro, nigga I'm gon' shine

[Chorus: 21 Savage, Travis Scott, & Kodak Black]
I sip drank until I can't no more
Pour up the lean until I can't no more
One more cup, I think I just might snore
I sip drank until I can't no more
Pour up the lean until I can't no more
One more cup, I think I just might snore
I just pour 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be faded but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more

[Outro]
(Lord, save the world
Lord, save the world
Lord, save the world)
Lord, save the world (Lord, save the world)
Lord, save the world (Lord, save the world)
From this hunger for power (Lord, save the world)
From certain destruction's hour
Motherfuckers cannot listen to that fuckin' save the world shit
No, I don't like it
We are totally against that shit
You stream it, iPhone or your phone, whatever
I'm taking the shit and I'm here to tell you
I'm here to keep rap the fucking same
He's trying to save it, I'm not
You'll all be heroes
