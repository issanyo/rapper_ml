[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I, Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I

[Sample: Travi$ Scott]
Feel like I'm, feel like I'm (on the drive to the moon)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada (Just trynna go up an avenue)
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
Be rockin' furs, look like copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours I just stared at the stars
Look with my eyes closed cause it's driving me wild

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)
Hit the weed and just drive (just drive)

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

[Verse 2: Matt Healy]
I hit the weed and just drive
Never fucked around so Iâ€™ll be alright
And you can sit around here fucking with smaller minds than mine, live your life
She said the air is so clean
I think it was the codeine
But she thinks it's just trees
I like it when you stroke me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
She likes to take LSD
Searching mathematical purity
Travel with security
Smokin' in the wind
Losing all my friends, smokin' in the wind
She said I'm feeling so lean, I think you called it codeine
Now her heads on their knees
I like it when you blow me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch,  don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
