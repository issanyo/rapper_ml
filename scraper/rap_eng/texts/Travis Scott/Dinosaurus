[Intro: Yung Mazi & Travis Scott]
Mazi Osbourne, ya dig what the fuck I'm sayin'? You know I'm, the type of nigga that's gonna fuck a ho, send her to the store, pull off on her. You know, bitch said I had a baby on the way, I told her we gon' see on Labor Day. I ain't gonna drop a bitch off unless she stay on the spray away. Ayy, when these hoes gonna pull up for all of us? Yeah, you get what I'm saying, you wanna marry 'em, you gotta marry my niggas, fuck you mean? Tell that bitch I said shut the fuck up, sit down, and pour up
Bitch

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Fightin' the mood
Breakin' the rules, howl at the moon
Yellin' my blues, wanna hit snooze
Chase it with booze
I'm out in the noon, she out in the nude
Fightin' the fumes, it's hotter than June
I'm under the moon followin' you
I'm out of my head, I'm out on the road
It's nowhere to go, I gave you my soul
Am I right, am I wrong?
Tryna get home
The love, I'm up in the hill
My high's as low as a hill
High's as low as a hill

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous

[Verse 2]
I'm in them ovaries, I'm in them ovaries
I don't know these niggas, ridin' with them motorists
Fallin' on some diamond bourse and now we all rich
Hidin' all this, hide in that [?], I just [?]
Now it's a party, yeah it's a garden, let's get it started
I forgot it, she pass the Marley, tweak off a molly
Pop a Xan', tie the red up
Don't hold a petty hoe for ransom
Goddamn for answer, pop on a lancer

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous

[Break: Travis Scott]
Dinosaurus, dinosaurus

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Pop the codeine and pour the porridge
Got some shorties to pull up on us
To walk my orbit and fuck my homies
It's quite enormous, my dinosaurus
You're my tourist, come be my tourist
I bought vatore, bought my wrist some more wrist
12 at the door, flush it down the toilet
With dem boys, whippin' it enormous
My dick enormous
