Fuck out of my business/
I did things that most men would ask forgiveness/
Broke the code of commandments from my descendants/
Who gives a fuck? New Trojan in the building/
We ride with no limits/
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me trying to finish?/
I'm in a bad mood, rob that dude/
Fuck that couch, burn that house/
We the cause of the era, new niggas with new terror/
4,000 on the leather, you niggas should know better/
Them niggas new slaves, i do say.../
Fuck! Fuck! twice, only on a Tuesday/
When i'm in a bad mood/
Ooh nigga i'm wylin on 'em/
Ooh back balling on 'em/
I never feel the pain/
Only God can make it rain/
So i must be Mary, Joseph, Allah/
Kid of a disciple, thoughts are suicidal/
Jumping off the building, thinking like a psycho/
They trying to find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty/
It's alright, he's after the meds, Chris Bobby/
...Oh shit
