[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (hold up)
Ayy, count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop, comin' in, comin' in
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, hold up
I don't know what planet I'm on (Oh Lord)

I feel like Voldo, I'll chop off your arms (Off your arms, yuh)
Steady causin' havoc, yeah (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm ballin' hard just like a Maverick (Yeah)
Money stretch long, lil' bitch, like elastic (Yeah)
Now that bitch steady callin' me Mr. Fantastic, yeah, ayy

If you play, boy I'll turn your ass to ashes, yeah
Automatic, doo, doo, doo, doo, bitch, I'm blastin' yeah (Doo, doo, doo, doo)
Ooh, put you in a casket, yeah (Yeah)
Money stretch long, it's elastic
I don't know what planet I'm on (I'm on Mars)
I'm a king, lil' bitch, watch the throne
I feel like Voldo, I'll chop off your arms (Yuh, watch the throne)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd & Travis Scott]
Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap (Yeah)
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (hold up, It's lit)
Ayy, count my guap, count my guap (Straight up)
Cannot stop, comin' in, comin' in (Yeah, yeah)
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead (Alright)
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Trippie Redd]
Astroworld's my planet, my home (Yeah)
Car's too hot, the fumes too strong (Yeah, yeah, it's lit)
Mixed this cup for way too long (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Add it up, don't subtract it (Yeah, yeah)
Pour this eighth with me and let's get blasted (Straight up)
Lambo drive like a dragon (Skrrt, skrrt, ooh)
Can't fall asleep at night 'cause they attackin', yeah
I hop in the coupe, go insane
I disappear, go David Blaine

I double cup to drown the pain (Drank)
Light the octane (Gas)
I'ma put six in the Lambo and jet to the plane (Skrrt, skrrt)
Move for this chain with your elbow, I hope you got aim (Hope you got aim)
Don't need no more stains, or get hot like my name (La Flame)

Please say the name three times, we gon' pop up on you

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Hold up
Take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (Hold up)
Ayy, count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop, comin' in, comin' in
Pull up in a drop top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands
