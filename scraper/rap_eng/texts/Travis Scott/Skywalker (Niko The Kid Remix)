Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Bull-Bull-Bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador

[Verse 1: Miguel]
Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up (splish)
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up

Don't sleep you gotta stay up
Don't sleep you gotta stay up

Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wildin' on my haters (yah)
In my 23s, havin' a Jordan moment
Wildin' with the paper (it's lit)
Ice all on my chain, I'ma...
I just popped two, I'll be stayin' up (yeah, yeah)
Hangin' with the gang, that shit dangerous, yeah
I can't fuck you with my chains, that shit tangle up, yeah
Come and catch a wave, take one out my cup, yeah
Damn near OD'd (OD'd)
Damn the police, woah (hey)
Wildin' in SV, yeah (hey)
Movin' up your street, yeah (straight up)
When we on the creek
And bring sand to the beach (alright)
Ain't no day, ain't no night
Made no plans, ain't no sleep

[Repeat Verse 1]
Cap and a stem, catch a wave on us
Take a shot, make a friend, just enjoy the moment
I'm Luke Skywalkin' on these haters
Celebrate every day like a birthday
Good things come to those that wait up
But don't wait to jump in too long
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Don't, don't sleep, you gotta stay up

Don't sleep, you gotta stay up
Don't sleep, you gotta stay up

[Outro]
Quick to dead the bull like a matador
Quick to dead the bull like a matador

Quick to dead the bull like a matador
