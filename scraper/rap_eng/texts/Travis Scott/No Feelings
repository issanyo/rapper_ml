[Verse 1: Amill Darsell ]
Smoke so much purp that I just might go colorblind
Dick so long, you can land a plane on it, I'm just being honest
Picking your bitch like a guitar for later (yeah what's up?)
She ringing me cause she know I'ma only pick up for the pay up
Get that pussy wet, my lifestyle aquatic
My bad bitch, she exotic, she is a
Native, Egyptian, American, she's every woman, she's swearing it
I told her, I need my reefer
Fuck me, suck me and rub my tummy
Can't believe that she keep our little secret for so long

[Hook: Amill Darsell]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
Drank so much codeine, drinking 'til I'm colorblind
She gon' do the coke until she can't see the line
I re-ed up on my reefer
Xanax got me sleeper
Leaner by the liter
I drown in my bitch, she aquarius
All this codeine got me nodding off
Yo bitch at the crib, nodding off
All these pills got me nodding off
I'ma get turnt 'til my knob is off
Give her my love, nigga not at all, nod it off you know

[Hook: Amill Darsell]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings
No feelings, no feelings, no feelings, no feelings

[Hook: Amill Darsell]
She said, "All I'm ever good for is sex and money"
Di-dick and money
I said "All I wanna give to you girl, is this dick and money
This dick and money"
This dick and money, this dick and money
