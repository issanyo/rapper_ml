[Intro]
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

[Verse 1]
Done with these fellas
I don't love these fellas
We dust off these fellas
Do it for fun
Don't take it personal
Personally, I'm surprised you called me after the things I said
Skrt skrt on fellas
Skrt up on fellas
Skrt down, you acting like me
Acting like we wasn't more than a summer fling
I said farewell and you took it well
I promise I won't cry over spilled milk
Gimme a paper towel, gimme another Valium
Gimme another hour or two, hour with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you bother me when you know you don't want me?
Why you bother me when you know you got a woman?
Why you hitting me when you know you know better?
Know you know better
Know your crew better than you do when
Call me looking for you
I been looking for you
Got me looking forward to weekends
With you baby, with you baby
With you baby
With you, woah
We do whatever we want, go wherever we want
Love however we want, it don't matter
You'll do whatever I want, get whatever I want
Do whatever I need, it's about

[Chorus]
Love, 'long as we got
Love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Should've never gave you my number, I did it with you
Should've never let you hit it, I split it with you
I regret it, you gots the fetish
You gots the problem, now it's a problem, oh, no
Skrrr, skrrr on bitches (yah)
I don't know these bitches (yah)
Dig dirt on bitches, do it for fun
Don't take it personal, baby
Love on my ladies, love to my ladies
Dated a few
Dated a few
Dated a few
