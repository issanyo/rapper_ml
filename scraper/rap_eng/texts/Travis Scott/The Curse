[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, ooh-oh
Yeah
Yeah, ooh-oh
Yeah, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse

[Chorus]
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
Niggas always plottin' on your worth, yeah
But momma always taught you put in work
Put in work, yeah, put in work, yeah
When your niggas switch up on you, that's the worst, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah, ooh-ah

[Verse 1]
Got a call on the plane, I just left Meech
Second row, the guy next to me havin' a slick conversation
Mama said the state denied for the fifth time
She need to borrow right now, yeah
I wrapped the money, flew it like a kite to H-Town, yeah
Now we on now like the light bill, but never cuttin' off, yeah
I'm on top now, still comin' down, but never fallin' off, yeah
I might need the distance, all I need is time, time
Can't even look at my phone line
Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply
But they know my name, they compare it, still
We was busting seals before we had a mil'
We done had the grills before we had a deal
I'm a Houston nigga, that's what made me here
That's the curse, yeah

[Bridge]
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
But your momma always taught you put in work
Put in work, yeah, put in work, yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
They might hit you with that Tyga, never do you right
Hit you with that Bill Cosby, thirty bitches overnight
I might have to hit my back up, hit that 713 side
I might have to pull a Tyga, I might have to crash my ride
Can't be like you niggas, no, can't be like you guys
I can't tell no stories, no, I can't tell no lies
All we do is money, do that money exercise
We just pay our taxes, pay our tax, don't pay no mind
That's the worst

[Refrain]
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah
They love you, then they hate you, that's the curse, yeah, yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yah, yah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yah, yah, yah)
Ooh-wah-oh (yah, yah), ooh-oh (yah, yah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeh-ayy, yeah-ayy-ayy, yeah-ah, yeah, oh, oh-ooh-ohh
