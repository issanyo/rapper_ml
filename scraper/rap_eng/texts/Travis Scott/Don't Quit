[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
You know I like 'em special made for me (yeah)
I call 'em and they demonstrate for me (ooh yeah)
Spent 200k up on that body, yeah
'Cause my lil' baby ain't for everybody, yeah
That's why I hit her with that upgrade (upgrade)
I told her, "Stunt, that's the upstage" (Upstage, upstage)
Everything up and up, babe (up, up and up, babe)
Out here ballin' like we upstate

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Oh, I drip her down in gold (drip, drip, drip, drip it up)
She used to tell me no
But who could tell me no? Yeah
Just how it goes, she sees the O's (yah, yah)
And now she wanna roll
I hate to see her leave sometimes, but that ass on "woah"

[Chorus: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, don't quit
You're doin' good right now, don't quit
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, so don't quit (Let's go!)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Drip lil' baby down in VVS' (VVS)
Cuban link, girl that's a new connection (Cuban link)
It's me and you 'cause we in the selection (select)
Throw it back like it's your new profession (new profession)
Yuh, like you get paid for it
Good brain like you get grades for it (ooh)
Woodgrain, you got a taste for it (ooh)
Leather soft, your body made for it (yah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Oh, I drip her down in gold (drip, drip, drip, drip it up)
She used to tell me no
But who could tell me no? Yeah
Just how it goes, she sees the O's (yah, yah)
And now she wanna roll
I hate to see her leave sometimes, but that ass on "woah"

[Chorus: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, don't quit
You're doin' good right now, don't quit
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, so don't quit (Let's ride!)

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Baby, can we pick it up?
Come over here and sit down
Lil' mama got a vibe, let's ride
On it for a couple weeks now
Yeah, you know it's you and me now
Top off with the seats down
Baby, I'm a savage
Gassed up, couldn't pass it
Ran it back like a rerun
She sittin' pretty like a classic
Green light, we on go
And now she wanna roll
I hate to see her leave sometimes
But that ass on "woah"

[Chorus: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, don't quit
You're doin' good right now, don't quit
Put your old jeans on, now they won't fit
My lil' baby on thick, thick (yah!)
Girl that ass too fat, so don't quit
You know I like it like that, so don't quit (Let's go!)

[Outro: Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
Yah, yah
