[Verse 1: King Chip]
Cut the lights down low
Here comes this walking cloud of smoke
Why is he not never broke?
What is this huh some kind of joke?
This bag of weed will smoke out six states
I'm King Chip, Nigga, ask yo bitch how my dick tastes
I'm in these streets touring with a pound of trees
Smokers always surrounding me
Now these bitches houndin' me, wanna go outta town with me
Told this girl I only fuck two dimes at one time
So she came back with a 9.5 I said "fine"
Fuck it, close enough, open up, let me plug up your socket
Keep some weed in my pocket in case you get out of pocket
Uh we chilling by the pool and bitches wanna get higher
Told her my name was Chip and she told me I was a liar
I'm hot, bitch I'm on fire, she don't even think I'm me
And I really do this shit how the fuck you think I eat?
It's you and your girlfriend?
Cool, it's just me and Travis Scott
We just need some head we don't ask a lot

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Twenty drunk bitches around me
Toastin' up, this can't be life
All these bitches around me
Fresh as fuck, this every night
*Mumbling*
