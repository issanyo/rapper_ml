[Hook: Belly & Travis Scott]
All these bitches come and go
All this money come and go
I'm just tryna double up
Stack it up just to blow it
Watch the money go
Watch the money go
We been trappin' on the phone
We been whippn' on the stove
She make millions on the pole
Where that money go
Where that money go
Can’t fuck with my team
We need like 100 money machine
Pay the price for these dreams
Where the money go
Where the money go (where the money go)
Where the money go
Where the money go (where the money go)

You can find out where the money
When you find it then you let me know


[Verse 1: Belly]
Lost everything my mind included
Got betrayed today they pray to judas
In a daze, they say my days are numbered
Under fire but I remain the coolest
Where's the love, I hate to have to do this
King shit I think I’m back to rule it
Kill a king ya really feel the power
Hang the backstabber, kill the coward
Dopeamine I’m raw as coca leaf
Out of focus, they can’t hope to see
Bitches talk but I just don’t believe
Adam told us there's no hope for eve
Give a bitch the fuckin' moon and stars
Probably say that all she need is space
Now it's fuck her, I just feed the snakes
This the last supper jesus ate

[Verse 2: Belly]
Smoke my thoughts and drink my fears
Pray to god but I don’t think he hears
Water muddy, but the crystal's clear
Case I need to make it crystal clear
Heart cold, but I don’t got no chill
Me and Satan we don’t got no deal
Everybody comin' for this dope
I think I might know how Chapo feels
They condemn the child that lives within
Then condemn the way we live as sin
Say I’m haunted, sipping triple gin
When I just wanna see my niggas win, DAMN
I just wanna see my niggas win
I just wanna see my niggas win
