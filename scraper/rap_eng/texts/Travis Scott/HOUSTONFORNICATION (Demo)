[Intro]
I might need me some ventilation, a little vacation
Californication, might redefine new renovations
Space coupe, back out of the space station
Float around town, do that on the daily

[Verse]
How I'm supposed to feel safe, twelve live adjacent (twelve)
Yeah, crib built like a prison where that bitch is gated (yeah)
Yeah, spendin' all my time up there getting faded (it's lit)
Yeah, handin' out that E! to the Entertainment (alright)
Yeah, you know I'm the saddest poppin' and it's dangerous (pop it, pop it)
Ridin' through the clouds, we goin' through the vapors (phew, phew)
I'm just tryin' to get that paper, stayin' out the papers (skrt, skrt)
It ain't easily done, it ain't easy (yeah)
Pop a seal like it's Chris, make it look Breezy (it's lit)
Wedding bands on my fist, it is freezing (straight up, freeze)
Throw them bands, get a kiss, then she leave me (smash, smash)
I just want the peace, it's still Lambo over Mercedez (yeah, skrrt, skrrt)
Just built the Astroworld playground to play with my baby, yeah (my baby)
Had a few pop singers, anyone could be yo' mama (uh, yeah)
Had some real conversations with my nigga, Bill, about Congress, yeah (straight up)
We at the fest, come and link, per request, yeah (alright)
Send a pin, drop it in, GPS (yah, yeah)
Seein' flashes, oh nah-nah, that's my neck (yah, it's lit)
I been livin' paranoid, watch yo' step (yeah, yeah)
Ain't never freein' up, an' never let y'all, man
We always forgive, but don't forget easily (oh, no)
Cut my phone off so they can never reach me
Life is just a maze, going through my phases (yah)

[Chorus]
I might need me some ventilation, a little vacation
Californication, might redefine new renovations
Space coupe back out of the space station
If it rise on the east, land on the west
We gon' make that shit pop, bust it for a check
Call the plays, link the squad, we gon' make a catch
We gon' go NFL, we gon' intercept
