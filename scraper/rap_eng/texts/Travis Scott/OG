(intro)
My picture...

(Verse1)
Living out West
In a cabin shawty
We try out matrimony
My girl around me
Don't be asking for me
I probably won't answer brodie
I was trying to take you to the top
And you was like I don't want it
I'd show you a little something fancier
You was like keep your money
I don't need it from you
I'm like yes the right answer
To be taken for granted by
Chicks I ain't damage
Hearts oh so cold
When in need of a man
Oh my no no don't you need to pretend
You knew just what you wanted
When you first saw it
Oh for the first time
I don't want mean to offend
But you got a nice ass
And nice smile
And you look like the iconic
Woman of all of my dreams
I couldn't sum up upon
All the words that I thought
When I first saw you
You're my Juliet
I feel like this shit is for real
For all I know..
I could be gone in a hour so
Give me your love while I'm here

(bridge)
And take the
Fruitvale Station train
Straight up to heaven
Where they say there is a better place
And I just want to get away
And escape all the discrimination
This Fruitvale (repeat8x)
What happens at night would you tell me ( like let go of me please)
Until you live a life in fright (I've been shackled by this song)
You'll never know how it feel (been imprisoned by the beat)
Yea this one is for Oscar Grant (so I had to sing along)
Condolences to your family (put a feeling into melody)
I'm holding this 40oz ( I thought why this occurred)
I'm about to pour some out (feeling every single second)
And dedicate this song (off the sound of that one word)
To all my niggas that died (LOVE)
In the war...

[Hook x2]
They always chillin' (and it's just like that)
They always drinkin', smokin'
Homie pour out the liquor
They always gettin' high ( one more time bring it back)
They always chillin'
They always smokin', drinkin'
And they always gettin' high

(Verse2)
Living life fast and I want you (to know)
I'd never disappoint
And I don't know why wish death on me
All i want is happiness and all
They want is hell for me
Rehab, shit I've been on the jugular
With life on the regular
Trying to beat the scheduled
Date I'd be the Nebula, star
That ain't a metaphor
The cause ain't for television
Flaws ain't been seldom switched
To ya'll thinking we'd be down
Why you be hating man?
You should look at yourself behind
That shit when you would rather
Act fake to me
Oh they sound like they want to
Fold me how
I bet one thing a nigga
Won't take from me
That's a damn shame
Others can't wait to see
You fall down on your face
And bleed , thats why I'm taking the
Time out just to tell you that day (when I first saw you)
It had to be fate
I pray that it is if it ain't
I'm through with the talking
Its in with the offense
And she loving the D
She taking it deep
I feel like this shit is for real
And I pray that you know that I care
So love a nigga while I'm still here
Before I'm about to dip

(bridge)
And take the
Fruitvale Station train
Straight up to heaven
Where they say there is a better place
And I just want to get away
And escape all the discrimination
This Fruitvale (repeat8x)
What happens at night would you tell me ( like let go of me please)
Until you live a life in fright (I've been shackled by this song)

And they always gettin' high


Forreal...
