[Intro]
(Sounds of hentai being played)
'Aight play the shit

[Verse 1]
Gon' ban speedy, ban KC
Got all your memes, up that vote, don't get eupho
From the Fresh Coast to the East Coast, come take this trail
Let me tell the tale of how Nate turned Bose
Over one lost trip to the sub
Let me tell the tale cause you told the tale
When you said I could mod this high
Who knew? Dad dammit who knew?
The rez ain't higher on the PC side, it's just true
You can really identify when you lookin' in the frames
You ready to drop, that's true
When they look in my eyes, they see that thirty
How Bosey banned ol' Blues
Had crim against a wall
Every winter 5 delayed
Bright ain't comin' back 'til fall
That's why my mod game so moist
had that Lisa flair and and all
Had little to no bitch in high school
Wasn't no tellin' what Ribey might do
On the north side of that CUT
Hollup, let's take it back to that code
No console but still had game
Just a hundred cuntsicles restrained
Life's a sim with lots junk on the yard
I'ma ride for all of my mods
They forever here by my side
It was just 7 mods in a two channel
discord, yeah that was last June, yeah yeah

[Refrain]
Yeah yeah forreal
Fuck what they postin' 'bout if they ain't postin' 'bout me, kys
Let it be known, yeah it's that real
Yeah yeah forreal
Forreal
Fuck what they postin' 'bout if they ain't postin' 'bout
We them mods everybody talkin' 'bout, it's that real
Yeah, forreal

[Hook x2]
Megaten, we moddin'
Megaten, we memein', shitpostin'
Pibb brought out the hammers
Megaten, we givin' bans
Me-Megaten, we moddin'
Me-Megaten, we postin' meemees
Me-Megaten, we givin' bans

[Verse 2]
Nocturne, one day you'll find your press turn
Now my partys wiped out like dread burn
PJ never missin' out a meme on Discord
Always sit around, just postin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I upvote it
YHVH knows we don't get tired, did more bans than a hammer
Johnny worked for Jewish Atlus and we still ain't get that Final
He stayed in/out the subreddit, you know that made me neutral
Still step out the sub to look at shit, shit like Persona
If a sub don't want me, don't need them still got my Kiseki
And bitch you can keep them normies, go report me
No house light on, fap light on, fuck Strange Journey
You heard me, you heard me, now postin', cuckolding
And my Sea, my Sea came home so it just got real

[Refrain] + [Hook x2]
