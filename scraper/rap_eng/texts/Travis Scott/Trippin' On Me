[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
My girl be thinkin' 'bout girls, she's always trippin' on me
She be trippin' on me, trippin' on me (Straight up!)
My girl be thinkin' 'bout girls, she's always trippin' on me
She be trippin' on me, she be trippin' on me
I told that bitch, "Hallelujah, more power to you"
I be power trippin', it ain't nothin' new though
I told that bitch, "Sayonara, I'mma see you later
Adios, I'm gettin' to the paper"

[Verse 1: Tommy Brown]
She always reachin' for my phone, but we ain't married
She say she love me for me, but she loves the karats
She done met all of my niggas, now I'm embarrassed
Took her all around the world, even took trips to Paris

[Pre-Hook: Tommy Brown & (Travis Scott)]
Now with all this bread I spent, buyin' all your shit
How could I pretend we could just be friends?
And with all the arguments and the "where the hell you been?"
You had good intent, but I must admit (Straight up, straight up!)

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
She always reachin' for my phone, baby we ain't married
And she don't like when I sip that lean, she say it makes me scary
Baby don't try to worry, oh no ordinary
I give you that good dick, longer than a dictionary

[Pre-Hook: Travis Scott]
Now after all this bread I spent, buyin' all your shit
How could I pretend we could just be friends?
And after all the arguments and the "where the hell you been?"
You had good intent, but I must admit

My girl be thinkin' 'bout girls, she's always trippin' on me
She be trippin' on me, she be trippin' on me
I said my girl be thinkin' 'bout girls, she's always trippin' on me
She be trippin' on me, she be trippin' on me
I told that bitch, "Hallelujah, more power to you"
I be power trippin', it ain't nothin' new though
I told that bitch, "Sayonara, I'mma see you later
Adios, I'm gettin' to the paper"

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]
What did I do to lose all your trust?
Girl why you so damn insecure?
Why would I do anything to jeopardize our love?
Girl why you so damn paranoid?
Maybe it's cause you know what you was doin' last night, oh
Maybe you wasn't with your girls when I was really with my boys
Guess I can thank your conscience
