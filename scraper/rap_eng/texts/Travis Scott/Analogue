[Hook]
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
And we gon' fly to Vegas
We gon' raise them glasses when I finally make it
And go home and hit up all the places
Where a nigga grew up and see these bitches I dated
So eager, to treat us like Caesars
I'mma catch amnesia, they gon' have they D's up
So I might remember, when the nights was dimmer
Had nobody to look to, older brother was iller
Seen the look in his eyes, then see straight to her soul
What he feeling inside, damn I never would know

[Hook]
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I’ll blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And I blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you

[Verse 2]
Sweet winter, got head before my dinner
Scream by the half and now we in the mirror
Around this time tonight, niggas is niggas
So we gon' hit the town tonight, roll up the killa
There go my soul, you get the picture
Holy grail filled with wine to pass time
What I fantasize in due time that come alive
And we just pray to god we all be still alive
And we so fly tonight
Hope a nigga touch the sky tonight

[Bridge]
And the stars is out so bright
Let 'em shine over you
And we dance across tonight
I blame it all on you

[Verse 3]
Shut the lights down when I’m in the place
The time is right now, feelin' out of space
It’s like '99, whatever happened to Ma$e
Gotta make it ahead of time like hookers in a race
We gon' shine before they hate us
Eat before the waiters, now more than ever

[Hook]
The stars are out tonight
Let 'em fall over you
If I run away tonight
I'll blame it all on you
And we party every night
And I blame it all on you
