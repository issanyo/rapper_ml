[Intro]
If you could be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you could be real for two seconds

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
First order of business, I gotta fly out my people
Way too many fakes in my face, I can see the evils
Drug addictions, bad bitches
They gotta be chose, see the peacoat
Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yates, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these niggas doubt
They say a nigga'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club (yea)

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Mayzin]
And I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol and all these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol and all these dancers
Gave myself too many
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Mayzin]
From the West Side with love
Rose up from the payment
Things been looking good since Atlantic picked up the placement
Working myself to death this is what you would call a grave shit
I'm 'bout to hit the ball, hold up, let me load all the bases
The basics is, just get your shit straight
The money and the power, my nigga, I used to fixate
Comin' up from nothing, you know you gon' have to hustle
Thru all of the pain and the struggle, so momma don't move a muscle again
And I know you gonna feel me through a pad and a pen
Because it's no other escape with all the feelings within
O-M-G, nigga on my grind, had to leave the crib with the scale
Uncle doin' time, knowing I won't fail
And you know that
Nigga, that's my promise
Killing shit for years and never did I gettin' acknowledged
My vision so panoramic, I'm chillinâ€™ in new hammocks, I'm still out here doin' damage and niggas don't understand it
I'm looking like yeah yeah, you never believed in me
Look in the stands now and all that I see is envy
Look back, I see the crowd, I see the crowd
It's funny that my niggas then, are not my niggas now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I had to take it to the edge so that I make it clear
And now I'm pullin' up and parkin back at your crib

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
And I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol and all these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol and all these dancers
Gave myself too many
