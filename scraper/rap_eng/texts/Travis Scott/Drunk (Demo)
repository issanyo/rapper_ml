Call your friends, let's get drunk

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Young Thug]
Twelve more hours left for us in a day
Call your friends and let's get drunk
I've been drinkin' all day, I've been floatin' all day (Yeah, ooh)
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey!
Bring your ass over here now
You know where, how I stay
I've been gone for some time now
I just want a lil' taste (Yeah)
Mix it, mix it, pour (lean, lean)
Drinkin', sippin', slow (slow it down baby)
Lean so cold now, froze (pfff)
Froze, froze (Hey, chee chee chee chee)
Come on over, get drunk
Yeah, now my nigga wanna re-up (Aye)
Slide down, nigga, how it is
I've been dependent (what)
Biz up in the Bentley
Got a hundred bitches on the private
Another private lit, and all them fightin' in it (What!)
I'm the governor and the politician, you know (aye)
I've been gettin' hammered from the go
I've been in the fan for the smoke (SKRT SKRT!)
Yeah, ooh (what?)
Call your friends to get drunk
I need me a blunt (here)
One, two, three, and I'm gone (what you mean? aye)
Find me up in the sun (skrt skrt)
Bitches up to something (fuck 'em)

[Hook: Young Thug (with Travis Scott)]
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk (Pull up baby! Aye)
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk (Sheesh!)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Caress lil' mama for weed, and she did it for free
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Yeah that thing wet, baby, I need skis
Call your friends and let's get drunk (SKRT!)
Yeah I need to skeet, yeah, oh
Run it back from the track
Then I'ma speed race in that (SKRT!)
Lil' mama still got my back
Pull down your pants, I want crack
I'm growing weed, this ain't trees (Bitch)
My bitch brown like Hennessy (Bitch)
Big blood like Freddy in dreams (Bitch)
Dressed in a tie like the Dean (Bitch)
Drunk and in love with my baby
Baby do not go fast, go slow, wait (skrt skrt)
Tell me, tell me information, I got rank (tell me)
Let's take a shot together and then lay up like planks
Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady
Patr√≥n down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way
Baby girl be like "aye aye aye, aye aye, aye aye"

[Hook: Young Thug]
Call your friends, let's get drunk (hold up)
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

[Outro: Young Thug]
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk, hey
