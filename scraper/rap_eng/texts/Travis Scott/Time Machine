[Verse 1]
You fucking nut, you acting ass, they laugh at us
Stupid bitch, you fucked it up, fuck is over why you toss the dust
With a mask on, when I looked at you I hope they pray for us
Hand-tied to the sky, wonder how a nigga living so high
Is it cause the lights on me? It always rains on me
When I first came home, I was in the feds, they took my kids, homie
Living in a lie homie, man, the devils alive, will I ever survive? I never die, homie
Never knew in my life that I would step into fire

[Chorus]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa

[Verse 2]
Did it all for a little, did it all for my niggas
Shine hard for the bitches, put a mask on for the pictures
Different know from my homies, talk like you donâ€™t know me
Damn its gonna cost tomorrow, all them drunk flicks you wanna show me
Funny how we back here, all my fam here
Twisting up while we rolling up with a wine glass on a glass pier
Went from sleeping at Tony home, moving back to where I was grown
Trippy how
A nigga lifestyle makes me live my life wrong

[Chorus]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Step in to my time machine
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
Whooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoooa-whoa
