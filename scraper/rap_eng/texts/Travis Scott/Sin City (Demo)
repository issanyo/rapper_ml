[Chorus: Wynter Gordon]
I'm in the backseat searching for my memory
Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
10 am, itâ€™s Ransomnia
She see the glass, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home 'cause they just ran me up out of there
Fuck the streetlights, she ran the street tight
She run her mouth, but can't eat right?
Don't read between the lines and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby, you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
The Rollie on me only 'cause to tell what the time is
We lost in the city where sin is no biggy

[Chorus: Wynter Gordon]
I'm in the backseat searching for my memory
Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
After hours, seconds turn into minutes
They like, "We finished", but this shit just the beginning
We in a arms race off-
She ripped the soul out, tell me how that [?] taste
[?]
[?]
In this life, see, we could have a hell of a life
I mean I, these days been a hell of a sight
I'm so twisted, so I fuck around and forgot my shit is
Oh I [?], same place my [?] is
Fuck rap, nigga, we only want [?]
We set trends for young niggas' niggas to follow

[Chorus: Wynter Gordon]
I'm in the backseat searching for my memory
Wonderin' what we did last night
I'm pretty sure it was wild
Because I'm in the backseat with the cops surrounding me
Wonderin' what we did last night
But I'm pretty sure it was wild, wild
