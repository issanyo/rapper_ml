[Intro]
Last night turned into this mornin'
Woke up and still had it zoomin'
Goin' all night, goin' all night
Goin' all night, goin' all night
Goin' all night, goin' all night
Goin' all night

[Verse 1: Hit-Boy]
Okay Remy on my throat
Tonight I'm bout to catch a case
I got pre-rows in my spot
All your OGs know my way
Ahh your dash and my shit loud
Tell me what we bout to do?
Only here for one more night
So I'mma drink enough for two

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Okay, we can go all night, what?
Okay, we can go all night, what?
All night, all night, all night
Now we can go all night
All night, all night, all night
Okay, we can go all night, all night

[Verse 2: Hit-Boy & (Travis Scott)]
Mix the D'usse with the Ace
We switchin' up the pace
We gone get that change
That's mando day to day
Order up more hoes and ice
I smoked my last of the night
Tell the hoes to bring that dank
Now we right back in the game
Bout to do the job
Movin' up the interstate
She doin' Vegas after hours
She just wanna stay up late
(So won't you throw that ass around?)
(This might be your lucky night)
(All night, all night, all night, all night)
(All night, all night, all night, all night)

[Hook]

[Outro: Hit-Boy & (Travis Scott)]
I've been goin' for a week, I've been at it all day
I can never get no sleep, (straight up)
I can never get no sleep, I've been at it all day
I've been goin' for a week, (straight up)
I've been goin' for a week, I've been at it all day
I can never get no sleep, (straight up)
I can never get no sleep, I've been at it all day
I've been goin' for a week, all night
