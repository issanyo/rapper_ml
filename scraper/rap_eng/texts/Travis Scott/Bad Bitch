Come in, girl
Yeah, I wanna see you shaking
Chup it low, bring it up, I want you to take it
She's the baddest that I've ever had
Let me see you in the
Picture slow images
Plus  I like a wet bady
Slip and slide in that pussy
I'm impatience for that, I'm so outta line
We can play
And then slow it down, then slow it down

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]

You can get wet for one night, one night on me
You can get wet for one night, one night on me

Sky's so high, lights so bright

You can get wet for one night, one night on me
