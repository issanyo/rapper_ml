[Intro: Ocean, Brian and Travis Scott]
Ocean
(Yeah, yeah)
Here we go

[Verse 1: Brian]
Lately I've been on the block
Tryna see why it shouldn't have been me
What I do, can't you see, all I'm tryna do is give you all a meme
Is it the clothes? Is it the [? yeet]
I know I ain't the person you wanted me to be
But that's not a reason you should lie about me
Remember the times we had together and [? scream]
[? incoherent mumbling] Rick and Morty
But now you're out the door, no apology
After everything I do, treat me like Maury
You think I'm missing it? Not even partly
Thankful for all my bros, they be keeping me up
After dump, trump, slump, flung into force bump
High jump, it was more like a suction pump
My feelings don't matter, speed bump

[Chorus: David]
Gave you my all, but do you even care at all
I gave you a call (brr), but you don't seem to recall
Always been there for you, never got a single thank you
Was I just a fool and start to look a lot like deja vu

[Bridge: Richard and Mortimer]
Morty, I hate to break it to you
But what people call love
It's just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed
It hits hard Morty, then it slowly fades

[Verse 2: David]
Never this confused, 'cause guess I'm really trying
Really just feeling used because all [? incoherent mumbling] start replying
[? Latin or some shit]
Thought you knew I was vegan
[? this time it's like Aramaic of something]
Stop playing like your name is Keegan

Kill it, [? at this point David is having a stroke]
Just know me I did more than I shoulda and coulda
So I hope you appreciate it

[Verse 3: Andy]
Appreciate it
[? ching chong]
I'm always on my grind
[? ching chong part 2]

[Verse 4: David and Travis Scott]
Ever since you lied to my face
Kinda feels like you scarface
Things never really been the same
Always because you play that card game
Trippin' like shoelace
Sippin' like you [? no human can comprehend this]
{?}
(yeah)

[Verse 5: Brian]
I hope you don't confuse it for the music [?]
[mumble rap but it actually sounds bad]
'Cause every time I saw a picture of us standing together [?]
Retweet
But now [? please stop] crazy men-ta-lly yo
Gotta keep on moving, windmill
Even if it hurts, gotta pay off my bills

One at a tehm, would never do it again
You never ask [?]
'Cause when I'm walking through the streets, thinking about the defeats
It's pretty easy to realize so I don't want to repeat

But now it's 2018
I get to start it off clean
I think I found myself a queen and she know what I mean
I'll be happy with her, my feelings are sure
'Cause every time I'm with her, heh the past is a blur

[Chorus: David]
Gave you my all, but do you even care at all
I gave you a call, but you don't seem to recall
Always been there for you, never got a single thank you
Was I just a fool and start to look a lot like deja vu
