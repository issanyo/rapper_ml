[Hook: Shad Da God & T.I]
Yeah, you know I'm ridin' with that sig (hol' up!)
Come through in that Benz playin' big (I say hol' up!)
And we blow that gas, you can smell her (turn it)
Ain't shit chu could motherfuckin' tell us (turn it)
Man I heard a fake one talkin' slick bout the kid (hol' up!)
Tell the hoe we playin' with the paper like a kid
Bankroll they neck, that's the shit they just throat
Hit the green lights, everybody on go (and you know it man)
Yeah, that's the motherfuckin' kid, bitch
You know I got my city, bitch
I say, you could get your wig split

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Go on and let me dim the white light, burn the white candles
Get a white girl out her white dress, down to white sandals (ya dig?)
The only stars in astrology that's making profits
Prophets on the rocket, like my city, we don't need the comet
And all that blasé, blasé, all that nonce, nonce
My girl look like a Nicki Rihanna, Minaj, Grande Yonce
There he go on a pedestal, you need better dude
I told her that ABC not ABC, no public school they want to steel
Still pushing packs, pushing on some mule shit
I'm over nightin' and lbs relaxed on some cool shit
When the sun go down we jump around we off the shits
Don't under digg, the kids

Yeah, you know I'm ridin' with that 6 (hol' up!)

And we blow that gas, you can smell her (turn it)
Ain't shit chu could motherfuckin' tell us (turn it)
Man I heard a fake one talkin' slick bout the kid (hol' up!)
Tell the hoe we playin' with the paper like a kid
Bankroll they neck, that's the shit they just throat
Hit the green lights, everybody on go (and you know it man)
Yeah, that's the motherfuckin' kid, bitch
You know I got my city, bitch

[Verse: Spodee]
Yeah its the motherfuckin' kid bitch
You know I got my sig bitch
You can get your wig split

My shoes from Italy fuck you ain't feelin' me
Cause issues we ain't livin' it makin' mills for my children
Steady stackin' my bills without Hillary
In the streets a nigga plugged in like auxiliary
God willing I keep killing all these tracks and shit
I been selling crack so long I got calluses
Wrapping mid up that just fell of a big truck
Ridin' with sticks cause I got a name I'm establishin'
Blunt filled wit' green, pockets filled with cabbage
Word to ? we some young money savages
I just called two hoes and they gon' blow me like a clarinet

[Hook: Shad Da God & T.I]
Yeah, you know I'm ridin' with that sig (hol' up!)
Come through in that Benz playin' big (I say hol' up!)

[Verse : T.I.]
Designer, on my momma
Fresh shit like Obama, I probably get that going wind
See all the brick we just be blowin' them
Hustle gang
Listen up if I say a duck or pull a truck
Don't ask something, .45 hook your lil ass up
And guess what
If I see a flick or pull a tree

But don't be starin' at me
Man I'm a G, thats some shit today you rarely see
I been trappin' since all I day was a prayer and a key
Man, ou get caught I bet you sing like a parakeet
They say the proof is in the pudding, you don't see it, ain't lookin'
Man I-I-I'm certified, spread from Cali to Brooklyn
In the chi, I'm providing all the hoods with sugar
I'm super solid, pure gangster til my casket
Respect or we gon' blast for that

[Hook: Shad Da God & T.I]
Yeah, you know I'm ridin' with that sig (hol' up!)
Come through in that Benz playin' big (I say hol' up!)
And we blow that gas, you can smell her (turn it)
