[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Man man man, Momma Be Trippin
See Tony got the Jeep and I'm ready to whip it
Just packing the techniques, and we rockin' the Key
Club, roll up the dub, club showin' us love nobody givin' a fuck
Can't fit in the truck all my homies is here
So tell me who rollin with us?
From Chicago to Houston, to NY yeah we do this
We bumpin' the music, so get drunk and get stupid
You know nobody givin' a fuck about (Last night)

[Hook]
Now now now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
(You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like) (Last night)
Now now now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about...

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
Two twins and they naughty
They both ridin' shotty
It's a Friday and you know we ready to party
We hit the college in Malibu where there's hotties
They givin' us knowledge all while I'm drivin' they daddy's 'rari
In the dark with no worries, we ain't in a hurry
I might just swerve and hit the curb (skrrt)
We all too drunk to be scared (skrrt)
Outta here higher then the atmosphere
Yeah they ballin', but no Spalding
Make a killing but no coffin
And when we make it we gonna puke all over Vegas
And we were under the influence when we made this
So you gonna tell your DJ, "DJ DJ play this"

[Hook]
Now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
(You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like) (Last night)
Now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about...

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
It's the Vendetta
No tarot cards could tell me we trendsetters
Everybody out tonight it couldn't of been better
Ain't nobody fight tonight except for the bartenders
We threw up our mom's dinner
So tell what you trying to do?
Me and my homies got the loot so we trying to boot
Her and her breast full off the booze it's a party for two
Hotel room numbers and late night food runners
Summary of the whole summer, but can't seem to remember
From the fall of September, most of we can't remember
From the Spring to the Winter, couldn't tell you my dinner
Wish I could tell you what I did back in my past life
So how the hell you
Think I could tell you about last night?

[Hook]
Now throw your hands in the sky if you too fuckin' high to remember (Last night)
(You only live one time so we gonna party tonight like) (Last night)
Now throw your middle fingers up if you don't give a fuck about (Last night)
If you don't give a fuck about...
