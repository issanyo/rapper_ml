[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don’t stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one

[Interlude: Jeremih]
Ahh, ahh-uh
Ahh-uh, ahhh-uh
Ahhh-uh, ahhhh-uhh

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Alright, alright
We 'bout to take off, sit tight
Link up, get right
Have my Velveeta, we'll have a good night
Tip her, tip her
It make her cum quicker, quicker
Having you for dinner, dinner
Make me wanna put it in ya’, in ya'

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one
