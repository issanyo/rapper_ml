[Chorus 1]
If you drinkin', pour it up
If you smokin', light it up
In the H we get it shawty
Yeah that's my type, yeah that's my type

[Verse]
Oh, it's so amazin'
Good god that ass is gracious
Feel like I'm on top of the whole world
Goddammit, it's amazin'
Plottin' how we gon' do it, we shot
We pull up to my-
Pull up to Vegas and strip
And still man of the month
Yeah, there's so much in the jet

[Chorus 2]
We can go straight to moon like (voilà)
We can disappear from this world like (voilà)
Another sip and I'm gone like (voilà)
Baby, it's easy come and follow me to paradise
So come and follow me to paradise

[Chorus 1]
If you drinking pour it up
If you smoking light it up
In the H we get it shawty
Yeah that's my type
Yeah that's my type

[Chorus 2]
We can go straight to moon like (voilà)
We can disappear from this world like (voilà)
Another sip and I'm gone like (voilà)
Baby, it's easy come and follow me to paradise
So come and follow me to paradise

[Chorus 1]
If you drinking pour it up
If you smoking light it up
In the H we get it shawty
Yeah that's my type

If you drinking pour it up
If you smoking light it up
In the H we get it shawty
Yeah that's my type
Yeah that's my type  (voilà)  (voilà)
