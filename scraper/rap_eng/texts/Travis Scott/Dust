[Verse 1]
Ashes, dust to dust
Death all on her mind, don't let her fuck it up
Fucking with these hoes make you put it up
At least Adam and Eve got to bust a nut
High of the blow just bought another nose
And I might pull off in that Ghost like where that nigga go?
Doctor gave her double D's cause she heard a nigga flow
Whoa, she move the nigga aside cause he ain't important
She turn that
Cigarette to ash and watch it hit the dust
Girl quit playing yeah you know that nigga boring
Not too many in leather pants that can fuck with us
Now let us dance while I throw the dust
Ashes, to dust to dust
Know they all throw they hands cause they fuck with us
So many bitches bob and weave but they don't bob enough
Now these bitches mad look what I done started up
Put that whip outside, I hit the key it started up
I told them kiss my ass while I hit the dust
I hit the weed then I hit the gas
So much gold you think a nigga broke
So we gon' pull of trunk first so that you niggas know
With an Irish centerfold but all she know is Adido
Damn my momma proud a nigga made it out the moat
Where the sun always shine yeah but not no more
We party in the jungle till its time to go
So everybody rumble as they hit the floor
And if the world end it don't matter cause we bout to blow

[Chorus]
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see

[Verse 2]
Driving 108 don't crash and hit the rail
Don't look deep in her eyes you might see hell
32 to 34 not that O'Neal
So many hours, after hours in hotels
What a crazy night, I ran away from home just to change my life
Remember when my niggas told them owls came out at night
So now we bout to touch the sky, just to play in the night
Caught me standing now I'm in there standing, we staying the night
Daddy left but that nigga never said goodnight
Man that wasn't right, now I want all the power
Expected a lot from that coward
And any second I'm bound to wow ya, all them beats I dealt
For like two years momma all them beats I felt
I can massage my own dick I don't need your help
And I can crash my own whip, I don't need your belt
Tell me where the fuck was you when I couldn't feed myself
And all that wack shit help me be myself
I swear I never

[Chorus]
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
If the world crashing down, would you be here with me?
That's all I would die to see
