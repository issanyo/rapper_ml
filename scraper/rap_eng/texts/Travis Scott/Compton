[Intro:]
Sorry I'm late man
I had a map and everything man
And somehow I ended up in Compton
Where is he? He's sick
Sick my dick! He's probably somewhere fucked up!

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Dozed off in this cabin
Wake up seeing kegs and bitches, don't know what happened
Fuck I'm late for work ??? trippin' cause I'm blackin'
Always super blasted
Skinny and I'm tatted grab my keys and my sunglasses
Then I'm gone

[Verse 2: Jason Eric]
And took that Benz out on the road
And we living like we made it, buying shit we can't afford
These hoes be wylin', let her whip it she smilin'
Stoner chick, let her hit even when I let her drive it
(Drive it, drive it, drive it, drive it..)

Uh
I wake up in this cabin
All I hear are bitches
Walk in the room, Tony mackin'
They say Trav left for work
These chicks swingin' something ???
Always got me blasted
After dome hit the sto' get swishers while she at it
Dude I'm throwed

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
Versace for cologne
Hit my homies up, see what's up
When I clock out we can roll and hit the sto'
With more chicks that's down to roll
They all speakin' different language
Grab Rosetta's just to bone

[Verse 4: Jason Eric]
Hop in the back, she jump straight on me
I say I wanna fuck her tats
She say she want me
Ok

[Interlude:]
Ohhh, ayeee, ohhh, ayeee, ohhh

[Verse 5: Jason Eric]
Uh
Ain't it strange, spendin' this change
And how I've changed
This niggas talkin' shit
Runnin' they mouth
And I'm runnin' the game
Chiefin' cali bud in 50 states
English chick run her mouth 4 different ways
And I'm gettin' laid

[Verse 6: Travi$ Scott]
I'm feelin' myself
Chick whiter than milk
Chanel for the belt
Not runnin' no game
She pullin' Dwayne
Even tatted the name
Helicopter that bitch black and yeller
Bags of feathers
Changin' weather
Yo shit made of leather
And you's a bitch

[Verse 7: Jason Eric]
And I'm OG
She callin' me Chess
I'm all in her mouth
My name on her chest
She know what I'm 'bout
So I'm checkin' her text

[Outro:]
Ohhh, ayeee, ohhh, ayeee, ohhh
