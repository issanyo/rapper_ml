[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wake up in the morning, throwin' on them Nikes
Runnin' through that check, shout my nigga Phil Knight
Oreos in Oregon State, pop twenty pills in the night
Goin' a thousand miles in another state
They ain't oreos but they bright
Clap it break that back, she just made a stack
Niggas in that trap still totin' them straps
If you make it where I'm from, It's like a lone star in the sky that's all black
A "ménage à trois" with black dykes, damn
That's the new civil rights
Accidentally walked in the club, all these bitches bite
Told my mama fuck a major, best decision of my life
Now niggas in the corridor, I'm velvet down to my corduroys
Got bottles by the cases, pussy by different races

[Verse 2: Gunplay]
Purp in my itch palms, red lips six inches long
Took her like a hooker now come get your Shaun
I left her outside, I left her mouth dry
Feed her to the mountain lions, cause that bitch try countin' mine
Pussy, nigga yous a pussy nigga just a pussy nigga
You be doushin' I be pushin' ether
Bitch, you fuck boy cunt
Won't be satisfied until I see ya'll sufferin' in the sun
Chiefin' while I'm beefin' turn me odds to evens
My lawyers are some heathens beat it
Blowin' on some on reefers
If you didn't want a war, then why you'd wage it then?
I only wear jeans, I could fit a gage up in
I'm so high right now look like from Japan
Amazing, junkie jit came up major in
Trench team, ten deep, red beam, laser tag
Bring it, what you got police and pistols don't phase your man

[Hook: Gunplay]
I had to get her right
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
I had to get her right
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Look up at my eyes and I know you see a bad guy
Try to front on us, man you better ask them last guys
Suicide doors pull up when we ride by
Goon niggas hop up with guns fuck a drive by
Smokin' weed on the jet, bitch I'm fly high
You don't wanna give me neck? Bitch, bye bye
On to the next bitch, I hope she bi bi
Cause I love bitches that love bitches that love bitches
Fuckin' on they friends and I love fuckin' on they sisters
Bad bitches roll my swishers, God damn I'm that nigga
Smokin' on that reefer thinkin' how can I get richer
Damn shawty bad like the old Detroit Pistons
Damn I wanna fuck when I hit I'm gettin' misses
Treat her like shit man its fuck-a-bitch feelings
Money stacked tall man it's touchin' my ceiling
Money stacked tall man it's touchin' my ceiling

[Hook: Gunplay]
I had to get her right
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)

[Verse 4: Travi$ Scott]
Holy moly
All them niggas dead
All them pussies fed
Let em live? meh
Young owl in the dark
Thought he'd make it, never
Do you hate cause they know
I'mma be here forever (straight up)
Never fuck with the black and blue
Duck cause a nigga might shoot
Shocked what a nigga might do
Young nigga blessed like a nigga AH-CHOO (bless up)
In the Mo they smokin' raw diesel
Evil Knievel whip pullin' off in the dust (skurrt! skurrt!)
Throwin' flame rocks when a bitch might jerk (straight up)
Bouncin' this bitch like it's tennis
Vitches still eatin' at Denny's
Hotels phones I'm talkin' that business
Came up with the ones that was with me
Besides nigga, your niggas facade, nigga
She off shoe with that Snooki
Don't fall in love with that pussy (straight up)

[Hook: Gunplay]
I had to get her right
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
That pussy changed my life (straight up)
