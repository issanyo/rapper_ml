[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rockstars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind X2

[Hook]
But the nights keep fallin hey
What if the night keeps fallin hey X2

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Summer time was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with will&rich and kwazi motos
So we popped the champagne so drunk spilled liquor all over her vera wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: QuiZzY]
White girls lying to their mum for the lines
Black boys do the crimes for the lines
You dealing or buying or you're way out of line
We be speaking to the tyrants that be twinkling and shinin
Bitches crying rivers cuz I left em behind
Got that liquor in my liver while I trip and recline
This bitch keep callin but im clicking decline
We live in a time,where the shit in our mind
Is to get on our grind,im ruthless for the paper
I spit the truth in the booth,and I ain't care about a hater
Plus im getting high, got a pack of northern lights
My sword is bright,ive sworn to fight as the warrior night
To protect those who sold their souls over night
So if you get in our way you will get pulverized
Im a monster, you better run bitch
You lucky that the night is over, see you at sunset

[Hook]
