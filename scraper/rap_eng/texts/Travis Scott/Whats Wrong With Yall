You hating on me
You ain't on my team
You wish to be me

Temple of the haters the pastor is a hater his preaching and hating on me

(Verse 2:MTL rhythm)
I'm sipping this drank
Am too fucking drank
Hope on a track
Too fucking dope coz am taking the crack
The beat is a trap
I kill it with rap
Best of all time
Thinking too fast in just seconds I rhyme
Transforming the game am optimus prime
Driving me crazy my rim on the slime
My fans in my back rocking my jam
They stick to my zone like am talking bout gum
Your fans are too lame broke I give em a dime
Son of a bitch I don't give a damn
I'm Kendrick Lamar messing the game
I'm feeling too juicy I just met your fans
They asking for selfies they just wanna dance
The sound is my money am talking bout bandz
Too keep it all simple bandz
Make em dance
Chorus:MTL rhythm)
Now tell me ma nigga × 2

Now Tell me my nigga what's wrong with y'all
You hate on a nigga what's wrong with y'all
Now Tell me my nigga what's wrong with y'all
You hate on a nigga what's wrong with y'all
(Verse 3:Travis Scott)
Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing
