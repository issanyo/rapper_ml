Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope, straight from Mexico call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope...

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Praise to the pope, bless you with this dope
Step into my world where we get ghost, cause in my mind we float
Everytime we step into 1oak, they tweaking off the coke
Fuck I'm out my mind, I'm burning bread so much lets have a toast
My niggas and momma know that if I wasn't here, nigga I'd be dead
Now I'm in the building thinking billions counting millions, what a feeling
'Member when I never ever made shit?
Now me and my niggas rocking chains and whipping slave ships
Now who the slave bitch?

[Hook]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope, straight from Mexico call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope...

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
Straight from the lair or Himalayas
I got more keys than the mayor, let's have a prayer
Kelly Divine off in my pager, I'll hit her later
Dawn to dusk I'm trying to get made, I been up for days
Damn I'll never pop another pill, man that shit is real
Girl you know you fucking with La Flame, you know you know the drill
I reach to the heavens, lord forgive me I sin
May La Flame live forever, and always bring 'em in

[Bridge: A$AP Bari]
La Flame, don't play no games
These niggas is lames
These niggas ain't lords, we the new lords
Lord
(Mercy me, oh, mercy me)
(Mercy me, oh, mercy me)
(Mercy me, oh, mercy me)
(Mercy me, oh, mercy me)

Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope...
