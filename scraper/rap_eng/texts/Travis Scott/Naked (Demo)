[Intro: Rick Rubin]
The power of nature is such that it's what all art strives to be

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world

[Verse 1]
Last week was the last week
I turned my back and let my ass greet you
Dropped out and subtracted some niggas
An' made more than my math teacher
Lookin' dead in the mirror, lookin' back how we did it
Makin' trips to them dealers, guess it paid off nigga
Sip this wine in fine clarity
Marijuana, the youth therapy
Swervin' on my old hoes that drove to insanity
I guess that was all straight out of vanity
To my kids, that was plan to be
That was all, the inhumanity
Life's an adventure, with a lot of action
Lucky I'm fresh, in the Dime fashion
A class act, called a class act
Funny, lookin' back, wonder where my class at

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
(Fell out of love, feel like the Royal Rumble)

[Verse 2]
Fell out of love, feel like a Royal Rumble
Hard to be humble when you rock in the jungle
Stumblin', everybody was stumbled
Over that dresser, [?] in that bezel
In the den, left it in the vessel
Poor girl, ain't even the show girl
[?] overload [?] you know girl
[?] fantasize [?] to blow girl
Blowjob, only your own job
[?]
[?] creek, sat in the [?]
She left off the Dawson's Creek
Pausin' the [?] power, might take a thou
Awesome [?]
[?] Throw me off another thou

[Chorus]
I just wanna live in my dreams
Life ain’t what it seems
It's so hard in this cruel world
Escape into the night
Look into my light, my eyes
Naked in this cruel world
