[Intro: Chris Holloway}
Have you ever
Have you ever

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Have you ever had somebody that you wanna touch
Gives your body brush, feels is too much
Love flows in the air, face full of blush
You're her first crush

[Verse 1:Chris Holloway]
Your body slowly captivates me
And baby i'm all over you
Soon as the chance presents itself to me
Cause another minute, means another guy
Trying to catch your eye
So this one chance
Imma take cause i want you girl
