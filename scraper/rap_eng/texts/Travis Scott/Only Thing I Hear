[Verse 1:]
My parents say that you'll never amount to much
They say that I should be careful cause you're bad luck
When I try to ignore them they say
"Listen up, This is how it will be.."
I get so tired of listening to everyone
Tell me what should I be feeling, what I should want
So I try to ignore them but it never stops
I just can't get any peace

[Chorus:]
As I wander to your side of town each day
Where the windows are barred
And hopeless lays on the street
All the noise disappears
You're the only thing I hear

[Verse 2:]
What they don't know is that I am a lot like you
It doesn't matter that we have an ocean view
Though it's all picture perfect, unlike me and you
They just fight all the time, and
I get so tired of listening to everyone
Tell me I have everything that a girl should want
Because under the surface this place is corrupt
I just can't get any peace

[Chorus]
As I wander to your side of town each day
Where the windows are barred
And hopeless lays on the street
All the noise disappears
You're the only thing I hear

[Bridge:]
When there's thunder in the sky (you're the only thing I hear)
And the sirens blare at night (you're the only thing I hear)
When there's gunshots in the street (you're the only thing I hear)
There's no place I'd rather be (you're the only thing I hear)

[Chorus]
As I wander to your side of town each day
Where the windows are barred
And hopeless lays on the street
All the noise disappears
You're the only thing I hear
