[Intro]
This is all

[Chorus 1]
Bad-bad news
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between, yeah (This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)

[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I had you?
Trust me, you would be mad too (This is all)
Shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move
Plus, I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
(This is all, this is all)

[Chorus 2]
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, yeah, back in the bathroom line (This is)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you
Don't worry, I'll be back for you
All the money and cars, stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean, reflecting on all you see
(This is all, this is all)

[Verse 2]
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (This is all)
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope
Some shit only me and the Lord knows
SOS is for those who hear this in morse code
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes
This shit'll have you in divorce court
Fighting over your seeds
Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys
Alimony and fees
As your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news

[Chorus 1]
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean anything in between
(This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line, yeah (This is all)
