[Intro: Travis Scott]
I'm fine
Fine, I'm fine
Fine
Fine, fine

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine (straight up, straight up!)
I just wanna have the time of my life
I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine
I just wanna have the time of my life (straight up!)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I don't really (yah!) I don't really care if a nigga don't like me (yah yah!)
Other than a wife, I got everything I need (everything I need)
A house in the hills I'm finna go buy me
Plenty more Y-3, hatin' ass niggas ain't got cheese

[Verse 1: Cyhi The Prynce]
When I was outside in the summer
Back when we was sellin' 3-5 for the hunnid'
Boy you gotta' get it, can't rely on your momma
Used to wash cars on the side for some money
'Til I learned my OG's, got the pies in abundance
Down 85, get a thousand an onion
Can't lie, fucked up the first pound I was fronted
All I ever wanted was a house in the country, huh
Bought the condo with the kiosk
At the tree top, that's where we are, huh
So don't worry about me, dawg
You couldn't walk a day in my Reebok
Seen a lot of homies laid up in the ER
Naggin' ass hoes, we don't need y'all
Just got back from the D-R
She tried to give me something, I told her, "Sweetheart..."

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine (straight up, straight up!)
I just wanna have the time of my life
I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine
I just wanna have the time of my life (straight up!)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I don't really (yah!) I don't really care if a nigga don't like me (yah yah!)
Other than a wife, I got everything I need (everything I need)
A house in the hills I'm finna go buy me
Plenty more Y-3, hatin' ass niggas ain't got cheese

[Verse 2: Cyhi The Prynce]
Since a peewee, I came a long way, huh
Young nigga comin' home late
Found out what a zone weighed, kept my phone paid
Now I'm getting guap if you don't say
Bought my girl a rock from the Stone Age
Culinary art, this is gourmet
I done helped everybody else eat, dawg
Now it's time for me to put some money on my own plate, huh
Put my momma in that new thing
My father like Obama with the suit game
Niggas wanna know how much my funds worth
Fucked around and went and got a Mulsanne
We ain't hit the club with the loose change
Huh, me and all my Wu-Tang
This bitch could be empty tonight
Just as long as all my crew came

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine (straight up, straight up!)
I just wanna have the time of my life
I'm fine
Don't be worried 'bout me, my nigga, I'm fine
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine
I just wanna have the time of my life (straight up!)

[Outro: Pastor Cortez Harris & Travis Scott]
I just wanna have the time of my life
Dear God, we thank You now
For what eyes have seen, ears have heard and hearts have felt
I just wanna have the time of my life
Thank You for walking with us
God, thank You for talking with us
For You tell us that we are Your own
And because of that, there is a joy we share as we tarry there
Because our stepping stone was just a building block
I just wanna have the time of my life
And You've opened so many doors for us
Now God bless us, as we move higher
Bless us, as we fly higher
Lift us, as we move higher (time)
And God we'll be so ever careful, to bless Your name
I just wanna have the time of my life
For You work the night shift with us
And You kept us when we didn't keep ourselves
We love You, we thank You, and we bless You
Jesus name we pray, amen
I just wanna have the time of my life
Yeah, time
I just wanna have the time of my life
