[Hook: Alexanderdee]
Im half the devil, half these people ain't prosper, these fake people these fake people impostors, U.K supporting Matt on to the next grime, they alive now, till the next time, Next time, Next time, you alive now till the next time, Next time, Next time

[Verse 1: Alexanderdee]
Going on to the next one on to the next one, Louie bags capped on these XXL freshman, new tunes sounding so bad i can't protect them, use to be able to but now I'm up for suggestions, Mainstream trashing the blessings, plaining the music paintings looking like messed shit, aka its depressing, Guns tucked in pants in the streets of Detroit, shining off the rappers who making the shit noise, U.K Ard Bars rappers is the voice

[Hook: Alexanderdee]

[Verse 2: Alexanderdee]
Take them pretty status's and shove em up your asses's, ain't no word?, give a shit, rappers do it in a blink, rappers be like "I'm on one, what u got son?, you a pussy hater i bought rum" "Tunchie, got it on the triple level, pussy up, i will get it", chop your heads with a mallet, group of fucking 22 years with nothing that contains talent

[Hook: Alexanderdee]

[Vocal bridge: Travi$ Scott]
Whoa Whoa Whoa

[Verse 3: Alexanderdee]
On the track acting so mental, bout to go spaz like happy days ungentil, we listen to anything with a fucked rhyme, now your alive till the next time next time whoa whoa

[Vocal Outro: Travi$ Scott]
Whoa whoa whoa
