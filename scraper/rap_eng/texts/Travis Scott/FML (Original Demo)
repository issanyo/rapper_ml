[Into: Kanye West]
I been waiting, for a minute
For my lady
Pour out, ayy
Pour out, everyday, you know

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
I don't care, but I'm closer now
When I'm on, an' we gon' light the light up
Help me out when I'm goin' down

[Verse: Kanye West]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Had more than another episode
Last down I'm down in Mexico
Asking me why the hell I test the cove
Four times I say don't test me, hoe
Told you four times don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Don't stop your loving
Don't stop for nothing
No, not for nothing
They don't wanna see me love you
Nah, don't stop it
They always love it
They always wanna
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you
They don't wanna see me love you

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
Wish I would let a hater fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
Sunday night, I just might have to pipe up
You gon' have to get used to me
