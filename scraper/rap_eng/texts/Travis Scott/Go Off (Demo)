[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott, Both]
One more ride (ride)
One more race (race)
We go all out (all out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'mma go off (yah, yah)
I'mma ride tonight (yah)
It don't matter what we face
I'mma go off (straight up)
I'mma ride tonight
I'm the master of my fate
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Takin' off and I'm ridin' on the road now
Hit the gas, no brakes, gotta go now
Put my life on the line, yeah, it's on me
Blood rushin' through my veins, no IV
Ride, switchin' lanes, you can't stop me
You can smell the propane when you pass me (Propane)
Ride for the gang because I'm the chief (Gang, gang)
Helicopter hoverin', it's high speed
Chase, drive, straight (Drive)
I'mma, race, to the, cake (Cake, drive)
Flame, on it, no chain, on me (On me)
All of, us, became, homies

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott, Both]
One more ride (ride)
One more race (race)
We go all out (all out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'mma go off (yah, yah)
I'mma ride tonight (yah)
It don't matter what we face
I'mma go off (straight up)
I'mma ride tonight
I'm the master of my fate
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Nine-nine, nine-nine (Yah)
You're rockin' with the ether child in overdrive (Yah, yah)
Yeah, yeah, I-5 to I-9
We go all niiiiiight, yeah (Ooh, straight up)
Double 0 speed, double 0 Chevy (Yah)
I hit the fourth gear, hope I don't drift (Yah, yah)
Souped up cars all around me (Yah, yah)
Hot-boxin' at a high speed (Yah, yah)
One lane drivin' (Ooh-ooh, yah)
Bad thing 'side me (Ooh-ooh, yah)
One more time on the road (It's lit)
One more time 'fore we go (Straight up)

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott, Both]
One more ride (ride)
One more race (race)
We go all out (all out)

I'mma ride tonight (yah)
It don't matter what we face
I'mma go off (straight up)
I'mma ride tonight
I'm the master of my fate
I'mma go off

I'mma go off
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
Gotta go now
Gotta go, swervin' in my whip can't slow down (Skrrr)
Drivin' fancy cars, boy, I'm on the road now
Automatic start, my Vic take a code now
Yuh, rockstar, heavy metal, no guitar
Why you pay so much for yo' Nissan? Because it's GTR
First, I shift it, click it, burnin' rubber like I'm movin' dark (Yah)
Drive at night, I chop my top so I can relate to the stars
Yeah, relate to the stars
I'mma race you for a pink slip
I got nitrous in my car so tell me what you thinkin'
My adrenaline start pumpin' so I been stopped blinkin'

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott, Both]
One more ride (ride)
One more race (race)
We go all out (all out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'mma go off (yah, yah)
I'mma ride tonight (yah)
It don't matter what we face
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now

[Verse 4: Offset]
Ride in a Coup√©, I'm all alone now (ride)
In the fast lane, I can not slow down (skrrr)
I gotta watch my back when I go out
Cause the people that had my back a bunch of sellouts (hey)

[Verse 5: Takeoff]
If they jail me up right now, bet I'll bail out (bail out)
Me and 12 engines in the rear now (rear)
Always doubted me, but tell 'em that we here now (where?)
No negativity, focused on my career now
No, I will never back down (no)
Race game I'm Dwayne with the smack down (oh)
He can go pound for pound better ask how (uh-huh)

[Chorus: Quavo, Travis Scott, Both]
One more ride (ride)
One more race (race)
We go all out (all out)
We don't play
One more ride, one more race
We don't slow down, ain't no brakes
I'mma go off (yah, yah)
I'mma ride tonight (yah)
It don't matter what we face
I'mma go off (straight up)
I'mma ride tonight
I'm the master of my fate
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
I'mma go off
Yah, I gotta go now
