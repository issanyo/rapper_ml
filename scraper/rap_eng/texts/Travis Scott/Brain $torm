Brain storm, pick it up, oh
Hit up the mall, cop it all, oh oh, oh oh
Good go, sip it up slow
Good go, sip it up (Travis & Jason music)
Good go, sip it up slow
Turn up the radio, and off you go (oh-oh, oh oh)


Uh, yeah
[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
I swear this shit kinda fit funny
Finally getting laid and they went off and told on me
This stripper getting paid, getting rich is for broke dummies
Is she a snow buddy, let's yo money, (hmmm)
Here we go again, two more girls turn to four lesbiens
On the couch sexing em, sexing em, dawg
They look chewie

Great
But who gon if the bitch got a fake
I'm getting extra layed, you getting extra layed off! (Diamonds)
Then I'm gone, cause..

Stadium's packed, look who just blew in
Coming off the rebound like Patrick Ewing
Getting poe'd up with olders in Houston
Back when the bands Cruising
Stadium's packed, look who just blew in
Coming off the rebound like Patrick Ewing
Getting poe'd up with the oilers in Houston
Back when the bands Cruising
My brother told me that we could break the game
And when I woke, I swear that we would think the same
But what I think of life, I just think of as a game
But why didn't I spend a couple stacks on a chain
Please the company, can we bring on the beers?
Cheers, to the homies and the three musketeers
We getting hot all around global warming
Bust a nut now, all these chicks stay swarming
Churping, and when I wake up in the morning
I see the sun shine beaming on something foreign
I got a couple mags, full of jags
I let my pants sag, middle finger from the ass
Bitch!

(Im good right now, nice)

Damn, I've been wanting my own shit
When I get the hands out, like what I'm gon' get
Why do everybody gotta have some of yo shit
Why do everybody gotta have some of yo shit
Why do everybody gotta have some of yo shit
And when they don't get it, then they say you on hoe shit
Fuck y'all, what's mine that's mine
And when your shit original, the niggas tryna take your design
That may seem kinda sour, I was building the line
Broke niggas tell lies to make the greater decline
Now ain't that uncredible, I'm so incredible that I can take a fat bitch and make that hoe edible
Train rack medical, taste kinda professional
Square my niggas off, it's like they live in the sectional
Good shit, show it all, what you say? I'm hood rich
I don't have to rap about babesters that I would get
So much paper, I could probably make a book quick
Tell your girl to hold the stack, but I can make her look dick

Brain storm, pick it up, oh
