Tractory
Always from the people that you thought would never leave
Can't stop snitching by the leaves
Tryna steel my soul out in the hills
Caught my feels
Never thought to be again stuck in my feels
Oa oa oaaa
Show some more respect hoe
You been out your mind whoa
Never been for hating
But you leave me no choice
You won't kill my genius
Been in this place previous
Mirror on the wall
Who of them snitched me the most times in a row
