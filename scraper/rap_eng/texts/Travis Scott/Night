[Verse 1]
3 AM rolling stoned, all I see is dust
We feel like rock stars then we rockstars
Sex pistol posers, they never heard of us
I guess I need that white broad in that white car
So raise your glasses homie cause we seem to bring the masses homie
And shut down our whole town, fuck up shit
My homie Jon copped them grapes and they busted
Rollies and raviolis you in the cover of Vogue
Don't look between the lines or it'll fuck up your mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind
She let us smell the line, let it fuck up our mind

[Chorus]
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey

[Verse 2]
Summertime was the illest
Used to pull up the pullup like it was Christmas
Winter time furs is too cold, told 'em give me mine
Last night I had a dream but I died too many times
But fuck motto, when her breasts out tell em take some fucking photos
Fill up the dressing room with Will and Rich and Quasimodos
So we popped the champagne so drunk
Spilled liquor all over her Vera Wang
Its timeless but how many people here know what the time is
Spend about a minute on it
From the front row to the stage it feel different don't it
So I'mma shine while I'm here make it mine while I'm here

[Chorus]
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
But the nights keep fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
What if the night keeps fallin' hey
