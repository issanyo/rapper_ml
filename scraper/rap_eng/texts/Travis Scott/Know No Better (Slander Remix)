[Intro: Travis Scott]
Straight up, yeah

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wrist lookin' like it been dipped
Dipped in that, dipped in that, dipped in that
Script lookin' like it been flipped
Flippin' that, flippin' that, flippin' that (yah)
Pull up in that foreign, my God (skrrt, skrrt)
Whole squad get in that, get in that
Please say it ain't true, I had to go and cop two
Hell nah, we can't fit in that

[Pre-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Wild ones, like we fresh out the cage
Showtime, baby, fresh off the stage (yah)
Bad lil' mama, fresh off the page (yah, yah)
Front like you love it
But you know that you hate it
Yeah, you know no better
Yeah, you know no better (yah, yah)
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones
Who don't know no better (know no better)
'Cause, baby, I know you better
'Cause, baby, I know no better
Baby, I know you better (baby, I know...)
Baby, I know you...

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Better
Know you better
Said, I know you better
Know you better
Better

[Interlude: Quavo]
Quavo

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Drop top on the whip (drop top)
Dab of ranch on the chips (dab)
Ice cream gave her chills (ice cream)
Too much cash, pay the bills
I make her ride Mercedes (skrrt, skrrt)
I can afford the latest (ayy)
Baby, ignore the ratings (ignore 'em)
Just pull up, we pop out, we ragin'
We know no better (no)
Stack my bread up (stack)
Don't get fed up (nope)
Ain't gon' let up (yeah)
You told me to shut up (shut up)
But I'ma do better (huh?)
It's not my race (ooh)
Get out my face (get out)
Drop my case (drop it)
Which way? (where?)
Dat way (hey)

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Yeah, you know no better
Say you different, who you kidding?
Yeah, you know no better
Ooh, save that talk for the ones who don't know no better
'Cause, baby, I know you better
Maybe I know you better (straight up)
Maybe I know you

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Travis Scott]
Better
Know you better
Said, I know you better
Know you better
Better

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Straight up, yeah
