[Intro]
(La Flame)!

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
100 bottles but I might need some more
Shot after shot, but I might need some more
Spendin' money, guala, might spend some more
Let's be honest, I just might make a switch
100 bottles but I might need some more
Shot after shot, but I might need some more
Spendin' money, guala, might spend some more
Let's be honest, I just might make a switch

[Build-Up: Travi$ Scott]
Let me hit it, let me hit it, let me hit it
Let me hit it, let me hit it, let me hit it
Straight up!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
I'ma hit it like I'm Babe Ruth
Put your hand on your ankles
I'ma hit it on the dance floor
Let 'em see how I thank you
I know you a church girl
But you ain't no saint, boo
[?]
She eat the paint like Van Gogh, now girl
Girl, let me hit it
Your body's so Gucci
I beat that pussy blue
Now it's crippin' like it's [?]
Your pussy got me peeling
I be peeling like I'm kooky
Stick it in every hole
I'm the binder to your looseleaf
The binder to your looseleaf
She give head like she got no teeth
That girl fuck me good
I ain't tryna fuck her homies
I be lyin', I'm a young Ginuwine
I'ma hit it from the back, gonna break her spine
Gon' ride it like a pony, I'ma bust it like a nine
I'ma kill the coochie, let her [?]
Let me hit it, I'ma hit it
I'ma hit that pussy all night, all night

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
100 bottles but I might need some more
Shot after shot, but I might need some more
Spendin' money, guala, might spend some more
Let's be honest, I just might make a switch

[Build-Up: Travi$ Scott]
Let me hit it, let me hit it, let me hit it
Let me hit it, let me hit it, let me hit it

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I'ma hit that pussy like a dog
Sippin' on the Henny got me gone
Sippin' on the Henny got the [?] feelin' strong
Put your mouth on it, girl, smoke it like a bong
Young daddy long [?]
Hit it like Jackie Chan, rumbling around
Pussy's like Pakistan, girl you the bomb
Should've knew I was packin', that dingaling on your lung
In the Cadillac, headed to your mom's
You started to [?]
Claim you ain't want it, girl, but I got you in the zone
I think you was frontin', stuntin', but girl you want it all

[Outro: A$AP Ferg + Travi$ Scott]
Oh, I want it all from you
I'ma hit it so goddamn rude, I'ma hit it so good
Oh, oh
Let me hit it
Let me hit it
I want it all from you
Let me hit it
I'ma hit it so goddamn rude
Let me hit it
I'ma hit it so good
Let me hit it, let me hit it, let me hit it
La Flame!
Let me hit it
