[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Bit of vodka and juice
Yeah, yup, yup, yup

[Chorus: Travis Scott & London Jae]
Okay, alright
It's time right now
Go live (it's lit)
Bit of vodka an' some juice (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything keep me loose (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: London Jae]
Bitch you outta pocket, pocket rocket poppin'
Pop it at your noggin', like you keep it comin'
Stop it, stay on topic, shoppin' in the tropics
Drop the check deposit, [?]
Sunday to Sunday, I'm doublin' my profit
Hold the fuckin' phone, did this on my own
Hit the bitch I'm gone, have to keep it movin' gone way up
Mix the juice and the vodka, let's get it (yeah)
Cranberry Bentley, push it to the limit, through the ceiling
[?]
Rock the Presidential when I show out on a mission
I'ma take it up a notch, I got a motherfuckin' feelin'
Yeah, London gon' make a killin'
Dippin' through the city in a lo-lo
I be with my dog, call him Toto
He don't want no fucking photos
Nigga, win or lose, I'ma do the best yeah
Pickin' through these bitches leave the rest yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott & London Jae]
Okay, alright (yeah)
It's time, right now
Go live (it's lit, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bit of vodka an' some juice (yeah, yeah)
Everything keep me loose (yeah, nah, for real)

[Verse 2: London Jae]
Bank, bank account load it up with zero
Poppin' Percocet in the Matrix feelin' like Neo
40 load the chopper, I can shot you through the peephole (peephole)
Never goin' outside, beefin' by the P.O
Got a baddest bitch around with me, I don't need [?]
Twenty-thousand a month, my new crib ain't got a keyhole
Tryna stuff my pockets with them chips like Doritos
I just want the cheese like Cheeto
Catch me up in traffic, my whip is immaculate
I wish a nigga might try me, I promise I'm packin' it
[?]
Magic City Monday, I be throwin' the cabbage, bitch I'm havin' it
Racin' through the city, fuck the speed limit
Everybody pointin' like, "Who that?" That was me in it
Back to back to back to back, sittin' on 21 like a savage
[?]

[Chorus: Travis Scott & London Jae]
Okay, alright (yeah)
It's time, right now
Go live (it's lit, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bit of vodka an' some juice (yeah, yeah)
Everything keep me loose (yeah, nah, for real)
