[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah, yeah
It's like a whole different world, ooh
Buddah Bless this beat

[Chorus: Quavo]
Yeah (yeah), yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah
Saint Laurent Mask, yeah
Yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah
Pull up with a broom, do a street sweep (sweep sweep)
She addicted to CC (Coco)
Swag on repeat (drip drip)
Day by the day (day by the day)
Countin' that bag on the low (bag)
Count that bag on the floor (bag)
Stack it up 'til you get more (stack it up)
Stack it up 'til it get mold (stack it up)
Stack it up 'til it get mold
Stack it up 'til it get mold

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Ain't givin' out no freebee's
Swipe with the digital CC
Come get high, my teepee
Take them bars, no 3G, yeah
Live fast, live life easy
Pour a 'lil drop in my sweet tea
X-rated, no PG
Your ex-nigga on creepy

[Refrain: Quavo]
She don't wanna keep 'em
She fuck 'em then leave 'em (smash)
She hope I hit her (brr brr)
She hope I beep her (hope I beep her)
She want me to get her a bag, a house, maybe a Beamer (skrr skrr)
I might say some shit out of my mouth, but still won't leave her

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I might say some shit out of my mouth, call my paralegal
I did done some shit in my life ridin' in that Regal
Go Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, that shit lethal
Can't live backwards, live life, that shit evil

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Mask and grab the safe (mask)
I bet you niggas canâ€™t re-up (no)
Bulletproof Wraith, safe (bulletproof)
Recline it, I let my seat up (dope)
Huncho Jack, we the robbers (brrt)
Huncho Jack, got a chopper (Huncho)
You might want to keep this film rollin'
Huncho Jack, won an Oscar (hey)

[Chorus: Quavo]
Yeah (yeah), yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah
Saint Laurent Mask, yeah
Yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah, yeah (yeah), yeah
Pull up with a broom, do a street sweep (sweep, sweep)
She addicted to CC (Coco)
Swag on repeat (drip drip)
Day by the day (day by the day)
Counting that bag on the low (bag)
Count that bag on the floor (bag)
Stack it up 'til you get more (stack it up)
Stack it up 'til it get mold (stack it up)
Stack it up 'til it get mold
Stack it up 'til it get mold

[Bridge: Quavo]
Stack it, stack it, stack it
Stack it, stack it, stack it
Wrap it up, put it in the plastic
Wrap it up, wrap it up, put it in the plastic

[Refrain: Quavo]
She don't wanna keep 'em
She fuck and then leave 'em
She hope I hit her
She hope I beep her
She want me to get her a bag, a house, maybe a Beamer
I might say some shit out of my mouth, but still won't leave her
