[Verse 1]
Fuck outta my business
I did things that most men will ask forgiveness
Broke the code, the commandments from my descendants
Who gives a fuck? New children in the buildin' (step back)
Ride with no limits
Shut the fuck up, don't you hear me tryna finish?
I'm in a bad mood
I'm in a bad mood

[Verse 2]
Rob that dude, fuck that couch, burn that house
Hol' on, you too close
I keep a classy one for the toast
'Cause my ghetto one do the most
Man, I'm so serious
Don't fucking talk to me
I'm in a bad mood
Oooh, your skin mahogany
Oooh, let's break the monotony
Government threw us in a maze
Had me trickin' 40k for some grades
Just to make 40k for the wage
Dropped out and made that in one day
I'm in a good mood

[Verse 3]
Oooh, I'm wildin' on 'em, oooh back pilin' on 'em
I never feel the pain, only God can make it rain
So I must be Mary, Joseph, Allah
Kid of a disciple, these thoughts is suicidal
Jumpin' off a buildin', quit thinkin' like a psycho
They tryna find a nigga dead, Chris Lighty
Anxiety after the meds, Kris Bobbi
