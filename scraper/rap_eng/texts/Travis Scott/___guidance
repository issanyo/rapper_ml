[Intro: Travis Scott]
And I found out that you're bad for me
I found out that you had someone
Every time I get this drunk
I hope I wake up in another place (roll up, roll up)

[Chorus: K. Forest & Travis Scott]
I roll up behind it (yeah!), I wanna try it (yeah!)
Grip on your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin' (straight up)
You're from the Islands, you stay wildin'
I guide, I guide you like a pilot

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Haven't been around this year (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I like to see you change your gears (yeah, yeah, yeah, it's lit!)
To a motion that's more faster, babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna catch up, babe

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Come through, follow me
Rumble, follow me (yeah!)
Rollin', follow me
Opt to, follow me (straight up)
Do you like that? Follow me
Nicest, follow me
Backwoods, follow me
Practice, follow me, yeah
Hop up, it's time for the switch (yeah!)
Lightskinned girls like the hair, man, it come with a twist
Badmon, badmon, yeah you know it come with a risk
Ain't a bouncer but the way you bouncin'
I might just frisk ya (yeah! yeah! yeah!)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I roll up behind it (yeah!), I wanna try it (yeah!)
Grip on your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin' (straight up)
You need some guidance, you stay wildin'
I'ma guide you like a pilot

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Haven't been around this year (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I like to see you change your gears (yeah, yeah, yeah, it's lit!)
To a motion that's more faster, (bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop) babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna (grrrrrah!) catch up, babe

[Bridge: Travis Scott & K. Forest]
And I found out that you're bad for me
I found out that you had someone
Every time I get this drunk
I hope I wake up in another place (roll up, roll up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
You silent, you quiet
What happened to the loud talkin'?
All that noise, you done?
Are you finished? Or are you done?
How you been wit your workout business?
Got my 'scription
Got my attention
You know my intentions
You know nobody know our business (oh)

Lit like my wrist is
Only like it when you're at your littest (it's lit!)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I roll up behind it (yeah!), I wanna try it (yeah!)
Grip on your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin' (straight up)

I'ma guide you (uh) like a pilot

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
Haven't been around this year (yeah, yeah, yeah)

To a motion that's more faster, babe
I'm grippin' like I'm tryna catch up, babe
