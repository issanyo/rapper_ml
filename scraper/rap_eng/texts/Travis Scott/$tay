[Hook]
It's time to walk away
It's time to walk away from you

[Intro: Travis Scott]
I've seen that she was smart and she had a pretty smile
I haven't seen a star in the sky for a while
With all of those diamond rings, all those fancy things
Since you're not stuck-up
I guess you don't have to get down on your knees
Unless you want to suck my dick
I guess you don't want to get down on your knees
(Knees, knees, knees)

[Verse 1: Jason Eric]
Came up in the party with 5 bitches on my dick
And then we packed a car with like 10 of them in my whip
I'm getting slonky that bass plays and the pumpin'
Neighbours stuck-up, always asking for something
Who gives a fuck? Yo, Slony keep poring up
Ally and Meghan brought 4 friends and they ain't drunk enough
Chip was fucking with 2 vegas, and Chop's gon' roll them up
Two fingers to these haters, pull that peace out her trunk
She wet as fuck, we car pullin' up out this truck
Fuck on this slut, now my ex tellin' me to come over bonin'

[Hook]
It's time to walk away
It's time to walk away from you

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wake up, cloudy, blasted out my mind
Shit, you know we OG scoopin' your change and flippin' your dime
Got them diamonds, party packin', it's jumpin'
Chicks stuck-up, frontin' and they drunk
Who gives a fuck? Tony keep twistin' up
The promoter from Vegas say he got chicks that's hot enough
Out of city of swangers and trucks, deuces and cups, swishers in Vegas, no guts, white chicks with butts
Gotta go and get the 'cohol let me bone
But, I hit that later 'cuz a nigga like me gotta get this paper, so

[Hook]
It's time to walk away
It's time to walk away from you

[Bridge 2: Travis Scott]
It's on, I'm drunk and now I'm stumblin'
I'm stoned, ain't leavin' till the mornin'
(It's on, I'm drunk and now I'm stumblin'
I'm stoned, ain't leavin' till the mornin')
It's on, I'm drunk and now I'm stumblin'
I'm stoned, ain't leavin' till the mornin'
(It's on, I'm drunk and now I'm stumblin'
I'm stoned, ain't leavin' till the mornin')

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Since you're not stuck-up
I guess you don't have to get down on your knees
Unless you want to suck my dick
I guess you don't want to get down on your knees
