[Hook: Travis Scott]
Watch me
Watch me get louder, get louder
Watch me, ooh, Watch me
Get louder, get louder
Watch me

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Watch me start standin' on the couches
Watch me start fuckin' on they spouses
Yeah, watch me start runnin' up announcements
Watch me start goin' up on the mountains
Watch me start, and I'll be here
Watch me start goin' up in here
I been goin' hard for a year
Goin' deep ties in the shit
Heartbroken, wanna m√©nage with me
Yeah, baby, it's a supersize side with me

[Verse 2: Azure The Paradox]
Said that she wanna come and slide with me
Yeah, she wanna come slide with it
She be getting jiggy ain't no Deadshot in it
Loud gets loud ain't no pretending
You ain't fucking with the team
Your side ain't winning
Accusing the court, I rise defendent
Hit them with the shit make it louder

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Watch me
Watch me get louder, get louder
Watch me, ooh, Watch me
Get louder, get louder
Watch me

[Verse 3: Azure The Paradox]
Watch when I start blowing up
Watch me when I whip it out the cup
Curry with the Wrist, Top ten topping the list
Pop a rapper Like a doctor popping a cyst
You never in the game you just dropping assists
Every track you drop its a flop or a miss
I be on the line steady popping the blitz
You calling it quits get dragged to the pits
Nick Grace with the fade it be alright
Vin Stape with the fade last all night
Like Projek with the black thoughts
Take it from a nigga I can never trust another thot
Track 10 I be going in like a beast
Pockets getting fat A nigga getting obese
Sifting through my heat new shit over old beats
Shits unfinished my nigga Trav told me

[Hook: Travis Scott]
Watch me
Watch me get louder, get louder
Watch me, ooh, Watch me
Get louder, get louder
Watch me
