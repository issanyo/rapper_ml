[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster
You riding up uptown
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speeding
Fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures
All my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank
And a little more drank than La Flame might need
Tito Puente with the candy top
Fuck around, make the Latinas pop
It's a new world order
Never had my head on my shoulders
Beware of the monsters
Ain't that what your preacher told ya?
La Flame, 500 degrees
From the uptown to the Magnolia

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel, ehh

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low
Got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious
Gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you lil' Yamamoto
Take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
Cause we got a little bit of Tango
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Bangin' wax since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weekend hell
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga
She can ride the dick no hands

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
While I'm riding uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
It's that young Fergenstein (Little Frankenstein!)
Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
Martin 'Giela so cold feel like Tommy gettin' his payday
Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy
My fraternity is the burna heat, Iâ€™m a Kappa nigga with an AK-ay
Barking loud like Q-Dogs, moving niggas like U-Hauls
Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown
