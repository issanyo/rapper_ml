[Verse 1: Jimmy B]


Okay / I’m from that SmashMouth clique/
You know Ponders, SeT respect that shit /
Sha The Prince with Flex & shit / Vader, AJ we rep that shit
Batman, MMac on the boards like Dennis Rodman check that shit
My dude Tay Lew what it do? Suge White saying we got next & shit
I can’t forget the Bass6 / Oh lord we bossing up
They pat me on my back like I’m coughing up
From my accomplishments fuck your acknowledgment
Getting brain from a girl I went to college with
Seems like success came instant damn
Heard one song became instant fans
I could fuck girls off Instagram
They brag about what they did but nigga what is you doing
Claim they the hottest in the city but who the fuck y’all influenced? Huh!
Your whole club in ruins, cash I’m pursuing
If y’all Maple Leafs than I’m more like the Bruins
My clique is the truest your clique looking foolish
I’m saving that money & stacking it up like I’m Jewish
Now all these girls sharing my DNA
I take white girls straight out they TNA & give ‘em D for days
They say I lead the way / Of this new fucking era
I’m from Toronto who the fuck I’m suppose to be scared of?
Half these dudes wearing mascara and eyeliner
The girl of my dreams I can’t find her
Because I’m blinded by these commas
And I never chase vagina, unless I got a condom to hit it
Hit it & quit it / Won’t say no names no I won't get specific
My flow is the sickest my girl is the thickest
My new girl so fine that I give her a ticket like damn it / Damn it
Damn girl you need to slow it down
I could take you to the ‘borough I know the town
Introduce you to ‘gunna’ we could blow a pound
She like me!? Oh my! / I love it when you get me high
Young Scarborough nigga from the east side
Wit a 40 ounce, Backwood full of that fire
Okay I’m the prince of the 416 / Prince of the ‘borough man I’m on my shit
Since L.O.R.D.S dropped they been on my dick
Ask around I’m the  king on my strip / Never had to walk with the thing on my hip
Whenever she talk got her thing on my lips
Make her give me brain till she fucking mindless
Niggas hitting Brenden up like where'd you find this / Nigga where'd you find this...Monster!
Had to hit them with that Ponders flow /You know that Ponders flow is phenomenal
SmashMouth CReW gang we be bombing hoes / Give her D she feel it in the abdominal
Young player man I’m fucking all kinds of hoes / You dick her down but I fucking anaconda hoes
You dick her down but I fucking anaconda hoes, like word / man this rap game is so stressful
But my first name Jordan dog so damn I got to be successful
Talking weed I got a chest full / Chasing dreams what I got to rest for
Talking cash what do I need cheques for / They talking cash but I see they cheques fold
Man the Lord so disrespectful / Rappers in my city joking
Fuck your brand new Jordan 6's & the fucking weed you smoking
Man salute my dude Raheem you know he rep for that Refill
Our teams are rolling, no E pill / These other rappers one tree hill
Been in the game for like 10 years / and oh my god you still so local
Run up on us at a show bro and ya you was actin loco
Should have put you in a chokehold / Or jus hit you wit that 4'4
You mad there's a brand new ***? / Oh ya hoe that was a low blow
Man these old heads need some promo / Dead bodies chalk them up
Instead of talking you should be bossing up /The new wave in the city and it starts wit us / and that’s the SmashMouth clique
You know Ponders, SeT respect that shit / Sha The Prince with Flex & shit
Vader, AJ we rep that shit / Batman, MMAC on the boards like Dennis Rodman check that shit / My dude Tay Lew what it do? Suge White sayin we got next & shit / I can’t forget the Bass6 / We taking it back to basics / Ye these rappers talk they ain't saying shit / Look at me then you looking at greatness / Buss a nut in her mouth make her babysit / That’s literally what you call baby sips
Ye that’s literally what you call baby sips!
