Intro: Tyler Devlin
I been on my vibe, on my vibe
I been on my grind, all the time
I been up all night, all my life
I been on my vibe, (on my vibe)

Verse: Tyler Devlin
Everyday, I been up late
So I can say finally
Momma you don't gotta worry I'm ok
Poppa you don't gotta hurt no more I'm gettin' paid
Sissy there's no need to miss me I could fly and see you anyday
You three are MVP's for me everyday

Hook: Travis Scott
On my vibe, on my vibe I've been drinkin'
Everytime, everytime, why we do this?
Spend my mind on my grind I'm not selfish
We break up then make up we can't help it
I've been sippin' I've been poppin' everything
Lets save some time we ain't gotta tell no names
They say they want a real one
They say they want a real one to make 'em feel young
Feel young, feel young

Verse: Tyler Devlin
Workin' everyday, I been up late
Since eleventh grade, flippin' everything
When I'm paid, switch dead presidents and get Benjamin's I been in the bank
At the ATM, ATM
Count it out, now I'm feelin' great
I'm just tryna' elevate
Why you drivin' in my lane?
Transform a Chevrolet
To a Lambo that's custom made
I been dreamin' bigger things than playin' Xbox or playin' with my ex's box
No time for bullshit today
Or anyday
Cause I been grindin' everyday
Everyday, everyday
Been up late, really late
Everyday, now
Everyday now, (x3)
I been grindin', I been workin'
I been mindin', my own business
I been hustlin', I been slavin'
I been up late, everyday and night, night
Represent my state, 406 MT
But now I'm In LA-X to take
Off, off
Cause I been
On, on, (on my vibe)

Hook: Travis Scott

Verse: Tyler Devlin
No time for grindin', I been grindin'
Everyday and night since
I been vibin', with this ignited fire inside of my mind
I just lit my flame, la flame
Set my head on gettin' paid
Been awake
Seven days straight and still ain't weak
Sometimes I just forget to sleep
Instead I dream
Been up late, everyday
Put that on everything
My momma, poppa, and sissy
My girl's been so patient
And waitin' for me to make it
I say quick, she wonderin' where this will take us
I say I know, even though I don't
I just know time I go close my night show
After that girl we ride over to my hotel we made it
You don't have to listen to me
Look at what that decimal say
Now I'm the man, step in the bank
They know who I am, remember my name
Started in a basement and stayed up on late
Nights to make myself a name
I been up late, everyday
Since eleventh grade
Now I'm in LA-X to take
Off, now I'm on top and not
Fallin' off oh my god I been on, (on my vibe)
