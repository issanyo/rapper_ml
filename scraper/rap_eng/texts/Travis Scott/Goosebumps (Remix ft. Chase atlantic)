[Verse 1]
Offered her a pill and now she all in
Took her from the hills, now we rollin'
Probably get her killed by the morning

Pedal to the motherfuckin' floor, man
Full acceleration, hear me roaring
Call the record label, why they stalling?
I don't think they understand importance

[Chorus]
Poppin' a pill with my left hand
Got my right hand on your girly
She rollin' off to the
Side side side
Why she up so fucking early?
I would fuck her but it's early
Pop another now it's hurting
Sip and driving got me swerving
Book a table, I'm reserving

[Verse 2]
Now it's feeling like a circus
Half the shit in here was worthless
Got you so, so deep in your feelings, wondering if you've got a purpose
Grab your friends and tell 'em work it
Everbody lookin' nervous
You come, coming to wreak havoc
I'll be sliding through, yeah it's certain

I just caught a motherfucking vibe, yeah
Tell that bitch you motherfucking right
I been doing whatever I like
You know I get those goosebumps every time

(Probably get her killed by the morning)

[Travis Scott Outro]
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
You come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worry about those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
