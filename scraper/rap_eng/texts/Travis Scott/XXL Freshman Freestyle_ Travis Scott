Lifted, I'm feeling so gifted, tripping, I'm constantly falling
Channel view of the whole villa, plotting while burning a Marley
Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whipping the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, since she's lamping with the trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway for the line
Listen, pimping your bitches might visit my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up crib look like the tele, left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth, I copped it but now I don't miss it
World found it, teeth probably glissing, in fact that nigga prolly missing

La Flame
