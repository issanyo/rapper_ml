[Verse 1:King Libra]
Our first kissed in zahn living room
Thats a hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
We smoked a huka in zahn bedroom
Thats a way hella way to end the night
A hella way to end the night
They caught us kissing in the bathroom
She put my hands on her gluteus maximum
Thats a hella way to end the night
Tonight (tonight)

[Bridge 1:Travis Scott]
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth
Thought I was in over my head, all my nigga's is dead

[Verse 2:King Libra]
2k14 spring break fever finna chill wit the homies and blow wit la china
All you can smell off me is the flavor off the huka we breathing
Sinatra ain't wit it so he sits there and watch meanwhile me and my korean goddess
Over here shotgunning damn who would know out all the things i been through
And out of all the niggas you couldve been with you choosed me
Im truly grateful because you saw something different outta all these other dudes
I regret talking to you know who instead you
But forget we finna to have a hell of a night
Libra la flare
These niggas is scared
Im dropping these bars
They ringing the alarm
They tripping they tweaking
And im stuntin and steezing
Man these fu fu niggas they too easy
Not even going in hard man im not trying to harm
Feeling some type a way because im quan
Im rich homie
Wait check it i only spit facts and imma end this song because thats a hella way to end the night
Yeah a hella way to end the night

[Bridge 1:Travis Scott]
I left my girl in the south, but this gold in my mouth

[Bridge 2:King Libra]
It's a hell of a night
