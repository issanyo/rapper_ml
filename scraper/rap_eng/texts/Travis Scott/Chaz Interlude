[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
Missed existence, I don't miss it
I can keep it, if I want it
There's nothing like it, it's not a secret
If the crux is a king, then I can fix it
Missed existence, I don't miss it
I can keep it, if I want it
There's nothing like it, it's not a secret
If the crux is a king, then I can fix it
