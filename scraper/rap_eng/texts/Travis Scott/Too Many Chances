[Instrumental Refrain]
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute (oh yeah)
Do it
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds

[Verse]
First order of business, I gotta fly out my people
Way too many fakes in my face, I can see the evils
Drug addictions, bad bitches
They gotta be chose, see the peacoat
Black slacks, it's R.I.P. clothes, see amigos
Laid back, I cock the nino, game time, gang time
No time to reload, handle mine, take mine
I've gotta deebo, can't waste a minute
Rap Yeats, I master business, but still a menace
Peep my mojo I got together, I'm in my bag
Too many looks, they pocket watchin', gotta hit the gas
Look back, I see the clouds, these niggas doubt
They say a nigga'd never make it, now look at me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hood times, I never cared, I pull up there
Outside your club, I'm at your club (yeah)

[Chorus]
An' I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers

[Instrumental Refrain]
Do it (oh, yeah)
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
Do it
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds

[Chorus]
An' I gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers
Gave myself too many
Gave myself too many chances
Gave myself too many chances
Alcohol land on these dancers

[Instrumental Refrain]
Do it (oh, yeah)
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds
Do it (oh, yeah)
If you can be real for two seconds
Or maybe a minute
Do it, don't be shy
If you can be real for two seconds
Do it, don't be shy
You know that I miss it, don't be shy
You know that, you know that
I don't go that way
