[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Okay, I got it, copy
20/20, but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies
No that wasnâ€™t my girl, that was just a hobby
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me
Yeah, yeah
X-ray vision, see through you niggas
Newspaper stand, we press the issue
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles
Right up at your hood, unload
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat
Driver run the miles up like I'm runnin' a track meet
Gotta watch my back now, cause these niggas at me
All black in a Benz when I pull up on you

[Hook: Travis Scott]
They don't want to see me in the ends, in the ends
Don't let me catch you creeping here past 10, in the ends
From the tribe called check-a-hoe like Indian

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, I'm a dog with the dog pound
Oh yeah, La Flame checkin' in with the heat now
Oh yeah, having to eat now
Oh yeah, you went Whiteside on the rebound
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, running through the 713 with the check
Our necks iced out got a whole lotta bet
Hit it from the don whole lotta young respect
Oh yeah, copping hella dome on my jet
Oh yeah, god dammit got a whole new collect
Yeah, yeah, I've been sipping got my home in a wreck
Oh yeah, I'mma do the deal now
In the ends we might come and kick the door down
Oh yeah, when I follow through you oh now
Oh yeah, she gon' hit the damn C note when I pull up on you
