[Hook]
I don't like Highschool, I'm just playing I love Highschool
Projects, dates, kickin' it with my classmates
Women in hotels, blowing sweets to the new Drake mixtape
Sip my liquor and just smoke all of my drugs
(Every night and every weekend there is a party where go)

[Verse 1: Jason Eric]
Man, I gotta get wit' her
Take her out and take my space pictures (cheese)
I ain't no fun to be staying out of trouble (trouble)
So we blow sweets of trees in the [??]
Hoping we don't get kicked out
Hey, be quiet!
I can't tell nigga, whats that, they just started riots?
So, we back on the street again
Me Travis [??] J-O-H-N
And everybody got a clique
But ain't nothing like hanging with the niggas that you close with
But then you got the fucking loners

I don't like Highschool, I'm just playing I love Highschool
Projects, dates, kickin' it with my classmates (I love highschool)
Women in hotels, blowing sweets to the new Drake mixtape (I love Highschool)
Sip my liquor and just smoke all of my drugs
(Every night and every weekend there is a party where go)

[Bridge]
I love summer
I love fighting
And I do it all over again

[Verse 2: Travis}
*Sound of an alarm clock and Travis waking up*
Good morning to everybody listening (Hey Travis!)
The chicks is in, if I'm Michigan
So time to get the bottles
It's sweet like
The women gon' bobble it up
And we make offers to their daughters for beerpong games
And they gobble it up
The fashion
Back on black with the emo kids
Rap and dreamers, now put your dreams up to this
