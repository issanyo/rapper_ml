[Chorus]
...
Feel like what my bitch look like, I'm fine
I just wanna have the time of my life (straight up)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
I don't really (yah)
I don't really care if a nigga don't like me (yah, yah)
Other than a wife, I got everything I need (everything I need)
A house in the hills I'm finna go buy me
