Leggo

[Hook: Shad Da God & T.I]
Yeah, you know I'm ridin' with that 6 (hol' up!)
Come through in that Benz playin' big (I say hol' up!)
And we blow that gas, you can smell her (turn it)
Ain't shit chu could motherfuckin' tell us (turn it)
Man I heard a fake one talkin' slick bout the kid (hol' up!)
Tell the hoe we playin' with the paper like a kid
Bankroll they neck, that's the shit they just throat
Hit the green lights, everybody on go (and you know it man)
Yeah, that's the motherfuckin' kid, bitch
You know I got my city, bitch
I say, you could get your wig split

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Go on and let me dim the white light, burn the white candles
Get a white girl out her white dress, down to white sandals (ya dig?)
The only stars in astrology that's making profits
Prophets on a rocket, like my city, we don't need the comet
And all that blasé, blasé, all that nonce, nonce
My girl look like a Nicki Rihanna Minaj Grande Yonce
That ego on a pedistal, you need better dude
I told her that APC not ABC, public school not 1, 2, 3
Still pushing packs, pushing packs on some mule shit
I'm over night your limbs relax on some cool shit
When the sun go down we jump around, we off the shits
Don't underdig the kids, ya digg?
