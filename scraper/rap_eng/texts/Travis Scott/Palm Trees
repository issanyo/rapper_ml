[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Where I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Yeah

[Verse 1: P. Reign]
I am that alpha omega
I hit that hoe, I don’t date her
I fuckin' don’t call her later
Won’t answer my phone, I will later
I am the latest, I’m rich and I’m signed to the majors
I’m cooking like I got it catered, you can not play us
Stunt in the town where they made us
And you won’t see nothing but lasers
Gilly got the burner, shot my bro bro
I’m the don, shout to polo
Fat ass, small waist, shout to lipo
And you know her brain crazy, she a psycho
I’m laid up, making love to the women they love
I’m grinding, my motto way up
That’s word to young Travis, straight up

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up

[Verse 2: Travis $cott]
When I lay up, need three of them when I lay up
Juggle my balls in a lay up
Way back in the back I’ve been laid up
Flights been direct not a layover
Lately I’ve been wanting to take a stewardess in the back
Bang, pow her, onomatopoeia
That double cheesey got ate up
Niggas counting and the day up
Did two months in the dirt, six double takers
Had to put work, double work for the pay up
(Straight up, La Flame)
That was easy now we laid up
Won’t stop until we get Ghost
They got a star, for err' night that we stayed up

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

[Verse 3: P Reign]
I got one hand on the title
I got one hand on a rifle
They yelling I'm next and I just got a check
So many O's it look like a typo
I pull up in the ghost all white though
That bitch turning pale, shouts to Michael
If she ain't about it, get the fuck from 'round me
I tell that bitch beat it like Michael

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up,  lay up
Lay up, lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up

[Outro: Travi$ Scott]
Laid up
Straight up
Laid up
Straight up
