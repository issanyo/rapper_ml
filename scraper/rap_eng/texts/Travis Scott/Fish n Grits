[Intro: Wale]
That post "Rodeo" flow, you know
Folarin the genius, Scott the genius
Mm, look, yeah

[Verse 1: Wale & Travis Scott]
Cartier, what your wrist doin'?
In the Ace with my nigga whip
Real nigga in that Will&Rich
I ain't stoppin' 'til a nigga fifty mil'
I ain't trippin' 'til a nigga hundred mil'
I ain't trippin' 'til I'm five hundred mil'
Funny, weighin' on the money
But I'm buyin' ice to let all of these niggas chill
Never ever gotta write a will
Niggas won't beat me like Emmett Till
Niggas won't bite me like Holyfield
Might run it back on you, I'm in the field
Hey, that money be comin' in, look
Money be comin' in, look
I just left the "Rodeo"
Then she ridin' my jawn again
She ridin' my jawn again, got up on again
And bone her, bone her, bone her, bone her
You know I'm a stoner, stoner, stoner, stoner
You know I'm a loner, loner, loner, loner
Smokin' that dope, only Cali could grow it
Doin' my shows, all the bitches gon' bump us
Show off my card, there's livin' with no limit
I could buy a house and a Benz in the mornin'
This is important

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Never seen a night like this
Won't you take a drag, another hit?
Whippin' up a pot, fish grits
Never seen a night like this, yeah
Never seen a night like this
Won't you take a drag, another hit?
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits
Never had a night like this

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Never seen nothin' like this
Yeah, don't make me hit the button, hit the nitrous
Yeah, bang her right soon as the light hit (skrrt)
Yeah, I tend to see the moon soon as the day flip
Yeah, auto-auto-automatic
Swerving, switching through traffic
Every time I call your phone (brrr)
I'm picking up, hearing static
Lobby looking like Magic (woo)
Living room on Stadium (woo)

[Verse 3: Wale]
She ain't too far from the DMV
From the DMV, I am the greatest one
I'm not a killer, boy, don't make me one
I'ma chill, I got a baby comin'
My partner said it's gon' be tougher for you
You ain't sucker pussy or fake as them
Real G nigga (yeah) elementary, nigga (woah)
Doja rolled in a Swisher (yeah) Bun B, Pimp C, nigga
Bun B, Pimp C, nigga; Bun B, Pimp C, nigga
Had to change the line a nigga wrote
Because America just hate to sees niggas winning

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Never seen a night like this
Won't you take a drag, another hit?
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits
Never seen a night like this, yeah
Never seen a night like this
Won't you take a drag, another hit?
Whippin' up the pot, fish grits
Never had a night like this
