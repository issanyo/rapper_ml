[Hook: Travis Scott]
White girl, for the white girl, they get all excited
Got enough in here to get us all indicted
Call up your girls, yeah they all invited
All I really need is your undivided
Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided
Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided

[Verse 1: Belly]
45 minutes just to wash it off your skin
You ain't even throw the pussy, what the fuck you offerin'?
It could be a thousand bitches, I'ma tell 'em all, "Come in"
When all I really need is you, you
You, she don't chase liquor and won't chase niggas neither
You, she don't take pictures, can't take bitches neither
Me on that 401, 500 cash in the trunk like I'm on the run
I signed to Black 'fore they won
S'posed to be 50, the plug said there's more to come
But you kept it one on one
Promise whenever we ball it's a one on one
You are a one of one
Pick up the pieces whenever I come undone
Whenever I fall like the summer done, faded 'til I fall over
Even when my heart cold like fall over, you still fall over
And over again, and over, and over again
And over again, even though I'm gone with the wind
You'll probably say I'm wrong, I'm a dog to the end
I'm a dog to the end, I'm a dog to the end
And I ain't make the song to offend
So it's okay to sing along with your friends

White girl, for the white girl, they get all excited

Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided
Undivided, undivided
All I really need is your undivided

[Verse 2: Belly]
She been around the world, never paid a flight
Told her stay tonight, I won't change your life
I just blame the life, blame these faded nights
She said, "Yeah, alright, that don't make it right"
But that don't make it wrong
Wanna talk about love? I'll play along
It's Dablo ho, don't you say it wrong
You got that shit I've been waitin' on
And I'ma fuck you in my own pace
Get some head now, pussy later on
Head now, pussy later on
Get a little head now, pussy later on
Bunch of white girls 'bout to start fuckin'
Penthouse lookin' like a Starbucks
