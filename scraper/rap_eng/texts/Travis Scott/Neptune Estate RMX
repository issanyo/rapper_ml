[Intro]
(King Krule)
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can lay inside

Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Overnight just over night, I slipped into a cardiac
Slipped out my conscious don't know if I'm coming back, young maniac
Might go burn a roof, or what I'm supposed to do
Your rolling loner, walking living proof
A victim of the youth
Can I last one more hour?
Can you last one more night, cause I can make it
I ain't crazy, ain't need no doctor, I need patience
They be like "boy there, where yah been?"
I been and made it, swear I been ablazing, swear I been amazing
Godly feeling, bad bitches, silicone-a-feeling
Let me cop a feeling, dream fulfilling
Tryna remix a million and build a building, gah damn!
I need that Neptune Estate that's out in the Hamps!
You know last night was so crazy, that shit went HAM!
Me and Archie, 10 bitches in a 2 seater
He can't remember nigga, and me either
Ahh!

I can lay inside
I can lay inside
Can't you bare just one more night?
I can lay inside
I can lay inside
I can stay in your mind
Wish me to stay away
But no sign tells me to stay, when others say
Dear brother
Can you tell that this faith is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Can you tell that this face is changed?
This heart, brain, pain, two separate ways
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tell me to stay, when others say
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
Wish me to stray away
But leave me no sign, tells me to stay
I could stay in your mind
I could stay in your mind
