[Chorus: Travis Scott and James Fauntleroy]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Riding in my old school thang
Shotgun with my old school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time, the skies are grey, ooh

[Verse 1]
Around this time, was starving, no Ramadan
Yeah, mighta robbed you blind
You, you, you, your dad and moms
Yeah, keep that in mind
Fear two things: being broke and dying
Yeah, jump your ass inside, LSD come take this ride
No A-C-I-D, how you get your ass inside
Yeah, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind
Yeah, fuck that college shit, that scholarship, let's hypnotize
Yeah, ooh

[Chorus]
We wake up when the sun goes down
Neighbor says the smell's too loud
Riding in my old school thang
Shotgun with my old school babe
So wake me when the sun goes down
Tonight's my last night in town
I pledge to a flag so grey
No matter what time, the skies are grey

[Bridge]
Grey! Yeah-yeah-oh
Grey! Yeah-yeah
Grey! Yeah-yeah-oh (uhuh)
Grey! The sky is grey
Grey! Mmm-mm-mm
Grey! Mmm-mm-mm
Grey! The sky is grey (uhuh)
Woah-ooh-oh
Grey! Yeah, yeah
Grey! Woah-ooh-oh
Grey! Yeah, yeah (uhuh)
The sky is grey, yuh
Yeah, the sky is grey, mmm-oh
Grey!

[Verse 2]
Might be the last time I trip
I know I said this shit last time
But damn I never had a trip like this
Who knew a threeway on freeway can trip with three hoes to a six-way?
Ain't gotta finesse out the midway
So Bird can wrap birds in that bengay
No more, goddamn
And pops never gave me shit
But pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside like it ain't that serious
My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit
Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick
Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious
Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul

[Outro]
The sky is grey
