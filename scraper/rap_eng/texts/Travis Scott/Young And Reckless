[Chorus]

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless
But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless, yeah...

[VERSE 1]

A boy asleep in the darkest light
A girl awakes to another guy
But he knows, the hole inside it's all her
He's reaching out, but she cannot hear
Through all the stars that are falling near
He wants the noise to disappear, yeah yeah

[Chorus]

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless
But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless

[VERSE 2]

She doesn't stay, but she has to leave
To run away is the hardest thing
He knows for now she's best alone
She finds the beauty in the pain
He wants to help but it's only [?]
It's so hard to see those broken wings, yeah, oh

[Chorus]

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless
But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless, yeah, yeah, oh

[BRIDGE]

Baby baby, it's so hard
Baby baby, it's so hard

[Chorus]

You got that burning in your eyes
Always a creature of the night
Just like a bullet into life, young and reckless
But I am the one who knows the truth
When all the lights go down on you
You're finding it hard to make it through
Young and reckless
