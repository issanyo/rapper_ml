[Intro]
Yo, uh
Got my nigga Easy in this motherfucker
Deadstock sixes and shit
Got my nigga Metro in this motherfucker, yeah, ooo

[Verse 1]
Uh, by the bar, buy the bar bitches on my table everywhere
On the floor, condoms on my dresser (straight up)
On my business, never plannin'
Never sober (La Flame) thinkin' blew me up
Body shots took on your bitches titties
Slow it down, pick it up, fuck a third
Speed the fourth gear grindin' up on everything it's my year (straight up)
I got it now, everything I ever asked for
We gettin' it, far from mama's jeep she never tinted it
She frozed up, I unfrozed her, now come a little closer (straight up)
Get your ass up off that wall and go roll up that doja (that dough)
Tell your boyfriend bust that key, go 'head and fill ya nose up (La Flame)
Till it's over, we ain't lookin' for the hoes where the trophies
Grab a glass go ahead get throwed up (straight up)
She feelin' it, don't spill the shit
Ahh, she crazy, she goin', she goin'
Gone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, all this money on the table, oooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather (straight up)
Damn, I'm with my main bitch
Ayy, and I don't love her no mo' (no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather (straight up)
Ayy

[Verse 2]
I'm off a bean, I'm off a bean
See this lean, it's in my dreams (that dough)
Off this dope, don't wanna smoke (oh no)
Off this roll, I might just roll (straight up, straight up)
Let's get throwed
Out in Houston they know my name (oooh)
In MO city they know the gang (oooh)
Young La Flame ain't nothin' changed
But the chains and diamond rings
Diamond rings, I lost my brains
Me and Ye Ye, out in broad day
I'm on the 3rd coast
Eatin' Burlow with Merlot (straight up)
I got my shirt off
Kickin' dirt off
Out in Bergdorf (La Flame)
She like what you doin'?
It took a path just to get me here
Don't give a damn if that's ruined
Later on got a "ring, ring, ring"
She at my doorbell "ding, ding, ding, ding"
Let the bitch in the bitch seen bang out bang out
On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth
Camera's out
Once my dick's in, no pulling out

[Bridge]
That's my baby (straight up)
Bitch been doing coke since the 80's (that dough)
I'm a 90's baby (La Flame)
Young La Flame, you know he crazy

[Chorus]
Ayy, (straight up, straight up) all this money on the table, oooh
We don't want relations
We don't want no conversations
Fuck around and change the weather
Damn I'm with my main bitch
Ayy and I don't love her no mo'
Drinkin', fuck the limitations
I done made it out the basement
Fuck around and change the weather
Ayy
