[Intro: Travis Scott]
2AM howlin' outside
Lookin' but I cannot find
Don't you fall asleep this time
I been on a long way drive
Only you can stand my mind
Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

[Verse 1: Kacy Hill]
With you here I'm home but
He won't last too long
Hardest love is when you're gone
With you here, I'm home, but
He won't last too long
Hardest love is when you're gone

[Verse 2: Kacy Hill]
Tell me everything's in you, baby
All you look at me with never phase me
Keep running back to the last time
Your hazy welcoming eyes were my safety
Tell me everything that you gave me
Just [?], take you away from
Running back to the last of our days
When I look in your eyes never phase me
