[Intro: Philly Swain]
She love me, she love me (she love me, she love me)
You say that you love me
And if you really love me, than go get my money
(she love me!)
'Less you heard me, you don't know truth
Rappers played out like phoneboothes
You couldn't fill my old shoes
Vexed cause you flexin' with my ex but she old news

[Bridge: Philly Swain]
Girl what you really on
Let me know if you fucking with the Philly don
Flexing hard, ain't the one to act silly, huh?
Mami ride me like a bench, get your willy on
Say what? girl what you really on
Let me know if you fucking with the Philly don
Flexing hard, ain't the one to act silly, huh?
Mami ride me like a bench, get your willy on
Say word

[Verse 1: Philly Swain]
Money, my money, she all 'bout my money
Soon as I get it, she beggin' it from me
Beg me, she beg me the way that she fuck me
Get it on Sunday, spend it by-hold up
Money don't grow on trees
When your ratchet ass ask say please
How come every time you want me I sneeze
Think you last man might have had fleas-hold up
I [?] the plans, well love is contagious
I give 'em the dick, they start acting outrageous
Then after mention the crib that I stay in
It's comfy and so is the bed that I-hold up
Like the offseason girl, I am not playin'
My chick independent so I am not payin'
She undressed and ask me where am I staying?
You smell like a marlin, I am not a Wayan

[Hook: Philly Swain]
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
You say that you love me, than go get my money
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
That's why she go hard whenever she fuck me

[Hook: Philly Swain]
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
You say that you love me, than go get my money
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
That's why she go hard whenever she fuck me

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
She love me, she love me
Damn how could she not, yeah
Menage on the dot, yeah
I feed her the knots, yeah
I feed her them rocks, (La Flame, straight up)
Hold up it's a marathon
Where the fuck my medicine
We the only ones that's trill ain't we?
We the only thing they feel ain't it?
Yeah, now it's on
Hardwood floors, marble doors, high [?], carnivals
Mobbin' space, in a race, we animals, in Hollywood
We way too gone (straight up)
She love me, she love me
You think that she don't?
Might wife that lil baby
Don't think that I won't

[Bridge 2: Philly Swain]
Ay tell her girl I ain't your last man
Throw that shitty attitude in the trash can
Girl I ain't in the mood for your shitty attitude
Girl got too much mouth, Mrs. Pacman, ooh
Got too much mouth, Mrs. Pacman
Girl you got too much mouth, Mrs. Pacman
Told her I ain't in the mood for your shitty attitude
Girl you have too much mouth, Mrs. Pacman, ooh

[Hook: Philly Swain]
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
You say that you love me, than go get my money
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
That's why she go hard whenever she fuck me

[Hook: Philly Swain]
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
You say that you love me, than go get my money
She love me, she love me, hey
She love me, she love me
That's why she go hard whenever she fuck me
