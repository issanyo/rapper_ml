[Verse 1: Jason Eric (& Travi$ Scott]
Roll it up,  spark it up, put that drink up in my cup
All my cars got leather and wood
In my hood we call it (diamonds)
Everybody wanna ball, give em' a couple shots
Watch em' stand and watch em' fall
I don't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rapping daily I'd still be driving Mercedes
Hummers at my nigga's crib
And we still rolling up that ganja
With a couple of Hondas
But that be the chicks behind us
Waiting when they wait-waiting for-for me too

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott]
Wow, those are amazing
Diamonds!

(Travi$ & Jason music)
[Hook: Travi$ Scott]

Nine to fivin'; drinking and driving
Cause' I'm high, so, so high

[Bridge 2: Travi$ Scott]
Mrs. Long, see I been getting along with...
Blowin up my on my bong so I been chiefing alone
Chilling with my homies, hitting up tinderoni
There's doobies and jacuzzi's, while's she's giving me dome

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Buzz cut, uncut, she keep cutting up
And my niggas copped the eighth it is you be dumb enough (Wow!)

[Interlude: Travi$ Scott and Uncredited woman]

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
I'm up in the morning

Cause' I'm high, so, so high
Nine to fivin'; drinking and driving
Cause' I'm high, so, so high

[Travi$ Scott]
