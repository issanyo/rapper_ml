Cool motherfucker everybody wanna get to know.

Making it rob, pop 'till you don't stop
Keep the cam rolling, the wind you see taking shots be the last float, cause I'm floating

Got a couple diamonds, what are you holding?
Reach for the pas, everything sweet burning
Damn, you slow keep turning

Everything looking bright
