[Intro: Theophilus London]
Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Wake up, bake up, hit the [?] all I see is them [?]
Cop lights, no lights, cause them bills it was overdue
Skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking walks to the side of the moon
Gotta take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, don’t wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I’m on some popular shit, come look in my eyes to get a fix
We just gon' cruise, hit the brews, don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy cause all the freaky models wanna party
Got the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can’t be realer, me and my niggas by the villa
She in that white dress it can’t fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink it like she got no liver
I hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
They peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn’t working out
Kiss my momma for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can’t wait
In the moonlight you can’t see my eyes
And when I’m off the things I can’t think
Damn I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can’t choke
When they recognize a real nigga skill
Ride with me, down with me, kept me afloat
Now all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let’s get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
