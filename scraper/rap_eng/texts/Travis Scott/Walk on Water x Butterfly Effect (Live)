[Intro: Thirty Seconds to Mars]
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1: Jared Leto]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Bloodlust in a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2: Jared Leto]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
For this life, I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M's, sweet like candy cane, yeah
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang, yeah
Yeah, for this life, I cannot change, yeah
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main, yeah
M&M's, sweet like candy cane, yeah
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang, yeah

[Bridge: Thirty Seconds to Mars]
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

[Chorus: Jared Leto]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe? Walk on water)
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
(Do you believe? Walk on water)
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

[Outro: Thirty Seconds to Mars]
Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water
