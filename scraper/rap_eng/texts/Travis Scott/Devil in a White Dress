Stupid bitch, these are Norcos
Now we up in my condo, we shooting a porno

You look right, right now

You upset right now
Spend this check right now

I'm glad her dress was white because I came on it (sorry)
I ain't give her no tattoo or nun' but I put my name on it (yeah)

I'm toned back, she sucked my dick so good to the point they ain't want it (woo)
I came on your wife dress but it was a white dress
Why would you wife that (why)
Devil in a white dress
Was it that bomb top (was it)
Was it that good cooch (was it)
