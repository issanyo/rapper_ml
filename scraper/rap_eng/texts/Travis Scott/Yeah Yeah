Snake shit, shoot your chest and shoot your bladder too
Ape shit, we go monkey, go banana too
Difference between me and him is he gon' run from you
And I'm nev' gonna run, I'ma gun at you

Cause my wife is too bad, she the bomb on you
Baby, suck that dick until it cum on you
I'ma suck that pussy, put some nut on you
She gon' drawdown with me, got you runnin' too
And just for that, I might put a son in you
Put a thirty piece right in my bomber too
Quarter milli', she know that she stuntin' too
