We gon' fuck this bitch up
We gon' tear this shit down
(I'm rollin' weed straight off this bitch, nigga)
We gon' fuck this bitch up
We gon' tear this shit down
(Fuckin' 'round with that ether)
We gon' fuck this bitch up
We gon' tear this shit down
(A hundred shots to the head, nigga)
We gon' fuck this bitch up
We gon' tear this shit down
(I wouldn't fuck with that, nigga)

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
AHHHHHHHHHH
But you don't hear me though
Skinny young nigga in the cameo
Doin' beer runs at the liquor store
AHHHHHHHHHH
Let me in this bitch
Hit the back door, I'm feelin' it
Fresher than a motherfucker, killin' it
Have a little taste of the Black Ace
Lean with the Sprite, turn a little grape
When I'm on the screen with the double O theme
Live a dream with this beam, momma did a scene
Better duck, better duck when a nigga buck
Shooters at your house, 'bout to light it up
Haven't seen the last niggas in about a month
Kickin' down your door, don't give a fuck
Bounce in this bitch, bounce like you've been to the N.O
Hookah flavors got these niggas turned into bitches, lil' hoes
And the hood niggas are them to watch
Run up the block, grabbin' that heat from the rocks
And your party like boom!, don't care what your party like boom!
And then we gon' burn the roof

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
I said fuck it, I went in nigga, and I lost it
I said fuck it, I went in nigga, and I bought it
Security let me through before I act a fool, pussy
Security let me through before I act a fool
Don't pat me down, nigga, I might Pacquiao a nigga
I say don't even laugh when I'm passin' y'all niggas
I say pull out the strap, and blast for y'all niggas
I say pull out the strap, and blast for your face
I'm a flashy young nigga, I be flexin' on niggas
I say your bitch, she showed me them titties
Her nigga in the crowd, he say he donâ€™t like us
I say aww shit, that nigga 'bout to fight
