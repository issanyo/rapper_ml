[Intro: Big Sean]
Yeah (we secure the enemy!)
Yeah, look
(If they do not surrender, shoot 'em on sight! Shoot on sight)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Talking to my momma half the time (yeah)
Talking to my daddy half the time
Streets crazy, they don't salvage time
Look at the news, that's savage time (woah)
Rolex, that's savage time (Ro)
Pass the licks, I ain't passing time (no)
Cutthroat, we on savage time (cut)
Cutthroat, we on savage time

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I'm taking out anyone in my way (way)
I'm not playing with you, bitch, this not the WNBA (no)
I'm a real-life star so you know I need my space (you know)
Beat a white supremacist black, 'til that motherfucker hate his face (lil' bitch)
I been going through some issues that nobody dealing with
Surrounded by real killers and shit, doing it for the thrill of it
Graveyards on some "Thriller" shit; only zombies 'round here fiends
They need help and they had dreams, but don't nobody give a shit
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga
Yeah, just like them boys in cells who had dreams of NFL (yeah)
How they s'posed to pray to God if they keep waking up in hell?
Been there so long, they got pictures with the fucking devil himself
Everybody need direction, even if it's to find they self
Look, I'm the greatest of our time, bitch, I do it till I die
Swear I'm done with all the bullshit like I moved up out the Chi' (like that)
All that fuck shit obsolete, boy, I hop up on my feet (my feet)
I'm the only one stopping me, I give you one finger away for peace (fuck it)
I'ma take that water from Flint, and I'ma go up there to D.C
I'ma make the president drink, he wouldn't even let it touch his sink
I said, "God, we need a blessing," God said, "Go and see the reverend."
People lined outside the churches like it's the white and blue 11's (straight up)
Hurricanes hitting with another bomb threat
Man, this shit feel like Armageddon, swear I'm goin' every second
So I keep good weed, good vibes, good crystals (yeah) lavender eucalyptus
Mixing it with the incense, just to relieve my tension
Savage time, yeah, it's time to take this shit (take it)
I mean record-breaking shit, all we doing is taking risks (that's all)
I ain't got time to take my time, I'm doin' it like my life on the line
I ain't have no lifeline in my whole lifetime, no hero to hide behind (behind)
With a soul like mine, when it go night time
There's no other choice but to shine (but to shine)
Look, no gold mines, set goals in my mind
When the stars are aligned, I'm divine (straight, straight)
So understand we gon' see success, that's inevitable (woah)
You couldn't hold me down even if I was in federal (woah)
You couldn't stop these plays even if I was ineligible
Kneeling like Colin Kaepernick if that shit unethical (Kap)
Yeah, free my mind, no bargain (free) got one girl, she the hardest (I swear)
That pussy supercharging, making love between war and
Then I hit the stage then get to talking like I'm Marcus Garvey (like I'm Marcus)
Like how is dark skin a weapon but they treat it like a target?
Like how if you rich in the mind then you already worth a fortune
Like you deserve every single golden por— [gunshots]

[Interlude]
Shots fired, I need 'em right now!
I need 'em, man down right now!
Shots fired, I repeat backup request!
Front line, front line, front line!

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I am at a point where
I just don't have any more to give, or feel
How the fuck I'm supposed to feel?
Shit's way too real in the field
Tell me how the fuck I'm 'posed to feel now?
Shit real out here in the field
Got me on no chill
These bitches got me on no chill

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Young nigga heaven sent
Raising hell 'til it's heaven again
My niggas used to sell dope, they was Backstreet Boys
Cops land 'em on the pavement now they black street boys
Pinstripe suits, how I'm mobbing
Alley-oop opportunities, yeah I lob it
To all of my niggas cause we got no other option
I pray V-12 is the only time I'm boxed in
Fuck a fake hoe, that bitch toxic
Push her off of me like I'm in moshpits
Every day fresh as fuck, you niggas never fly, you an ostrich
Back room of the restaurant, we the mobsters
Bitch I'll never touch a mop in my life
I'll never have a nine-to-five in my life
I'm riding through the D with all my jewelries
So much love for me, I never get robbed in my life
Aretha Franklin, respect it, respect
So in tune, I forgot how to stress
So in tune like the choir that's blessed
Boy, no stunt double, I'd die by the set, yeah
Got signed up like a nigga protest
If I ain't a pro at it then a nigga pro effect
Been doing this forever, I ain't getting old yet
Bitch I'ma fill this up with Möet
And my girl get mo' wet, only thing I cuff is Rolex
My nigga working with them bows, that's Bowflex
I straighten this shit out, no botox, I call the shots, no techs
Rocking enough chains for four necks, bitch

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Freedom bells, freedom ring (yeah)
Free the eyes, let 'em see
Free them birds (yeah)
Free them birds (yeah, straight up)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
