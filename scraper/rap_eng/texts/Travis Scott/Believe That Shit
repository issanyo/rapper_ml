[Intro]
Bitch, Mudboy
January 8th (8th)
They tryna kick me out this bitch
I've been the best in this room since Ye (huh)
Believe this shit (bitch)

[Chorus]
I was born to fuckin' be great (facts, bitch)
A lot of motherfuckers ain't built for this shit (nah)
If it mean I gotta stay up late, I'ma do it, huh (up late)
Nobody going to sleep up in this fucking bitch (facts)
If shootin' shots gon' take me to the NBA, huh (swoosh)
I'm shootin' these shots until my arms get stiff (yeah)

[Verse 1]
You know this young nigga tryna get paid (tryna get paid, bitch)
I'm gettin' this chicken, need to get really rich (really rich)
Ain't got no fuckin' name (no name, no bitch)
Call me Sheck Jesus, bitch, I'm changin' my shit (bitch)
'Cause I only came to fuckin' say, huh (I came)
Savior, bitch, I'm savin' this shit (yeah)
Blood sucker, I'm a bad motherfucker (boy, mudboy)
Coming through, uh, with the plaid on, like a trucker, uh
Big guns, nigga (bitch, bitch), bust 'em, bust 'em, uh (bitch)
Bad bitch, ass bust up, bust up, uh (mudboy)
Hit from the back, I gotta bust up, bust up (beat it from the back)
She gon' bust a nut, uh
Young Sheck Wes (bitch), exclusive motherfucker (fucker)
Out here goin' off (off), I'm a bad motherfucker
I am goin' off (let's go), like a missile plan
I'm goin' off (God), bottle drinkin' (uh)
That's my fuckin' brother, uh, I fuckin' love him, uh

[Bridge]
Damn, TMZ, how you do me like that?
You used to stand up on stage in a cowboy hat (damn)
Damn, TMZ, how you do me like that?
You used to stand up on stage in a cowboy hat (bitch)
Cowboy hat
19 years but we stay in the trap, like
You used to stand, Tee
You used to stand up on stage in a cowboy hat (19 years old, bro, how you do that?)

[Verse 2]
I can't ever switch up, sir
I can't only switch lanes (skrt)
Young nigga gotta stay too real
Too many people too fuckin' fake
Too many people two fuckin' faced
Too many people just goin' through a phase
I ain't got no fuckin' name
Call Sheck Jesus, if you want to get saved
Call Obama, you wanna get changed
I only got a .44, I ain't from '08
I was born in fucking '98
I think that's why I signed, 'cause I don't fuckin' play

[Interlude]
Bitch, bitch
Thank you, I don't have to do (uh)
But get the fuck out of here
Fuck is you talkin' about, bitch (yeah)

[Chorus]
I was born to fuckin' be great (facts, bitch)
A lot of motherfuckers ain't built for this shit (nah)
If it mean I gotta stay up late, I'ma do it, huh (up late)
Nobody going to sleep up in this fucking bitch (facts)
If shootin' shots gon' take me to the NBA, huh (swoosh)
I'm shootin' these shots until my arms get stiff (yeah)
If shootin' shots gon' take me to the NBA, huh (swoosh)
I'm shootin' these shots until my arms get stiff (yeah)
If shootin' shots gon' take me to the NBA, huh (swoosh)
I'm shootin' these shots until my arms get stiff (yeah)
