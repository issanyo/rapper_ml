[Verse 1]
We waited so long for this, to transform like I'm optimus
Monogamy for monogamous, ironically don't have time for this
The education brought scholarships
All the street taught us was to be streetwalkers
Full of hype and the life of a cheap talker
So tonight don't have no excuse not to take these offer
Now its time to make these suffer
Break out the bread and the wine and make E supper
Feel like a Pharaoh in his prime call that de-mumma
Momma, please don't trip on these trees at least none of these fuck ya
In the mindset of the greatest
Put that I'm a young Houston legend in the making
Grab your cameras Ima photo to be taking
Let the lights down tell them pipe down

[Chorus]
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off

[Verse 2]
All black blending in the night
X pound triple X style so profound Alana Fife
Secretary poppin' molly call it X-files
Think I'm in a daze I'm just feeling Blazed
Think I'm in a shape but I'm behind a maze
Funny you was amazed when you was getting laid
Me and my niggas plotting now we getting paid
Giuseppe stilettos and Arabic Camaros
Everybody's fine no Robert De Niro
Why everybody do the line is my favorite hero
Guess I gotta find the time just to do the crime
She did a lot of crimes sleepy hallow time
Headhunter been up for hours doing head crunches
Stop using your head and go head and just learn something
But her head is only as strong as her bread damn it

[Chorus]
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off
ILLEamerica tell me you're coming home
I'm tired of telling ya that the world has lost its hope
So come on with me tonight, don't worry just cool off
So let's rule the world tonight don't worry will show off
