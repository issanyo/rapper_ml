I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We lost in the world who's feeling safe
It's parked outside been in the case
We walk outside feel like a mason
Another preacher at the altar to tell you to have a taste
White wine, go ahead and sip your race
And walk in the closet and feel amazed
Ain't no retire, fall out of line and we get to pace
And we gonna simply reside and fill up the space
Took the Travis may leave you around and place it
That's a classic, no other way to have it
Remember me and my brother slept on that mattress
Now look how many bitches piled up on that mattress
I'm feeling too proud, cause all my niggas aroused
I got them people right now for them to fill it
It was cool for a second, but now might take a minute
Cause now I'm in the building, god damn, I'm about to kill it

[Hook]
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Welcome to America, home to the gutter, nigga
Where every nigga wanna be another nigga
Either your brother or your cousin is the drug dealer
If you make it out the hood, haters wanna grudge with you
As I wander these streets up under me
It's a concrete jungle economy
Who runs the world? Ego, money, greed
Well, I have my weed and my money green
Who ever said that we wasn’t money trees?
Anyway fuck it, I’mma get high anyway
Gone before my niggas say
Lock up in them prison gates
Life’s a bitch then you die
If you can do you any day

[Hook]
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground

[Verse 3: T.I.]
3-57 apparo the shit I wearo be Balenciaga
Prada, Margiela or something hotter
Double barrel your medulla oblongata send you to Allah
A million dollars on my wardrobe, Damier on my collars
Nothing short of an assassin, garments I sit my ass in
Kill niggas dead on the scene, no casket
Basking in my glory on the 37th story of a highrise
Ten hoes, nice thighs, mai tai's
Serving umbrellas, but I knew the perfect fellow
So impressive, she would straddle this berretta if I let her
Have a blast of a lifetime, ass of a lifetime
Swear this dick I give her it'll last her a lifetime
A nice nine selling hard rock in the pipeline
Put in their life and now they love a nigga longtime
Wednesday three freaks, Thursday four hoes
Five on Friday, yesterday six chicks
Today is the sabbath I got seven going at it
On a mattress doing shit you can't imagine, I'm laughing
True story, real talk, that's classic

[Hook]
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating, I'm floating
From the ground
