[Verse 1]
Enter the game with a ill ass flow
For the love of my ancient ways of astral
Burnin' buds in the face of pain and back home
Mad gold on a nigga like a young pharaoh
Metaphor for that inner spirit
Got them saying oh lord when they finally get it
She remain on all fours when my nigga hit it
Said she never met a star, but the sky's the limit
Bitch nigga, U.A. ain't no stoppin' us
Homie level your chakras up
Find me rolling some tropic up
Bitches grabbing my crosses
Never paid her or dropped the cup
Busy getting my profit up
Change the world, elevate shit
And hurry before your clock is done
Til this case closed thought I wouldn't get dough
Now we sellin' out the show puttin' on for the coast
Big bank rolls wonder why they hate though
Keep a wife like ? when I spot them front row
I don't do dates, slide straight in the booth
Vacate like it's June, I escape too soon
Better cry a lake on a late afternoon
While I'm puffing high-grade
Elevate or we doomed
Indigos we mobbin', third optic solve every problem uh
Off that medication, pop your shit and then we wildin' uh
Super bright enlightened, my aura shinin' in every spot
Read between the lines
Raise your middlefinger, say fuck the law

[Hook] x4
Fuck em, say fuck the law
Fuck em, say fuck the law
Read between the lines
Raise your middlefinger, say fuck the law
