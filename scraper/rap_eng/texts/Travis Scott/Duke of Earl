[Intro: Gene Chandler]
As I-I walk through this world
Nothing can stop The Duke of Earl
And-a you, you are my girl
And no one can hurt you, oh no

[Verse 1: Jason Eric]
We reason for where it's cloudy
Faking out where it's sunny
Me and Trav in the Humvee
Looking like [??] puppies
Sitting comfy on a jet, just in the air above me
My bitches sending texts like hit me up in the morning
We reason for where it's cloudy
Faking out where it's sunny
Me and Trav in the Humvee
Looking like [??] puppies
Sitting comfy on a jet, just in the air above me
My bitches hit me up in the morning
I'm dropping of my homie
Tryna
Some weed that she can roll me
3 in the morning
Passing put, waking up to some girls
Phone buzzing
Not tryna be rude, just hitting buttons
Falling out of bed, trying to find me some shoes
The one is giving me head, the other one tryna chose

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And I wanna go far
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And a shiny new car
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And I wanna go far
She said I wasn't good enough
She said I wasn't good enough
She said I wasn't good enough

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
Miss independent, she move straight from the debut
Doctor said the children pilin' all up in the Prius
Ex nigga was a baller, but didn't sign that prenup
Poked holes all in his rubber, got pregnant off the pre-nut
Packing and began running before she see us
[??] like FEMA
But you know I'm never slacking, mayne
Tho, got dough, like you the, I'm steady macking
Fuck it, keep them buckets
Steady packing with them luggage
Couldn't afford to pay attention, so I earned some friends

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And I wanna go far
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And a shiny new car
She said I want a Duke of Earl
And I wanna go far
She said I wasn't good enough
She said I wasn't good enough
She said I wasn't good enough
