[Verse 1]
It's not Jay-Z and Beyoncé
It's not Nicki or Lil Wayne
It's not Oprah and Obama
The Pope and Rihanna
Queen Elizabeth or Kanye
It's not pentagrams or witchcraft
It's not triangles or stacks of cash
Black magic or Gaga
Gucci or Prada
Riding on the Golden Cat

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's the enlightenment that started it all
The Founding Fathers wrote it down on the wall
And now the media's misleading us all
Turned right into wrong
It's time to dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Verse 2]
Behind the curtain of the New World Order
It's not platinum encrypted corners
It's not ISIS or the Phoenix
Pyramids of Egypt
Don't make it into something sordid
It's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates
It's not the Google of United States
It's not Bieber or LeBron
Clinton or Obama
Or anyone you love to hate

[Pre-Chorus]
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
That's what it is, Truth and the Light
All-Seeing Eye is watching tonight
Nothing to hide, secret's inside

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Post-Chorus 2]
You know that everything that glitters ain't gold
So let the music take you out of control
It's time to feel it in your body and soul
C'mon, let's go
We're gonna dance and turn this dark into something
So let the fire burn, this music is bumping
We're gonna live forever, love never dies
It starts tonight

[Breakdown]
It's like
It's like
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like illuminati

[Chorus]
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati

[Outro]
Everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
It's like, everybody in this party, shining like Illuminati
