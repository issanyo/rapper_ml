Libra On The Beat

Verse 1
She know all the spots around pimlico
All the drugs her plug pablo
My plug not in the 410
He out in middle river
I call him keko
She a bad girl
But her head good
Got dreams
Like hollywood
Always up in them backwoods
Ain't no telling when she getting out the hood
Not to mention she in high school
Always around them drug dealers
And football players
Girl why you
Leave it to me
To get ya head right
All she wanna do is get high for life
Last time i did drugs wit her
Ex was off my mind right
Haven't seen her since october
She don't like me when I'm sober
Think we over
Girl I need you what i told her
She said baby if need me
Just come see me
All these trees is what I needed
Let me stimulate your mind

They screaming don't let out that antidote
I turned around and she all up on me
Now her mouth all on my throat
Me knowing she soaking wet
I’m trying backstroke to her lil room

Interlude
You the one you know me the best
She always broke it down when i’m stressed
Now a days my feelings feeling gone
Cause of you girl yeah you did me wrong
Little Ms. Perfect got mistreated
If she would've stayed with me she never would have to feel it
