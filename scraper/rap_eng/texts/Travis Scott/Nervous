[Verse 1: Wynter Gordon]
Come on, tell me what's the word
Silent lips I've never heard
Show me that you really like me
Come now
I'll give you a little time
Five minutes to blow my mind
That's all I need to

[Pre-Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Nervous, nervous
You know I'm the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps
So what's in it for me?

[Verse 2: Wynter Gordon]
Oh, submission doesn't hurt
If you whistle while you work
Tell me that you wanna please me
Right now
If you look me in the eye
Tell it all and don’t be shy
That’s all I need to

[Pre-Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Nervous, nervous
You know I'm the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps
So what's in it for me?

[Verse 3: Travi$ Scott]
Damn you make me so nervous
The type that might commit murder
I used to sneak inside your house, bring you sherbet
We used to fantasize a lot about
All of the nights in your white Lanta
She wore a weave and that bandana
Ain't leavin' 'til the sun is shine
Took you home, she ran like every light
For like three summers there and that was like every night
We used to party then we fuss and fight
Get at you naughty to make it right
But that was never right
(Yeah it was never right but now I'm gonna get it right)

[Pre-Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out
Figure you out

[Hook: Wynter Gordon]
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Do I make you nervous?
Nervous, nervous
You know I'm the bomb
I’m like candy on your arm
When I play I play for keeps
So what's in it for me?

[Outro: Wynter Gordon]
So if you call me
I just might be waiting by the phone
But don't ignore me
Girls like me won't be alone for long
Call me
Waiting by the phone
'Nore me
Be alone for long
