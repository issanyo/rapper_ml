[Intro: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Where I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Yeah

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up

[Verse 2: Travis $cott]
When I lay up, need three of them when I lay up
Juggle my balls in a lay up
Way back in the back I’ve been laid up
Flights been direct not a layover
Lately I’ve been wanting to take a stewardess in the back
Bang, pow her, onomatopoeia
That double cheesey got ate up
Niggas counting and the day up
Did two months in the dirt, six double takers
Had to put work, double work for the pay up
(Straight up, La Flame)
That was easy now we laid up
Won’t stop until we get Ghost
They got a star, for err' night that we stayed up

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up



[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
Yeah, come see where I lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
I lay up, I lay up
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up
Palm trees where I lay up
Come see where I lay up

[Outro: Travi$ Scott]
Laid up
Straight up
Laid up
Straight up
