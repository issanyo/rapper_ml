[Chorus]
Watch me, watch me get louder, get louder
Watch me (ooh), watch me, get louder, get louder
Watch me

[Verse]
Watch me start standin' on the couches
Watch me start fuckin' on they spouses
Yeah, watch me start runnin' up announcements
Watch me start goin' on ménages
Watch me start, and I'll be here
Watch me start goin' up in here
I been goin' hard for a year
Goin' separate ties in the-
Heartbroken, come ménage with me
Yeah, baby, it's a supersize, size 50

[Instrumental]
