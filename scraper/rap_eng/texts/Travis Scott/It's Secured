[Intro: Nas, Travis Scott & DJ Khaled]
I know, I said "Nas album done"
We the Best Music!
But we got one more to do first
Straight up!
DJ Khaled!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
150 stack it all in my Gucci jacket
50 more in the Goyard, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Got the mansion on the island
It's secured, it's secured
Got them bitches flyin' private
It's secured, it's secured
Foreign bitches and they wildin'
It's secured, it's secured
100 mil', keep on pilin'

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm principle driven, only real ones feel me
Most needed protection from the OG's to get bigger
No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound â€“ what your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not askin' questions
Seen the vests, seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck
I gave myself a good hand
Probably ran through a hundred million
Per decade, I'm not phased, and I could spot ya
A hundred million before you could ever spot grays
Chili Fritos in the helicopter
Money can't get that ghetto out'cha

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
150 stack it all in my Gucci jacket
50 more in the Goyard, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Got the mansion on the island
It's secured, it's secured
Got them bitches flyin' private
It's secured, it's secured
Foreign bitches and they wildin'
It's secured, it's secured
100 mil', keep on pilin'

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2: Nas]
Watch out for insecure niggas
They take your soul out your body, they not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
Resort to violent reactions
That's childish, my life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustles (Straight up!)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody holdin' shmoney in pics
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep!)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silently listen, use the same letters to spell it right
So hear me, from Nasty I'm mature
Here's another appetizer
Khaled, we did it again, let Travis take us higher!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
150 stack it all in my Gucci jacket
50 more in the Goyard, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah yah yah yah yah yah
It's secured, it's secured
Got the mansion on the island
It's secured, it's secured
Got them bitches flyin' private
It's secured, it's secured
Foreign bitches and they wildin'
It's secured, it's secured
100 mil', keep on pilin'

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott]
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
It's secured, it's secured
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
A hundred mil', keep on pilin'
It's Nasir and Travis and Khaled
That's right: Khaled Khaled
