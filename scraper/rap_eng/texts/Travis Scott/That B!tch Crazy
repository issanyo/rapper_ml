[Intro]
(Talking on the Phone)
She got a hold on me
Then she turnt around and go so cold on me
Almost frozed on me
Yeah I know
Na-na-na-now that bitch can't let me go

[Hook]
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy

[Verse 1]
I dozed off in this cabin
Damn, I woke up barely breathing
Damn, I can't believe what I'm seeing, bitch from last weekend
We all met up for drinks and
She standing same coat, still chiefing on that pinewood
I'm tryna' figure how I end up in these dry woods
About as high as I was, no clothes and I'm tied up
Look like life or death, and she staring me in eyes
So I had to wipe my eyes cause this shit ain't gone fly
So I had to go, broke out then I clocked out now it's time to roll
Should have know I shouldn't have boned but I had the dough
When I pulled out all the weed she pulled out the blow

[Hook]
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy

[Verse 2]
We took trips down to Marrows even shopped up at Meadows
She moved straight out the ghetto cause she deep down in that hell hole
Scholarships, daddy even let her drive all kind of whips
That's why I hear tire screeching
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
I feel like she right behind me
But that ass might be outside
See all this gold right behind me, now that shit ain't no mirage
And she crazy like she Fonzy cause I won't have no menage
When I see me on the concrete man I swear I almost died
Somehow I jumped straight out my car seat not even I parked that shit outside
That bitch had me running down a dark street
How I made it out alive I don't know I must be slonky
How I know, now now I know

[Hook + Bridge]
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
She met me at the, that bitch crazy, that bitch crazy
Yeah I know yeah yeah I know yeah yeah yeah that bitch crazy
The street lights, the street lights
She met me at the street lights, street lights
