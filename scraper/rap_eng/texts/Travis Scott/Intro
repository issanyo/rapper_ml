-Woah, woah, woah, who the fuck are 'The Classmates'?

-How the hell did y'all meet?
Well you see here: you know, we started of in Spanish class, Mrs. Reigh
You know, nothing, you know, too awkward, like I'm feeling right now

-So, what's the average day's life of The Classmates?
*Laughs like Wiz Khalifa*, the average day life of a Classmate is crazy
Like, we start off, go to school, break the rules, do stuntastic things, go to The Galleria, spend guap, you know what I'm saying?
Fuck hoes, or we call em boes, and you know what I'm saying, chill with the [?] family and get blown, Travis?
