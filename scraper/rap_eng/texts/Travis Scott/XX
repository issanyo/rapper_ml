I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)

[Verse 1]
Wake me up in the mornin'
Versace out with this gold on
We roll around in them ponies
205 in your hometown and you know this
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Big medallions, I keep it stylish, you ain't notice?
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Put you down on my Brodus
This that Paris flow,
100 digits, no area codes
Hangin' out in 'em white streets
All black where the hipsters go
Everybody here chokin'
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Serious rap, your serious rap's too focused
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Stressin' out while we coolin' out

[Chorus]
Big buds, Brussel sprouts
Big boobs, let 'em out
Chillin', homie, my chain heavy
Might as well let your dogs out (swag)
Rottweilers, Great Danes
Smart bitch, dumb brain (swag)
Flip the bird, hit the swerve
Somehow niggas done missed the curve (swag)

[Refrain]
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)

[Verse 2]
Boss shit, too fresh to go floss it
Too cold for Jack Frost, bitch
Throwin' up in that mosh pit
Tony got this bitch chokin'
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Fifty-two in that Hoover Benz so we locin'
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Suicide and they pokin'
This that dentist flow, organic Arsenio
Chillin' out in them white streets
All black where the hipsters go
Everybody here floatin'
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)
Serious Wapanese, all them Japanese holdin'
(I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I)

[Chorus]
Big buds, Brussel sprouts
Big boobs, let 'em out
Four chains, let 'em hang
Golden egg in my pinky ring
Might as well let them dogs out
Rottweilers, Great Danes
Smart bitch, dumb brain
Flip the bird, hit the swerve
Somehow niggas done missed the curve

[Refrain]
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)
I, double-L, A, M, E
I, double-L, A, M, E, R, I, C, A (swag)
