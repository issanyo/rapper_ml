[Intro sample: Michael Bublé]
And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out

[Hook: Travi$ Scott & Michael Bublé]
I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet
And I don't know what to do... And I don't know what to do... But I'm good, yeah I'm good, I'm good, yeah I'm good
And I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Yo, fuck, I'm tryin' to wake up in jacuzzi's
With your chick, and her friend and they both done the doobie
Jet ski's, and humvees while I'm sippin' on smoothies
Fuck these and suck these while I'm fillin' the booty
Fuck I'm tired of chasing the dream without my 'fam and all
I'm lacing these beats, and keeping it G, not giving a damn at all
Wrong homie to chill with, got some homies that real, bitch
On and off, she take Chanel on and off
Wrong homie to chill with, got some homies that real, bitch
On and off, I take the triples on and off

[Hook: Travi$ Scott & Michael Bublé]
I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet
And I don't know what to do... And I don't know what to do... But I'm good, yeah I'm good, I'm good, yeah I'm good
And I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 2: Jason Eric]
Ugh, I'm kicking the sneaks, hitting the sheets;
Another day is gone
I'm keeping the tweets
Killing these beats these niggas worship on
Hitting these freaks these niggas take weeks just to get upon
Hitting the blogs trying to get on until we get along
With a couple of chicks, a couple of tits that we can feel up on
A couple of fans, a couple of texts next then I'll be on?
A couple of nights, a couple of fights just to prove they wrong
The sooner we out, niggas don't [?] with the niggas they grew up on
And the niggas we grew up on, I hope you got your checks
And they just say you want cuz...

[Hook: Travi$ Scott & Michael Bublé]
I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet
And I don't know what to do... And I don't know what to do... But I'm good, yeah I'm good, I'm good, yeah I'm good
And I'm sitting at home, I'm all alone alone cause...I just haven't met you yet
