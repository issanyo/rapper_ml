[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Fly (fly, fly, fly, fly)
Let it fly (let it fly, let it fly, let it fly)
Let it fly like the birds in the sky
Hotter than the weather in July
I done did so much I can't decide
Word, word to my guys
She just get so wet, I slip and slide
Had to get it back to give 'em five
I, I, I, yeah

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
It's Mr. Michael Myers, man (Michael Myers)
Word to the MoneyBagg, I keep it coming in (whoo, whoo)
By the way we work you think I had a twin (twin)
I'm tryna run the game, it ain't no subbing in (naw)
You can't phase me, sliding from a dangerous life (it's lit!)
Always down to ball, I'm tryna drain these nights
See the smoke clouds through the entertainment lights
The way it go down we taking fours and keeping doors tight (Yeah, yeah!)
We at the top, end of discussion (discussion)
We mixing alcohol and that 'tussin
The demon in they eyes and they clutchin' (scared)
I feed 'em adderall and they bussin', yeah (pew, pew, pew)
I kept the towel, not throwing in
I'm riding around in my ends
I got a driver for the Bent' to drive me 'round when I'm bent
I keep some pussy just to lick, they help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah (brr-brr, brr-brr)
That's the phone call, when my blood ring
It's Tha Carter V, let the thugs sing (thugs)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Let it fly (brr, fly)
Let it fly like the birds in the sky (brr-brr)
Hotter than the weather in July (brr-brr)
I done did so much I can't decide (it's lit)
Word, word to my guys (yah)
She just get so wet, I slip and slide (splash)
Had to give it back to give them five
I, I, I

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived, it's C5
Been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised
And we advise you not fuck with me and mine
And keep in mind that we don't mind losing our minds
Free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, "Never mind"
What's on your mind?
Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mindfreak, no sober mind
I'm so behind, but front line
You crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you getting out of line, I hang you with a clothing line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lying, it's a thin line, I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip; more than one, I'm too-equipped
Talking 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Trying not to get pinched, smoking on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan (it's lit)
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Travis Scott]
C5, best rapper alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let it fly
