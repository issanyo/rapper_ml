[Intro]
It's lit

[Chorus]
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (it's lit)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they get so upset, yeah (straight up)
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (yeah)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they be so upset (yeah)

[Verse]
Thousand dollars on me, I've been going all week
Diamonds, all my drugs, nigga, I can't get no sleep
I just want some love, I've been going way too deep
Falling on my mouth, bank can't give me no more weight
Top play, aye they haters, young nigga tryna say shit
Big dog conversation, big ice revelation
Rolex rollin' on my piece, I been going fine all week
Yeah, I designed my feet
I fucked around and smashed your niece
Man, they hate, why they can't relate, yeah
Light skin niggas, they just stand and pay, hide away, yeah
I've been going ways
Up all my coats and going away
Every time, even family time, it take no place, yeah

[Chorus]
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (it's lit)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they get so upset, yeah (straight up)
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (yeah)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they be so upset, yeah (yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (it's lit)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they get so upset, yeah (straight up)
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet (yeah)
We got cash to get, carats hangin' from my neck (yeah)
Money, power, respect, quit the talkin', cut the check
Every time they see us flex, they be so upset, yeah (yeah)
