[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Late night, scrollin' through my call log
Had too much to drink, so I called ya
We been on an' off for a long time
How 'bout I come to your job an' just spend time?
Damn, God damn, you always do it, damn
We get it at demand, got me thumbin' through them bands
I thank your momma for you damn features
Yo' ass on Pam, I swear I ain't lying, Gina
Thought that we would never talk again
'Cause you always call me up at the wrong time

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & Travis Scott]
Everybody love you, baby
Can't nobody love me like you (ooh-ooh-oooh)
Everybody love you, baby (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)

[Post-Chorus: Travis Scott & James Fauntleroy]
Baby, love
Baby, baby
You're my love
You always call me up at the wrong time (baby)
I be up late, obeying no signs, no (know that I need 'ya baby)
Won't you come over an' just roll mine? (yeah, baby)
I'ma mix somethin' for the long drive home
Baby, love
Baby, baby
You're my love
Baby, love
Baby, baby
You're my love

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Wishin' I controlled time, wishin' I could do it
Wishin' for a long time just to set the mood
And we be goin' all night, but you just abusin'
Always had my phone line, but you never used it
Now you see me goin' up, now I'm glowin' up
I been, I been in that DB truck with my Courtney Love, ohh-oh

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy & Travis Scott]
Everybody love you, baby (everybody love you, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)
Everybody love you, baby (everybody love you, baby)
Can't nobody love me like you (like you)

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Baby, love
Baby, baby
You're my love
Baby, love
Baby, baby
You're my love
