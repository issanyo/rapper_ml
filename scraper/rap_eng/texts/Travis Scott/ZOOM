[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Gotta stay down, ya ain't got no zoom
Big rock, diamonds, Yao Ming yoom
Purple lemonade, puffin' out them fumes
Heatin' up like last day in June

[Verse: Gunna & Travis Scott]
Niggas stealin' my drip, that shit ain't cool
See Gunna gettin' tags, let me floss my jewels
I cherish her face, I pay for her groom
No time, no way so I'm takin' off soon
Cash out on drip, tryna fly to the moon'
Lookin' like "who is he?"
Gunna no runner, he move like me, yeah
Got foreigns, a moving fleet
To Travis like where is security?
I fly her right in then meet up at the room
She don't know your name but she know all my tunes
I pass it to Los, and he shot it to Junes
You can't try none the brothers, the brothers try you
If you try one of us you get put on the news
Pull up in that new Bentley truck
Bag full of money and all of these hunnids is blue
I know you proud of me, A.P., I don't do apologies
Talk [?] on my Prada tee, purchase on my new AMIRI jeans
Young Gunna drip god, I fly with no wings
I let her use my card to secure her needs
Had to tell her girl these pearls, not beads
Gettin' high in the sky without my weed
