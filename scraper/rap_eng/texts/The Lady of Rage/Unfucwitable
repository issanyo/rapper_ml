[Verse 1]
Who talking smack bitch, you wanna get at this
Think you need more practice
You way out your bracket
I rock the home of fucking Atlas
Save that racket for the tennis court, and I
Brought your mission
Resort to kissing these glutes
On your plate like flutes
Cause the agony that I inflict
Causes tragedy when I spit
And if you ain't the shit
You better dip, you better split
You better take off
Before I before break off, make off
Munch through cupcakes that's soft
That's why I serve you like a bake-off
I'll rip your Face Off like I'm Nicholas Cage
You wanna face off, that's ridiculous I'm Rage
The mic brawler, the night crawler
I smoke em like I'm off that water
Clara Adla's great-granddaughter
Would injure you, your girl from Virginia
Make no bones about it, when it's on I'm bout it
I gotta niceness that remains raw, my iceness never thaws
Priceless, baby hah Rage, that's all

[Hook]
Check the flow
Rage in effect
So now you know
Kick up dust as I begin to bust
Back on up

[Verse 2]
I'm folding emcees like Times with dirty consonants and vowels
When I'm creeping on the prowl and stay wild out like an owl
Now who who flows better than this rhyme writer
You in a clique full of dicks and you still couldn't come tighter than
Live in red dress, with the afro puff hairdress
Young and restless, naw you nah wanna test this
I break it down baby, you best pray to the Lord
Cause, uh fucking round with Rage is a what you can't afford
I leave em standing on they tippy toes
Dealing with a drippy nose
Bombarding with my fifty flows
I ain't fucking with these silly hoes
Now shit's about to get so retarded
I just got dumped and I got left broken hearted
I ain't got shit to lose, the first bitch that move
They gon' catch it in the worst way, Rage blood thirsty
Attacks ready to throw down, that's how it goes down
I can't slow down
Judge Joe Brown convicted me of rhyme slaughter
Cause I spit killable syllables
Leave em pitiful, the cynical Rage, unfuckwitable

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Now with my Timbos
I could leave a bimbo in limbo
Make em tremble
When I spit through the dental of these instrumentals
When I'm chewing on a mental, ?? wicked from the intro
I told y'all from the get-go
I rock harder than credentials
Save that shit for your colon
I strike em like I'm bowling
You sweet cheeks can't compete with the heat that I'm holding, ha
Dingbats, better take their wings back and cash in
Lyrical murderer back up in this bitch to bashing
So ante up and pull your panties up
And call your Granny up, tell her that you got your fanny bust
Weak shit banged off the backboard
How about some hardcore
How about some rough, rugged and raw
With all sincereness, I spit lyrics with raw severeness
Gladiator fearless, Tyson style - leave em earless
So which of you want me to snatch you by your britches, boo
I hit you with my witches' stew
Turn em into bitches' brew
Terror, when you up against Rage Hitchcock
From H block
With a flow that make em scream Rage stop
Now that's crazy
Naw, that's the Lady Of Rage

[Hook x2]
