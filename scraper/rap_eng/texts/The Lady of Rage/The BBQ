[Intro] [Rah Digga talking]:
This is what y'all been bloggin' 'bout right?
Uh-huh

[Hook]:
It's like that y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
That y'all (That y'all)
It's like that y'all (Like that y'all)
Like that y'all (That y'all)
Bitches and that's all

[Verse One] [Rah Digga]:
Fiya, mixtape warin'
Shoppin' on Fordham
I be movie scorin'
Rhymin' out of boredom
Somewhere in the islands tryin' to talk to sister Lauryn
Anything less than six figures I ignore them
Hit Ventura for shrimps imported
With pimps from Florida, friends from Europe
Fuck hip hop police
Got hip hop jurors
We some hip hop purists and it just got purer
See what the game came down to since Rah left
Chicks a hot mess, Fergie all we got left
Sad story
Even the awards don' dropped the category
These rap bitches corny
99 problems my ass
Got about 99 with 99 in the flask
Mercurial bitch in '99, 10 years passed
When I'm droppin' motherfuckers still ask

[Hook]

[Verse Two] [Eternia]:
Eternia, the goddess of this rap shit
And it's obvious we got this locked cause look how it lasted
Uphill climb since I was in the baby basket
Relevant to many who don't follow the masses
Laugh at you, cause I can do what you can do better than you
Smack a few rappers 'til they act like vegetables
Impeccable, my time for shinin' is now, incredible
So cop the record now before it's a collectible
All natural, the way we eat the flow is intangible
Fetuses that were raised to feed the beat like animals
Matter of fact, the facts in your paper's manufactured, not accurate
I got a whole track that can back me wit'
Blaow, I know a couple ladies that can end you right now
Skill that steady and we don't back down
Deadly with the tool of your choice, that's sound
Yeah, so how you like me now?"

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [The Lady Of Rage]:
I'm sick and tired of people askin' me why I ain't signed
Is the industry blind or just tryin' to block my shine?
This is rap, what you industry cats forgot 'bout rhymes
It's all 'bout dimes and I ain't tryin' to shake my behind
Beside, mine is too big for that
I don't fit into that
Stereotypical, hypocritical image that
I'm 'bout to bring lyrics back
Fuck playin' the stripper role
I ain't tryin' to grip the stripper pole just to get the gold
Now all my people know Rage is the original
Lyrical black widow, put rap in the hospital
Resuscitated, you fuckin' haters
I berated and gave you a way to escape
This Planet Of The Apes
You bastards swear you bananas and wouldn't bust grapes
Hip hop became a jungle for the monkeys and snakes
How long does it take to break through the phoney and fake?
One of the female greats
What mo' I gotta say?

[Hook]
