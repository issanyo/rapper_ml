His heart is cold
Hey

[Scratch Sample]
Showin' love to my peeps so my love don't change

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
Hi, it's the original seminal MC criminal
Literal lyrical, pinnacle of women who rap
The inhospitable unfuck-with-able villain
Sent here to finish you no subliminal
I'm just givin' you facts
I hit the track, the reaction is chemical
Spittin' you lines of invisible force
[i charged 10 of you wack?]
Empty MCs nobody's feelin' you, now I'm fillin' you up with premium
Leavin' 'em curious killin' these cats
I step in the rage without ya weapon and gage
It's like catching a fade with Kimbo
I slice up anyone of these bimbo's
And all the kinfolks, and never scuff up my timbos
(his heart is cold)
And mine been froze, I
I toss that ass out a limo window and into limbo
Now go switch up the tempo and murder the stage
See, she's aight but she's not Rage shit
Neither is he though
I'm ill, I need chemo
I'm live, it's no TiVo
Rewind my whole steelo
Magnificent flow evil
Magnificent no equal
And in the spur of the moment
I'm like the Spurs in that moment
And it hurt don't it
When I stick my spurs in my opponent
Geah

[MC Eiht]
G-g-g-g-g-geah
Showin' love to my peeps so my love don't change
G-g-g-g-g-geah
I-I-I-I still got love for the neighborhood
G-g-g-g-g-geah (geah)
Showin' love to my peeps so my love don't change
Criminal minded on you muthafuckas
I-I-I still got love

[Verse 2: MC Eiht]
It's the, original criminal
Y'all subliminal
Loc, I break it down to the last of minerals
That's any individual
Killin you'd be the pinnacle
For you to beat me it's gonna take a miracle
I'm so sick the heartbeat that hate made
Down by law, the ill streets and dues paid
Whack hoes and niggas is so flossy
Eiht remain true, my home girl is bossy
Grab the pad and pen tell tale's a struggle
The hood took me under, so niggas is in trouble
Necessary the roughness, so ruff fits
And rough and tough is only how this roughneck spits
Geah
You see allstars and clouds of endo
By any means a couple shooters right out your window
Now is it cold, Loc, the heart is rock stone
Niggas come with that whack shit socked and cocked on
Geah

[Outro]
