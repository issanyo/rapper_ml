I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

I rock on with my bad self 'cause it's a must
It's The Lady Of Rage still kickin' up dust
So mm, let me loosen up my bra strap
And mm, let me boost ya with my raw rap

'Cause I'ma break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, ya best believe a
This grand diva's runnin' shit with the speed of a cheetah

Meet a lyrical murderer I'm servin' 'em like two scoops of chocolate
Check it how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwin' bolos, ya better roll a Rollo
To find out I'm the number one solo, uh

The capital R A now take it to the G-E
I bring the things to light but you still can't see me
I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style
For those that try to punk me here's a Pamprin child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

Now I'm hittin' MC's like hit MC's like
(Hoo yu ken)
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the undisputed
So what you uh, wanna do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks

So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners
I got the tongue that is outdone anyone from the rising
To the setting of the sun or the moon

I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass poom
Boom, bam, God, daym
I'm hittin' so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks
Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk

Of the rhythm fresh that I give 'em
Let it hit 'em, split 'em, did it now I'm rid of 'em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Oh shit, I'm the shit
You can't get wit the Rage then tough tit tie

I pity the fool, that gets with the lyrical murderer 'cause my shit is rude
(Ooh)
You wanna get with the wickedness?
With that big botty that's kickin' it, rippin' it apart like Jason
You'll be, chasin' a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?

I'm steam pressurin' those who ain't measurin' up
I keep competitors stuck in the muck with they butt up
What chu wanna nut up like cashew
Don't you know that I will mash you? For real
That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farm ville, VA
(So what you gotta say?)

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs
(Rage)
Rock on, wit' cha bad self

Uh, I am the roughest, roughest, roughest
(Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest
(Rage)

Uh, I am the roughest, roughest, roughest
(Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest
(Rage)

Uh, I am the roughest, roughest, roughest
(Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest
(Rage)

Uh, I am the roughest, roughest, roughest
(Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest
(Rage)

Get with the uh, roughest, roughest
Get with the uh, toughest, toughest
(Rage)
Get with the uh, roughest, roughest
(Yeah)

Get with the uh, toughest, toughest
(Rage)
Get with the uh, wickedness, roughest
I am the uh, wickedness
(Rage)

Yeah, one-nine-nine-fo'
The indo blow and the grass grow
Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a hoe
But you gotta give credit when credit is due

Women back down and bow down to my motherfuckin' homegirl
The Lady Of Rage, she rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs
Handcuffed and she busts and trick biatch
She's guaranteed to tear shit up you know what I'm sayin'
