[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah, praise Jesus (quiet on the set!)
One time baby... (let's get this money baby)
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit amen
In the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ baby
(Yeah boy, hehe, Chase the Cat productions in the house)
Let's get this money baby (Playalitical on the track baby)
One time baby, one time baby
(Bizzy Bone, the Midwest Cowboy, bump that)
Whatever baby, yeah (yeah)

[Bizzy Bone]
And as we travel around the world (world)
Stackin that paper, stackin that paper
And tell me what's gonna really look good
I keep it poppin so these haters comin to hate us (get off, get off!)

I can answer you quicker than them
Shall I be can't keepin my mouth closed, keepin my mouth closed
I don't chase 'em they fuckin with me - you don't fuck with me
When I'm down and out though, when I'm down and out though
I keep 'em happy, they jealous of me
They jealousies no doubt yo, no doubt yo
And lookin for somethin they want to attack
Pushin 'em back, knockin 'em out cold, knockin 'em out cold (woo!)
What do you want from me, they don't want your dreams, they want reality
They get up inside yo' head
You tell 'em "I'm dead" and tell 'em "Get out of me"
Will they try to rob me in the direction we chill
I'm only movin by the grace of the Lord, it's God's hill
Huh, go get that vittle money, for real
They better not fuck with us, we get 'em honey, what the deal
There go the other testin, mic checker, dippin skill
For somebody to influence baby, I don't want nothin but liquor and beer
Huh, listenin into the hearts of a Bizzy, apart of me time to grow
And if you don't know me now, what do I know 'bout myself
I'm takin it slow, admit it I'm a little bit different than others
I'm takin it slowly cause no one can trust me, you my brother, you my brother
One time

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And as we travel around the world (world)
Stackin that paper, stackin that paper
And tell me what's gonna really look good
I keep it poppin so these haters comin to hate us, hate us (move out!)
And as we travel around the world (world)
Stackin that paper, stackin that paper
And tell me what's gonna really look good
I keep it poppin so these haters comin to hate us (get off, get off!)

[Bizzy Bone]
If you was fightin me, fightin behind me
Give me some money or give me some change
Steadily workin to keep it movin, if it was groovin I'd do it again
One of them now don't know what they playin and treatin the knowledge
Don't weak up the rhyme and they probably think that
Because of my brain I be runnin I'm comin to die, mine
Come in a time, medical federal, what is known don't have to be spoken
Do it congruently, makin the music so truly
I'm keepin it movin and leavin the secrets of pickin and movin and cyclin
Effortless player I don't want no Bentley baby, I'm keepin it quiet
Roll out, they start a riot, no now, baby don't even try it
No doubt, pickin up his die to get the mission with precision
That's the superstition set aside, showdown
I smoke the chronic baby, peace release me is mine, it is mine
Better go play babyyyyy - I'm sprayin this motherfucker
And let me go play baby - gonna go get a beer
Handle your business and diminish the thoughts
The elevation of survival when it's vital, the rock (rock)
Dedication of the love for myself, the love for my health
The love for my stealth, the love of everybody else
And I'm comin to meet that little baby, you stayin on top
You know what we do baby, solid as a motherfuckin rock

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
And don't even worry when we scurry up in the flurry, it's getting blurry
In the stormy of the purgatory, the thought for me
Wanna eat with the angels be patient, still wait for the party baby
What party? I party, you and your body baby
Right here, right now, get 'em up when they get down
Shake thoughts, don't know what they caught all in my brain now
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit amen
In the name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ amen
You better believe it, I will say it again, and again
Jesus! From this day forth, God willin
Lean back chillin, precious medal of steel, titanium
Nine percent of the cranium, baby you feel me?
No adultery-dultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee, we kill 'em
Stays dry for me daddy, baby sunset
Come get a taste of what you never had, you ain't cum yet?
When we raise up the one, yes, poppa he got you
Standin right beside you in the midst of the storm
Baby I ride with you, never die, not in spirit
It can't get much fuckin clearer, did you hear it? Yes!

[Chorus]
