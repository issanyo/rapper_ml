[Bizzy - talking]
DJ U-Neek, we need to take 'em back to the projects, man
Like 1988, let me hit somethin real quick
We are Way 2 Strong

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
(We in the projects, projects, yeah)
I'm Thuggish Ruggish and Way 2 Strong
I'm Thuggish Ruggish and Way 2 Strong
(We in the projects, projects, yeah)
I'm Thuggish Ruggish and Way 2 Strong
I said Way 2 Strong, I said Way 2 Strong
Way 2 Strong, Way 2 Strong, Way 2 Strong

[Verse 1: Bizzy]
Somebody hide my homeboy
And I'm prayin those same old enemies try some  things
One of my friends is comin with or without ya
Plus, I'm finna flip out then disappear in the rain
Those suckas can sue me, do me ain't seen a thing
Prison may make me loyal, murda may make me scream
I Been bustin with regime, fiend gonna rob me
For The Love Of $, cash, shots around me
Rebel with a cause with a sawed-off buckshot
Good side, pass off five shots
If I shot that boss glass eye go cock, cock, Glock watch
Man's life shall squash
Now I've struck like war, pump like war, pump like war
And so, you follow me for triple dollar bill
What's your salary? you can holler then go fall when you talk
(????????) the general
When the federal general's on a mission
(?????????)

[Chorus: repeat 2x]

[Verse 2: Bizzy]
Projects like Y-A, sell rocks slide in my low-low, for sho'
Grab my pesos, compadre slow down don't take my photo
In a mo-mo lookin out the window with a four- four
Why you roll solo? cuz don't nobody know what I know, fo sho'
Buy my weed hoes, Little Eazy tell Jesus to let me be
I drink Hennessey til I can't see, where's my regime?
Smack, Pennsylvania my end's low
I'm still in my Lexus smokin perfecto's, pumpin petro
Baby let's go, I got death notes
Till the rap flow in the wind (wind) tinted up again (again), in 89 on twins
(twins)
Tell my secret to the moonlight, praise God makin my tomb right
To my friends, hop out the Benz if you are envious of my ends
Hop out the Benz if you are envious of my ends

[Chorus: repeat 2x]

[Verse 3: Bizzy]
Envious, envious, well they're just no one
Envious, envious, well they're just no one
Envious, envious, well they're just no one
Envious, envious, well they're just no one
End it all for the kids
Mamma wanna know what I did, when I had no place to live
Addicted to ghetto violence, me and my nigs
Gimme a swing, kick that shh...
And the devil strikes on the runway to L.A
I remember the day with Little Eazy and Krayzie
History in the makin finally made it
I can't wait to get pay, and I signed at 17
Fuckin with my thugz, we thought we had it made
I better wake up, but I was young the drunk off the Hen
And so was my friendz
And I ended up broke with platinum records, no, not again
Then, then, then, then, then, will the end begin
Nobody knows, bitches don't suppose
And it might be 1999, then it might be 2004
Baby, let's roll for the 7th Sing, seven, seven
Man, they don't know I started this in 85

[Chorus: repeat 2x]
