Sandals we seekin', candle I need no babylon, feelin' opressed
Don't even stress the word (?), cause we the champion's
Champagne be poppin', we limo drivin' side by side
And yes we get it on, one time most definitely
Further the mind, shallow waters and know life
Give me that water and love, we gotta make it together
Remember it's only one
In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit come
Tobacco, we goin' fishin' with the tackel, catchin' the snapper
Further the mind of grapple, diamond and ruby shinin'
Blue as a sapphire, and we're watched dreams
Somebody pass me the lighter, cause we champion's
And we lookin' for them good pastures, lookin' for good pastures
Cause in my water feelin' so captured, look up and see the flowers
Heavenly Father thank you, I'm leanin' back and stayin' faithful

Ha, Ha, Ha... That's right... Welcome back Bizzy Bone

See as we pay attention, little children they are listening
All pay attention to the best that you can
You my homeboy, my friend, here to the very end
So many things I wanna tell you bang I'm ready to start
I really love you for the pressin' of all
When a we surrounded by the people, whatever you want
Indians, little baby is it just Flesh {mumbling} I love you
Yes I confess, the test of the faithful
Helpin' me set 'em through, may we float
And accept what you gave us and never go
So I praise you I thank you and tryin to relax
Dear grandpa your faithful servant is back
Because I love you

And the bums ain't the bums
And this money ain't the money, money you know where we from
And the slums ain't the slums, and the bums ain't the bums
And this money ain't the money, money you know where we from
And the slums ain't the slums, and the bums ain't the bums

And this money ain't the money, baby you know where we from
And the slums ain't the slums, and the bums ain't the bums
And this money ain't the money, money you know where we from
One love...
