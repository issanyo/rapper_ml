[Chorus 1:]
Gambling man
Rambling man
Handling man
Tip that hour glass
Stew pigeon
He ran outta sand
He’s got like 45 robots
Cause he more than his men
I sort of offend
Cause I’m too fuckin thug to blend in

[Chorus 2:]
Some a these niggas faded
They act like they so paid
But when I’m standing with my niggas
Niggas have nothin to say [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Don’t be thinkin you’re tough
Thinkin you’re hard
Hundreds a problem
Apartment get sold
So it’s best not to be gettin involved
Thinkin they big an they really just no
They rollin with pussies
I’m rollin with dogs
None a my brothers are ready to fall
She can get real
When you get killed
Gambling man
Your brother gets spilled
Tearin it down whatever you build
[?]
Peelin it back [?]
It’s all about family
It’s all about cash
Gotta get first and you never get last
Look to your future but run from your past
Know where you at
Don’t gamble like that
You gotta make moves
And you gotta think fast
You going too fast and you might just crash
Then you get taken out like the trash
How to blend in when you listen to we
My light shining bring
Well your light shining dim
You fuckin with us if we do it’s the end
Not a good look for you and your friends
You and you’re an your man’s gon have to learn
Fuckin with killas you gonna get burned
Puttin their body all up in the [?]
One by one they all gettin their guns
We taking them down if they acting like clowns
Actin they lost and they really ain’t found
They talkin that shit
And this word gets around
And I’m all in their grill
And they makin the sound

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2:]
My [?] smell like lavender
Ain’t showed you what I’nna reap as yet
Exes on all a your callenders
38 caliber, spinnin that
You a freak
I’m that nigga with Mel Chezedeek, you fuckin  idiot
Bow down to the omnipotence
Word to Busy, you fuckin sissies
Fag niggas get no dick
Send em to San Francisco
My bitch in Santa Barbera
Ready to get it crackin [?]
Peter Lincoln driving
Arriving higher than the titans
[?]
Never panic, never run, never hide
Chizzle me from my good side
Picture they speak a thousand of em
Your words don’t mean a fuckin thing
I’m smell coward inside of every one of em
I’m takin this leap of faith
Believing in a higher power
Believe in your meteorologist
It’s gonna rain like in forty hours
You mothafuckas believe everything
Get em some sweet n sour chicken
Knowledge it will never stop
Cause the truth is all that [?]
Wake up and brush my teeth
I’m smell that mooch in my sleep
I wouldn’t do this to my worst enemy
So I just watch over me

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3:]
Like they mouth is washed up
And they got nothin to talk about
Keep quiet when I’m standing in their path
They walk around
Far from gangsta
I stare the bitch in their eyes
No money, no souped up ride
Ain’t making no moves
All they do is get by
Faking everything
Living other people’s lives
Everybody thinks [?]
When it really comes to it
Alot a ya’ll don’t wanna die
Even with chips stacked up
I’mma still try
Never gon quit
Til it’s time for me to flatline
Cause I’m a gambling man
That’s why I’m ready to go I’m out
I’m hittin everything in sight
So you betta put up a fight
Or else you going towards the lot
I’ll send some thugs on ya
Put your brain  asleep with the pump on ya
Time to raise the stakes and I won’t warn ya
Whether he build up and strike on ya
Going against [?] will make you a goner
But you don’t want that so get the fuck off my corner
Everytime somebody drops
The block gets warmer
[?]
Best thing for you to do
Is to stay out my way
While I’m out here choppin
Unless you see the popo watching, creeping up
I’mma keep going cause I’m never stopping
If you wanna keep gambling then it’s on and poppin
I’ll make you meet the angels where your bodies droppin
From tryin to come hard but you’re soft, floppin
Play fuckin cards
Big dog is not coppin

[Chorus 2]

[Outro:]
Gambling man
