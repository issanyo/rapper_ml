Out of the slums, in the midst of the darkness
And come in, they callin, all in
Ready for the mission when they listen
Many people, many children
Better touch em;deliver the one, better tell em'
You can ride to the rhythm, come on
And get your gun on, run on, the Benz along
Already, Christ to the rhythm for keepin the boat steady
Everybody gather around to protect him
The lesson of the spiritual, kick kids and every
Everyone is going through their shit, and thats ??
No we not angels, and different for the feelin'
Troopin' in the galaxy????
???? the process, normally
Givin all my money to the poor and the streets keep orderly
Sort of like a weapon, we sharin, we still carin'
Motherfuckers blessed and in heaven everybody sharin'
Some of us try so hard to get attention
Nonsense, thinking tellin' me who was winning
But the fellas ain't finna forgive all the lies
Never the spies wise, and you heard battle cry
You'll never see my face or my eyes, no way
Headed to a place, nobody don't know my name
No lames, no shame, no game, no blame, no mess, no dress, no thanks (let's crush this pain)
You'll never see my face or my eyes, no way
We headed to a place, nobody don't know my name
No game, no lame, no shame, no blame, no mess, no dress, let's crush this pain

Now if you still got some gangsta in you, I want you to put your pistol in the air, and let that motherfucker go buck buck buck

Dear Lord, hit em in the head; word written in red
Candle lit with the light and the beer
Burn it up, try to fight to the death like this
Tell em what we doing and we moving with their peers
Doin' in a ditch
Turnin around, they shit dipin' around, the whip flippin around
The kids skippin the rims, and did that with the fish
Bizzy and the kizzy, is he coming around, they kick it
I know you with it and then we with it to the fullest, to the bullets, to the bullpits
Duckin through the bullshit
Running the game, and automatic with the torches
Trenches, henches, lynches, horses, forces, choices, orchids, Jinns
Endorsed with the sword, just normally morbid, fortress, soldiers cordially cautious
Fire's are still in that orchid
Man, damn, life in the ville, no flim flam
Yes the lord has a plan, The lord has a man
In us and I trust in him, and he perfect
We human, thuggin and get it, scoopin the ladies out of Hades
So it's cool like 80, cursed them, inflection, protection
In the section; young gifted and crazy
And laetly playin up these radio stations
Twista, X-man, Jimmy, gimme that money
Gimme that songs, we thugged out
These voice tell in harmony with the symphony
Grind and keep inside of the hood, still
Mic check, left right, would you?
Grand Pappa keeping me safe like....
Big Pappa understood the hood

My father and grandfather so happy to be in existance, alive
My understanding the meanings, the reason is like the answer on how to survive
How to rewind, make it through affectionately
I'm getting as close as i can, as yall teach me to be a man
I stand for something thats more grand
The rest of the fam, demonous the winds
Abraham , bring some of the Jinns
Timothy ????? and all of the candles be pointin to sin
I thank the light, creator from darkness, the angel just wanting the love
But the love that he has can never be bought, and i thank him and call him a dove
Plus he love Allah, and plus the son and I know that he love me aswell
My name is Glory and Jesus' my dad, even if all of the children fail
We'll never fail, better be careful, the mysterys ?? of the holy grail
Angels still on your trail, you worship the lord, you'll always prevail
Never could teach, I tried to preach, you know what they do to me, want to be righteous
Just instead of my stuck in the shelters, I'm kinda famous, singin' it right
Grandfather, I'm feelin' I heard the balance the talent like I was told
Make me strong from the ?? invisible things Bizzy Bone can't be boned
