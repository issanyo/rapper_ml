So many soldiers standing on the block yeah
Trying not to get shot, ohh love my thug ways
I'm an American soldier [2x]
Just an American soldier
I'm an American soldier

Saint? Regerman? early in the morning like a veteran
It's the way we do it can't nobody do it better man
Afghan children cover up their women and
From here to river Jordan you gon' treat em like a gentleman
Come home, shell shock, we be rebuilding pac ol' block
President Obama look at all the purple hots I got
Can't stop, won't stop, don't stop, purple block
The killer gta be fully aware of why the gunshots
Post ups, set up position, trained position
30 round of a magazine, M16

I been made my decision, God country, God willing
The land of the brave, the slaves, we Gods children
When I die, I? them flags of a bullet on my nigga
Take my packback? and take a swing out off the glass
People don't know the half, Allah means Jesus
And anybody can ask

So many soldiers standing on the block yeah
Trying not to get shot, ohh love my thug ways [x2]
I'm an American soldier [x2]
Just an American soldier
I'm an American soldier
