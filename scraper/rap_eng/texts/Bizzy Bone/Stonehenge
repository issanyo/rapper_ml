Cause I'm a keep my stones cleansed out to the Stonehenge
And we gon' keep it stone cold right to the bone bone
Won't have to baptize me already did that
Won't have to chastise me where is the kid at

Different obstacles warrants from being victimized (victimized)
I summarize my solutions, think restitution and realize (realize)
I live my life on the stage, presence of pain
And I'm thinking if I had fangs nobody would bother me
Jesus had a plan before anyone ever knew me
I'm regarded as a sell out, I'm a false friend, but the truth be
I was the one who was sold out ? and I think you know
I was born to sing these heavenly songs of soul
A fifth of my spoils, like a fifth of my crown royal
Loyalty bring royalty and prison over in the coil
Toil the soil, righteous, tightened, and never humble
Till the word comes and the sun still shine, hearted purple
Man anytime the the dawg be smoking airs precious
My depression don't matter His best friend the ?
Long as it's Jesus I understand commotion
?
This baby the ice is nice hit ya like kimbo slice

Cause I'm a keep my stones cleansed out to the Stonehenge
And we gon' keep it stone cold right to the bone bone
Won't have to baptize me already did that
Won't have to chastise me where is the kid at

Footprints you making the hood price you gotta any good since
Now gimme the incense sense and what if I could hence ? goodness
Now gimme the arrow spittin' spittin' swords dead pharaohs
Everybody abort
It's only the Lord narrow rippin the courts of the terror
It's cool you in my ghetto
My niggas runnin from po po oh no ? dead No No!
Hit em with true ammo
Will I get the payment they don't know what a nigga was saying
And now they illuminated. B B the dirt rock with a ? Glock
Now look at the back of the dolla How dare you call I'm a psyclopse
? with the slice, murder me twice
The price of the crossbows, crossroads and the ?
This baby the ice is nice hit ya like kimbo slice
Whether we all in the nothin I got something for the moment
You want it the Bone come see my Stonehenge

Cause I'm a keep my stones cleansed out to the Stonehenge
And we gon' keep it stone cold right to the bone bone
Won't have to baptize me already did that
Won't have to chastize me where is the kid at
