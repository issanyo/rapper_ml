And the world is so sad...

All I want you to do is murder me
Murder me, murder me, murder me, murder me
Please come murder me

In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted
Oh I believe in don't eat any forbidden fruit oh please don't touch it
You think that I want you but no
You know I don't
And I would not risk my family for fantasy
An illusion that moves the man in me, ho
Oh, so blowed
And don't even think of tempting me w/ ecstacy
(Rewind the tape so I can hit it again)
Even though we argue I call you the black widow
Never will I fall in Indo, throw it out the window
(Rewind, Goddammit!)
Baby baby baby baby baby
Think your body was banging, jim bag, but baby
Gotta be crazy
All these dope fiend bitches
Go get that ass tested
And conjour up a name and call all my niggas you put to rest
And Lord bless him
But the lord won't bless them

Hey, In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted
Oh I believe in don't eat any forbidden fruit oh please don't touch it
It's my family for fantasy
An illusion that moves the man in me, ho
Oh, so blowed
And don't even think of tempting me w/ ecstacy
And touching me's like sex to me
Even though we argue I call you the black widow
Never will I fall in Indo, throw it out the window
Baby baby baby baby baby
Think your body was banging, jim bag, but baby
Gotta be crazy
All these dope fiend bitches
Go get that ass tested
And conjour up a name and call all my niggas you put to rest
And Lord bless him
But the lord won't bless them

In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted
Oh I believe in don't eat any forbidden fruit oh please don't touch it
In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted
In the beginning it was Adam and it was Eve in whom we trusted
You think that I want you but no
You think that I want you but no

In the beginning it was got him, and got him, and got him
I'd like to... embalm your body and do her like John Gotti
Black widow, and (Sheeni's?) your pimp, ho
Need a little expose, so you... just flip my papers then hey
Gotta let them know, bitch you won't rape us, no!
Probably smoking stones like your mama
And I heard you're sucking dick
Cause the pussy's got the heaven syph-i-lis
And chicks in common gotta run away
Watch you wither and say
I told you so, I told you so, I told you
Hey, get up out my head
Hey, get up out my head
Hey, get up out my head
Hey, get up out my...
155 lbs, get it in feel it
It's the wicked seduction
It's the wicked seduction

All my niggas is fucking
Niggas just straight buggin', buggin'

And the world is so...
