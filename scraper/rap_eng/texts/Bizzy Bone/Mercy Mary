The meaning of a mother named "Mercy Mary"
Attack of the love, the hug that steadily refuse
Ever suffer the trouble, the problem that picks at the very weary
Call it disease, but baby I'm just weeded, heated blazon, for those P.O.D'ed
Hypno n moet jewel, for the few gon get the glee ton
All we r is Mo Thug, taking off since our regime
It's the mercenary of the whole team
N puff the green, until we all with kings in the seas
Problem's our knees up above ah
Put it to Solva, yo baby ask for alcohol in the wrong y'all I won't bust no drama
To the pack of Dom of Perignon or (Malarial?) it's all here
Ain't no Hollywood, my bid is Hollyhood n the souls got hustle
Kill can u feel that Mista Ripsta, hmm I just can't breath
Hmm be ready to d-lo these plz rest in peace
In a death the souls will increase
Till they each get ready for the son of Mary
Hurry in the case of each of my mercenary's
Mercenary, Mercy Mary, Mercy Mary, mercenary

Yo while they like or not, gotta leave us alone, Hey!
Let's tell em "get up off of our ass" n what if don't say?
What do they know about love, what do they know about home, home
Beautiful doves and plenty of love, I say it again if u want now come on
I'm loyally walking, n praying, n talking about my day upon my heartache
Kinda had saw, my feet is my car, we specially dark, shhhh ahh
But people they saw me again n they get on the road, u already know
The quicker, the better I'm felling about but I live in the drop(alarm?)
Nobody is better we keeping it moving, it's hard as ever, forgive what I've done
N repent in our dues, n know what I do's, n keeping it cool, now what do we loose?
We keepin it moving, n rapping "so lord forgive what I done" n singing our dues
And living our dues, tell me what do we choose
Mercenary, Mercy Mary, Mercy Mary, mercenary

They keep on telling me I don't know nothing, I like that, but I fight that
Jesus insight that "And baby Bryon u can go and re sight that"
Yeah, to the pipe line, tell em how much u love me
Gotta string on chain game, (Pauly?) I know u hug me
A cynical so political let me tickle your mind
I'm kissing the ground
