[Intro]
Now this is what I'm talking about, baby, haha
And this is for the weed heads, and this is for the weed heads
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
And this is for the weed heads, and this is for the weed heads
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O

[Chorus]
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O

[Verse 1]
Why don't we legalize reefer leaves and nines?
Some of them say we evil
Little somethin', somethin' for my people
And though I know that weed'll even out your day
Love everything green, well that's what Nas used to say God say
Gonna get ya fucked up, wanna get ya fucked up
When you take one hit that'll make you hush up
Nigga, shut the fuck up
No stems, no indo and chronic
Hydro, Thai stick and I can think of some more, oh yes
Time to smoke sess, oh
I know high day come around on Friday
Pour up our Deebo, yes and we pray
That the reefer help me see more everyday
Wouldn't it, couldn't it be Heaven-sent?
One hell of a superstar bowl every first Friday of the month
And you're humbly invited, we're truly humbly united
Enemies and all of y'all, hate on when I get my fade on
I'm so high

[Chorus]
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O

[Verse 2]
In Booyah, smokin' the potent Buddha, Buddha
It ain't nothin' like that Buddha lover bomb shit
Fat enough that it'll make me move ya, sooth ya
Reefer creeper, seepin' in my sneakers
Seepin' in miss Shiva, heave her, nigga
You better believe us
Even when we lonely, weed won't leave us
Not like these fake niggas that deceive us
All day the weed man dizzy and he be callin' when it's seedless
Life ain't easy, put it on Eazy, but we still breathin'
Takin' a hit of the reefer, sendin' me straight to Heaven
Chokin' with my breezy, that herbal healin'
Don't you wanna feel that feelin'?
Don't you wanna spend your scrilla?
And givin' the weed to the killas
Makin' 'em forget why they killin', hell yeah
I heard they heard, they heard they out here fuckin' wit pills
Nigga, those chemicals will make you ill so get off the ecstasy
So to the realers, mysterious and pass the rush
Off a box (A box)
Sellin' me skunk (Skunk)
Out of me trunk (Trunk)
Sure 'nough, sure 'nough, sure 'nough, sure 'nough

[Chorus]
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O

[Verse 3]
Talk that talk until we tote that, love that, that
Don't legalize 'cause they know we can groove
Gettin' high just to get by
Through all the suicides and homicides and genocides
And drive-bys, walk-bys gonna multiply
And chalk lines all the time in the H, double-O, D: hood
And the wood grain, and it ain't all
Where it ain't all, when it ain't all, when it ain't all good
Started at eleven, stealin' weed from poppa's keeper
And even though you beat us, I got to thank you for the reefer
Never mess with white girls, but I roll with white boys
Niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight joints, tight joints
My shit is swollen, you shouldn't be rollin'
Never no green leaves, it'll make your heart bleed for the mornin'
Just go on and let me split up the weed and silently sober
No jokin', when the neighbor's door's open, you want to come over
We smokin', smokin', and now we tokin', tokin'
And then we chokin', chokin', chokin', chokin'
Chokin', chokin', chokin', chokin'
I'm so high

[Chorus]
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
So who want a bag? Who want a bag?
You want a bag, you want a bag, you got a bag
So send 'em out the door to the liquor store
Get a bag of dope and a quarter O
