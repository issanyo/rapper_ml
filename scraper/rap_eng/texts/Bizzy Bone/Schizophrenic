(Bizzy)
Yeah, Daddy's the crackhead
Mama's just lookin' for love
Marijuana, weedman, little thug
We don't call him Steven
Breathin' in the garden of Eden
Eve was corrupted body combusted from the flames
Cleveland ain't give me nothin' but game
Goin' insane and It's rainin' bloody murder, murder
Chillin' in the gun range servin' on the corner, corner, chop, chop
Watch for the po po, drop top switches on the lo lo
Your skinny nigga with the fo fo
Make more hot tips like off in Dodge City
Elevation say they ain't gonna dodge Bizzy like my kin folk
In the lock down love I don't even budge
Cause I don't know you
And I'm sure to get my thug on, ho
Who that baby's daddy, daddy is beatin' your nigga
Where his Caddy is?
He probably mad in fact don't panic
Profanity I'm schitzophrenic
How do we manage so frantic and calm
With the bombay sneakin' on me, baby

(Chorus)
In the battle zone, battle zone
Y'all near the end, y'all near the end, y'all near the end
In the battle zone, battle zone
Y'all near the end, y'all near the end
When I bust ‘em on down
In the battle zone, battle zone
When I bust ‘em on down
When I bust ‘em on down
In the battle zone, battle zone
Y'all near the end, y'all near the end
When I bust ‘em on down

(Bizzy)
Little Layzie feelin' the Quija shit it ain't easy
Niggas beneath me tryin' to deceive me
Wanna defeat me please not even these could keep me
All on the wave length buck to the bang
Why they gotta stay and make me faint?
War paint, walk the plank
Fuck the bass smokin' hay
Me, I ain't no joke
And then some more dope then you'd ever know
E-I-L-O, hello
When I'm all by myself let it go, let it go, let it go
Rollin' with my posse your way, hell no
Draped in Versace got me on lock
Did they rock the bells and play
Straight from the Glock, Glock love block later tears away
And consequences got me drinkin' free, yes i'll pay
And that's a pain ‘cause I was stuck in a rutt, you'd say
How do we stay in the war zone
Bizzy Bone, gotta phone and then lay on the floor gone, goin' on
Probably know we read
It's hard to be in Bone here we are
In and out your car, and calm
Call me in the 7th song
Regime, you can't get in the battle zone

(Chorus)

(Bizzy)
I see no black queen, nigga searched it
Then your other boys cursed the term
Run up your weave with one hand
I don't show no mercy
Of course!
Who the fuck is a six, six, six, seven make the mayhem
Start blastin' on you, bitch
I come relentless where your killas at?
Posted up both of my henchmen
Remember then, Twista when you wasn't aluminum foil
Strive to strike gold
And it might go slightly less dissin' the loyal
Money say I'm the royalty
Heltah Skeltah and Speedknots
Oh, you got lots of shit to say
You better respect me, mothafucka!
Seance and they knock me off with the Valium
Buy your bitch from my madallions
While my posse scopin' you ho's
Slide my Mazarati to that slick bitch
Yeah that trick bitch
I'm ruthless, Bone Thugs, Bone Thugs, sign who?
Get at ‘em, nigga!

(Chorus)

(Bizzy)
We got it jumpin' like peanuts
Get up and see us
Fuck with the words to the song all night long
Baby, believe us damn my man keep bumpin' my back
Get you some rhythm, musta just got outta prison
Skippin' the kid but you with him
Do the walk say, “FUCK THE COPS!”
Give it up some hardtimes gettin' in
Welcome to the bar, baby
We thuggin', huggin' this broad
And she rubbin' on me squeezin' my ass
Better check your pockets
Better not steal my cash
Ask Cube we be clubbin', clubbin', clubbin'
I'm your nigga in a bucket, like fuck it
He think he ballin' in a Mercedes 600
But he wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't
But he wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't

(Chorus til fade)
