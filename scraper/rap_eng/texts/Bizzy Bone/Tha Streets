[Intro: Bizzy Bone]
Rest in peace Karlos Shammar Davis
7th Sign soldier, A.K.A. Low Down
Rest in peace nigga, I love you (yeah)
It's just the dirty 7 in this motherfucker
Killers incorporated motherfucker (ha ha)
Little Capo in this bitch, Rasu in this motherfucker
Mo Thug millenium, Thugline nigga (what?)
Bring yellow niggas back in style, B

[Bizzy Bone]
The streets smothered me, crack smothered me and the brothers
I wanna move out of this country, get away from ya motherfuckers
Momma was cheatin and sleepin with somebody else's nigga
A bastard is born quick, Little B got half-sisters
Liquor ridiculous, watchin my niggas die quickly
Speak from the spirit, they comin with me
And that's for runnin with me, dirty money, I'm still hungry
Club niggas is yuppies, guppies fuckin these little bitty puppies
Fresh outta prison, nigga rusty, but I'm mackin nonetheless
Bullets is followin but, Bizzy is feelin lucky
So why you muggin me thug, you really ain't buggin me bitch
And Little Capo keep lookin, that's cause he really love me
The streets smothered me, crack smothered me and the brothers
I wanna move out of this country, get away from motherfuckers
9-millimeter, it don't cover me
I'm caught up in this motherfuckin fuckery
7th Sign, nigga

[Chorus 2X: Capo Confucious] + (Bizzy)
All we got is us homie rollie, in God we trust
God bless my niggas, thug love (hell yeah)
Only way that we ever gon' get to rise
Togetherness as we ride, 'til we meet out demise

[Capo Confucious]
22 years and still countin, clockin collateral
Baffled while we really here up against obsticles, I'm a radical
Killer Capo Confucious, throw up my fist if we compatible
No love? Fuck it, then let's battle
Ammo explode, machine gun rattle
Everybody scatter hysterical, sirens, police patrol (woo)
But they keep on rollin soon as they see
That this O.G., took back controllin the streets
Probably some real niggas, got me heated, state your beef
These bitches need to practice what they preach, capiche?
Rest in peace Martin Luther King (who) truly was a bigger man than me
Turned the other cheek, nigga please!
Generation X are in this for the weak, just a little sneak peek
Preview of what I came to do - simply dominate
Won't tolerate, dispute, nickel-plated, aim to shoot 'em up
Suggest you pussies keep your lip shut or get fucked

[Chorus]

[Prince Rasu]
United we stand, divided we fall
For the same bullshit, like snipers on White House lawns
In the same hood shit, got niggas from Compton to Africa
On that thug shit, Reginold Deny, any comment?
I lost my blood reppin Karlos Davis
I can't love shit, unless the fullest extent is given
I'm above this, deception, I know the intentions
Weapons of thug shit, if ever they step out of line
From ashes to dust bitch! Ride, never been far from grave
Since the murder, never been afraid
My cradle had a guage close by, when my father was stressed
Momma had asked him to leave as she departed to death
And ever since I've been convinced that it's, kill or be killed
Had the young mind of a scholar, but society failed
Josiah Ben Rasu, they caged my brother
Back in 9-6 but now in Armageddon, we ridin forever

[Chorus]
