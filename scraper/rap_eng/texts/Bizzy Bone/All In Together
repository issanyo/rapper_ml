[Intro]
Yeah, ha, that's what I'm talkin' about y'all
(All in together now, now)
It's another studio rap production
(What are you doing to me)
Please believe me, yeah come on baby
(I like the way she do's it)
Let me show 'em how we do it
(And she loves the way I does it)

[Chorus]
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say

[Verse 1]
You can ride it all night, feel the erection deep in your section
I gotta pocket full of protection, she's sleepin'
I'm cookin' breakfast, heh
Still gettin' followed by those hip-hop fans
It ain't a thang for me to get swallowed, I get zip-hop head
Let me be your baby daddy, I keep sprayin'
And please don't be that misunderstood, I'm from the hood
It'll be good to be dead, talk about taste that
Get it on, don't waste that, eat it all, like asap
Video recorded, watch how we play it back
Did it all, like way back, live it up, and lay back
Soon as I reach my climax, hit the weed, and freak the black
Lookin' at me while I'm countin' this money stacks
So sexy, your man be cryin' and don't he say yeah
You could get the best of me, watch my back
You could take charge, while we in the car
Gon' make me lick that ass, be in your stomach
And nervous you heart, talk about taste that, get it all
Don't waste that, eat it all, like asap
Video recorded, watch how we play it back

[Chorus]
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say

[Verse 2]
How many people have slept in your bed, it's one of my questions
Please, that's why we at the hotel
Respect the presidential suite, eatin' up all of my strawberry's
Drinkin' up all of my good Belvi
With a pocket full of magnum rubbers, double XL
That's what they tell me, anything, like "B" I love you
Baby you know you lyin', you only know Bizzy, you don't know Brian
You think that my bud is to soft, I see you cryin' pitiful
And don't get mad, you fuck 'em for strictly physical
I fucked you with spiritual, up, my baby's mommas
And she know who she is
And she can never come get that taste again
I'm comin' to get my rim, but I think you know this
And I got people in the streets wonderin'
How'd you ever get close to one of my fortresses
I gave you marriage, didn't know what to do with it
Confused on top of the stick shift
Didn't know how to work my clutch knit whit
And I tried to teach the taste of temptation
To take the ticket, I had to leave you
As soon as you pulled that trigger, you so wicked

[Chorus]
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say

[Verse 3]
Here's the words, I love you like the Felatio baby
Don't smother, we came at the same time, uhh, you like that
Each silouette she teach pilouette eat me wrong
Don't you rock that, little freaky deaky, sneak in the back
Of the four door, you like that, won't you try that
Let me put it up in the door...Roooh!...to the 'lation
Elevation take us standin' with wickeness
Tendecies candle wick and it's hot, you got me shakin'
Soon as I'm finished, I roll up some spinach
And fillish the village my niggas, and killas
And dealas, got a low down work, and the bitch was mysterious
Somebody wanna kill us, MOB like bail, bitch
I'm best when I'm thuggin', check my energy out of the retro
And I'm thuggin' in Columbus, yeah, long live the king
And the queen, but our whole regime, and a beam
From tipsy bitches, flip these tipsy bitches, lets split
Man a bitch can cut me, fuck my homies
Be a dyke and spike my hennesey, it gotta be satan testin' me
Only God control my destiny
And your other nigga don't impress me
Watch suckas for the lust of that deadly, meadly
Love me, let's be friends, let's be friends
Uhh, yeah

[Chorus]
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say
All in together now (now, now, now)
What are you doing to me (to me, to me)
I like the way she do's it
And she loves the way I does it
Makes a brotha really wanna say
