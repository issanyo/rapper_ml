[Chorus]
They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

[Layzie]
Look dog, I'm a thorough bred, pistol towin' hard head
Killer, for the scrilla man hittin' you with this hot lead
Trin said a, nobody does it better, wanna G-P with a thug
Nigga better get your shit together, and polish pimpin' players
All of my partners pushin' somethin' when it was eighty-nine
I was packin' nines sellin' dope and dump, buck, buck, buck
Uh, uh, uh ain't that the shiznit Layzie Bone got some money
Cause Layzie Bone handled his business, y'all niggas be slackin'
Up, try to be me actin' up you need to be tryin' to do you
Cause doin' me to flashy for you (yeah) say my name and watch
These bitches come flockin' I'm comin' hard stunnin' all them
These haters be watchin' droppin' bombs like a Taliban
Dress like a L.A. Mexican psycho like Norman Bates
When it comes down to cheddar man (y'all just don't know)
What it took to get here talkin' blood, sweat and tears
Right in the perfect timin' payin' my dues and every years

[Chorus]
They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

[Bizzy]
Mista miraculous with the acrobatic word play, these bitches
Ain't worthy suck it like you never know her pain
Most motherfuckin' certainly throw up the seven fuck your gang
We down and dirty me and Lay tight with the Nelly and his homie
Murphy only mid-day with a stomach full of henny I'm a spiritual
Y'all earthly close the curtains nigga shot for the door
Protective custody don't drop the soap Bubba want in, whooh
Hope to die of thee arrow back to the back stabber math-matical
Habitat the meniacal mad man and gettin' plastered watchin' the
Strippers work hard for they money in-doors they lookin' lovely
This is Babylon seventh sign roughin' it rug wordy ("B" bust your
(Whooh) Motherfuckin' head nigga) only killas can hurt me, it's all
Cool in the gang celebratin' the Bobby very agressive we talkin'
Y'all soul flikes too nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me

[Layzie]
We got the whole world walkin' brave, showin' dudes how to rock the
Stage when L-L was rock 'n bail I was scramblin' get my pockets
Paid, and I ain't stoppin' 'til I'm in my grave master 'til the casket
Drop, never leave the crib without my plastic Glock, stop, no pain
Don't want that in my vocabulary I promise not to do it nigga 'less
It's absolutely necessary, feel my vibe, drunk, twisted and high go
On ahead do you the grass and greener on the other side

[Bizzy]
Oh my God we always into somethin' illegal gettin' a painful plaque
Of the Saint they kept in the crib, duckin' the haters Eastside
Northside for sure throw up the bomb 'fore I leave this bitch Murda
Mo, Cleveland Avenue 1-6-1 the enforcers 'member the 3's Krew, Green
Brought half in turns, I don't need you, he who says alone I'm readin'
A song with the sevens I'm the dog from above, motherfucker

[Chorus]
They wanna be just like me, look just like me, dress just like me
And act just like me, wanna sound just like me
And rap just like me, get bitches like me, but can't chill like me (x4)
