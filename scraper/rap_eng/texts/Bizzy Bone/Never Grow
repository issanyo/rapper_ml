You better be careful where you go
Be careful where you go
Be careful where you go
Be careful where you go
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow
You better be careful where you go
The army's on way
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow
The army's on way
How does it feel that way, feel that way, the army's on way
How does it feel that way, feel that way, the army's on way
Ahh, you'll never or you'll never grow

(Bizzy)
You better be careful where you go
What am I supposed to do?
What? Telling me ya'll feeling me
Been livin' up in a material world
Ya'll killing me, ya'll killing me
Really, really, act so silly
Til he hit 'em in the middle of the kidneys
And he fall, all over a sin
Letting it feel that way, feel that way
Get yourself killed that way
Victorious-ous-ous-ous
And put him in cuffs, fucked him up, up, up, up
And wake up, wake up, wake up
By the caffeine and green and nicotine and a Ute Ferrari, aye
Come around our way (yeah)
You always wanna party
You gotta handle your business
Can I get a witness?
Mmm hmm, what part of the game is this?
If we were in the islands, I would fry your whole tribe
Sicilian style while add enough break wide
As I come back with the vibe
And I throw up near side
Grimy niggas I can feel ya
I've been here the whole time

(Chorus)
The army's on way
The army's on way
Ahh, you'll never grow
The army's on way
The army's on way
Ahh, you'll never grow, you'll never grow
The army's on way
Ahh, you'll never grow
Ahh, you'll never grow
The army's on way
Ahh, you'll never grow
Ahh, you'll never grow

(Bizzy)
Where your friends ain't your friends
And your foes ain't your foes
Where these niggas turning us bitches
And these bitches turn into hoes
Where the women at?
Baby I'ma getcha back, getcha back
Sit cha back, lick ya back, split ya back, picture that
If you don't know my story that's a more the reason to get the seasons
I'm stressed but I'm still breathing
Cleveland, the city we come from redrum
And murda mo I can feel some
Dumb idiots, hideous, fiesty, insideous
Some say I'm the prettiest thing
No need me rapping?
Fuck that!
Wind up just like a muskrat
Hut one! Hut two! And bust back!
Cuz that's just how we do in fact
How do I feel me?
Fuck that touch molest two
And what's that little lesion on me?
Jesus, why did I do that?

(x2)
You better be careful where you go
What am I supposed to do?
You better be careful what you do
What am I supposed to do?
You better be careful who you use
What am I supposed to do?
You better be careful who you choose
What am I supposed to do?

(Chorus)x4
Ahh, you'll never grow!
The army's on way

(Bizzy)
See, we can ride and fuck a cop
Oh no, let's walk and fuck 'em all
We can pull out all our guns
Or we can talk and help the cause
Silent weapons watch your step, step
Squad hit your set yet?
Ain't nobody snitching
But I see one of your niggas is itching
Soon as pinched 'em I connect he gonna tell 'em
I'm gonna tell you, you gon' get that ass wet, wet, wet
We talking about non-profit organizations
Travel with the Lord all over the nation
Unmasked situ-, love and trust have some patience
Keep the faith
Even if Satan is face to face then keep hittin
Remember Joe before value of gold broke, but I know
Whatever you facing keep on chasing, chasing
Can't runaway you gotta face 'em, erase 'em
Get to the finish get to the spinach, and keep blazing

You better be careful where you go
You better be careful what you do
You better be careful who you choose
You better be careful who you use
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?

(Chorus til fade)
Ahh, you'll never grow
Ahh,you'll never grow
The army's on way
You'll never grow
Ahh,you'll never grow
