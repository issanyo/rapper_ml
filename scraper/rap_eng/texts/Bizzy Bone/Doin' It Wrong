[Playa] Yeah, ha ha ha
[Playa] Yeah tell 'em what time it is
[Bizzy] Bone Bone Bone Bone - it's Playalitical (it's Playalitical)
[Bizzy] And Bizzy Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone {*echoes*}

[Chorus: Playalitical] + (Bizzy Bone)
They try to bang in the club
But they doin it wrong (it wrooooong)
They try to get gangsta with it
But they just don't know (don't know, don't know, they don't know)
They try to get gutter on record
But that shit ain't raw (ain't raw, ain't raw, ain't raw)
It's Playalitical and Bizzy Bone
And this here gon' blow (Bone Bone B-Bone Bone B-Bone Bone)

[Bizzy Bone]
We got 'em mad at us, but these bitches they should be glad for us
When I'm up in the forest with Goldilocks, eatin they porridge
Rockin that funky joint, drinkin Villa Maria
New Zealand save Yan Blanc, my mama mia
It's so many people in the world and then within the planet
Taken for granted and they lost up in they circle, damn it
One chance for unconditional love and it's real
I ain't poppin no pills, I'm just clockin the mil's
Walkin in Eden as we passin them heavenly trees
Tell them my name is Bryon, it's my lady she Eve
Do you believe, well it's awfully good cause we got God
Aiyyo bless Joe, as I get on my job
Still rockin, and yes we're solid as a rock, ya
Passin that sticky-icky to Bizzy, praisin Allah
That's God, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
The beginning of wisdom is to fear it

[Chorus]

[Playalitical]
If they had a pageant for hustlers I'd be wrapped in a ribbon
You can't pull my card boy, I'm street capitalism
At his peak turned into rap from maximum livin
C'mon mami, do somethin on my lap to the rhythm
I'm a suitcase exchanger, transaction arranger
Forklift breaker, these crates is gettin heavier
I don't gotta touch ya, see you or do one thing to ya
Knowin my status alone'll shake ya labia
Playalitical! And I'm known to make the beats man
Shoot, keep bouncin like that and you gon' get a beat rash
Cocaine white, suit on and my piece match
Plus my keys match, see I don't need ask
You with me now, this by far is a blessing
When we get to the car you should start undressing
You dance the way you do waitin for someone impressing
And I'm right behind you, check one-two, testing

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Why they lookin sad at us, what's wrong, they should be glad for us
While I'm walkin in the forest, we're gonna go a long way
Like in the chorus, phosphorus, smoke in the mirrors
And the picture's clearer, one God, always superior
Feelin us, one time, we in the studi-udi
Gettin it groovy, 70's style like moody-oody
Roll with a uzi, never readin how to use it
Make my money, smokin weed and drinkin liquor, sangin music
Hey, never abuse it, the consequences are serious
Just like my homie in Columbus, it's mysterious
Curiosity, it's comin in so ferocious
Expialidocious, deeper, with a psychosis - what?
Still rockin, and we're solid as a rock, ya
Passin that sticky-icky to Bizzy, praisin Allah
That's God, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
The beginning of wisdom is to fear it; one time

[Chorus]
