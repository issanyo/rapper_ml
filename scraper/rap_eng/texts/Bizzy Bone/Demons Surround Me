Demons surround me all the time

[Bizzy - repeat 2X]
Demons surround me all the time
Demons surround me all the time
Now pick up your psychic line
Now pick up your psychic line

[Bizzy]
Nobody believes
Nobody believes
Nobody believes me, even my baby girl
See I was raised up on that ouija in my crazy world
Better take it easy
[Sang] Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my brains, brains
7th Sign time, in a line, shine, fin to bye-bye, die die, bang bang
Hit 'em with that woo-woo, and that flip-flop flown-n-low
Steady as we roll
Maybe you don't know, oh
Get away for safety, in a coma like state, invade me
Everyone say: "Hey, hey, he's crazy"
Premonitions, keep pushin' daisies
Wait, they chase to slay me
Paranoid, mortal to the paranormal, jumpin' out portals
Kinetical energy formal in the global get warmer
Mormons may mourn, may Messiahs be born, torn in the purgatory
Sworn to violence, silence, word my bond
Get ya story on, call me, saw me in the army gatherin' in harmony
Hardly in all we be so salty

[Hook]
Demons surround me all the time
Demons surround me all the time
Now pick up your psychic line
Now pick up your psychic line

[Bizzy]
Talk to the walkin' dead, crossroads, call on the Rev., lost souls
And I'm off in a coffin' tossin' my memoirs, oh no
In the closet, come open the door, what do you see?
A funeral
Usually closest to kosher 'til I see some loved ones, don't go
Get it crucial, pick up the psychic line
Future to before time in the sinister mind of spiritual wicked
Intertwined with weak souls, come kick it
Written, rewind, get it, look out, hit it, rise
Dig it, wig out, feel it, ride
Mimic, die
Nigga, fly
Boom bye-bye
My kind in time, 7th Sign, 7th Sign (7th Sign)
Time after time get mine, gon' get mine
Pick up the phone line, pick up the phone line
Ready for truth on the loose?
Got a dime or two and I'm liable to tell you, only if you know, wooo
He flew right bye you, true
Demons follow and resume from the womb in the tomb
I fool you, boom, boom, boom
B-b-b-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
