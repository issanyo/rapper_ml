[Hook]
Let's just sit back and do nothing at all
Let's just smoke to the good life
Can we sit back and do nothing at all?
Can we smoke to the good life?

[Bridge]
I love this new wave that we on right now
Can we vibe, can we vibe
(X4)

And we smoooke (and we smoooke)
So let's blaze (do that thang)
And we toast (and we toast)
To that drank (to that drank)
We take shots (we take shots)
We true Kings (Lebron James)
We don't care (we don't care)
What you think (what you think)

[Chorus]
I'm on a wave, where I'm gonna stay (I'm gonna stay)
So can you stop fuckin' with me (stop fuckin' with me)
(X2)

[Layzie Bone]
Little Layzie feelin' all so wavy
Mind on my business as I ride for this daily
I ain't got time to recline that don't pay me
I feel my mind is a grind for my babies
Roll it up, smoke it up
You can feel it as I hit it like I rip it from the bong
Never trippin' on my zone
When I'm dippin' on my chrome
Represents the Bone strong all life loooong
Gimme the time, I can plot a new come up
One of a kind, you can watch but don't run up
Know I'm gon' shine just like the sun come up
No regrets, no apologies
Living through my melodyologies
Corner the market like a Monopoly
Give me a break with your hipocracy

[Bridge]
And we smoooke (and we smoooke)
So let's blaze (do that thang)
And we toast (and we toast)
To that drank (to that drank)
We take shots (we take shots)
We true Kings (Lebron James)
We don't care (we don't care)
What you think (what you think)

[Chorus]
I'm on a wave where I'm gonna stay (I'm gonna stay)
So can you stop fuckin' with me (stop fuckin' with me)
(X2)

[Bizzy Bone]
All for the ones that I ride for
Ones that I act for
One moment and I gotta go back ya'll
I could be any King again but it's one I got there waiting at the back door
Pack all your dough, roll with Bone
And it's on it's on
Where they click that chrome
And we go, we are, we home
Smokin' smokin' smokin' ready for the war when the war break open
For the moment frozen, zonin', car full of ecstasy, we rollin'
Henny and coke and I'm cloakin', coasting, toast to the ocean, locomotion
Hopin' this marijuana gets me through all the culture vultures

[Wish Bone]
I'm so high, I'm so high
Puff with my day one thugs
It's alright, get your high
Fuck it, all the way up
I'm leanin and leanin
My high to the ceiling
I'm so gone, its too strong, what?
Nigga that's Bone

[Chorus]
I'm in a wave where I'm gonna stay (I'm gonna stay)
So can you stop fuckin' with me (stop fuckin' with me)
(X2)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Since ya'll wanna have us a party
Then go ahead and pass that drink around
Here's some Henn, and you can have you some Bacardi
Tell them hoes over there, man it's going down
Tell the thots get their high tails over here now
They with it, we with it, let's get it, don't hold on
Pour me some drank up
Baby roll me some dank up
Hurry up and let's smoke up

[Chorus]
I'm on a wave where I'm gonna stay (I'm gonna stay)
So can you stop fuckin' with me (stop fuckin' with me)
(X2)
