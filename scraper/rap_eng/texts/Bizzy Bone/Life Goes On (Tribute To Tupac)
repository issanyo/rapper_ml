Mr shakur
Man
Your essence reamains pure
And by the freedom of god we got a sure shot
And jesus you been good 2 me
When lord stops, my life goes on and for sure mr shakur
N bless with your presence your essence remains pure
I never made it in school
In '92 lookin for a job as a parttime father,only if you knew
I put tha chronic through your music thats gettim me through itz 1999
Now what we gonnado?
