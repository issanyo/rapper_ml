[Bizzy Bone]
Hey, gimme some herbs, the word
Better hit it, we know, we know what you heard
Thai-da-da-da done hit my burb
Here to get it, hit it, and niggas is served
And a fifth of burb
It'll switch your nerves, and I'll get to swervin
Burnin in my Benz, and I'm here, nigga
Don't you ride with me, you have to learn it
Close the curtain, nigga, we searchin
Search for the blunts and stone, I'm certain
Runnin up, so I'll be runnin, and rappin's my hobby
When I'm smokin I'm working, and I'm hurtin, hurtin
Reefer, reefer, reefer, yes, me P.O.D.d-ah D.d-ah
Past overdose comatose, see a
See a bunch of sticky creeper, creeper
Roll it up, sellin my kin folk
And the end of the world, I'll have the indo, indo
And you can hook it up, need no friends though
See, little B.B gives no weed fees when your ends low
We can get smoked

[Hook]

[Bluelight]
(Hey!)About to curb serve over a phat tracks
Bluelight has got the scoop on where the party's at
Somebody said, "Damn, where's the drinks?"
Its chillin' in the middle of the kitchen sink
We got Alize, and Isle iced tea
A little Bambazini and some Hennessey
The stuff that keeps you toe-up
Now tell me are you high enough?

[Hook]

[Bizzy Bone]
Remember forever addicted, get it twisted
It's that mystic Rip and Guiness, hit it
Singin my business, lately, got me ready to kick it
But dig it, my hydro high-got me thinkin, "Die, die, die."
Twenty twin, twin, then again, no crime in a dime
Well did llelo to payroll, straight to the bank, oh, ever so thankful
My mayo, aiyyo, stay away or come and get split a wig, insane, oh
Gotta make that money, man, any and all cost, y'all
Any and all, all, nah, gonna get caught up, caught

[Bluelight]
The house was so hot, I can't stand the heat
I'm dancing with my peoples I've been tryin to see
There bumpin my jam, guess who I see
Comin to hype the party with some indo, tweed?
We got Bizzy Bone, Krayzie
Layzie, Wish, and Flesh, thugs-n-harmony
Righteous when I spike the punch
My people's gonna drink it up

[Hook]

[Hook:(Bluelight)]
You gotta puff, puff, give, and pass it to the left[3x]
