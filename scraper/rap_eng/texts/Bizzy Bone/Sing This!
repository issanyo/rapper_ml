[Intro: Bizzy Bone]

I see Stars, Bizzy Bone

[Verse 1: I See Stars]

Come on girl, you've got one shot to be with me
You know you drive me crazy
But I know how to take your breath away so lets go
Well I don't care what's going through you
You can see me, and I can see you
So lets cut this game, we both feel the same
And I'll show you a night you're used to

[Pre-Chorus]

All you do is run through my head
Are you getting tired yet?

[Chorus]

Everyone's jumping up and down
I'm starring at the crowd
While the dream girls singing the words
And she looks like she needs me
Dance with me and I'll show you what you're missing
And everybody in the town, put your hands up all around
And sing this, let's sing this

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]

Cautious, never been a burden with the bosses
Crosses, God says step up with the flow
With the dipper in my door
So saucey, running for months and my song say "woo"
Got my palm tree, I'm riding
That's right can't no bosses counter play me moves
Shoot the monsters
Party like it's 2009 up in the eye
Where they zone in﻿ the homeless
I See Stars, Little Bizzy Bone
No Shorts, No Losses
Scenes of adultery, resist the king
Queens of﻿ the fortress
Crystal ball warned us
I go rooting, there's one tonight
Give me four to the four to the beam
Kick 'em all in the foot
Play them all till they dead and Sing this
Then I bypass through the ash of my canva-see's?
Friend to me, bring the enemies
Spit it like I serve the fiends
Pussy was afraid of me?
The bastard would not come over with the thunder, raining﻿ dome bullet
I swear to the death till they park and they never forget
Henny had her hands on me, yeah I'm a motherfucker

Sing

Like a guillotine, caffienes what they give me
To kiss in the mist, with my lips in the distance
Me swerve every bump in the darkness

Stop

Sing to this, sing to this

[Chorus: I See Stars]

Everyone's jumping up and down
I'm starring at the crowd
While the dream girls singing the words
And she looks like she needs me
Dance with me and I'll show you what you're missing
And everybody in the town, put your hands up all around
And sing this, let's sing this

[Outro]

Everyone's jumping up and down
I'm starring at the crowd
While the dream girls singing the words
And she looks like she needs me
Dance with me and I'll show you what you're missing
And everybody in the town, put your hands up all around
And sing this, let's sing this
