Hey Mrs. in my business, wannabe publicist huh
Callin my people, tryin ta get info from her
I don't even know ya, can't even speak to ya heart
You are just a demon, can't even peep anyone
Miss computer hacker, you got no husband to love
Talkin about men and, shit you just need you a hug
You 57, tryin to hang with the young
You're the pagan woman, you just a girl in my world
Quit callin family, I'm?
You botherin my brother, yea brother Aeileon
Aeileon capone so sick of hearin your voice
That he puts you on mute and continues to grind with boys
Miss computer hacker, and mrs slacker in school ah
You, me and your teacher, I'm slappin you with my ruler
You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb
That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from
I hear you callin, we don't owe you no damn money
And all that whole crew I fired was done, cause they was phony
As we rise again, you can't?
It ain't no waltzin in, no matter complainin' or cryin'

Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'

Let me tell ya, supersize my fries
My sandwich is?
Gotta problem with my brother, don't you fuck with Q Loco
Smoke ya out of yo panties, and out of yo hose
And choke ya out of yo nooks and yo crannies and even the foes
Give em the swift blow, bizzy bone is my name
Allah, my master, I'm your slave, please keep me safe in this game
So as they run and try to sabotage our goal and our aim
Tryna defame and frame, but the real family remains
They call me insane?
Assalamulaikum keep them muslims on call
You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb
That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from

Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'

I can't even belch, now give me health and not welch
You don't understand my words cause you need help
Hey miss computer hacker, here goin slow for you
So my friends on the internet know that I'm still true
Bitch I am so cool
Why won't you test me and such
And if I was your friend I'd make you love me so much
But since I don't want nothin to do with you
You turn to a plot
And if you're makin money
It's funny you're tryin ta stop what I got
PUNK BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
PUNK BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
