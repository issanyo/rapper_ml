Falling falling so fast
Satan slithering in grass - there goes his ass
I will fight you in dreams
Baptized in your feces and angels cover my wings

Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go)
Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe)
I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road
I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know

Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll)
I drink a little when I'm thinkin sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly)
Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die)
I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go

Are we lawless and crass
Jason hither me to class - don't move so fast
Keep a life of my steam
My size and my meekness my weakness and my dream

Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go)
Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe)
I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road
I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know

Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll)
I drink a little when I'm thinkin sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly)
Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die)
I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go

Calling calling my dad
Seeping slowly and fast - Our balls are brass
I will light up and leave
Chastise with my species and angels cover my wings

Now I'm ready to roll - now I gotta suit up and I'm ready to go (ready to go)
Walk around with a mastermind - I walk blind with a nail in my toe (nail in my toe)
I get more than a fist could pull - so as the mountain got a squigly road
I light it up like it's the 4th of July - you motherfuckers just don't know

Last call for alcohol - we gon' roll now we ready to roll (ready to roll)
I drink a little when I'm thinkin sometimes - I just gotta let my feelings show (ready to fly)
Cause I'm so high I might just mess around and kiss the sky (ready to die)
I'm fallen down like I came to the earth - I light you up like the 4th of July - ready to go
