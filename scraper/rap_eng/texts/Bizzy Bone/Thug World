[Verse 1]
Better prepare, betta be ready for whatever
Little B still be gettin sturdy and eleventh in the ghetto
Down in Columbus I stay thuggish ruggish
Smashin the pedal, throwin up the seven
On these playa haters, blast the (?)
Little boy been poppin all the crude oil
Off in the ghetto we don't know nothin about it
Cause half of these brothers can't be loyal
Bitch you be sippin on hennesey, remember me
But I'm inside the twenty third century
Givin the best of me
Evidently this is real, but it don't barely feel
Let's do this studio grimey, quick 'fore I get killed
It's just a battle field, it's how it's going down
Everyone starts twistin' their tongues soon
As I come around, better watch your back
And don't be scared, youngster
This is the gangster party, and who me Bizzy the thugster
Call me Kamikaze, I won't even speak about Illuminati
Welcome to Babylon, hell, I need to speak to Tommy

[Hook]
Hey the world (the world) ain't yours

These last days you better prepare for war
You better prepare for war
Hey the world (the world) ain't yours

These last days you better prepare for war
You better prepare for war

[Verse 2]
Gotta get the drink and be thinkin she fin up in the car
Karlos Shamar Davis, 2-Pac, and Biggie Smalls
Eric Wright, one of the four fathers of gangster shhh
He one of the ones that got me in, y'all know what it is
One time for Left Eye, put your hands up
My little daughter really a makin me man up
Oh Lillian, I think I fallen down the steps 'bout a million
That's the way I'm feelin here
What about Bone Thugs, if you really wanna know
Gotta keep it movin, keep it goin, cause I ain't no ho
Cocked in the streets with them, bustin jack move
This game is all about business now let this track through
Slap boxed with the biggest brother and make the big boy fall
For y'all motherruckers, my foster brother got shot
In on of his eyes, I guess Jehovah ain't want Tracky to die
Come on

[Hook]
Hey the world (the world) ain't yours

You better prepare for war
Hey the world (the world) ain't yours

[Verse 3]
How dumb would I be if I sold her the (?)
Just because women'll swallow you
How dumb would I be if I hit you with battles
And niggas beggining the story, I've been in a trap
In Columbus Ohio, like smile now thug world
Drunk and I'm buck wild and if you done better enjoy the (???)

Y'all live about that keep on keepin on heh heh
Little B boy with a blemish off comin crack
