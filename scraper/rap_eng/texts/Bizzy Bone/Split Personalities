Rasu-(Bizzy Bone)-Intro-
Yeah, yeah. What's up Gambi? (What's up, lil' nigga?) This that nigga that I was tellin' you about, man (Who, this nigga here?) Yeah. (Bring this nigga to the meeting tonight) It's on. (We are gathered here today among soldiers, spiritual guiders, security enforcers, vocalists. Yeah...)
-Bizzy Bone-Chorus-
(We are...) Different personalities, soldiers at ease, at ease (I don't really want to but I'm gonna be ready for the endin')
-Bizzy Bone-
So it's on, you think you're 7th Sign material homeboy? Hell yeah. It's on. Hey, hey! Hey, hey!
If you want to call me, a nigga been nice, ice me up
The original hot boys, you're never gonna be like us (7th Sign) Hear the cop noise
Runnin' from the drug bust
Thuggish Ruggish, dope under the dumb bitch your momma wanna creep, give her a piece of this young dick
She always want to get it, but you was always around
You ready to come, bitch? It's on right now
Got sick to my stomach, I know she in a coffin in the parkin lot
I never covered another nigga's mother
But shit, I'm a man; I give a fuck about a fucker
With or without you nigga, pick my gun up
Shut up, dumpin' all over your body
The bullets was jumpin' I'm pumped as fuck here to surprise, (?) right now
Ain't nobody gettin' in the way, shoot everyone around me in the club and the crowd, double the crowd
Got these big niggas (Bitch) I'm holdin' 'em down, hoodie down, with the gangsta glare
We still St. Clair, niggas, up against the killas
Turn up the music loud
Big business, a nigga make money
Enough motivation, retaliation; Off to the ghetto
My niggas is on another level
Come young generation...
-Chorus-
-H.I.T.L.A.H. Capo-Confuscious-
Biography of a thugged out nigga too legit to quit
Been hectic since day one, was wanted as a juvenile for felonious felonys, hunted by police
Captain in the battlefield runnin' the streets nutty
Who want some beef? Ain't no pussy's here
Hop off my extremely large dick, you know what it is
Confucius simply ridiculous, have these top notch hoes, panties soakin' wet
Horny, askin' me if I want a blowjob
Erotic, flip, psychotic sometimes
Always on the grind, mashin' by ride
Mafia regime clique tight
Join in, act up, won't come out alive
Take precaution, Gambini Mob Boss
Don't cross some sodomized bitch niggas, let that be a lesson to anybody think about testin' Numbero Seven
Long live the faction
Homie, what's set you claim? And this games very dangerous, question, is he really ready?
