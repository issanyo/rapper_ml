[Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Burn my name on my stone (everything)
Then make sure you fire it up (fire it up, yeah)
Burn that shit right to my soul
Then make sure you fire it up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up (everything)
Burn that shit right to my soul
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul

[Verse 1: Ray J]
I fucked around with the devil
Shirt feelin' like metal
Inhale that smoke
Then off to the next level
Hoes, I don't really care for
Real niggas, I ride for
My niggas that's locked up
Money on the books for your survival
Standin' next to the taco
Cocaine in the Tahoe
Blood niggas on beast mode
Crip niggas from East Coast
Ridin' round with the devil
On to the next level
Light that shit up
And burn that shit right to my soul

[Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Burn my name on my stone (burn my name)
Then make sure you fire it up (fire it up, yeah)
Burn that shit right to my soul
Then make sure you fire it up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Light it up, light it up
I was the one that invited them
Fucked around and got bitches tipsy, yeah, them bottoms up (everything)
Yeah, I got too excited, bro
'Bout to start actin' funny on your ass
I reaper that G, all that Louis and Birkin
You wanted me to burn you, I did it on purpose
If it was your ass, get away with murder
Burnin' letters 'cause I'm writin' in cursive
Don't care if I'm right, nigga, fuck bein' perfect
In love with the Actavis, mixin' the Perc' (everything)
You know that I'm accurate, missin' a purpose
And I'ma look back on this shit 'cause you worth it
I'ma grow from my mistakes
I'ma grow from it and learn
The old me is all up and flyin'
Niggas smoke that OG, let it burn

[Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Burn my name on my stone (burn my name)
Then make sure you fire it up (fire it up, yeah)
Burn that shit right to my soul
Then make sure you fire it up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul

[Post-Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh, ooh
Yeah, let it burn, burn
Oh yeah, oh, ooh
Yeah, let it burn, burn

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Let it rain when I put 'em in a
When I put 'em in the game, when I murder them, mane
Got somebody that can put 'em in pain
When I sneak in the door, never heard 'em in pain
I'ma call you voodoo when I'm in that mood
And I murder insane
My name, written in blood all day
Yeah
I don't really wanna raise blaze
Don't pick up that vase, vase
She done wanted me to chase, chase
Every day that I wake and I bake and I shake that shit
Hate when I show all the fake that I see
When I break that rib, when I take that rib
And I make that rib, I don't think that take
Heard my name, take my pain
Take my brain, take my lane
They can name everything
I don't really wanna be a commodity
But it really don't bother me
'Cause honestly, no sign of me
My prodigy, is all I be
Uh, she's burning my name

[Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Burn my name on my stone (burn my name)
Then make sure you fire it up (fire it up, yeah)
Burn that shit right to my soul
Then make sure you fire it up
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul (oh yeah)
Fire it up, fire it up, fire it up
Burn that shit right to my soul

[Post-Chorus: Ray J & Chris Brown]
Oh yeah, oh, ooh
Yeah, let it burn, burn
Oh yeah, oh, ooh
Yeah, let it burn, burn
