She's sailin' me Readin' and then feelin' the big recital
I'm flippin' the television Watchin' the New Revival
So she don't think I only wanted her body For vile

But she called me a bitch, a coward, a fag of Things

Wanna tell you my story about the 12th of September
I never had a Woman that stick through the thick and thin
Don't make me bring my Baby momma, name up again
I promise to tell the truth, no matter how Much it hurts
You know that I can't hide from you boo you know I Am at work
I'm hittin' the dirt, could you help me take off my shirt
Don't worry 'bout my tattoos, baby I'm not a cur-few
But if I play The dog reliable German Shepherd
You only have to whistle while we Did it from the breakfast
My head is in the plate no hesitation for The da
Man I can't wait to get my Scooby Snack, boo I can't wait
