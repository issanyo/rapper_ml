BIZZY BONE REAL (FREESTYLE) LYRICS

Intro: Bizzy Bone (Chris Notez)
(Yeah I?m so real, real, real, real)
Driving on the motherfucking freeway and shit, you know what I?m saying?
70 motherfucking miles per motherfucking hour
You know I?ma reach it up to 75, this how we do it baby
Boy get much more motherfucking deeper
Man this the motherfucking reaper is hanging on your shoulders
I wanna give him a hug and tell him that I love him and I?m getting older
And life is getting colder but motherfucker?s words are getting bolder

Verse 1: Bizzy Bone
While I?m walking in the trenches of Cali
I?m feeling these motherfuckers wanna see me all fucked up in an alley
They wanna see me with no money, they really wanna see me hungry
But of course I?m gonna clean myself, I?m feeling lovely
As they walking through the matrix, don?t even say it
Homeless ain?t homeless nigga, they ain?t boneless
And don?t play it, ain?t no hatred
Motherfuckers don?t even know, don?t even say it
Give it back to these niggas, they don?t need no knowledge
Motherfuckers need to pay some homage
I ain?t even trying to take your ass to the ghetto or spiritual college
Cause these motherfuckers don?t know and leather squallas
I need a bomber so I can hang through the cold
So I can hang through the bold so I can hang with the old
Meaning the the ancients as they sitting over and watching
This is the way we do it, the time is ticking and its the clock

Chorus: Chris Notez (Bizzy Bone)
To heal (I?m a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I?ma blaze the weed, hit the drink
Baby that?s just me (I?m a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I?m so real, real, real, real
(x2)

Verse 2: Bizzy Bone (Chris Notez)
My battles, they be coming in dreams
And motherfuckers don?t know that I?m seeing through the seams
As I crease up the jeans and I buckle the belt
And I rock this motherfucker, it ain?t for myself
And I rock this motherfucker, it ain?t for my dealth
And I rock this motherfucker, it ain?t for my health
Cause Imma drink what I drink, Imma smoke what I smoke
If I die from the liver cancer, bitch I joke
I?m a real motherfucker till they kill me (Yeah I?m so real, real, real, real)
Thou shall never kill, this is how they grill me
This is how they gonna feel me, this is how they are awaken
And this is that, that awoke, they say ?BB you still smoking??
Course I need some chronic in my system
Motherfuckers won?t even fucking listen
Gotta get them when you get them, you ridding them when you rid them
If you listen then you listen if not what the fuck

Chorus: Chris Notez (Bizzy Bone)
To heal (I?m a real motherfucker till they kill me)
I?ma blaze the weed, hit the drink
Baby that?s just me (I?m a real motherfucker till they kill me)
Yeah I?m so real, real, real, real
(x2)

Outro: Bizzy Bone
One time for their motherfucking mind, most motherfucking definitely
Motherfuckers can?t even come up in this motherfucking garden
With no shit, flat out get the fuck outta here
World wanna know nothing, that?s why God put 9 percent of the brain
Take out that cerebellum for me mayne
They don?t need to know nothing, one time for they mind
Be easy on them cuz
