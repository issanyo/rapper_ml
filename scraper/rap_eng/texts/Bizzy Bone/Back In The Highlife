The moment of time, when we makin'.. like I'm feelin' it
Lovin' it, livin' it, rippin' it, flesh...
Rollin' a blunt, and knockin' it, and baby, I want it for real
Keepin' it moving as fast as I can with no physical father
The pressures of steel (the pressure of steel)
And everyday, and in everyway, tellin' me do what I do, and it's cool
Remember my homies, remember my friends, I'm not going to lie to you, thought they was cool
Roll to the club, a bottle of bub, talk about love
Remember the chill, went to the lord, and the heavenly father is all that I have for real
All that I need, all that I want, nobody can mirror me, baby you strained
I'd rather kick it with them anyway, I'd never be mad cause of Cane
It's not that I can't, but baby I ain't, remember the words, you'll never forget
Now treat yourself cause royalty riches and sinnin' and crippin and shit

Chorus
I'll be back in the high life again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
I'll be back in the high life again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)

I know what they do, I know where they go
I'm breakin' it down it's looking like snow
Heavenly father you gave me my life and I'm trying to live
The people like no, the people like who (who), the people like what (what)
The people like where (where), which way did he go?
People they know but they won't admit it, it's all good, this is a pro
Out of the lord everybody will lead it, thought I was lost but look what was found
The Heavenly Father picked me up when I was down
They want me to choose but thats not my role
I'm saying my prayers to better my soul
To better my spirit to better my life and all that I had you already know
Get it some money and give me some clothes and give me a place to rest my head
In the name of the father the son and the holy spirit, amen
I'm feeling the east the peace we still I'm feelin the real I'm feeling the chill
And baby relax and rest your neck and rest your back
Heavenly father I thank you for everything life is good and you're the greatest
You're the best I'll tell the rest through all my prayers
And Heavenly father I thank you for everything life is good and you're the greatest
You're the best I'll tell the rest through all my prayers, we back baby

Chorus
I'll be back in the high life again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
I'll be back in the high life again
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in
(You better believe it youre going to be praisin' the lord for sho)

Forever and ever and ever and ever my baby I need you to please stay
What do
We say? It's ok, we can go together away
I'll never forget I cherish the
Moment, I cherish the day
The beautiful grace that's bought me good and it's
Your grace baby (it's your grace baby)
Finally free, I really don't care, I've done enough to feel the flare
Leave everything for you and you do cause this ain't for me
I'll never free almighty (almighty baby, almighty baby) I'll never free almighty baby
Nothing between but this is real remember the stars though shalt not kill
But if you ever ever need me I'll be standing in the battlefield
Peace for me please we need it, I've been in the mean green patches and the scenery heaven we pray us into scenery
(what a beautiful baby) what a beautiful baby, man down ten thirty
Huh, B in distress even ham(?) gets love yes
The water is good like it should I never forget I praise your name
Heavenly father daddy, heavenly father daddy
