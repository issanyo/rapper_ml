When I first met you babe
I said oh my Lord
When I first met you baby
I said grab your sword
I didn't know what to think
What's wrong with your mind
I didn't know what to say
I'm a walk by
Cause fuck it I love you
Fuck it I need you
Said baby I do love you
Baby I do need you
Well like ion, eon, love and hate
I don't want the? that'll be my fate

Mama I wanna sing

Mama I wanna sing

The way that he loves you
How can I do, what he does
I'm not a fool
The way that he thinks
The way that he drinks
It's all the things that he does it makes me sing
I said you deep in love
But I can't be your son
I can't be the one
I can't your gun

Well fuck it I love you
Fuck it I need you
Said baby I do love you
Baby I do need you

It's like David, Solomon, and the rest up in the bible
If I get with this girl then I might go through a trial
Or tribulations
Ain't no hating
My secular speech
Has got them waiting
I love you
She said she hates you
She don't hate me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Well fuck it baby I love you
Praise God I do need
Hmm
And baby I do love you
Baby I do need you
I need, I need, I need (I need, I need)

What do, I need
What do, I need
What's up with those?
?
Let me tell you what it is
Ohh

Well fuck it baby I do love you
Fuck it baby I do need you
I said baby I do love you
Baby I do need you
Like a spirit need souls
