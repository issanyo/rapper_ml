Yeah
Some people wonder, ya know?
They say well, what have you learned?

And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
To your left, your right
Your left (March with me!)
To your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right (Ten-hut! Ten-hut!)
Your left, your right

(Hook)
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and words
And what have I learned?
It don't matter but nobody take a day here to concern
See the good in the ones that'll burn
And you'll never get all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to The Lord
Heavenly choir, now we are adjourned
Oh we are adjourned-journed-journed

(Verse 1)
In the temple cleanin the mental the evil that lurks
Comin up off of around the corner with dirty ass thoughts
Here's thirty seconds to start
They slither like worms
They jealous of purity, jealous of people in love
They plot on the woman, destroy the connection
They see that you happy, came in from the scrubs
I'm tellin you bruh
They down with the serpent, it get in they mind
Believe the people who witness The Christ
Look at my life, and now they blind
Nobody to find
They sellin they souls, without even knowing I'll catch 'em
Without definitions and give 'em renditions of scriptures and shit
I keep goin and goin but knowing is mine
I walk and I shine in the sublime, gotta ward off all the demons
Outta my thought, they thought come clog my conscience
I sit back and wake 'em, not literally thuggin
Just comin and clog up they mind
What have I learned?
What have I learned?

(Hook)
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and words
And what have I learned?
It don't matter but nobody take a day here to concern
See the good in the ones that'll burn
And you'll never get all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to The Lord
Heavenly choir, now we are adjourned
Oh we are adjourned-journed-journed

(Verse 2)
With a bounty on my head
And a county hold in my mind
Angels grippin my spine
Dear Lord, these are scandalous times
We livin in Revelation, nation against nation
Flood in the hood, on a boat like Haitian
Me and little brother, we are runnin for salvation
Every day comin to face temptation
Case in joint, at the base of the point
At the place with a Dutch and enjoy, little soulja boy
Ya better keep ya boys and no noise, no boys sendin in no toys
And runnin with stock, ya better watch the cops
Ya better get off the block
You mean to tell me that motherfuckas is still sellin rocks at the spot?
With a Glock, and a knot, da-da da-da-da, eyy
Who do you think you are?
Dead in the heart
Dead man walkin, man, don't need to start
A tear from the above, but we thuggin in the park
Another dog, she barked it
On the porch with a sawed-off shotgun, ready to spark
On the multitude (Is that all you got?)
Tryin'a shock the dude, get him in his heart
And laugh at him fast, like hen and a hog
Run into I, you better hold that stack
Weeded out, then baby even now
Poor child in the hood, no hood, no doubt, no wood, no hort, no hood, no shout
Ambu-lances, coroners, and some that never know no doors
Brain cartiladge up on that floor
It's one friend, please let me take it one most

(Hook)
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and words
And what have I learned?
It don't matter but nobody take a day here to concern
See the good in the ones that'll burn
And you'll never get all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to The Lord
Heavenly choir, now we are adjourned
Oh we are adjourned-journed-journed

(Verse 3)
Grind in the days in a maze
And amazed with the phase in the plague of a homeboy blazed
Now the homeboy slayed and the streets so crazed
Know that he prayed, that shit is played
It's ok, it's alright
Spirit'll be better when you see that light
When you see that flight
And Allah provide, perfections, let's go take a ride
Loadin' up clips, hollow tips
Ready for murder, swallow this
Follow this, model this
With death, you don't have to swallow shit
When it's bottled up and it tastes like piss
Ridin' on up, thumbs up and flip with a clip
Niggas off with the hurt and pain, but the hurt remains
Hurt remains

(Hook)
What have I learned?
Surrounded by nothing but snakes and words
And what have I learned?
It don't matter but nobody take a day here to concern
See the good in the ones that'll burn
And you'll never get all that you've earned
Don't interrupt me, I speak to The Lord
Heavenly choir, now we are adjourned
Oh we are adjourned-journed-journed

(March with me!)
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
To your left, your right
Your left, your right
And to your left, your right
Your left, your right
