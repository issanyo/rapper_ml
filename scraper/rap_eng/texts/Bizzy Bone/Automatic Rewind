[Evil Laugh]
[Evil voice:] Aye you! Tonight is our night, you ready?
[Bizzy: hysterical laugh] Crossroads? Ah-ha!
This is where Bone should've been... [hysterical laugh]

Now I got you screaming oh...
When you're down on you're knees
Is it joy? Is it love? (not sure on this line)
Just simply let yourself go... (go... go...)
? that's what we ?

I slip into ya
Glide yo lips around my rider baby
Your fingertips and make this trip
I'm a go inside
Exotic flexin
You ain't text'n me
You sext'n me and
?
You off the top
I'm a go behind

Play that fuckin' music
Let it automatically rewind
Panties drop
Slight shave
Coochie cleaned
I'm a pop
Don't stop
Won't stop
Best believe I can do this...

Cause I'm a rider baby (baby)
When I'm inside ya baby (baby)
Ya see that fire baby
So open up and I'm a ride it all the time...

Cause I'm a rider baby (baby)
When I'm inside ya baby (baby)
Ya see that fire baby
So open up and I could ride it all the time...

Now I got you screaming oh...
When you're down on you're knees
Is it joy? Is it love? (not sure on this line)
Just simply let yourself go... (go... go...)
? that's what we ? [x2]

Now reasons why ya got me
Uno, Dos (not sure on this line)
How she got me hot
Walk with it...
All the way that body body body
Just keep it movin' on em
Make sure it's satisfying
She say she freaky deaky
Gotta put men all inside it...

Play that fuckin' music
Let it automatically rewind
Panties drop
Slight shave
Coochie cleaned
I'm a pop
Don't stop
Won't stop
Best believe I can do this...

Cause I'm a rider baby (baby)
When I'm inside ya baby (baby)
Ya see that fire baby
So open up and I'm a ride it all the time...

Cause I'm a rider baby (baby)
When I'm inside ya baby (baby)
Ya see that fire baby
So open up and I could ride it all the time...

Now I got you screaming oh...
When you're down on you're knees
Is it joy? Is it love?
Just simply let yourself go... (go... go...)
? that's what we ? [x4]
