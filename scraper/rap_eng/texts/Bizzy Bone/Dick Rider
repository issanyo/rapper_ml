[Intro: Bizzy] + (Layzie)
Pour the shit
Some bullshit, this is some bullshit
(Anybody know where the Grey Goose at?)
Let's get this money man (c'mon)

[Hook: Layzie + Bizzy]
The dick riders, don't stop, swallow
Take it ya to your face, you ain't nothin but a hollow-point TIP
Tip's in your face bitch, tell that broad to follow, follow
Dick riders, don't stop, swallow swallow

The dick riders, don't stop, swallow
Take it ya to your face, you ain't nothin but a hollow-point TIP
Tip's in your face bitch, tell that broad to follow, follow
Dick riders, don't stop, swallow swallow

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Oh my God! The people love and hate
We are the mighty mighty warriors, plus the 7, hey!
Semi-automatic with a fully-loaded banana
Got my Benz full of my friends, puffin on tropicana
Promotin all the way in Atlanta
Got my homeboys off in a Chi club, Do or Die
With a pistol grip pump, I'mma laugh at all times
What ya think I just wanna grind? Motherfucker I'mma get mine
What do ya think that I wanna shine? Is you crazy as hell?
My shit is kind of inspiration, oh you want me to fail?
Well best believe that I won't judge y'all, I love y'all
You know the Feds been checkin up on Bizzy
And Bizzy he gon' sell drugs y'all
This is the hour where I'mma just show my testicles
Nigga with many skills, givin bitches the chills
This is the hour where I'mma just show the testicles
+Forever Young+, Layzie and Bizzy givin bitches the chills

[Interlude: Layzie Bone]
What'chu say muh'fucker, what you wan' do? {*3X*}
I ain't think they ain't sayin nothin nigga, bitch ass nigga!
Watch out bitch!

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
I'm slammin the do's on my Caddy Coupe
Crankin it up and smashin the gas
I really don't know where I'm headed dawg
But I'm leadin it hard, chasin this cash
Mobbin, through the grimey streets
Bendin them corners, takin them notes
And I know these folks is watchin me
So you know I gots to watch these folks
I'm playin for keeps off in this deadly gaaaame
Thuggin enough to get me some change
'til the day I die I'm down for my thang
I'm goin against the grain, after the rest I got the cheese
D-boys in the industry wanna break bread, you feelin me?
From Detroit to Minnesota, D.C., North Dakota
I'm kickin it when you see me dawg, I'm from Cleveland dawg, we rollers
The, #1 Assassin is, comin through the bitch blastin shit
Take what I want don't ask for shit, nigga I'll put the match on shit
You fuckin with a thoroughbred, pistol-totin hardhead
Killa, for the scrilla man, hittin you with that hot lead
Floatin with my afro blowin, rollin don't know where I'm goin
Layzie Bone just got another mil' and ain't nobody knowin

[Hook: Layzie + Bizzy]
The dick riders, don't stop, swallow
Take it ya to your face, you ain't nothin but a hollow-point TIP
Tip's in your face bitch, tell that broad to follow, follow
Dick riders, don't stop, swallow swallow

The dick riders, don't stop, swallow
Take it ya to your face, you ain't nothin but a hollow-point TIP
Tip's in your face bitch, tell that broad to follow, follow
Dick riders, don't stop, swallow swallow

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
My dick is the biggest so maybe that's the reason
These bitches just wantin to kiss it
They wishin they'd get it, comin out of they britches
But that ain't gon' happen cause that's for the Mrs
Schemin on riches and that in my character
Sayin I'm lyin but I better take care of ya
Me and my soldiers ain't never been scared of ya
Try it my nigga, I'm ready and I'm darin ya
Already ahead of ya, get it?
A-head of ya, nigga let go of ya genitals
Bang bang! Hit 'em up by the prison walls
Y'all niggas know Little Lay' got plenty flows
Y'all niggas like crabs in a bucket
Pull a nigga down if you get it, now don't ya
Hate to see a nigga on top of the pile
With a blunt and a smile gettin bread, now don't ya?
Now that's just causin warfare
It ends in bloody murder
I'mma bring it to yo' doorstep
With guns you ain't never heard of
Tec-9's and mini-macs
Seem silly? That's just my way of life
Don't think a nigga just be rappin about it
I be about it cause that's my life
Some niggas want money and fame
But damn that dawg, we want respect
O.G., double O.G., triple O.G
That's me when it comes to a check
I be talkin about a lot of shootin
Cause some of y'all niggas be prostitutin
Runnin around with my dick in they mouth
Like "Layzie, how you doin?"
