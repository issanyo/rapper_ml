[Intro: Bizzy]
(C'mon baby) Yeah, heh
You niggas can't hold me down, hold me down, hold me down (soldiers)
We're not fuckin around, fuckin around, fuckin round
You niggas can't hold me down, hold me down, hold me down (I'm baaaack)
We're not fuckin around, fuckin around, fuckin round
You niggas can't hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
We're not fuckin around, fuckin around, fuckin round
(You better tell 'em who the fuck I am)
You niggas can't hold me down, hold me down, hold me down
(You better tell 'em who the fuck I am)
We're not fuckin around

[Bizzy Bone]
You better tell 'em who the fuck I am, they see me comin around
I let 'em know we ain't fuckin around
I guess it's the mysterious
I read up on the scriptures of the end of the time, ready to die
With a serious sigh, it's a conspiracy
I'm feelin the vibe, 7th Sign niggas feelin my tribe
Cause it's the king, are you bitch-ified?
I better feed him with a spoon cause he's mystified
I heard him comin in the room from the other side
You wanna roll up on me slowly chop him down to my size
So have to try to the trinity - I think I'm on another fuckin planet
Got me rappin, I'm at NASA, I'm infinity
I'm focused on my mini-me - I better embrace the gifted
I got these washed-up rappers straight feelin me (yeah)
I really wanna be happy but this poverty is killin me
BAM! Let me tell them who the fuck I am

[Chorus 2X: Bambino]
Can't you see that it's meant to be?
You can, hate on me but you still can't, hold me down
Can't you see that we makin moves?
Got the grip and the groove and you know we don't, fuck around

[Bambino]
Bam was no one-hit wonder that gon' be gone by next summer
I'm gon' - stay at the top cause I done came from down under
See I'll - never forget the rats and roaches and pissy mattresses
And as - many days I had nothin to eat but saltine crackers
Shit I - thank God for Section 8, place to eat shit on hot plates
Cause it - sure made a cold beef bologna taste like hot steaks nigga
This ain't no joke, this ain't no fairytale, this real life
What you know about a clip in the window with no heat, feel like
I - come from the slums where the bums is like the role models
Sleep in the streets, beggin for change, clutchin a cold bottle
Shit, niggas fuck with death like it was thick bitch, with a fat ass
So you really ain't shit in the hood unless you got a {?} and you got cash
Don't you think you need to get this shit
Cause niggas in the hood respect the troop
I state it together and get the proof
And I go to the lab and I wreck the booth
Ain't no way you can stop the fire, runnin to you like a pump and a shot
Raising the bar with a {?} in the sky, from ghetto to ghetto you know that I

[Chorus]

[Bambino] + (Bizzy)
Don't fuck around, huh, yeah (you niggas can't hold me down)
Don't fuck around (hold me down, hold me dowwwwn)
Uh (we're not fuckin around, fuckin around, fuckin around)

[Chorus]

[Bambino]
Don't fuck around
