We's gon' be free one day...
Whoo! Aaron, don't let these voices take me away. (Help!)
We's gon' be free one day
(Shut up! Shut up!)
We gon' be free one day
(Quit talking to me!)
We's gon' be free one day
(Shut up!)

(Bizzy)
Man I can end it with one blast to the brain
What am I thinking?
Suicide could be better for me!
Damn, what am I drinking?
My nigga, that's henessey!
Factions of my body leak into a piece
Turning demons to giggling
Get him some Remy
Now I'm tweaking, ecstacy'd out every weekend
Well why don't you try some PCP?
But the weed was still decent
Aww, shit he's just about seasoned
My liver won't give it up
Your blood stream is immune
Ate up an ounce of toxic mushrooms
Here you need some orange juice
OJ! I hate him (you what?)
But fuck that and pop you one of these valiums I could
He's Satan desciple, he's coming to get you very soon
Satan desciples, he's coming to get you very soon
He can come in the form of drugs
He can come in the form of blood

(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Who me?! I'm the voice in your head
You're dead as a doorknob, doorknob, doorknob

(Bizzy)
Hey rejoice!
I know where we can get some napalm
My sister's baby's daddy's getting the bomb first
Did you hit up my babies' moms?
Now roll up another L!
I love it when niggas go out with a bang
Throw my thangs!
Naw baby, blow out his fucking brains!
I lit up a cigarette, look innocent cuz we're passing 4th District
Double Glock, stick it out that window ready to start some shit!
Hit that, trippin' out flippin' out, getting off, getting out
Fuck em!
Baby calm down, the law's right behind you
I'm a buck em, stop the car!
Turn around and bust em, it didn't even stop 'em
Gives a fuck about they backup, pop my trunk!
That's when they shot him
Shot him, shot him, shot him, shot him
Shot him, shot him, shot him, shot him
When they shot him
Shot him, shot him, shot him, shot him
Shot him, shot him, shot him, shot him
When they shot him
Who me? I'm the voice in your head
