Wake up, eat dirt, sleepwalk, breathe death
The devil is a bitch but he can suck my dick
Move your body weigh your chest, I'm blessed manifest
Yup That's just yeah my nigga's the shit
Mocha chocolate Gimme a mud slide
I flip my collar up, snake find his f*cking vibe
Follow me all day, bother my niggas too
Heaven belong to me, it don't belong to you
So where your breath at, and where your reps at
Cleptomaniac askin where the rest at
Where my killas reside A death by drive by
Murda is
I just wanna murder the bitch and afraid to die
Doing it all day, you going ask Paul
Hell yeah my nigga until Babylon fall
I see they real jealous, now paint my picture wait
Butt naked and you kaboom my dick in the lake
Flip this like Hannibal, bitch suck metal
Follow the temple of the temple till the shit settle
I gotta go baby, I drive the hoe crazy
Ask Layzie I'm a stone cold never shady
Wake up, eat dirt, sleepwalk, breathe death
The devil is a bitch but he can suck my dick
Move your body weigh your chest, I'm blessed manifest
Yup That's just yeah my nigga's the shit
Seven and crown royal dirty motel
County and no bail, flip flops and no sale
A seven headed dragon, many men come
I'm at the local bar ordering another one
Get off my dick devil, trying to get on the level
It's one shovel, baptized we don't have to pedle
That's a false name
Keep running on the
And my runaway
This is my real spittle This is my real life
And ain't never die, never paid the f*cking price
What's rice to Koreans and the plains cause
What's bombs and the killas of the flames huh
Real earthquake
Nigga be jealous
This is Jesus we'd tell ya and we are so valiant
We standing like torches I'm jumpin' of the portches
Warriors
Does Ciara have a penis, I hope it ain't true
If she do, I banana split may do
Rihanna's bruised up It makes me sicker than the flu
Man who I'm trying to fool, I'd hit the broad too
What made you do it Chris? I'm sending the question
I heard she's bangin' Jay-Z but that's her business
Whitney left Bobby I heard she get away
Still think he's the king of RnB
Wake up, eat dirt, sleepwalk, breathe death
The devil is a bitch but he can suck my dick
Move your body weigh your chest, I'm blessed, manifest
Yup That's just yeah my nigga's the shit (x2)
