[Intro]
The lion is back, JD
Bizzy the Kid (We back at 'em again my nigga)
Yeah yeah, diamonds in the back, back
Yeah yeah, diamonds in the back, back
Yeah yeah, diamonds in the back, back
Yeah yeah, diamonds in the back, back

[Verse 1: Jahni Denver]
I see my last name burned to flames when my sister was slain
Her ma-mom howled to the wind like a mother wolf who was maimed
And my dad was grizzly bear, but he cried like a cub
Our hearts sealed up with this hatred when they took who we loved
And I never would imagine, that I would be rapping
Eighteen I was jacking, next thing that would happen
Five years passed and didn't have a rash, gave me the passion
Asking, I'll be in the beat dancing
I'll be on the beat tapping
Straight safety and glover, same as me, lover
This is the life that I chose, turning rhymes into roads
Still pedals on the concrete, hope I've never got an army
Watch Biz with a bird's eye view
You can tell by the words I spew
Sick with it, and I'm only getting better
I'm a straight go-getter
I want a piece of the pie, sleep when I die, and my words live forever
I will never stop, like death I keep running
Straight to the top, my middle name is running
Give it all I got and now the time coming
Number one spot, I take the ship from him
Mountain lion inside of me, now they dying to sign him
I who eyeing the lion, may I keep rising and shining

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Put up a cover let me tell these muthafuckas
How to keep a nigga off of them, tell people run for cover
Nigga Bizzy with the double Z's, running with my nigga J Denver
We got another one to put up and they pulled up
And they stood up in they hood up on they own
Entering the room, give it up for niggas
That be deep up in the cut
The kind of nigga that'll spit above a muthafucka fore you give a bucket
Tell a brotha give a little, help a brotha if you wanna
If you're gonna on the corner of the alley
With a quarter back to Cali
Got my muthafucka take a tally
Take it to the mo-mo get the na-na
Ain't got nowhere to go, we got dough
In the middle of the rain
Rollin the medical I'mma take it to the brain
Never been ashamed, you know it ain't a thang
Tell me what the game?
Ghetto niggas leanin' all day
They don't really want the battle mentality
But on the real we aren't the niggas to battle B
I get the scrilla cuz I still got a battalion with me
But on the realla, we don't give 'em the credit to be
Up in the mass, with the brass, walls crash
When they clash, balls smash
With them wax walls
Better be crafty, bet a nigga be masking
And max on and max on
Wanna keep this bullshit classy, spit another 16 at them bastards
Finna get this crunk shit nasty
Get anotha whip cleaned and anotha whip cleaned
Bing bow to the masses
Smoke weed til I'm ravaged
JD hit a nigga in the mouth, so classless
Nigga fuck that's some wack shit
