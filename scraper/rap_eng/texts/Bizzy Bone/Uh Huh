Uh huh uh huh ain't nothin like money in a ziplock bag
Uh huh uh huh smash with the cash 2xs
I don't give a f*ck if you from cali
You don't wanna see me in a deep dark alley
In a row where the hood go you know
When we burn the clubs and get at it
Drunker than a yiddy mop splitty mop
See them in the club and we hit em with the big shit
Big enough for the wig split, big weed and big chips
Mo nuts, mo gunz, more heart, no love for them sharks momma
Hit em with the mini mack and its like that. Tell him bring on the drama,drama
Said its all about the karma, I don't know
But maybe if you digged inside you will find a reminder of all your life
Times is tough, and if your up then nuff said
I don't give a f*ck, I don't give a f*ck
Come along the way and ill be there when they all are gone
Said I would lay some more heat yeah yeah
Well then in this case well then I will say that beneath me my life is hard
Tell them I was destined with two heats in the book of psalms
Tell em I was destined with two heats in the book of psalms
