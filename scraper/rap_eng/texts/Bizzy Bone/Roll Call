[Bizzy 1]
It's a war goin' on here in this Universe
Ha, ha. And I spoke my mind, and it liberated me
Rap is truly back to it's original force

[Bizzy 2]
The weeping widow and the abominations
That is tatted on your forehead:
You will fall in the new born Babylon
Y'all don't feel me?
Get on the muthafuckin' level!
