[Intro: Bizzy]
Ha ha ha ha, and it's on
Once again it's on, Bizzy the Kid
The Midwest Cowboy, in the place to be
Holla at your boy
When I see-ee, I see-ee, who I be (who I be)
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
And it damn sure ain't gon' be no blasphemy man, holla at me

[Bizzy Bone]
The valley of death, go peak in the shadows
And gallop to gallow, the way that we ride
Probably think that it's over the other side
Baby divided go peek at the time
Reminded to open the people the blind, look at the duty
Don't think that I look at the booty
From everything that I was listenin
Rippin the tip of the dirty the mind
God, how could I know somethin?
You know that they tellin me I don't know nothin
They wanted the confident, competent never be pompous
The drama they given 'em dozen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
Feelin the love and the beauty is real
The beautiful field, remember thou shalt not kill
Whenever you need me it's never exceedin
The beautiful lessons and beautiful blessings
And daily distressin, not here to impress 'em
I'm guessin the expression is plain as steel
Look at the metal, the metal, the metal
Now let me go grab it before we collide
The rhetoric, never be hesitant
Never my love, the Lord provides

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I am what I am, no adultery
And who I be when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I
Now come in the light, up out of the darkness
When I see-ee, I see-ee, no adultery
Remember the judge is hard
Put up the cards no disregard

[Bizzy Bone]
Yeah, come in the light up out of the darkness
Fillin the void, and feelin my noise
And feelin the poise and feelin my boys
And feelin my voice and fillin my voids
Now come in the light, out of the darkness
Fillin the void and feelin the noise
And feelin the poise and feelin my boys
Now look at the temple the Philly
Look at him grow, look at the heart the mind the soul
We lovin the Lord, the Lord control
Get out of the knowledge
You know that the brain is just so slow
Plant the seeds, now all of the leaves
Remember the boss, remember believe
Remember the E, never no drugs
These liquid slugs, the love is from up above
No adultery callin me, baby we ain't fallin
Ain't know motherfuckin time for that
Now don't you abandon the rules, the rules is quickly focus
Say - all in, y'all in, all in, y'all in, y'all in
It's never the time to question, be attentive of the kindness
Never the blindness, when they find us spiritually fallin, and pausin
And brawlin, the birds keep on flyin, they're soarin
Whether it's - Saturn or Earth, God please prepare 'em (heh)

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I am what I am
Ain't no adultery-dultery-dultery
When I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am now
Ain't no adultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee
I am what I am

[Bizzy Bone]
Now flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Now look at the world, now look at the lust
I'm praisin the Lord in the name of the Father
The Son and the Holy Spirit plus
Flow with the movement, shakin the dust
Look at the world, and look at the lust
Praise the Lord in the name of the Father
The Son and the Holy Spirit plus
All of his saints, remember the war pain, givin the best we must
In the chastisement we must pay attention, that's what's up
So we tellin 'em baby to realize, the supreme almighty one
In the name of the Father, the Son
And the Holy Spirit they feelin the rush
They feelin the drum, feelin Cheribrums
Feelin the love of the Lord is just, plush
And all of his workings and the twurkings of us
Remember the humbleness, of course we love to play putt-putt
And plantin the seeds in us, I'm finna sacrifice the love and the price
And the pipe, even the ice, up up, it's time to shine
Anytime, give me some wine, hahaha
What a collision, plowin the brain until it listen, no reminiscin
Of course I'm pissin I'm feelin pissed, pull out the whip list
And I've been bitten to the crispiness, drippin in the (haha) blood
This is the way we do when we them thugs, now find some religious ones

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And when I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, no adultery
When I see-ee, I see-eeeeee
I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
No adulteryyyyy, when I see-ee
I see-ee

[Bizzy Bone]
It's like the covenant, Moses made
With the Lord, and valuable lessons
And valuable jewels and the valuable rules
Praise God for everything

Lean back chillin, everybody wheelin and dealin
I don't have to work or make a million, million
Say, lean back chillin, everybody wheelin and dealin
I don't have to work or make a million
When I see-ee, ain't no adulteryyyyyy
When I see-ee, who I beeeee (no adultery)
When I see-ee, ain't no adulteryyyyyy
When I see-ee, who I beeeee
