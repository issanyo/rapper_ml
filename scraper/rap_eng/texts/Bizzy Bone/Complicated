So - WHY YOU GOTTA GO AND MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?

[Kastro]
All of your life, all she wanted to be
Was somebody with a college degree
Swore up and down that you ain't need me
I used to tell you all the time that it ain't easy
Puppy love's what we had in the past
Now you a lady and you full of pizzazz
You tell me that I'm crazy and my life won't last
I'm gettin cash comin out my ass
I got game, I can't change, I swear
All I love is my family and beer (beer)
Most niggas is square
But my mind ain't designed to care (that's right nigga)

[E.D.I. Amin]
Now you can move slow, or you could shake it fast
It don't matter girl, go on and bounce your ass
See I'm a boss playa, just like my big homies
Addicted to money with weed with the cig' on it
Now you ain't a dimepiece (nope) but you's a strong lady (yeah)
Your ass is think, lookin sweet like a prom date
But I ain't the prom king, bitch I'm the prom fiend
E.D.I. the crunk king, c'mon, do your thing

[Chorus Two]
Just rock with me baby
Instead of walkin around, come cool with me baby
Instead of havin your doubts, come drink with me baby
So - WHY YOU GOTTA GO AND MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?

[Chorus One]

[Layzie Bone]
I'm a thug and he a thug, be showin love to the Thug Brothers
In the streets or in the club we some cool muh'fuckers
Come and kick it with me shorty, we tryna get to know you
Don't need anything cause my clique is wide, we bonafied soldiers
Dance floor is where I met her, Sean Paul was in the speakers
Twistin the hips and doin that reggae shit, damn I wanted to freak her
But instead I played it mellow, like "How you doin? Hello" (what's up girl)
If you ain't got no fella, let me take you to that other level
And she was wit it, wit it; I'm talkin about off the hinges
Grey Goose and Hennessy, this bitch was Dennis Menace
Pullin my sleeve and I'm like, "Damn baby, hold on
You fuckin up the Phat Farm suit, bitch roll on"
You complicate my pimpin hand, can't you see I'm a simple man? (L-Burna)
You fuck around and wear a brick, from the Timberland's
Situation went fine, baby way passed faded
So (WHY YOU GOTTA GO AND MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?)
Silly motherfuckers!

[Chorus Two] + [Chorus One]

[Layzie Bone]
Now, I got game, mo' game
Sit back and watch the movie, let it play
We do the same ol' shit every day
Get high, and watch the paper stack; now can you handle that?

Yeah, Bone Thugs, yeah, Outlawz
Uh, Deenucka, Self Service Entertainment
Deuce-double-oh-fo', Thug niggas..
(WHY YOU GOTTA GO AND MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?)
Don't give these bitches the time of day when they around here actin up
And actin like they don't know the motherfuckin program
Bitch beat it, we not on that bullshit
This real thug shit, real soldiers, respect us like that
Cause we will smack the shit out you, ha ha, motherfuckers
Yeah, yeah, Layzie Bone y'all
