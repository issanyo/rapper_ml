Mmm-hmm, Mr. Shakur, man, your essence remains pure

[Hook]
And by the freedom of God, we got a sure shot, and Jesus, you've been good to me
When it all stops, my life goes on for sure, Mr. Shakur and blessed with your
Presence, your essence remains pure

[Verse 1]
I never made it in school in '92, looking for a job as a part-time father, only
If you knew Pac, with the chronic through your music was getting me through, it's 1999
Now, what we gone do, huh, ya oh! enemies snicker when I pour out a
Little liquor, better not blaspheme your name and make you out to be the sinner
Who spent the holiday with that ghetto, cooking a hood dinner, writing my memoirs
Right next to your picture, remember: Life Goes On, that's what you told me
Homie, and Sylk-E-Fine hooked it up in the nick of time you know me-shit, I may be
Lonely and I talk to you, I hope you listening and we mob through you, we all miss
Him, and mommy say hey, she feed the babies, Johnny J still crazy as hell
Taking your class in college, hope I don't fail, I wish I had the mail for the
Million dollar bill, but that'd be too much like writing the whole situation
And it smells kind of fishy to me, bring the demons to the light, the truth-it
Might set me free, but they can't kill you twice, by the freedom of God we have
A sure shot, and Jesus you have been so good to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, my friends ain't feeling me, tobacco companies make money off of killing me
We been waiting for forty acres like we said it, damn, and the earthquakes with
The world's retaliation, all the abomination, call it 'El Nino', but it feels
Like revelation, huh, and Pac they got to you, you don't think I think a fan shot
You, they was jealous of your jewellery, and the jury thought they got you, I
Fast, prepare for the rapture with a blast for the ghetto bastards, walk in the
Wilderness with God given talent for ashes, pass the pastor, he ain't helping
The hood like judges should, but life goes on, it's all good, and homie we
Fight for wood, to keep us stupid huh, and after Eazy, it ain't no more
Ruthless acoustics, same producers seduce us, with jewels to boost us, before
We prove em wrong, kinda revolutionary to move us, but life goes on
Within the music and the song, it's abusive if you use it to fuel your fire
Huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Supporting my people, distorting my people, they calling my people, evil is finders keepers losers weep
The reaper, all you G's now, proposition 187, and you think we sleep now, how
In the new millennium could we smile, God loves the underdog, and of course the
Ghettos are close, just when the rain falls, reminisce on tattoos, the oceans
Pain y'all, note here for the dosage of prozac he prescribed, there's too much
Melanin in my system, musical group, we won't die, and what's the meaning of
Survival, knowledge of wealth is right there in your bible look at the literal
And learn yourself, pass me the lighter when I'm stressing on these issues, did
I mention my momma gonna need some tissue when they get you, I continue to flow
Eternal, remember Mo Murda way back in the day, smoking burners with lil Layzie
Man we shooting at the turtle, him and his big boyz dogging me out, I'm all alone
With my Thuggish Ruggish shirt on, but still many, I don't hate you, we black
And strong, even though I know right where you live, I forgive you and life goes on

[Hook]
