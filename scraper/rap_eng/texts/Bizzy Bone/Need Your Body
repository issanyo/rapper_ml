[Hook]
If you ever wanna meet someone
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
Need your body, oh baby, need your body
Oh, darling

If you ever wanna meet someone
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
Need your body, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Now I done been around the planet met plenty women but I never met one like you, you soothe me
Ooh, nobody can do me like you do we
Hang out we get high, you roll my blunts up for me
I'm feelin' you, girl, but I know we just homie
But your the kind of girl, that'll make a nigga wanna be down
The type of girl I need to be around
Not like them other groupy bitches on my dick for money
I could see it in your eyes, your shit is genuine
And me and you been together, whatever
But if your lookin' for a chill nigga hook up with a real nigga
It's guaranteed that if you fuck with Kray
Y'all never ever wanna go away
So if your lookin' for a nigga that can hit it and stay in it
Never quit it make you feel it when I split it I'm a dinner guinea
And you'll be happy with a thug like me, them toughs don't love like me
Girl, they can't fuck like me, like me

[Hook]
If you ever wanna meet someone

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
Hey, pretty lady I've been thinkin' about you constantly
The way you put it on me girl you really did drop the bomb on me
You's a freak and I'm a freak and I'm thinkin' this how it's supposed to be
It's already been written, girl, 'posed to be here close to me
Come on and close up with me, you the realest, illest picture perfect
Woman that I ever done seen before, promise to make it worth it
You deserve it, my purpose is to satisfy your every need
Satisfy you mentally, especially sexually
Nothin' but the best from me, come on and enjoy
The ride, I keep it strong all night long I'm a make you mine
You wanna take your time, and I respect your pimpin'
You workin' hard you, independent tryin' to earn a livin'
And I'm tryin' to beat the system, but I know you dig a thug
Your cup of lovers lookin' empty let me fill it up
Is it really worth I really wanna thug
And I need your body, I can't get enough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Candlelit dinners, expensive dishes, I'm thuggish ruggish
The definition of ballin' while dippin' in Columbus
Spit game like holy water in my saliva
The taste of your tongue come let me set your neck on fire
Smokin' chronic and swishers I am your ex-peal
Your body's beautiful, everybody feel you for real
Watchin' movies and fuckin' close to the sliding door
I want you to cum with the thunder, then do it once more
I gotta be real, you love me 'cause I'm such a gangsta
I'm willing to take chances, ghetto kid like Jo-Jo Dancer
Do you really want the handsome while you and your man are still beepin'?
You're thinkin' about me and he's thinkin' of kickin' it on the weekend
Always be my damn, always be my broad
No matter how much you fuck 'em you'll always be my dog
So let me hit it from the back one more time
Just for old time, slap on a magnum and go for mine
For mine, hey

[Hook]
If you ever wanna meet someone

Oh, darling

If you ever wanna meet some one
I forever wanna be the only one, in your life
I need your body, yeah, yeah, yeah, I need your body
