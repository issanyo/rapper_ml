Bizzy & (Cat Cody)
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway
(She's ridin' on the highway)
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway
(She's ridin' on the highway)
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway
(She's ridin' on the highway)
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway

(Bizzy)
Tellin' me to be careful

(Cat Cody)
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,zoom

(Bizzy)
Tellin' me to be carful though so dangerous
I say let's change it
Put on your coat and call up the chauffer
Oh, gotta leave the babies
Face-to-face it's goin' down
Baby lace it with some basment as (just a little)
Just a little temptation, and bury it underground
And make ya nigga feel famous and say "Hey, fuck the pages"
Off to the freeway, anxious to play
(Damn) Baby protect my health and yourself and everyone else
And lady respect my patience from temptations
Let off all that frustration, all is well, hell, what are you waitng for?
Basic relations waitin', wakin' up in the storm

[Bizzy - 8X]
Roll with me
Roll, can't you come over?

[Cat Cody - 2X]
Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway?
Have you ever met your lover on the highway? Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Bizzy)
When I Put you in my car (Zoom, zoom) move far
We chose to lose time and, my, why there you are
When I saw that night, I had to call
It's gotta be right, it couldn't be wrong
Lookin' in far fallen and gone, lookin' at the stars, all of them, long
And on the freeway, baby believe me, gotta take it easy
Yet appeasin' to please 'em
Oh, Jesus, she's breathin' on me!
But I ain't that weak to put her to sleep
So respectful, respect your temple, subliminal
Probably pause in the distance, reminisce visual, member da car

[Bizzy - 12X]
Roll with me
Roll, can't you come over?

[Cat Cody - 2X]
Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway?
Have you ever met your lover on the highway? Ah, ah, ah, ah

(Bizzy)
We're peekin' each other's secrets (Shhh)
No speakin', just heavy breathin'
(Why don't you take a ride with me? C'mon)

(Cat Cody)
Friday!

(Bizzy)
Friday evenin' clear through the weekend we're peakin' each others secrets
No speakin', just heavy breathin'
A quarter inch from your cleavage
The reason you got me
Teasin'--be gentle
Interested sexual in a room to touch you eventual, too much potential
Lookin' at you sensual
Let you go, roll, have your space
And I'll be paper chasin' up and down, straight ghetto facing
And have you ever fell in love
Just as much
That you forgot about everyone just for their touch?

[Bizzy - 8X]
Roll with me
Roll, can't you come over?

(Cat Cody)
Just for that touch
Roll, come on and roll with me
Stroll, come on and stroll with me
Girl, can't you come over?
Stroll with me?
Yea, you can
Yea, you can go with me
Yea, I know you can
C'mon, yea you can
I know you can
Just ride with me
