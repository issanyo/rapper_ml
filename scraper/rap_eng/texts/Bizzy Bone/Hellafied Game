No more passion when he was mashing'
Could my people really be laughing
Paying attention to what he was saying to keep from crashing

I was thinking of I could put in words to match em'
I watch em' look at the thievery stealing
My ???? will always catch him

Never the one to dodge/
Ever against all the odds/
Standing alone in a spiritual form/
I rather be my dammy dawg/
Rather be my family and im not lying just to be looked upon
It's someone singing another song
Specifically getting mah weakness on/
Women be right beside me plotting/
Nobody wants to sidekick/
Cool when they first met you/
Now they want the respect that I get/
Screaming we need to be going though stuff together so we can vibe with/
Whatever get off that dumb shit/
You need to be paying more attention to this/
What am im mad/ little im pissed considered it/
While im puffing on tropical im trying to be logical/
And I got these people trying to hinder me positive negative
It needs to be an obstacle give me progress im feeling hollow allowing me time to swallow
My enemies' time to talk I open his eyes so he can see
He talking in front of a wall
He talking he want to be me
He walking want to be a rapper, and an actor, and then write a book
Mah people in it and plus my equal he ???? and he got the look

Now that we made it and all of the rappers are keeping it real/
They'll never take me alive/
Im a rap till be killed maneuver the benz they see me ??? ??? ?? seventy-one on my way to Westville follow me all around the field/
Mumbling hunger pain, spinning the wheel/
Somebody right beside me wanting a record deal/
