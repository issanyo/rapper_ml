[Bizzy Bone]

You know we gotta have a weed song!

Ooh

Well they always got a weed song, luv it when my families high/
I know a few of you got issues cuz evils been out to get you/
Keep the family tight/
Light up the reefah for a stay over, family ties/

When i die we gon make some dolla dollas/
Well enough to holla holla/
Been smokin marijuana wit my bitchez/
Smokin marijuana wita my mama mama/

Livin off cleveland ??? for life/
Livin off weed and vibes/
Straight ??? niggas/
Wit seasoned and stress givin em chop ya ???/

Hey, Dont put it on me dont put it on me, look at me, im high/
I got some money i can let the shit dry/
If its sticky then its sticky oooh i/
Sore eyes, she gets me let me see it up under the bar/

[Chorus]
Get Money!, Pass the reefer smoke it too
Its Lovely!, Wake up the 1st thing that i do
Get Money!, and spread it all amongst my crew
Oooooooooh

Get Money!, Pass the reefer smoke it too
Its Lovely!, Wake up the 1st thing that i do
Get Money!, Get Money!, Get Money!
Get Money!, Get Money!

[Prince Rasu]
Scavangers watch me all times, when i won't feel like a million bucks/
They say ??? fuck wit me, i tie ya children up/
Reguardless of courtcases and they charges/
Im bumpin off hennessey nautious, ridin shotty in hot impalas/

Rock a jersey, dippin like a derby, gets up ya style/
Freak ill black em out laced wit the flame james brown/
Sippin on cuppacino, like carlito and gambino/
Schemin on a freedo big chips to whip benzino/

Challenge i say no, obstacles gon have to get hurtled/
Baby im out to collar for dollaz, niggas i hurt you/
Won't reimburse you, except wit shots that'll hurt you/
Glocks that'll murk you, shoulda never crept after curfew/

Im untouchable, similar to scarface/
??? of pacino be in yo kilos like star space/
Enterprise on a mission to go, where no man has gone b'fo'/
Wit clean getaways to mexico/

Plush rides, cuban carrots i gota find/
Life is a gamble, roll the dice, they never lie/
My niggas high, splittin vegas smokin incredible/
Sweakin like earl manigo baby its understandable/

Im droppin techs, fresh out the joint and still on a short chain/
Nigga when im off ima purchase a pound n blow my brain/

[Capo Confuscious]
Addicted Pothead, consumin pounds of sticky, pass it around/
Have the entire crowd lifted like cheech and chong/
Up in smoke, blown away, gazin trippin off shroomies/
Hallucinatin amongst ??? settle for goofy ass/

Ever since then drug substance straight blaze the weed/
Contemplate money schemes, currency value increase/
Gorillas get sorted when they see a brother flossin his brand new lexo land cruiser/
And they still leasin a 2 door honda accord (oh lord)/

Resident neighbours scared, terrorise the suburbs/
Freaky parties in til 5 o clock in the mornin, early crack of dawn/
Kick every bitch out my house, say pussy come pussy go/
Spend quality time, faithful to mary jane/

Lifted always stay high/
Soon as my chronic supply run low/
Back to the weed spot purchase sum mo, lets go/

[Chorus]
Get Money!, Pass the reefer smoke it too
Its Lovely!, Wake up the 1st thing that i do
Get Money!, and spread it all amongst my crew
Oooooooooh

Get Money!, Pass the reefer smoke it too
Its Lovely!, Wake up the 1st thing that i do
Get Money!, Get Money!, Get Money!
Get Money!, Get Money!
