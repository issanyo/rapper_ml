She want that thuggish, ruggish, turnt up in the function
Shake it for the love of the money
I give her that thug love, I do my stuff

Everything 100, everything 100, everything 100

[Krayzie Bone]
You know I keep it true to my grave
Girl, I always stay 100, I kept it real for 20 years, I ain’t changed
Be careful when you cruising in my lane
Watch me creep out through your rearview as I gas right past these lames
We did it how we did it ‘cause we did it for the money
Living on, living this, you really, really love this
You want a thug nigga like me
Yeah, you know they all love niggas like me

[Layzie Bone]
She ain’t complaining mainly ‘cause everything I do is entertaining
Hangin', swangin' body banging, she in training to be famous
Yeah, she speak the language, baby know just where the lane is
She with me, she’d never play with stranger, know we armed and dangerous
This ain’t your deal, this still the thugs but this for them players
This for the ones that’s putting the smoke up in the air
Everything 100 baby, this St. Clair

She see I lost weight, now she wanna see the stomach
Her bubble skill love it, women are here fucking
Let’s make it, get it, ‘fore we dove into the sea, touching

Because the ghetto’s in me, true niggas still thugging
She in the tub, in my cell …

[Flesh-n-Bone]
We got your lady stuck on a thug, say she want that love from me
Busters don’t know what to do with it, come let her have some
I tell her shut up and the soon I take this game
Then rub her down, head to toe, and whip her up with that thing
Ima get down foe mine, sure thing it’s borderline in crime
But I’m doing fine and that’s why I’m they valentine
I do it, do it two times
Until she scratch me now she hitting licks
Calling me papi
