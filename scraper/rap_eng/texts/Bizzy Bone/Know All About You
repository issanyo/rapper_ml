So now when I talk bout u can't even remember your name

Cause all these playa haters lookin the same
Nigga

I took took a picture
With the quickness I come get witcha niggas stop your ticka

Read description [? ]dismiss it and forgive it forgot your bid[? ]

I don't know you I don't know u a little crip forgettah
Like u never existed in my picture take it to you

It's like a nigga never knew you
My homies they wanna do ya
I'm holdin em back from screwin you

You wanna be me
In my bidness you wanna be a rapper you ain't [? ]cappo[? ] you ain't bizzy and you ain't [? ]tappa[? ]

Allahs god allahs my mastah
Create a fly
U ain't fly
You would shoot me in the back like brother ty it's only I

Who tried and get you off the cold... crack focus your mind and made you wanna go rap
How could you do me like that

And I still gotta forgive got a clean heart
Prosperus as I live
And now you know the truth

Do what you do without me you ain't gangstah ain't gangin ain't gankin a chin

I know all about you
[? ]I made you got what you now[? ]
And now u talking fast actin like u something u not
So now when I talk bout u can't even remember your name

Cause all these playa haters lookin the same

U wanna start somethin, you ain't even muslim

Wastin my time with your wack rhymes and you bluffin
Your homies are fruity so I question if they even like coochi

What ever happened to the pimpin that you said you was doin
Got your people gooey
Ain't never seen me before

Man they don't never boo me
Never confuse me or
Strangle my mind like I'm blind
And you hoes can't find

Look at you jealous of my fellas I'm a chillin proclime

You a dime you a boy you a toy indeed you got no joy so you make prank calls to me

What you see is the real ** feel no brag
I don't care bout your choices but I'm just not a fag

See I know all about you
[? ]I made you got what you now[? ]
And now u talking fast actin like u something u not
So now when I talk bout u can't even remember your name

Every playa hata lookin the same

So mr crackhead
Ecstasy poppin wannabe
Mr cokesniffah
Cocklicker
Wannabe alicia keyes
I'm a rocknrolla

Holder of the heart of a G
And I promise u can never be me
Only for tryin

Too expensive to buyin
Too estensive to [? ]say it[? ]
Artificial feelin of drugs can't even fly with it

So come and try it
You don't stand a chance in here
It's your weakness in your lust that done make you a queer

I'm on every tear
With every tear I give
They are not for you
Only for god I live

See allahs god muhammed is messenger may peace be a part of my lord and master help me say a [? ]postportum[? ]

See I know all about you
[? ]I made you got what you now[? ]
And now u talking fast actin like u something u not
So now when I talk bout u can't even remember your name

Every playa hata lookin the same

Hollah back

And now u talking fast actin like u something u not
So now when I talk bout u can't even remember your name

Cause every playa hata lookin the same

One time

[Q loco:]
I know you a bitch niggas from junk street
You can't deny my street tactics now police follow me

You played that [? ] two pieces now a nigga come see me
Switch the game up and now niggas they wanna be me

Too much leadership to play that backburnah
Military mind in motherfucker like I'm nat turner

Gotta watch myself *** a con cause u talks alot
I was openin up your prep but your rhymes ain't high

Hali is your ghostwriter I won't tell
All moneys pay good nigga see me in hell

Spit shells on my duels shine in the reverends form
Put me on a track with bizzy and nigga we do you one

Allah please let me apologise in advance
These niggas they made me do it give me one more chance

Return my pistol to my pants
And I stepped out true
I tell it was it is motherfucker cause I know all about YOU
