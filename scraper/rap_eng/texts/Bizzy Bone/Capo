{*gun cocks then is fired*}

[Capo Confucious]
Waitin on the bail bondsman sittin in the county jail
Question my intuition, "What have I gotten myself into this time?"
One of those situations change your whole outlook on life
Despite the hardships, we shall overcome, victorious
7th Sign Regime, the most notorious
Thugs you ever seen, holdin the lead, follow me my nigga as we ride
Front, back and side to side
Ladies jockin, keep on bobbin your head
Like the way we rock it? Yeah, bitch! {*echoes*}

{*sirens fade out*}
