Hey Mrs. in my business, wannabe publicist huh
Callin' my people, tryin' ta get info from her
I don't even know ya, can't even speak to ya heart
You are just a demon, can't even peep anyone
Aye Miss computer hacker, you got no husband to love
Talkin' an inch a minute, shit you just need you a hug
You 57, tryin' to hang with the young
Aye little pagan woman, you just a girl in my world
Quit callin' family, I'm on my?
You botherin' my brother, yea brother Aeileon
Aeileon Capone so sick of hearin' your voice
That he put you on mute and continues to grind with boys
Hey Miss computer hacker, hey Mrs. Slacker in school ah
You, me and your teacher, I'm slappin you with my ruler
You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb
That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from
I hear you callin', we don't owe you no damn money
And all the whole crew I fired was done, cause they was phony
As we rise again, you can't?
It ain't no waltzin' in, no matter complainin' or cryin'

Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' with it
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' with ya
To the block, to to the block, we goin'
To the block, to to the block, we goin'
To the block, to to the block
Yea that's what I'm talkin' 'bout

Let me tell ya, supersize my fries
My sandwich is?
Gotta problem with my brother, don't you fuck with Q Loco
Smoke ya out of yo panties, and out of yo hose
And choke ya out of yo nooks and yo crannies and even the foes
Give'em the swift blow, Bizzy Bone is my name
Allah, my master, I'm your slave, please keep me safe in this game
So as they run and tryna sabotage our goal and our aim
Tryna defame and frame, but the real family remains
You can call me insane, a whole notha ? on y'all
Assalamulaikum keep them Muslims on call
You can never fool us, and never do us so dumb
That we believe in you, you know where we come from, come from

Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' with it
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
To the top, to to the top, we goin'
Baby let me tell ya just exactly where we goin' with it
To the block, to to the block, we goin'
To the block, to to the block, we goin'
To the block, to to the block
Yea that's what I'm talkin' 'bout

I can't even belch, now give me milk and not welch
You don't understand my words cause you need help
Hey Miss Computer Hacker, here go a song for you
So my friends on the internet know that I'm still true
Bitch I am so cool
Why would you test me and such
And if I was your friend I'd make you love me so much
But since I don't want nothin' to do with you
You turn to a plot
And if you're makin' money
It's funny you're tryin ta stop what I got
PUNK BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
PUNK BITCH! BITCH! BITCH! BITCH!
