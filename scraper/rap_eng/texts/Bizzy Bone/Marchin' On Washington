(Gunfire & Explosions Sound)

(Bizzy Speaking)
It's time to give up the ghost. (Yo, what the fuck is this nigga)?
Give up the ghost. (Shit, niggas can't even get it on nowadays)
Niggas probably think we crazy up in this motherfucker, ha ha ha
I got my mob up in this motherfucker. (My cousins fightin cousins)
Oh and they ready for war
Let me hear my regime, make some motherfucking noise
It's a war going on in the universe against good and evil
(Crowd Roars)
Niggas don't give a fuck out here, boy
It's a war going on out here, you ain't knowing
Can I smoke, smoke? Can I smoke?
I tell you, it's a war going on out here
It's good and evil man
That's my camouflage, motherfucker
You boys is off the hook

(Bizzy Rapping)
It's a war going on and my dogs is raw
Nigga look in your rearview and tell me what you saw
I see this bulletproof nigga with his hand on his gun
I said nigga, you push the gas and somebody run
We all scatter from the chit chat bang
You think I'm high nigga, you got me fucked up
I'm looking through your eyes nigga
And I'm tough as fuck, coughing daily
Nigga, look the same popped comet coming at you
Who's gonna stop it? I say we dropping these hits
Straight platinum, can you hack it?
Hell yeah, I'm been rapping since you was going on, what's happening?
Run DMC, can you walk this way?
Hell naw nigga, but I can sure pull my pistol and pop you
Stupid motherfucker
