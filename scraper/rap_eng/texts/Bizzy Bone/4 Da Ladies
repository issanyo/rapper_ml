(Verse 1: Bizzy)
A little something for the ladies, gettin that money by any means
Who get with the player type, thuggish ruggish, from the hood with good genes
Who kick it in high heals, plenty tank tops, camouflage, fatigues
Her thongs clear to the vision, so you can see some good things
Stretch marks, body smoother then Marble floors in hamptons
Lampin large in a condominium or mini mansion
Sidekick mobile phone, three flip like kirk (?)
I'm sorta religious, superstitious, but I ain't scared to flirt
I'm from the dirt, root and soot. Came up on my own foot
Used to hang with the crooks. I keep a job in my books
I took my chance with many girls, but still I look for a woman
I like her crazy, sexy & cool. Waterfalls, good lookin
I can remember back in school, being judged by chicks
And soon I hooked up with the Bone Thugs. Suddenly I'm the shit
And baby's mama drama, karma, dillemas and problems
And now I'm single, ready to mingle, Holla, holla, holla, holla

(Verse 2: Bizzy Bone)
Women who keep a pedicure, a manicure, Plus orchids
Keepin their (? ), Take care of their son's, and their daughters
Wanted ta understand, From a woman who has a man
Hangin' on, (? ) another, Go home, "baby girl scram"
And the love game eyes go blind, When you shine
Please, don't try to be something you ain't, "Quit lying"
Still you're beautiful, The opportunity is around
If you take it, then you take it, If not "don't make a sound"
And never set a brother up, Just so you're man can fight him
Especially, if he don't want you, And he fellin that hottie
It's stupid, when you fight for a woman, Who gonna leave you
It's been written, many women, Have torn down many kingdoms
Seen (? ) go, seen'em run a game (? )
Fun and games and treason, Slug her thangs, when thay drinkin
Where the women at?, "Stand up with out no (tails)"
I like a woman, When you're mans in jail
"You playin the field baby"
