This is for..

(Chorus)
The whole wide world
The whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world
And your neighborhood, and your neighborhood, and your neighborhood
And your neighbor hood

(Verse 1)
Thank God for the love
Cause a nigga was up in the club lookin down on nigga rat scum
Don't wait a single black daddy
With six litttle babies and one hell of a job
Mob in and out cities why is these niggas mad at me?
They say I'm pretty and he dont want his daughter to see
I'm Lil Bizzy thank god for my destiny
I love ya momma ain't no drama in a breath of me

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I barely made it I was runnin around faded gunnin the town up
Comin around the corner jesus I found ya
Dead bodies, my sister stilll wanna party
Nobody can stop me, nobody can stop me
You want everything you want stop searchin for your solemate
Cause you got cha one lets take it easy help him with the homework
Dicipline yall dont need the yellin

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I met hear at a party ready to fuck
And I ain't give a fuck casue she in another nigga truck
You can have that bitch back as soon as I finish I'm fourteen
So I nigga kinda get it

I fell in love the real was I fell in lust
Young and dumb and full of cum
Bitch can I fill it up? damn got a baby in nine months
We was on the getup I was at home cleanin they shit up
Been up since three o'clock in the mornin (the fuck you want!?)

(Chorus Repeat Until Fade)
