We love the reggae and jazz, the rock-n-roll can be cool
Alternative to, we love the rhythm and blues
But I'm a hip-hop baby, from the heart I never flip flop baby

We love the reggae and jazz, the rock-n-roll can be cool
Alternative to, we love the rhythm and blues
But I'm a hip-hop baby, from the heart I never flip flop baby

[Layzie]
If it wasn't for my music, tell me where would I be
Where would I be, probably standin' on the hot block
Sellin' crack rock, runnin' them streets, runnin' them streets
I say my music is my best friend, my confidan I love the way we live
As one together we the perfect bunch, me and my radio
Doin' ninety on the freeway no other way to go
And I like to feel the rhythm, the beat be bumpin' don't it
And I love to give it to y'all because I know you want it
And if you feel like I feel you love the rhythm and blues
Reggae and jazz, and rock-n-roll can be cool
But I'm a hip-hop baby, it's from the heart I never flip flop baby
Gimme a drank and a song and I'll be stress free kickin' it
All night long

[Krayzie]
It ain't nothin' like hip-hop music careful how you use it
And please don't abuse it when you do it music can keep the party
People dressin' up put your mind in a trans and keep you happy
Give it a chance come on, just flow with the music
Get blowed off with music, when I was thirteen
I got the king I had a dream to be one of the greatest musicians
In life so they remember when I die, I love, I love music
It's got me stayin' alive, and if you took my mic right now
One thing you'll never do is take my love away
Cause I'm a hip-hop baby, from the heart I never flip-flop baby

[Bizzy]
Tossin' and turnin' I'm burnin' with different melodies, words
My niggas tellin' me sellin' it to the world, been rappin'
Since the day I heard Rakim, and Dana Dane, Dougie Fresh
Slick Rick, always been a singer mayn, late night foster home
Workin' on perfection on selection of the songs that I heard
Was my direction, as for Tommy was my girlfriend rollin' the wrap
Said I'm the baddest mammma-jammma half white and black
And my babies that Jodeci six with Sabrina, little Bri
Beau Briamous, Mo, and Shaniqa, little Trey-Trey, Destiny, and plus
Aliya and the newest one is Shelby, I can't wait 'til I see her
The other music in my physical form since they was born
I be singin' with tears in my eyes as I perform for the whole world
Until I die like Confuscious tell the world my name is Brian
I'm in love with my music (what, uh, uh)
Cause I'm a hip-hop baby, cause I'm a hip-hop baby
Cause I'm a hip-hop baby, cause I'm a hip-hop..

[Layzie]
Now everybody got that jam that make you get up, wanna boogie
To the beat now, and if it wasn't for the jones and the strings
And the lyrics that we sing what would life really mean now
Would it be just as fun, would you kick it the same, could you
Live with out it, could you still maintain, my thang is
Crank up the volume, because it helps me escape from my problems
'Til I solve 'em, and I'm a solve 'em, it's all music, Bone Thug
Music
