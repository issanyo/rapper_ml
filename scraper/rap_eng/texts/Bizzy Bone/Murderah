Murdarah, Murdarah
Murdarah, Murdarah

Enemies please I keep my chest out believe me
700 laywers and they all actin greedy
Money hungry strugglin while thuggin
My baby momma complain I'm full wit pain
Cigrettes tha tame enemies filled wit pain
Itchy fingers while niggas they snitched out
And bitches inches from havin pussy poppers wit pistol switches
Picture that
I actually I'm happy daddy just dont understand
I'm back on tha block wit chucks and my man
And store my sexuality when all tha chickens where virgins (now)
Rebellin in excursions wonderin if it be burnin up suburbans
And my community we watch fights and it really dont bother me
Sadamized by poverty
Cause nobody think bout our babies
Cause nobody thinkin bout our babies

Yeaaaaa!!!!!!!! murdarah murdarah
Yeaaaaa!!!!!!!! murdarah murdarah

Heavily in tha drug thing
And if they can stop saddam from sellin missiles
How we satuated wit pistols they illegalize
And tax which changed and mark my words
They doin tha same thing wit cocaine
And herb how we everyday handle well
Jesus planted tha seeds and help ease lil boys and girls ease
There minds and I ain't talkin bout smokin weed
Tha word is all you need follow my lead
Im thorough I know wit different homies barrowed thru different girls
Have double barrow pro hammers
And I sold crack to sherrell and blastin
Got cleansed to save my selve and no turnin around cause tha ??????
Cause nobody cause no ones thinkin bout our babies
Cause no ones thinkin bout our babies

Yeaaaaa!!!!!!!! murdarah murdarah
Yeaaaaa!!!!!!!! murdarah murdarah

Here for tha babies and I'm takin my kids wit me
See moses never made to tha promise land satan come get me
He's ready to burn us all baptise is flames like kane
Takin tha shot to my body can enemies aim for my brain
Pray for tha devil hopin he change his ways he still laughin
Screamin I dont know tha half but tell me wha tha fuck done happen
I ain't worried bout a damn thing GOD got my back remember that
And fuck me cause I'm on tha attack
Can't waste my time wit these niggas my brothers are just like me
Makin a form wit tha image but I love to scrimmage wit tha team
Believe in jesus indeed huh
Gotta get more deeper concentrate on tha love
Satan is gettin weaker no ones thinkin bout our babies no ones
Thinkin bout our babies
