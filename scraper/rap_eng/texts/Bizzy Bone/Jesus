Intro:
I don't think they ready for this one, Eric
Tell him
(Shed your blood) *in background*
Cause Jesus was the light of my life
God saves
Cause Jesus shed his blood

Chorus:
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

Through the stormy breeze
And my children play as the day goes
How I feel like
Through the stormy breeze
And my children play as the day goes
How I feel like goin' on...goin' on...I'm goin' on
Cause Jesus makes me feel good

Chorus (x2):
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

Son make sure you always take care of family
And when I'm gone I'm free
But if you need me
Remember to close your eyes
And look to the stars up in the sky son
That's where I'll be
Screamin' seven
Heaven's been waiting for me

Chorus:
Cause Jesus make you feel good (x3)
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

I like to look out my bedroom window
And watch all the children play play play
Just watch them play
But where will they go when the games are over
I hope they got a place to stay
Please do stay
Oh it's a sad situation
Though my heart just keeps on racin'
And one thing that I must know
Tell me

Chorus (x2):
Don't Jesus make you feel good (x3)

We are blessed in the spirit
(Shed your blood)
Cause Jesus makes me feel real good good good
