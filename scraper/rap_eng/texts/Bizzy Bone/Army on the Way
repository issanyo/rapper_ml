[Verse: 1]
Now tell tha devil I can taste hurr (her)
I pull tha pin out my grenade
It's time to pray to whom ever you muthafukkas praying turr (to)
Now heres my cavalry...
My supernatural gamma ray to wreck yurr nation
Dear Lord show them the way...
I feel like I'm the only one whose truly standing for tha Sav... yurr (Saviour)
Because I come from Heavens gate...
Ain't nothing peculiar about the way that I was raised up...

[Chorus]
And my army's on the way...
And my army love to play...
Jump out and pullin' tha pistol
Puttin' it on they're temple make em speak to ya, speak to ya
And my army's on the way
Jump out the, jump out the, jump out the hummer lemme speak to ya, speak to ya

[Bridge]
Didn't expect that they did it
And didn't expect it that they telling they gentlemen
Enemies coming in every direction
And even the weather was giving them hell
And they weeping and wailing
And throwing they dust on they heads and the medicine
Won't even help em
And it's for the welts and the belts of Orion
The sediments elements...

[Chorus]
And my army love to play...
Jump out and pullin' tha pistol
Puttin' it on they're temple make em speak to ya, speak to ya
And my army's on the way
Jump out the, jump out the, jump out the hummer lemme speak to ya, speak to ya
And my army love to play...
Jump out and pullin' tha pistol
Puttin' it on they're temple make em speak to ya, speak to ya

[Verse: 2]
We mix that opium with ree... furr (reefer)
We get so high and naked I can cause a planetary telescopic sei... jurr (seizure)
We show them the way ta win the war
And every world that's if we'll live until to be lead... urrs (leaders)
Before we leave we best ta pray
And praise the Lord
And pass tha ammunition
Nigga give me that hea... durr (heater)
I see they people on they way
And they not playing
They come strapped
And ready to blaze
It's time for us to be they rea... purr (reaper)

[Chorus]
And my army love to play
Jump out and pullin' tha pistol
Puttin' it on they're temple make em speak to ya, speak to ya [x2]

[Bridge]
Didn't expect that they did it
And didn't expect it that they telling they gentlemen
Enemies coming in every direction
And even the weather was giving them hell
And they weeping and wailing
And throwing they dust on they heads and the medicine
Won't even help em
And it's for the welts and the belts of Orion
The sediments elements...

[Chorus] x2
And my army love to play
Jump out and pullin' tha pistol
Puttin' it on they're temple make em speak to ya, speak to ya
And my army's on the way
Jump out the, jump out the, jump out the hummer lemme speak to ya, speak to ya
