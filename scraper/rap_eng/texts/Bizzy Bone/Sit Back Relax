[Verse 1]
Hey it's the Martin and Malcolm
And the Bobby and the Q-we ebony ivory
Brother the others the indians gentlmen
Business executives swing on a pendulum
Livin legends yeah we veterans
No need to tell them they know who we better than
These cigarettes killin me ebony ivory
Peace and war one hell of a diary
See I could get serious dig in y'all chest
Cause people been wearin they bullet proof vest
They so concerned with who was the best
I don't even think about it
I done put my publicist on it
So y'all mothafuckers go read about it
And then sing about it
Bizzy doing solo man have this

[Chorus]
Sit back relax and have a puff or two
Cause all we really tryin' to do is get high with you
That's just how we do
Sit back relax and pop a pikachu
Cause all we really wanna do is roll with you
That's just how we do

[Verse 2]
Seven's my family that's for the industry
Not understanding me handin me hard money
Y'all are vanity losin my sanity
Damned to be (?) heavily had to be mad at me
Doubted me just like my daddy
Niggas don't battle me rat on me
Armaggedon to the saddle we ride, whatever, whatever
I'm ready to die sever the ties dead or alive
Hopefully all of my niggas are fly
Summarize like some of the ties
Cause they didn't wanna see Little B shine
Leader of seven and that is the sign
Holdin the line outta my mind nigga rewind
Tell 'em my crime Bizzy ain't gonna sip none of your wine
Your wine, your wine

[Chorus]
Sit back relax and have a puff or two
Cause all we really tryin' to do is get high with you
That's just how we do
Sit back relax and pop a pikachu
Cause all we really wanna do is roll with you
That's just how we do

[Verse 3]
Blatz all finger to the trippin and slow motion
I roll with my niggas and niggas we all knowin
Flowin and goin' and goin' and goin' and goin'
The original flippin but the pimpin of your poet
Bubblin', dubblin', thuggin' and lovin' my niggas
Brothers and mothers, others aunts, uncles and
Through the winter and all the lil liquor
We be pimpin now nigga done run that that lender
In the double (?) drinkin a mad and runnin around the town
Pull up on suckas I'll pull the gun to my pucker
Fuck y'all I'm a be the mother, motherfucker trust y'all
No further, that's all no one'll go undercover
Better go on the crown and you found
Nobody love you but I stay in the ghetto
Watching these homies goin' blood puddles
It's fucked up but damn I'm still humble

[Chorus]
Sit back relax and have a puff or two
Cause all we really tryin' to do is get high with you
That's just how we do
Sit back relax and pop a pikachu
Cause all we really wanna do is roll with you
That's just how we do
