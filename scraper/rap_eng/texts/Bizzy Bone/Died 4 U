[Hook]
Wish I would a died for you baby
I would a died for you Layzie
I would a died for (seventh sign master mind)
You Krayzie (Bizzy the Kid the midwest cowboy)
But the widow tried to play me (play me)

[Verse 1]
Bone ain't feelin' my vibe
They say Bizzy he think he Pac
Passin out on stage Rollin Stones was shocked
Bizzy the Kid grippin this baby makers
Tellin the whole story
Runnin from cops
Bustin shots smack the top of a forty
I'm never gonna pop
I'm never going back to Ruthless
Stick to the block
You better believe it
And I'm sorry to the fans of Bone
But I'm Bentley, Audi 5's, and drop tops
Blueberry swisher sweet
And that's the way that we monster mash
Homies gonna respect my gangster
Watch the way we count the cash
Bang the gang
Seventh sign
Twenty seven, seven kids
Looking young feelin fit
And I don't have to be pressed or primped
I don't need no make-up neither
I don't want you to touch my hair
I just wanna flow in sickness
Making money everywhere
I don't wanna have pop appeal
I wanna work with real niggas
Real niggas
Trill niggas
Rappin with only ill niggas
Seventh sign crack the seal
Niggas make you wanna kill niggas
Crack the steel pedal to the metal
Mash the gas and that's f'real

[Hook]
Wish I would a died for you baby
I would a died for you Layzie
I would a died for you Krayzie
But the widow tried to play me (play me)

[Verse 2]
I am the general realin incredible better than
Ten year veteran
Off in the cut with a cup of essence
Feel the presense, spread the message
Never no evidence, ain't no best friends
Shut up and handle your business
This the new thang, the true thang
Seventh sign's how we doing thangs
Gangster parties, smokin and drinkin
Puttin on my dancin shoes
Got to get that money right
Pay me and I'll come dance for you
Stay the night and bend your broad
While I'm talkin in turns
Let me swallow that, it tastes like peaches
Must have been a mango blunt
Follow that, I am the future
Evolution of elevation
Knowledge is the power
We shall over come the hatred
With double barrels and rugas
Inscripted like an egyptian
Encrypted like biblical lucifer
Seventh sign conta, seventh sign boy
You can put that on Joanne I met from St. Croix
Sucka
Dippin' out like Ice Cube
Skippin' out like Dr. Dre
Follow the footsteps of rich niggas
Bitch niggas and I'm on my way

[Hook]
Wish I would a died for you baby
I would a died for you Layzie
I would a died for you Krayzie
But the widow tried to play me (play me) x2

[Verse 3]
These are my truest villains
People are fake as hell
Women don't turn me down
Feel me like they feelin Brown
I'd rather be David Ruffin
I don't wanna be Odis Williams
I don't wanna be brew needer
Smokin chronic, drinkin gin and bitch
You ain't everybody
We were the perfect group ha
Promise you broke us up y'all
Bizzy always tells the truth ha
Ain't you a liar, ain't you
You are the venemous snake (ha)
To bad none of the homies got bitten
Hell yeah I wrote this for all L.A. huh
Any rapper wants to battle
Wanna see who goes the fastest
I don't have to study or nothing
I'm a leave that up to you actors
I don't read the Source or the VIBE
When I'm up in Barnes and Nobles
Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Seventh sign soldiers
Standin in my gangsta pose
Shop as a cobra
Look in a mind of a mad man
Medicated with doja
I'm mutilatin this roll call
No metaphor
And the rappin is real
Let it be the hook
Fuck a gimmick
If I die will you kill, nigga

[Hook 'til fade]
Wish I would a died for you baby
I would a died for you Layzie
I would a died for you Krayzie
But the widow tried to play me (play me)
