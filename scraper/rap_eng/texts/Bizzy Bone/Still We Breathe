[Intro - Bizzy Bone]
Yo Crucified... Wassup
I got ya'll hook stuck
Yes, This is what we do
Young Bizzy Bone the kid
Like to skid, Lemme tell you how we do shit

[Hook - Bizzy Bone] (x2)
Ooh, lemme give you what ya need
You better quit hatin' on me
And my army's strapped to the teeth
You do you, and I do me
You'd better get ready, we be Crucified but still we breathe

[Verse 1 - Bizzy Bone]
I give em my glove with the gun
Schizophrenic the man, the mob
Wake up, up out of a coma
Stuck chasin' a [????]

[Hook: Bizzy Bone] (x2)

[Verse 2 - Crucified]

I'ma 'bout the ride, ain't a bore, we go broke up in the bars, and we cared for time flies by
It's admitted, I won't fear the stackin', I feel when you look when I really lie ride by high
Shit, I run to the guy, will I plot my demise, in the dark, full of lie, so they capture the mic
Pressin' the finger, this picture runs outta my soul, is it blessin' me, bust then I try
Wakin' and puff on the blanket the bowl for the souls, they can't fuck around, tell 'em I'll shine
Hickin', I'm on a roll, bitch you were wishin' but I keep on comin' in meteorites
You're wrecked up by near [?], my nation, my flow reputates like gods or will when they standing over
The face and I'm poster the names, a new world is ecation, we're comin' to get you tonight
I don't think I'll make it tonight, it's Bizzy Bone comin' up with Crucified
Deliver the message to open the minds, but they better not see it, they've made their life blind
Am I mistakin' to find the way we are livin' is constantly dyin'
Tryin' to make it by 21 anyones, anyone better, be quick with the mind
Up outta the ground I crawl, reality is nothin' at all
'Til tryin' to break them wrong, I'm writtin' to prison hopin' they fall
Better let they choose stay froze, seen too many funerals
I know the feelings mutual, I hear you God, so here we go...

[Hook: Bizzy Bone] (x2)
