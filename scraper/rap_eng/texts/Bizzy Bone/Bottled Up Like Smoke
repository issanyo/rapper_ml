[Spoken: Bizzy Bone]
I can still feel her from distances and miles away
Galaxies, and dimensions and cosmic aspirations
Are you ready? C'mon

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
So she wants to make me pay
I am expected to lead the way
Baby, I'm on the case
Respect me and clean my slate
Save face and watch what you say
You the thing like I watched you play
Covered it up like smoke
Now that I'm back, you can get all your dough

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Babe, so you expect me to endure your pain?
I can’t wait to, oh, forgive me, okay
I'm gon' bottle it up like smoke
Can you endure this flame?

[Hook: Bizzy Bone]
Say, "I have no conscience, I'm all about game"
And I say, "That’s shallow, and you won't change"
And those words hurt me in the exchange
So I splurge and send my tears away

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
You talk about the women that I'm running with
And why you even care about the women that I'm running with?
The funny thing is I can’t remember
When you was the only woman that was running it
Coming here and talking that gutter shit
The money was good then it was good with the covenant
The money got low and you rolled for the what of it
The better you test when I'm broke with no lovin'
And I'm floating over the flames and maintain my thuggishness
Ready for the world, steady my palms and pearl
And the pearl of the man from sayin it's my girl
Twirl the baton my God cause I twerk
Gonna get it gotta get it and thats when I hurl
The word that I'll honor forever is that I love the bitch
Excuse me, let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss
Excuse me, let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames

[Hook: Bizzy Bone]
Say "I have no conscience, I'm all about game"
And I say "Thats shallow, and you won’t change"
And those words hurt me in the exchange
So I splurge and send my tears away

[Chorus: Jonny Craig]
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames
Do the words still haunt you?
Can you secure its claim?
Bottled up like smoke floating over flames
