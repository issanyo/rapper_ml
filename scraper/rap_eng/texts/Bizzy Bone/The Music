(Intro: Bizzy)
Yeah, one love, one love
Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house
Bizzy Kid the Midwest Cowboy, is in the mother-kirrt house
Is in the mother-kirrt house house, the Kid Bizzy Bone
Playalitical, is in the mother-kirrt house house house house
(Yeahhhhhhhhhh)

(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until the end of days, no matter what you do
And don't you wanna be lovin us because of what we do
How many people in your life you know with us is true
For the millennium what we makin, makin false come true
And until we end up dead, no matter what you do thugs need love too

(Playalitical)
Whisper up my wistful ladies look at what this world made us
Nine 12's in the club, DJ's yokin on the faders
I promoted up my status, now we smokin on the greatest
Clownin with the paper, got a Bose, a house in Vegas
I guess I gotta say this, I got no regrets
If I could go back in time now I'd go the same steps
Look at the Lam' inside the low pro frozen, yes
I'm like ugh, really sick off when I'm gruesome, yes
We got some catchin up to do, put some ketchup on it
Been a long time if you still want it I'ma check up on it
I ain't gon' move you to the side, bein honest ain't a challenge
Only thing I'm gonna move is the commas on my balance

(Chorus)
(Bizzy Bone)
Cause thugs need love as well, and thugs need love too
And thugs need love boo, whoa, whoa, whoa
See thugs need love as well, but could you make my heart swell?
Get outta my mind before I tell
Britney and Alicia, even Brandy, that's my candy girl
Now let me welcome you into my little dandy world
Me and my man's at the club, he got a girl but I'm single
I got the song on and poppin, Bizzy Bone finna mingle
Tellin me I can feel the jingle as the slow jam play
And tellin me I can feel the tingle of this Tangueray
Shavelle my belle, how you doin baby? I'm ridin
Wanna hit it from the back, baby that's perfect timin
Side by side, you and I, would you watch my back?
I guess the fact of doin what we doin, see that's that
I say now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
Come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what
She don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, huh
Now come gimme dat, come gimme dat
Come gimme dat, come gimme dat, what what
If you don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, slut

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
