[Hook: Heaven]
If the globe stops spinnin and the sky falls down
And the wall on the mountain and the trumps make sounds
When the hands stop tickin and the holes rotten
And the sails get broken you'll all be down

[Interlude: Bizzy Bone]
Yeahhh, gimme that water baby
It's gonna drive me crazy, better watch yo' back here playa
Yeahhh, gimme that water baby
It's gonna drive me crazy, better watch yo' back here playa

[Bizzy Bone]
Stuck in the game, passin the flames on these lames
Never could fade me, enter my wall of shame
Hotter then lava, and the sound of the kitchen cajan mayne
Maintain the main thang, blame, it is a mystical frame
Enter the circle, exit quicker than aim
Slums up in the barrio, baby I guess I'm a bum, hey
Come for me momma, it ain't nothin but legitimate rhyme skills
And baby as we represent the one all the way
In the circumference, dunn-dunny gimme the money
Hun-ga-ry motherfuckers, say what? I'm still sunny
Bizzy he does it, what was it? What is it?
Hittin 'em harder in the bank, inquisitive with the straight saints
Daintily in the ain't, is followin the bears
Inquisit me, is you crazy? I know you know what it is
It's just a starter, if I'm a martyr, give me my paper
Knee-deep like sheep, these wolves, they can't escape us
One time

Holla back, you gimme the rhythm, I hit 'em up in that Ac'
And I hit 'em up in that back, if need be, the mac
Slack? Never, put it on the 12th of September
You better get everything you need, remember - one time
Baby boy feelin the clout, gimme the music properly
Yes, I'm God's property, monopoly, who gonna stop me?
Nobody, gettin in 'em, we winnin, seein the women
Venomous in the minimum, baby boy as we sendin 'em
Endin 'em in the beginnin, renderin what they want
But I don't pay no fuckin taxes, I only smoke up the blunt
And I don't have time to front, you're rollin with me well let's move
We duck the funerals, the usual, Bizzy let's groove
One time

[Hook] + [Interlude]

[Bizzy Bone]
Secular, molecules protectin us, brain waves respectin us
Punk motherfuckers, they ain't connectin us
Recollectin us and we bust, in God we trust
And the plus, I got a mission, precision listen to us, trust
In the imperial, water floatin and flowin
Get it up, uptown all around, they not knowin
Skyline, high line, I sign this
Give me my money motherfucker I'm pissed
One time in the apparatus, no status, no Gladys
Only the pimps, no simps, we still rappin
Keepin it movin for me, no nuts, no glory
No to headstrong, scary story, that purgatory
I said it's ore-y or we eerie, do you hear me much clearly?
The streets in the direction and real people can feel me
Said it's ore-y or it's eerie, do you hear me, much clearly?
Still in the direction and real people can feel me
One time
