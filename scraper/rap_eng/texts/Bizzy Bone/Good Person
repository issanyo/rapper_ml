Am I a good person?
Or is that something I'm telling myself to sleep at night
Please say I'm worth it
Cause theses demons are not letting go of my crippled mind

[Krayzie Bone]
Just sittin' back thinkin' while up, Hennessy is drinking, done a whole lot of livin'
I done seen many schemes, chased plenty dreams, I had done a whole lot of sinnin'
It really make me wonder how I don't go under
Tryna stay alive and survive through this thunder storm
But what did I do, what did I do wrong?
Am I a bad man
Cause I tried to get the things I never had, man
Was dealt the bad hand
But I maintain my life and changed my life
Even with these cards, I play the game right
Could you please shine one of your blessings down on me?
My life is a mess, many levels of stress and I really could use one now

[Bizzy Bone]
I was raised in the wrong way
Kidnapped, lost in the hallway
Po-Po looking for me, have my picture on the wall
They make me think it's all about struggling, never nothing but the vision of a tall grave
All day let their brain saute, I can sit in the pit but the niggas called me, let me get with the clique that'll flaunt me
Now they gone and I got the demon on me
Can't relax, just a passion of this can resign with my girl
My niggas are gonna dip
It's back to the whip, and that'll be the shit that make a motherfucker call a mother- (Mmmm)
Gotta be what I been through
But I wonder why, I probably want it to the end too
So I talk to myself, I'm learning
Am I a good person that's in tune

[Bizzy Bone]
See myself in the mirror
But it didn't get clear
Am I still me?
Am I still here?
(X2)

I'm not so there, yeah ain't goin' anywhere
I don't really care
(X4)
