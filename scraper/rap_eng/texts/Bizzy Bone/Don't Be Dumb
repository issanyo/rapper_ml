(Chorus)
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....

See, I went down and dirty and she liked the sucky sucky
And liked it all in her tummy, and started askin for money
It was over
Off to another one, never leave my house without packin a gun
Jumped in the Benzino, while Nikki was in L.A. smokin primo
She said no one could make her cum, til she came met Gambino
I ain't need no introduction, im that Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone
And I dont give a fuck what you got goin on
I left Watts, gold Zenith tootin, while shootin my show
Is that cocaine?
Boo, you gotta go
I miss her though
Back on the ho stroll, drinkin and losin control
Got back to Cleveland and hooked back up with Mo Mo
Pretty young thugstress, who loved the thug shit
And on the lo lo, I like that, even rolled the getaway
Cause I ain't that ordinary thug, go on all about that gun play
Soon as she popped up with a baby, drivin me crazy
Watched her push it out, cut the cord, little Christian, love you baby

(Chorus)
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....

(Bizzy)
So now we havin sex again, hittin some different levels
The babys lookin Mexican, I look at you like the devil
My sisters only using you, cause I never abused you
So shes doin it for me, only if you knew, boo
And plus, she fucked Layzie, was makin eyes with Krayzie
And old Flesh had her first, but im that one that made it work
You can kiss my ass, hear my laugh
Hear me now and listen later
Anyway, im still the playa
On the real bitch, you hurt me, if that's any consolidation
You was just another temptation, on to the next one
Thats enough of her
My belt is just the way I like it
Dont bite it and you can get it when you want to
You love the way I ate that, your girl hated that
But dont be dumb
I guess its too late for that

(Chorus)
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....

(Bizzy)
I'm cummin! Tellin me you love little Bizzy
God dont like ugly, and he ain't too fine or pretty, is he?
Oh, and I seent you hangin with sissies
All that sinnin, women with , actin feminine
But you said he a sho' thang, that'll make him a better friend
But then again, how could I judge?
But they still can't kick it with the thug
Check all the glasses, and check the toilet seat for bugs
As soon as you passed it, I was high enough
I ain't a facist, cause I dont like to kick it with faggots
Do yo thang, and I hope that God helps you on your quest for thangs
Rain, rain go away, come back another day

(Talking)
I don't love them hoes
I don't love them hoes
And the moral of this story is don't love them hoes
If you searchin for somethin
You searchin for a woman
You searchin for a man
But through your search
You gonna come through a lot of obstacles
A lot of twists, a lot of turns
But you gotta be able to taste it to know what's sweet
To know what's sour, to know what's good, to know what's bad
But fuck all that get back to the chorus

(Chorus)
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss
And this is....
Don't be dumb
