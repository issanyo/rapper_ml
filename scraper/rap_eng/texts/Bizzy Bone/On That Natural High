[Intro]
Yeah, Capone, we back at it again
Shoutouts Bone Thugs 'N' Harmony
Wassup, young Layzie Bone?
Young Krayzie Bone? Young Wish Bone?
Congratulations, Flesh N Bone
For finally gettin' up out of jail
I am Bizzy Bone, the Kid
Young Glory Fend in full affect after the assention
Yes, indeed no tension
And just remember, never forget to mention
God first, uh, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I say my preachy flow like cream stackery umbrella
Holy water to shower my skeletons
And gather my Bones together
Let the world wind swirl inside of my vessel
Have no association with the Devil
Nah, nigga, Heaven is on my level
You never speak to the Savior
Castin' them down quietly, pick me against the irony
Television with wings, be gang-bangin' the spirit
Leave me the fuck alone, I've been cool since Jesus feel us

[Chorus]
Take a breath and breath it
That's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath and breath it
It's just like Heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath and breath it
Just take a breath and you will touch the sky
Take a breath and breath it
You know that oxygen puts me on a cloud

[Verse 2]
I'm smoother then Omarion, strong soldier like Gibson
Belly-dancin' like gypsies, carryin' on a mission
Tipsy upon this oxygen, snortin' the toxin given
Focusin' on the molecules, no focus on vixen
Crack money my recipe, Kentucky Fried Chicken
Lifted up with wings of angels with no predictions
I'm posted up like missin' dogs, barkin' towards expedition
Father Jesus keep on servin' them, uh, and I won't listen
It's like revalations, they took us to the beginnin'
And even if we lose, we still winnin'
Watch out 'cause Judas isn't
And time is so forgivin', but some of us overdid it
Goodfellas, we hoodfellas, you know I'm on this mission
Holla back!

[Chorus]
Take a breath and breath it
That's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath and breath it
It's just like Heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath and breath it
Just take a breath and you will touch the sky
Take a breath and breath it
You know that oxygen puts me on a cloud

[Verse 3]
All lions need a lion, and God don't need a thing
I sing to the most masterful: we slaves, not kings
And I bring fire from the Heaven if I could not ming
I'm like a shadow, you enlighten me to tend so many beings
I said send me twelve thousand, and ruben the same thing
Benjamen get to sayin' we just gon' take the shame
Slain lambs on credus, like pigs with no breakfast
Kids with no destiny, loyal to Christ excellent
Mathematics and excellence

[Chorus]
Take a breath and breath it
That's what I do when I'm on that oxygen
Take a breath and breath it
It's just like Heaven it puts me on a natural high
Take a breath and breath it
Just take a breath and you will touch the sky
Take a breath and breath it
You know that oxygen puts me on a cloud
