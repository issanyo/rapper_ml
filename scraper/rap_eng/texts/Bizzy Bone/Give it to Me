[Chorus: Felecia Howse]
I've been up and I've been down
Around the world and round and round
A real G.P. is what I've found
And this is how it's goin down

[Hook: Layzie Bone]
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gonna give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it

[Verse 1: Layzie Bone]
I'm a +Answer+ like A.I. and +The Truth+ like T-Mac
Little Layzie Bone keep them hookers on they back
Got more game than a motherfuckin referee
I'm the shit baby girl, wanna fuck with me?
Nigga don't test that nigga Lay' Bone, call up Kray' Bone
Flesh Bone, Wish Bone, nigga be gettin Bizzy on
Any nigga that's wanna step to the Thugs
Catch a slug fuckin with us, you know we gets 'em up
Them certified platinum playas pimpin through yo' city
Niggas lookin with envy cause they bitches wanna get with me
Them worldwide ballers, and everywhere we go
I keep my heat right by my side, in case you ain't know

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Freddy Tiffany, show 'em how the pimpin be
Show 'em how the women be, sippin on Hennessy
It's for the energy, dippin in the gangsta party
Little Lay' this is Eazy-E, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
I'll never fall in love, married to Bone Thugs
We all need hugs, send me to Heaven when I recieve slugs
It ain't no justice, just us
Bust in the dark, fuckin off y'all suckers
Gettin swallowed in the city lights
In the black stretch somethin, a brother livin the city life
Ain't it a pity, right? Never saditty bitches
Posted up, coked up, soaked it up, fuck you nigga

[Chorus: Felecia Howse]
I've been up and I've been down
Around the world and round and round
A real G.P. is what I've found
And this is how it's goin down

[Hook: Layzie Bone]
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gonna give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Kick it in high speeds, high off weed
See I'm a +Thug By Nature+, swallow my seeds, yeah
Fresh out the county to the stage and bleed, 'til I pass out
Grey Goose, can't stop stressin
Back to the streets slangin soft and minks
Paid the cost to be the boss, ain't nothin' sweet
This is David Ruffen, Freddy pink Tiffany
Snub-nosed tramp, 5'7", the epiphany, literally

[Bridge: Layzie Bone + Felecia]
Let the music get up in you, bounce to the rhythm
Baby girl you lookin' good to me
And I done had a shot a liquor, she lookin' way thicker
Bring that ass on over to me

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone]
It's Kelly Robinson, that's how I be mobbin on them
G.P. thuggin all the time, baby I'm a monster on the blunt
I never 'sponds to no one, I be sharin +The Gift+
Livin in +Heaven'z Movie+, no more runnin the strip
Totin clips, in my bad ways, livin like it's the last days
Some of y'all bitches nasty, a real G.P. is graphic
All day e'ry day, Lil' B and Lil' Lay'
Kelly Robinson niggas and motherfuckin Krayzie

[Chorus: Felecia Howse]
I've been up and I've been down
Around the world and round and round
A real G.P. is what I've found
And this is how it's goin down

I've been up and I've been down
Around the world and round and round
A real G.P. is what I've found
And this is how it's goin down

[Hook: Layzie Bone]
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gonna give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it

She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it
She gon' give it to me, she gon' let me hit it
She gonna give it to me, give it to me, let me hit it
