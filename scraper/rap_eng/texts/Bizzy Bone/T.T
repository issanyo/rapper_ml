[Intro: Bizzy Bone]
We gon' call this song "Trickery and Treachery"
And man that's how these motherfuckers do
Man we gon' gear up these muh'fuckin soldiers man
Man up, fuck it do what you do

[Bizzy Bone]
Tell 'em that it's the trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces, been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, man up, yeah
Proud of the mental methodical mind hunter
Another game slumber game sleep if you wanna
Man up from unknown places when it's simple to be in love
Chromosomes broke down wonder is stuck
But when enough is enough, and it's tough
Throughout the roughest where the red wolves huff and they puff
Hey little Bizzy keep they head strong, cry now, can't even cuff
You understand it ain't no question, come up
What is the purpose of the physical lust? So the barricade can bust
Braids shaved ain't no bitches in us, we don't believe in no luck
But that's the word game, can't even cuff
Ya understand it ain't no question come up, ya understand

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, ya better tell 'em
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up

[Bizzy Bone]
Back up in the saddle with my homies down in the cattle
Black boots, my fatigues and a satchel
Keep my eye up on the motherfuckin twos and the sixes
Get the fuck in the car, and put ya mind on the one-time bitches
You better know who the fuck we are, soldiers now
Fuck they try to figure me out, it's my style
But I was born with the jewel of a child
And it better be women around, I don't give a fuck if she wild
Ya fuckin with me? I tell her quickly bitch sit down, get down
You know I'm known to clown around and get around
That's the word praise God spirit
Shake your motherfuckin stick when the evil get on ya nerves, ya heard?

[Chorus 2X: Bizzy Bone]
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up

[Bizzy Bone]
Wanna crawl up out ya spiritual grave, if you a slave
To the wicked it's the critical mystical get out the way
Bitch, I'm gettin paid, whatever they say, shake the dust
Movin in +Heaven'z Movie+, in God we trust
Back to +The Gift+, let's get 'em lifted right now
Don't get caught up in the liquid, do da thang my mayne
What if I told you this was spiritual, not in yo' brain
Spread love baby break that chain
Pay attention to the laws, wash yo' drawers by hand if you have to
Praise God always all day before and after
Then take it to the tabernacle, cleanse that body
Learn the happiness and freedom that you felt from ya mommy
Heavenly Father they are gigglin, think this is a game
Let our words not be in vain; and remember

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
That was trickery, treachery; damn they was treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, ya understand
That's trickery, treachery; damn they treacherous
This is gettin biblical baby nobody F'in us
Seen a lot of faces and been through so many phases
Give me Cristal baby man up, ya understand

[Outro: Bizzy Bone]
Uhh, uhh, ya understand
Ya understand, and we represent the one
Yeah, yeah
In the name our lord and savior Jesus Christ, yes indeed
You know what it is, one true God
Yeah, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh...
