[Intro: Q Loco]
Yeah you know what it is...

Yeah, Yeah, yeah...
One time for they mind yo
One time for they mind yo
Get to 'em
Get 'em baby!

[Hook]
See I know all about you
And I made you hot when you not
And now you talking fast actin' like you something you not
So when I talk about you can't even remember your name
Cause all these playa haters lookin' the same, nigga

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
I t-t-took a picture
With the quickness I come get withcha niggas stop your ticka
Read the scripture, dismiss ya, then forgive ya got ya bitter
I don't know you, I don't know you, a little quick forgetter
Like you never existed in my picture take it to ya
It's like a nigga never knew you
My homies they wanna do ya
I'm holding 'em back from screwin' ya
You wanna be me, in my business you wanna be a rat
You ain't cappo you ain't Bizzy and you ain't dappa
Allah's God Allah's my master
Create a fly, You ain't fly
You would shoot me in the back like Brother Ty
It's only I, who tried and get you off the coke crack
Focused your mind and made you wanna go rap
How could you do me like that
And I still gotta forgive, got a clean heart
Prosperous as I live
And now you know the truth, do what you do without me
You ain't gangsta, ain't ganging, ain't gankin' a G

[Hook]
I know all about you
And I made you hot when you not
And now you talking fast actin' like you something you not
So when I talk about you can't even remember your name
Cause all these playa haters lookin' the same

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
You wanna start somethin', you ain't even Muslim
Wasting my time with your wack rhymes and ya bluffin'
Your homies are fruity so I question if they even like coochie
What ever happened to the pimpin' that you said you was doin'
Got your people gooey, ain't never seen me before
Man they don't never boo me, never confuse me whore
Strangle my mind like I'm blind and you hoes can't find
Look at you jealous of my fellas I'm a chillin' proclive
You a dime, you a boy, you a toy indeed
You don't got no joy so you make prank calls to me
And what you see is the real how you feel don't brag
I don't care about your choices, but I'm just not a fag

[Hook]
See I know all about you
And I made you hot when you not
And now you talking fast actin' like you something you not
So when I talk about you can't even remember your name
Every playa hater lookin' the same

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
So Mr. Crackhead, ecstasy, poppin' wannabe
Mr. Cokesniffah, cocklicker, wannabe Alicia Keys
I'm a rock n' roller holder of the heart of a G
And I promise you can never be me, don't even try it
It's too expensive to buy it
Too extensive to (say) it
Artificial feelin' of drugs, can't even fly with it
So come and try it, you don't stand a chance in here
It's your weakness in your lust that'll make you a queer
I'm on every tier, with every tear I give
They are not for you, only for God I live
See Allah's God Muhammed as messenger may peace be appointed
My lord and master help me stay up on 'em

[Hook]
Cause I know all about you
I made you hot when you not
And now you talking fast actin' like you something you not
So when I talk about you can't even remember your name
Cause all you playa haters lookin' the same

Holla back!

I know all about you
I made you hot when you not
And now you talking fast actin' like you something you not
So when I talk about you can't even remember your name
Cause every playa haters lookin' the same

One time...

[Verse 4: Tha Realest]
I knew you were bitch niggas from jump street
You can't deny my street tactics now police follow me
You played that home boy grown bitch too easy
Now nigga come see me
Switch the game up now niggas they wanna be me
Too much leadership to play that backburna'
Military minded motherfucker like I'm Nat Turner
Gotta watch myself around your kind cause you talks a lot
Always opening up your trap but your rhymes ain't high
Hire me as your ghostwriter, I won't tell
All money spend good nigga see me in hell
Spit shells while my je-wels shine in the rarest form
Put me on a track with Bizzy nigga and we''ll do you harm
Allah, please let me apologize in advance
These niggas they made me do it give me one more chance
Return my pistol to my pants, and I stepped out true
I'm just telling what it is motherfucker cause I knew all about you!
