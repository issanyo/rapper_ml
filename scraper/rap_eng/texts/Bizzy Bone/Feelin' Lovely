Sippin muggle, feelin lovely, dizzy smokin sticky icky, in every city my ni***s rollin wit me, strapped up on me, yaheard i got kicked out of bone thugs n harmony? what u thinkin, im a soldier, survive, the ugly, dont come around me if u whiskin 4 money i ain't got it, u kno i just got out of the jail?

And i be runnin from the police, all week
We bin drinkin and smokin rollin them swisher sweets
When we get up in the club they tell us 2 leave
Its something about liqour make u c enemies (who is that?) [Wrong i think..]
My body luv drinking hennesy
Adrenalin pumpin im thuggish ruggish with energy
Heaven is where we wanna be!! and money is what we wanna see!!

I got them bullets that'll move ya body, body!!
Put em in a gangster like hasta~la~vista
I'm ghetto like [gostos for mostas [or something..]]
Its time for the four, hail ceaser
Walk through here with the gasoline jacket, snatchin the reefer
Gotta go, go, fresh out of the county, steady as we grow
All of my ni***s is dead.. and im bein questioned by the feds
Let me know what they said ,enemies sleepin in my bed
This was written by my bishop wit this vision in my head
Hey, let me c u left marsh, do it for death charge
I can feel the vision wit my company in red
Let me know what they said, cuz they fake like they my friends
Its the jealousy in them, and the zealousness in them
And u can tell em once again, i, my people winnin
U can choke and it [??] seemless sprees is spinnin
Got this skeez blending breeze, i make a week at the knees
I mean literally, i make a week at the knees!
