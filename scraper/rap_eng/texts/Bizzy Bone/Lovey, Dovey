(Intro: Bizzy)
Get your money mayne (one time for they mind baby)
Get your money mayne, go get your money mayne (yeah yeah)
Go get your, go get your money mayne (get off me, get off me!)
Go get your, go get your money mayne (one time)
Get your money (Bizzy Bone, The Midwest Cowboy)
Go get your money mayne (holla back boys)
You so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper kick back (one time baby, c'mon)
Hey, don't let 'em search you, only talk to God (c'mon now)
In a mirage, duck the mEnage and (you know what it is)

(Chorus: Bizzy Bone)
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly (hey)
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the mEnage, and blahzay-blah (uhh, one time)
Baby go get your money, you're so lovey dovey
Concentrate on your paper, kick back, and sip bubbly (hey)
Don't let 'em search you, only talk to God
In a mirage, duck the mEnage, and blahzay well blahzay-blah (one time)

(Bizzy Bone)
Duckin the system and I'm wonderin if it's physical
Baby I'm feelin the fury and the money and it's still spiritual
Somebody tellin me why you hurtin me baby you hurtin yourself
Feelin the one I'm feelin the same, see you around the town passin me
Cause I'm a loner on the planet taken for granted
With only one body to manage, no knowledge I'm schizophrenic
Tellin me I should suck your johnson just to humble myself
Charles Bronson, strictly the victim, I'm comin in with stealth
Huh, who do you believe in? I believe in God Almighty
The prophets, the saints and the angels, Michael and son righteously
Don't ask me any questions after that, we ridin
Stack blame, bless Jacob the Jeweler, we not slidin
Bring work constantly, and get you 9 percent
And that's for your own protection, what do ya mean I don't pay rent?
So why should I have to suck it? I'm so fuckin (Thuggish Ruggish)
I'd rather fill my mouth with sharp-ass teeth so we both can love it
Fuck it, I go celibate, celebration of elements
My sentiments exactly, and exact me through these tenements
Testimony been done, repentance bein taken care of
Nobody to care for me? Well fuck it, I'm finna share love

(Chorus)
(Bizzy Bone)
Rollin in a hoopty or a bucket, who gives a fuck
Listin to slow cuts, smokin weed, so what
And held up, I'm in a hold-up, Bizzy baby don't fold up
And this is ain't the way it's supposed to be, I'm tellin ya, I told ya
Soldier, grown men callin theyself Jehovah
I only hope when they get judged that they was representin Jehovah
No adultery don't ever roll over
Feelin the pain of a spiritual warrior wanted a platform to warn ya
Been scorned, ever since I was born, "America's Most Wanted"
John Walsh family in a trailer park in Oklahoma
You want it? Yes I'm on it, B we on it fo' sho'
'Member you want it you go get it, I'm wit it, admit it you know (yeah)
Ha (for the utmost) for the utmost baby, fo' sho' the tongue's wicked
Pay attention to the water and the way that we kick it
Pray over the food (over the food) bless this meal
Bow down and kneel, and we never accept the seal
Or the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy
Let me give you knowledge (one time for they mind) let me stop my ramblin
Or the number of the beast, I serve God, not mammy
Instead of me givin you extra knowledge, let me stop my ramblin
One time

(Chorus)
(Bizzy Bone)
On that tropical, logical thinkin, E's an impossible
Probable, beer in the bottle, I'm full throttle
Unstoppble, jealousies make 'em envy my words
So they can think of somethin heinous to do, when I'm on the curve
Smoke herb with my closest family members and friends
Bend corners in the Lambo while I'm stackin them ends
One for the dub and the real, together always
And if the end of the world comes and we call V
See the Lord'll save his children, I love him, may I exalt him
Above the heavens and the Earth the creator is L's calling
Ultra (Alpha and Omega), the father Jesus Christ
My everything I love you, you so right
Expressions of my heart, it gets painful to think
Baby why do you think - that I drink, that I drink, that I drink
Anything that you need if it's possible, I'll supply
I can help but I'm emotional and that's why I cry
One time

(Chorus)
