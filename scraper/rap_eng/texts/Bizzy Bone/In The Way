[Chorus: DJ Paul]
Yo
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
Way, way in the way, way
See, y'all niggas in the way!
See, y'all niggas in my way!
See, y'all niggas in the way!
Send these haters out in space!

[Verse 1: Berner]
They in the way
Kill the middle man, we ain't payin' no extra taxes
I got a big spot with hella lights, hit 3 P's on the average
In this cell, look at my [?], look at my crib, I'm doin' well
And we don't tell, we sit down in solitary and go through hell
Yeah, that money come and the money go but the money never made us
Yeah, that Bay Area it's one big graveyard for the players
Yeah, I'm old-school, I don't ever change
These girls still bring me paper
Bought a Benz, never had no scraper
Had a whole trunk full of flavor
All these blacks bags, these brown bags
My body's covered in gold
They was in my way back home so I had to hit that road
I took two pills, smoked two joints, drank two bottles and I'm gone
Got that big body on chrome
It's big Berner and that Bone, Bone

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
Yo
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
Way, way in the way, way
See, y'all niggas in the way!
See, y'all niggas in my way!
See, y'all niggas in the way!
Send these haters out in space!
Tell them niggas they better get the fuck on up out my way

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Y'all better get the fuck out the way, man
Why niggas keep fuckin' up the game plan?
They keep on talkin', I'mma kill 'em with the same hand that I fed 'em with
That's where they lay dead
Don't [?], go breakin' bread with these lames
These niggas fake as hell with they claims
Mission is the make the mil' and get paid
In case you gotta pay your bills, don't wanna sit in a cell
Try'na block my glow
Niggas have to plot at my door, try'na stop my show, no
Double-edged I'm comin' out the door, chuckin' mother fuckers to the floor
Unload and reload some more
Get out my mix
I don't even want y'all niggas in the picture next to the mr. sawed-off
Spit ya, rip ya head right from your shoulders
I get contagious, y'all mother fuckers can't fade us
The game won't change us, never mind famous
Run it, Bone [?] was [?] start blazin', spark the flame
Y'all keep blockin' my way, excuse me
Outta my way, outta my lane

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
Yo
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
Way, way in the way, way
See, y'all niggas in the way!
See, y'all niggas in my way!
See, y'all niggas in the way!
Send these haters out in space!

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Get up out my kingdom, my kingdom, my kingdom
Get up out my kingdom
Any nigga that's trollin' that shit's just hoe'ish
[?] that bitch inside ya, in case you ain't know it
When I say leave me alone, I mean it
Get up out my, get up out my
I already got my loved ones with me, you ain't good to be with
And of course I've seen it
You know when a nigga can team with or even achieve a dream with
All the shimmer and shine you have is sequins and then there's no secrets
I can't even sink my teeth in
Somebody a fiends with, they smokin' out all these hoes
Givin' up they temple, they don't know
Get up out my
Guppy in the way but they always in the way when I do it like I'mma do it like I did it that day
Finna get you now no matter what you say, no matter what do, no matter what you bring
Got her thinkin' I was down but my feet are on the ground
Let a hoe be a hoe, let a clown be a clown

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
Yo
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
See, y'all just in the way, way
Way, way in the way, way
See, y'all niggas in the way!
See, y'all niggas in my way!
See, y'all niggas in the way!
Send these haters out in space!
