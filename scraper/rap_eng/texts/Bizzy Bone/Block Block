I’m at house
Fuck your brain
Let a young nigga shine
Lookin’ good ,my friend
Let’s soak up the gang,but don’t drown
Collect all that is in my life
We are still cheap,all night
Surrounded by young things
Possibly doing the right way

Not the things I did to make me fall
Never talk
Give me my watch,that shit is low
Busting and shooting niggas

Those niggas ain’t coming close to me
Quality over gut
Got the hands of a man,this is part of me,the gut

Living a crazy life
But it ain’t that crazy to me
