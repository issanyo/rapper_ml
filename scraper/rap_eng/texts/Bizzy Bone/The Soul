Coming to you straight from cosmos by the way of Gabriel
With the Grim reaper on my shoulders

I look into the soul
The spirits are hypnotized
And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know)
The devil want me to die
And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold)
Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes)
I chop up the lamp the sacrifice
For my bloodline and then it's on
I look into the soul

No daddy don't rape me baby
Cause I was raised in the hood called what the fuck (what the fuck)
I left mama cause that's the way we
I'm on the move and I groove that's enough
I ain't trippin on none of you
But with the thugs I can do anything we want
Give me nothing I'll better make something
Cause if the angels don't love you then I bet they love us
I gotta get my head up out the way
I gotta get my people just past the day
The first time when I see you pass away
The last time I'm a leave you out of the way
Nigga if I don't leave ya now
I've been runing running
I keep running running
More than you can believe me now
I keep steady steady steady (hey!)

I look into the soul
The spirits are hypnotized
And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know)
The devil want me to die
And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold)
Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes)
I chop up the lamp the sacrifice
For my bloodline and then it's on
I look into the soul

Oh daddy no popping no packing
Cause I was praised in the ghetto my body erupt
Everybody say get you a gatty
Cause you a skinny nigga you gonna need you a gun
I get the flippin in fucking them up
If Lil Layzie tell me shoot em I'm shootin them up
One-fity-one and I'm good and drunk
Remember the words take him over I'll fuck him up
I gotta get my head just out the way
I gotta get my people just past the day
The third time I'm a see you walk away
The last time I'm a leave you out the way
Nigga if you don't leave me now (leave me now)
I've been running running
I keep steady running
And if they don't believe me now
Just behead him (behead him, behead him)

I look into the soul
The spirits are hypnotized
And I defy every rule that I know (I know, I know)
The devil want me to die
And I survive even if I'm in the cold (in the cold, in the cold)
Everyone looks like my eyes (like my eyes)
I chop up the lamp the sacrifice
For my bloodline and then it's on
I look into the soul
