[Intro]
You stand here beside me, and all the times you just pretend
To be my friend

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Nigga, get your hands up out my fuckin' pockets
Before I cock this AK-4-7 and rot your body (might...)
Opposites plottin' niggas don't think I'm watchin'
Get 'em in my scope
They say keep your, enemies in focus, watch 'em closely
Niggas that takin' a roll in it comes in a (?) slowly
'Cause of the money man, and that can be a dangerous thing
'Cause when they play with the paper Krayzie go loco insane
My nigga, I just let you hang
So quit telling mothafuckers you my brotha nigga, cause I just now met ya
So don't play me to close, so keep your distance cause I'll split ya
For tryin' to infiltrate mine
What about my nickel plate nine
These niggas ain't no friends of mine
Niggas get drunk and tell you they
Love you 25 times in one night
Next thing you know, niggas is kickin' in your door for your life
Got your wife and your kids, and your crib this your shit
You see he was fuckin' around with them suckas and you started trustin' the mothafuckas
Nigga, don't you know, you can't trust no one at all
Cause that one might be the one that get you bring you down, make you fall

[Chorus]
What's friends (what's friends)
I don't want no more friends (no more friends)
I don't need no more friends (no more friends)
I can't take no more friends
Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends)

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
This is strange shit; if he'd explain shit
Don't act like you'd understand this like we would be on some lame shit
I read it all in your conversation, you think I didn't pin your player hation
Gotta nigga thinkin' Mo Murda when I face him
Put him on down
With a real situation
Take 'em, nigga, this how we take 'em dog
Nigga will sing us with song nigga will spin us what's wrong
It's all real (real) you haters was born to piss me off
Or kill (kill), nigga we comin' to break you off nigga break you off
Somethin' proper (proper)
You used to be my nigga, now I might have to watch ya
Ghetto bird snitchin' like a helicopter
So when you see me comin', dog, I might have to pop ya (pop ya)

[Chorus]
What's friends (what's friends)
I don't want no more friends (no more friends)
I don't need no more friends (no more friends)
I can't take no more friends
Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends)

What's friends (what's friends)
I don't want no more friends (no more friends)
I don't need no more friends (no more friends)
I can't take no more friends
Because they always end up back stabbin' in the end
What's friends (what's friends)

[Bridge: Bizzy Bone]
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong we're ready to get the battle on and
Ride or die
Ain't nothin' wrong I'm ready to get my battle on

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
You my aquittant so what am I 'posed to do
I'm gettin' closer to the Angel of Death fuckin' with you
I don't make promises, promises
So how can I owe you naughty kids
So I won't hold you carry a load, I only fuck with soldiers
Seventh sign ride rolled 'em all over, he's the benign
Double Glock whole clique no colder
Beef with niggas, I'm trippin' I'm just ready to pop a clip in let me fall back in line {laughs}

Bone Thug connect gang
Bone Thugs forever

[Chorus]
