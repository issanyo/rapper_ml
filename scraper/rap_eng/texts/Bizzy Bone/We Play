[Verse 1]
Give me an ounce for three fifty
Nigga need a quick divorce, my niggas keep tellin' me
What they keep sayin' about being the source
Well I don't read magazines
Nigga that's just irritation
Bizzy reads the type of books to further along his education
Little do they know about wha, wha, wha
Little do they know about who, who, who
Little do they know about me, me, me
Eaze, and tell about you, you, you
Ain't no time to be trippin' the women
Cause women will grab you get caught up 'n shot
Little niggas them bitches is yours, so slap on a rubber
And beat up the cock, little niggas y'all so horny
Only got your car for broads, how could I be hatin'
When y'all are the fakest niggas I've ever saw
Y'all rollin' with snitches, I don't know no snitches
I roll with real niggas 'til they fall off
God put them up 'fore they lose they briches
And I feel my children love me
Daddy gots to do more better
Balance help me makin' money, and spendin' more time with them
With them, with them, stack up in the middle
Play me like fiddle, feel "B" like everyday
Don't be fickle motherfuckers

[Chorus]
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
That's how we play..

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't it be better if we could just choose the future
Blood mixed up common fusion, thug picked up outta people
No Ruthless, no medusa see I got jacked in Beverly Hills
Still I keeps it real, very selective
Wanna just smoke and chill
See I'm a veteran all the grenade launchers won't cost me much
Anyone can get Xâ€™d off, yeah nigga ya can be touched
I did all my dirt in the burbs
I was ridin' around with my sisters baby's father
Double barrel shotgun say word
Ready or not here come my words
Steady or not that shit's absurd
I already got me all perturbed
Hop on the block hittin' all my nerves
This is the life style of that prick sellin' been forcified
Niggas don't let him lie to y'all
I'm a tell the truth on mine, and I really wanna war
Catch us in early wires, open the door
These rappers is scared as hell
What you frontin' for, he got his entourage
He got his bag of weed, it's just the way it is
Little Bizzy takes the lead

[Chorus]
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
That's how we play..

[Verse 3]
Whatever, whatever, we got to get cheddar, I'm better with money
Been runnin' around with a gun and a skully
And yo one of my buddies not dippin' the swisher in honey and uhhh
Nobody's the best and you better believe it
And leave it alone, 'lone
I'm a tell y'all all my secrets, son of a mistress, carry on
Out of the foster home been raised all of my freaky ways
Burn my collection of porn but I don't want no strays
What about church folk stressin' that I should change
Live your life I'm a live my life
Without the lies and let me pray for change
And I keep the pimp cup, I don't wanna blow the pimps up
Cause my fathers father was pimpin'
And he left all of his children checkin'
I don't have to respect it, and you don't have to respect it
Give me my space, and I'm a give you yours
It's my profession nigga, it ain't a game
Y'all can pop the collar, it'd be some drama in the parkin' lot
Seventh sign poppin' your column
One for the money, holla
Two for the deep, playas
It's the way we play impalas nigga y'all can (?)

[Chorus-Until fade]
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah (that's how we play...)
It's how we play, yeah
That's how we play..
