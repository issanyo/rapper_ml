I'ts another studio rap production
Let's do this baby
Please believe it
Another studio rap (seventh sign) production
(You know how it goes) all the time baby
Yeah, hmmm

[Hook]
Yeah, where would I be without my niggas
I love my niggas, I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never fight my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life
All my niggas, I love my niggas
I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never bite my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life (all my life)

[Verse 1]
Let the caprice blow, sunroof
Roll in the wind, sippin on something saucy
Smokin on something so fit
Reppin the seven to the fullest
Give me bullets and clips, niggas is trippin on me
I can like the kid its a bitch, but when I needs my niggas
I hope they don't fall off
This is as real as it gets
Who gonna see if he saw
I've been guerilla stomped, turned into a killa from that
I seen his family, damn glad that I had my strap
Because I went about it
And I don't talk about it, shot so many niggas
In the nineties, its a blessing they didn't find me
I could floss if I wanna nigga
Fuck your bitch
That bitch a manimal
Back up a (?) so I could dick
Fuck curteous, do you think I'm stupid
Punk bitch
I understand you put it on Capo Confuscious
I don't give a fuck about no Ruthless
I never talk about Bone
Get your thug on, pass the hennesey and

[Hook]
They got me without my niggas
I love my niggas, I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never fight my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life
All my niggas, I love my niggas
I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never bite my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life (all my life)

[Verse 2]
She got a solo artist, so I do solo shit
That's just the way it is
You like the way that the money's drippin
Up off the lips, word hustler
World wide, all the way to Cali
Clear to the other side (other side)
Daddies havin death raw
Bizzy the Kid, remember
That I used to hop the fence with Hope and Heather
We was kidnapped, so they gave us therapy
I used to play mouse trap
And sty psychiatristy stares at me
A new millenium, and yes I'm old school
All religion, and shit you need when your family was
All locked up in prison
It's like forgetting Pac
Everyone forgot Jock, don't trust my nigga T-Roc (T-Roc)
I've been in Los Scandulous in the tree tops
Niggas blowin blood as the cherry lime six four drop
Side to side with the lean and the door sole back
That's how we drive when another person's comin back
You better believe it

[Hook]
Where would I be without my niggas
I love my niggas, I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never fight my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life
All my niggas, I love my niggas
I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never bite my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life (all my life)

[Verse 3]
You better believe it, ain't no fairy tale
Don't nobody pay my motherfuckin bail
I'm going to jail, with a stomach full of hennesey
Ecstasy pills only do it once, you only live once
For real, fuck it snort the cocaine
Give me a drink right out the bottle, if you give me a germ
It ain't nothin my girl can't swallow, cause it's the first of the word
Is this the crossroads, you niggas is lost souls
I am in the arrow stuck in the crossbow
Suckered to many things, I did it but all on my own
Liquor, was always loaded, but niggas was always gone
Don't need me no sheisty shit, don't need me no feisty bitch
Niggas is (?) fuck cause she'll murder you with the quietness
She'll murder you with the quietness!

[Hook]
Where would I be without my niggas
I love my niggas, I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never fight my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life
All my niggas, I love my niggas
I can do it all alone
But your my, I would never bite my niggas
I hype my niggas, just continue right my niggas
Your all my life (all my life)
