Beat brothers...

Yeah, turn up them vocals, turn up them vocals for me, yeah
Turn them vocals up for me, I send shots out to the Bone
Thug-n-Harmony crew, yeah, I'll always love you souldiers
Right now, time to do what I need to do, representative
Praise God, believe that, give it to 'em youngin'

See I was born in the womb, beatin' down my mom's walls
Now in the nineties, you can find me makin' a chronic call
Definitely I needed a blunt to fill it up with some bud
East double '99 for life ain't none of 'em fuckin' with us
(I know) there I was with the thugs, bustin' and pullin' out
Broke ass guns, tryin' a muck my way, hey, I'll pistol wip 'em
Shit, I'm still number one, runnin' the clique and buckin' with 'em
Oumpin' don't up and let the regime get dumb I'll go with 'em
Bitchefied chant, Bizzy up in your city, ready to dance
With those itchy ass hands, and is he on the off ramp
Just cause he's thuggin', shit this music got me soft tramp
Even my cousin's buggin', but I don't give a fuck I'm puffin'
(?) that house's in Bizzy's mouth
I made it and they hate it, that's the way the ball bounce
They're gonna make the money, as for my baby son
With a creation in my life, I know he's a thug
And there I was, messin' with the thugsta Lay..
With Flesh workin' feedin' the family in the C-L-E-V-E-L-A...
Better believe indeed I got somethin' up under my sleeve
Connected to the... when I get thought let's grow some trees
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could smoke on forever, ain't it true that I do
I could feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
Remember when my neighbor Linda let a brother eat a meal
Learned to fight off my back, on my own did I struggle
In the limb of my hustle, tryin' to piece on out the puzzle
Nobody knows when we'll die, it's still maintain's through the rough
I'll be the first to give my life

So tell me who the thug... uh, uh
So tell me who the thug... uh, uh
So tell me who the thug... uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Praise God...

{Bizzy scratching}

No matter what goes down man, through the test
Through the trials and through your tribulation
I'm gonna be there with you youngin'
I'm a be there with you youngin', I said I'm a be there with you youngin
Do whatever baby, and know how we do it, grab that ego
Tell her to sit her ass down cause this is big business baby
This is big, big business

One love...
Uh, uh, uh...
One love...
Uh, uh, uh

Yes indeed, you break that old bottle baby, bring 'em the real
It's about that time

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

We gon' step off of it right now
Before I go... Praise God, in the name of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ... HOLLER!
