[Intro]
I got that, we, we together up in here man
C'mon man, we together up in here man
Jealousy breed envy, Lord guide us to this unity (get this money playa)
Enemies never been a friend to me (ain't no hatred)
Soon to be, where they wanna be
Baby we gon' make it anyway that you want (it's anyway that you want)
Cause jealousy breed envy, Lord guide us to this unity unity unity

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Cause jealousy breed envy, Lord guide us to this unity
Enemies never been a friend to me
Soon to be back, where we wanna be
Baby we gon' make it anyway that you want (it's anyway that you want)

[Bizzy Bone]
I don't sell out for no hatred, only the water conquers
Shouts out to the {?} doors, corridors and the bombers
Kamikaze we finally ready to get it poppin
Breakin 'em off a little somethin, nothin for nothin it equals nothin
Have you ever been alone? Tabernacles I have
Every paragraph I laugh, fuck her I'm out smashed (mash)
Get 'em out that paper, no one escape us, yes we comin
Heavenly angel's will they help me, I'm grindin stayin out of trouble an'
And fumblin the ball, but I'm the quarterback, coach
Sit out benched if I have to, comin back for the reproach
Take a toast to the homies, yes it's on, stay strong
One day, one way, word born, holla back
Jealousy breeds envy, Lord guide us to this unity
Enemies ain't never been no friend to me
Soon to be back where we wanna be
Baby we gon' make it anyway that you want, it's anyway that you want

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I hit 'em harder for my father, I love you when I'm alone
I'm tryna help all of our people, duck the zone, the zones
And when they take me to that special place and I'm glad they took me home
They comin to send me, never they took me, take a look and booky
The cookie crumbles, not a mumble when I speak {?}
I speak from the heart, and speak to the G's
I speak from the mind, speak from the soul, I speak wit it all
Baby I know we even, we ain't even started you know
'Til the world drop, tear us apart, leave us quick
That's that bullshit, pulpit, hit 'em up with that good whip
Cause the world tryna tear us apart, leavin 'em quick
That's that bullshit, pulpit, hit 'em up with that good whip
And the chain breakin us down (yeah)
Love breakin us down (you know what it is)
Chain breakin us down - and the chain breakin us down (Bizzy the Kid)
And the chain breakin me down (gallopin to a hood near you)
And the chain's breakin us down, the chain breakin us down down

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Seven times seventy, heavenly, melodically
Remedy, talkin that brainwave centipede
Elementary dear Watson, spark the light bulb often
I'm better off in a coffin, it'll be her caught in an orphan
The mighty fuckin warrior, wa-wa-wa-warrior
Two different floors, bet yours I'm the matrix at its finest
And wine it gets sipped on, attitude it gets dripped on
The thought's stayin gripped on, I'm quick as a bit
It's Mr. Misfit, with the fifth smokin the crisp
With water let me tell you what a lift (hey)
It's Mr. Misfit, with the fifth and smokin the crisp
With water let me tell you what a lift
And the chain breakin us down down (down)
The chain breakin us down
And the chain breakin me now
And the chain's breakin us down, the chain breakin us down down

[Chorus]
