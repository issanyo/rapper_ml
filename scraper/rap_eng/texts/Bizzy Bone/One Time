[Intro/Interlude: Bizzy]
Show 'em how we play, show 'em how we play (w-w-w-w-warriors)
Show 'em how we play, show 'em how we play
We play (cause we are warriors, warriors)
That's how we play-ay, that's how we play we play (cause we are warriors)
Show 'em how we play (walk us through the corridor, warrior, warrior)
Show 'em how we play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
(Walkin through the corridor, walkin through the corridor)
Show 'em how we play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (warrior, warrior, warriors)
Show 'em how we play-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
(Walkin through the corridor, cause we're the warriors)
Show 'em how we playyyyyyyyyy
(Cause we're the warriors, walkin through the corridor, corridor)

[Chorus 4X: Bizzy Bone]
It's only one - get deep in the word and deep in the herb
And deep in the woods and peep out the birds
Don't sleep on us, don't sleep on us (it's only, it's only)
Don't sleep on us, don't sleep on us (it's only, it's only one)

[Bizzy Bone]
Local on the wings takin flight gettin mo' major
What is it they gonna love me, they gonna shove me
Never a stranger to danger playa
They better remember that to the coldest winters pimp hand
Slippin ain't never an option, I get the trippin
Flip when they dip when they skippin
They say to the other side, let it roll, let it go, let me ride
As we park on the other side, for the moment
And the Lord provides, so potent, heh
Like the omni-potent, I'm the greatest, youknowhatI'msayin?
Now we duckin in sins, sinful livin, baby let that sinnin begin
See ain't we dirty rags, and ain't we dirty bags
Pretty in the rugged rough, pretty enough to sip that Henn'
Drift back in, move back in, wit 'em again, sick enough
Can we bring it quick enough? Now tell me is that slick enough...
Cause I know I wasn't good enough, and I know they sneakin a peek
Don't let 'em drown me, oh dear Lord
I think they're drunkards and I'm a freak - stay close
Look at the cookie crook, but I love them all the same and yes I'm grateful
How could they be so fuckin hateful? (hateful)

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro: Bizzy]
It's only one...
It's only, it's only one {*echoes*}
It's only, it's only, it's only, it's only one {*echoes*}
It's only, it's only, it's only, it's only one {*echoes*}
It's only, it's only, it's only, it's only one {*echoes*}
