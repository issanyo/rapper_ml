(Now here's in your living room)
(Mac Mall and Little Bruce)
(Boss Mac, mayne)
(Uh huh)

My bitch feeling flighty
I get up in her psyche
Squeeze my [?] tightly
And pull another [?]
Switch a bitch like academic [?]
And enjoy Nikes
[?] two women is dykey
But they like me
So we gettin' hyphy
Sistas doin' sistas
Backwoods, no Swishers
Aliens [?] visitor
Mackin' to my niggas
But you can call me Mister
Mac to the Future
Process to pursue a game
From the sewer
For the Treal TV viewers
Easy maneuver
[?]
You just trying to fuck
I'm trying to touch
Big bucks, no whammys
I'm the most like Miami
[?] can't understand me
[?]
[?] candy
And I don't even like sweets
But nigga, my game so deep

[Chorus: Little Bruce]
Bitch you owe me 'cuz you know me
[Sell another 40?]
I ain't tryin' to be ya homey
Thizz Pimpin' ain't phony
[?]
That's why the bitches [?]
See I'm fire like Backwoods stogies

Lou-Thizz Farrakhan
Nation of Thizzlandam
Tommy gun weigh about 10 tons
I'm tryin' to burn down Babylon

Mackin' Mallennium
Killer Crestside slum alum
Where I'm from we troublesome
You get hung by a young dumb dumb
Ya fuckin' bum, we stay on one
We come down when kingdom come
Chemical Ali, Qaddafi's son
Nuclear bomb got my body on numb
Backwoods beating my lungs like drum
And rum
151 I swung, no chaser
Me no run
Groove spun
But we ain't done

[Chorus repeats until fade out]
