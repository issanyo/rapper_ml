There it go
(One more time)
See they didn't think I was gonna come back
Ya' know
(One more time)
Foolish mortal

[Verse 1]
Hundred-carat mouthpiece, boss game
Crowned prince of the street
Hustlers love me like I'm dope money clean
I'm God's gift to pimp shit
There is no other than me
A prophet, a Mac Messiah
Turn water to Hennessey
With disciples that protect my title
With assault rifles
And rain ammo, 40 nights if I go
And I can see the Holy Ghost
When I light green dope
I am the son
The Father put me here to save square souls
Let he who is without sin
Cast the first stone
False prophets fuck you mind
And tell you ballin is wrong
If you wanna get bread
Gon' and get ya paper on
But give thanks
I'll be your guidance in the world so cold
Break bread wit my niggas
Make sure we all eat
But I always knew that Judaist fool
Would double cross me
They didn't give the sucka 13 pieces of silver
They sold the maggot dreams of platinum
And he bit, Stupid-ass nigga!

[Hook]
Can I get a witness, for Mac Jesus (I, I wanna)
Resurrected with the street Testament (I, I wanna)
So light the blunt and take a hit in my name
Now that I'm back, don't you wanna be saved (I wanna be saved)
Mac Jesus!
Can I get a witness, for Mac Jesus (I, I wanna)
Resurrected with the street Testament (I, I wanna)
So get 'cha loot and never show no shame
Now that I'm back, don't you wanna be saved (I wanna be saved)
Mac Jesus!

[Verse 2]
Now when the rollers came to get me
I was high as a kite
You see I knew this was my fate
I did not beg for my life
They stripped me naked
And made me wear rags
And murdered every man and woman
Who believed in Mackin-Ass
Told my followers I was phony
Mall don't come with the raw
He ain't the one and only son
Of Mac-Allah
Took off the rim I had on
Replaced it with a crown of thorns
Think they take me out the game
But man they really ain't knowin'
Now as I sit on the cross
My fate is sealed, or so the thought
Told my mother save her tears
Cause this is world is lost
There I am next to a killer and thief
All because I laced the land
With G-A-M-E (the thief said...)
The thief said "if you the shit
Jump off the crucifix
You ain't the kid of the Mac-God
How you be dissed like this?"
But the killer thought different
Knew my words was true
Said "I'm a sinner but I'm willing to change
If I could come with you"
I told him "Soldier don't worry
I promise when ya pass
You'll meet the King of All Mackin
And live life lav"
As I felt myself going a light hit my face
It was my father
Told me the struggles that I been through
Wasn't a waste
Then I smiled and said " Pops
I'm ready to come home"
After I died they wrapped me up
And my friends and fans mourned
But Allah, motherfucker!
Cause seven days later
I'm resurrected to the game
To bless young playas!
Mac Jesus!

...And open up your pockets!
...And give it up!
Praise the Lord!
Somebody's been talking about me, talking about
I've been riding around in a Cadillac! (What??)
If you love me, and you wanna give to me
Then I should be in a Rolls- Royce!! (Yeah!!)

[Hook]

I, I wanna
I, I wanna
I, I wanna be saved
