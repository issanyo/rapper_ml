[Intro: Mac Mall]
Macn
Comin’ through cutthroat crazy, you feel me?
("You know my steez")

[Verse 1: Mac Mall]
I got astrophysic pimp shit, that gifted authentic misfit
Trip like lifted, crack helmets, some cutthroats get rich
The Crestside I’m committed and all my biscuits got extendeds
If I’m within it, we split, with the quickness
Leave no witness, out in boonies diggin’ ditches
In Bay waters, sleep with fishes, knock your teeth out with some wrenches
Won’t be ID‘d by no dentist, your own mama won’t know who you be
I murder mac from Triple-C, hell, I have been 707, Crestside cutthroat cuddie, yee
Yee ‘til all my cuts free
‘Til we ain’t gettin’ on them triggers, puttin’ fuck niggas to sleep
‘Til them bitches pop that pussy for a real nigga like me
On my level, don’t trip, muthafucka, I’m Kool Keith
On my level, don’t trip, muthafucka, I’m Kool Keith
Follow me now, fuck around and you’ll be layin’ six feet deep
Man, straight mobbin’ with the heat
And you niggas know my steez

[Chorus]
I stay steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
And if it’s ‘bout the cash, then I’mma seize the moment
Now that’s steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
And if it’s ‘bout the cash, then I’mma seize the moment
Now that’s steezin’ on ‘em

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
The slicker the talk on pimpers to poles
The quicker she get off the liquor and bowl
The quicker she kick off her shoes and the clothes
And that’s how we turn ‘em like Zeniths and vogues
Bitch, you gon’ learn what it meant when you chose
Trick, I’m a permanent pimp in a zone
Bet I’m gon’ earn me a bill ‘fore I’m gone
Nothin’ concern me, I’m permanently on
Thoroughly gone, killin’ for riches like Sierra Leone (thoroughly gone)
Thoroughly gone, leave ‘em in ditches, they buried with chrome
Me and my niggas is all that we listen to, all that we on
We fought for them figures and that’s why triggers be callin’ you home
Picture a nigga who live what he spit when he come from the turf
Fuck all these snakes, I’m a mongoose, I’m on you, I come from the dirt
All of these bitches is liars, most of these niggas is too
None of you niggas is riders, none of you bitches is true
Ray ain’t no front, I check ‘em for breakfast, I break ‘em for brunch, make ‘em pay for

A lunch
A winner for dinner, I do what I say and I say what I want
The 7-O-Savage, don’t get it, we got it, I can’t even front
I rap ‘til I die, I only take one ‘til the end of the blunt

[Chorus]
I stay steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
And if it’s ‘bout the cash, then I’mma seize the moment
Now that’s steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
Steezin’ on ‘em
And if it’s ‘bout the cash, then I’mma seize the moment
Now that’s steezin’ on ‘em
