[Verse 1: Mac Mall]
Sometimes I sit alone and seek into my thoughts
Thinking about the game and how much cocaine is bought
By these fucking fiends, so instead of going broke
I had the cot to pop, so watch a youngster go loc
I hit the fucking strip like a savage
Sell after sell now I am living kind of lavish
I ain't no high-roller but on a steady rise
And the strip is getting crowded so a youngster had to strive
I'm only on the first fucking level of the game
Me and my cuddies on the ave selling 'caine
Thinking about the day that my business will excel
But I need more fiends, more product, more mail
So me and my cuddies plan on a move
To the other side of town where the 'caine flow is cool
It was kind of smooth how we hit they fucking block
Selling hella rocks, ain't thinking about getting caught
It's enough for man start to notice the come-up
It's just a matter of time before the first nigga run up
I said, 'It's cool man we out here for peace
We ain't tripping off y'all niggas cause there's money in these streets'
But word on the turf is, for funk, these niggas ready
Cause they telling all the fiends me and my cuddies sell Betty
I'm mad as fuck so they task me to get my mask
Drive past and bust a cap up in a nigga ass
This is how it went down where they at I'm curious
I'm rubbing on my gat, the gin got me delirious
I see him in a circle in a crowd rolling dice
Shit was nothing nice how I took my life to vice
BOOM BOOM, tricks duck and realize I'm capping
Couple of fools to the ground, they found out what happened
It ain't no stop for what I do for my riches
I'm watching niggas catching hot ones, screaming like bitches
And they going to wonder what is this
An 'eye-for-a-mother-fucking-eye' when I'm doing illegal business

[Chorus 2X]
(KRS-One: Illegal business controls America) *scratches*

[Verse 2: Mac Mall]
And after the funk, I think I best'a pack heat
Cause fools be getting smoked on these inner city streets
About a week later, man, these fools want vengeance
I was kicking it up on the block and heard a '40 Chevy engine
This must be the hit, so now I run for cover
Mad as fuck cause these fools want to get me on the under
Nathan really happened, just some capping and a casualty
A smoked-out fiend on the block, he used to work for me
Shit was kind of sick, about the fiend, man, I say 'fuck him'
He tripping off the rocks that he had that's why they bucked him
Now it seems the rollers want to stop me, want to jock me, always hanging around my block, G
And they got my boy stressing especially when they took me down for questions
But I said a little drama, saying that my grandmama live out here I came out just to see her
And now I know I got to get ghost tho
Cause I don't want the po-po to kick down my door
So before I leave I got a trick up my sleeve
I grab the Glocks, the maps, and the uzi machines
But can't forget the .380
So watch a young ass nigga go crazy
I found out who was calling the shots
Knocked on his front door (BOOM)
Now that's one mother fucker popped
Went to his grindin' spot
Saw five punk fools in the parking lot
They didn't understand how we drop the top
So a fool tried to run, so we shot
And as soon as we tried to get up out of there
Saw the rollers and cars and coppers, man, everywhere
That's what we get, fucked up on a hit
Gotta stay on your motherfucking toes when you're doing illegal business

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mac Mall]
So now I'm chilling like a mother fucking villain in a jail cell
Post bail cause my attorney knew the judge well
So the state sent the D.A. to get me
The rollers ran in my house and found a half-a-ki'
My lawyer said, 'If things don't go as planned
They could send a nigga down for straight life, man'
So I blame it on society
Cause if life would have been better for me, I wouldn't slang D
But that's beside the point
Think about my case as I fire up the doja joint
My lawyer called and said 'forget about the rocks in your residence
The junkie just turned state evidence'
Damn! And now I'm in a real shock
Because a fiend that used to work for me hooked up with the cops
I gotta think of a plan
Don't want to be washed like Tide
Pay off the D.A. and now he's on my side
So on the first day of court I sit there like a mac and watch the D.A. fuck up the facts
At the end of the trial the judge sentenced me to 4, huh
But I'm only doing 2 tho
Just some time to get my game straight
And figure out where I'm gon' be relocating
Don't trip cause I will be out in a few
So look me up in a ghetto near you
Doing straight illegal business
