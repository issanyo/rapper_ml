[Chorus:]
My team is throwin' up T'z
Cutthroat, cuttys, and beezys
Thizz worldwide like a [?]
Everybody's dumbin' on somethin'
Some of them dudes stupid doo-doo
Some of them dudes is doin' a fool
Some of them dudes off mushrooms
Some of them dudes took two in orange juice

Cool when you cause a cutthroat condition, pimpin'
Turn it up cause we pillin' in the building
So thizz with us, that Crestside way
