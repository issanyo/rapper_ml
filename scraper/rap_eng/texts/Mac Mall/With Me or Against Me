Some say the [?? ---- fell out ??] 'cause niggas get skunked out
Cowards we buck 'em down shoot the chooper in the ground
Muggin' with evil frown got heat nigga what's up now
Let off a hundred rounds guaranteed to shut your mouth
Some say we need to be locked up in penitentaries
I say kill off police and district attorneys
Public offenders too, they all be in cahoots
Cut them from ear to ear let 'em die in plug poos
Must not forget the judge so long I helped his grudge
With a rusty box cutter cut off his nuts
Though they might call us nuts I do not give a fuck
I hit that po'po' once then come mista monsta dump
To all the black police: I want to see you bleed
Nigga ya still a nigga that's on the wrong team
Sometime I hate the world want to kill up everythang
Maybe it's hallucinagenics fuckin' with my mind frame
The question's in head tellin' me don't trust my friends
Don't crush my cans so in my ruger I can [?? bend ??]
But then again what if this motha fucka jammed
Then I fall and will the lord know who I am?
Probably not because I'm livin' life by the fault
So off hellfire I blaze the blunt with me or against me
Ugh
My bitch don't understand she think it's just a phase
I hear her cry at night hopin' that one day I change
Can't tell her that I love her when I lust the game
Tryin' to keep my composure but yet I'm untamed
Listen I hear the streets call my name
The same way they called my father in his day and that nigga came
It's tradition, though my mama raised me as a Christian
I still [?? roll in terms of low ??] with devilish intentions
Poppin' [?? shit out ??] but didn't nobody listen
On my way six feet under the ground or up in state prison
If so then in my book let it be written
A youngster did his fuckin' thang without pretendin'
Preacher think I'm cursed because I seldom go to church
I went through five-hundred boys doin' major dirt
Grandmama say the other night she had a dream
That I was laid off in a coffin after faulty scene
Looked at me said look baby you know what that mean?
That you can catch death tryin' to chase after green
And everybody ain't your partner so [?? - ---- --- ---- ??]
'cause fools will leave your ass for dead and don't trip
Am I crazy?  Tell me am I really insane?
Is it strange 'cause I feel the pain corruptin' my brain?
I need a head shrink because I'm startin' to think
I'll turn the barrel on myself and take a long sleep
Baptised by my heat, take my own self out the game then maybe then I can rest in peace
Fuck [??] fools that want to see my on my back
With my mama cryin' over me dressed in all black
I'm drinkin' conyak poppin' hella prozak
It's harder everyday to keep my sanity intact
I'm takin' ritlan smokin' on that rope again
All type of mani shit that try to calm the beast within
I think I need to pray maybe that' do some good
Do God got some time for niggas in the hood?
Cain't win for losin' who the hell do I think I'm foolin'?
Voices in my dome I think I start to listen to 'em
Tellin' me to pull the trigger fool don't be no punk
And I ain't no punk so I blast I don't give no fuck
