[Mac Mall talking to muffled man]
Ha, yeah, Mr. Big
I know you’re an important man and I’m glad you took time out your schedule to meet with me like this
I promise to be brief ‘cause I’m aware you’re a very busy man
You and your kind have grew wealthy off the blood, sweat and tears of me and mine
But fuck that
Right now, this is judgement day
Yeah, the revolution is right in your muthafuckin’ face
Save the shit and cut the crap, ‘cause I ain’t tryna hear all that
Dig this, you vicious piece of jelly:
From now on, I’m cutting you out
This is our business, my business
Yeah, my Legal Business
*gunshots*
