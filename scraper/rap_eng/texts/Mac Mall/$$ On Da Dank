[Verse 1]
Take a big hit, straight to your lungs
A fat spliff, but nigga can you fuck with one?
It’s the dank, the shit that have a nigga daze-y
Kinda hazy, you know, straight crazy
I got some raps and a track that I could flow to
I need some dank and I know who I can go to
To my potna, the one with the fat sacks
I get a personal pack and then I’m at that
It ain’t that I’m addicted on it
But the way it have me bein’ just make me want it
You know a nigga gots to give his props to the alcohol
But the dank is the shit for young Mac Mall
Or maybe it’s the fuckin’ dog in me
That make grab a pack of zags and MD 20/20
Nah, I better switch that to gin
‘Cause once that I get in she gon’ wish I never been
But see, I guess it’s just a side effect
When you smokin’ on the dank wit' my tape in ya deck
It’s like that when I’m full of marijuana, ‘cause I’mma
Make ya bitch feel way hotter than a sauna
Full of the dank, the Taylor, the zesty
Puffin’ on the dank in the Crest is where the best be, see
It’s a muthafuckin’ family thang, and that’s how we hang
‘Cause even Kool had a muthafuckin’ gang
Tell me that, I’m slammin’ in ya car again
Smokin’ dank just like a fuckin’ Rastafarian
Kick back, playa, hear what I’m sayin’
Because can’t nathan stop me, mane, when I’m dankin’ and drankin’

[Chorus]
I know you got some money on the dank, nigga (3x)
What’s up? Fire up
I know you got some money on the dank, nigga (3x)
What’s up? Muthafucka, fire up

[Verse 2]
I been a chronic alcoholic since the days of O-L-D
Crackin’ the 40s wit my muthafuckin’ homies
Me and P.U.G, we hit the strip, uh oh
Sippin’ on gin and juice with the flow, I’m tore
I’m drinkin’ like a maniac although my stomach’s empty
But to me and my SES gettin’ ripped comes strictly
A 40, I was sippin’ one, ‘fore I was really grippin’ one
I’m way too young to drink, my potnas elders get me one
I sip on E&J, I thought the Hennessey was famous
Pass a pint of gin and watch a nigga act like Dayness
See that’s a SES shot to my Crew Thang cuddie
T. Love, Short and Sleep, them my alcoholic buddies
Moms tellin’ me to slow down, ‘cause I’m always tore down
She knew it was on, the first day I found out I didn’t need a ID
The C-O-P and gin gettin' soundin’ good to me
Sometime the drank make a nigga homicidal
‘Cause fools they get nauseous when I come to this recital
Of the Mac Mall lyrics to your dome, mane
Slam it in your box or your deck or your home, mane
So don’t trip if it slip ‘cause you know it’s on hit
So watch these niggas tighten up on they bitch, when I come like this
You can’t get with me, even if I was tipsy
I blast Handsome Town, as if my name was Filthy Phil
But on the real, sucka, take a dose
Of the pimpin’ ass playa that’s sessin’ the most
And I’m the nigga that the tricks be hatin’
‘Cause I act a muthafuckin’ fool, when I’m dankin’ and drankin’

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Dankin’ and drankin’, a real cool thang that I love to do
With my crew, I got no time to be trippin’ off fools
Who love to run up when they alcohol level way too high
That shit ain’t fly, yeah, that’s how fools die
But niggas still drink and drain go off a little quicker
Steady getting courage from the liquor
But I know the next we gon’ be homies
Yeah, I got drank in my system, so is it gettin’ kinda lonely?
So if you see me, creepin’ through the Crest land
Fire up, ‘cause I’m lookin’ for the doja man
Smokin’ on dry, me love to get high
Me fuck with the dank ‘til the day that me die
Love E&J and doja, call me, man, I’m sober
The drank make me want to put a fool in a coma
Fuck with the dank ‘cause it keeps me kinda peaceful
Fire up with Big John, get dank with DJ Cee, so
Drank got me sprung, dank got me hooked
Me live in the Crest with the playas and crooks
Much love to young Dubee, and Mac D-R-E
Strictly dankin’ and drankin’ got me feelin’ irie

[Chorus]
