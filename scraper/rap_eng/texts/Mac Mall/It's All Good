[Verse 1]
I be what is known as a soldier out to make a mint
Keepin' the crowd pumped like I was Folder, ask yo bitch
Mall is in the house for '92, 90-fuckin-3
Keepin' the suckas stressin' off my Strictly SES Faculty
Never needs no pipe, when ya fuckin with some dope like this
I got the fools trippin', the hoes, niggas, and the tricks
Be askin' whats the aspects of a young playas game
Sufferin' through playa stress, pimpin' through the snow and rain
The sleet and on them mothafuckin' sunny days
Stayin' on my toes like I was told by young Mac Dre
I said in the last I'mma savage when I go up in 'em
Never thought yo' hoe be bendin' over for the next nigga
Love to hit the dank, can't fuck with that Qaddafi
Since I'm comin' viscious, man, these niggas wanna pop me
But I just keep the game tight, you know, like a playa should
Just load the clip up, 30 rounds, fool, then it's all good

Then it's all good
It's all good
It's all good
You know it's all good
Check this shit out

[Verse 2]
I'm hearin' hella mothafuckas tryna be actin', runnin' at the mouth
Thinkin' they can fuck with a youngster, fool, I got some doubts
How you gon' step and the fact, it's already known
I need to put the latex on my mic, I've fucked so many times
Bringin' the suckas home, I'm not ya average singer
Get a middle finger, I pulled the millimeter
I wouldn't wanna be ya, the electric shock'll see ya
Peep the little red dot then you'll pop, YEAH
The rollers wanna hem me at the station
They trippin' like they basin, mad as fuck 'cause we poppin' across the nation
I gotsta send love to Mac Dre and Young Kilo
Feds tried to fade, but soon y'all gon' be free tho
And much indo gon' be lit when y'all hit the strip
Game don't stop from the Crest BIATCH!
It's all good

That's right, it's all good, muthafucka
They don't hear me though
It's all good
It's all good

(Hey potna, where you from, mayne?)
Who me?

[Verse 3]
Straight Sawyer Street dwella, fly young fella
Got the pimp takin' they bitch because they know that I got hella
Game and Mall's the name, man, these fools don't wanna fuck with me
Should I slang the D, or come up on the R-A-P
I love the M-A-C, cuddie, may you rest in peace
I eats a big feast after smokin' dank with DJ Cease
Fila's on my feet, I'm sharp like a khaki crease
Some playas think I'm diznope, some Erk-n-Jerk and Kiznoke
In my fuckin' lungs, I got the doja dank smiznoke
Sometimes I get liznoke, I sit outside criznazy
I pack a Tiznec niznine 'cause fools be tryna spriznay me
I was at the telly, with this hoe named Kelly
Had the Iznerk and the Jiznerk and a siznack of that mellie
The hoe was kinda siznick, all up on my diznick
And since she love the SES I got some cuddie she can get wit'
These fools don't understand because the game got chepa
I'm the telly room keepa, the through-your-window creepa
Its playas in the SES, I thought you knew
You do what you gotta do, as long as you pay my crew
It's all good

It's all good (Repeats until end)

(Get your hand off my leg...Get your leg off my hand)
