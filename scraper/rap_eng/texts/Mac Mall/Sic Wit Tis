[Verse 1]
Turn up the beat and let me come wit’ some game, mane
Talkin’ about these hoes who be tryna claim to fame, mane
But it’s a waste of time, because Mac Mall ain’t no celebrity
I’m just a playa wit’ some G-A-M-E
But that ain’t it, ‘cause I’m servin’ the dick
To the hoes who got the tape and straight lovin’ the shit
That pimp shit that slams, niggas runnin’ scams
And how to make a faithful bitch cheat on her man
Plus that doja dank and the candy paint
And the way-cool bottle of E&J that I drank
And when I’m on that shit, you can’t level with me
I’m havin’ church hoes think I got the devil in me
It ain’t over, fool, it gets doper
When I’m freakin’ yo’ hoe up on a sofa
Legs all open like a TV antenna
‘Cause a nigga get wild when I’m goin’ up in her
What’s really goin’ on when ya leave home?
My late nights hella hype every time ya gone
You better lock yo’ bitch up and got to sleep wit’ ya gat
‘Cause if she page me, then man I’m at that (through the window)
And all I need is just one beat
And I’mma pick ya bitch up when ya sleep
‘Cause I’m sic wit’ this

Sic wit this, sick with this, I’m sic wit this
You know how that go, fuck the next nigga hoe
Ha ha, it’s all good though

[Verse 2]
I see a gang a muthafuckas lettin’ they hoes wear the drawls and shit
Punk ass niggas tryna hog a bitch
Them fools roll around takin’ they hoes on dates
Suckas like that love to playa hate
When I see they hoe and say ‘What’s up?’
Spit a little game and now I’m wreckin’ the guts
I got the bitch at the telly and she got way wild
Had the trick on Erk-n-Jerk and she got way foul
Startin’ talkin’ that bein’ my lady shit
Sayin’ we can hook up on a relationship
I said ‘Relationships? Now them is way too expensive, though
Fuck bein’ sprung, I just wanna break ya, hoe’
You found out and you damn near shitted
Can’t believe your main bitch did it
But you should know, that that’s the wrong hoe
For you to act hella funny, man, and fall for
And when she hear this tape, she gon’ hate this
Probably even wish I never made this
But the shit I spit is real so I had to
I’m tired of seein’ weak niggas who talked bad to
By a period-havin’, stank pussy, yeast infection, no-money tramp bitch
‘Always wanna know where I’m at’ bitch
And what I’m sayin’, you should stop bein’ like a sucka
And leave her stranded at the telly and say ‘Fuck her’
And then bump you the next bitch
You should be about your money, potna
And be sic wit this

Ha ha, you know what I’m sayin’?
So sic, so sic, so sic, so sic
Sic wit this
You know these niggas be trippin’, man, playa hatin’ themselves wit’ one bitch. A bitch ain’t shit, you need to get some money in your pocket, you know what I’m sayin’?
Sheeit, fuck that bitch, mane
She just a little ol’ hoe, you know what I’m sayin’? Be real about yours, it’s ’93
You know what I’m sayin’? But check this shit out for these niggas

[Verse 3]
Sic wit this, that’s how these fools be tryna be actin’
Poppin’ at the mouth, hate to see me mackin’
Ain’t no trippin’ in my pimpin’, so it’s funny how they love to hate
The pimpin’ ass youngsta comin’ up in The Bay, muthafucka
So back up off the dick of a youngsta
Tryna say I ain’t on hit, you can miss me with that shit
Because I’m known to spit the game that have these hoes ‘noid
‘Cause nann bitch wit’ a pussy should be unemployed
But when we first meet, I give ya full respect
I’d be the sweetest muthafucka that ya ever met
But don't think I’mma stop doin’ scandalous shit
I’m takin’ mail, food stamps, check, even WIC, bitch
And on the microphone I’m way too vicious
So niggas watch ya hoes
‘Cause I’m sic wit this

That’s right, that’s right. Man, these hoes is hella sick
But now, these muthafuckas — hoes ain’t shit but these niggas decide to trip, you know what I’m sayin’? Takin’ that shit too far
It’s ’93, you supposed to break a hoe and bust a hoe, you know what I’m sayin’?
But uh — and about these bitches, though, wanna get a nigga wit' paper. But, uh, nah, you better get another caper, ‘cause we out here tryna do this shit
The SES Faculty ain’t goin’ for that shit
You could be a SES hoe and get the Crest, though, you know what I’m sayin’? Bitch

Sic wit this, so sic wit this, this young Crest playa is sic wit this
Many hoes, many hoes, all sic wit this
Wanna get with this young playa ‘cause I’m sic wit this
So sic wit this, sic wit this
Sic wit this, so sic wit this
Loc’ed out, yeah, ha ha, MVP, yeah
Sawyer Street, bitch
Get rich, get rich
