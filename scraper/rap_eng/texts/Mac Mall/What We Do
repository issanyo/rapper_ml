[Intro]
Ay, check this out, right, who we got in here, cuddie?
We got the Romper muthafuckin’ Room in this muthafucka
Crew Thang and the Five-Trey-Fizzive
Strictly SES, straight from the muthafuckin’ Crest
That’s right. Mac muthafuckin’ Dre is in this
Coolio, you know, Da’Unda’Dogg
That’s right. Mac muthafuckin’ Mall
And the Sugawolf Pizzimp
Not the pimp…what about PSD a/k/a Stevie D, bitch
Oh, y’all didn’t know?
This is what we do…

[Verse 1: Coolio Da’Unda’Dogg]
My lyrical flow got me dwellin’ up on the past
Servin’ ‘em on that ass, gettin’ my cash, comin’ up fast
And’ll blast you in a minute, drama, quick to jump up in it
So end it ‘fore you begin it ‘cause I’m down to represent it
And’ll send you higher to your Messiah once I open fire
At your own desire I’ll flat you like a tire
Wire me a kite if you full of fright, that electric sight
Ain’t no joke, niggas be comin’ up short thinkin’ they gonna fight
Talkin’ about that weed, servin ‘em sacks of indo; what you need?
All of my homies keyed, niggas free from the life of greed
Twisted up on the mixes, won’t you fix us niggas somethin’ to drank
Can’t get enough dizank up out the bizank, got put in my tank
Bitches be wantin’ my riches and they bitches, man, be jockin’ my switches
Pullin’ around my riches which is cool
Because I get ‘em, and then I hit ‘em
You see this what we do when we doin’ what we do

[Verse 2: Mac Dre]
She wants to get married but I ain’t and I cain’t
‘Cause I’m sprung on my muthafuckin’ dank and some drank
I got a fat bank, huh, and still break hoes
And if your bitch gets to jockin’, I will break yours
The Mac named Dre from the C-R-E-S-T
Ask about a nigga and they all would say ‘Yes, he’s the shizit’
I gizit, much pussy on my dizick
Never would I lizick or pay like a trizick
I’m like that, potna, I thought you heard
Fuckin’ with your brain like some Thunderbird
I’m doper than a joint of that potent dank
And funky like the county jail holding tank
Romper, Room, crew for life
If I thrust ya once, hoe, I’mma thrust ya twice
What is I’m sayin’ on this microphone
I get Romped out when my mic is on

[Verse 3: PSD]
I make the Statue of Liberty get freaky
Scoot her panties over, play with her pussy
Make her pay me to jook me
Playa playa, oh hell yeah, motive be to skeet her
Menage a trois, you, her and I, bubble while you G her, yeah
A Crew Thang nigga keepin’ it real
Up against it with my protégés reachin’ for mills
We puts the pussy-whip in ill fashion
And bend a corner hella squatted with that skrill flashin’
(What you squattin’?) A Mitsubishi, 2-triple-zero GT
VR 4, Nike shoe to the floor
If it’s not relatable to dollars I can’t holla
Tryna prosper, turnin’ down nothin’ but collars
That’s what we wantin’, hutch, I strut with a limp
Through the party off Bacardi with the Shug’Wolf Pimp, ugh
PS to TS, Country Club Creezest
We just gon’ tear the roof off this bitch

[Verse 4: Dubee]
Now it’s the hog in your dog speakin’ once more
Crestsidin’ through the door, and pimp a hoe more
Than them hoes they be frozen, jockin’ on a player
Hollerin’ ‘Pimp ‘til I die, runnin’ game like the mayor’
Extreme heavy hustler, stack a chip fiend
In the game of the big dogs, mutts and the fleas
But G’s like me, we pimp and don’t slack
Stack G’s for my neez, fetti fiend for the scratch
Bitch, I’m hustlin’ hard
So now they wanna put the Mac down and bogard
But I won’t let ‘em, known to sweat ‘em for the green when I mack
‘Cause I hound dog hoes and sho’ won’t slack
It’s SugaWolf Pimp in me
Nothin’ but the muthafuckin’ Mark Street G
Servin’ this game like a thang of the ‘caine somethin’ serious
Comin’ like dick, mayne, flowin’ like a period

[Verse 5: Mac Mall]
1:40 in the morning, Brougham reekin’ of the rope, see
All my cuddies high and so am I so peep game I be bold
These hoes is on some muthafuckin’ alien shit
But me and Kill-a-Hoe won’t peel a hoe, push her off a cliff
Ripped off Hennessy, trick bitch, I’ll slap ya head off
And if your nigga move, Crestsiders gon’ dump that lead off
Your man is a midget, he like to floss and trick bread off
But hoe I’m from the North and fa sho’ you gotta get off
See I’m a third generation Mac
I like my hoes hella thick like the trunk on my Cadillac
But bitches on me like Prozac
Oh, you didn’t know that little hoe was sessed out like that?

[Chorus 4X]
Bitch, I thought you knew
Comin’ straight from the Crest, this is what we do
