Stright motha fuckin game

Start this shit off with yung mac ass mall
And it's sic with this single motherfuckas

Smoke 5 up or even sniff
Kick back and relax
And turn up the beat
As I go deep into this rap and fo fill
Yo needs of every money hungrey niggas hustlin' on the strip
And every dumb yo wet pussy freakish bitch
