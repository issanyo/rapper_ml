[Verse 1]
When I first glanced at ya, I knew I had to have ya
Fly chassis with a sassy manner
She hold herself in a high standard
And hella suckers in the hood ain't never ran in her
Young tender, thoroughbred, born winner
I know you're busy, but you need to holler at your nigga
I won't scare you away with fast talk and game
I wanna know if I can have ya, but I'd start witcha name
Who you with? You say that you ain't got no mayne?
I'm tryna tell you, girl, I'll let you star on my team
A play-maker, make a player slow his pace up
The type of face a brother wanna see when he wake up
She works hard nine to five, sometimes more
Plus go to school at night, you see she got big goals
And I don't wanna bring you down, I just wanna come along
Make you moan, make a home, a place that we can both grow old
See, let this truth be told, I'm tryna leave that fast life alone
And find a woman of my own
So we can get together and build, a foundation that's real
And everyday I'll make you feel like a mill'

[Chorus: Shima & (Mac Mall repeats "You got me wide open...but you ain't even knowin'" in the background)]
You ain't knowin' that I'm wide open
You got me goin' and it's showin' that I want you
You ain't feelin' me
I'm caught up, ba-by
You got me slippin' and I'm trippin'
Off the things you do

[Verse 2:]
You think I'm runnin' drag, but I ain't even mad
I bet you all my cash I'd be the realest that you had
I wanna treat you lav', but you can't see that half
I'm tryna keep you smilin' if you just give me a chance
At times you make me laugh, you got me wide open
You think it's all a front, swear you ain't even knowin'
If I was runnin' drama on ya
I woulda been in the wind, baby, hittin' corners
Instead I'm standin' right beside you like you know I'm 'posed to
Keepin' composure, while most fools be in your face just tryna get over
I see you know my style, me and my vibe is wild
I hear your friends say I'm not trustworthy
But if you wait a while, I'd shut that madness down
Prove to you once and for all that I'm deservin'
Of your heart, your mind, your soul, your body, your time
If it's cool, boo, then give me a sign
Now I ain't tryna rush you but ASAP
Keep a Mac on your mind and holla at me
I say ain't tryna rush you but ASAP
Keep a Mac on your mind and holla at me

[Bridge: Shima]
See, I've been waitin' all my life
To find someone like you
And now that you're finally here with me
There's no time to lose
You're on my mind seven days a week
No matter what they say
'Cause even though your style is wild
I like the way you do your thing
Baby, I'm wide open, too
I'm lovin' me some you
Baby, I'm wide open, too
I'm lovin' me some you

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
