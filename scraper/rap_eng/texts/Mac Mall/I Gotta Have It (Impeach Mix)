I gots to have it
(“Ah, ya don’t stop; to the beat y’all, uh, ya don’t stop”)

[Verse 1]
I gots to keep them trippin’, the way that Mall be flippin’ the style
Suckaz still be bitchin’, player haters living foul
Hot ‘cause I’m a youngsta, strapped with the gift to gab
Some be gettin’ mad ‘cause I got the gift they never had
Leaving the fools stuck, sittin’ there with no word
Drama stays on perv, but still sendin’ ‘em to the curb
Mall from the Crestside,  V-A-double L-E-J-O
Cuddies comin’ up making mail (Alright)
But still I see the suckaz behind this thing lurkin’
For intruders, curtain, especially when I’m perkin’
Didn’t think I had it in me the way the youngsta switch it up
Cee’s got the cut, and keepin’ the suckaz mouth shut
Call the paramedics, emergency is where you’re headed
Didn’t even expect it, the way that Mall get crazy hectic
Ain’t too complicated, kept it simple and plain
Respect in this rap game, mayne
And you know I gots to have it

[Verse 2]
I gotta have it, money in my pocket keeps me rollin’ cool
A vet on triple gold ones, house, and a crazy pool
California Livin’, potna, everything’s kosher
20’s don’t get this then the 100’s gon’ hold ya
Players on the avenue out for crazy cash
Mail straight legal, fool, so trick a task
And in the system, you gots to be a P-I-M-P
‘Cause that’s the only way to get P-A-I-D
Had to keep my mail fat, fools don’t even like that
Muggin’ every time they see me striking on the track
Why is they trippin’ off a ruthless rap youngsta?
Dope with the gift to gab, game like a hustler
You gots to have mail in ’93 and that’s the realest
No matter how you’re livin’, you know you got to feel this
You gots to get paid in this day and age
Because you can’t flip a Benz under minimum wage
I gots to have it

[Hook]
(“Ah, ya don’t stop; to the beat y’all, uh, ya don’t stop”)

(“Ah, ya don’t stop; to the beat y’all, uh, ya don’t stop”)
I gots ta have it
(“Ah, ya don’t stop; to the beat y’all, uh, ya don’t stop”)

(“Ah, ya don’t stop; to the beat y’all, uh, ya don’t stop”)

{Verse 3]
Getting up on the microphone, so trip as I spit
I’m making the crowd flip ‘cause I’m sick with the hits
Yeah, though; I’m sliding like the floor show
When suckers playa hate but need to get up on this flow, you know
I’m just a young player going crazy for the cash
Zappin' for the radio, it’s strictly for the ave
I’m tired of seeing suckers tryna get with my PG
They don’t wanna see me ‘cause the style comes easy
Now you gon’ compete against the dopest youngster on the street?
Tricks be in too deep, didn’t know I play for keeps
As I creep to the mic, it’s like I’m serving the crowd double up
Sometimes I spit the ruthless rhyme that's known to start the trouble up
I’m coming up so back up off me, I’m on another level
I never zap the rock but still I pack the heavy metal
So catch me later, player, sideways in the traffic
Back to the town, cuddie, you know I gots to have it

[Interlude: Khayree]
Well, alright
That’s Mac Mall
Khayree got that funk goin’ for y’all
So check it out
