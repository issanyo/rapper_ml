(feat. Goapele)

[Mac Mall:]
Its a beautiful thang, a beautiful thang

[Goapele:]
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to

[Mac Mall:]
I swear the man upstairs musta answered my prayers when he blessed me with a woman like you
In chance I never have to ask if you're lovin the Mac cuz boo your eyes tell me that you do
And you don't ever hane to worry about your dude bein' with them fools out there loose
Cuz pretty faces come and go, but fo sho you know wifey who I come home to
Remember when they said we wouldn't last, said we moved too fast, but now they ask how they get exactly what we have
Imagine that, though the odds were stacked, you chose me as your man and you still got my back
That's why I'm on the tracks snatchin' rags gettin' scratched for the day you have my son or my daughter perhaps
Baby girl you're my future, and that's a fact
I'm a king, and my kingdom's wherever she at

[Chorus]
[Goapele:]
I can't believe I finally found someone like you
Something told me it was this one, he's the one to hold on to
He's the one
Someone to hold on to (My once in a lifetime)
Someone to hold on to (The reason to my rhyme)
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to

[Mac Mall:]
There ain't no jewels fools can buy to compare with your shine
Designer labels only hide your divine inside
And she's mine, my once in a lifetime, the reason to my rhyme
And I'm just tryin' to let you know you're my kind
You're fly and fine, beautiful best describe your being
Even haters can't deny that we're ride or die
It's us against the world, I know that I can win long as I got my baby girl
So come with me to see forever and a day
In my arms a place you'll always feel safe
I do what it takes to keep a smile on her face
And homie she down, and that's how she gonna stay

[Chorus]
[Goapele:]
I can't believe I finally found someone like you
Something told me it was this one, he's the one to hold on to
He's the one
Someone to hold on to (He's the one)
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to
Hold on

[Goapele:]
Without any doubts he walked straight into my world
I knew then that we know now what we have is once a lifetime
I know what you think, but the bells I heard them ring
Cuz you love me from within, but I need a special friend
You're the one

Someone to hold on to [x4]

It's small talk baby it's us against the world
I know that I can win long as I got my baby girl [x3]
