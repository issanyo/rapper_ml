[Intro]
The World's Freshest
You bitch

[Hook]
It's Mac Mall
And DJ Fresh
M-A-C y'all
With the world's freshest (x2)

[Verse 1]
What's happening? It's macking brought to you by world's freshest
DJ Fresh, we connect like fresh fest Crest to death
And can't no fuck boy test, I rep the west
Bay Area boss, I'll sign your check I'll get you stretch
Cutthoat slice ya neck, Crestside Columbian necktie
Gimme my respect, fuckhead, I take it
Fire to that fake shit you clowns came with
I say it's whack you say I'm hatin'...fuck it, I hate it
I hate your fairy father and the punk slut he laid with
I hate 'em both for fucking, and the bitch nigga they created
I wish that ho swallowed or you woulda been aborted
And we wouldn't have to listen to that weak shit you recorded
You tricks need to cease and desist, you're all on my hit list
Consider this a death threat not a diss
I hock loogie spit in your face, dare you to base
And if you try to come get it, pimp, 40 cal to your fitted
Ho don't get splitted, Mac the most with the shit-it
Come with uncut game, lame lyrics is (scrimmage???)
I give em that illegal business cause fools lack realness
And the Bay deserve better so cuddy came to kill it

[Outro]
Mac Mall! Uh huh, and DJ Fresh
Return of the motherfucking Mac, you know, Mac Mall Tonite Show
Thought you thought, uh huh!
I bet you bitch niggas wish I got indicted
Nah, nigga, Thizz is what it is
Shout out to Thizzlamic, Thizz Latin, Thizz Nation, 3rd World, Crestside, and all my motherfucking niggas
Buckle your motherfuckin' ass in and put on your helmet, nigga, cause we goin' to the land
Yadadimean?
