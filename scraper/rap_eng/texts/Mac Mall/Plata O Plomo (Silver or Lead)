[Verse 1: Mac Mall]
I say my prayers, to the Most High
Still I stay prepared with the AR-1-5
Never count my blessin’s, always keep my weapon
‘Cause out here they shoot first and never ask questions
Death can come from any direction
Pack protection for fuckboys that’s flexin’
Mane, the game don’t show no affection
No love, just tears and blood, stressin’, case-catchin’
But a life of poverty ain’t no fuckin’ way to live
And society ain’t worried about my muthafuckin’ kids
So it is what it is, want my presidents dead
When it comes to my felony, ain’t worried about the Feds
And one of them dummies killin’ over street cred
Cutthroat, crazy, mainey, like I ain’t took my meds
On the same block where my brethren bled
I shoot the fully quick, bust a muthafucka head

[Chorus]
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead

[Verse 2: Ray Luv]
I wake up early, learn the hustle while the rest sleepin’
I keep it movin’, on the go, I do my best dreamin’
I stay improvin’ on the flow like it’s a kept secret
Smile shinin’ like your face like a wet sequin
Your chick callin’ out my name, SOS beacon
But she livin’ in the past, I’m the next weekend
We was livin’ in the trash with the mask schemin’
Now I’m livin’ like Flash, everywhere, you see him
‘Cause we livin’ life fast with a per diem
And we bigger than the task, we in coliseums
‘Cause it’s bigger than the cash and a mausoleum
My niggas livin’ past the grave, boy, I could see ‘em
And we ‘bout to turn the page, boy, we could see it
And we gon’ set the world ablaze like Cease could see it
Lionheart, sharp teeth, we was barely eatin’
Now we winnin’ so much niggas swear we cheatin’

[Chorus]
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead

[Verse 3: Black C]
Ay, niggas ‘bout nothin’ but money, bitches and bullshit
We walk the block with a Glock and a full clip
Off the weed, sippin’ heem, niggas plot and scheme
Tryna leave with some money and leave a murder scene
Did anything, from pimpin’ bitches to movin’ cream
It’s for the team, that’s how we feel to keep our conscience clean
My niggas dream like Martin King for the lavish things
Under pressure, niggas meltdown like Charlie Sheen
The opposition not playin’ fair, the niggas snitchin’
Dirty D.A.’s gettin’ at ‘em with these propositions
You not competition, homie, I know heart of bitches
Who would stand behind a nigga, never get it twisted
All you speak is fiction, yeah, nigga, that’s real talk
You on YouTube tellin’ us how you got caught
Ask the Lord to forgive us ‘cause we know no better
All this evil that we did, we pray for room in Heaven

[Chorus]
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Bangin’ for the bread, silver or the lead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
Got to get to Heaven ‘fore the devil know I’m dead
