[Verse 2: Hurricane Chris]
You gotta keep your mouth closed (You gotta keep your mouth closed) ever since a youngin, I was taught never trust the Po
See, I remember back when I was trappin' in the grove
I told my plug I swear to God that I would never fold
I had like eight thousand when I went and grabbed six
I had to do some time, behind a motherfucking snitch
There's only one goal when I get out to get rich
I'm tired of the struggle, man, I'm tired of selling bricks
And now I'm doing shows and all this money that I'm making
I'm blowing on this loud, like a nigga a Jamaican
And now that I made it, tell my mama, no more stressing (No stressing')
I wake up every day and thank the lord for all my blessings
