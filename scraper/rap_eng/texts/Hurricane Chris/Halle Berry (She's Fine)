Ba-ba-ba-buuummm-bum-bum-bum-bum

Ba-ba-ba-buuummm-bum-bum-bum-bum {*4X*}

[Hook: Superstarr] + (Hurricane Chris)
She fine than a bitch, ass and her tits
Thick in the hips, every nigga want to call her
(Halle Berry, Halle Berry) Halle Berry
(Halle Berry, Halle Berry) Halle Berry
She walk it like a model, hands on her knees
Scrub the ground, she ain't nothing but a tease
(Halle Berry, Halle Berry) Halle Berry
(Halle Berry, Halle Berry) Halle Berry

[Hurricane Chris]
Well let's get ratchet, let's get ratchet
Look at her prettier then Halle and thicker than Janet
She say she like all of my club bangers I be jammin'
Told her to bust it open let me see what's really happenin'
She the ship and I'm the captain, I'm the captain
Booty bigger than the pussy and coochie dat make me happy
And I'm all the way in your city, I'm from Louisiana
So you gotta show me how your city do it for the camera
Make it drop and bring it back to the top, I'm no amateur
Girl you can give it to me it ain't nothing I can't handle
She just got out of the shower smellin' like a scented candle
And I'm finna flip her backwards, have her sliding off the mattress
No movie, no actin', baby this real action
Beat it up so bad, you be scared to walk past me
I know your Halle Berry, baby there's no actin'
I beat it up so bad, you be scared to walk past me
Fo' real

[Hook]

[Hurricane Chris]
Halle Berry you jazzy, that's way past fine
Girl you look like something that 'posed be on the dance line
Incredible by the waist, plus she got a pretty face
Even tho she got class she listen to UGK
I'm finna flip her through traffic with the top back of the donk
Girl I guarantee I can make you go numb numb numb numb numb
I got enough bread to take me and you to London
And back to America and all over the country
She make me want to keep her close by like a side kick
She the type of chick that ain't gone never look sloppy
I'm a beat it out the frame - Hurricane that's who I be
You must be Halle Berry, I don't need to see your I.D

[Hook]

[Superstarr]
Gon' bob your head, gon' work your shoulder
Now what I just said girl do it on the dick
Age ain't shit, I done got a lil' older
Me or yo man baby girl take a pic (which one)
She so classy, She's so jazzy (yea)
Lil mama blow like a ref {*whistle*}
Do it on the dick, she don't need no help
She say she got it, she do it all by herself
Do it do it sick wit' it (get so fine)
Like a god damn ticket, gave her a hickey
In order for a nig like me to spend cash
You gotta bounce like shocks in your ass
You, bed, ass, work
Start, slow, fas-ter
Mr. Halle Berry, Mr. Take-Your-Bitch
Take her from the club to the car to the dick
Superstarr
