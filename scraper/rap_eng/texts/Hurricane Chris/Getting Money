[Intro: Hurricane Chris]
It's been a long time comin
They wonder why I act like this, you heard me
It's all I know

[Nicole Wray]
They see us, still got much to learn
But otherwise still got money to burn
I'm in the streets can't take it out of me
I get money, get money, that's all I know

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
They see us, still I got much to learn
But otherwise still I got money to burn
I'm in the streets can't take it out of me
Get money, get money, that's all I know

[Hurricane Chris]
How could you criticize me for actin like I act if I ain't never had a thing
My daddy got locked up when I was 12, my whole life changed
My momma hustled hard and did (?) to get the bills paid
While you was probably ridin around the city in your Escalade
But now that I got money, I went and bought me two mansions
Just to stunt on them niggas who told me I never had it
I walked out the door the other day and my momma told me
You got a lot of nerve, she told me just because we got all this money to burn
Don't think you can't be in terms
A cold victim to the street so I stay packin some heat
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, 'cause they creep
Twenty-four hours, seven days of the week, I'm a beast

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I'm 18 years old and I done seen more drama than that lil'bit
Go on and (?) to talk about it unless you hear this
My pedal to the medal while I'm thinkin about all of my dogs
I lost in the street tryna ball like me
And this is for my niggas who used to roll gold D
Poppin the trunk on them swingers, hoppin out in tall tees
So all my niggas that's ballin and feel like me
From the struggle, you gutter to makin a lot of G
Keep my head up, remember who got me right where I'm at today
Long as I got money I give a damn what a hater say
One thing I know for sure I'ma get paper 'til it ain't no more
Plus I got a crazy flow...huh
I know somebody say "A hard head make a soft ass"
That's why I keep the Glock on the seat when I'm ridin in my jag
51/50, you don't know nothin about me
Homeboy I'm a (?), still ain't learn

[Chorus]- repeat 2x

[Hurricane Chris]
I'm makin money, nigga you can't tell me shit
I'm gon' keep on stuntin, steady shinin on the haters

[Nicole Wray]
I'm countin money, doin my thang, I be hustlin
From Monday to Sunday, doin what I want, I be gettin it in

[Chorus]- repeat 2x
