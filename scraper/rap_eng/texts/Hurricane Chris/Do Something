Ay Ay Ay
Say This Real Right Here Ya Heard Me
Nigga Just Don't Never Stop Hating

(Chorus 2x)
Ay I Think Somebody Trynna To Do Me Something
Cuz I Can't Sleep
And I'm Nervous When I Eat
And I Ain't Even Got No Beef

But It Feel Like I Got Beef
Cuz I Ain't Sleep In A Week
And I Ain't takin a Step Outta Of My Door With Out That Heat
I Think Somebody Trynna Do Me Somethin

I Think Somebody Tryinna To Do Me Something
Cuz I Can't Sleep
My Mama Cooked A Meal For Me But I Can't Eat
It's Too Much Shit On My Mind I Can't Stop Thinking About Dying
So Whoever Cross That Line You Gon Get That 45
My Daddy Just Got Home
But They Just Came And Got My Nigga

Got Caught Up With Two Choppas And A Pistol
And I'm Begining To Hate These Rap Niggas Real Fast
Putting My Name Up On A Track
I'mma Come Where You At And Blast
Just The Other Day I Almost Had To Do A Nigga
He thought I Was Gon Fight Him
But I Was Gon shoot a Nigga
Now I Know That Sound F**ked Up But I Ain't Got No Time
Soon As You Whoop A Nigga He Just Gone Go Get His Iron
His Nine Or His Ruga
However He Wanna Do Ya
I Ain't Faking
I Ain't Talking
I Ain't Boxing
I'mma Shoot Ya
His Nine Or His Ruga
However He Wanna Do Ya
I Ain't Faking
I Ain't Talking
I Ain't Boxing
I'mma Shoot Ya

(Chorus 2x)
I Think Somebody Tyrnna Do Me Something
I See Him Looking
Come Play Me Like A Rookie Watch how Quick I Leave You Shooken
I Hop Out Of The Bushes With That Thang Like Suprise (suprise)
And If You Try To Run That Choppa (lalala) Knock Off Yo Thighs (lalalalalala)
Take Of At You Shoot Out Yo Tires
Me And My Clique Be Posted Up A
Go Back To Subject Like How These Haters Wish Me Death
I Peep The Way These Niggas Trynna Play Me To The Left
So I Keep The Yay Off In The Trunk I Heated When I Step
Cuz Beefin Ain't Beefin Till You Stop Somebody Breath
And If We Creeping I'm Creeping Busting Till It Ain't Nothing Left
And If We Creeping I'm Creeping Busting Till It Ain't Nothing Left
Like That

Do Somethin (what)
Do Somethin, Do Somethin (what)
Nigga Do Somethin

Do Somethin (what)
Do Somethin, Do Somethin (what)
Nigga Do Somethin

Do Somethin (what)
Do Somethin, Do Somethin (what)
Nigga Do Somethin

Do Somethin (what)
Do Somethin, Do Somethin (what)
Nigga Do Somethin

(Chorus 2x)
I Remember One Sunday We Hit The SceneIt Was Packed
Sittng On 22's With The Paint Wet Black
Me And My Nigga He Got My Back I Got His Back ( i got his back)
Them Hoes Standing On Top Of Their Cars Shaking Cat
We Finna Do A Show So We Pull The Truck To The Back
When I Hit The Door Them Niggas Ain't Know How To Act
Them Hoes Grabbing On My Chain Pullin On My Plastic ( hurricane )
Want Me to Take Em' Home And Hit Em' From The Back
But When We Got Out Side Them Pussy Niggas Was Hatin
Actin Like He Wanna Do Me Somethin But He Fakin
I Asked Him What It Was With No F**king Hesataion
One False Move I'ma Leave You Shaking On The Pavement

I Had A Funny Feeling That Something Was Going On
Nigga Wanna Do Me Something Cuz I'm Riding On Chrome

I Had A Funny Feeling That Something Was Going On
Nigga Wanna Do Me Something Cuz I'm Riding On Chrome

(Chorus 2x)
Do Smethin
Nigga Somethin (faded out)
