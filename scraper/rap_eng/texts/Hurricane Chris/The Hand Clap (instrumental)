One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if you've got a bankroll
One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if your money dont fold

(Verse 1)
Let me get that hand clap
Let me get that hand clap, clap
They pull me out the club cuz I ain't know how to act
But I ain't really trippin'
We finna sneak through the back
And I got some like a grenade for them haters who wanna jack
(Whooo-Whooo)
And we going in my clique
Yeah I'm shining like a light
I get them diamonds on my wrist
Let me get a hand clap, hand clap
Lil momma breath stank so I told her bad back
And find me some water so I can roll harder
Slam on tha hater, like my name Vince Carter
They looking at me crazy cuz I bounce around the club
But I keep clapping my hands like I'm tryin' to kill a bug
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Ain't nobody in the club feeln like me
Plus I gotta clique Gorillas in black tees
Make the whole club clap like it sum kind of disease,please

(Chorus)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)

(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)

One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if you've got a bankroll
One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if your money on the floor

(Verse 2)
Well I hope you ain't tired of clapping your hands
Cuz we just got in the club
I spent 75 dollars on this shirt just for the club
Hell naw! I ain't leaving!
Let's take the VIP with them chicks and get freaky
Lil momma don't believe me
I showed her, I showed her
I beat it out the frame
I told her I'm a beast
And lil momma I'm Hurricane
And now 50 51 status shining on haters
Jumping, stomping, hanging, clapping, knocking over the tables
In a club, we get ratted until we fight
Yeah I'm stunting in his face cuz I got a big bank
Like big bank, hank
Cuz my money don't fold
Open up and blind them with a mouth full of gold
Let me get a hand clap
If you got that Hollaback
And I'm out my mind
I think I need to be slapped
Let me get a hand clap
If you got that Hollaback
And I'm out my mind
I think I need to be slapped
Like that?

(Chorus)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Now Rick James wit it
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)
Give me that hand clap
(Let me get that hand clap)

One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if you've got a bankroll
One for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if your money on the floor

(Verse 3)
Now drop that beat
Turn it up
That's too loud, mayne
Turn it down
Nah turn it back up
Put your hands up and make em' clap
Cuz now we on
If you wake, we make your hand clap
Just stay at home
You got a pocket full of money (huuh)
Oohh that's wazzup
Let me catch you by the bathroom
You gone get snuck
I rock that E-A-S-E-C-G
I'm Hurricane
And I'm S-O-U-T-H-S-I-D-E
It's what I claim
And let me see you put your arm up
And Rick James
I keep clapping my hand like I'm finna going insane
Lil momma wanna marry me
Just give me sum brain
I'm gripping, gripping the grain
Let me see you Rick James
One for the, one for the money
Two for the show
All ya'll haters better slow your roll
Or you ain't gotta chill
I can make you chill at the backslap
So security won't trip
They'll think I'm doing the hand clap

(Chorus)
Give me that hand clap
