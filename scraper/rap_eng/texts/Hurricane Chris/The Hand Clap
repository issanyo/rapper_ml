Gimme that hand clap (lemme get that hand clap) (x4)
Now Rick James with it
Gimme that hand clap (lemme get that hand clap) (x3)

[Bridge]
1 for the money, 2 for the show
Clap your hands if you got a bankroll
1 for the money, 2 for the show
Clap your hands if your money don't fall

[Hurricane Chris]
Lemme get that hand clap, lemme get that hand clap
Hey they pulled me out the club cause I ain't know how to act
But I ain't really trippin, we fin' to sneak through the back
And I got somethin like a grenade for them haters who wanna jack
(SCREWW!) Here we go me and my click
Yeah I'm shinin like a light I got them diamonds on my wrist
Lemme get a hand clap, hand clap
Lil' mama breath stank so I told her bad back
And hand me some water, so I can roll harder
Slam on a hater like my name Vince Carter
They lookin at me crazy cause I bounce around the club
And I be clappin my hands like I'm tryna kill a bug
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream
Ain't nobody in the club feelin like me
Plus I got a click of gorillas in black tees
Make the whole club clap like its some kinda disease, please

Well I hope you ain't tired of clappin your hands cause we just got in the club
I spent 75 dollars on this shirt just for the club
Hey I know we ain't leavin, lets hit the V.I.P
With them chickens and get freaky, lil' mama don't believe me
I showed her, I showed her, I beat it out the frame
I told her I'm a beast and lil' mama I'm Hurricane
And now 51/50 status, shinin on haters
Jumpin, stompin, hand clappin, knockin over the tables
In the club we get ratchet 'til we fight
Yeah I'm stuntin in his face cause I got a big bank
Like Big Bank Hank
Hey, cause my money don't fold
Open up and blind 'em with a mouth full of golds
Lemme get a hand clap, if you got that holla back
And I'm outta my mind I think I need to be slapped
Lemme get a hand clap, if you got that holla back
And I'm out my mind I thin I need to be slapped like that

Now drop that beat, turn it up
That's too loud man, turn it down, now turn it back up
Put your hands up and make them clap, cause now we on
And if you ain't gon' make your hands clap, then stay at home
You got a pocket full of money, huh, well that's what's up
Lemme catch you by the bathroom, you gon' get snuck
Around the E-A-S-E-T-C-G , I'm Hurricane
S-O-U-T-H-S-I-D-E, that's what I claim
Lemme see you put your arm up and your Rick James
I get to clappin my hands like I'm fin' to go insane
Lil' mama wanna marry me, just gimme some brain
Grippin grippin the grain, lemme see you Rick James
1 for the 1 for the money, 2 for the show
All y'all haters better slow your roll
But you ain't gotta chill, I can make you chill with a backslap
Security won't trip, they would think I'm doin the hand clap
