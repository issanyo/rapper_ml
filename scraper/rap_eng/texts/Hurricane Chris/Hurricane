[Chorus]
Been through it all
I'm talkin' storm, and rain
So many people put dirt on my name
I got mo' problems as I got mo' fame
A lot of cowards use my name in vain
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
This a deadly fuckin' Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane

[BOOSIE - VERSE 1]
Peter Piper, Peter Piper pepper
They call me names
Ya'll some fuckin' devils
I seek revenge, stackin' plenty cheddar
These cowards try to bring me down to get on my level
Now check tha weather
It's a bad ass hurricane
They worried mane
These winds, they come and flourish mane
Bow!
Do ya dirty mane
Come and tear tha whole city up
Andrew, Katrina
Might call for ya people
But they ain't come save ya like FEMA
You let ya words overload ya ass
You made a nigga mad
You thought prison would kill me
Just made another bag
Cold cash on yo hoe ass
Jewelhouse, my own swag
Top spot, I want that
16, I own that nigga

[Chorus]
Been it through it all
I'm talkin' storm, and rain
So many people put dirt on my name
I got mo' problems as I got mo' fame
A lot of cowards use my name in vain
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
This a deadly fuckin' Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane

[HURRICANE CHRIS - VERSE 2]
Ready, set, go
AK in tha car
I roll up, and smoke a nigga
No cigar
Carbon 15 tucked down in my jeans
Tha first nigga sneeze
I'm makin' him bleed
Tha King of BR
Tha Ratchet Ambassador
Tha choppa go blaka
Now you need a catheter
First shoot tha driver
Then kill all tha passengers
I took a loss
Bought some bricks, then I wrap 'em up
No carbon dueces
When killers come after ya
Disrespectful lil' bitch
Next time he call sayin' Hurricane name
Mane tell that nigga suck a dick
Sick of givin' pussies tha benefit of tha doubt
Need to go back to battin' 'em in tha mouth
Back to back in them Porches
No backin' down
Graduated killers
Fuck the cap and gown
Don't be scared cuz a nigga back in town
You was runnin' round like you ran shit
Wit' a loud mouth
And a lack of respect
Nigga you gon' get yo ass kicked
Be a man
Tell me to my face
And give ya voice a lil' bass
Cuz I could really bring pressure
I just hope you can carry the weight
Let's go!

[Chorus]
Been it through it all
I'm talkin' storm, and rain
So many people put dirt on my name
I got mo' problems as I got mo' fame
A lot of cowards use my name in vain
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
This a deadly fuckin' Hurricane
I hope they ready for this Hurricane
