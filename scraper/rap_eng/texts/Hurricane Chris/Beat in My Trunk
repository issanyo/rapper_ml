Beat In My Trunk

(Chorus)
15's in the trunk, 4-12's in the trunk, 4-10's in the trunk, 6x9's in the dash
License plates rattlin, bumper keep draggin, trunk straight blastin
Yea i got that, i got that , i got that, i got that
I got that, i got that , i got that, i got that
And it sound like
I got that, i got that , i got that, i got that
I got that, i got that
And it sound like
I got that beat up in my trunk i got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
I got that beat up in my trunk i got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
I got that beat up in my trunk i got that beat up in my trunk
I got that beat up in my trunk yea yea
License plates rattlin, bumper keep draggin, trunk straight blastin
Yea

Boom boom blam blam thats what you hear when im comin
4 15's in the trunk got the license plates hummin
And you should hear the regal with them tweeters when im comin
Take a look at the speakers thats exactly how im stuntin
Ostrich on my seats and ferocious beat in the trunk
Knockin pictures off the wall and I got sixes on my duck
I dont think these boys ready they dont think i really be wet
And my chevy shine stupid like i sprayed it with baggetts
You gotta get on my level lil daddy step up your game
I got speakers all in the grill of my car like im insane
Feel like i got music surgically implanted in my brain

I just chunk the deuce and hit the drank cause i can't hear a thang
The other day i got a ticket listenin to that hurricane
Soon as the police got out my sight i turned back up the bang
So much vibration in my trunk that my car won't stay in one lane
White people be lookin at my car like honey thats insane

(Chorus)
I got some speakers in my trunk that i know you ain't never seen
The fiber glass box and amps i got 3
Lil mama say she like big cars that hit hard
I pulled up at her house it was her and about six broads
I hopped outta the truck with me and my six boys
Me and my sick clique them boys they hit hard
Speakin of hittin hard the trunk makin some noise
Neighbors callin the laws cause i done knocked they windows off
When i pull up on the block im shakin the whole ground
If the baby touch my car the baby will fall down
But the trunk hit harder than Tyson in the first round
I got that amazin base and i won't turn it down
Before you pull up on me boy you better get your head right
Let me show you what i do to haters who won't play it right
Pull up on them boys who be stuntin at the red light
Open up my trunk on em and see who got they bread right

(Chorusx2)
