[Verse 1: Don Tee]

Straight up plain and simple
I need a bad bitch with cash bitch
Fuck a broke roaching ho
A nigga won't settle for no trash bitch
Better get up on yow game
Expecting me to do the same
You can't do nothing for a nigga
Besides give him good brain
Now shawty riding with me
She know how to do it
She can take a whole thang
And run straight thru it
From a half to a whole
From the streets to the pole
Being broke is not a option
When that pussy like gold
Yeah shawty so fine
I wanna hit it nine times
Cock yah leg up on that pillow
While I get up in yah spine
Now say its all mine
Even deeper I'm a dig
Like I'm trying to touch yah heart
Like I'm trying to make a kid
Baby girl hold on
I'm in that real freak zone
If you ain't really bout that life
Then why you edging shit on
Don Tee and Hurricane
Wally Dre up in this thing
That's certified street fame
In every club they gone sing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hurricane Chris]

My name Hurricane Chris
And I started this ratchet shit
Walking thru the club
Looking for the baddest bitch
Clean as a whistle
Got the kicks that match the fit
And all these hoes be on my dick
Cuz I got fifty on my wrist
You don't stunt like me
I'm in a league of my own
That's probably why yow baby mama
Wanna give me some dome
And when I pull up on chrome
I'm stopping the whole show
She say she love to fuck with niggas
That be strictly bout they dough
And when I give her that dick
She holla "give me some mo'"
I told her "baby money calling me so I gotta go"
I'm in that drop top Impala with the 454
Don't tell yah friends we be fucking
Keep that shit on the low
Man I be mobbing with my niggas
Cruising thru the city
She steady sending me pictures
Of them sexy ass titties
Told her keep that pussy wet
When I get back it's going down
And if I'm full of that Patron
She know I'm a act a clown

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wally Dre]

Now when it comes to bad bitches
My nigga I got plenty
Got desperate house wives
From Atlanta fucking with me
Got bitches from Decatur
Pulling capers for the paper
Got a chic out in Jamaica
Show you how to cook a cake up
Got a bitch out of New York
She'll buck fifty yah face up
Got Hollywood model bitches
Do anything for a lace-front
My interstate shawty
I call her my roadrunner
Do anything that I tell her
Just to make a couple hundreds
But I don't pay hoes
These bitches just dick hungry
Met a fine cougar bitch
Say her man leave her lonely
I beat that pussy up
Like ole girl stole something
Thinking I'm a pay for it
She got another thing coming
Got a girl form Tijuana
I met at the Bahamas
Met her through her mama
She know how to get them commas
My independent bitches
They don't need nothing from me
Know how to go out and get it
So they got they own money

[Hook]
