Talking to myself in the mirror with a knife, in my hand, I belong in the asylum
Tell the truth, I got a whole lotta problems and I don’t know what imma do about ‘em
Talking like he really bout that g shit
When it come to beef, bitch your murder I sponsor
Woke up, fucked the shit outta my bitch and then I told her: “Girl, you living with a monster”
Dark shades on, don’t want nobody to see me
Smoking on some shit that look like Kennedy and TeeFlii
We roll them Bob Marley’s and get high in the Ferrari
Pistol on my side, I cannot fuck up the party
While I’m parallel parking the foreign car with the automatic park
Oops, I forgot I can hop out this bitch park itself
Them VVS’s on my necklace looking hard to tell
That’s right
I’m on my shit and on my hip is where that heater be
I’m used to touching wife with my hands
Homie, alicia keys
Johnny got a gun
Mothafucka this a robbery
Tell them niggas “Make a false move, they’ll be cottage cheese”
Fucked the bitch so good she kicked me out and said “You gotta leave”
Took a trip to hell and told ‘em “Devil suck these N-U-Ts”
If I’m at the trap I ain’t coming to shoot a DVD
Like a zookeeper I handle pelicans check my pedigree
Address all of my beef like a man, I don’t need no Referee
Slightly thrown off in the head, don’t wanna mess with me
Type of nigga get mass, slap the shit out ya quick fast then pull my burner out and just blast, at ya bitchass
You dealing with a nigga who don’t fumble
AK-47 call that mothafucka Rhonda
Smoking on some shit that taste like it come from Uganda
What the fuck is gas, I blow thunder
