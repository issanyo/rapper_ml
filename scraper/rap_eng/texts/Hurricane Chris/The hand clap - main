Lil' momma breath stank, so, I told her bad back
And payin' me some water, so, I can roll harder
Slam on the hater like my name Vince Carter
They lookin' at me crazy 'coz I bounce around the club
And I keep clappin' my hands like I'm tryin' to kill a bug
Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream

Lil' momma don't believe me

I told her I'm a beast and lil' momma I'm Hurricane
And now, 50 want 50 status shinin' on haters
Jumpin', stompin', hangin', clappin', knockin' over the tables
In da club, we get ratted 'til we fight
Yeah, I'm stuntin' in his face 'coz I got a big bank
Like big bank, hang 'coz my money don't fold
Open up and blind them with a mouth full of gold
Let me get a hand clap if you got that hollaback
And now I'm out my mind, I think I need to be slapped
