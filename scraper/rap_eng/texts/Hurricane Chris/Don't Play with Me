[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Not tainted to the floor
Chopped to a drum roll
You can’t play me like a hoe nigga
You ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Not tainted to the floor
Chopped to a drum roll
You can’t play me like a hoe nigga
You ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Don t play with me

[Verse 1]
Talkin slick, I put your dick in the dirt
You think it's a game?
No copping loosies, you disrespect me I'm busting brains
Rappers like rapping about shit that they ain't never do
Say lil whoadie, that's the difference between me and you
If I pull out this tool believe me it ain't thinking of views
But I take that back, hop out with the mack
Rat tat tat, put your face on the news
Whoa, niggas can't see me with a rifle and a scope
Boss man ain't got to mention I sold coke
Damn cam, what are you doing?
Notice I said so
If I was still in the streets, I play it by the code
I made a promise to both of my hands, I'll never expose em
These niggas tell on themselves
If you ask me, that's hoe shit

[Chorus]
Ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Nuts hang to the floor
Chopped to a drum roll
You can’t play me like a hoe nigga
You ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Nuts hang to the floor
Chopped to a drum roll
You can’t play me like a hoe nigga
You ain’t gonna play me like no hoe nigga
Don t play with me

[Verse 2]
So you gon jack me nigga, you gon die trying
I hit ya all in your stomach with this lil hot 9
Take something now
Yeah that's just what I thought
Shoot first and ask later
Yeah that what I was taught
Fuck sending a hit, niggas be snitching so I'm knocking you out
End of the game, close range with a sawed off bitch
And this bitch at your dick and blow both of your balls off
Ain't help me out when I was down so fuck all yall
Callin my phone like he need to make some mane
His money looking funny and he ain't got shit to say
So I fronted him the issue just to put him on his feet
I grew up with this nigga I just want to see him eat
But little did I know, this nigga had a habit
He been dipping in the bag
Don't know how he got it pass me
It done been like a week and he ain't answering the phone
Homie ain't checking in, what the hell going on
Ok I been here before, put the sharks in the water
Have em swimming looking for you 4 O'clock in the morning
Niggas ain't even sleeping, all I'm thinking about is beefing
Murder on my mind
Rolling in the stolen and we go right back

[outro]
You ain't gon play me like no hoe nigga
