Now by the third verse, it's way hotter
We wide open, she dropped it down low
With her hips and her thighs rolling, I noticed
That can't nobody do it like I do it
I'm posted in V.I.P with two chick on the side of me

We got money so tell the other niggas to stop pulling
Out they cash and let me see how you act for a stack
Drop it low and brang it up like you a fool
Now put a dip in yo back and let me see what you can do

She say if she bend it over, it'll be a full moon
I told her bend it over, let me see that full moon
Like the boom, boom, room, whole club on tune
Shake it like you tryna break it
Ain't no sense in even faking

You know me I do it big by the bar and tell 'em jig
As soon as we walk in the do' we go
Straight to the dance flo

She busting it wide open and shaking it on the floor
I'm finna go to the bar and get some drank and hit the floor
I'm finna get on the flo, I'm finna get on the flo
I'm finna get on the flo, I'm finna get on the flo

She wanna drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
Drop & gimme 50, girl, drop & gimme 50

I'm finna get on the flo, I'm finna get on the flo

She wanna drop & gimme 50, drop & gimme 50
