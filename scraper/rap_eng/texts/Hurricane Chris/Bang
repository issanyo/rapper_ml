[Verse 1:]
Watch me jump right out of my J's
Soon I kick the can already the haters start to hate
All eyes on me cause I'm wearing that rubbaband chain
Ain't nobody up in here dancin but me how messed up is that mayne
They playin that "A Bay Bay" and nobody be clapping they
Hands mayne they hollin out make a circle for dollar boy
He bout to do the merry-go I told'em we don't superman nomore

Tryna hate I'll be wearing these rainbow's I got
Bapes, Yums and dem J's
