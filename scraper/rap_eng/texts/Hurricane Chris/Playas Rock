If I don't like the way she acting
Then I'm a tell her bye

You know how playas ride
Game recognize game
And I been running game alot
Never get caught in my lie
Cross my heart and hope to die

(Verse 1:)
Everythang was cool we was feeling each otha
Chillin in the jacuzzi just water no bubbles
You know me I keep it gutta
Hit it until you studda
Then she got there asking me questions
Like she was undercover
Like who was that lil chick that I let ride up in my ride
I'm a pimp so it ain't nothing for me to think of a lie
But I'd rather keep it real
And tell her just how I feel
Looky here if you see with with anotha chick
Then it's just what it is
You ain't my main dame
I just beat you out the frame
Baby I'm hurricane
You gotta stay in yo lane
Stick to the script of a pimp
And follow my gutta rules
And I u feel like u wanna leave
Then do what you do
Baby u think I'm goin cry
Just becuz I lost you
Everytime I loose one
I bounce back with 2
How you think I got you
Somebody got laid off
I'm a pimp I pimp a chicken
Until she get plaid out

(Verse 2:)
Say lil mama let me get up in it
Betta make you wanna give it to me
Like you never gave it up before
And I bet I make you moan
With my boys when I pull up in a rollz royce
I know where to hit ro
And I pull up fresh in the back
And the mode real low low
She can't see my eyes
Everybody holla cuzya boy so blind
And all I gotta do is get her in my ride
Give me a million dollars and I can make it go live
Let it be any chick in the world and I can make her mine
Put her in the whip
Now I'm feeling on her thighs
Take a shot of patron
And I'm feena go live
And then she told me that she want me to cut her
But she ain't want me to use no rubber (no rubber)
I'm feeling like u tryna get me caught up
No disrespect lil mama but that's just how I was brought up
If I can't use protection when I cut
Then it ain't no cut
I can't picture me going in you raw
That just ain't what's up
Lil mama I'm a pimp
And I will never get caught in my lie
Cross my heart and hope to die
Girl you know how playas rock
