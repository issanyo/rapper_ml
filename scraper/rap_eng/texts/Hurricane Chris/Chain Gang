Gotta keep that strap fa protection, no I don't need a case

Don't get it twisted we rappers thats where dat paper at
And we from the hood, we hustle to make that paper stack
I know I gotta work, my people gotta eat
I know I gotta work, my people gotta eat
Promised my momma I could make a million offa rippin beats
And what's understood is spoken for
If ya talkin money then coversation is open for
If y'ain't talkin money then conversation is usually short
My way spittin my life on this fuckin mic so im usually hoarse
So sick of losin my niggas for shit they gotta do
I mean them niggas get at you that mean you gotta shoot
And if ya light bill due then you gotta flip them
And if ya light bill due then you gotta flip them O's

So im on the road, runnin the game
Gotta make sure my cousins straight when he get out that chain gang
