[Intro: DJ Premier]

[MC Eiht]:
Yeah! Yeah! Ye-Yeah!!!!

[Scratch Hook] (Blaq Poet)
"When I come through the hood" - Akon 'I Still Kill'
(You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)
When I come through the hood (You know it's poppin)
Ain't nothin changed (You know it's on)

[Verse One: MC Eiht]
(When I come through the hood) Still reppin the hood
On foot patrol with a .38-snub
Hoes lovin the G, one-time's on post
Hopin a nigga snitch, hope he, sellin the most
Geah, will still follow the code
Couple of niggas stretched when the work got sold
Keepin it all hood, dress code never switch
Compton all day, these G's never snitched
Ghetto birds skip the area (through the hood) they still fly
Reportin the homicide when cars drive by
Ain't a damn thang changed, everybody got vexed
In the neighborhood spot, with a couple hood rats
Geah, niggas for life so it's all year round
Compton's still the same so you know how we get down
Geah! Yeah, Eiht get it cracking
Still a Menace so it be no acting

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Two: Young Maylay]
(When I come through the hood) ...I'm in the six-cuatro
Hoppin cause it's hot, the drop and squat the block low (Oh)
I'm not yo' ordinary thang, manye
In L.A., {EXTRAORDINARY GANG BANG}
Territorial marks, right on the wall
Broad day to nightfall, they ain't fightin wit' y'all (Naw!)
We poppin and chippin, poverty stricken
Honestly a lotta robberies are rockin a chick
Ain't nothin changed, we wear khakis and Chucks'
T-shirts, hat to the back, exactly wassup
See you probably like me if you ride with the heat
I survive and eat, identifyin with the streets
Don't think I'm a switch, get rich and then front
Cause when I'm finish with this, this where I end up
East to westside -- yes, that's on my momma
Maylay, L.A., popper from the Dodgers

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Blaq Poet]
(When I come through the hood) WHAT!!! You know it's love love
Chillin with the thugs and my duns light the dutch up
Nigga what the fuck's up? I'm all good
You don't wanna see me runnin up through your hood
Dressed in all black, from head to toe
Got your own goons sayin "Why you mess with Po'?"
I don't give a fuck, who they say is next to blow
They just ringtone rappers and they already know
What?
Ain't nothin changed, I spit flames forever
I'm hardcore like whips, chains and leather
I got shit locked, New York to this block
Time's up, tick tock, move slow, get popped
On the real yo I ain't even feelin niggas
Over twenty years in the game lyrically killing niggas
Reppin my hood checkin the weapons it's good
Steppigng all over niggas reps in they neck of the woods
