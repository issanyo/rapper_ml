[Verse 1: Young Maylay]
West coast Pro bowlin'
Roll with the tro' blowin'
Smokin' in the four door
Knowin' the po' scopin'
Throwin' up the logo
Cold in slow motion
Supposin', that's why I wore those clothes is on (what's the slow?)
Specific division, exquisite edition
Rap by hours on twin towers will catch us detention
Half of these rappers is cowards, they never been in the system
Wake yo' punk ass up, nigga you trippin'
In it like the senate, certified authentic
CA sports, bangin' in a minute
And L.A. the true blue the cherry flame fitted
Better know who's who cause every gang acquainted
I'm saluting all the troops hanging pac 10 penants, huh
Buckle your vest, cause here come the West
It's Young Maylay and the r-i-double-f-s
No stopping this, regardless servin' them marvelin'
It's like a fat ass drunk kicking hard guitar lifts
Shaking up the roof, tell them truth is off the meter
Woofers get to rumblin', bumpin' peakin' the tweeters, huh
Sounds pumpin', shakin' everything from the ground up
Cali earthquake gonna make the whole ground jump
It's worth takin', if you talkin' the right shit
Suburban stakes, big skates on a tight rip, huh
Rims and tires, higher and higher
Pass them bars, keep thinkin' the inside on fire
When I'm cheefin' the cheefer, blowin' the reefer, huh
In the Hemi, the Hemi, ya hear me?
Watch the 300c G, nigga Bentley
Think their doses is the coolest, sold the fan blade
5 inch lifting sittin' and in the band aids
Off it again, coughin' the flim
Crawl in the crosswalk, flossin' all of the rim
Small time grinding, but ballin' to win
Trying to survive but niggas all in the pen, gotta call up the ends
Prison system, segregated courts
High speed chasin' is a spectator sport
Known for low lows, best hoes and bong, yay
Only thing you hear about the west is Kanye
Come on mayne, this is for the west coast now
