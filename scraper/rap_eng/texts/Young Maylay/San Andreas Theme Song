Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous, gangbangers, and cold heat
In Los Santos neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing even police
Four deep in a green rag with gold feet
Blast with the flag on the strap that's OG
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff, nice and straight
You got stats: respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat, and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Prolaps
Sub Urban, Zip, Victim, and D Sachs
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good.(survivals good)
Ducking shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out busting gunning till they tuck they tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions(impossible missions)
Twisted predicaments hostile positions.(hostile positions)
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Because the 'dreas for the gangsters homeboy
Hands is the language for the 'bangers homeboy
And its dangerous homeboy
Get your brains blow for how you do your fingers homeboy
Heat cocked' we popping them hot one's
Dump them out bend the block, shaken before the cops come
Listen for sirens, they don't got none
Back another lap catch a straggler with a shotgun
Hittin them up what that Grove Street like
In a dirty sling shot and old Levi's
