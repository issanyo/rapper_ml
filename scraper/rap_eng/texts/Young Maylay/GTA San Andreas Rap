[Verse]
Welcome to San Andreas I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing even police
Four deep in a green rag with both feet
Blast with the flag on the strap that's OG
Stay in shape hit the gym lift the weights
Get super cut or big and buff nice and straight
You got stats respect, weapon skill
Stamina muscle fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Bincos and Prolaps
Suburban Zip Victim and D Sach
Watch your back when you in rival hoods
They'll test just to guess if your survivals good
Ducking shells at the Cluck'n Bell
Jump out busting gunning till they tuck they tail
It seem like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me
Cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Because the Dreas for the gangsters homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers homeboy
And its dangerous homeboy
Get your brains blew for how you do your fingers homeboy
Heat cocked we popping them hot one's dump them out
Bend the block shaken before the cops come
Listen for sirens but they don't got none
Back another lap catch a straggler with a shotgun
Hittin them up what that Grove Street like
In a dirty sling shot mo' knee high
