[Verse 1: Maylay]
I know you’re fed up with hearing styles old and decrepit
We’re doing what’s next in your hemoglobin
With more oxygen brewing than eucalyptus
We figured it’s our turn to carry the torch with voice maturity
Too many lessons missing in these books of history
Making the mass worry instead of be warriors
I don’t about yours, but my story’s real and simple
Sending smoke signals with Moses T. and V.I.T.A.L
Get this math right, every paragraph I write on
Raising like the sun, always giving thanks and praises
Amazing to chosen, bamboozling competition
Read the writing on the wall and said it’s time for manifesting

[Hook: Matt Embree]
People still fighting and everybody crying, we’re trying to get together so we all can start uniting
No need to tell the politicians writing on the wall
No need to tell ‘em that the writings on the wall

[Verse 2: V.I.T.A.L. Emcee]
My terrorist tactics are greatly climactic, displayed to the world within verbal semantics
That frantically panic the whole
Upsetting the set up of old traditional roles
And I propose we make a new law
Capitalistic society mauled
The fallacies that we've been running with fall
And no longer we’re having our back to the wall
‘Cause all they've been wanting to do is manipulate us into thinking whatever they stipulate
Once they eliminate trust and incriminate us for speaking our minds, they’re gon instigate wars
And calling the puppets for doing their bidding is only inevitable
Securing a foreign horizon to take up a claim on a resource that ain't even plentiful
And they’re calling us radical
‘Cause we don’t believe in a fiscal annual
Fact of the matter is that if we don’t ever wizen, then we will surprise ‘em, reverting ourselves into animals
To take it all back from the shattered tatter
So let humanity gather, where we’re overjoyed within the moment that we finally matter

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Matt Embree]
Can’t you read what the plastic people say
With billboards in their hands and semi-circles on their faces
The key to life is just to buy your fears away
9 to 5 enslavement for 50 dollars a day
So I pray to the faith, that we’ll believe in ourselves
Experience as the teacher, can’t learn nothing from a preacher who encourages the paranoia that has struck us all
Don’t look anyone in the eyes and lock your doors come night fall
Till we all been confined to our air conditioned tombs
Cubicle to cubicle we’re biting our nails down to the cuticle
‘Cause now our mindsets are contorted
Distorted, forced to buy into the lies they have purported
Like suddenly who you are is determined by your possessions
Everything you own will eventually own you
If you fall into that single file undead procession
We’re lifeless at 30, but dead at 75
Chasing the unattainable with a glazed look in our eyes

[Hook]

[Outro: V.I.T.A.L. Emcee]
Yeah, Maylay, Madmattics
And I'm V.I.T.A.L. Emcee
We talking about a revolution here people
But we ain't talking about the goods or the mullet toss
We're talking about a revolution of everyday life
A revolution of the mind, you know what I mean?
So once you seen the truth in front of you
And you know how to handle yourself better in everyday situations
Look, man, we ain't put on this earth to break our backs for somebody else's dream
Work for your own, get your own: it's just a fact of life
A fact of the matter, and a matter of the mind
Make it worth while, yeah, peace...
