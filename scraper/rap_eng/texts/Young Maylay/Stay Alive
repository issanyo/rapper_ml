[Intro] (Hook)
All this jealousy and envy
All this hustelin
They wanna tell on me
To my enemies AR-15
Im talking Penalties
If u run up on me
I'd rather Stay Alive (6x)
I'd rather Stay Alive (7x)

All this jealousy and envy
All this hustelin
They wanna tell on me
To my enemies AR-15
Im talking Penalties
If u run up on me
I'd rather Stay Alive (6x)
I'd rather Stay Alive (7x)

1. Verse
Imagine Maylay getting sprayed by another
Seven days to the grave face layed in the gutta
Deacon and a preacher prayin' with my mother
[?] take me away under the cover (damn..)
Family are moanin' and grievin' the homies is callin' a meetin'
Important this evenin'
Corcoran to sweden of course with the speed
Reliable source is get the report and tweetin
Underground record sells is going through the roof
This how it happen when u die I ain't lying thats the truth
Females crying cause they missin' a nigga
Little homies get the ride after sippin' on liquor
Be a sad day in LA when Maylay pass
I want everybody gang bang and wave their flags
Till that day im chasin' the grip stay out my way
Cause haters get chip when I got paper to flip
Sharin' life with my friends at professional fights
Splittin' the ends till the decimals right
I ain't try to hit the pin or even get locked up
They snitchin' when im trippin' then I end up in cop cuffs

2. Verse
I got my day to die
But id rather stay alive
And see my kids having kids looking in their eyes
Imma meet my maker jesus christ lord and saviour
But i hope i dont go down by no haters (the game fishy)
The devil's lurkin im up in the same trenches
Where is killing revenge for game vengeance its senseless but
I dont wanna be the victim or whitness or the defendant
For chippin' then repentin' for forgiveness
Acting like I didn't but its all in my conscious
I do it all again i promise just beein' honest (swear to god)
(on my momma) i ain't tryin' to be violent
Let me pause moment of silence ..... (for what)
For the people that didn't make it to the gates i can't take it
I need to bathe in holy water naked
I can't lie im a wrong doer not the kids a whole people in shittin
A nigga is a long shooter
Another calendar another four seasons
Hopefully i make it no grievins
If thats how its meant to be
Its to the tenth degree but i smurk like i did the work
When they sentence me
