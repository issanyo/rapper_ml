[Verse]
Welcome to San Andreas, I'm CJ from Grove Street
Land of the heinous, gang bangers and cold heat
In Los Santos neighbors get no sleep
Beefing with anybody competing even police
For deepin' a green rag with both feet
Blast wit' a flag on the strap, that's OG!
Stay in shape, hit the gym, lift the weights
Get super cut and big and buff nice and straight
You got stats, respect, weapon skill
Stamina, muscle, fat and sex appeal
You get clothes from Binco, and ProLaps, Suburban, Zip, Victim and D-Sachs
Watch yo' back when them rival hoods
They'll test just to guess at your survivor skill
Duckin' shells at the Cluckin' Bell
Jump out, bust a gun until they tuck they tail
It seems like I'm on impossible missions
Twisted predicaments, hostile positions
Tenpenny and Pulaski harass me, cop cars been on our ass the last past week
Cause the 'Dreas is full of gangsters homeboy
Hands is the language for the bangers homeboy
And it's dangerous homeboy
Get your brains 'fore how you do yo fingers homeboy
Heat cock we popping hop dump em out been a block shake before the cops come
Listen to sirens they ain't got none back another lap catch a straggler with a shot gun
Hit em up wit' a Grove Street lie dirty sling shot mo' knee high
