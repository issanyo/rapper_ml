[Intro]
Yeah, I am the baddest rapper known, You're got damn right
Ey, change the key
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
[let me slide up in here]
They dont like it [x4]
[That's better]
Begging in time for somebodys rhyming
They dont like when I decide to mic it
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
They,they,they dont like it when i decide to mic it
Nah
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
Maylay, Hallway Productions, Dj Crazy Toones

[Verse 1: Maylay]
They dont like when I decide to mic it
Cuz I come from the south where they only ride to the tight shit
Flowing peccable so cold I let it blow, wet vocals froze
And let it snow in the eskimos
I'm the voice of the streets the boys and beasts
Other MCs decrease the poise in the beats
Maylay the crowd favorite, wild kild now save it
And I stay on the dail, your style's outdated gangrelated hip hop
I came to rip spots and make these lames kick rocks up in their flip flops
Matter of fact, actually, I'm tired of the faggotry
And rappers that got lie bitches and shit mad at me
Hold up, wait, let me get this shit straight
I dont give a fuck about you or your mixtape
You ain't thight, dont know you, won't promote you, that's protocol
Especially when your skills're about as sharp as a bowlingball

[Hook]
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
They,they,they dont like it when i decide to mic it  [Big Swang records]
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming

[Bridge]
Hold my scratch WC, these marks think I'm playing

[Verse 2: Maylay]
Let me grip the mic rip it thight hit you with some instant flight
Break it down like the muscle bound around kryptonite
Had the speakers jumping up, subbing like (Obwowo...)
Louder than the Clouds when they growl in the thunder pump
Illest with a sick and ignant dont stop get it get it
Flip it, twist it 'till I end up with a ticket in it
One of the thightest that spit it in about a sec
Rappers ain't gotta like it they ain't buying no records
I'm back home, they whack and rap wrong
Dont let the track and the cover and tats get you slapped on
I got fans from the gangland to the goldcoast
You outta place young man coming at grown folks
It takes skills not a few dollars and car wheels
Close are these parkass-hoes to had a barkfeel
Hardest on the thang, regardless ain't the thang
You dont translate the best rap artist in the game

[Hook]
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
They dont like it when i decide to mic it
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming  [Y'all don' want to see me now more]
They dont like it when i decide to mic it  [They can't hold me, nah]
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming
They dont like it when i decide to mic it
You've been begging in time for somebodys rhyming  [Looking better than you, rapping better than you]

[Outro]
They dont like it when i decide to mic it.. ..mic it, mic it, mic it, mic it, mic it...
