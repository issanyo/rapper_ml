[Verse 1]
Open your eyes
Do you ever feel that life's so ruff
Do you realize
We're living in a system that's so unjust
They say all people are created
Supposed to be so equal
Then why is it I'm like ?
Some guilty is that equal
The world is ?
But thing just ain't the same

[Chorus]
Now what you gonna do
When you got no hope
When you gotta feed ya kids
And you gotta slang dope
Now what you gonna do when ya false accused
I need representation
Now I'm dressed in the county blues

[Verse 2]
I see marijuana ship?
Waiting to get out no doubt, no doubt
They say it's un-american
They say it's un-american
Its all america it its?
Tis tis tis tis
Are the ones that killed my great black leaders
Are the same ones
Are the same ones in office
Now tell me who's wrong
Now whats going on, what's going on in the revolution
Mad in sight of a?
Mixed in cypher
It's time for revolution

[Bridge]
Rolling with my homies and I'm packing, jacking
If you need that dope I got that double up sack
Double up, double up
Much love for you
Taste more better than a Almond Joy
And when I rock it up it always swell
Never using B-12, B-12
When I rock it up it always swell
Never using B-12, B-12


Now I'm like sick
I get sick of those racist TV shows
Those cops
Cause all my black people are stars
Cause all we ever get seen is on 6 o'clock
News that is, maybe were Connie Chung
Now what going on, what's going down, what's your game
When we want to know but thing just go away

[Chorus]
What you gonna do
When ya got no hope
When you gotta feed ya kids
And ya gotta slang dope
Now what you gonna do when ya falsed accused
I need representation
Now I'm dressed in the county blues


I see men all over this ship?
Waiting to get out no doubt
With no clout

Now let me tell you here

Open your eyes
Do you ever feel that life's so ruff
Do you realize
We're living in a system that so unjust
All people are created
Supposed to be so equal...
