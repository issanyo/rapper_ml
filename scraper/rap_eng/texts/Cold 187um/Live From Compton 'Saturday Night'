MC Ren: Ey, ey fuck what you going through dog
*Ren hangs up the phone*
Hutch: Ah, ah Ren, Ren what's up, ah, nigga hang up on a nigga and shit

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
Come on and step on in, no turnin back
While I drop shit that have your mind turnin black
Nigga I break God damn necks, when I drop verses
And blind your sight, from the shit that I recite
Live from Compton it's Saturday night
But ain't no joke, cause I don't play that shit
Niggas you know I ain't no motherfuckin comic
Droppin street knowledge, plus a nigga Islamic
Hoodrats they do the hoochie boogie for a fuck
But that shit don't be workin
When I'm rollin in my truck, the farthest they get is a big wheel
For real, and bitch-made-niggas get they caps peeled
When I walk, puts a hole in the floor, with the steel toe
As if you didn't know, now that you know nigga act like you knew
And if you continue trippin, motherfuck you
I'm walkin with my niggas
With the help of 187 on this tight ass track
So step the hell back, and you can't afford to sleep
Because my shit gets deep

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
Ok, time for me to rustle more shit, represent to the fullest
Everytime that I'm spit, get'cha lit
Get'cha lifted, get'cha high as you wanna go
Breakin fools off that wanna floss your gold
Cause I hate flossers and I hate braggers
I hate short stoppers and I hate laggers
On the real, niggas be wanna Free Kick It pass
So they can beat your shit, and jack your ass
I give em 187 times to try
But on the real, they better off committin suicide
Slide me the TEC Ren, so I can show 'em
That I'm not to be trusted, and not to be fucked with
And definately not that motherfucker
They wanna press they luck with
I keep it goin uncut, and if I get mad enough
I shoot they whole fuckin set up
And don't say I didn't warn ya
It ain't funny, when you be a victim by the corner
187 be the gate keeper
Cause where I'm from, the shit gets deeper

[Verse 3: MC Ren]
My shit gets backed up for days and days
It's hard to sleep, my shit is too deep
Well how in the hell am I gonna deal with new niggas
That be comin hollerin wolf, and ain't put out shit yet
Rollin down the street in my 4-5-0
Throwin wack niggas shit out my window
Cause rarely do I see niggas that be comin with that funky ass shit
That make you say fuck ay, go shoot a nigga down
But here comes that black nigga that they call Ren
Makin niggas go and act crazy again
Niggas be fuckin fools for the hell of it
Some down old niggas better not come this way
Cause I just don't give a fuck
Cause I get in a baby gangsta mode
Bitch slappin niggas with my fist
Cause I insist I'm a hell of a lyricist
But my roots in the street
Killin playa haters over some wicked ass beats
Me and my niggas come and get your ass
Then me and my niggas beat up on that ass
Cause me and my niggas, nigga, love the creep
When the shit gets deep, it gets deep
