[Opening Skit: Crooked Patrol Cops gaffling Young black males]
[YBM #1] Where the weed you fold up for tonight?
[Cop #1] You open your mouth one more time, I'm gonna close for you

[Hook: Cold 187um]
I don't know why one time always trippin' (x3)
I bet this time that I won't be slippin'

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
They tell you shut up!!
Nigga or you'll get that ass smoked
You're about 2 seconds away, from gettin' your back broke
Searchin' my car for some guns and some dope
But all they could find was some Philies and the Endo roach
Motherfuckers straight took my high down
And since they couldn't find, shit they really wanted to clown
Sayin: who car's this? - Who bought that?
Thinkin' I don't own shit, because I'm black
They go in shock when it's all in my name
And then, them punk motherfuckers attitudes change
Cause they always actin' like a motherfuckerin' bitch
Can't see a nigga rich, can't see a nigga havin' shit
You see, that's the way they tried to play
Tried to tear up your shit and say: I'm sorry, have a nice day
Now, back in the days, I wouldn't trip, but not now
So I'mma call up my lawyer, and blow their fuckin' house down

[Hook: Cold 187um & Kokane w/ minor variations]
Cause I don't know why one time always trippin'
I don't know why one time always trippin'
[KM.G:] I don't know why? I don't know why?
I don't know why one time always trippin?
[KM.G:] I don't know why? I don't know why?
I bet this time that I won't be slippin'

[Verse 2: KM.G]
You see, I once had a homie named Fred
He got sprung on a buddy cause she gave good head
She let him spent his money here and there
She didn't care, baby, parlay, parlay
Shake your little derri√®re
He schemed to fiend, to hang with the winnin' team
General relief, but had caviar dreams
He used to run with the clique that have the gauges and the nines
The Riders and the real hard time
But baby had him thinkin' in the wrong direction
Thought somehow, he needed no protection
He gave up the 4-1-1, and who was holding ground!
Who was comin' up! - and who was goin' down!
She asked the nigga if he was down with the snow
Well, you know, Above the Law is kind of down with the powder
They sent me to Texas then I went Colorado
Came back on the weekend to set up post
And I still got my sunday at the Barbary Coast
Girl, I still got my sunday at the Barbary Coast
Stupid nigga, sewed your ass to roast
Cause the bitch in the ride ain't nothin' but the law
Attached with the wire, Columbo for hire
So now the law was on their way
Stupid ass nigga had a bird in his tre
He probably get a dub to the L
So don't snitch on the clinic on the way to jail

[Outro: same as hook w/ variations]
