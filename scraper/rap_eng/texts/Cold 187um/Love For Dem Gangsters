[Violent J]
Aww shit, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't step
On a funky-ass track jump back
Strapped with a axe in the back and a 7-8 lak
Unclean, gangsta lean, I blow green
None the gangbang like it ain't no thing
I hang with OG killas don't set trip
Or you might get stabbed in the fucking head
Wake the death when I bump the street
I kick juggalo shit to a gangsta beat
It's so sweet, waving my hatchet flags
Leaving hell of filed enemies rocking toe tags
With Shaggz and Hutch and a folt, pros
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Act like ya know as we kick the corers
Givin love to them killas that I can be 4 us

[Chorus]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right)
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Chump chump on fools with the quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get props for the way that I kick this
I’m a ninja, a straight ninja (who's that?)
The southwest choke-doke
And I squeezed so hard that you felt it broke
Showed up at your funeral and smoked ya folk
A juggalo like me let a scrotum swing
Now I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I tell it like it straight-up is
If here’s somebody in my trunk you better mind your business
And my Mossberg bangs like thunder, bury you under
Imma hand grenade ur parade
OG's show the way, so I give love to 'em

[Chorus]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right)
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)

[Cold 187]
E-A-Z-Y, must I chase the cat and be a dog, a straight-up hog
I leapfrog to the sound of a gangsta beat
So you can hear my shit bump from Compton to the D
The O.G. H-U-T-C-H Hustla
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
And a… Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it comes to me
Cause I'm the long dick bust-a-nut like my nigga Eazy
Bitches can't see me, hoes think I'm crazy
But I don't think so, because I'm straight loco
I give a fuck about a skanless bitch
I let it hit it one time if you suck this dick
I won't trip, gives my dough to no ho
That's how it is when I gives love to ya, Wooo!!

[Chorus]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right )
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Dedicated to the godfather of gangsta rap, Straight up streets of Compton, The hip hop thugsta, Eazy Mothafucking E!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Chorus]
If you got love for them gangstas
Let me hear you one time if you down for the crime (that's right)
If you got love for them ninjas
Let me hear you say hooo if you’re straight juggalo (hooooo!) (Eazy Mothafucking E!!!!!!!!!!!!)
If you got love for them butterflies
Let me hear you say ooooh, lettes we want you (ooooooh!)
If you got love for the family
Let me hear you motherfuckers just scream (heeeeeeey!) (Eazy Mothafucking E!!!!!!!!!!!!)
