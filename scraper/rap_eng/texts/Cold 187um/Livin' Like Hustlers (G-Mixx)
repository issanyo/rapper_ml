[Intro/Hook: Dr. Dre Scratching]
AWWWWWWWoow woooooww
Ooohh Lord, living like the hustlers
Ooohh Lord, living like the hustlers

[Cold 187Um]
Let me start it off, cause I'm a player
Fade into part two, I'm the number one whore layer
A mack, a player and a pimp
Something much stronger than your average drink
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm like moonshine
Take a sip of my rhyme and I'll take over your mind
Cause I don't think like the average thinker
Call me the nightstalker of your neighborhood head shrinker
187 is like a megablast
I take too many names, I kick too much ass

[KM.G]
KM.G, the number one mack daddy
Eating chicken like a motherfucker, rolling in my Caddy
With my brim cold bent to the side, I bump and slide
Go-Mack in the back, 187 to the side
Street Pilgrims, pioneering the land
Above the Law status, with a gat in my hand
A mind designed like Frank Nitty
Living large on the Mic, doing damage for the city
The city of toners, which is known as L.A
Where the hustlers hustle and the ballers play
We got the dope beats from the homeboy Dre
And it had to be done (How?) the Ruthless way
187, what's up?
What do we do at our show?

[Cold 187Um]
We wear black on black with the Locs and the Romeos
Start stepping, unload my Mic weapon
We say it's fitting, you think it's hitting
K.M.G means knowledge most greatly
Some people like me, most people hate me
In other words, I kick my gift
Do you be sleeping, KM.G?
No, I don't drift
I lounge or lay, cause suckers take advantage
Yo, what do we do to them?
Yo, we're doing damage
Cause we not punks, fools, sissies, or busters
And the way that we live.. is like hustlers

[Hook]

[Cold 187Um]
I used to sell big lleyo on the block
That when all the hardheads, gain on hard knocks
I started with Gs and then I moved to keys
And at this point my life went with ease
In other words, my pockets was thick
I didn't worry about the Feds, I was checking the mitt
Pull a swoop to Farouk, got dressed to please
Got the crib pimped out so that the bitches flee
I bought a ride, "what Kind?" a white Corvette
So I can do a ghost move when it's time to jet

[KM.G]
When I was nineteen, I was on owned my home
Hooked up big connections on my mobile phone
At home, or maybe on my person
To clock big Gs, I'd be definitely certain
To live the lifestyle, the luxury, the freaks, the frills
Yo, you was living kind of large, man
On the real, deals was being made
Suckers was getting sprayed
In other words, we was getting paid
Like hustlers

[Hook]

[Cold 187Um]
Let me proceed, cause I got the green light
For the numero uno 87, it must be hype
For now, let me lay the cards on the table
So you can figure out who's worried or stable
I max and tax and relax and stack Gs
Stick that to the facts, that's why I crack them with ease
Please, get off the convoy, I think you're confused
When you cross, I told you you'd get tossed, and you lose
Now, A-B-O-V-E L-A-W, to some people
Yo, that spells trouble
But we're not a group promoting violence
But when it comes to speaking the real, I won't be silent
Speak all reality when I'm on the Mic
So you don't have to run and have a stereotype
See, see cause stereotypes will make you dumb
So kick back and listen, yo, to the knowledge that's grump

[KM.G]
See, the law has provided me, the KM.G
That's complex with the style but done easily
Pitch a bitch if I have to, you know why?
I'm undercover doing dirt, I'm a hell of a spy
Now numero 187 is a detonator, deadly than a hand grenade
Much harder than a fool to fade
Not a Forty, not a Quart or a Six-pack
Me, K.M.G, Total K-OSS, and Go-Mack
Cause I unload my weapon with force
Yeah, I'm never detected, I live respected
As a baller, a player or a pimp
Yo, pass me the forty, I commence to dent

[Cold 187Um]
A sissy soft sucker with no title
Unplug the machine, 187 is vital
Like a Beretta, with a mega clip
With a silencer on it, with the hollow point tip
But that is our business, on that we won't dwell
We make records for you to learn: Listen and Tell
Tell your mammas, tell a friend, tell a fool or a jerk
Tell them KM.G people it's time to put in some work
Like Hustlers

[Hook]
