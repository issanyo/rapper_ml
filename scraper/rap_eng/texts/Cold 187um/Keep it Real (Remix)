[Intro]
(Nigga, gotta keep my shit real)
Remix, ugh, yeah
Putting down like this, like this

[Verse 1]
You know I gotta keep it on, like light but I'm heavy
Nigga, tell your hoe to stay away from the Chevy
I make you niggas pray everyday like Bone
When you see me touch a motherfucking microphone
Straight out off the motherfucking streets of Compton like E
Made my first G before adding on the MC
White people hate me like Johnnie Cochran
Yelling fuck the police since niggas been pop locking
I'm So So Def like Jermaine
You bitches wanna see me fuck it up, but can't take the pain
You niggas bragging like Big Poppa
While you're living in a fucking hut like Jabba
Ugh, like Rick, I'm knocking niggas out the box
I'll make your ass wanna have the big one like Redd Foxx
So fuck what you're going through
You whack niggas this shit's for you
Keeps it real

[Hook]
Now, who keeps it real?
(You keeps it real)
Ren in the cut, for real niggas what
Niggas out faking like they got skills
Rolling around with their rats in their floss mobiles
And that's real

[Bridge]
Knock them out the box Ren, knock the out Ren

[Verse 2]
Living room packed, laid back on the flow
Fools can't see me on the live with a Lando
I'm running fools straight to the dirt
While my man Train talking on the phone the evil curt
Niggas waste gas driving down the same streets
And hood rats wishing for the passenger seats
Flag them down, like they're flagging down to get a taxi
Too good to ride a bus, tricking is a must
Another day kicking back, the Scientist is hard at work
Thinking how to get paid, kicking back in the shade
Or call Will and Temple where my homie down by Zeenie
With the bald head, it's too hot for the beanie
Sitting on the porch, niggas run the stop sign
Hookers sell their bodies around the way ain't hard to find
Right in the corner of McDonald's Parking Lot
Peeping out their hair cause that spot is hot

[Hook]
Now, who keeps it real?
(You keeps it real)
Ren in the cut, for real niggas what
Niggas out faking like they got skills
Rolling around with their rats in their floss mobiles
And that's real

[Bridge]
Knock them out the box Ren, knock the out Ren

[Break]
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real (x5)
Keep my shit real

[Verse 3]
Randy up the street cutting up the fresh fade
And Compton P.D. around the corner about to raid
The yellow Helicopter hanging around like a Gnat
And hood rats yelling out a car where the party at
While Robbin and Train go and get a deuce
And niggas around the way don't give a fuck about a gang truce
But I gotta lot of love for my people
And like they ain't crying, niggas just keep dying
I won't be like most niggas and just come to shoot my video in Compton
Then disappear for a year
We're making fools like that, shake the spot
One for the treble, jack your ass in the Parking Lot
Cause handkerchief headed niggas come around faking
Bragging about that money they be making
Boot licking, butt dancing, and niggas just better chill
Before I tell them how I feel, and that's real

[Hook]
Now, who keeps it real?
(You keeps it real)
Ren in the cut, for real niggas what
Niggas out faking like they got skills
Rolling around with their rats in their floss mobiles
And that's real

[Bridge]
Knock them out the box Ren, knock the out Ren

[Break]
Nigga, gotta keep my shit real (x5)
Keep my shit real
