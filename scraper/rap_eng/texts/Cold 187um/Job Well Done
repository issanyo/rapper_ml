[Verse 1]
See I'm a killer, I don't work wit feelings
When it comes to hit my mark I move complete precision
Here's the mission, I'm way out in the sticks
Contemplating y'all, How I'ma hit Father Ducket
Yeah I'ma get Father Ducket
Uh, Cause when I tell em I can get the job done they can trust it
See I'ma lay low when I first hit the town
Check in the cheap mo-mo and peep out the surroundings
Hit the local bar there's only one in the city
Befriend this little waitress named Britney and put her down wit me
I knocked her down after a couple of ticks
And pillow talk'll be pertinent if you fucking the right bitch
Uh, She gave me the scoop on how Ducket is shady
How he playing foul using God robbing the congregation
A real motherfucking scumbag
And ain't nobody gon miss him when I cap his ass
Uh

[Chorus]
You can run all you want to but you can't hide
I said I'm in for murder and I ain't lie
Nobody looking at it like a saint die
We carry on, We carry on

[Verse 2]
See I probably wouldn't have no problems wit Father Ducket
But he's so slimy and the money's so good it's like fuck it
Got his clause in the collection plate
More than a few choir boys wit allegations of rape
Putting everything in the name of the holy
Somebody need to send him to hell cause he a phony
This motherfucker giving me a vendetta
He gon understand when I hit him wit the beretta
And since he got the church on lock
I gotta lay low and tip-toe and come up wit the intricate plot
So I chilled for a second and blended in
Said I wanted to turn my life around and join the congregation
After a while, I was deep in
Became a member and ordained a Deacon
Do what it takes to hit my mark
Cause I'm a born killer for reala true to the heart

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now this is how a killer move slick and swift
I'm a head Deacon sitting right up in the pulpit
I'm chilling, Trying to get positioned
Waiting for the opportune moment so I can get him
Cause when ya close, You learn a lot of shit
His up's, His down's, His strength's, and His weaknesses
And usually, Motherfuckers think wit their dick
So I put a twist in the game and called my bitch Britney
Woo, She said she need spiritual guidance
And he the only one that can show her how to truly find it
He told her meet him at his private quarters at ten o clock
And here begins the intricate plot
Now Britney had this grimy motherfucker wide open
I stepped to him, Pulled the heat, And told her to get ghost
I hit him once in the chest and laid him flat
The second one was to the dome cause the company requested that

[Chorus]

[Therapist]
