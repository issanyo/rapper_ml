[Intro:]
What the hell is really goin on?

[Verse 1: LD]
Look here I dip, I swerve, I sip, calm my nerves
Solid gold thug money, big karats, bugs bunny
OG boss Jack Tunny, back hand slapping up young dummies
S-C-R-U-B an, all bloody but I ain’t bleeding
We war? I’m cheating, mean junkyard dog eating
Legz Diamond no cristola stay strapped with 9 pistolas
Pop champagne, blow whistles, throw cabbage endless fist fulls
So Juggalo I’m shit loads, I love neden holes though don’t forget those

[Hook:]
I’m so fresh
In a world that’s so stale
What the hell is really going on?

LD, 313, Purple Gang crime family
LD, 313, Purple Gang crime family

[Verse 2: LD]
White chocolate paint, shoes blinding
I slide up she climbed in huh, married two timing, loves how I’m cut
Once was a broke scrub, off the radar coke sub
Shut it down I pulled plugs, even had to choke thugs
I’m hooked on feddy, cream, fuck methamphetamine's
Clock bank a steady stream, gold rings and everything
Peep even when I’m sleeping, my glow draws the sheep in
Strapped cause creepers creeping on look out my pit bulls peeping

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cold 187um]
Fresh like a new pair of Jordan's
Fly like a Chevrolet, shining like a hot summer day
Here’s how I get the party started
All I need is two chicks, a fifth and it’s popping regardless
I get money at an extreme measure
How you think I stay so fresh and sip the finest?
Packs a Tommy gun like Legz Diamond
I’m known to let the whole clip go when I’m riding
I’m in the paint steady grinding
I’m in the fast lane going hard haters hating how I’m shining
I’m so fresh I’m jealous of myself, I’m the greatest when I do me plus I’m Psychopathic

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Yeah, The Purple Gang
So, so, so fresh
Letting everybody know
What the hell is really going on
