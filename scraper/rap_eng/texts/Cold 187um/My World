[Intro: Cold 187Um Talking]
You know, it's been ten years in the making
And we're working towards ten more years to come
Putting it down with that serious hustle, you know what I'm saying?
Above the Law, this is our world
So while we up in here, KM.G, why don't you set it off?

[KM.G]
Can y'all relate with this one? - dwelling on the night before
Waking up kind of salty on my homie Koas' bathroom floor
Picture this, 30 niggas, Lexuses, Benzes
And at 12 O'Clock, we gon' do it again
And tell the world how them`Clinic must be toasted
Forever low-riding, loving life, West coasted
Jump into the shower, make sure the ass is clean
Funky fresh A.T.L gear, you know what I mean?
Pump my stereo, so Hutch, hit me by the studio
Listen to my niggas from the block, local demo
Some Donna Karan, or Joe in the air
When they mix with some Chronic, them hookers don't care
GS-ing while I'm thinking about some hoe shit
No question, I'ma flip my funky flow shit
I show shit, niggas know the time, cause they killed a crime victim
Yes, we choose the lick, get the homies then we stick them
Yeah, don't get mad because you bought a fake chicken
Maybe next time, y'all can do the goddamn licking
Aww yes, we spends your ends, and we spends it good
We're copping, having OG's in the hood
With all the rats that you know
And all the hookers that you used to go to school with
Yeah, they're all counterfeits
So relax and just chill and play the role
And be another girl getting sexed in my world

[Chorus] (x2)
[Female voice:] Do your hustle, play your game
[KM.G:] In my world
[Female voice:] This is your world, this is your world
[KM.G:] In my world

[Cold 187Um]
So why don't you take a toke off the Endo
And step into my world?
Top down on the side, double O as I hurl
Situation's kind of sticky on the dove side
So when I who-ride, keep it on the love side
Straight P-Town player for life, I told you before
Fool, I'm rolling fat, you better ask your whore
Cause she be knowing how the Clinic patrol
She be my top notch hooker when she on a stroll
It's kind of cold, but if you put it in perspective
Either you respect this, or either you get checked, bitch
See I'm real, I'm realer than my triple gold 100 Spokes
Realer that the basis that the Ese's quote
So if you got the green eye, with the triple beamer
Call me up, I'll get you weight, I'll get you airtight
Peruvia, I'm trying to her
Caviar in a mansion
I'm making moves, see, I'm expanding
Cause ain't nothing in this world like being broke
I'd rather be standing on the other side of the gun smoke
And see, I never ever ever been to the curb
I puts it down, I go for mine
It's my world, for real

[Chorus:] (x2)
[Female voice:] Do your hustle, play your game
[Cold 187um:] In my world
[Female voice:] This is your world, this is your world
[Cold 187um:] In my world
