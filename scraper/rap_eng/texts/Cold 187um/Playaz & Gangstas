[Intro: Cold 187Um]
Awawaw, awawaw, awawaw, awawaw   (*Laughter*)
Yeah, we be that sick, sick-Ass-Clique
Called Above The Law, right back at you (*Laughter*)
Yeah, ugh, ugh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beatin' down your block, checkin' in your spot
And it don't stop
Like I said before we do our thing from L.A. to Oaktown
Pomona style, yeah, so check it, I'ma bust it off like this

[Verse 1: Cold 187Um]
Nineteen ninety fry, back in your mothafuckin' face
Nigga step back before I catch a case
Yeah, I'm on the chase for the paper
A decade deep into the game and I'ma break you
Guarantee to take you, to the next level
Yeah, and I'm bound still slam to the flow, trick hoe
Yo, so nigga what that A.T.L like, they can't see me
When the nigga passed the Mic, check this
I'm comin' up out the mist like Romadeem
With nine full it up with the Infrared beam
Yeah, I represent that Westcoast down
For them niggas on the streets and in the Penthouse
So, put your stress up cause we're gettin' bomb tonight
And if you feel me, nigga that's right
Yo, we make the hood-rats yell out
Yo, that's the ?? will your punked out nigga pick it out
Because we be the original undisputed ones
That make more hits then humble county growth green
You know what I mean, ha ha, ugh, yeah

[Chorus: Cold 187Um]
When I run up in your spot, you don't want to see me
When I'm beatin' down the block, you don't want to see me
When your bitches on my jock, you don't want to see me
Come trippin' in my spot, you don't want to see me
Cause I'ma player, player, aww, I'ma gangster, gangster
Ugh, it's like bam bam, bambam, bam bam, bambam
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Ugh, it's like bam bam, bambam, bam bam, bambam, yeah

[Verse 2: Km.G]
We dwell in level, my kinfolk peep me, to the real
Homie Diomands last forever, and troops stay together
If it be that way, then we'll drink Cartier
The Low-riderin' niggas that'll get your ass to Alazhay
I'm in it, gotherin' Pimp Clinic, they're partyin' to me baby
Did a lick with jack move, now we hell of shady
Just heard about pervin' as we bounced to the Bay
And we still servin' yay, the old fashion way
Pomona is the house, check it out
South Central is the house, without doubt, we turn it out
Crimin-als, hustlers pay us now
All we wanna do is flip a chicken and a half of cow
Yeah, we're ready to kick the monster Jam
And we're on the West, and all the rest of y'all got the script
So back up with all that bullshit y'all be woofin'
Cause y'all be curb servin' and them T's we be pushin'
I'ma pimp when it comes to them tracks
I got them twistin' hoes and bomb bitches triple in my sack
Now, quite triple in Mercedes have released them in '96 see with Caddillacs

[Break: Cold 187Um Talking]
Yeah, that's how we do it in the nine Fever
Floss mode, yeah, you know, ugh

[Chorus: Cold 187Um w/ minor Variations]
When I run up in your spot, you don't want to see me
When I'm beatin' down your block, you don't want to see me
If your bitches on my jock, you don't want to see me
I be trippin' down my spot, cause you don't want to see me
Cause I'ma player, player, aww, I'ma gangster, gangster
Ugh, it's like bam bam, bambam, bam bam, bambam
It's like bam bam, bambam, bam bam, bambam, ugh
