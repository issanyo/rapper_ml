Life goes on, I mean last year was a good year
But not a great year!
I mean umm, it was a good year
Because umm.. we accomplished a lot of things

You know, true, true, I mean yeah, that maybe true
But umm, its not what they know its what they can prove
No, no, I mean I once knew a player
Who umm, woke up on the right side of the bed
You know, he was living fly and had all these fancy things
But when he got greedy, the nigga played himself
You know, on the next day
He woke up on the wrong side of the bed, umm dead
I mean, umm stepping on number two to become number one
I mean, I'm mean, we bigger than that
