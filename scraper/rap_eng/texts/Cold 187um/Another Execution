[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
See, it was seven o'clock and the sun had just set
The crew rolled up and said, it time to jet
I was kinda hesitatin', cause it was nothin' to do
But we always find something to get into
Total K-Oss broke out, he said let's go to the movies
He was payin', so I wasn't bein' choosy
Jumped in the ride and proceded to go
[K-Oss] Yo, what are we goin' to see?
[187um] Yo man, I don't know
But when we got there it was a quarter to nine
To see the main flick it was a long ass line
Paid to get in and not a second before
A sucker looked me up and down at the front door
Now I shined on and walked on in
But he kept on starin' again and again
I walked up and said "what's up"
He said "not you"
I turned around and then I looked at my crew
Because I know he didn't say what I thought he said
And if he did I'm gonna have his head on a platter
The suckers scattered when we got ill
The brother who tried to front, he got his cap peeled
And his homies they got mad
But they soon broke out, because of what we had

[Hook: Cold 187um (Dr. Dre)]
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start blasting
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse
They say nothing's confusing
Why? Why? Why?
(It's just another execution, just another execution)

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
See it was early
We was bored uptight
So we rushed up to In-and-Out
To get a bite to eat
I saw a freak I hadn't seen in a while
The one with the crazy eyes and the pretty smile
She was def you know what I mean
The ho was stacked to the max
In a skin-tight jean
She sat across the room and try to stare at me
Then send a note about how she wants to get with me
Now I'm wonderin' what has changed
Is it that I'm rockin' the house
And that I'm makin' a name for myself
Cause when I first met her
All she said I did with her was upset her
I think that sneak she's tryin' to play me down
Cause I ain't the one that likes to be clowned
So I told the ho to leave me alone
I said girl you need to take your stuck up ass home
At this second her boy walked in
I said man do I have to act crazy again
Then I grabbed my weapon it's time to get ill
You can say it is cool or you can straight get pilled
With buck shots I mean all over the place
In your back, your side
In your stomach, in your face
Cause I don't really care what your girlfriend says
If you keep talkin' shit you get a bullet in your head
So anyway what your beefin' about
If I wanted your ho she'd be already turned out
She's jockin me
She might go with you
Now checkin' your girl is what you need to do

[Hook: Cold 187um (Dr. Dre)]
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start blasting
I go total loco like a crazy assassin
I look at my posse; they say nothing's confusing
Why? Why? Why?
