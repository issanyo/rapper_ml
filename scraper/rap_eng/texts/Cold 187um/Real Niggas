[Verse 1: Sandman]
You wanna cop find the time get in line nigga
The work "" self I don't search for no flippers
Simple and plain fish scale ruling the game
So you can come for hustle can get it from the lame

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Shame on he who goes against the game
Get down or lay down they be in the game
Niggas pays taxes them bullets they gon' back flip
Headshot knock his whole world off it's axis

[Verse 3: Ab Liva]
Drug dealer tactics turn it into potsy
Practice makes perfect get drains let it drop
It will supercat getto red hot on the corner
I'd be most wanted how we got cross the border

[Verse 4: Malice]
Maria and the graces put it in the ??
Never what we tell like La Costra Nostra
'45 my side bitch chillin' in my holster
God father shit like Francis Coppola

[Hook: Sandman]
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging with the bitches is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

[Bridge: Sandman]
I mean you wanna be replaced I replace you
You understand me? Other than that
Come over here show me you ??
Gimmi' them long big kisses
Is you trippin'? bitch
You know how easy it is to lose one fathom down pillow

[Verse 5: Sandman]
My dreams fullfilled, my hood on tilt, my home on stilt
Nigga plus I fell like I'm choppin' for cars, when I must drive
Mostly, I bulldoze you while I'm chauffeur

[Verse 6: Pusha T]
Ferro gun with loafers
Mash gas pedals as I'm sitting in the glass like I'm motherfucking coaster
Smile as I pray on you niggas like I paoch ya
Cruise no worries through a city full of roaches

[Verse 7: Ab Liva]
Pistle no holster there's a war outside
Got a chip on my shoulder and a stomach full of ulcers
Throat full of Coca the rest is in the sofa
I'm close to hittin' off the masses like Opra

[Verse 8: Malice]
You can pay twelve that's what I sell ??
The whole for seventeen is what I let it go for
Then we split the difference I ? with my co-?
Pride in my product I'm a connoisseur source

[Hook]

[Break down]

[Verse 9: Sandman]
Now that big load has came in
Got them bricks on the skid
Nigga just say when
In the bed with my bitch I hit  ?
Then the plane gon' land
Exact change get them veins in hand

[Verse 10: Pusha T]
Cook it till it tan, in Pyrex like Peter Pan
Get it in the jiffy I peanut butter the purest grams
Underhand pitch like little Leak in Japan
I got 'em running bricks, like I send the ball in the stand

[Verse 11: Ab Liva]
It's like in a tunnel I ? understand
Nikes ? Louis Vuitton duffle bag
They like to see a player dead in the streets
Fuck it I'm sky-high gettin' head on the beach

[Verse 12: Malice]
With a bad bitch that I'm at overseas
She favor leash I call her A keeds?
I just played it cool she felt me like AC
And the Jewels don't hurt you see I'm NHD

[Hook]

[Outro]
It's our world man can you have it?
We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3
The spirit of competition
We just stay we the fuck better
We have a gang album
Comming this spring
New Clipse album coming October
Sandman solo album coming soon
Liva solo album coming soon
We top of the world on you niggas man
I know it hurt you
I know it hurt you motherfuckers man
But what we are supposed to do?
We Got It 4 Cheap, Vol. 3
Ain't no fucking competition
Pusha turnin' that shit signin' off
