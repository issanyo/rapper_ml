Every afternoon i go inside
These bitter walls
And I'll open up your eyelids
To uncover what went wrong
I know its true what they say
You can't get on everyday
When it all comes around in a circle
Last night
While you were sleeping
I never noticed this before
How i even want you more
When you are right here
In time I hope you will find out
That everything that i have said
Was in your best interest instead
What i wanted out of you is not my fault
Ive never felt so in love with
Ive never been one to tell the truth
Ive never felt so alive
Cause i wanna know
Why it feels this way inside me
How you feel when your around me
I wanna know whats going on
