[Intro] (sample)
Now, listen you communists and niggas and jews
Tell all your buddies to spread the news
Your day of judgement will soon been nigh
As the Lord in his wisdom looks down from on high
Will his battle be lost by mixin' the races?
We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces
Never, never, never, I say
For the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay
Never, never, never, I say
Cause the Ku Klux Klan is here to stay
These Ku Kluxers are better with lynchings than with lyrics

And you have to fade your strap, cause it's like that

[Hook: Cold 187um]
Yeah, ugh, since we in here, man
Won't you set some shit off man before we get the fuck outta here?

[KM.G]
Oh shit, we wicked
I swear, I'll sweat your ass
Yeah, the clinic came to blast
We lookin' for them fake gangstas
They handing out the murder raps
Yeah, they're shakin' suckers like craps
Shit comes to pass, nigga
I hope you're not a victim of a raper
And let a nigga take your paper
And run, and live life swell
While you're rottin' and rhymin' in a cell
Now break yourself, nigga, how the hell you figure?
You used to need gas, money, hope
Yeah, I guess the G's are full grown

[Cold 187um]
Yeah, now it's time to play the motherfuckin' clown

[KM.G]
You're actin' all stupid like you don't know where we been
We buyin' a gang of gats, so tell a friend
"Tell them"
And God put us here, to innovate first
Now the world's given, Uncle Sam's Curse

[Cold 187um]
See, I don't trust man, nigga, only trust God
So when it's on, bow down to the black mob
I be the dark skinned'd nigga representin' from Pomona
In the ragtop trey, on them gold 'tonas, yeah
Cause I'mma floss for mine, and I'mma toss for mine
To let you know, that it costs for mine, yeah
Cause I'mma come like a true nigga
And for lunch, I think I won't fly twice, nigga
Oh shit, oh shit, we're goin' off the deep end
We y'all off the hook and we're flowin' like the wind
I'mma take off on your ass like a LearJet
And if the shit gets deep, you gonna get wet up
And out of luck, tryin' to fuck with the original
I used to slang dope, but now I get residuals

[Hook]
