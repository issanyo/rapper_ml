Yo, this is somethin new by notorious-ass Above the Law
In the motherfuckin place
The Illustrator KM.G
Yo 187, you gotta let em know what's goin on

[ VERSE 1: Cold 187um ]
See, I'm like a psycho, I meditate with a beat
I add a rhyme, to make it sound complete
I go into a state of mind that I very seldom enter
To put it on a black plate of wax with a hole in the center
Understand, I'm not the greatest
Above the Law is always funky fresh and we will never be the latest
Look at that, we're two steps ahead of you
I just simply get up on the mic and do what some MC's are scared to do
Go for the gusto, if so
Yo, I keep my hat cut low
I'm a friend, not a foe
A pro, as a artist
Give my hardest as the farthest
That'll take it up the ladder
See, it really doesn't matter
Cause oppositions I will scatter
This I call rhymin, yo, not chitter-chatter
Like Malcolm X, see, I be takin a stand
A man with the plan makin you dance
On the dancefloor, more
Of a new style that's worth your while
It's from Pamona
So you know I had to lay this shit on ya
Hit the switch, then rewind this shit
Grab a 40 ounce and go mack to a bitch
Now ladies - please don't be offended
Because my lifestyle is hustlin, and see, I'm in it to win it
Yo, what could I possibly be sayin
Man, when I do it like that?

Yo, drop your lyrics

[ VERSE 2: Cold 187um ]
See, I'm livin large, I clock dollars from day to day
And on the weekend go out for some play
I'm like ballin with the untouchable HBC
Real brothers that are down with me
And if I call on em, you're gonna pay the cost
Because they're puttin out contracts for you to get tossed
Muffled, broke on, we throw you in the river
Cement shoes, so that you sink much quicker
Cause me, I gotta have it, one way or the other
I'm takin out your family, your sister and your mother
And your brother, undercover I got to keep ass clean
And when the shit goes down I'm nowhere to be seen
You know - what could I possibly mean, Dre?

[ VERSE 3: Cold 187um ]
Now see, I have to break it down like on a funky tip
So you don't wanna slip or trip or maybe go overboard
You can't afford to ignore this style
Above the Law steady housin em, change the dial
I don't smile, I always keep a serious face
So if this beat is that funky, why don't you pump up the bass?
And fall into the groove like you're supposed to
But not too deep, because we got another show to do
This is dedicated to my brothers and sisters
The white, the black, and all the hip-hop listeners
One nation stayin under a groove
Above the Law's pure in it to win it, we don't lose
I'm not a new jack that smoke crack, don't play me like one
87's got the power, if you wanna, come get some, son
I think your status is weak, you'll never compete
But I don't have to sweat it, cause my posse's just too deep
Yeah, we kick ass and take names and remain the same
We live large while you sit and complain
I have to break it down to all the people I know
]From L.A., New York, Detroit and Chicago
Oh, I can't forget Dallas and D.C
Miami, Florida, St. Louis and Philly
But back to the subject of rockin and jockin
Makin it funkier than funky, keepin you hyper than hype
Makin you hot, so hot you wanna drop to your knees
Make the whole damn nation catch a deadly disease
Cause when I rhyme, I makes a killin
And if you haven't seen our show, you don't know the feelin
(Word) that's all I gotta say
I'm just smooth kickin lyrics
