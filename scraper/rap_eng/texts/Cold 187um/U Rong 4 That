Boo yow, time for me to spark up the scenery
So tell me what you need for a bitch like me
To get loco, insane, psycho, no brain
How ya want it? I serve it all the same
More sherm like some bomb ass chronic
When it's dipped in a gallon of water, know what I'm sayin'?
But I don't touch that shit 'cause that'll stun ya
But see me, I'm doper than the whole country of Colombia
So buck buck to all the players in my clique
'Cause the B-L-A-C-K M-A-F-I-A
Already done sewed up, umm half the shit
(Yeah, so motherfuckers deal wit it)
Come on
So now I'm screamin to you has-been hoes
Who been tryin' to get ya stripes back but see ya comin' wack
I need some elbow room, I need some fuckin' wall space
So I can make ya wanna free base, yo (Yeah)
And then ya all O.D. on the shit
Cos I be kickin' some bomb ass lyrics
So get hip to the G-Funk, pop it in ya trizznuck
And just roll because it helps
I ain't really sayin' that I'm all that
But if my lyrics is fat, then label me that
Sick of too many motherfuckers they try to label me like a sucker
But I lace more mics than Nike sells Flights
'Cause ain't nobody givin' away props
And if ya beggin' for em, you need to stop so ahh

[ChorusCold187Um]
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
Tell me is she wrong

[Mz. Kilo]
See now fools be suckin' that plastic
For that fast hit, but they pass quick
And niggas be smokin' that home grown
But you should leave it alone and get a hit of the indo homes
See it's straight elementary loco
I gotta move some weight, so I can't choke
'Cause if I choke, I'm goin' up in smoke (Ugh)
So I'm a open the fire and go for broke (Ahh)
Because my lingo is like a gang of, the proper yayo
You can flip it and flip it and then it grow (Ahh)
That's why they call me the K-I-L-O, ain't nothin' mellow
But the flow, and my funky (Hello)
So let's take em to the flow zone
While they get their rolls on, get their proper rolls on
'Cause I'm a hop it like a Deuce with twelve switches
And clown on you punk bitches
'Cause I'm not blowin' up niggas' pagers, niggas is blowin' up mine
And I might slip in on you suckers like I said in my rhyme
It's like I'm turnin' on the light and my roach is clear
Guess what? That's how I'm feared
Because the clip is in the motherfuckin' Glock
When I'm all on your ass is when I stop so ahh

[Chorus]
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
Tell me is she wrong

[Mz. Kilo]
I got flavor, better yet about thirty one of 'em
And if I choose to give you some then nigga you're a lucky one
'Cause this ain't a game that I'm playin' to lose
'Cause almost only counts in grenades and horseshoes
So swing to the funk as your ears poppin'
And if I was in the pen I'd have a teardrop
Fool
I ain't comin' up in second place
I carry a Glock in my purse, don't expect my fuckin' mace
'Cause I don't wanna a hollow, wait
I holla buck buck buck, puttin' slugs in your fuckin' face
Mz. Kilo goin' psycho
At night with a pistol, sippin' on Cisco
And like I said I got the shit for ya
See I'm half way through and I still owe ya, ugh
'Cause I'm a take you back like good friend
(Like mom's fried chicken, greens and cornbread)
See black people need to be proud to be black
And white folks need to quit holdin' us back
They say "We Shall Overcome" but we ain't come up yet
I got the ends, the ends and not the respect
So think about what's really goin' on
While I'm livin' next door in a bigger home so ahh

[Chorus]
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
'Cause she thinks shit's done with the gangsta tone
Tell me is she wrong
Tell me is she wrong
