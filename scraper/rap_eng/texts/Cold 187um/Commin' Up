[Intro]
Comming live and da-da-direct

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Coming back at em' with a dope sack
4 niggas in a cut up cadillac
Yo, up and down, front and back, side to side
That's how it is in Cali if you're gonna ride
I'm on my corner, so it's best that I be strapped
Cause niggas out in Cali don't give a fuck if I rap
But for now, I plan to leave them switches alone
Pull and swoop you like my ends from the riches I own
See cause 80 percent of the time
I don't do nothing but hustling
The rest of the time I write rhymes and keep bustin'
See my homie boulavard told me gold to go
It don't take nothing but a word from me to pimp a hoe
So at the age of 15 I had a room and a stable
Bitch don't say shit just put my money on the table
Cause big wages make a litte nigga pull rank
So O.G's you best think twice if you're tryna' gank
Cause if you do end up shit outta luck
Yeah, cause he really don't give a fuck

Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
That's how it is to me
When i'm tryna come up
That's how I live G
When i'm tryna come up
That's how i'm suppose to be
When i'm tryna come up
Don't get close to me
Cause i'm tryna come up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

(why why why)

The sky's the motherfucking limit
Yeah, i'm always out to get my stack on
Ah, funk players in the house
Come again funk players sing it, yeah
The sky's the motherfucking limit


[Verse 2]
Yeah
I guess I'm like a villian in black, yo
Cause I don't give a fuck about the nigga's I jack, yo
Cause his bitch is now my bitch
And the nigga who snitch
He found dead in a ditch, yo
You wanna know why I had a Murder Rap
Why I had to write it and why I had to recite it
It's more deeper than the average gang banger
Cause me and my crew are much more than just dope slangers
We sold Ki's, we sold Ki's
That's gonna {flocks them?}
Niggas still talking bout' nine's
I'm gonna Glock ya'
So clock on, so clock on
Till I can't clock no more
Then after that maybe go find my hoe
So if you ever out in Cali
Best believe you have big bank
Cause these bitches out in L.A
Will put your status on point

Nothing but the motherfucking stars
Where the niggas in the ghetto got the flyest cars
Yo, niggas ballin from here to Mississippi
Hittin the corner, back and forth
A couple of times just to make a quicky
Now people tell me how will it ever stop
With the players out of town kickin 30 ya' a pop
No, I do my thing from Frisco to Maine
I even got some shit sowed up in Sweden and Spain
Yo, so I guess I'm just a player with luck

Nah, just wasn't giving a fuck

[Hook]
That's how it is to me
When i'm tryna come up
That's how I live G
When i'm tryna come up
That's how i'm suppose to be
When i'm tryna come up
Don't get close to me
Cause i'm tryna come up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

(why why why)

The sky's the motherfucking limit
Yeah, i'm always out to get my stack on
Funk players in the house
Come again funk players house
Sing it for em' yeah
Uh, yeah
The sky's the motherfucking limit
Yeah i' m always out to get my stack on

[Verse 3]
On to the next city
Out of town through the [trials?]
With my man toe truck willy
He was a mack but from way back
Him and my dad was 2 hog's pushing a 'lac
I was only 8 years old
They put me in the middle, and we rolled
Collecting from the bitches on the stroll
Paying punk ass cops off
From being on the pay roll
Yeah, going to the gambling shack
Playing pool, running them numbers
And maybe shooting crap
If a fight broke out my pop's would tell me, peep
Before the shit gets deep
You gotta pull your heat
Because you never ever know
What the next player peeps
Cause niggas be thinking they hoeing
{never they had them, never they keep?}
You can bank em'
But then you have to shank em'
But think you're only provoking
So now you gotta smoke em'
Yeah, cause the {O.G's sit out
And then new comes in?}
It's like a never ending story
Again and again and again


[Hook]
That's how it is to me
When i was tryna come up
That's how i'm living G
Cause i'm tryna come up
That's how it's suppose to be
When i'm tryna come up
Now get close to me
Cause see i'm tryna' come up

That's how i'm living G
When i'm tryna come up
That's how it's suppose to be
When i'm tryna come up
That's how I's suppose to be
When i'm tryna come up
You don't fuck with me
Because i'm tryna come up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up


The sky's the motherfucking limit
Yeah, uhh, i'm always out to get my stack on

It's a mad, mad world
The black mafia life
