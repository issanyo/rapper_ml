[Verse 1]
The setting
Is a cool breeze day
Word takes place in the city of L.A
I'm 9 years old to be exact
Checkered bell bottoms, brown shirt
With a dusty ass cap
Goin to the ABC market
Had to get some new biscuits
2 dollars what a bargin
Preceding up the street
While I'm humming a tune
The first time I witness
Somebody's tryin' a jack move
If im correct it was a el'co
Tryin'a jack a '6-4
Nigga's tryin ta tip-toe and yo
Pointing at gauges
Tryn'a take a brother's ya'
He saw what was up
Got out the vehicle and bailed
He just had to run in my direction
But they smoked his ass
Now he's next to the sports section
But the nigga dropped the ya' on the ground
So then I picked the shit up
Ran down and around the corner, yo
And through a nearby alley
Escaped through a tiny gate

I was a nickel slick nigga [x4]

[Verse 2]
Huffin' and puffin' but I finally got to the pad
My mother asks where I was at
I said
"Yo, I was over Snowy's house
Playin some marbles"
She believed what I said
So I went to my cars
You see I shared rooms with my cousin
That was mentally slow
But he was a big as fuck
6"5', 300 pounds or more
Nicknamed 'Big Truck'
Took the sack out my pants
Unravelled the product
Told my cousin we gotta hustle and bustle
To make money back
I make connections
You watch my back
Set up a program
Called the lemonade stand
But I wasn't sellin drinks
I was sellin big bands
And bundles and boulders of doves, yeah
At this time I was gettin more pub, yo
From this cluck and that cluck
And everybody wanna cluck cluck
But me and Truck
We didn't give a fuck
But the spot got hot, police raid
They took Truck to jail
But me I got away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
4 years past, now I'm 13
Bought me a duster
To go undercover
My cousin's jail sentence was almost finished
Now we back in the streets in a mix
In it to win it
Pulling cards, checkin fools
Checkin names down
Now my status was ballin'
Was set to the ground
Other hustlers knew I was doin my best
Cause I was a baller young ass nigga from the west
Had a pimped out crib in Pomona
Not far from the city
So that way I can hit corners
Now who would expect this little juvenile punk
Straight ballin y'all
As they kept on falling for it
It was a smooth operation you see
Cause I had the luck
Your whole fuckin family would love me
5 years swoop now I'm 18
Sold a lot of product
So they start calling me Kokane
At this time i was bustin' funky rhymes
Hook the shit up with '87
Now I'm gettin mine
Lay Law was in effect and he said "let's do this"
Gave my shit to E
Then I signed with Ruthless
But Truck was left on the spot
Hmm, what do
Hooked a nigga up with that cocaine rock
Now Truck was gettin paper from the yayo'
Me, I'm gettin paid for my motherfuckin' record sales
So there it is, a player getting bigger
I guess I joined a whole organisation
Of nickel slick nigga's

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yo Stan, won't cha play something nickel slick for a nigga right here
