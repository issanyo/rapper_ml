[Intro/Hook: X2]
People came in by the load
Encore, encore
People came in by the load
Ooh, when love is strong

[KM.G]
Yeah, y'all, I felt the need, I had to let you all know
How Above the Law flow, we keep that funky gangster ratio
Yeah, we're taking our time, cause patience is a virtue
Plus, we ain't in a hurry, to motherfucking hurt you
Peep, we checked in, date in 1989
Intertwined with some chips to sign
On the little dotted line, it was lovely and the Dineros was clean
Different from the crack money, but green was green
Fresh on the scene, niggas didn't know the time, we're enterprising
But never realising how the criming and the rhyming would twist
And make a hell of a mix
Had the neighborhood fiending like some junkies before a fix
Half of Cali' came to get with the source
They did after we down, players could have their own choice
Either rap singing, or even street singing
It didn't make a difference long as the funk you're bringing
Everybody's down with the Pimp Clinic
But all they wanted was a piece, piece of the streets
And we be all up in that ass with the quickness
The thickness, yeah, funking the set from here to the East
This is a player thing, this ain't no fucking bullshit
Because we pull shit
My name is KM.G, I'm from the Clinic and the Park
You either get glocked in the dark, or get sparked
Yeah, I had to change my wives, change my ways
Straight cut the strays and live for better days
Low ride and slide through the street
A real nigga ready to eat
Rolling tough with the Glock on my seat

[Hook]

[Cold 187Um]
Yeah, now I done travelled around the world and said a million rhymes
Like with N.W.A. back in '89
I put the C in the controversy in the industry
Like Eazy-E and Ice-T
Yo, I did thousands of shows, I dissed many faces
I deal with new jacks, on a way out basis
I put it down with the true crew
We're leaving player haters mesmerised when we trip through
[KM.G] How many suckers you know?
Well, I know a whole truck full
I'm trying to stay two steps ahead of that bullshit they're trying to pull
Motherfuckers claim they hard
And putting half to work, and did half the dirt
Ain't even from the turf
What I would do if I was you, is shut your fucking mouth
Cause we be moving keys while you're playing house
I'm the original, rap murderer
See, I can beat your ass, rock the Mic
Or fuck your girl on a good night
Cause from Pomona to S.C
I represent the real niggas that do the who-ride with me "Yeah"
Yo, on the real, I got skills like a fifth degree black belt
Plus, I'm ten times more explicit than the Sculpt
Niggas making schemes and gimmicks to sell LP's
Instead of being real and stacking G's
Yo, ugh, I'm like a fool at a house party
If I'm heated, I'm fucking it up for everybody
[KM.G] What's your name, nigga?
Awww, you don't know?
Yo, it's Mr. 187 with my dick all in your whore
Yeah, if she wanna encore
Yeah, She won't know, it won't more

[Hook: until fade]
