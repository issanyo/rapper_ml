{Intro]

*You know who the realest is niggas*

Death Row, Mobb Deep killa, Havoc and Prodigy
The strong gone rob em, you niggas know
Remember how me and Swoop G mashed on you
Bitch ass niggas at the Soul Train Awards?
That's Death Row style nigga, from Tha Realest

[Verse: 1]

Narrow point blank range them niggas fire shots
I caught the bullet then I seen this nigga light stop
It was a set-up and them niggas didn't even know me
But I'm Tha Realest so them motherfuckers owe me
Crooked bitches, I seen the rise and fall of No Limit
I told you motherfuckers first that shit was a gimmick
Fuck C-Murder them niggas ain't never heard of a murderer
Like Tha Realest them niggas can shoot as much as they want
But they can't kill us, the illest and sickest nigga to tuck Death Row
They say "there's no place like home" then there's no place to go
For sure that when we ride we ride nigga by all means
Drug niggas and dreams and smoke em like fiends
And it seems that all this niggas tryna ride like us
Poppin X like us but in the end they die fast
Mobb Deep killa, Havoc and Prodigy
The strong gone rob em

[Chorus 2x]

Them niggas claim that they the Mob
But they can't Mobb Deep
Sickle cell niggas die in their sleep
Fuckin with me, now who you rollin with?
I spit the realest shit
And til the day I die them motherfuckers
Can't Mobb Deep

[Verse: 2]

I heard the world screamin that I sound like Pac
Please get it straight I ain't stealin from Pac
I'm fuckin ridin for Pac
And when Mobb Deep fuckin dropped Thug Life is mine
Why no body motherfuckin replied?
I think them niggas scared [?]
I got a .357 and I'll make your heart [?]
And at the Soul Train them niggas ain't do a damn thing
Swoop G was kicking ass while I brought the pain
It was proclaimed and then them niggas hesitated
Mobb Deep killa, when I screamed and they started breakin
This is the clearest picture, Tha Realest's gonna get ya
And when I ride my Last Circle's gonna hit ya
We all affiliated I know them niggas hate it
I can't control my little homies when them niggas faded
We all killaz still Bad Boy killaz and when you see them niggas
Tell em that they can't Mobb Deep

[Chorus 2x]

Them niggas claim that they the Mob
But they can't Mobb Deep
Sickle cell niggas die in their sleep
Fuckin with me, now who you rollin with?
I spit the realest shit
And til the day I die them motherfuckers
Can't Mobb Deep

[Verse: 3]

I got a message to send to all them niggas
That I grow up with I used to screw up with
And used to sell rocks with
Now ain't no love lost nigga but I trust no man
I relocated to the west now I'm born again
Forever lovin my block Dallas what's up?
I give it up and to them niggas that left me dead
Don't forgive what I said, how you gonna leave me
To fight your fight play my life scar my face
And see them same niggas everyday
Deport them out for me now I'mma ride for me
And before I hit believe I got the pot of money
It's the Money Organization & Business that's MOB shit
And roll on niggas who ain't with this shit
How can I get you to see?
Niggas ain't fuckin with me
My murder warrants help me plead so clearly
We gang related Last Circle initiated
Death Row for life nigga, you can't Mobb Deep

[Chorus 2x]

Them niggas claim that they the Mob
But they can't Mobb Deep
Sickle cell niggas die in their sleep
Fuckin with me, now who you rollin with?
I spit the realest shit
And til the day I die them motherfuckers
Can't Mobb Deep

[Outro]

Havoc and Prodigy killa
Them niggas ain't knowin about a real nigga
Bitch ass motherfuckers namean
I got to set this straight because
There's a lot of bullshit going on in the game right now
You niggas runnin around screamin Thug Life is theirs
And all this ol bullshit come on we know my nigga Pac
Started this Thug Life shit for you niggas
Best sit back and peep game from long range
From a duns position how my nigga Young Duvener [?]
You niggas die so quick fuckin with this real ghetto shit
When my nigga Swoop G kicked yo ass
You niggas didn't do shit
When I mobbed on you niggas
You niggas didn't do shit
So right now you niggas need to keep your mouth closed
[?] And matter of fact you niggas gotta pay a toll
To come here from now on nigga, you know why?
Because you niggas can't Mobb Deep
That's real
