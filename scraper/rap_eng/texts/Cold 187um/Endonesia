[Intro: Cold 187um]
OOOOh, wooww, wooww, stay away
OOOOh, wooww, awwoww, stay away

[Cold 187um]
Now see, I be the one with more game than Deion
Cause in the Rap game nobody don't wanna
It's started way way back
When I was servin' motherfuckers on the side of the Shack
Infact, fools wanna try to see me daily
Whether be the.. shot caller, can't nobody fade me
The untouchable, irresistible, funkdafied
Boo Yaa, I'm smokin by the ton
I come from the depth of Cali, P-Town, West up!!
What's your waitin for, light it up
I represent the crew, with that Voo Doo
What you gonna do, when we come through for you?
You better come in peace not war
Cause you just don't know when we might have a straw
I'm a type of nigga smokin' straight from the bong
If it smells like a smoke, well, I just got my smoke on
And I'mma be high like 7-4-7 with my license plate
Sayin' much love for my homie
I probably in the back of the clubs
Spittin' game meditatin, and rollin' up much bud
So we can smoke like an Indian on the reservation
And make peace in the x generation
Cause that's the way it suppose to be
And if it's up to me, homie, I'mma smoke a whole tree
I know, a lot of you really can't relate
So just ride with me, cause it's a mind state

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww

[Peeps Game]
The bass hit got my tipsy, like Hennessey
Now, tell me can you feel me?
I'm comin' strong like a soldier, I'm garanteed to hold ya
As I bust on Dojah
The snare hits me like a child with a grab bag
That's why you hooks surround my vocals like a Zig-Zag
Don't it? - I garantee you won't choke on it
I got the bomb, you got bomb, smoke and vote on it
Shit, the only time I feel gifted, is when I get lifted

[Cold 187um ]
See, you can tell by the smoke at the 4th floor see
Cause it be Cold 187um and the homegirl PG
And KM.G, rollin' up the pound
Yeah, we're stayin' down like P-Town
Yo, we roll deep when we creep on the back streets
We're checkin' player haters, we're havin' much heat
We're tryin' to keep it all real over here, man
You can't complain cause we all havin' things
You got to get up, get out and get his fates
And then maybe we all can relate, yeah

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww

[KM.G]
Welcome to the world called the beautiful place
Where niggas just dope flyin, heavenly seditated
Where in the mindstate, when you feel bigger
A little bit stronger than the average nigga
Yeah, we rather co-operate the mood and stick
Maybe get the fly bitches to Re-up on the dick
Awww shit, yeah, you know what?
I hit my nigga Mr. K-Oss to bring the cut
Brush the strap, so we can chill smoke a hell of a sack
Straight Riders and Macks, bitches gettin' table dances in the back
Invited a whole car load, the hoodrats, they wanna get wet
And I ain't bein' nice tonight, I'm mothafuckin' get nasty
Ain't lettin' one fly bitch pass me
Ho's love it when I drop it, my pimps were screamin' nigga do it
House about dinner for two, four stars caviar
Pimp Clinic Cadillac rent-a-cars
My niggas smokin' chronic outta fat ass cigars
Straight chillin' at the bar

[Hook: with Spanish female AD LIBS]
It's the place we go, where we can free our minds
It's Endonesia
It's the place we go, where everyday is fine
It's Endonesia
Stay away, stay away
OOOOh, Weeeee, OOOOh, wooww, wooww
