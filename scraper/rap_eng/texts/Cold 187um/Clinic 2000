[Intro: Kokane]
That's right, yeah, uha
Yeah, I like R. Kelly, he cool
My name Kokane, and I'm a Pisces
And I love them ho's, and they love
You understand?

[Verse 1: KMG]
Eight booty bitches in the naked city
Fly bitches shakin' asses and hell of titties
Contemplatin' how the homies should penetrate
As we watch little Tina while she masturbates
She looks up and she points to my nigga E
Then she grabs the fifth of some Hennessey
She took it to the head put the bottle between her legs
Then she brings my homie Trigga to dig
Just another freaky tale in the Westcoast
Cause after 12 O'Clock we be poppin' the most
Niggas fiendin, to slap some ass, tap some ass
And they ain't givin' a fuck about their past
Now, we got naked ladies, layin' all over the room
Life lights with the nascent fume
Though the homies gettin' twisted of that major Kiah
Pimp Clinic got them ho's for hire

[Hook]
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we have
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on every friend we want y'all
[Cold 187um] That's the world we have
[Kokane] That's the world we love
[Cold 187um] That's on every friend we have
[Kokane] That's on everybody, that's on every friend we love y'all

[Verse 2: Triggaman]
Ugh, welcome to the thrilla in Manilla
Can you relate, with the armour cap peeler?
Chillin' the most, cause I claim the westcoast
And I love givin' a toast to the bookie
And freakin on some booty
See, the Clinic got a hell of a night
Donna Karan L.A. and the fume(?) is right
Bailin' with the quickness to the freak show
Pocket full of classics and I need more ho's

[Verse 3: Enuff]
To have more whores is what a nigga pleasure
I got more moves than any whore can measure
Yeah, I put take them to the cleaners
You still callin' my mom, askin' have you seen him
But she's happy cause I'm outta state
Trip incase, peep the next holiday
Now, I wanna play with mo' ends than I can explain
What I got game, I'm headin' to the first came
Speak some words and took them home with me
Freak them with the chronic, I get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Cold 187um]
Now, I be bailin' down to show with my dick out
Ready to be this seed inside bitches' mouths
So don't you ever trip child, I come with so much stizyle
And all you bitches out there wanna know what I'm about
Cause I be hittin' back, sissies askin' have me a child
Have him grown, black, skinny, and tall
Got the conversation too, what you gonna hear, baby
How you got these niggas out here, straight livin' shady
There's one thing I know about these upon California squeezes
Yo, they be sneakin, they be freakin'
And they be down for the get down, when the gettin' be good
From Calabashies to Inglewood, you bitches know that I'm the man
Cause when I come through, I straight like jam
What y'all know about the techs flow though?
187 show, boo Yaa woow

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cold 187um & Daddy Cool]
You gotta have that with the sickness
You gotta get back on your feet
You gotta use your mind
Fuckin' with a nigga like me
You gotta have that with the sickness
You gotta get back on your feet
About to lose my mind up in these streets

[Hook]
