[Intro: KM.G Talking] (x4)
Looking for that good stuff "V.S.O.P"

(x2)
Very fine, yeah, V.S.O.P, V.S.O.P, V.S.O.P ohhhh come on

[Verse 1: Cold 187um & KM.G]

Alright first off then let me introduce myself
I'm the C to the O-L-D 1-87
Oooh, I hear that, the player with the speech
'Cause it's me, KM.G, more flex than a sex on the beach
Ah yes, my brother, takes two to tangle
And since we got them where we got 'em, we better use the right angle
So I'mma push, push in the back of the bush
'Cause it's a wonderful for feelin'
Yeah, 'cause we got the goods for ya suckers in ninety-deuce
The whole pot of gumbo, the whole gallon of juice
So I'mma ease up on 'em, real quick, watch me hit 'em
Well that's all in the ratio of what we hit 'em up for
'Cause when I'm on the dice, I hit a seven comin' out
I'll take your car, your woman, your whole damn house
So now, I step with the quickness (Yeah)
I flex my ends into my Benz and let God be the witness
Oooh I'm finna teach you how the body slam, let me show ya
But step into my world, I got somethin' dope for ya
So holds on, to my woody
And don't be scared when we do the butt boogie
Yeah, it's like bump bump, buh-buh-bump
That's the sound of my heater when the ill stuff jumps
I keep it strictly confidential, bulletproof is requested
Got the fifth in my hand and I've already blessed it
So toast to the boogie, G, 'cause I'm C-O-L-D
The beat is kinda humpin' and I'm tipsy
'Cause everything is on the one, it's a natural high
When I get to the hook of the joint, you know why

[Hook: KM.G]
Everything is fine
When you're rollin' with your homies and a little bit of V.S.O.P
All the niggas gettin' high
With a whole lot of chronic and a gallon of the V.S.O.P
If you wanna feel fine
Free your mind take a couple of mega shots of V.S.O.P
Now you gotta get hype
And you turn into G with a little bit of V.S.O.P

[Verse 2: Cold 187um & KM.G]
To G or not to G, which is the answer?
Out of control, then sold your soul
Yeah they're schemin' on the big hit, and tryin' find a quick pick
Lookin' for the real shit
(*tires screeching and car crash*)
Hold up, but that's counterfeit
On the real, the funk don't appeal
You think you got clout, but you're really down and out
So hold on tight, as we take you down the runway
How many, how many times I got to tell you I don't play?
Oh, and if you didn't know
I had to change my pattern 'cause I roll my ride around the rings of Saturn
Oooh, yeah get in like Venus
See it's been like '89 since the last time you've seen us
Tell me, my peoples did you miss me, on the real
We was never paper champs like Holyfield
Yeah, vision this, that sucker tried to sky me
When I'm hotter than Kuwait or a California earthquake
'Cause I got the munchies for your love, so come and kick it
But you better come prepared 'cause it gets kinda wicked
Yeah, 'cause you can walk the plank if you're schemin' for my bank
Don't play me like a trick, yo, my name ain't Mick
'Cause everything is on the one, it's a natural high
When we get to the hook of the blunt, you know why...

[Hook: KM.G]
Everything is fine when you're rollin' wit' your homies and a little bit of V.S.O.P
When I was at the mall the other day I saw some honeys and I offered 'em some V.S.O.P
Now the party was poppin' when a brotha bailed in with a gang of V.S.O.P
At the end of the jam, you should all run out and get a gallon of V.S.O.P

[Outro: KM.G]
V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P
V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P.-] (*whispering*)
V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P.-] (*whispering*)
V.S.O.P. ohhhh come on, V.S.O.P. ohhhh come on
Uh uh yeah, come on, V.S.O.P. ohhhh come on
Very fine, V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P

(*explosion*)
