Serving all my rocks

Cause I got the dope that they want to know better
See a cluck here wanna get some shit on credit
But you already owe me ens
And your going to go more in debt
I'm in a generous mood
I'll give you two days
To get my motherfucking sheets
And if you don't they'll be beef
Cause silly silly clucker get ya ass home to ya kids
Cause ya motherfucking wrong
For leaving them kids alone at home
I see some niggas at the end of the alley
Around eleven of them men are coming towards me
I won't mall ya or nall ya?
Scared stiff ya'll
My intension was to flap my words?
And get motherfucking ghost
Yo, now they up to no good
Cause I was clocking big jackers
In they motherfucking hood
One nigga straight pulled out a machete
But then I broke like a motherfucker
Heading for my Chevy
Went around the corner to reload on they ass
Yeah, ya'll all know the rest
