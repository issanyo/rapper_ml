[Intro]
Take some time off
You'll be contacted again the next time you're needed
For now, Take a break, You've earned it

[Chorus]
Back in the smog in the thick of it all, The only place I know
(City Of Angels) Home, Sweet, L.A. L.A
I hit the town and i do it all, The only place I know
(City Of Angels) Home, Sweet, L.A. L.A

[Verse 1]
Now back to the turf
Man I'm feeling good as a motherfucker for what it's worth
Sunshine beaming up my bald head
Man I could be in jail or dead
Instead, I'm out here dippin hittin corners
From South Central Compton to Pomona
I looked up, Not a cloud in the sky
A perfect day to just get out and lowride
Not a care in the world
I'm dippin, Politicing wit somebody girl
Lady's stacked, Thick as a motherfucker
She love it when a gangsta fuck her
Smashing, Heavy on the gas
Pop my collar at a bitch when i dip pass
The mood is right, My swag is on
Damn it feels good to be home
L.A. L.A

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now back to the smog and the palm trees
Feelin good, California breeze
Smoking on some kush
And you know it's the bomb like the bitches I fuck and the whips I push
I'm never losing
A top player in the game that keep it moving
Dippin in my Chevrolet
I get treated like a king everywhere and everyday
I took a look at my cardiae
I told Tanny if she wanna play I'll be there at eight
And you know I do it way big
I'm a high paid killer, How else should I live?
Pockets on fat, Dick on hard
Gangsta motherfucker in charge livin way large
The mood is right, The swag is on
Damn it feels good to be home
L.A. L.A

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now back to the grind of it all
Where a gangsta shines and shot calls
Where everyday is a party
Where the players do it big and the bitches get naughty
And don't get caught up
You better have your strap on deck in case you might have to bust
Just let the 24's glide
And turn the shit way up and feel the vibe
Blow big and ride hard
I'm official, Top dog on the yard
Classic like the body on the six-deuce
I blast quick for whoever need proof
I let it be what it's gon be
Drop the top on the deuce and dip through the city
The mood is right, My swag is on
Damn it feels good to be home
L.A. L.A

[Chorus]

[Violent J]
After a short trip home for some time off
Cold 187 was called back to work
This time for one of the bloodiest jobs he'd ever been contracted for
The elimination of the treacherous Casey Brothers
Recently marked for unspeakable crimes
The location: Ecorse, Michigan
Just outside of Detroit
