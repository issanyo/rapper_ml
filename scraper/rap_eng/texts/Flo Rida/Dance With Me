[Intro]
Now would be a good time to come under the open space area
Under the colourful lights and wiggle your body to the beat of the music
In other words, dance!

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I know you wanna dance with a star
Flo Rida, Aaron Carter, baby
Hey, I know you wanna wanna dance with a star
Turn the lights down baby, yeah we going hard
Party all night little mama, that's my job
Steal the show girl, like somebody got robbed
You do your thing, I'm the life of the club
Watching my swing, are you down to adjust
Swerve in my lane girl, I won't make it tough
I like your friend, let me show you what's up
Hold on the function gets liver
You ready for the heat, I'm bringing that fire
Move to the beat, get down with Flo-Rida
You could join in, cause the shine is much brighter

[Verse 2]
Turn the lights down
Nice and low
Everybody movin'
Tonight on the floor
Let's party right now
I'll let you know
You got my body burnin' baby outta control

[Hook]
I could be your favorite
Tell me whats your sign girl
Perfect picture painted
Number one on mine girl
You got me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the way you do your thing, baby
You like my swing
And I know you wanna dance with me
They'll remember who you are
'Cause you're dancing with a star
And I know you wanna dance with me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're dancing with a star
Promise I could take you higher, higher, higher
'Cause you're dancing with a star
We're gon' set this night on fire, fire
Oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
You got me heated
When we're dancin' close
Girl, I know it sounds conceited
I'm the one you need most
I know you need it, need it
Show them who we are
Everybody's watching like we're superstars

[Hook]
Tell me what's your flavour
Do you like mine girl
I'm intoxicated
Without the wine girl
You got me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the way you do your thing, baby
You like my swing
And I know you wanna dance with me
They'll remember who you are
'Cause you're dancing with a star
And I know you wanna dance with me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're dancing with a star
Promise I could take you higher, higher, higher
'Cause you're dancing with a star
We're gon' set this night on fire, fire
Oh oh oh
We gon' set this night on fire

[Bridge: Aaron & Flo-Rida]
We gon' set this night on fire
Come and dance with the stars
You ready for the heat, I'm bringing that
You ready for the heat, I'm bringing that fire
We gon' set this night on fire
Come and dance with the stars
You ready for the heat, I'm bringing that fire
You ready for the heat

You got me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
You got me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Come and dance with a star

[Pre-Chorus]
I like the way you do your thing, baby
You like my swing
And I know you wanna dance with me (I know you wanna dance with me, yeah)
They'll remember who you are
'Cause you're dancing with a star
And I know you wanna dance with me (I know you wanna dance with me)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're dancing with a star
Promise I could take you higher (Promise I could take you higher, promise I can take you higher)
'Cause you're dancing with a star
We gon' set this night on fire, fire
We gon' set this night on fire

[Outro]
'Cause you're dancing with a star
Promise I could take you higher (Promise I could take you higher, promise I can take you higher)
'Cause you're dancing with a star
We gon' set this night on fire
