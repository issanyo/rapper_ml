[Intro]
Follow you to anywhere, follow you, follow, follow you
Follow you to anywhere, follow you to anywhere

[Verse 1]
You and me got a chemistry that cannot be compared
And every time I'm with you, girl, it's outer space, maybe I'm out there
Can you do anything to make me leave, baby, I doubt it
Wherever you go won't you take me yeah, and baby, I'm bout it
'Cause I follow you to anywhere

[Chorus]
If you go, baby, then I know that I will follow
If you say let's go there, baby, let's go there, 'cause you know I don't care
And where we go you know don't mean a thing as long as you're there
'Cause if you go, baby, then I know that I will follow, I follow you to anywhere

[Verse 2]
Some of my friends tell me damn, she's got your nose wide open
See, I look like a love sick puppy, I gotta be choking
Well, I just know it's right in front of me and I gotta show it
And if they had this they'd do the same thing and baby you know it
I'll follow you to anywhere

[Chorus]
If you go, baby, then I know that I will follow
If you say let's go there, baby, let's go there, 'cause you know I don't care
And where we go you know don't mean a thing as long as you're there
'Cause if you go, baby, then I know that I will follow, I follow you to anywhere

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, every little step you take
I'm willin' to make the same move shorty
I can be your shadow
Fill up my Louie suitcase
If I gotta make a move, all aboard, yeah, I'm ready, we can travel
It'll never be a hassle, anywhere you go, girl, I'm there 'cause a battle
Rare that a king hardly ever leave his castle, baby, anything for you if I gotta paddle
Hey, whatever floats your boat, I'm open
I'm right behind you, shorty, like chase behind gin
Like 9:59 a minute before 10, I'll be your copycat like Siamese twins
After you, girl, like today and tomorrow
I got a pilot that's always on auto, sexy that's what you'll be my supermodel
Across the world and I'm willin' to follow

[Chorus]
If you go, baby, then I know that I will follow
If you say let's go there, baby, let's go there, 'cause you know I don't care
And where we go you know don't mean a thing as long as you're there
'Cause if you go, baby, then I know that I will follow, I follow you to anywhere
