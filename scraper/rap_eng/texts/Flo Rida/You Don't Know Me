[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I've been on the couch, even slept on the floor
But you don't know
Ate off the dollar menu, when I was broke
But you don't know
Ran through Miami all on my own
But you don't know
If it wasn't for the music man
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Cos I kept grindin', hustlin'
Tryin' to make my way
Not knowing, If I'd ever, make it
Make it to this day
But I told myself
Nothing happens over night
Now you see the diamonds and the bright lights
But you don't know who I am inside

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
You don’t know me
You don’t know this pain
You don’t know me
Or how I got this way
Until you’ve been where I’ve been
Or seen what I’ve seen
You'll never, never, never know
You will never know me

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida, Delaney Jane]
Uh, you will never...
Uh, you will never know me
Uh, never, never, never know
Uh, Cos you will never know me

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Lost a lot of homies tryin', to get this far
But you don't know
So you ain't gotta ask, Why I go so hard
But you don't know
See all these tattoos cover, all my scars
But you don't know
You don't know my end, you don't know my start

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
You don’t know me
You don’t know this pain
You don’t know me
Or how I got this way
Until you’ve been where I’ve been
Or seen what I’ve seen
You'll never, never, never know
You will never know me

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida, Delaney Jane]
Uh, you will never...
Uh, you will never know me
Uh, never, never, never know
Uh, you will never know me

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Cos I kept grindin', hustlin'
Tryin' to make my way
Not knowing, If I'd ever, make it
Make it to this day
But I told myself
Nothing happens over night
Now you see the diamonds and the bright lights
But you don't know who I am inside

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
You don’t know me
You don’t know this pain
You don’t know me
Or how I got this way
Until you’ve been where I’ve been
Or seen what I’ve seen
You'll never, never, never know
You will never know me

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida, Delaney Jane]
Uh, you will never...
Uh, you will never know me
Until you’ve been where I’ve been
Or seen what I’ve seen
You'll never, never, never know
You will never know me
