[Hook]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 1]
It’s like Woodstock city, brand new villain
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrix
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll
Come on let’s go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain’t ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

[Hook]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
Roll is on, everybody come to get the taste of the bomb
Feeling wild shopper when you’re bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of its own
Love while I’m sposed to look around and it’s gone
Love while I’m sposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, I’m already gone
Let the good times go
All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, like I'm singing hey yo
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll...

[Bridge]
And let’s go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let’s go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast for the good times
Where they last forever, we’re youngs, yeah the good times
Raise your glass, let’s all have some fun

[Hook]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin' why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
