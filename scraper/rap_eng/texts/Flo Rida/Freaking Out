(Hook)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

(Verse 1)
Oh my god, you got me in, and we can’t get out
Eenie meenie minie mo
It’s too easy I’m freaking out
You are the medic, I know your anatomy
It’s like a movie, should win an academy
I throw a salary, up when you strut at me
When there’s a policy, send a recovery
Heaven is like, give me a break
I give you some of that, (...)
Catching all on video tape
And play back the highlights tomorrow

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?

(Hook)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)

(Verse 2)
I plan to get white boy wasted
The villain in my face took a vacation
A lot of goons see me know I ain’t chasing
The room spinning ing ing ing
And I’m done
Shot like shark, bang bang, that’s a gun
I shoulda auditioned for hangover 1, 2, 3
Oh no, bartender said, you want a drink, oh no
On the side, never ever ever ever drink again
That’s it, drinks, so I will sip again
With a headache, throwing up slurring
Sex on the beach (...)

Too much alcohol
Too many women every night
It’s a replay
What’s happening?

(Hook)(x2)
Oh, my god, I think, I'm freaking out
Too many drinks, too many rounds
I'm in the clouds, no coming down
(Dude I'm totally freaking out)
