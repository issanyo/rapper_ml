[Intro: G-Dragon & Flo Rida]
Flo Rida
YG Family
G-Dragon, holla at ‘em
You’re my heartbreaker
DJ, and YG (Be right back)
Let me take this over

[Verse 1: G-Dragon]
I don’t fall behind no matter where I go
Don’t you dare test people’s hearts
I don’t have anything else to say
I know you and I are long gone loves
The number of times I got down on my knees and begged
In those moments, That’s who I hate, you
Enough is enough
Bye now, bye again

Flo Flo Flo Rida and G G G-Dragon
No matter how desperately I hold you back, no matter how hard I cry
Hold back the lie that you love me
The guy who turned his back, his heart is cold
The girl who was left behind, her mind is numb
The cold morning breeze rushes by
It’s over, you know what I mean

Shawty got low low low low low low low (It’s the wickedy joint)

[Chorus: G-Dragon]
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
What was it that I did wrong
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
No way, no way
Even if you leave me, I won’t accept it
Let’s see how well you live on your own (Lovers and haters)
I’m sick, sick, sick of it, It’s broken, broken broken
You say my love is pathetic?
No way

Flo Rida (whoop whoop) talk to me

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey I know everybody ain't perfect
Baby what did I do to deserve this
No way, you’re making me nervous
I can’t afford to be climbing your circus
Like why did I open the curtain
Gave you my heart when I should’ve been certain
Knew I was allergic, I need a surgeon
Tryin’ to be another person
This wasn’t part of the plan
Leaving each other I don’t understand
More than your lover, your permanent man
Won’t be another that can do what I can
Right on the double I gave you my hand
But for the trouble why do it again
I cannot juggle just being your friend
After this trouble my heart needs a mend (a mend, a mend, a mend)

[Chorus: G-Dragon]
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
What was it that I did wrong
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
No way, no way
Even if you leave me, I won’t accept it
Let’s see how well you live on your own (Lovers and haters)
I’m sick, sick, sick of it, It’s broken, broken broken
You say my love is pathetic?
No way

[Bridge: G-Dragon]
I’ll still still be there, on your phone that’s been turned off
I’ll still still be there, in the mailbox in front of your house
I still feel the same, even if I’m nothing to you now
I will still be there

Baby, I feel like I’m going to die without you
The person I was around you, it wasn’t the real me
I’m sorry, Take my hand one more time, for me
I’m waiting for you

[Chorus: G-Dragon]
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
What was it that I did wrong
You’re my heart heart heart heart heartbreaker
No way, no way
Even if you leave me, I won’t accept it
Let’s see how well you live on your own (Lovers and haters)
I’m sick, sick, sick of it, It’s broken, broken broken
You say my love is pathetic?
No way

[Outro: G-Dragon]
I’m out
