[Verse 1:]
Damn Somebody Tell Me Why The First Girl I See When I Walk Up In The Club Her
Ni**A You Told Me That You Was Gon Make Sure I Wasn't Gona See This Girl
No Not Tonight, I Wanted To Give It Time, I Wanted Her Out My Mind
Now It's Too Late To Leave
Damn, I Wonder Who That Is She's Talking To... He Put The Drink Down Now He's Makin A Move, I Wonder Where They Movin To
And Just Like A Fool I'm Watchin Her
Tryna Make My Eyes Deter
But I Can't Stop Watchin I'm Watchin
Said I Can't Stop Watchin, I'm Watchin

[Pre Chorus:]
Now The Only Thing I Feel Inside Of My Chest Is All This Regret
I Never Should Of Let You Go, Why'd I Let You Go
This Situation Is Under My Skin
There's A War Goin On Within

[Chorus:]
This Is How I Feel Everytime I'm Around You
I Just Lose Control When I'm In The Same Room
I Get So, I'm Sooo
Emotional, Emotional, Emotional
[Repeat]

[Verse 2:]
So What Do U Think?
Should I Roll Up, Like I Do It On Dubs
Show Her What It Is, Make Her Miss My Love
Yea Reminisce On Us
Look At Me Stressin, So Caught Up
Learnin My Lesson, I Realize
(But Now It's Lookin Like It's Too Late)
Cause He Just Wrapped His Hands Around That Slim Waist
That's My Waist
Please Don't Tell Me She's Dancing The Same Way
She Danced With Me
Man That Could Never Be
That's What She Said To Me
That's Why It's So Hard To Believe

[Pre Chorus:]
Now The Only Thing I Feel Inside Of My Chest Is All This Regret
I Never Should Of Let You Go, Why'd I Let You Go
This Situation Is Under My Skin
There's A War Goin On Within

[Chorus:]
This Is How I Feel Everytime I'm Around You
I Just Lose Control When I'm In The Same Room
I Get So, I'm Sooo
Emotional, Emotional, Emotional
[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
Hey Girl, Didn't See Ya Standin There It's Been A
Long Time, It's Feelin Really Good To See Your Smile
(Every Once In A While) I'm Thinkin Of You And Me- E
But Life Is Good I'm Free-E Yea
Wait! Baby I'm Frontin Honestly I Made A Big Mistake
I'm Struggling With Reality, It Hurts More Everyday
I Been Blaming You For Makin Me Feel This Way
And Now I'm Crushed Without Your Love

[Chorus:]
This Is How I Feel Everytime I'm Around You
I Just Lose Control When I'm In The Same Room
I Get So, I'm Sooo
Emotional, Emotional, Emotional
