[Intro (Spoken): Flo Rida]
Damn, that white girl got some ass!

[Hook: Flo Rida]
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it
Tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Ooh, I think I found one
Cause I got that fever, look
Britney got herself a round one
Ass like Serena, that's okay
Cause I love my stereotypes
My girls in twos
That maximum exposure Rosa
Know what I wanna do
Telling all the girls, all around the world
My last name must be Robbins
Cause I'm baskin' in these asses
All thirty-one flavors keep calling
My-my-my-my vanilla Cinderella
Love when I tell her "drop it"
My butter pecan Rican
But I-I love my chocolate

[Hook: Flo Rida]
And I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it
Tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Refrain: Flo Rida]
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
She got that badonkadonk-a-donk-donkey
Thang so fat, thang so chunky
Call me Michael Jackson, he-he
Cause I love to play with monkeys
It's a Miami thing, that's right
We down for anything, that's right
You do everything, that's right
Flo Rida, Pitbull, and the gang
I'm off the chain-a-lang-lang-lang
Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira esa gringa con toda esa nalga de dream
Como tu sabes estoy loco
Pero que bueno que era poco
Mami mueve los cocos
I don't care where you're from
As long as you got that bubble bum

[Hook: Flo Rida]
And I can't believe it
White girl got some ass, I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass, it ain't a secret
Baby, turn around, I wanna see it
Tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Refrain: Flo Rida]
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Now turn left
Turn right
Turn around, you could tell
What I like
She look good
She so bad
She pick it up, drop it down
Look back

[Refrain: Flo Rida]
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum
Bubble yum bum
Badum-bum badum

[Outro: Flo Rida]
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Badum-bum badum
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Badum-bum badum
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Badum-bum badum
I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Badum-bum badum
