[Intro: Liz Elias & Flo Rida]
At night, I think of you
All night, you're rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh
At night, I dream of you
So don't stop rocking my body
Rocking my body, babe
Flo Rida
Ayo, Liz, you know I'm the life of the party

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Girl, I'm loving your body
I wanna see you make it wiggle
Start with the top and then
I'mma meet you in the middle
I'm certified, I'm certified, I'm the one
If you ready to party, we party all night long
Give me a minute, I'll touch your nose wide open
Give me another, I'll give you everything you hoping
Give me a call, I'm on the way on the 10
I'mma dive in and we can do it again

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
If you down tonight
You know I got it, you know I got it, yeah
I'll be rocking your body, rocking your body, yeah

[Chorus: Liz Elias]
At night, I think of you
All night, you're rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh
At night, I dream of you
So don't stop rocking my body
I wonder if you know, boy, do you know
That I got you on my mind
Secret admirer
So don't stop rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Come with me, now roll with a rider, no doubt
Go with the flow, don't you know I put it down
Mr. Internationally known
You're number one, but I got two phones
Both of my numbers
They work in and out the country
Love when you work it
I'll bring you back in that 'Mazaki
Give me a call, I'm on the way on the 10
I'mma dive in and we can do it again

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
If you down tonight
You know I got it, you know I got it, yeah
I'll be rocking your body, rocking your body, yeah

[Chorus: Liz Elias & Akon]
At night, I think of you
All night, you're rocking my body, rocking my body, oh
At night, I dream of you
So don't stop rocking my body
I wonder if you know
Boy, do you know that (Uh huh)
I got you on my mind (Yeah-yeah-yeah)
Secret admirer (Akon)
So don't stop (Oh-oh-oh)
Rocking my body (Yeah)
Rocking my body, oh

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been around the globe
I couldn't find no one quite like you
You're the one I wanna hold
And won't let go, don't ask me too
All the things in your bed, I'm 'bout to do
All that's ran through my head is thoughts of you
Ooh, move that ass on, girl
We ain't got much time
Cause we got a lot to do
So if you with it
Let me hear you say it, hell yeah
Baby girl, if you with it
Let me hear you say it, hell yeah

[Chorus: Liz Elias]
Baby, at night, I think of you
All night, you're rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh
At night, I dream of you
So don't stop rocking my body
I wonder if you know, boy, do you know
That I got you on my mind
Secret admirer
So don't stop rocking my body
Rocking my body, oh
