[Intro: Flo Rida]
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Baby girl, I want you to keep on puttin' on a show
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, let's go

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Mmm da da oh oh
Shawty, got it jumpin' around and I'm thrown
And we gotta couple of rounds of Nuvo
Everybody lookin' around like, uh, oh
Okay, whatcha say? Let's play
Shake it with a little bit of Beyonce
Turn around and give it to me, shawty, get paid
Do it for them girls, they be jealous anyway
On stage I wanna be amazed
Pop that, drop that, it's ya birthday
Top that, got stacks, work for this stage
Stop that, lock that, work it in place
You the best, shawty, don't be scurred
Let loose get a Louis like hers
You the truth, get money, it's yours
Back it up like that, yes, sir

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
Oh, oh, baby, want some more, baby?
I love the way you do it cause you do it so crazy
I'm countin' down so turn around
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, now make that booty go
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Baby girl, I want you to keep on puttin' on a show
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da, let's go

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
It's your sexy that got me now
Willin' to bet they can't shut you down
I'm impressed the way you makin' it bounce
Workin' the middle again, makin' it jiggle again
Hello, let's go just know
I love the way you do it, how you take it to the floor
Show 'em how you do it like you ready for the pole
Baby you can do it fifty times in a row
Them rows get ready for yo' pose
Lights, camera, action, lose control
Ain't got to practice, you's a pro
All types of magic, lose the clothes
Gotta party like this yo' world
Make yo' booty go stupid, girl
So hot and I love them curves
Off top, shawty, mark my words

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
Oh, oh, baby, want some more, baby?
I love the way you do it cause you do it so crazy
I'm countin' down so turn around
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, now make that booty go
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Baby girl, I want you to keep on puttin' on a show
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da, let's go

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
I don't have the words to say
When you shake it my way
You got me st-stutterin'
How can I make you stay?
I don't have the words to say
When you shake it my way
You got me st-stutterin'
Stutterin', stutterin'

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh

[Outro: Flo Rida]
Oh, oh, baby, want some more baby?
I love the way you do it cause you do it so crazy
I'm countin' down so turn around
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, now make that booty go
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Mmm da da, mmm da da
Mmm da da oh oh
Baby girl, I want you to keep on puttin' on a show
Mmm da da, oh oh
Mmm da da, let's go
