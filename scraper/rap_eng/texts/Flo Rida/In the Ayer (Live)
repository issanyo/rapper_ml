(Chorus x2)
Will.i.am
Oh hot damn , this is my jam
Keep me partying till the A.M
Yall don't understand, make me throw my hands
In the ayer-ay-ayer, ayer-ay-ayer

Flo Rida
Hey this is my jam
Yall don't understand
I'll make you understand
What's pumpin in my CD player (player)
Party all night like yayer (yayer)
Shawty got her hands in the ayer (ayer)
Make me want to take it there
Then I go "here I go yea that's my song"
DJ bring it back come in my zone
I get paid for them couple bones
The next wop until the early morn
I need that crunk when I'm up in tha club
Even my Chevy that pull up on dubs
Give me that drop yellow waist like a drug
Lil mama hot and she might show me love
Oh hot damn celebrate to tha A.M
I love it so much it got me sayin

(Chorus x2)
Flo Rida
Hey I just might start the wave
Like I'm at a ball game do my thang
Hands up high got money in tha bank
I'm so fly 747 plane
Rock it no stop it how I got my name
Baby keep poppin you might get tha fame
Walk tha red carpet won't see you the same
I get tha stuntin forget my name
Start with me
Ride with me
Represent and vibe with me
Make me
Throw it up ma timid in tha club
Go ahead throw it up
Gotta wonder how much
To show enough to stare (stare)
I'm hood so its really unfair (unfair)
Shorty go ahead and get bare (bare)
We treat our city like the mayor (mayor)

(Chorus x2)
Will.i.am
Alright now stop (oooo)

It's a stick (a stick up stick up) its a stick up touch the ceilin' baby

Put your hands up to the sky (to the sky)
Wave em, wave em round and round, side to side (side to side)

And we got em bottoms poppin' at my proof
So throw your hands in the ayer (ayer)
Touch the ceilin' baby
Fell it, feel it baby
Throw your hands up
