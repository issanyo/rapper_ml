[Intro]
And you never heard a sound like this before
Back, still hot, and you want some more?

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I said that c-c-can't be her's
All that bottom b-b-bottom
Then again, that might be hers
U-up top and get my dollars fo' sure
Then I meet my mama let's go
Think about this girl all 24
My mind, her whistle she blow
Make me wanna li-lick her below
I talk about her, shawty fly
I wanna-wanna be the pilot
Perfect girl, shawty shy
And I can't keep silent
Tell my brother, my ex-lover
All my homies and my uncle damn
There she is, I'mma be quiet
Listen carefully

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I-I can feel her love, she's a model, super model, I know
Look at that-that strut, that Coca bottle, b-b-ottle, hello
Just know shawty on point like, elbow
We can flip a coin and I want both
Her head, her tails, I'm obsessed with this female
And her chest like, oh, jewels
She's so blessed, mmm-mmm she smells
[?] than a mother- I almost cuss
This girl make me wanna fu- I mean cut
Action totally, it's some attraction
Mmm! There she go again
Come here girl! I even be talkin' to myself!

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on

[Bridge: Flo Rida (Kevin Rudolf)]
So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on (on and on and on)
So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on (on and on and on)
So fine, you're the one (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on (on and on and on)
Got me goin' on and on (on and on and on)
On and on and on (on and on and on)

[Chorus: Kevin Rudolf]
Even got me talkin' bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on 'bout you baby
I just wanna take you home tonight
And, oh, that body's got me talkin' crazy
Got me goin' on, on and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
