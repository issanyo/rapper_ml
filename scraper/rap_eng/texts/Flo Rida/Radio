Well I'm talking 'bout a hometown
A little party back in the pines
I'm really thinkin' 'bout your house
And your couch, and getting some
On a Saturday night

When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah

Well I say a little hey baby (hey baby)
What's your number and where you from
I'm really thinking about you baby
And the first crazy night I got to get you home

After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah

When I'm singing 'bout
Whiskey, summer, spring break, lovers
Shirt hanging off a tree
I'm thinkin' 'bout
Brown skin, blue eyes, pink toes, red sky
You hanging onto me

After the drive-in, the kissing
The leaving, the missing
You're everywhere I go

'Cause you're the girl on the radio
The radio, everybody singing 'bout you tonight
You're the song on the stereo, the stereo
We got you turned up just right
It's all rock and roll, and solid gold
Flashing lights and rolling smoke
Stuck in their head, but they don't know
I know, you know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah

You know, you're the girl on the radio
The radio, yeah
You're the girl on the radio
