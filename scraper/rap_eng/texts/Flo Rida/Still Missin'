[Intro/Hook]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
Plowin the world but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
I'm 'bout to lose my head cause my ho still missin
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Verse 1]
I take care of the yard, everyday, I don't know why my ho got missin
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my ho to get up and get missin
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt I done saw for myself and witnessed
Boy I'd tell you about my ho, never had restrictions
I guess more green was her attention, I shoulda kept that ho in the kitchen
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission
I'm sheddin tears messin up my vision, this ho gon' make me go to prison

[Hook]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
Plowin the world but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
I'm 'bout to lose my head cause my ho still missin
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Verse 2]
That ho cost me my job, I'm afraid I shoulda learned mo' 'bout the business
A ho is good for diggin, I shoulda known this from the beginnin
I done got caught slippin now I'm trippin
Out the do' somebody else found interest
On my ho until I found out until I find out different
Better to know then have intuitions
Who been in my yard, why would anybody split us apart~?!
I never thought that ho would get to my heart
I found out right off a bitch can't pull apart
Why this ho went in somebody garage?
I was a gentlemen right from the start
Ever since I put the ho in my Dodge
Now this bitch won't even spare me the rod

[Hook]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
Plowin the world but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
I'm 'bout to lose my head cause my ho still missin
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Bridge]
Seven years now it's all over, now hold on go on you gotta feel me bruh
Left my home no sign of luck, I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone
All the pain I'm trying to pour it in my cup, bought the ho my last couple of bucks
Lost a ho I never felt this crush, like kush in a dutch - never this much
If I woulda known my ho was just temporary
And I ain't talkin 'bout the ho you find in the dictionary
I feel like goin to war like the military
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery

[Hook]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
Plowin the world but my ho still missin
My ho still missin, my ho still missin
I'm 'bout to lose my head cause my ho still missin
Like it's greener on the other side...
