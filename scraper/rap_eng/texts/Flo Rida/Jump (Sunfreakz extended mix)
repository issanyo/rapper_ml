(Intro [Nelly Furtado])
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na (x4)

(Chorus [Nelly Furtado])
When I say jump, you say how high
I ain’t never seen nobody, how they get so high
Like a bird, like a plane, this party got me insane
This party got me insane, so jump jump jump jump

(Verse 1 [Flo Rida])
Now I’m gon take it to the roof
Everybody with me got they own parachute
You ain’t scared of heights when you sippin on Goose
Party all night like I’m flyin jet new?
You ain’t never seen nobody get this loose
Shawty actin naughty with her body, what it do
Jump to this man, bump to this man
Stomp to this man, crunk to this man
Got another hit man
Hold up, I wanna go up, don’t wanna throw up
My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin high
Ask, the shawty, I’m a astronaut
High rollin baby like I’m jumpin on fire
Super Bowl pimp good Year on tire
Can I be a bird, I gotta be fly
Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words

(Chorus [Nelly Furtado])
X2

(Verse 2 [Flo Rida])
When I run up in the club, jump in, then I gotta be there
Check it out, shawty like Nike Air
Up up and away take it off like mere?
NBA ballin, I don’t care
Now what do you do when you see you a shawty and she make it bounce in the room?
Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady, can I get on your hot air balloon?
Sky high, still clubbin like I’m part of the mile high
Ears poppin, Bubbalicious help me get right
Keep poppin in position after midnight
Moese? fried chicken up in NY
Jigga what, don’t it feel good
Houston? We gonna jump ship, all aboard
Come around me, and we’ll parlay, we’re throwed?
Cali is jumpin, hit the switch on the 6 4

(Chorus [Nelly Furtado])
(Break down) [Flo Rida]
Come on and jump, jump, jump (x3)
[All my ladies] get down, get down, get down
[All my ladies] get down, get down, get down
[All the fellas] jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
[All the fellas, the ladies, the fellas, the ladies, let me see you]

(Chorus [Nelly Furtado])
X2

(Break down)
Get down, get down, get down
Get down, get down, get down

(Outro [Nelly Furtado])
