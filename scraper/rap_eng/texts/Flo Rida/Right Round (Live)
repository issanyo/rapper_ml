You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey, walk out the house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control

Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' 'bout clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry, that's always on, whoa

I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies it's on
Then pop in the night 'cause this mix'll be ours

We keep a fade away shot 'cause we ballin'
It's Platinum Patr√≥n every hour
Lil' mama, oh, you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goody power

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Hey, shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like a number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my fans
My Benjamin Frank-a-lin's

A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my (plan)
We buildin' castles that's made out of (sand)

She's amazin', fire blazin'
Hotter than cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster

I'm in a daze, the bottom is wavin' at me
Like "Damn it, I know ya."
You wanna shoot like a gun outta holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your gopher

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down down

Yeah, I'm spendin' my money
I'm out of control (hey)
Somebody help me (hey)
She takin' my bank roll

But I'm king of the club
And I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down down
Down down down down down down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round (hey)
When you go down, when you go down down (hey)
You spin my head right round, right round (hey)
When you go down, when you go down down
