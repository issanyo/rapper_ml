[1st Verse: Brolos]
I'm gone off the Henny
Niggas do what, I say so
Them girls they K.O.D
On my payroll, they meet me
When I go to live on Sunday, yea
Blow a lot of money, yea
Tell em to bring all the bottles and smokers, yea
Bitch you wanna know where we headed
When we all go to wet Willis
Spring brand hoes, they be doin the more
Girls be kissing girls all day
Pop, brought me out to the jetski
I know a lot of bitches wanna catch me
Go to the hotel
And bring all the girls
And your dick they be loving
We do it all over again

[2nd Verse: Flo Rida]
Touch down on that soul plane
Hunnid grand, Cuban link, gold chain
When that sun hit dice, it do the salsa
Cha Cha Cha, soul train
Jet pack, I'm like James Bond
Pussy galore, my Veyron
I go to finger-licking
With a chicken, know the limit
But the chicken tryna hit it
Like hit and run
I'm on it
Mile high club in the morning
High high when you're high
When you're high, high I'm pulling
My vibe come alive
Suicide, don't want it
305 high its fine like a fried my balony
Won't tell her like Tony
Big booty meat, just that's my testimony
Ion let my circle
I'm hot pepperoni
I still fly commercial
So, I am Rich Homie

[3rd Verse: Brolos]
I just landed in Miami
Doing what young niggas do
Benihanas on my plate
But I'm far from a silver spoon
Coming through the club with my team
Like I'm Scooby Doo
Riding in my Shaggy everywhere
Just like them Hoovers do
I can't even blame em
They just wanna fuck with winners
I knew she was the one
Soon as I snatched her offa Tindr
I'm like oooooh
In Miami for a week
Lets make a moooooove
It's Gutta Twins
And you know that we gotta do
