[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words, I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
All out, turn the beat up
Hey now I'm glad to meet ya
Turn up girl, blow the speaker
Yeah up, think about it now, blow the speaker
I'll speak louder, let's get wild tonight
Billionaire bottles, we just down 'em like
Ain't no problem, all my roads are right
All right, all right

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
I don't like it, I love it
I got another comma in my budget
I got a anaconda in my Trukfit
Don't push it, don't push it
'Cause I'ma hit it til I jackpot, that's right
Wax on, baby, wax off, act right
You can put it on the black card, all night
And I'll spend it, I'll spend it cause

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words I just go
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
