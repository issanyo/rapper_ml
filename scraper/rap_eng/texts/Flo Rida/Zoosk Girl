(Hey, Hey) No wasting my time, She gotta be Zoosk, Walkin' it, Talkin' it, know she the truth
All the way down with a freak attitude, Whether you're loose when she walk in the room
Swingin' them hips like you ain't got a groove, Hell of a giver, she sweet as perfume
Fully equipt with that body in tune, Lil' mama is drippin', she hotter than June
I gotta have her no way can I rest
Make her my diva, want only the best
Babies no teaser, I look to impress

Good Ladies they help me get rid of my stress

No top for close, No bottom the dress, Only one goal, that's showing her flesh
Shortys the fly'est chick in the nest, She gotta be Zooskin', nothing less..
