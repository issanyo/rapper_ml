Look at the reaction when I hit em in the front
Got fleezy in the back and chello in the front
Listen to the record boy I got what you won't
Beatz so fly cuz the club on chomp
Got hizz like woofs beatin in the back of the door
Ladies take it back throw back the joint
Bend at the waist, lean to the front
Now BOUNCE yo body to the, just a little bit harder
Shawty move yo feet just a little
Ain't nobody here wop better than me

Man listening to the beat who better the me
