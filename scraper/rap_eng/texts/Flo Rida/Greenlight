[Refrain: Pitbull]
Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
Give me everything you got
Red light, green light

[Intro: Pitbull]
Mr. 305, Flo Rida and LunchMoney
Three Miami boys, you know what time it is

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
We only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Ride out now, ride out now)
Give me the green light

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I got the green light mami and you know what that means
That we can do anything, anything that you dream
I wanna make you ooh, ah, till you scream
And I practice what I preach, if you know what I mean
I'm about that mami
Yeah I got the key and I'mma lock that mami
Yeah, we can roll and I'mma rock that mami
I do what I say and say what I mean, now let me jump in between
I'm getting loose in this thing, like OJ the Juice in this thing
Feeling like Left Eye, boy, I burn the roof in this thing
I got all the women getting naked, feeling like Luke in this thing, think it's a game
Now I got the green lit and the green right
All I need is, mami, for you to give me the green light
So I can run through it like an EZ pass
Find the G-spot and step on the gas

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
We only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
(Ride out now, ride out now)
Give me the green light

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Baby, I got the Midas, I'm Flo Rida
You know I'm all about that thing, that thing
If she ready then I'm ready
Pull up on her with the Chevy
Real talk when that light turn green (Let go)
Give me what I asked for, I got a passport
Mr. International, I hit the airport
If you knew the kind of work that I transport
That Rihanna do me dirt to the crash course
I like the cleanest, greenest, leanest
Serena, Venus, Flo a Genius, smokin' Phoenix
You never seen this
I have her dream this that 200 on the dash, got me feenin'
So I'm tryna ride out, slide out
Grab the stripes, then the 500 bye bye
Wild out, shout out
Beehive, hit the honeycomb hideout, ayy

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
We only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
So give me the green light, give it to me
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm ready to go, oh, oh, oh
Wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, wee-oh, oh, oh
Give me the green light

[Refrain: Pitbull & LunchMoney Lewis]
Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
Give me everything you got
Red light, green light
Everybody take a shot
Red light, green light
What you waiting for?

[Hook: LunchMoney Lewis]
Give me the green light, oh yeah
Cause I'm ready to go
Let's have a good time, let's go
What you waiting for?
We only got one life, one life
And we gon' live it up
