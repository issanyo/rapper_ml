[Intro]
This time we going in
Gonna get get what, get wild
So grab somebody 'cause nobody going home tonight
Say round one's on me, everybody cheer it up
Say 5, 4, 2, 3, we're about to tear it up

Go back and forth, break it to the floor
Now ladies show your talent
Let me shake it lleft, where the fellas at?
Point her out if she the baddest
If you know like I know, something's goin' down tonight
And no, oh, oh, oh
Don't make me have to say it twice

[Chorus]
Oh you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
Oh, you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down

This night's so interesting
Everybody falling out
If you looking good and you're feeling great
Then you should shout this out
Say ay ay ayo, everybody say it now
Say ay ay ayo, everybody say it loud

Go back and forth, break it to the floor
Now ladies show your talent
Let me shake it lleft, where the fellas at?
Point her out if she the baddest
If you know like I know, something's goin' down tonight
And no, oh, oh, oh
Don't make me have to say it twice

[Chorus]
Oh you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
Oh, you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down

[Bridge]
Up in the spot just floatin' around
I see lil mama them broking it down, all over the ground
Said the beat got them doing the bounce
Repeat, shorty ready to clown
Let loose, DJ killin 'em up in that booth
Love when a woman is shaking that goose
Must get enough to have an excuse to tear off the roof and not get the boot, oh no
What you mean to do right there?
Shorty got her hands in the air
She ain't seen none of them girls
(Shorty) bring that ass over here

[Chorus]
Oh you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
Oh, you in trouble, you about to get it
Head to my corner, come and let me fix it
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down
You broke broke broke it down, you broke broke it down

[Outro]
To the right, to the left, put some boogie in your step
You ain't with it then you might as well go home
Now all my dogs up in here, sexy ladies everywhere
You the truth, let 'em know who won the show
