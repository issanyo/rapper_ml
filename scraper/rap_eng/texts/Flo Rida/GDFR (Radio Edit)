I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Flo Rida:
You girl just kissed a girl
I do bi chicks
Shake for a sheik
I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spendind this As-salam alaykum
Peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches
Surfboard in high tide
I could just roll up
Cause I'm swoled up
So that birthday cake get the cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold bra
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's
I set records, ratchets hold up
(I set records, ratchets hold u)
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Sage the Gemini:
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah, my girl you never seen her
Cause my tints by limousiners
And my touch say it's the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My yeam blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough tha't's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double on tonkas
I know that you came here to see
If you're a freak, the ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Flo Rida:
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it

Sage the Gemini:
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
