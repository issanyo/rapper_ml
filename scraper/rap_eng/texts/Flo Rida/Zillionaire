[Verse 1]
I gotta ask where you been hiding
You're like a tweety karat diamond
The finer things in life were shining
How 'bout that late night wine and dining?

[Pre-Hook]
You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that 5-star experience
Yeah, show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you give enough

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
(That was perfect)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna work it to impress you
Get you that dress and then undress you
Oh, we'll do things only the best do
Do what you want because I'll let you

[Pre-Hook]
You want that expensive clutch
And I'mma give that 5-star experience
Yeah, show you the kinda love
That you can only get when you get enough

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire

[Bridge]
Abracadabra, I got the magic
I hope you can handle
Living this lavish
Let's blow a zillion, zillion, baby
If you got a passion for fashion
Engines and platinum
I got the answers to questions
So let me tell you what's happening, baby

[Hook]
I spend it all on you, baby baby, just watch
A BMW, a Bugatti, thick rock
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
I'll spend it all on shoes for you, take your own pick
McQueen or Jimmy Choo and I'll get 'em real quick
Get you a fancy yacht any chance I got
When I become a zillionaire
A little bit of you, yeah
A little bit of me, yeah
A little bit of you, yeah
When I become a zillionaire
A little bit of you
When I become a zillionaire
