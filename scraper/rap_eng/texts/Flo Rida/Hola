[Intro: Maluma]
Alright, to ride
Maluma, baby

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I just have to say
Hola, hola-la
We should get acquainted like
Oh my, oh my God
I don't speak your language, but
Hey ma', hey mama
Don't need no translation, just
Come right here, and make your body say it, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hola-la-la-la-la
Don't know what to say
Like a lollipop
Yeah, that's how you taste
Sweeter than ones in the ice cream truck
You a charm, yeah you give me good luck (Oh)
Really no need to speak too much
Oh-oh, for you make me say

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Don't put your name right now
But that need to change right now
I saw you across the room
And I just have to say

Eres sabrosura pura
Mira qu√© linda figura
Modela en la orilla de la playa
Con su gafitas Gucci nunca, nunca falla, yeah
Te quiero conocer, tell me what's your name
Vengo de Colombia, baby, if you wanna play
Te quiero conocer, tell me what's your name
Vengo de Colombia, baby, if you wanna play
