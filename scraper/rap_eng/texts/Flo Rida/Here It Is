[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow, where's the love?
Here it is

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Here it is

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, I'm back like Thriller, get up
Ready for the build up, sinner, baby, I'm no saint
I'm a stone cold winner, picture
Money where your mouth is, they can never break my bank
But the way you go, go
Now, baby, now you've got it
Turn around, you know what I want and
There's really only one thing that I gotta know-ow-ow-ow
Where in the world you're droppin' it
I got the dollars and I'm ready to sponsor it
I got the guava with the cheese, no launderin'
So pop a collar, stain killin' my confidence

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Give you that XO freebie, let's go, repeat
Come and get some of this L-O-V-E
You know what I want, I know you need me
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, let me tell you now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow, where's the love?
Here it is

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Here it is

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey, now I can tell
You the one I wanted from a mile away
Ain't nobody lookin' like you up in here
Good times written all over your face
Yeah, 'cause the way you show
Show out, show me all your talents
Whoa now, throw me all off balance
Ayy, good girl, I'm a real bad habit, uh-oh, uh-oh
Ain't no debate I'm heaven sent
I'm 'bout to take you to the places you've never been
Keep you up all night, I'm Letterman
Sick with it, I'ma bring you the medicine

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Give you that XO freebie, let's go, repeat
Come and get some of this L-O-V-E
You know what I want, I know you need me
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, let me tell you now

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow, where's the love?
Here it is

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Here it is

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
You wanna do it all day, I give you the Flo and I let you ride it, baby
Good lovin', don't play, give me the show
Oh yeah, I like the way you roll roll roll it
Keep the party goin', there's really only one thing I gotta know-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know-ow-ow-ow-ow, where's the love?
Here it is

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Here it is
