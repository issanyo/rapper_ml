You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

[Kevin Rudolf]
Well, your eyes are so deceiving
Deadly as a loaded gun
Your words are so misleading
You tell me I’m the only one

And it feels so good tonight
But it gets me every time
And I - I know I’ll never change my ways
But every single night I pray

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

[Flo Rida]
Hey, this girl make the rain drop
Giving me pain in the same spot
Go in my pockets, my wallet, I got it
She gettin my dollars the same waup

Umbrella’s lit up on the same block
The weather keeps pouring; This dame’s hot
Lil’ mamma handle herself on the pole
I can throw some more fish off the same dock

Clouds over my head
Thunder and lightening
She flashing for bread
She make a storm, I’m already prepared
Who do I want, ’cause I cut the checks
Shorty, she more the Jacuzzi with jets
They use a mop for this when it’s wet
They stop the drizzle, I walk on the set
I got the bar, girl, I’m telling you…

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

[Kevin Rudolf]
And I want you bad
So I stand in line
You tell me the lies
To keep me up all night
And I don’t even know your name
But every night I pray
Yeah…
You make the rain fall
You make the rain fall

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

You make the rain fall
‘Cause you’re so beautiful that it’s painful
Yeah, you told me that you were an angel
But I already know what you came for
You make the rain fall

You make the rain fall
You make the rain fall
You make the rain fall
