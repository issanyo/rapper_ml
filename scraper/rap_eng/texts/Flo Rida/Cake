[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
You know when I come by, you know what it look like
Everything lit, all the girls in free
Anybody inside sipping on a good time
You ain't gotta rest, they can put it on me

[Pre-Hook: Flo Rida]
When they wanna go off
They know when my money show off
I don't ever get it one way, yeah
Spend it and I get it same day, but hey

[Hook: Flo Rida]
I didn't come here to party
I didn't come here to stay
I came to leave with somebody
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake

[Verse 2: 99 Percent]
You know what I came for, I'mma throw a bankroll
You ain't gotta flex, got your mind on me
Go until it's all gone, I don't gotta say no
I can blow a check, tell me what it's gon' be

[Pre-Hook: 99 Percent]
When they wanna go off
They know when my money show off
I don't ever get it one way, yeah
Spend it and I get it same day, but hey

[Hook: 99 Percent]
I didn't come here to party
I didn't come here to stay
I came to leave with somebody
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake

[Bridge]
Cake cake cake cake, cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake, cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake, cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake, cake cake cake cake
I only came for the cake

[Hook: Flo Rida]
I didn't come here to party
I didn't come here to stay
I came to leave with somebody
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake
I only came for the cake
