[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
In my mind, I’m a legend
In real life, I'm a legend
Can't stop, never stop winning
All this money flowing
In my time learned a lesson
They don’t like when I'm living
But I can't stop, can't be finished
You already know it
A thousand of miles, top ten, independence
Show my talents will get it
No less than a living legend
I took it to eleven from an Acura Legend, ya feel me?

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it's frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
We all came from the bottom
We all came for the stardom
Started climbing the charts
And we ain't ever look back
This flyboy live no borders
Down Florida to Angola
Been down four in fourth quarters
But we ain't ever look back
Been on the top of levels since I leveled up
See I’m one in a milli-milli-milli-million
Trap is back and, damn, I feel like Serena
Hundred mill later, I feel like a leader

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it’s frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

(In my mind, in my head)

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
My life and I li-li-li-li-live it
Got no tax and no credit li-li-li-li-limits
Well I guess I did it with the di-di-di-di-digits
My watch is so freezing, it’s frigid
I winning, you winning, we winning

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head
This is where we all came from
The dreams we had, the love we share
This is what we're waiting

(In my mind, in my head)

(In my mind, in my head)
