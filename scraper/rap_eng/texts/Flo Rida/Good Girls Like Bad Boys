Ummm... Yeahh...

You're not exactly the guy I can bring home to my mama
But what she don't know won't hurt her
You're so controlling, so demanding
Like to take advantage of me
But I don't mind, no sir

You get under my skin, such a sweet sin
Just like a disease that keeps on, keeps on eating at me
I know good and well you're good for nothing
They say you don't deserve me
But it really don't disturb me

Why do all good girls like the bad boys?
Like a moth to a flame, I guess I'm back here again
Tell me why the dark side just captures my eye
I know that you're a villain but I can't stop this feeling

No Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)

Why do all good girls like the bad boys?
I know that you're a villain but I can't stop this feeling, no

You're cocky and its working
Chauvinistic and its perfect
M-m-must be something wrong with me
I-I-I use to think that I was strong
But I now I see how I was wrong
Because you took control of me

You get under my skin, such a sweet sin
Just like a disease that keeps on, keeps on eating at me
I know good and well you're good for nothing
They say you don't deserve me
But it really don't disturb me

Why do all good girls like the bad boys?
Like a moth to a flame, I guess I'm back here again
Tell me why the dark side just captures my eye
I know that you're a villain but I can't stop this feeling

No Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)

Flo-Rida:
She can't stop this feeling no, I tell her go with the flow righttt
Say little mama want to know why the good girls like the bad boys
Bad meaning good, shawty left with no choice
So over your skin, baby phat you're so moist
Leaving with the tins, when I'm macking invoice
My laptop bling and a boy can't avoid
She love it going in, she don't want to be unemployed
One reason to be a good pleasin'
Freaking daddy's little girl like I'm halfway decent
Sure it ain't a lesson that I maybe been teaching
Party all night and keep preaching

Why do all good girls like the bad boys?
Like a moth to a flame, guess I'm back here again
