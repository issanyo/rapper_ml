[Verse 1: Nickelback]
Wake up
My baby still looks amazing with no makeup
And dammit I knew the second that you came up
From underneath the covers
Said "I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother"
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country
And now we're buying diamonds
Saying it's only 20 karats, it can't be that hard to find it, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Nickelback]
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round

[Chorus: Nickelback]
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round

[Verse 2: Nickelback]
Out on sunset
I can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet
As soon as I looked over
There's no way to sugarcoat it
You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde, girl
Keep up with what you doing
Ain't nothing wrong girl
Looks like we got another come along, girl
If you ain't afraid to try it
You know we'll be flying private as long as I can be the pilot, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Nickelback]
Your touch has made me a believer
Your love is all I ever needed
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round

[Chorus]
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round

[Bridge]
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and)
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and)
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and)
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and)
(Runnin' and runnin' and runnin' and)

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Flo Rida, girl you got me runnin' round
What a perfect misses
My misses still eat McDonald's, taste delicious
Primadonna, not this one, so I guess she'll get it
Work my kisses
Work my britches
Every nickel back pays a visit
To my baby girl, my baby, yeah
Run around town on a treadmill
I ain't going nowhere
No underwear, that's what she wears
Thought a Playmate wanna join the party
She responds to me like, "Hugh Heff?"
Birthday cake, wanna grant my wishes
Every day I'm losing my breath
Can't replace that face, that waist
I'd chase this girl like Belvidere
Baby

[Chorus]
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round
She takes like the sunshine kissing me
Even sweeter than the honey on a bumblebee
And she said, "Honey, if you want to you can come with me"
She's got me runnin' 'round and 'round

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She's got me runnin' round and round
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
She's got me runnin' round and round
