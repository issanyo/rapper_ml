Hey, Ms. Red Carpet

She can autograph my pockets

Anytime, anyplace, anyway

I'll be looking at everybody else watch it

I don't wanna be obnoxious

But this girl's worth the gossip

Take away the smile

The tattoos now, forever she very guard less

I imagine her topless

She might set off my rocket

On and poppin'

She met Mark and then

Attitude like we arguing

With her by my side I point glitter to my life

I should twitter this girl, she's sparkling

She ain't no rock star

But she's got groupies

She ain't no actress

But she makes movies

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches

But she's got fashion

She ain't a model

But camera's flashing

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

Hey, they wanna know my mama's name

'Cause that where she get from

They ain't never shot her with silicon

Shawty is her and her she¡¦s the real one

Touch one, grab one, feel one

I wish she woulda told me that

Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back

Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass

She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags

Like damn, can I be yo police badge?

Pull it up, get a little cozy and

Woman is sorta like and oldie jam

Record some on a playboy cam

She ain't no actress

The movie found my mattress

Rock star, none of that practice

But she's got fanatics

She ain't no rock star

But she's got groupies

She ain't no actress

But she makes movies

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches

But she's got fashion

She ain't a model

But camera's flashing

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

Ooh, ohh, ohh

Look at her, go, I wanna know

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

Ooh, ohh, ohh

Look at her, go, I wanna know ooh ooh

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't no rock star

But she's got groupies

She ain't no actress

But she makes movies

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches

But she's got fashion

She ain't a model

But camera's flashing

And when she struts that thing around

Everybody be breaking their neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?
