[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
Three, two

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Yeah, like a charm, baby
Brighter than this thing on my arm, baby
It's a party every time you come around, baby
Now if you're down, baby
I can be the ground, baby, here me running
Ain't nothing looking better than when I see you coming
Ain't none other feeling better than when I'm blowing money
You can tell that I'm an addict, I'm addicted to money
I'm addicted to ballin'

[Pre-Chorus 1: Flo Rida]
I got the sip of Patron, I bought a ticket to Rome
And by the end of the evening, forget a weekend
We won't even know what planet we on
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Ordering triple, seeing double, I'm acting single
You on the top, I'm the bottom and she the middle
I did all for the nookie, Oreo cookie
Bout to kill it, shawty, don't push me
Now drop it, you got it
Thank God it's Friday
We love that TGIF, word, yeah
Let's get it popping, baby
Show me something, baby
Or I can blow it on the next girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: Flo Rida]
I got the 151, you got a way with your tongue
And by the end of the evening, forget a weekend
We won't even know what planet we on
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time

[Bridge: Jason Derulo & Flo Rida]
Saturday, I'm hitting all the beaches
And I ain't talking playing in the sun (no)
Sunday, I'm praying for forgiveness
But the week just begun, hun
Cause Monday, so many, goddamn it
Tuesday, she wanna go up
But Wednesday, I panic, come scrambling
Thursday just ain't my luck

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
You just save me when my life came tumbling down
And I know you're gonna leave me
(You gonna leave me)
Hello, Friday, I've been waiting for you for a long time
(Long time)
