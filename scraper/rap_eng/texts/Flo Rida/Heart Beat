[Intro]
Tell me that you're gonna stay
Don't let this heart fade away
Don't let this heart fade away
You are my heart beat

[Spoken]
(((STRONGARM)))

[Verse 1]
Why did I have to be wrong
Because I thought that you
Would simply just call back
You got me singing this song
Tryna' reach out to you
And hope that you would come back

[Pre-Hook]
One day I'm crying
Today I'm laughing
What's with these emotions
They got me sinking under
My faith is running low
And I swear I'm 'bout to lose control
I need my heart beat, It's you

[Hook x2]
My heart beats, for you
Every second of the day, for you
You don't even know how I'm feeling
But this love will never fail
Please believe it!

[Verse 2]
I've wasted all of my time
With someone who I thought
I could really depend on
Who knew that I was so blind
And now I'm paying the price
Tryna' keep this beat beating
You had the time of your life
Playing games with mine
Knowing how I felt about you
See now I'm paying the price
Cause you're the beat to my heart
And nothing that you do can change that

[Pre-Hook]
One day I'm crying
Today I'm laughing
What's with these emotions
They got me sinking under
My faith is running low
And I swear I'm 'bout to lose control
I need my heart beat, It's you

[Hook x2]
My heart beats, for you
Every second of the day, for you
You don't even know how I'm feeling
But this love will never fail
Please believe it!

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're gonna stay
Don't let this heart fade away
Cause I've been seeing shades of grey
You are my heart beat
Tell me that you're gonna stay
Cause I need my heart beat

[Hook x2]
My heart beats, for you
Every second of the day, for you
You don't even know how I'm feeling
But this love will never fail
Please believe it!
