Cuz we came here to

(x2)

Girl, ,my name Kingston
Really Nice to meet ya
We can take the lambo
Or the new beamer

Plus she likes the weather
Where it's warm and sandy

Now that 'cha here girl

So I just wanna let ya know

Girl nobody deserves your spot
Even with the hips and the curves you got

Lookin' at the way that you work
You got any man would be lucky to have you

And you say no
What you expect with
A body so cold?

Please tell me what you

Say you gotta man, But

(x2)

Ooh Shawyty is nada

Your mind gonna race
In a million miles

And that's what I'm meanin' Now
Pone-ey i'll be somethin'

Money is no dilemma
Pushin' I'm just like dinner

Forget him you won't remember
