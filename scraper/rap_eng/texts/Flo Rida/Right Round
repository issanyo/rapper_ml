[Treblemakers]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[My Name Is Kay]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

[Donald]
Walk out that house with my swagger
Hop in there with dough, I got places to go!
People to see, time is precious
I looked at my cotty, are ya out of control?
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shawties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on, whoa

[Jesse]
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies, it's on
Then pop in the next 'cause this mix'll be ours
We keep a fade-away shot
'Cause we ballin' it's Platinum Patron that be ours
Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you the drink with all that goodie powers

[Treblemakers]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[My Name Is Kay]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down

Shawty must know I'm the man
My money love her like her number one fan
Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my Bens
My Benjamin Frank-el-ens
A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin' her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We buildin' castles that's made out of sand

[Jesse]
She's amazin', her fire blazin'

Hotter than Cajun, girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belong on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is wavin' at me
Like, "Damn it, I told you"
You wanna shoot like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and I'll be your chauffeur

[Treblemakers]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
[My Name Is Kay]
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down
From the top of the pole, I watch her go down
She got me throwin' my money around
Ain't nothin' more beautiful to be found
It's goin' down, down

I'm spendin' my money, I'm out of control
Somebody help me, she's takin' my bank roll
But I'm king in the club, and I'm wearin' the crown
Poppin' these bottles, touchin' these models
Watchin' they asses go down, down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down
You spin my head right round, right round
When you go down, when you go down down

Hey!
