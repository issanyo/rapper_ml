[Intro - Flo Rida]
Hey Flo Rida
Frankie, Mollie
Una, Vanessa, Rochelle
What you doing Saturday girl?

[Verse 1 - Vanessa)
I'm doing nothing
'Cause then at least I'm doing nothing wrong
And I'm gonna stay in on my own
And turn off my telephone
If nothing's gained, then nothing's won

[Verse 2 - Una)
And you can tell 'em
Yeah you can say whatever, I don't care, yeah
And if you wanna play it cool
Then I got news for you
It's getting hotter, hotter in here

[Chorus - The Saturdays]
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words

[Verse 3 - Frankie]
I'm getting closer
I'm moving in and yeah I think you know
'Cause I am sick of playing games
And I'm not gonna say no names
Both you and I know who to blame

[Verse 4 - Rochelle]
So you can tell 'em
Yeah you can go ahead and put it straight
'Cause I am finishing myself
And I do not need your help
I'm gonna do this, do it right

[Chorus - The Saturdays]
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words

[Rap - Flo Rida]
She said I'm messing up the words
But this ain't what I heard
I get it first hand
Tryn'a push me to the curb
Just what I deserve
I get on the nerves
Damn she got curves
All over this hers
I talk, she talk
But then it's my fault
When I'm leaving she be tripping
I did nothing at all
Put me on the mission
Tryna listen to the broad
Sayin' I got a feeling like she's speaking to the wall
No understanding, shawty demanding
Y'all can spin a rack
Got my head in her bandage
Girl follow your mouth
I'll be taking the bandage
Say yes, I got my crown
But then I hear

[Chorus - The Saturdays]
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
So when I speak, listen, 'cause you keep on pushing
Like I need permission to be heard
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
I'm gonna lift it, lift it higher
So when I speak, listen, this is my decision
And you keep on messing up the words
