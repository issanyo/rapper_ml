[Verse 1]
Baby girl, used ride on the metro
Had a dream of diamonds and stilettos
First class in Miami from the West Coast
Never wanted to be homecoming queen
Not just another girl in the strip club
Working hard, not a dollar's gonna miss her
Big, big bags, I'm gonna tip her
Making sure she's gonna come home with me

[Pre-Chorus]
One money, two honey
How much can I throw?
And for her I can't say no
I won't let go

[Chorus]
I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a

[Verse 2]
It's 3AM and we're only getting started
In the cab on the way to your apartment
Tonight you made the killing cause you're gorgeous
Yeah, we're gonna have a hell of a time
Blew hunneds everywhere like a cartoon
Ooh baby, I can't take my eyes off you
Give it to me like yo mamma never taught you
I'll make it rain for the rest of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
One money, two honey
How much can I throw?
And for her I can't say no
Oh, I won't let go

[Chorus]
I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a...

[Bridge]
Nothing gets me going like when she put on a show
Ain't ashamed to say it, I'll let everybody know
You don't have to say no words, you let your body speak
Baby I don't care, no I don't care

[Chorus]
I fell in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
Throwing all this cake, ooh
It's your birthday girl, I like that there
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a dancer, dancer
In the champagne room until the sun comes up, oh my god
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with a...
