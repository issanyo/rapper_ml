[Verse 3: Tyga]
Damn your size, little waist don't match your thighs
Say you're on my level but my level too high
Looking in your eyes, don't look so surprised
I know you ain't heard that, before
Searching in the club and I just found one
Pick up lines, I just dropped mine
Single for the night, tryna double my funds
So whats up, to the bad bitch
In the corner, with her ass big
And her hair long, I'mma grab it
She call me daddy, but I'm a bastard
Like, I ain't tryna be horse & carriage
Or tryna take care of you, so put your bad habit
I just wanna smash it, smash it
Pass it, show you where the cash is, cash is
But first lemme see you...
