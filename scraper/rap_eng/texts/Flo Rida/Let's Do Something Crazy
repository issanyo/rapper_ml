[Verse 1:]
I would never let a tear fall from your eyes, no, no no
Cause everything you are to me, ohh I could never let you hurt inside
You mean so much, and I'm so thankful that you're in my life
And I appreciate your love and all your sacrifice
Without you by my side, I never could survive
I wouldn't be the woman standin' here before your eyes

[Pre-Chorus:]
You taught me strength and you gave me guidance
Whenever faith was lost, you were there to find it
And all because a mother's love is unconditional
With all my heart and all my soul, I wanna let you know

[Chorus:]
That I thank you, and I love you
And I would never place anyone above you
Said I thank you, and I love you
And I will never ever place no one above you
You have given me life, and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today
I will never let go to everything that we share
And nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, here's what I'm sayin'

[Verse 2:]
See, I've been blessed to be raised by a woman so strong
Cause even when I did things wrong
You would show me just the way that I should carry on
You kept me safe, and you protected me with all you had
And any time I was in need you gave your very last
Without you by my side, I never could survive
I wouldn't be the woman standing here before your eyes

[Pre-Chorus:]
Ju taught me strength and, ju gave me guidance
Whenever faith was lost, ju were there to find it
And all because a mother's love is unconditional
With all my heart, and all my soul, I wanna let you know

[Chorus:]
That I thank you, and I love you
And I would never place anyone above you
Said I thank you, and I love you
And I will never ever place no one above you
You have given me life, and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today
I will never let go to everything that we share
And nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, here's what I'm sayin'

[Bridge:]
I remember wakin' up early monday morning
With my new dress, and my new shoes, with the buckles on em
And you would kiss my face, and say "I love you babe"
And you would be right there to take all of my fear away
And when he broke my heart, you said it was hist lost
And not to think about, "you're better off without him"
Remember when they said that I was never gonna make it
You said "it's yours, and all you gotta do is go and take it"

[Chorus:]
I thank you, and I love you
And I would never place any above you
Said I thank you, and I love you
And I will never ever place no one above you
See, you have given me life, and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today
I will never let go to everything that we share
And nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you, here's what I'm sayin'
I thank you, and I love you
And I would never ever place anyone above you
Said I thank you, and I love you
And I will never ever place no one above you
See, you have given me life, and I just want you to know
That you're the reason I'm here today
I will never let go to everything that we share
And nothing can compare
I thank you, I thank you, I thank you
Here's what I'm sayin' yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
