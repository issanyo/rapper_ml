(Pre-Chorus: J. Rand & T-Pain)
You gotta move it move it (move it) shake it (shake it)
All over the back
When she do it, she do it
Derek Cardigans on her face
Come on girl, we got somewhere to be
Now tell your homegirl that you’re leaving with me

(Chorus: J. Rand & T-Pain)
And we gon ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon ride, ride
Ride, ride
We gon ride

(Verse 1: J. Rand)
3 in the morning, we’re so twisted
Body talkin that shit girl
You know I’m listening
Heh my heart’s racing
Gotta catch my breath girl
I’m tryna tell you that I really need your lovin, come on
I’mma take you to my spot spot
We’re first to call the shots

(Pre-Chorus)

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: J. Rand)
Where’s your heart now?
Don’t need nobody
Cuz I’m hooked on you
Girl on that body
Hey baby what are you thinkin cuz I’m just ready to go?
I know you came with your friends
Well we should just leave the floor
I’mma take you to my spot spot
We’re first to call the shots

(Pre-Chorus)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Flo Rida)
Hey you fuck, you suck, got my worst theme
I know you ready for this championship ring
That’s why I need a little, they can show the army
Feelin dirty, I’m tryna see yo knees clean
Yep, I know your kind
You’ll fake it, never must see 69
Tryna get ahead so I been on my grind
About 3 legs so I won’t waste yo time
Walk up in the spot, don’t test me
Oh she so sexy
Kiss from the side, enough to impress me
Big me strong, got the ball, come fetch me
Beat it out the park, be gangsta Joe Pesci
Like Hollywood then she will break a peggy
We all aim down and I’m fresh shit

(Pre-Chorus)

(Bridge: T-Pain)
Ride, ride ride
Ride, ride ride
Ride, ride ride
Ride, ride ride
We gon ride, ride
Ride, ride
And we gon ride

(Bridge)
