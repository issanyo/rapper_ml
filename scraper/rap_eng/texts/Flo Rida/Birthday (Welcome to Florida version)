[Intro]
Flo Rida got a story to tell (a story to tell, a story to tell)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
There once was a man that lived in a shoe
Next to a bakery that I knew
His excuse? He had a sweet tooth
Ever since the days of his youth
I love cake, he said, me too
Tastes so good, I drive in the coupe
(E'eryday) trapped and come through
(E'eryday) catching that loot
For some strange reason, his shop never closed
And everybody leaving had powder on their nose
Dunkin' lines, Betty Crocker, bankrolls

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We eating everyday (Rick), go check my resume (Ross)
I'm doing Mary Jane, off in this seven tre
Yeah, I got twenty whips, close to forty women
So I get plenty lips, I love swimming
I'm shining everyday, you shining once a year
Multi-millionaire, I had a monster year
We on monster trucks, so yeah we crushing haters
Never squashing beef, got too much paper
You don't know, you better look around
Poe Boy, the biggest crooks in towns
Little niggas like "put me down"
50 grand just to book me now
Rolling up on the good, we now
Who you hoes calling pugwee now?
Baddest chicks wanna fuck me now
They screaming loud, like it's a touchdown

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
I don't want cake on the day I was born
I want my cake like I waked up and yawned
Flo Rida built like a Catholic with yarn
Look up my stacks ?
Rubber bands on a hundred grand
I'm in love with that cake from thuggin' man
I'm in the trap where they baking in the oven, man
Crystal, rose, keep bubbling
If you ain't talking about your birthday
You probably ain't had cake in the first place
I go hard until the block hit first day
I do my part for Poe Boy, my birthplace
I stood on the block on the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
I'm still in the hood, ain't got away
Carol City, all good, MIA
I'm on my grind, I gotta have my Dunkin' Lines
Betty Crocker on my mind, everyday, 3-65
Flo Rida own a bakery line, look at them drones chasing me now
I get known for basically rhymes
Do what I want, I got dolla' signs

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)

[Verse 4: Torch]
Happy birthday, baby, what's your birthplace?
Where your birthmark? What's your zodiac and birthday?
I'm gettin' money, that's the only cake I ever knew
Fifty thousand the closest thing to candles I ever blew
I close my eyes, made a wish and it came true
Now I'm rocking clubs, arena and all the bigger venues
Everyday we balling, tipping the phantom pricin'
Hit the club, I come out wearing all the icin'
I know the wrist enticing, why the Bentley brightest
Some like a bitch sound lightning
Chris came hard and I can do it again
See Flo Rida like my brother, he my twin

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
Coming through your hood in a seven tre, gettin' cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)
I told y'all: I don't want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake E'eryday, e'eryday
I can spend hundred thousand in a day making cake
E'eryday (e'eryday), e'eryday (e'eryday)

[Outro]
