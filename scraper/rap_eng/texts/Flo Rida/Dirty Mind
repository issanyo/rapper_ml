[Intro: Flo Rida & Sam Martin]
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Gotta be starting something
Don't you feel it tonight that you wanna be free?
No, you don't mind
'Cause what's mine is yours and yours is mine
I don't mind we on this to keep
Turn down for what? I'm not taking a breather
Can't help myself, I'm surrounded by divas
I can just tell how you look at me, stare at me, watching me watching you think like a freak
Hotel, Motel
I don't kiss and tell
Gene Simmons
She can't hide that tongue in mascara
You like it, I love it
That kinky, that yell
I know I'm in trouble, but I clean up well

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Road rage, gold cage
Drink up, this gon' be a long day
I done got up in your mind
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya now

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Sam Martin]
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Mmm, my skin diamond loosey
T-tie me up, shine me up, give me that bubblegum flavor
Caramel lolli-pop it for papi and drop it for papi, but papi won't save her
You're hot as a, hot as a
Hot as a sunburn in Africa
Me on Stephanie, you on Erica
Two on two, baby, we need the camera

[Pre-Chorus: Flo Rida]
Road rage, gold cage
Drink up, this gon' be a long day
I done got up in your mind
Let me tell ya, let me tell ya now

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Sam Martin]
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?

[Bridge: Flo Rida & Sam Martin]
Oops
Oops, I
Oops, I got
Oops, I got up in...

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Sam Martin]
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
(Oh my)
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
Oops, I got up inside of your dirty, dirty mind
Don't ya love it?
Don't ya love it, yeah?
