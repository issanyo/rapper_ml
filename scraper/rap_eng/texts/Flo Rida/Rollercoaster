[Intro: Flo Rida]
Stop what you're doing, let's toast
Mista magic mountain, now she wanna overdose
Flo Rida do the most, that's a statement under oath
This train on fast approach to pick up Natalie La Rose
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Natalie La Rose]
Bought a ticket for the ride
But I can't turn back now, I'm inside
Oh 'round and around it goes
Where it stops, nobody knows
I'm addicted to the climb
You can hear my heart beat double time
Make me blush, give me vertigo
Can't stop, I already know

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose]
Oh, you lift me up, make me spin around
Yeah, you hit the breaks and then bring me down
I touch the cloud and fall back to the ground

[Chorus: Natalie La Rose]
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
Oh, oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
Oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
I don't know, I don't know why
Your roller coaster ride

[Verse 2: Natalie La Rose]
I'm a victim of desire
Cause your body sets my heart on fire
Yeah, you know how to move it right
Back and forth, take me through the night
I'mma stay here by your side
Wanna keep my hands inside your ride
Gonna make it to paradise
All the way take me through the night

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie La Rose]
Oh, you lift me up, make me spin around
Yeah, you hit the breaks and then bring me down
I touch the cloud and fall back to the ground

[Chorus: Natalie La Rose]
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
Oh, oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
Oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh,  oh-oh
I don't know, I don't know why
Your roller coaster ride

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
All access to my up and down, up and down
Flo Rida express got you addicted now, spinnin' 'round
Roller coaster crazy girl, said you wanna go faster
Fast and furious when I take them curves, another chapter
Hold up, get ready for the climb
The way you sell your sexy, while I let you skip the line
So we can share this theme park, your body any time
The perfect place to scream cause you know it's going down

[Bridge: Natalie La Rose]
(I'll ride your roller coaster)
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
When I'm with you I ain't never gonna hit the ground
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
Roller coaster
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
When I'm with you I ain't never gonna hit the ground
You pick me up, take me anywhere and spin me 'round
Roller coaster

[Outro: Natalie La Rose]
I don't know, I don't know why
But I love to ride your roller coaster
