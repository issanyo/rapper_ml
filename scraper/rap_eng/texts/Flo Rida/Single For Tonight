Yeah, you already know I'm on my round
You a single lady and nobody told me

Shawty, quit playing
You ain't got a boyfriend but some million dollar chance
I know I sound polite, you're all for it tonight
Let's get in here, do a ten, upgrade your life
Look back in the past 'cause he ain't ever been this fellow
Pop the champagne show me how to get me something
When you pour down
You still looking right at me
Get your score now
So let me holla at you baby
Turn the score around
The game changer
I wanna bang you but you a banger, a disclaimer
So you know I ain't telling, I don't get credit
There's cash every time, I'm growing sick of them being jealous
Relax, he get mad at you
I still got plenty, but drop that papi chulo, mama
You ain't gotta stress

Pull to the club, walking in then I
Pull up to the bar, get drinks then I
Pull up to a broad, let her know what it is
How it is, why it is, what it is
I ain't got time for no games and neither do you
You single tonight and you leaving at 2
Back of my mind like what she gonna do
When she backed up right on me and stepped in the booth
Now we pouring some drinks and she bringing her friends
Do they all wanna roll but it really depends
Are they single tonight or they cooked up with men
'Cause we did it last night and won't do it again
So they hop in the Benz with their friends on the road
There's only one thing about me you should know
I'm white boy wasted, party in my basement
Find me in the club, Suss One, on the same shit
[DJ Suss One]
That's right ladies, you know what it is
If you're single for tonight report to the dance floor right now
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, let's go
If you're single hands up, hands up, hands up
If you're single hands up, hands up, hands up
If you're single hands up, hands up, hands up
If you're single hands up
Now put your motherfucking hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Now put your motherfucking hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Now put your motherfucking hands up
Don't see no boyfriend
