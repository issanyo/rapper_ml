[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...
My whole squad iced out
My niggas so trill, my niggas so trill
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...

[Verse 1]
Why ask a question that already got an answer?
End of discussion, meet the polar bears you pandas
Rubberband bananza
When I'm in the land of
20 grand a [stander?]
Make you understand us
I'm sorry if you ain't got ya stacks up
Tell yo click to patch up
That envy get you patched up
Dog, y'ain't ready for this
Machine thang ready to spit
I ain't just tellin' you shit
Peat game look at my wrist
Flo Rida franchise, I'm like the pizza man
All about cheese, full of dough
Let me [grease?] ya hands
[Mobile?] I ain't local
Ghetto nigga, done wit postal
Stuntin' hard, that's my focal
Now my cash goin' coastal

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...
My whole squad iced out
My niggas so trill, my niggas so trill
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...

[Verse 2]
The world don't revolve around me
That's what the haters say 'til that revolve around me
Fort Knox, I'm in the spot
Big knocks, right off the block
Closed shop, come in that drop
Hoes flock, givin' me props
I used to be gross, 'til that income grossed
Me enough to toast, like I'm on the sitcoms
Champagne overdose
East Coast, West Coast
Came in the game, wit a remote
Turn on my fame, I got to glow
A project dude? The new dollar signs
All this from on the grind
All this from writing rhymes
Silver shoe boxes, big faces on my watches
Seven figures that's the object
No more [carrying a?] sausage

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...
My whole squad iced out
My niggas so trill, my niggas so trill
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...

[Verse 3]
Flo Rida so abusive to them Ben Franks
Rubber bands flyin' like the pilot had too many dranks
Turbulence, she makin' it bounce
I got the best seat in the house
Twerking it, I'm losing count
She workin' for that dollar 'mount
A privilege just to be a prospector, ballin
Mo' issues a pistol fallin'
Official, the shot callin'
Holdin' it down, settin' it off
Money to floss, bitch I'm a boss
Takin a loss, no matter the cost
Women to toss, I live in a [loft?]
Carol City, doing big thangs, baby
Them Dade County streets raised me
Ever since the early 80's
APT's, live in the hood
Triple beams, slangin' that good
Krispy Kreme, where I stood
Livin' the dream, just like I should

[Chorus]
Ain't no need to ask why
I let them rubber bands fly
I let them rubber bands fly
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...
My whole squad iced out
My niggas so trill, my niggas so trill
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Ack like you know, ack, ack like you know
Hey...
