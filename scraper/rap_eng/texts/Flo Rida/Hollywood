[Intro: Nicole Scherzinger]
It feels so good to feel Hollywood
Hollywood hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
You gon' find my star on the walk of fame
Everywhere I go, everybody knows my name
I step into the club everybody, people show me love
They know if they don't make money, just don't make change
See that house on top of the hill
That's where me and my baby live
With the check, Ferrari, black maserati

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
It feels so good to feel hollywood
Hollywood hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood
Find me on the strip, here's a tip
Keep the change, babe
Get you something pretty from the shop
Back in hollywood
Hollywood hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
If you just got your check, I know you feel good
Take it to the bank, and you can drop it like you should
Go and get your nails done get yourself a bath
Go and get your hair did, you deserve that
I'm an independent woman on top of the world
All up in the spot like me and my girls
They are feelin' ooh so fabulous
To feel fresh, feel famous
Can you handle this?

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
It feels so good to feel hollywood
Hollywood hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood
Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood
Find me on the strip, here's a tip
Keep the change, babe
Get you something pretty from the shop
Back in hollywood

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, shawty would you mind, cause I want me some
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one
Yup, yup! Your vision, so, so delicious
Can't help my interest, candy addiction
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece
I don't know a piece, give me all your sweets
Bottom and top lip, 'bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast
Man for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me
I'll gladly let you know I wanna kiss
But your lips, they'll do me fine
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind
Get, get on the grip, girl you ain't lyin'

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
It feels so good to feel hollywood

Holly-holly-holly-holly-hollywood

Find me on the strip, here's a tip
Keep the change, babe
Get you something pretty from the shop
Back in hollywood
