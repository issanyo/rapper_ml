[Intro]
But it hurts to think you're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But i wonder do you think of me?
Do you think of me? Cause I'm thinking of

[Bridge]
All i wanted was to keep this love alive (yeah)
And all i wanted was to be there by your side
(yeah yeah)
I know better than to keep on telling lies
Should have swallowed my pride
But i think sometimes that

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But i wonder
Do you think of me
Do you think of me
Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go

[Verse 1]
I think its best that we let it go
No stress than the mess we was headed for
Cause only trouble had vision in the telescope
A peace of mind better than mission impossible
Who want a possible
I take a bird in the hand if its toucan
But two can't play the star in a new band
Rockin wit you get it poppin wit you
When da gossip hit you I dont wanna say I shoulda coulda woulda would
Any nigga in his right mind wanna keep a grudge
Deadly flow kid you ain't never seen a dove
Dancing over trouble what its papas daughter
Rolling stones she can't hide in a Louis clutch
The bigger man when I look back at it pretty much
Another chance at it pass on it like a bud
Just hit the gas on it man shortly to the club
I think its best it was best that we split up

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But i wonder
Do you think of me
Do you think of me
Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go

[Verse 2]
And, all I ever wanted was a good girl
Good girls come within I got a tell a little girl
Shawty lil mama lets try to save the drama
I know I ain't a saint but still believe in karma
I'm gon' try to get my shit together
Oh yeah I know its misery
So what the hell I tell her
Hello good morning
I was out with my homie for his birthday
But that excuse had neva had me comin home late
You straight I'm straight I don't want to deal with it
Yeah she told me that a couple times ima live with it
No yo let me know I might come visit
Thats when you know you got the rope around your neck
Pitchin, scratching, choking whatever
Hangin from the tree the next time I know better
Face tattooed on me should of got letters
Dead to her face if I could Ill tell her

[Chorus]
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
But it hurts to think
You're somewhere on a search for me
I'm right here with no words to speak
Daydreaming about what could never be
It will never be
But i wonder
Do you think of me
Do you think of me
Cause I'm thinking of you
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
Maybe it was best it was best that we let it go
