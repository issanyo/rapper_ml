Sugar

Flo Rida
Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier
I’m a fan all day
Do me that favor, cuz I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch, Shawty that's what's up

(Chorus)
Flo Rida
Hey, Sh Shawty would you mind, cuz I want me some
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one
Yep yep, you're vicious, so so delicious
Can't help my interest, candy addiction
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece
I don't know a piece, Give me all your sweets
Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I’m a lip bitin' beast
Smile for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama syrup, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me
I'll gladly let you know I wanna kiss
But your lips, they'll do me fine
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind
Get, get on the grip, Girl you ain't lyin'

(Chorus)
Flo Rida
You like my sugar, my sugar
You so sweet, so sweet
Like my candy, my candy
You so sweet, so sweet
I got a good appetite with you on me, on me
I'll wrap you out of them clothes
You my treat, my treat
Girl you my sugar, I call you Candy
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some
Girl you my sugar, I call you Candy
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some sugar

(Chorus)
