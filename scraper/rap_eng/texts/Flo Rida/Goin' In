[Verse 3]
Hey you hands on the ceiling
Nobody move, nobody get shot
Lip pounds on me
I love it how a mami went around on me
So I never get enough of yelling, ven aqui
Officer on duty, j.lo what they call her
Take me to jail, cause I wanna be your robber
Put me in a cell if you really need to holler
Put me in a cell feed down flo rida, hey
To the sky, put your hands on rock
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa
So they want to freak, on the way you call papa
Got to make them sing high notes like oprah
When the ego, I got four leo
Even the DJ, want to rep puerto rico
Got it on replay, like you just broke a needle
Whatever that he say, better listen up people

[Outro]
Tonight, feels like, Tonight, feels like, the best night of my life
I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, I'm going in, hey!
