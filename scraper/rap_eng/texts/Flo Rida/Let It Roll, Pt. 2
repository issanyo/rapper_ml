[Intro]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin’ why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
It’s like Woodstock city, brand new feelin’
Bob to the music, suck than I visit
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrick
Walk through a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a blizzard
2 million in the frame, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all they wanna know
When the party gon’ start, let the good times roll
Come on let’s go, you got a lot of living
Get the party on the road, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one road
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain’t ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like you know, just what to do
When the good times roll

[Hook]
Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me trippin’ why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

[Lil Wayne: Verse 2]
Hey, Flo I got you!
Yeah yeah!
Take your, take your clothes off
Ride that bitch I drove off
Highway to heaven I’ll burn the bridge
Red bandana, blood, sweat and tears
Yeah, it’s Tunechi, bitch
With a capital crucifix, hahaha!
Let the good times roll like my weed
Tricks on my skateboard, and up my sleves
YMCMB Truk everything else
So many whips, my garage got whelps
Now put your motherfuckin’ hands in the air
And my throne is an electric chair
Yeah!

[Bridge:Flo-rida]
And let’s go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let’s go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast to the good times
May they last forever, we’re young, to the good times
Raise your glass, let’s all have some fun
Come on baby, let the good times roll (x5)

Come on baby, come on let the good times roll!
