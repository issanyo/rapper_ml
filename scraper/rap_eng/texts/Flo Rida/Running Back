These days, you barely even say my name
Like you don't really feel the same
I'm wondering what's to blame

These nights, I fall asleep wondering where you are
It feels like we're falling apart
And it's only breaking my heart

Cause if being with you means being alone
And never knowing when you're coming home
Then I guess I'm better off on my own

[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that means forgetting, forgetting everything we had
Instead I keep running, keep running, I keep running back
Cause I keep forgetting, forgetting you treat me so bad
So I keep on coming, keep coming, I keep coming back
I keep coming back
I keep running back (x 2)
I keep coming back
I keep running back (x 2)
I keep coming, I keep coming back

[Part 2]
My friends say, that I should leave you behind
And stop wasting all of my time
They tell me that I'm outta my mind

But I know that what we both share is real
And I've been willing to deal
With the way that you're making me feel

Cause if being with you means being alone
And never knowing when you're coming home
Then I guess I'm better off on my own

[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that means me forgetting, forgetting everything we had
Instead I keep running, keep running, I keep running back
Cause I keep forgetting, forgetting you treat me so bad
So I keep on coming, keep coming, I keep coming back
I keep coming back
I keep running back (x 2)
I keep coming back
I keep running back (x 2)
I keep coming, I keep coming back

[Rap]
Ma-ma-ma-mama caught up
We done all heard the same story
Just different authors
This book crazy

Always a lady
Looking for love where there's a maybe
They might could be together
They fight to be together
A'ight to be together

Shorty, yeah he cheated
You say you don't need it
Turn around and leave it
Oh, he back next week

Fuss... Fight
And then the whole thing repeat like nothing ever happened
Dat was just rapping
No publishing
Shorty you knew that he don't got the same government

Lil mama can't move on
But it's her fault she struggling
She can't... move... on

[Chorus]
But I can't move on
Cause that means forgetting, forgetting everything we had
Instead I keep running, keep running, I keep coming back
I keep coming back
Keep running back
And I keep coming back
I keep running back
I keep coming back
I keep running back
I keep running, keep running back
I can keep coming back
I can keep coming back
I can keep running back
I can keep coming back
I can keep running back...
To you
