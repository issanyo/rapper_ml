Just like the light show
Just like the light show (show)
Just like the light show

Better lock and load
Cause I'm ready up glow
Like the laser light show
Oh oh oh
Watch me go 'bout to lose control
By the laser light, laser light, laser light show

I gotta know you're from out of space
You gotta glow
You live without a trace
You take the party, pa-party back
Party, pa-party back

Put the hands in the air and the party go
Bring the party back

Like the roll glowing
She rocks and she rolled, rolled
Baby don't stop what you're doing
Just got into your glowing

I go oh
You take off later
Show oh just like the light show

Better lock and load
Cause I'm ready up glow
Like the laser light show
Oh oh oh
Watch me go 'bout to lose control
By the laser light, laser light, laser light show

Laser light, laser light, laser light show

Laser light show
Oh oh oh
Laser light, laser light, laser light show
Laser light show
Oh oh oh

Like the roll glowing
She rocks and she rolled, rolled
Don't stop what you're doing, doing
Doing, doing
Just got into your glowing
Glowing, glowing

Like the roll glowing
She rocks and she rolled, rolled
Don't stop what you're doing, doing
Doing, doing
Just got into your glowing
Glowing, glowing

Just like the light show

Better lock and load
Cause I'm ready up glow
Like the laser light show
Oh oh oh
Watch me go 'bout to lose control
By the laser light, laser light, laser light show

Laser light, laser light, laser light show
Laser light show
Oh oh oh

Laser light, laser light, laser light show
Laser light show
Oh oh oh
