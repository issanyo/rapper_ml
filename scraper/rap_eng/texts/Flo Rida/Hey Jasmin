Yeah Flo Rida
I run the globe with this one
Yeah I run the world with this one

Shake what your mama gave body technology
Girl I love the way you flashin' hey Jasmin
Shake what your mama gave body technology
Girl I love the way you flashin' hey Jasmin

Keep watching you running the floor
How you work us out of control
Girl like your lip do that freaking it
You make it look just like you are roll
Oh, how you work it child
Turn around and bumps ups and down
Girl your body is so versatile hey Jasmin
I gotta see you right now

Turn it up girl you jump down the party
Drop it low on the floor rock your body
In this club girl what's up let's get naughty
Back it up move this low push it on me

Turn it up girl you jump down the party
Drop it low on the floor rock your body
In this club girl what's up let's get naughty
Back it up move this low push it on me

Hey girl I see you one line show me up sign
You're a wild one that's what I like
You can be screaming and I may be beat it
But we still gon be on like Jasmin dot com
