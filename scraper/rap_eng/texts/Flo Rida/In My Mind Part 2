[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
I've waited for this life
Waited for this time
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup
One night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Perfect brother, can't tell you that I'm at but I'm on the right track
Every time I look back, it's a struggle
No faith I woulda' sat right there, forgot about my friends
Cause I done hustled, no not dope just soap in vanilla envelopes
Check out my demo, oh I'm flo right now, when I go right now
Was it ever that simple, used to roll, get pumped like a Pitbull
Out the way said I ain't got potential, cake walk guess I ain't get the memo
Ooh take a walk in my shoes, 'cause tonight my dreams they came true
And I'ma party it up through the roof (This is what we're waiting for)

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for

[Post-Chorus: Flo Rida]
I've waited for this life
Waited for this time
Waited for this moment to step into the light
Got this drink up in my cup, one night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we've had enough

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Party people
I've got the wind at my head, my mind says yes when my body says when I equal
No it's not an option, I'ma yes I can 'til this spaceship land with the Beatles
See the road blocks up and my autograph sucks but the leech is unbelievable
Got the round, but the bucks not wanna get bucked
But, my fist up, rock star sign
Guitars just broke, in my mind
Was packing up, I might get by
Talking bout luck, on my side oh
Take a walk in my shoes
'Cause in like my dreams they came true
And I'm a party it up through the roof ooh (This is what we're waiting for)

[Chorus: Georgi Kay]
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
And in my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we're waiting for
