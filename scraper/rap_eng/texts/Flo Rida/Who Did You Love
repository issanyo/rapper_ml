[Intro: Arianna]
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hold up, relax, ain't nothin' goin' on, baby
Stop that, don't snap
You know your girlfriends are crazy
Fuck, just listen to me, though
There's nothin' to see, yo
You got to be crazy, I don't want no one but
You are so beautiful

[Chorus: Arianna]
I can't believe you could break my heart so easily
What did I do wrong? Don't lie to me
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?
Tell me the truth, who is it that you've been running to?
Where did you go? I need to know
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Look, don't react to what you hear, I'll explain it
Yeah, I was out with Ashley, but she's just a friend
So why do you keep chasing assumptions you thinking?
But you acting crazy, I don't love no one but
You are so beautiful

[Chorus: Arianna]
I can't believe you could break my heart so easily
What did I do wrong? Don't lie to me
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?
Tell me the truth, who is it that you've been running to?
Where did you go? I need to know
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?

[Bridge: Arianna]
Tell me where you are, you know I deserve to know
Tell me were you with her? You know I deserve to know
Tell me where you are, you know I deserve to know
Tell me were you with her now that I already know

[Chorus: Arianna]
I can't believe you could break my heart so easily
What did I do wrong? Don't lie to me
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?
Tell me the truth, who is it that you've been running to?
Where did you go? I need to know
Who did you, who did you love, love, love, love?
Who did you, who did you love, love?
