[Hook: Flo Rida]
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby

[Verse: RaC]
You’re a nice girl, who rocks mean shades
Can rock a nice fitted, you don't need no J'z
You’re all into school, you don't need to get paid
But you can jump in a pool, anytime, anyplace
Damn, I think I died cuz your looks kill
Some sixth sense shit, you can call me Bruce Will
Is it your mean demeanor, behind your back they be betting quarter mils
The game’s dirty, but your kicks stay cleaner still
You dropping dimes on that football field
You be killing it, girl you're just too real
You cheering for them Greens, wearing Chloe Jade Greens
Oh you fancy, huh?
Well stay fancy, then
You want them Valentino dresses even though
We know, that you are looking at your bestest
At all times, even when your hair is all messed up
But you don't seem to care and that just make me want to bless up
And I’m not asking but

[Hook: Flo Rida]
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
(I didn't want to use this instrumental, but it fit well)
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

[Outro: RaC]
(I actually can't whistle)
Just a little fun
I should be studying for exams, but oh well
Make a track you know
And you know who this dedicated to
Not the chorus though
Alright, RaC
