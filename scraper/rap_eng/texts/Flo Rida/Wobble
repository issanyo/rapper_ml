[Pre-Hook]
Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
I'm like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy, don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Hook]
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Verse 1]
It's like my head's back, been drinkin' out the bottle, I swallow
Some strong drank but really just my motto, she lotto
Jackpot, grand prize, champion franchise
Born ready and she get it right there on time
Early A.M., breakfast after the mayhem
Baby cause they don't make them like you, I hope that you hate them
Black card, that's a virgin, I keep 'em twerkin'
They're workin', that's why they're perfect, go 'head and purchase

[Refrain]
Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright
When you go down, down in my mind
Do what you want, that's what I like

[Pre-Hook]
Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
I'm like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy, don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Hook]
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Verse 2]
Wobble, wobble, satisfaction, my model
Show me you'll lead the way, and maybe I'll follow
Promise you ecstasy, long as you're here with me
No promise at all, my love be guaranteed
Cause baby I'll hit the throttle, make our way to the grotto
Private dancin' in there and some Playboy mansion tomorrow
It's all free, cause I agree you make 'em weak
Talkin' 'bout my knees, and the thing you need, girl

[Refrain]
Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright
When you go down, down in my mind
Do what you want, that's what I like

[Pre-Hook]
Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
I'm like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy, don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Bridge]
(Wobble)
Work, work, work, work, work with it
Don't stop, don't, don't stop, get it
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

[Hook]
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk
