[Chorus]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
You're such a hot temptation
It's such a sweet sensation

[Verse 1]
I got the wild ones, high ones, fly ones
Do or die ones, even shy ones
Hook, one, two, get to me, they going through, back to me
Nobody do it like you do that for me
Sheesh, don't blow half on the half top treats
Less talkin', let's 'cation at South Beach
Do some loose, wassup, I broke the leash
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all three eyes on the prize
Right now, right now, right now
I got a real good thing on the rise
Right now, right now, right now
And it's worth every bit of my time
Right now, right now, right now
I'm revved up, GTA
I'm tryna see you right now, what's your ETA?

[Chorus]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
You're such a hot temptation
It's such a sweet sensation

[Verse 2]
I got a payphone and a play phone
I gotta get it, baby, I could never stay long
I'm day one, hit 'em with the A1s, sauce
Since day one, not the A1s, false
It's a vibe, it's a vibe
Rockin' the champagne flute, hit the lights
Feelin' like a damn good time to be alive
You lookin' like a snack, shawty, pull it to the side

[Pre-Chorus]
You got all three eyes on the prize
Right now, right now, right now
I got a real good thing on the rise
Right now, right now, right now
And it's worth every bit of my time
Right now, right now, right now
I'm revved up, GTA
I'm tryna see you right now, what's your ETA?

[Chorus]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
You're such a hot temptation
It's such a sweet sensation

[Post-Chorus]
It's such a sweet sensation
It's such a sweet sensation

[Bridge]
Good vibration, oh
It's such a sweet sensation, oh
Good vibration, oh
It's such a sweet sensation, oh

[Chorus]
It's such a good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
You're such a hot temptation
It's such a sweet sensation
Good vibration
It's such a sweet sensation
You're such a hot temptation
It's such a sweet sensation
