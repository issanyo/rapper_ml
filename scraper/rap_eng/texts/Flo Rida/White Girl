[Verse 1: Trina]
Don Perion, people layin' on my lawn
Gettin' wasted by the cases
And my hair not even blonde
Wanna pull me over, see me crossin' over
I'm supernova, middle finger to a hater if you thought it was over

[Pre-Chorus x2: Trina]
Like ooh, shawty what it do
I wanna get loose and party like a white girl

[Chorus: Git Fresh]
Baby, I can hear the party get a little naughty
You turn me on
So baby, let me see you swallow
Drink it up the bottle
Let's have some fun
Party like a (white girl), party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl), party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl), party like a (white girl)
Party like a (white girl), party like a (white girl)

[Verse 2: Trina]
3am into the party, dressed [?]
4am wanna take me home [?]
I'm so throwed
OMG, I'm so wasted
Me and Katy waking up in Vegas
Say my name I'm famous but shhh, don't wake the neighbors

[Pre-Chorus: x2]

[Chorus]
