[Intro: Flo Rida]
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah"
Hot in here, bumping here, making us sweat
Your lil pedicure up on my chest
And we gon’ sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah," making us sweat

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, I,I be on that, wake up in the mornin'
Shawty, let's work
Gotta put it down on the drop on the clock
Be the last one to punch out first
A little bit of sweat won’t hurt
You’re a little bit hot, shawty, wet your skirt
Right up to the top, good sex, no shirt
I don’t wanna stop, baby, that’s the worst
Put in the hole
No, no feelin' like puttin' it in a girl
Go slow, good hillin' it get in with a jerk
You be lookin' at the ceilin' with your legs in the air
I be ready in a minute, don’t go nowhere
I’ma hold your hair
Give it 'til the finish, baby, let's go there
Givin' you the fitness, I'm that player, I’m so rare
Give me them draws like underwear
Passionate, smashin' it, st-sl-slappin' it, smackin' it
Up all night, all that graftin' it
I’ma do me, put my back in it
Lil mamma, you ready 'cause I got a telly
As soon as we leaving the club
If you wanna cut and I wanna cut
There ain't nothin' for me to disturb but I’ll be

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah"
Hot in here, bumping here, making us sweat
Your lil pedicure up on my chest
And we gon’ sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah," making us sweat

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey, look, look, look, look, look at your lady
We can take it from the bed to couch to the floor to the stove get so, so creative
Rip, rip it off, x-rated, sh-shawty we should get naked
Baby girl, that's if you can take it, sip a lil champagne and get faded
Hey, I wanna be the bling, bling
Ride, I'll get in my lane, lane
No time, my girl in the back of the Range
I'll beat like that, make you scream my name
So much cheek, you could touch the plane
Love them freaks when they rock with pain
Be my leach, girl, I want your brain
Wet them feet pretty much like rain
Su-such a mess put your pedicure on my chest
Shawty, you finna to get blessed
In a minute I'ma need my head rest
I don't want you to fight it, you like it, then let's get excited
I'll drop like a pilot, take it off soon as works in the diet

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah"
Hot in here, bumping here, making us sweat
Your lil pedicure up on my chest
And we gon’ sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah," making us sweat

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
Hey, I-I wanna be, wanna be your bath and body works
I-I wanna be, wanna be your bath and body works, works
I-I wanna t-t-taste your bath and body works
I-I wanna t-t-taste your bath and body works, works
L-let me s-s-smell your bath and body works
L-let me s-s-smell your bath and body works, works
I-I wanna li-li-lick your bath and body works
I-I wanna li-li-lick your bath and body works, works
Hey, oh baby, don't you want that good?
Oh baby, don't you want that hood?
Oh baby, can I do it like that?
Wake up in the mornin', got breakfast cooked
Shit shawty, you drippin'
What I want, then I know my job done
So went ahead with my pimpin'
Just know that I'm a whole lotta fun and I'll be

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be putting it down in a minute
How long will it take, before you're screaming my name? Oh, baby
We should rip off our clothes and get naked
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah"
Hot in here, bumping here, making us sweat
Your lil pedicure up on my chest
And we gon’ sweat, sweat, sweat
I'll be like, "Oh yeah," you'll be like, "Oh yeah," making us sweat
