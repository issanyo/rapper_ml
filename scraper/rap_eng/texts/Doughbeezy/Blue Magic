[Doughbeezy]

Blue Magic...
Let me roll up my window, as the indo get me blowed like a Nintendo
I'm cruising but I got my brim low tryna watch for Carl Winslow
FUCK the police that's a 10-4
So I turn and hit the signal
Just so I don't give these laws no reason to ask me for my info
Boys can't stop nor slow my tempo, highway light shining off the window
Just swung on two white sluts with two white cups po'd up for Big Moe
It's Doughbeezy bitch you didn't know, better run and tell yo' kinfolk
That I came to fuck the game I shoulda named this project nympho
It's yo' favorite rapper's rapper to hate on
Because I probably showed up to his party late, but then ain't stay long
I just tell these boys to stay strong cause I don't expect this niggas to understand
That I got plans of tryna turn these dollars into a hundred grand
Fuck what they talking 'bout, I love my city but really I'm tryna make it out
Get cake and bounce and turn my partners rubberbands to bank accounts
No mo' grams of white just stages and bright camera lights
And after shows all of these thirsty hoes treat me like a can of Sprite
I'm the man that you can't stand to like but aye I planned it right
I'm finally gettin shine and now these bitch niggas can't stand the light
My friend was right they can't stop a nigga with true talent
So I guess it's time to let these fools have it...
This is Blue Magic, where the music addicts pick up they new habits
Every verse I wrote so dope you can sell my tablet if you bag it
If you want it you can have it, but be careful of what yo ask fo'
Cause when you tryna be the shit you can end up looking like an asshole
I'm just cruising down on mash mode, tryna be the next new Astro... yea
A star in Houston about to sneak right out the backdoor
And show niggas that I'm back mo' focused serving an eviction notice
Cause that nigga mixtape you thought went hard can't even fuck with my show disc... ah!
I done seen a lot of ho shit, but it can't stop what God got planned fa me
I... see it in niggas eyes my buzz is sumthin they can't stand to see
All I got is family, faith, and my niggas that'll let you have it
Want respect you never gone get it unless you grab it...
