[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
It's the best in the West from the Southeast beast
Gold teeth, gold chain with a gold head freak
Yao Ming Mac-11, codeine purple heaven
'Cause I'm Max God bitch, pull a choppa' on the reverend
I catch em' I fetch em', If he run, autism
Hit em' with the pump, on Sherman Klump no professor
Compressor for the choppa', can't hear the gun clap
In a Jesus snap back with the alligator strap
Rata-tat-tat-tat gun clap get back like a shotgun pass
If my trap get sacked I'ma get my quarterback
Backpack got a Mac, Hardaway throwback, pinstripe, all black
Iraq, I attack, everyday, come back
Tony Parker, Rondo, two nines, Warren Sap
Clap clap get back like LeBron's edge up
Tomatoes get smashed till your man "catch up"
West up or vest up, no suit no tux
Cashew, Planters, lotta sluts on my nuts
Big bucks no Tampa, big shit no pampers
Leave em' wet with the tec, V-Tech no campus
Occupation domination Kream Clicc population
No hesitation cock and spray em', hundred bomb detonatin'
Levy breaking niggas, FUBU, Hilfigers
Go figure, squeezing triggers at you hypebeast niggas

[Hook: Lyndo C]
I'm flipping drops with invisible tops
Ho's bop when my drop steps by
Southeast, way back to the S.W.A.T
Yellow stone on West Belford block
You ain't from my hood you might get popped
Screens fo's with them fo's on chop
I'm flipping drop with invisible top
Ho's bop when my drop steps by
I'm with invisible tops
Ho's bop when my drop steps by

[Verse 2: Doughbeezy]
I'm drank sipping, paint dripping, top flipping like a bag flip
Rolling one [?] two Sweets and a bad bitch
In the old school sitting wide like a fat chick
With Maxo heading to the west
I'm in my zone on another level than the rest
I done came from the bottom now your boy a top dog
And boss hog be the only time we settling for less
Need the metal and a vest when you coming through the West
So you better be a beast when you rolling through the East
There's niggas in the S.W.A.T. that'll come in with the hollows
Straight through a nigga's head like a can of hair grease
And fuck a right price, there's niggas catching bodies at the mall for a pair of Air Yeezy's
So I stay strapped with a gat keep an extra clip in the whip like it was a set of spare keys
Trill, there's [?] and that Kream Clicc and we the best nigga fuck next nigga king shit
I keep a Glock on my hip so if a nigga want to trip I turn his white tee red like a screen print
Man the same niggas that I lean with are the same niggas I was broke and got green with
That's why they with me when I'm rolling with me when my top drop and my trunk popping my screen's lit when I'm

[Verse 3: Lyndo C]
(Kream Gang)
Lyndo be skinny jean thugging like fuck it so I gotta' keep the Tre 5 in my Levi's
Got OG vials of weed in my weed socks Lyndo stay dope know he roll deep
And nigga Kream live like the news at five but I stay fresh too death like my homie just died
Deadstock Jordan fives allegation by the ops but I hold my head high like a nigga with pride
Besides this dope that we smoking, ain't shit that you rolling more potent than me on this dope shit
My necklace is golden, the same as my ho is, imagine how good she gon' go with the Trojan
Bitches big Lyndo like I'm in they noses
She bought it and rolled it and after we smoked, it was all on track as a matter of fact, me Dough and Maxo like [?]
Flipping the bop then flipping the drop meanwhile consider the Glock diminish the ops
I just spit fire my tongue is a Glock and I'm sending them shots
We riding on pokers like a dot, she wants me to poke her like a dot
So she disappeared and gave me that mop, you know what that's called, invisible top
