[Hook:BeatKing]
She pop the pussy she throw it back (hol' up bitch)
She ttu (too turnt up)
She got them racks
She got a car
Her own house
Her own money
Her own (?)
She's on top she's on top
She's on top she's on top
She's on top she got guap
She's on top she's on top
She's on top

[Verse 1: Doughbeezy]
She poppin pussy for a purse but I swear when she throw that ass she need a shopping spree
She independent  and don't need a nigga that I have  to pay her bills or a doctor fee
That's the type of woman I like to wive
A booshie broad but still like to fight
She  so fine when she on  Instagram every picture she posts  I try to like it twice
Never need a ride or  try to stay with me
She got a own crib and a own car
A pack with bag with a sack of cash
Two credit cards and a lone star
Being VIP with a own bottles
Til I pour a glass  of  that purple
It's Doughbeezy bitch and when they play this song
I'm like  throw that ass in the circle , nigga
Want a man and  she  got a man I guarantee she will leave the nigga
Be classy but it get nasty type she'll fuck you first and then feed you nigga
She smoke weed and got a own bag
So don't need a manto  come roll up
And what's understood ain't  gotta be explained
They all understand when she show up
She on top

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got a bad bitch your bitch bad built
Got bad credit and bad breath
Mind on the grind
While your ho standing in the unemployment line tryna cash checks
A predict scale is a epic fail like a fat chick dancing on a glass desk
The only thing she good for is gimme brain like a nigga tryna study for a math test
I go to dreams for some chicken wings and some fried shrimp word to Lex P
The next week I was MV live getting head from a chick while I checked tweet
I called Big () tell them line them up I'm tryna go home with the best three
And they don't ride the dick like a surfboard they in the tub tryna ride like a jetski
I'm a thug like Slim and boss no hogg
I'm a dog but I ain't rocking neckleash
And if she got a man and he wanna trip
Then he ain't getting checked like a chest piece
See how the boppers be hatin the way she poppin' the pussy like bacon
And getting the cake while the bitches be caking
She shaking and throwing it back like she Payton
She on top

[Hook]
