[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Pull up to the parking lot, 84's they pokin' out
Lil' momma wanna see my rims
Can’t wait 'till I pull them out
Talk about 'em to her friends
They tellin' her don't ask me out
Cause they know just how I roll
Plus those hoes wanna ask me out
I take clips when I hit that strip
So I’mma do this to the casket drop
Wrist cold, and my jewels
Just like Baskin Robbins
Benz just like the whip
I’m trying to put momma in
You bitch wanna leave comments
I just use her face as my condom
My whip black, call it ebonics
Pockets fat, super humongous
Got two hoes lovin' to tongue me
And my whip call it jumanji
I’m an animal in this game, pull up
A barn never bummy want the bread don’t you crumb me
Swang wide, bitches love it!

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
I know you like my car
I know you like my ring
I’m living like a star, baby money ain’t a thing
She says she loves my rims
Says she loves the way I swang
Nigga grippin' wood grain, pussy drippin' candy paint
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Shit, these girls wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang

[Verse 2: Doughbeezy]
Ungh!
She say she lovin' the way I be swangin my slab
And how I be keepin that drank in my cup
Like Kirko, I'm bangin' and brangin' it back
Keep dank in a sack
Rollin up nothin' but sticky
I keep me a thicky
She call me to fuck and unbutton my dickies
She suck and leave nothin'- no nut or no hickies
I'm up in yo city, rollin' one deep
Got no niggas wit me
Dro in a mini
I used to roll lac now it's 4's on a hemi, wit screens hangin' down
Like an old lady titty
I keep 2 cups in my cup holder
Wit' yo gal sending me text saying come over
Cause I got Houston on my back like Slim Thug's shoulder
And I know you like my car, and love the way that I swang
When I grip the wood she grip on mine and give me head while I'm changin' lanes
And it's a shame, cause I know yo ass wouldn't fuck me on a huffy
But the fact that a nigga swangin' make all of the hoes love me, and I...

[Hook: Kirko]
I know you like my car

Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Your girl wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang
Shit, these girls wanna fuck me cause the way that I swang

[Verse 3: Slim Thug]
Way how to swang
Lane to lane while I grip the grain
Got your bitch peeping me when you ain’t peeping game
Fifty on a ring couple hundred on a chain
Went from being broke, to big ballin', man!
Man now I'm cool watch me do the damn fool
Breaking boys out homestead avenue (HOMESTEAD!)
Coming through!
All blue, some green
Repping for the team
And every single one clean
Not me your girl watching
Baby momma popping, I’m about to get what they want
Cause they won’t stop me
Drop it, it’s time to go and bag a mil'
Got every bad bitch on deck, but I only fucked 10
