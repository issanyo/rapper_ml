[Verse 1]
Look my car too clean for me to ride a feet or roll
So imma pay the cost if I see the toes
You seeing me broke you gotta better chance tryin' to see a troll
Bring back so many cheese that my pockets gon look like a pzza roll
Your ho's average my ho is the baddest
I treat these hoes like dominoes
I got two cups and I'm leanin
My cup thick and my bitches too


While I'm in my '96  impala all blue
Like Screw did it no cd player Just great taste in my deck
Don't fuck with new niggas
Got two triggers, no 2 Chainz
My crew bang like gang members
