Yea On the beat (Yes o)
On the beat, it's Davido and Super C
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
Dem dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the club DJs don dey play me
Now dey don dey follow
Everybody wan snap photo
Looking like I just hit the lotto
And you know that my neck is froze yo
And i am popping Rose
Every night na money we dey trowey
Balling from Monday to Sunday
Balling from Monday to Sunday (Sunday)
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo (Wash me like omo)
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me (want to play me)
Ma nogere Now dem don dey see me
Am the youngest bad guy on tv
Everybody just want to be me
Nobody just want to free me (just want to free me)
And I am talking my way
These days I be wishing my way
All the girls from Funke to Laide
Bad girls, from Funke to Laide
Bad girls, from Funke to Laide
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo
And I'm counting owo
I'm known from Yankee to Sango
All the girls dey wash me like omo
All the girls dey wash me like omo (Wash me like omo)
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me (want to play me)
Ma nogere Ki lo de today
Awon boys don hammer
By, just being an MC
After doing what needed to be done
They say I ball too much like Testes
Recognize a boss when you see one
Not in the same tax bracket that you belong
Like the next …………
To all the haters who exchanges things small or less
My money they say cut like money fresh
Not matching Mohammed, I mean Benjamins
Whole ‘nother class, not talking about the Benz I am in
See me sharing money like communion
To last my flow too tight like the lungs have asthma
Back when I was broke yo
Nobody wanted to jonze yo
All the girls they tell me no-no
Because I no get e motor
And dey used to hate me
All the same people don they hail me
All the marketers want to pay me
All the DJs want to play me (want to play me)
Ma nogere
