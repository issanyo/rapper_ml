[Verse 1 – Olamide]
Take a look at it like this
If I no get money like this
All these shuma no look my face
Them no go follow me to my place
I dey grind dey do my thing
I don dey see money since when I dey 19
When I go chop with my team
We dey pay for everyone wey dey the canteen
Now we don upgrade the matter
Daily and weekly and monthly and quarter
Now we don turn to butter
Family dey smile and we no get quanta
Dakun jen so yoruba
Make them no go forget say baddo na baba
Eruku de shi yapa
I dey tell them…

[Chorus – Davido]
Yeh give me the money eh
Biko nyemu ego
Orimi jekin jekin l’owo oh
Life is all about the money eh
