[Intro]
Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion

[Verse 1]
People stay
Then after a while its Auf Wiedersehen
Hello and goodbye is the game we play
But I just won't play by those rules
Baby, I'm not lost
Ima keep it one hundred till you’re what I want
Till there be no surprises about what page I'm on
I think that there's no mistaking
I hear what your body's saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…
So come on just let go
Right here in this moment
I want what you want now. (x2)

[Chorus]
I want what you want (x5)

[Post-Chorus]
Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion
Wonderful baby kill it with what you gossy
I want what you want now

[Verse 2]
People dance
Right round their feelings won't take a chance
That somehow somebody would feel them back
But I know you’re feeling me too
Baby let's not care
If there’s tomorrow or whether there is a future here
From our day one, I knew there was one thing clear
I think there is no mistake in
I hear what your body saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…
So come on just let go
Right here in this moment
I want what you want now. (x2)

[Chorus]
I want what you want (x10)

[Post-Chorus]
Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion
Wonderful baby kill it with what you gossy
I want what you want now

[Bridge]
Let's not care
If there’s tomorrow or whether there is a future here

[Pre-Chorus]
Cuz baby we don't know
Where this is going
But we won't slow down…
So come on just let go
Right here in this moment
I want what you want now. (x2)

[Chorus]
I want what you want (x10)

[Post-Chorus]
Talk to me
Real romantic
Looking eyes
Girl you killin’ with a fashion
Wonderful baby kill it with what you gossy
I want what you want now
