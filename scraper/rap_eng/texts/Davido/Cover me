Chilling in the club with my Don P
And the party popping
Everybody rocking
She say she wanna meet me

She say she wanna corner me
She say she wanna corner me
Cuz i got places in abundance
Oluwa cover me
Cuz Oluwa cover me
And if you try me you go see crase
Movement cover me
Omo Movement cover me
And I’m topping the charts now
I got everybody under me
I got everybody under me

[ Ellyman Cover Me Lyrics ft. Davido ]

Why you tryna come for a nigga with the sauce
Im just tryna make the club bump bump bump
Everywhere I go all my niggas we dey pop
But we just came here to look bumbum

Omo this is supernatural
Cuz your body natural
Girl you know your body bad eh
You got me thinking far

E ma lo fi mi sha ko
E ma lo shi mi balu
I don’t deserve this
Tell me what I did to you

Ma lo fi mi sha ko
Ma lo shi mi balu
Girl I don’t deserve this
Tell me what I did to you

Baby mi oh
Jowo oh
Baby mi jowo oh
Baby mi oh

Jowo oh
Baby mi jowo oh
