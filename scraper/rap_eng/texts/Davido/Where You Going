[?]
Pumas on, courtside (where you at)
Courtside, courtside, I'm ballin' while your on courtside
I'ma change lil mama to..
Baby I've been ridin with myself baby
If she can't get it she gone throw a fucking fit
She might just [?]
Your royalty she take her everything and everywhere
Popping lil things ain't a [?] in there
She stand still and walk around the facility whenever
[?], whats your


[Hook]
Out the motherfuckin' gutter
Tell me what you doin'
Shawty are you serious?
They gone kill you with your motherfuckin' son
Tell em where you goin'
You can be the host, I'mma fuck a lot of shows
In the Ghost
Baby, tell em where you going

[Verse: Blac Youngsta]
You pretty like a flower when you smiled at me
And went from, they doubted me
Behind my back, but in front of me smile to me
If I was your Illuminati baby would you die for me
[?] would you sacrifice your whole life for me
I got niggas in the penitentiary doin' life for me
Rest In Peace to all my niggas doin' life for me
Can't be fucking all of these bitches, cause they trifling
Can't be trusting all of these niggas cause they shiesty
I got shot three times, ain't dyin', ain't no fuck with me
If they give me life sentence, bae would you writin' me
Fuckin' with me from the beginning baby
If you want me, can you see me, it's because of me

[Young Thug]
I fly these bitches out, but they don't be  one of me

[Blac Youngsta]
Sendin' me texts, I don't wanna read

[Young Thug]
Talk about making a change, I wanna see

[Blac Youngsta]
If these niggas ever try me, I'mma stop their green

My lil niggas right behind me, they gone die for me
[?]
They amazed by my diamonds, look at that ice on me
