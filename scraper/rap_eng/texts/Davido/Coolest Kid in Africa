[Verse 2: Nasty C]
Uuh yeah
Goddamn, body smokin
Pass her to me
Fitted-pants, tight-top
That's a fake sassy to me
This' a different typa party
Book a table for three and buy a mattress for three
(Book it, book it)
You and your girl just came outta the closet
I'm happy for me
It's seven digits on receipts now
The money coming like a breeze now
The money calls me on repeat now
I let the Uber man eavesdrop
I got my riches from Africa
I'm the Coolest Kid in Africa, boy
I'm as humble as an amateur
Get up and pray and get the money afterwards (church)
Pockets never been deeper
Bitches never been shallower
If I throw a couple Geez up
And she'll prolly let my shadow fuck
And, she'll do it for a half a nut
She ain't take it to the reap
I EFT my plug a tip
And he delivers to the crib, yea
