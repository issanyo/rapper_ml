[Intro]
Heyo Ecool, drop the jam, na na, Ecool
OBO, fresh on the beat

[Verse 1]
And I publish the matter for your sake, you make a man misbehave
And if na fire for fire indicate o, cos me I no no again

[Pre-Chorus]
Filomina, I know me now, you know say that was a fucking mistake
What of Carolina, that one na gold digger, chai, so me I no do again

[Chorus]
Ada o, baby you are always on my mind, I think about you all the time
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby true love is hard to find, makes me wanna pay the fine
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby you are always on my mind, I think about you all the time
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby true love is hard to find, makes me wanna pay the fine

[Verse 2]
Me I go fire bazuka for you sake, as me I no come to play
As Ecool dey spin am for your waist, (Ecool, dey spin am) oh baby do you feel the bass

[Pre-Chorus]
Filomina, I know me now, you know say that was a fucking mistake
What of Carolina, that one na gold digger, chai, so me I no do again

[Chorus]
Ada o, baby you are always on my mind, I think about you all the time
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby true love is hard to find, makes me wanna pay the fine
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby you are always on my mind, I think about you all the time
Ye o, ye o, Ada o, baby true love is hard to find, makes me wanna pay the fine
