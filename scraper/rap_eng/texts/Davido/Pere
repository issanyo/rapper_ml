[Chorus: Davido]
If I give you one pere (pere)
You'll be coming back to me, you'll be begging for more
And if I give you one pere (pere)
You'll be coming back to me, you'll be begging for more

[Post-Chorus: Davido]
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so po mu pere oh
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so po mu pere oh

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Left the club because we're drunk already
Left your car but you'll come back and get it
If she did it then she don't regret it
Five gold chains, and now they think I'm sellin'

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I just ran it up for my people's sake
I just fucked that bitch on a birthday cake
Fuck me fifty times, this some
Told her I ain't play no games, ain't no Playstation
My dreads gettin' long and my niggas Haitian
I gave that bitch a bone just to penetrate
Baby I ain't never home, man I'm overseas
No US dollars, I got chrome faces
Pop a bean, get you eat out
Chains on my neck stand and they stay out
Every time she wanna fuck she come say, "may I?"
And call me mister if you want this payout
I stay at home in the bed all day
Bitch gave me head, I could play all day
Pussy comin' in, I get
I think bitches comin' in, I get slayed all day

[Chorus: Davido]
If I give you one pere (pere)
You'll be coming back to me, you'll be begging for more
And if I give you one pere (pere)
You'll be coming back to me, you'll be begging for more

[Post-Chorus: Davido]
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so po mu pere oh
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so po mu pere oh

[Verse 2: Slim Jxmmi]
Tattoo on my belly, glowin' like Belly
Young Makavelli, she gon' do whatever I said it
Know a nigga bread it, shining like Elvis
Two hoes to myself and I won't share
All I do is strike out, I don't never spare
Petty ass hoes, all these bitches welcome
All these bitches ready
If she in my bedroom then the bitch naked
Gotta get that back end
Big money on my mind, every minute, every second
Elevator to the top, where you headed?
I fuck her 'til I'm sweating
She been throwing that pussy ever since she met me
Said she lookin' for love, I say forget it
Nut on her back and that's where I left it
Snoop in with the camera when she undressing
She gon' do it for me like Simon said it

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
I been smokin' loud, yeah I wanna hear you yeah
I ain't got no etiquette, I cannot eat you yet
Poppin' bottles in the club, they got you doin' drugs
I'm a real nice guy so I'ma do 'em good

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Left the club because we're drunk already
Left your car but you'll come back and get it
If she did it then she don't regret it
Five gold chains, and now they think I'm sellin'

[Verse 4: Davido]
And if I give one pere now
Baby if I call you sho ma tete daun
I just want to make your boom boom pow, yeah
Yeah I just wanna give you love right now, ayy
Na we dey run the whole Naija oh
And everywhere we go, man we shut it down
And I'ma show you what life about, yeah
I get to stylin', I'ma show it off, yeah

[Chorus: Davido]
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so pe omu pere oh
Folake je mefa pere (pere)
Tinuke je merin pere (pere)
Malo ni omi kere
Talo so pe omu pere oh
If I give you one pere
