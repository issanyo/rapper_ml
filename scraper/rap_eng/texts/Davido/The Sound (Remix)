[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

[Intro: G-Eazy / Remo]
You know if I say something I mean it
These things happen
Yeah
If I ever said I'm never scared

[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
If I say that shit then I mean it
She calls me, I screen it, I'm only fuckin' if it's convenient
You lie on pussy, that's weak shit
We pass pussy 'round, that's G shit
But you ain't fam so what is this "we" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like "Who the fuck is this dude?"
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head
"I just wanna stay broke forever,"
Yeah that's that shit no one ever said

[Hook: Remo]
Never scared
Just know I mean it
If I ever said I fucked your bitch
Just know I mean it
And if I ever said I'm gettin' money
Just know I mean it
And oh Lord oh Lord knows
He knows I mean it
Yeah, you know
Oh yeah oh yeah

[Chorus: Davido]
See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound

See my baby, the way I love you, no deny eh
And i'm loving the way you dancing to the sound eh eh
Oya baby, move your body to the sound
Now Uhuru, kalawa jazmee na the sound
