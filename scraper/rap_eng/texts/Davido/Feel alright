(Ice Prince)
Yeah, oh
It's all good, now I'm blowing perf
See every time you scream, got me going tone deaf
You're overseas and I am trying get my own jet
So you ain't gat to worry about a nigga having phone sex
Ain't nothing compared to when we both flex
But when we argue you got me shaking on both legs
Now all the smileys and cute faces in those text really means shit no more, kinda of gross yet
You forget about the sick romancing
How you shake a nigga head is like sisqo dancing
Fryna be your bad boy, you pick those medicine
I ma go to J'burg and let the chicks know something
But currently i'm ego ranting, you ain't got enough to hear me, no eco sensing
Set things straight, mama me no blanking
If you tryna push aside, well me no skanking
Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Every time we fight about who is wrong or right
Pushing each other every day and night
Why can't we make things right
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
Pass me the, let me feel alright, let me feel alright
