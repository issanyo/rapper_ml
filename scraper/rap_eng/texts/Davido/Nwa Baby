[Intro]
Locked up, They won't let me out!

[Post-Chorus]
Baby no feeding bottle:
My baby dey wear the spaghetti;
She say, 'If you want it you can get it'
And i say, 'Ah, baby baby'

Damn !! Fresh on the beat

[Verse 1]
Shey you wan put me for trouble
(What is my) What is my crime?
O, you just thief my (just thief my) heart
(What if I) What if I die?

You must be a bomb o!
(You blow my) You blow my mind
(No be my) No be my might
'Cause you don change my (don change my) plan

(Ye!)
[Chrous]
I was locked up;
(they won't let me out, but you let me out)

And I don't need to say this;
But I gats tell you - Nwa baby

And I don't need to say this;
But I gats tell you - Nwa baby

[Post-Chorus]
Baby no feeding bottle:

She say, 'If you want it you can get it'
And I say, 'Ah, baby baby
Orisha ti o ba gbe mi, dakun wa pada leyin mi o'

You are the lyrics to my tune!
(Ye Ye!)

Many girls but you I choose (I choose you my boo o)
You are the reggae to my blues
And if I get you, girl, what will I do?
