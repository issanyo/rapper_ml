[Verse 2]
I never see this kind of girl before, them say na Kokonbu
I never see this kind of girl before
She say na remote
Baby come close to me give me some real passion
Come right here let me give you this love motion
Entertain me I want to see some action
If you give me ama give you the satisfaction
You're a girl you're a girl
Come and seat in my money
Go get down go get down cause I sing this song for you
Its that time its that time and I trust you go follow
To a place in the night time and I know say you go go

[Hook]
