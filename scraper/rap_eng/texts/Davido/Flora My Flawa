[Intro]
Baddest! damn! Fresh, on the beat

[Verse 1]
If your behind was my classi oh
I will never never miss school
See, your front turn to slippers oh
Cele go dey wear shoe
My baby na gold, my baby too dope
Was your Mother a dealer?
My baby na bomb, oh, she blow me oh
Was your Father a soldier?

[Hook]
Yaay! Flora my flawa
Awel'ewa mor'oun mu'bo fun'ye mi
If you say I’m good for nothing oh
Therefore, you’re bad for something oh
Flora my flawa

If nothing lasts forever oh
Me and you go be nothing forever oh

If nothing lasts forever oh
Me and you go be nothing forever oh
