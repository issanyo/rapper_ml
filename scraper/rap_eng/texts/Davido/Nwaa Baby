[Verse 1]
Say you wan put me for trouble
What is my, what is my crime?
Buy you don thief my, don thief my heart
What if I, what if I die
You must be a bomb o, you blow my, you blow my mind
No be my, no be my mind
But you don change my, don change my plan

[Chorus]
I was locked up, they won’t let me out, but you let me out
That shit was fucked up, they won’t let me out, but you let me out
I don’t need to say, but i gats yarn you Nwa Baby
Ye, ye
