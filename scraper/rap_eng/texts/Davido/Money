[Verse 1: Mr Eazi]
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
But that life ain't funny for me, for me
Cause I don't need that much money, money
See the thing about money, money
Soon as you get it everybody wants it
But that life just ain't for me
Cause the best things in life are free (alo, alo)
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
But that life ain't funny for me, for me
Cause I don't need that much money, money
See the thing about money, money
Soon as you get it everybody wants it
But that life just ain't for me
Cause the best things in life are free (alo, alo)

[Pre-Chorus: Kah-Lo]
I need that money, money
So I can keep myself fleeky, fleeky
If I want it, I got it
So trips to Capri is nothing, nothing
See the thing about money, money
Is I'm a fly girl who needs everything
But you keep on telling me
That the best things in life are free
I don't agree

[Chorus: All]
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go

[Verse 2: Davido]
You be acting funny (no way)
When there is no money (no way)
Thought you were my honey (no way)
Really thought you loved me 'yar (no mula, no love)
But you want my money
Baby, shake your body
I will give you money
I will make you happier

[Pre-Chorus: Kah-Lo]
I need that money, money
So I can keep myself fleeky, fleeky
If I want it, I got it
So trips to Capri is nothing, nothing
See the thing about money, money
Is I'm a fly girl who needs everything
But you keep on telling me
That the best things in life are free
I don't agree

[Chorus: All]
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go

[Bridge: Mr Eazi & Kah-Lo]
Everybody wants money, money
I need that money, money
Everybody wants money, money
I need that money, money
Everybody wants money, money
I need that money, money
Everybody wants money, money
I need that money, money

[Verse 3: Mr Eazi]
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
But that life ain't funny for me, for me
Cause I don't need that much money, money
See the thing about money, money
Soon as you get it everybody wants it
But that life just ain't for me
Cause the best things in life are free (alo, alo)

[Chorus: All]
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go
Money come, money go (zaga dat)
Money come, money go (everybody wants money, money)
Money come, money go (I need that money, money)
Money come, money go (everybody wants money, money)
Money come, money go (I need that money, money)
Need that (everybody wants)
Need that (everybody wants)
Need that (everybody wants)
Need that (everybody wants)
I need that money, money (everybody wants money, money)

[Outro: Mr Eazi]
Best things in life are free
Best things in life are free
Best things in life are free
Eh, baby girl best believe
Best things in life are free
Best things in life are free
Best things in life are free
Eh, baby girl best believe
Everybody wants money, money
To live in a location sunny, sunny
