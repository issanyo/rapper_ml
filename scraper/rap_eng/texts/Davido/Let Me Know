Lemme know, tell me some'in, baby no vex
King of the South, tell Cassper make he no vex
These rappers like zero-zero scores, 'cos they're goaless
I'm on my billionaire ambitions, girl, I'm so blessed
But, I guess, you already know
That I ain't kidding with the flow, 'cos I'm already grown
9/11 on the swag, and I am already blown
And, not here for the fame, 'cos i am already known here
