[Verse 1: Davido]
Girl you’re beautiful too
My number one tuntun
Sipping burukututu
For your love tutu
I go chook you chuku chuku o
Biko obianuju
Shey you do me juju
'Cause I'm feeling the juju
Shake it o, take it
I wanna catch it o, take it
You can have it o, take it
You know I got this o, take it

[Bridge: Davido]
I love you , I love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
There’s nothing above you
There’s nothing above you
Above you, above you
Bridget eh, I like your mini skirt o
Oh girl you carry sense o

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Hold up, if I give you all my money
Give you all my time, give you all my loving
Girl, would you be mine, all mine?
Take you 'round the world
If I make you my girl
Would you be, would you be there for me?
Girl, would you, girl, would you care for me?
Would you come running for my needs on the double?
Come and bail me out when a nigga get in trouble
Give me that loving wherever we lie
Poke, poke, poke, poke in the back of my car
And if we can get high
If we roll it up and we smoke it up 'til we kiss the sky
Ooh, you make me wan' say
I wanna touch you, baby, oh
Love you, baby, oh
Kiss you, baby, oh, freak you, baby
If I tell you that I want you, oh
Wanna hit it to the remix, oh
Baby, would you give me full control?
Would you green light me, just let me go
I give you sex never known before
Brace yourself, girl, 'cause I'm dangerous
Might be bragging, but I backs it up
So come try me, try me
Girl, you, girl, you, girl, you won't regret what I give you
Love like no other lover
Girl, you, girl, you, come and hop on and discover
If I played this remix for you
Girl, would you wine your body, body?
Girl, would you wine your body, body?
If I played this remix for you
Girl, would you wine your body, body?
Girl, would you wine your body, body?

[Hook: Davido]
If I tell you say I love you o
My money my body na your own o baby
Thirty billion for the account o
Versace and Gucci for your body o baby

[Outro: Davido]
No do, no do
No do, gararara for me
No do, no do
No do senrere o
No do, no do
No do, shakara owe
No do, no do
No do, gararara for me o, ehhh
