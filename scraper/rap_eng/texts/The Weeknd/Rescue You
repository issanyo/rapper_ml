[Verse 1]
Saw my signal from afar
Lonely heart sitting at the bar
I'mma try to save you from his flames
Come with me you don't have to think
You had a long day I can tell by your drink
Take a look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

[Bridge]
Do you always seem to fight cause I
(Can tell) You don't shed no tears and I (Can help)
Help you through your misery, hospitality that you need from me
(And girl) I can hear the pain inside (Your voice)
Argue every night but that's a choice and I can take it all away

[Hook]
Let me rescue you, I can see the truth
I can see right through the pain
Let me rescue you, let me fill his shoes
No more tears running down your face

I can take you there
Girl, fly you through the air
Girl, I can be your superhero
Fly you through the stars
And make light of your darkness
I can be you superhero

[Verse 2]
Tryna' free you from this cage
It's a mental prison break
Baby we can leave, my heart is the key
You're a damsel in distress
Looking at your eyes I can see the stress
Take a Look at me, I promise I will be
All the things you wanted him to be

[Bridge]
Do you always seem to fight cause I (can tell)
Don't shed no tears and I (can help)
Help you through your misery, hospitality that you need from me
