[Verse 1: Joe Grayston]
I, will be a star when I am 18
So, all of these haters will think I'm mainstream
Cause, too many sit back and just daydream
Well if, they step to me then they will be
Homeless, and corpse-less, these geezas bring no stress
I feel like Joseph, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you've got a problem then your girl single to me
Don't give a damn if you claim that you knew me
Grew up with no genre so nobody'll ever trust me
My flow so slick, some even say I'm too much, see?
I know it's gon' stick, I'll get all of you to love me
I feel you listen so I will be making money
Well, that's the life I'm tryna fantasize
Your bitch broke, be dropping down for 100 guys
Some day you will see me pulling up in Aventadors
Right now, I be grinding on them sidewalks

[Hook: Joe Grayston]
Sidewalks in my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks in my life
They showed me all the signs

[Post-Hook: Joe Grayston]
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

[Verse 2: Brig]
Say, say, say
I come from hustling jars for the pay day
Say, say, say
We hung all summer till dark tryna slang weight
Say, say, say
Writing songs in the garage while we play games
Say, say, say
You know its all for the squad how I maintained
Say, say, say
OG blunt, roll me one, only the KK
Then its bang bang
Lights out like the pg&e bill is overdue and ain't paid
And speaking of it shit it ain't paid
But I confess
That i contest
You tryna send
Me light for checks
And if i don’t comply then my lifes in debt
(Man that's fucked up!)
But that's just how the game go (game go)
Everybody tryna make dough (make dough)
All in it for the bankroll
They don’t give a fuck about the world
They would rather that it stayed broke
So I'm gathering the pesos
Tryna save me some so I can build a life
But they hate to see the real start to win
So they plot your downfall in the still of night
But that is ill advised cause I’m ready for it
I'm affraid to say that if you rain on my parade
Its a-okay cuz its already pouring
I embrace the rain and built a levy for it
To use it for my own advantage
Cack in the day when the people would hate it would get to me
I couldn't take it now see as motivation and demand it

[Hook: Joe Grayston]
Sidewalks in my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks in my life
They showed me all the signs

[Outro: Joe Grayston]
They don't let me down
