[Verse]
I'm not sweating, no way
Such a throw away
Got them sweating off a (sexy)
All day girl, our love (hmm)
And I don't take you for nothing
I'm good for you, don't you lie
Girl you know I can get sexy for you any, anytime
Yeah, just like you are, you are
Holding back every little urge that you have for me
You are, you are all the same girl
Only reasons
The reasons you can't have me, so easy to fix
But I feel like it's always something like
Don't you get me, I'm the same girl

[Hook]
No, I'm not having it
Now we're naked
Now we're naked
Tryna make it
No, I'm not having it
Now we're naked
Now we're naked
Tryna make it
