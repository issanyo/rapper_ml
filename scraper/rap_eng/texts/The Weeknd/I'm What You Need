[Verse 1: Aasim]
Maybe I wonder if I met you in some other life
Would you strip for me, then dip for me, lick your lips for me
Cause fronting is just bullshit for me
I’m far from falling in love with you
But I fucks with you
When I’m up in you, I’m in lust with you
Sip vodka in 2 cups with you
What’s up with you?
That lingerie fits nice on you
Fresh manicure let me fingerpaint you
French manicure, red bottom heels
Vicky secret, tell me you high maintenance ain’t you
Is it too much to touch you, fuck you and then don’t call you for weeks
In one breath you talk like you boojy but god damn you still grind like a freak
The tip of your tongue feels nice
You lick on my tatto feels right
Your light skin really glows in the light
I’m rock hard and your pussy so tight
He don’t even know how your clock work
He tries hard but can never understand you
Behind all that fancy shit is a sassy chick
You want a nigga to grab you
Pick up your light frame, blow you round like a dice game
Take a ride on my night train
Plus you hurt sometimes but it’s a nice pain
I can make your whole life change
And I go deep, you gets no sleep
My little rope, give you slowly
I make your knee caps and your elbows sweet
I got the ice cap for your cold sheets

[Hook: The Weeknd]
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
I’m what you need, I’m what you need
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
I’m what you need, I’m what you need
Lightframe, ...bitch, working on the counter trick
Throw it back, bust it open, put it down upon this dick
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
Lightframe, ...bitch, working on the counter trick
Throw it back, bust it open, put it down upon this dick

[Verse 2: Aasim]
Merry Christmas to unwrap you
Handle my business when I tap you
I relax you then I max you
It’s HD when I climax you
Put your head down now arch your back
Put your pillow upon to your stomach for leverage
Sex is the best anytime
But it’s best with a bottle of alcoholic beverage
I don’t wanna finish your sentences
I just wanna give you dick and affection
I don’t wanna sleep till noon
I wanna wake up in the morning with another erection
Put on another rubber protection
Play some wekend...selection
You giving me head is another suggestion
If your head game whack, find another contestant
Lights on is good, I wanna see your face
Lights on is good, I wanna see you naked
Legs on my shoulders, I wanna see you take it
And when you’re coming
Best believe I wanna see you shaking

[Hook: The Weeknd]
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
I’m what you need, I’m what you need
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
I’m what you need, I’m what you need
Lightframe, ...bitch, working on the counter trick
Throw it back, bust it open, put it down upon this dick
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
It’s what you want, it’s what you want
Lightframe, ...bitch, working on the counter trick
Throw it back, bust it open, put it down upon this dick
