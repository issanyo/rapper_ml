[Verse 1]
Telling me I’m the only one that you’ll love, boo
Baby, it's okay
If you let me stay
I won't love any other girl the way I love you
Baby girl just stay
I'mma take the pain away

[Bridge]
I'll make you believe that no one can do, when we do it
Show you that I know what I'm doing too, I'll prove

[Hook]
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby this our place, lemme kiss your face cause
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby I'm your man, just take my hand girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Baby hold me, kiss me, I'mma kiss and hold you
Because all the pace
We don't gotta race
Never thought I'd be the one you'd want to
Give away your heart
Gotta do my part now

[Bridge]
I'll make you believe that no one can do, when we do it
Show you that I know what I'm doing too, I'll prove

[Hook]
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby this our place, lemme kiss your face cause
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby I'm your man, just take my hand girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Break]
Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down
Break it baby, break it baby, it it it it down (It down)
Break it down, break it down, break it down

[Hook]
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby this our place, lemme kiss your face cause
Baby there's no love like our love
Baby I'm your man, just take my hand girl
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Our love, our love, our love, our love
Our love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
