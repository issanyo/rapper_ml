You bring good to my lonely life, honestly?
It's hard for me to look into your eyes, when..I say
That I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's aaamaaaa zzzzingggg

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson get out of it's way, cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life, that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decision
Owwwwwww, Owwwwwwww, OwwwWWWWWWwwwwww
