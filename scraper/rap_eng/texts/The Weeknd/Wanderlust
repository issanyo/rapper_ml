The more things change
The more things stay the same
Funny how everything is fleeting in this life
I’m the only one still standing here

Feeling like I’ve been going nowhere
I'm sick of being an empty void
Background noise
Just another person filled with regrets

There's beauty in the movement of the passage of time
But I've been standing here spinning on an axis

Wanderlust (wanderlust)
Motions not the sickness
It's all I know, wanderlust
Motion is the cure
I've always known that this feeling of wonder always fades

Let me float away to be somewhere far from here
In time I'll know what's left for me, there's nothing left for me
Let me float away to be somewhere far from here
In time I'll know what's left for me, float away

The feeling of wonder always fades
Repeating sequences play out in my head
The feeling of wonder always fades (fades away)
It's like an obsession

And I keep replaying everything I’ve ever said in my head
Over again, over again
I’m tired of talking to myself

As my breath hits the mirror, I'm more shrouded than I am clear
Breathe, just breathe
I don't recognize myself anymore

I'll be gone by first light, but will you rive in my absence
I've been feeling static, no more wiser

I’ve been stricken with wanderlust

Feeling like I’ve been going nowhere
I'm sick of being an empty void, background noise
I will take my voice to the forefront

There's beauty in the movement of the passage of time
But I've been standing here spinning on an axis

Let me float away to be somewhere far from here
In time I'll know what's left for me, there's nothing left for me
Let me float away to be somewhere far from here
In time I'll know what's left for me, float away

Day in and day out I'm trying to keep my feet off the ground again
Everything is fleeting, I'm the only one still standing here

Day in and day out I'm trying to keep my feet off the ground
I still believe, I still believe in all of this
