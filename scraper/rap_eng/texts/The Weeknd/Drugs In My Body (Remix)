[Verse 1: The Weeknd] (x2)
The sky is green
I'm feeling out of place
Bottle's of rum all to my face
I don't need a car, I don't need a chase
In lonely streets I'm looking for you

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Couple dark clouds, I see your face
Pull through the hurt, try to embrace
Poison in my soul, drugs in my veins
Anything you want baby, I will do
Girls, girls, girls, go

[Hook: Thieves Like Us]
The days they go slow
The nights they go fast
It's only some time
'Til we get together
I'm out on the street
I'm waiting for you
Do you hear me, do you hear me, looking?
The method is clear, in waiting for you
I think I need a distraction
I'm not staying in, I'm searching for you
I can never, I can never, find you

[Hook: Thieves Like Us]
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Come back home and we'll get somethin' started)
Stay up late put some heat in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Step back up I'm the life of the party
Go downtown put the drugs in my body
Go downtown put the drugs in my body

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Go and hop on a train
There's no one on board
I should take a cab
But I can't afford
Lost my money, I lost my phone
I just wanna make it home
Losing my voice, I need an autotune
Memories shady, but I remember you
And love is not a stayin' and it only brings pain
Take another hit I don't wanna be sober, oohhh
