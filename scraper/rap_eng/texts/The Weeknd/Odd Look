[Hook]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

[Verse 1]
I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, Iâ€™ll make you roll with a sinner, well
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah... ooh Lord

[Hook]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little lie, oh yea
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

[Hook]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
