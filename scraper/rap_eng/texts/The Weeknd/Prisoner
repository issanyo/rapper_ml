[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly
It’s hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say that I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it’s amazing

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams
