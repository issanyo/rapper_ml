[Chorus: Belly & The Weeknd]
I will never be what you need but
I got what you want
You just wanna spend my cash and smoke my weed
I got what you want
You've been up for days, can't get no sleep
I got what you want
See the sauce drippin' off from the heart that's on my sleeve
I got what you want
Oh yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I got what you want
See it in your eyes, you just tryna get on
I know what she wants
She got more issues than a magazine
I had a girl named Mercedes, used to love it when she bends
When she make me mad, I leave her ass on read
I never let these girls get to my head
I'm too busy countin' all of this bread (Oh yeah)
What can they say to me?
'Cause if I left then they wait for me (Then they wait)
What can they say to me? (What can they say?)
I keep it G and she knows it

[Chorus: Belly & The Weeknd]
I will never be what you need but
I got what you want
You just wanna spend my cash and smoke my weed
I got what you want
You've been up for days, can't get no sleep
I got what you want
See the sauce drippin' off from the heart that's on my sleeve
I got what you want
Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Belly]
Pin drop, pin drop, ten o' clock, ten o' clock
Hit the inbox, I'll be in the box (I'll be in the box)
But she so bad (So bad), got 'em all shook (All shook)
Said she want to ball, she get the hard work (Get the hard work)
Oh yeah, she super dope (Super dope), still high (Still high)
I can't even tell you what this feels like (What this feels like)
Oh, oh, real life (Real life)
Wake up every morning and I feel high (Leggo)
I got a bitch in the projects, yeah, she faithful and honest
Never went to college, she got collagen in her body
You don't need that type of knowledge when you pretty and polished
She don't even drive a car but she been wrackin' up mileage (Yuh)
I got everything, lows, highs, show off anything
Told her, "Hold tight, go light with them heavy things"
I'm not what you need, can't front
Back up, baby, I got what you want (What you want)
Yeah

[Chorus: Belly & The Weeknd]
I will never be what you need but
I got what you want
You just wanna spend my cash and smoke my weed
I got what you want
You've been up for days, can't get no sleep
I got what you want
See the sauce drippin' off from the heart that's on my sleeve
I got what you want
Oh yeah

[Outro: Belly & The Weekend]
I got what you want
I got what you want
I got what you want
I got what you want
