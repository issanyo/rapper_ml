[Intro: Bryson Tiller]
This is
This is not a mothafuckin' game, why you playin', boy?
I'm just sayin', boy
Yeah

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Yeah, Rambo
They beggin' for mercy, like the Lambo'
Know they told me kill 'em all, goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fuckin' killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em 'cause I can though

[Verse: The Weeknd]
I just signed a deal so big that it's a secret
Victoria's Secret Angels dancin' 'round me for a reason
Spread your wings for me like I'm Freddie Mercury
But baby, you should call me king, you know that it's my season
I'm out to re-up, made another killin' in Reno
I couldn't leave her until I paid a visit to P.O
Too much tequila, I had too much tequila
They cuffed me like I was single, fuck it I'm back to Henny
Thank the lord, didn't kill me in the elevator
Wasn't my time, saved my soul, save it for later
Cheat death that day, never played fair
Roll stress all day, blow it in the air
Had to kill the pop game so they know what's up
Now I'm poppin' back swift, had to shake it off
Sobriety is an enemy, I'm sorry momma
Society now acceptin' me, pray for the young ones
I'm from the Scar town, city no love
From the town where a nigga never ever blow up
Now they love me cause I shine, shawty
If you ain't fuckin', then it's time, shawty
I see the truth inside your eyes, shawty
If you don't love me then you lied to me
If you don't love me then you lied to me
Swallow all your pride for me
Or you can swallow all the time for me
Now you can tell me how that taste, girl
Gene Simmons tongue but I ain't down for the kissin'
My nigga got a scope, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the rinsin'
My nigga’s hittin' notes and I ain’t talkin' ‘bout the singin'
I'm breaking billboards for my city, got me thinkin'
I'm a motherfuckin' villain in my town
Heath Ledger, 'bout to O.D
Married to the game, I ain't never gettin' cold feet
Killin' all these lames, lot of motherfuckers owe me
I just stay quiet, I just let the money climb high

[Hook: Bryson Tiller]
Like Rambo
They beggin' for mercy, like the Lambo'
Know they told me kill 'em all, goddamn though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am though
On two feet, that's where I stand though
I'm a true fuckin' killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em 'cause I can though

[Outro: Bryson Tiller]
This is not, this is not a
This is not a mother-
A mothafuckin' game
This is, this is not
This is not, this is not
This is not
A mothafuckin' game, why you playin' boy?
I'm just sayin', boy
I'm just sayin', boy
That's all
God! Tiller!
