[Verse 1]
I'm hella posted in the TRUMP now
I think I've finally fell in love now
Her name is Tammy, she got hella bitches
She let me fuck 'em while my niggas film it
My place so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
She cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby, man, I love my baby
Trust me, trust me, I love my baby
Man, I love my baby, man, I love my baby, trust me, trust me

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, oh, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I turned the Ritz into a pole house
It's like eviction number four now
Go 'head an' ash it on the floor now
Girl, go 'head an' show me how you go down
Man, I feel my whole body peakin'
An' I'm fuckin' anybody with they legs wide
Got me higher than a nigga from the westside
Eastcoast nigga reppin' northside, never waste a ho's time
Bitch, I'm on my own time, fuck a nigga cosign
'Cause I get it better like proline, baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service still cost your whole life
Nigga try to me step me, I go all-out military
I'm camo'd all-out like I'm in the military
Free my nigga Jack, wish he was out in February
Perfect time to come out for the album drop
But this shit a throwaway

[Chorus]
I got 'em sweatin' off a throwaway
Man, this shit is such a throwaway
(This ain't that album shit, man, this just a throwaway)

[Verse 3]
I don't seem to have you niggas 'round me
All I do is cut niggas from 'round me
An' they know the reason why they got cut
You can lie to the press just to get a buzz
'Cause these niggas know that I do everything
Puppet master over heads, I'm pullin' strings
Nigga, I'm the reason everybody gettin' high
Singin' slow, rockin' camo tees and white hoes
But they can have it, I touch any lane
Man, it don't matter, kill it anyway
Arenas in the spring, I'm hella paid
That means hella face, hella mouth, hella brain
These bitches goin' hard, they losin' shame
I got 'em trainin' like they losin' weight
I'm in Miami, I fuck every day
I never slow the pace, this shit's a throwaway

[Chorus]
I got 'em sweatin' off a throwaway (yeah, mhm)
Man, this shit is such a throwaway, yeah, yeah
(This ain't that album shit, man, this just a throwaway)
