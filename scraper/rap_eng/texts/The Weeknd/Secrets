[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I've spent most of my time
With you chasing 'round my vice
You must have known you weren't the only one
So when your lips are telling lies
I can tell when you recite
I can see myself through your eyes

[Bridge: Jr. Hi]
You know what I want, I won't say it
You know what I want, I won't say it, babe

[Hook: Jr. Hi]
Because now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(How you feeling?)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Girl, I've learned to use your love
Me and you, we're not the same
You can't use someone who never trusts
Inconspicuous and vain
Me and you, we're not the same
Didn't have to be so obvious

[Bridge: Jr. Hi]
You know what I want, I won't say it
You know what I want, I won't say it, baby

[Hook: Jr. Hi]
Because now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
Burning me, child

[Verse 3:Jr. Hi]
Well, I'm a sucker for that kind of magic
Fucking like we 'bout to start our own Noah's Ark
Cause even though we was automatic
We never kept a secret in the dark
When you make up your mind
Baby, call me please

[Hook: Jr. Hi]
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(How you feeling?)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
(It done sent me out my mind)
Now your secret's burning me
Now your secret's burning me, child
