Momma made me never had a pops
Streets cold nigga clutch a Glock
Touch mine and we gon' split you top
Took you whole check and toe tagged your shop
The world is mine I need a hundred blocks
I don't leave these nigga took a hundred hops
Try to touch the kid we send a hundred shots
Try to touch the kid we send a hundred shots
No time for a fuck nigga
Hate to have to go and end a nigga
Lit a now I'm the next nigga
Feeling like I'm the next Jigga

Good chicken we'll pluck a nigga

Mellow mobbing nigga legend loaded

Touch of evil nigga but my heart holy

Trying to ease the pain nigga keep it going
Plenty diamonds ya my wrist snowing
Plenty diamonds ya my wrist snowing
Niggas talking money never seen a check
Kill 'em all we don't leave a threat
Spend it all nigga no regrets
Spend it all nigga no regrets
Keep it 100 while they telling lies
Head shots calling aiming high
Keep it one thou 'til a nigga die
