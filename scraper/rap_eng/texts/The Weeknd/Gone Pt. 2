[Intro]
Turn the lights down

[Verse 1]
A hundred and one days to sing a …
I could be the nigga delivering all day
Have your body sweating and shivering while you say
Your body does it better whenever you wanna play
I could be a phone call or email away
Well, I ain’t gonna beat it and leave it, I might stay
With a bucket of ice, I got bottles of rose
And a playlist prepared, get naked and press play
I leave you on your back, I nibble on your neck
I’m lick your inner thigh, you’re starting to get wet
I’m looking in your eyes, you’re just about set
I lick you on your nipples, know the whole bed’s drenched
Then I slide in, but never too fast
I’mma take it slow, making every minute last
We can do it in the car with your legs on the dash
But we’re never rugged it I’m living with it in a smash
With your fine ass

[Hook]
Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?
Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?

[Verse 2]
I love it when you bend it, arch it, then throw it back
Reach under your stomach and grab my whole sack
Then you get on top, move your body to the track
Back bouncing to the base and you make that ass clap
And every time we do it, it feels like a porn
We do it, go to sleep, back at it in the morning
Let the neighbors watch, keep the silk shades drawn
The silk sheet smells like somebody got it on
In the middle of the day while you sitting at your job
Pussy start to tingle, both nipples rock hard
Sweat up on your brow while you listen to the …
Thinking ‘bout sex feel a little crossed on
A hundred and one ways to …
A little champagne, some liquor and foreplay
And when you dance it’s like stripping is your forte
Working my pole while …came track number four play

[Hook]
Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?
Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?

Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?
Break it, drop it, touch your body
Tease it, feel it, clap on it baby
Don’t you want to?
