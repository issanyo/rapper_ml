[Verse 1]
What do I gotta do, just to get your attention
When all I do is love you, oh you're just messin'
It's okay though, I'm used to it
But all those cuddles and kisses, yeah I'ma miss it
This ain't no break up song, I'm only saying what I feel
Real lyrics so people can actually feel
What I go through, just to make someone happy
You bet I'm probably tired of it, but in reality
Ain't no one's gonna be able to stop me
From loving anybody else, you see
I'm not obsessed, I'm only expressing myself
But that only leads to trouble, though...cause

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
Cause you said you wouldn't hurt me, shit that was a mistake
Took me for granted, looked passed back, but still got hurt, mate
But it's my time to stand up, for myself, man up
Cause no one's gonna be by my side when I end up in ashes
So take an ecstasy, am I your ex to be
Are you using me as a rebound
Bet that, why wouldn't I, you're a hound
It's a little too late to apologize now
So forget how, you talked about your ex to me
How you would forget about him, bullshit you see
Your dumbass isn't gonna forget that easily
'Member when I said I'll call you, well...

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
