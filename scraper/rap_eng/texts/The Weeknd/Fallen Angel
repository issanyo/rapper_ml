{Verse}
I stripped your sins
Then I clipped your wings
Leave the diamond at the door, pearls on the gate
You took advantage of the pills I take
For forgiveness get on your knees
Under the sheets, I swept your pleas
Temptation delivered you Heaven sent
On my idle hands, there's no Heaven scent
Back & forth I dragged you through Hell
You cased my suits & bagged your smell
On top of the church you spread wide
I broke your heart & I bled inside
Halos are fallin' down
For your feathers, demons are crawlin' around
In my ill-terminal love, you was baptized
Evil sewed my mouth, covered my ears & wrapped my eyes
