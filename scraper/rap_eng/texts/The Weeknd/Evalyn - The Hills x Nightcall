[Verse 1]
Your girl on the road, she doing promo
You said keep our business on the low-low
I just tryna get you out the friendzone
Cause you look even better than the photo
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Bridge]
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where its dark, but have no fear

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love you when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time i'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, baby

[Verse 2}
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Well these drugs got me feeling like it's decaf
I just wanna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Bridge]
I'm giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear
I'm gonna show you where its dark, but have no fear

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love you when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time i'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, baby

[Verse 3]
There's something inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
Hills have eyes, these hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
