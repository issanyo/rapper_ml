[Intro]
2 Cups

[Verse 1]
Can't be sober for a day, I be feelin' too lost
They try to make me turn down
Tell me: "Put the hammer down!"
I'm finna lose control
And she can watch me fuck it up
For a little one night
I'm in the presidential telly
Pelle Pelle, True Religion, with some bitches smokin' dope
I told her: "Break some, then cum
Shorty, you ain't gettin' in, fuck is you from?"
Boy, in the field, it's real, you gotta keep a pole
And you have to understand where a grown man comin' from
So free my niggas that ain't never comin' home
They told me about this, and I said:

[Hook]
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for (Dope)
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for (Dope)

[Verse 2]
This the shit that I live for, a lot of money and a lot of hoes
A lot of guns and a lot of clothes
Getting dumb brain, no honor roll
Fake niggas, I don't honor those
You a fake nigga, can't relate to you
Real talk, I'm a real nigga, so I ain't got shit to say to you
And please don't get me confused a lot of niggas I'm cool with
They is not gon' do shit
Nigga, put it on him if that shoe foot!
Never really gave a fuck at all, but now a nigga don't give two shits
Never gave a fuck what they called me, I bet a nigga couldn't prove it
Don't pay attention to the fuckery
Fake niggas don't fuck with me
Real niggas only fuck with me
If you fuck with me, then you stuck with me

[Bridge]
Don't really know how to do this part, you know I don't sing
Talkin' shit on Twitter, got up with him, I'm like: "Nah, don't scream!"
Mensa, I remember what you said about all those things
Money, cars, clothes, I promise we gon' have all those things

[Pre-Hook]
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for
Test the fire, I'll steal for him
If it's Mensa, nigga, do a drill for him
All my homies that went down in this shit, nigga, I feel for 'em
That's the reason I'm still going
Tryna get rich, sign a deal for 'em

[Hook]
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for (Dope)
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for
This the shit that I live for, this the that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the niggas I kill for (Dope)
