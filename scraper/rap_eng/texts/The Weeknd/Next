[Verse 1]
Woah
She popped that pussy on a Monday
She never falls in love
But she heard me in the club, she couldn't run
She wanna give me all her money
She used to spend it all alone cause her man went and did her wrong, so she
But baby I'm not tryin' to be the one
I got my baby waitin' home
She been too good to let that go
And I ain't tryna win your heart
And you can't pay to win my love
So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'
Keep dancin', dancin', keep dancin'
