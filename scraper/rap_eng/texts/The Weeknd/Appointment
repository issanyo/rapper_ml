[Verse 1]
Got my fancy clothes, and the candles lit
Dinners getting cold, can't quite seem to sit
I have been anxious all day
Ever since you called, you called
Got the water runnin', just like you said
Now my body's burnin' and I start to sweat
I could never do what we do all alone
Alone

[Hook]
Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waitin' in my bed
You’ve been busy in my head
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you

[Refrain]
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment

[Verse 2]
Now I feel the urge, I hope you feel it too
Now imagine girl what I'mma do to you
Girl the image of your body got me sprung, me sprung
Never felt like this about another one
You are killing me girl cause is half past one
My body trembles every time my clock agrees

[Hook]
Girl it's half an hour past ten
Got me waitin' in my bed
You’ve been busy in my head
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you

[Refrain]
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment

[Hook]
Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waiting in my bed
You’ve been busy in my head
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you

[Refrain]
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment

[Outro]
I wanna fuck you, I wanna fuck you, I wanna fuck you
