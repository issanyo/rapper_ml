[Verse 1]
You want me, but he needs you
Yet you're telling me, that everything is good
Trying to convince me, baby, to do as you say
Just go along, girl and see things your way

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (down low, babe)
(Nobody) nobody has to know
(Oh, oh, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Secret lovers is what you wanna be (wanna be, wanna be)
While making love to him, girl, you're silently calling on me
What is a man to do in a situation like this? (again)
I feel there is something, that I
I don't wanna miss

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (down low)
(Girl, nobody) nobody has to know (oh, girl, I go
(Oh, oh, yeah)
Keep it on the down low (down low)
(Girl, nobody) nobody has to know (nobody, nobody, nobody)

[Verse 3]
Beautiful you are, but you're his by far
Coming by my way, driving his fancy car
Making plans to be in my life forever
Tell me, tell me, that we'll always be together

[Chorus]
And keep it on the down low (oh, whoa, yeah)
(Nobody) nobody has to know (oh, girl, I go, oh, oh, yeah)
Keep it on the down low (down low)
(Girl, nobody) nobody has to know (nobody, nobody, nobody)

[Outro]
Keep it on the down low
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Down low, down low, down low, babe
