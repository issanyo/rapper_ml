[Refrain]
They starting rumors all about anything
They wanna ruin us and get crazy
They talking reckless then the ones I know
I see them hatin' and now I get taller
My baby, I just wanna get love found
I look at you and now I get taller
I see that you gon' work your tempo
I may go out tomorrow, may stay low

[Chorus]
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
Make love to, make love to, make love to, one love
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
All that love, all that talk, give me love
Say what you will say, say what you will say
All you will say, oh love

[Bridge]
I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody

[Refrain]
They starting rumors all about anything
They wanna ruin us and get crazy
They talking reckless then the ones I know
I see them hatin' and now I get taller
My baby, I just wanna get love found
I look at you and now I get taller
I see that you gon' work your tempo
I may go out tomorrow, may stay low

[Chorus]
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
Make love to, make love to, make love to, one love
They wanna, they wanna, they wanna
All that love, all that talk, give me love
Say you what will say, say what you will say
All you will say, oh love

[Bridge]
I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody
I need you, I need somebody
If it's true, I need somebody
