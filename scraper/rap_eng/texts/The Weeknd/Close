Close, Ahhhhhh, Nagy

It's the Weeknd and I'm wondering if you got lust
Cos previously I knew, you never had trust
Now it's become more than a nut bust
I love you more than bread crust
I met you when I was lost
Shirt said I'm not fucked
Shutter shades and some bum fluff
Walking round the club like my brain got concussed
And you knew you could conquer
That's when you looked at him and you thought to yourself
Damn I want some
And fuck these other scum
Sipping on their rum
Chewing on their gum
At thee, I bite my thumb
Fuck with them and their mum
We bout to have some fun
Did you not know you are my son?
Bitch, why you think we look like one
Why you look so dumb, why you look so stunned
I'd still lick you up with my tongue
Fire my gun, at your buns
Bitch don't make me drop that thun thun thun

Fuck Ebola, Fuck Sosa, fuck anorexia nervosa

You look at me, humbly
Constantly in good company
Come to me, looking hungry
Monkeys climbing money trees
As if they own the streets
Spend all the leaves, smoke all the green

What you want
What you want
What you want
What you want

What you need girl
What you need
What you need girl
What you need

[Hook]

What you breathe
Bitch, I'm what you breathe
Watch you watching me as I watch the TV

Coming through, I'm tumblin'
Bitches drunk, they stumblin'
I'm mumblin', my stomach grumblin'
Hungry from all the moist shit that I'm hearing
Got me feeling, I'm worth a million
A minion, bitch, I'm brilliant, billing them a billion
And all those mother fucking villains
Getting shillings while they're chilling
Sipping sizzurp talking bout killing
Spitting unappealing lyrics
Whilst they're sitting on their Calvin
Klein, while their bitches behind
Rob your gold underwear whilst your sitting right there
Tie a shirt round her mouth, like she's in an affair
Hit her from the back, then pull her hair
Let her give fellatio, as we listen to the radio
(That's my favourite song!) Girl come back here
For I come right there
I been craving you like an avocado pear
You belong on the front of vanitity fair
You could be a pornstar or multimillionaire
Back to planet earth I was walking on air
Spit so dirty might need dental care
But if I gave a care I'd read a book of common prayer
My mind so ill it needs tender love and care
I'm so, raw, could get put behind bars
But I'm a crazy muddafucka, like any other star
Guess that makes me regular

[Hook]

I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need
Bitch, watch me leave

[Hook]

I'm what you need girl
I'm what you need

Whoah, whoah, whoah
That's a fatass spider
Fuck, Not another one
Another one
