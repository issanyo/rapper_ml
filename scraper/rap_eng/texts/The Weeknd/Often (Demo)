[Verse 1]
I used to love sleepin' all alone
So, baby girl, bring your friend with you
Now, we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me takin' sneak pictures either
I had her climbin' all up on the wall
Plus, her head-game so fo'sure
A good one, nigga, my one
I get her wet an' then look down
Man, it's so fo'sure

[Chorus]
I'ma sing this song 'round your team, often
Boy, won't [?] on your man, often
I'ma do this song, fly away, often
Baby get too close to the team, often
Often, often, baby get it often
Oh, no, gimme top, then
Get it how you want it
Often, often, baby, do you pop it?
All this on your top, then
Get it how you want it, often

[Verse 2]
Many women love the fame-status
I'ma need it often
You ain't clean your chain with the payment
I come around, man, she leave a nigga, ain't, man
Every in the game, yeah, we made it
I been drinkin' all my pain, need a new plan
What you mean, been bussin' [?] on her forehead
[?] take a cold shower

[Chorus]
I'ma sing this song 'round your team, often
Boy, won't [?] on your man, often
I'ma do this song, fly away, often
Baby get too close to the team, often
Often, often, baby get it often
Oh, no, gimme top, then
Get it how you want it
Often, often, baby, do you pop it?
All this on your top, then
Get it how you want it, often

[Bridge]

All for love
I just need someone to feel love
If you need something, come wait a lil'
Don't try hold this up
Girl, how you do it, girl?
But I need you somethin'
But I need your love
