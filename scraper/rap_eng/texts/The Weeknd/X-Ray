[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

[Verse 1]
Beaming through your door
I see right through your faults
Eyes tryna feed me more lies
Girl I’m on top, of all your little side plans
All your little side mans
All in for your waist and I must have been out my mind

[Pre-Hook]
Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying find out if your heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

[Verse 2]
Running through them boys
You play me like a toy
And 'bout to here that noise
When I find out your thoughts girl
Sweating on the outside shaking on the inside
Girl I’m reading your mind
And it's filled with lies

[Pre-Hook]
Girl you had to be so slick to go through all them
Bad dudes, had to be the first to stop you cause

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying find out if your heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

[Verse 3]
Girl you're out of love
Girl you know you're out of love so
Pack up all your stuff
Girl you had your chance
But this time, this time was your last

[Hook]
I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying to figure if your love’s fake
Give or take, couple days
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane

I’m looking through you like an x-ray
I’m trying find out if your heart breaks
Can it break? Is it fake?
Should I wait? Am I late?
Thinking hard, got me going insane
