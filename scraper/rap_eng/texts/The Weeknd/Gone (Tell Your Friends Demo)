[Intro: The Weeknd]
Gone
I'm gone
Gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need your love no more
Said I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
You don't need to talk no more
Cause these kids already on
Now these kids already on
Said I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need your love

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to walk around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if she wanna fuck my niggas, she got choices
I told her not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Cause these kids already are, cause these kids already are
Cause these kids already are, now these kids already are
Said I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need you love no more, I'm gone
