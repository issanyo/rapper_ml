[Verse 1]
Type that you get ahold of, you get all, my babe
Tell her why she can fill up my cup, whole body
After she get a whole bottle, that 100ml babe
What'd she take? Slip in what she take
I've been gettin' too pained, I should go paint, oh babe
I'm thinking it so much, get nobody
After this, you can't save her, she want nobody
Flying now, babe
Go now, take

[Pre-Chorus]
What are you? Oh tell me, I do
Only you, oh tell me I do
How are you gon' tell me I do?
How are you gon' tell me

[Chorus]
She making money 'til tonight
She's been opened up
Getting open now
Getting open now
She up for clubbing for tomorrow
When it's open now
When it's open now
When it's open now
She really bout it 'til the mornin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell you, "Get low," once I get your body
Spend [?]  you can't tell nobody
Grab enough get drunk tell enough to me
Don't lust for me, tell her [?]
I'ma let you get torn up, you get torn up on me
I'ma let you get [?] on me
I'ma let you get [?]
Tell you how's your day
Tell me how's your day

[Pre-Chorus]
What are you? Oh tell me, I do
Only you, oh tell me I do
How are you gon' tell me I do?
How are you gon' tell me

[Chorus]
She making money 'til tonight
She's been opened up
Getting open now
Getting open now
She up for clubbing for tomorrow
When it's open now
When it's open now
When it's open now
She really bout it 'til the mornin'
