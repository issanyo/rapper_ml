[Verse 1]
I don't really know, when I know you're saying
I've been living down, every note you're saying
I don't mean enough, but I know you're saying
I've been taking all you know, but I know you're saying
Ooh when I know you said
Ooh when I know you say

[Hook]
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up

[Verse 2]
I don't really know, when I know you're saying
I've been living down, every note you're saying
I don't mean enough, but I know you're saying
I've been taking all you know, but I know you're saying
Ooh when I know your said (say)
Ooh when I know you say (Ohh, baby)

[Hook]
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up

[Verse 3]
I was posted up in Berlin when you called me
It was early, yeah
I just got that picture that you texted
You look ready, girl don't tempt me
I'm flying down, to shut it down
You tryna buy your ticket to me, [?]
Seems like my name, but I hide that shit around
Whatever makes you feel like you the baddest bitch around
I know that your other man, got feelings for you
Well now that I'm calling back, what you got is through
And I want to know you bae, are naughty
And don't say nothing babe, to nobody
I make it to [?], she gave her selfie
I make it to [?], I know you gon' be
I made it to tomorrow bitch
I make it to pussy
I made this song
I don't be on, shut the fuck up

[Hook]
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
Tell them all to wait inside, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up, when I'm pullin' up
When I'm pullin' up
