[Verse 1: Jesse Ray]
She got a mouth full of lies, a pocket full of cash
The money makes her blind behind her new eyelash
Cruising on a plane with the backstage pass
She wants more loot - she got backstage cash
Always wanna shop, always wanna make it stop
Four thousand dollar watch and she doesn't even watch
When she has goals I tell her to take a shot
And when I have goals she ask me about the guap
It's like twelve o'clock baby come it's getting late
Finish up your plate, cause my pockets overweight
Her favorite food is cake, and her favorite word is safe
But my safe ain't safe when she up in my place
Fingerprints straight so why'd you wanna date?
Thought you had faith
Why you searching through my tapes?
Didn't you think that you were sorta bait?
How dare you, dare you, lie to my face…

[Hook: Abel Tesfaye aka Kin Kane]
You don't like chains
You rock these pearls
Step into my world
So the cameras on her
You don't like me
You broke this too
Money gets you in the mood

[Bridge: Abel Tesfaye aka Kin Kane]
She don't like rap, but I know she'll pop it
She don't like chains, but I know she'll rock it
She don't like fur, but I know she'll cop it
She don't like planes, but she rides the cockpit

[Verse 2: Abel Tesfaye aka Kin Kane]
God blow the pockets
And she'll never stop for my card to swipe it
And I bet her girlfriend love to talk shit
But they not used so they try to block it
Call me Listerine, cause I'm cleaning mouths with my bully team
But I — care your lips like I'm Vaseline
So I could be the real reason that you dream
So come join my team, cause no matter who comes you're my number one
No matter who stays you're my number one
The force [?] the whole world would stop…

[Hook: Abel Tesfaye aka Kin Kane]
You don't like chains
You rock these pearls
Step into my world
So the cameras on her
You don't like me
You broke this too
Money gets you in the mood
