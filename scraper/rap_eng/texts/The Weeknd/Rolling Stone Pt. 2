[Intro: The Weeknd]

[Verse 1: SuaVay Nova]
Girl I'm faded girl I'm fuckin' faded
I don't see two of you I see you naked
Too much smoke in here my focus gone
Misses flower bomb come get your lotus on

You just want the drugs I just want the high
I'm seeing all of your issues from the pain all in your eyes
I can get you through yo problems girl
This that up top but ill start off from the bottom girl

Say you love me I know you love me girl
Take this sip it slow tell me you love me girl
Dont judge me girl
I'm a keep sipping Texas til you touch me girl

Faded too long
Now I'm on this rolling stone
I just can't leave it alone
It feels too much like home girl
Love me til it's gone girl

[Hook: The Weeknd & SuaVay Nova]
Love me
They want that XO shit they want that XO shit
Before they all love me
They want that XO shit well I got that XO shit
That'll make you XO quick
Until you won't love me
They want that XO shit they want that XO shit
Before they all loved me
They want that XO shit well I got that XO shit
That'll make you XO quick
