[Harmonization]

[Intro & Hook]
Keep it on that XO
Nobody has to know
Keep it on that XO, only XO
I only want you to fuck with XO tonight

[Verse: 1]
You want me, but
He needs you
Yet your tellin' me that, everything's good
Tryna convince me, baby
To do as you say, just
Go along girl and
See things your way and

[Hook]
Keep it on that XO (oh baby)
Nobody has to know
Has to know, has to know (oh, oh)
Keep it on that XO (x7)
Nobody has to know
Has to know, has to know

[Verse: 2]
Didn't know you were down, for him finding out
I thought you had some kind of love, for your man
Well I'm not tryna break up something you been workin' on
But I get it, he tryna get it, that nigga ain't me
I wet it, don't forget it
You looking calm, since the last time I looked at you
It could have been, might of been a couple years
Well I'm not tryna break up something you been workin' on
But I get it, he tryna get it, that nigga ain't me
I wet it, don't forget it
We be all night....
