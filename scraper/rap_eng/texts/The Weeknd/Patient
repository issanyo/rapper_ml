[Verse 1]
Tell me where your style, where you know the life
Tell me how you fit, girl, you fit your time
I’m not tryna make you heed from light
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don’t wanna take, but I need to flow
Tell me how to let what you want to know
I know what to say for you believe in love
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
So much in the way now, all sleep
So much to weigh down, join me
If I could lay down, trust sleep
No one to lay down, I don’t sleep

[Interlude]
See baby, don’t worry, I said sorry
Don’t block me, oh baby, my baby
Control me, you want me

[Verse 2]
I don’t wanna say we could talk alot
I’m not tryna make it we can get in touch
I know what your sayin make enough from love
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
I don’t wanna solve what you love to do
And the way you talkin when i’m set to new
I’m just tryna leave it all to truth and you
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
So much in the way now, all sleep
So much to weigh down, join me
If I could lay down, trust sleep
No one to lay down, I don’t sleep

[Interlude]
See baby, don’t worry, I said sorry
Don’t block me, oh baby, my baby
Control me, you want me
