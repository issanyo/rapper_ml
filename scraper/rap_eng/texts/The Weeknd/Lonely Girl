[Intro: The Weeknd]
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go and have a lay ....

[Verse 1: DJ DX]
I brought you to my house, my home, your not alone
I remember when we use to stay up late on the phone
Texted back and forth you was in love with my voice
I cut studio time and wouldn't chill with my boys
You was a stripper from the Chi, but you loved Illinois
That was your ex, but he really couldn't make no noise
And you played with toys cause he couldn't make you scream
It was your dream by choice just to sleep with me
I made you moan and cry, lets get it on tonight
Before it gets crazy lets turn off the lights
Then mommy come ride me like a motor bike
I took off the condom cause the rubbers too tight
I wasn't using my mind, I was tipsy off the wine
But nine months later your hollering that its mine?
Many men grind before you met me
But you choose to go on TV to disrespect me: why ?

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)

[Verse 2: DJ DX]
I let you in my room and I see how you do
Now your left all alone and your calling me cruel?
Your son don't like you and your mother doesn't either
But you turn my fans against me and made them non believers
But I'm fighting through these industry scandals like Justin Bieber
I thought you were Selena, how could you betray me?
I thought you was mature but your not my type of lady
Its crazy how women can be so shady
But baby I'm strong and i learned from my wrongs
I put nothing but the truth into these songs
Life lives on even though the soul is torn
But I've been like this ever since i was born
And i made one wish but I'm stuck in the storm
But when we made love it felt so warm
It felt so right, it was just so raw
I knew one day you'll come begging for more
Ugh

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
(To let you in my)
To let you in my home
(Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
