[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Bitch I'm 6'5", I should play point guard for the Hawks
I'm a ghetto nigga, used to eat cereal with a fork
Used my t-shirt for a napkin, I was ratchet as fuck
Put that clean on the plate, watch 'em vacuum it up
Drop that Weeknd, she start backin' it up, alright!
Had a threesome in the back of the truck
Shawty say she ain't gay, but she curious
If you love me, tat my name on your uterus
Sippin' Easter pink, foreign cars for the whole team
Fuckin' with them lames, ma you fuckin' with the wrong team
Gutter like a bowlin' alley, even in the booth
I'm wearin' a Gucci jacket, Cartier lens, bracelet to match it
'Scuse me, pass the gasses, headband in the plastic
Like I'm a professor, I'm in my own classes
Turn the work to gymnastics, watch me flip the cash
On her, a shot of the D'usse, and a shot for her ass

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Look, this that barely sober, faded flow, no I might not make it home
Drunk textin' all my fuckin' exes, Cash'd take my phone
Man I love this shit, I'd never trade it for my soul
Swear I told Jimmy I might not make it to the show
No, no, no
In California with a vegan chick
She said the only meat she eat is dick
I had your girl on 10, but she gon' plead the fifth
You still think she a keeper, dog? Keep the bitch
XO in my bloodwork, whole squad livin' now
They could spot us anywhere, ape hair stickin' out
Wait, I pull up to the party with the Cali plug
You know I prolly brought the drugs when the shit's too strong

[Hook: The Weeknd]
The shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
First off, let me introduce myself, I'm Mr. Yayo
Condo and two freak bitches down in M-I-A-O
Done a video in the Bay, Mac Dre's house in Vallejo
I got hitters, dealers, tings and thug niggas on the payroll, yup!
You been poppin' molly, tryna come down, it's too late for that
Scratchin' on your body cause you itchin' where the drank is at
I've been had that ether cause my people manufacture that
Took a break and went to rap, but then I'm goin' right back to that
Gotti! I might not make it, I know it, I'm takin' a risk, my life simple
All I do is get money and fuck with bitches... hold up, hold up, hold up
All I do is pull up plugs and fuck up kitchens
Been on for too long, goin' three strong, four in the mornin'
I might not make it

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not
