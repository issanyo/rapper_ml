[Intro: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just 'cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'm tryna sink in some gin
I need, I need, I need, I need, I need
And all this Hennessy got niggas in here hatin' on me
On me, on me, on me
But if the neighbors know my name then, then I'm doin' somethin' right
And if their mamas know my name
And if their homies know my name then
Then I'm doing something right
And if their girlfriends know my name
And just 'cause she loves me, don't mean she understands
I don't give a damn, I'll make her fuck the band, ooh, yeah
I love the guitars
I already know, I've seen her at my show banging out XO all day
And her friend's a freak
She can't feel her throat, no, she can't feel her knees, oh
And I'm not tryna talk
And I'm not tryna walk
Just lift me out the club

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For 'bout a week, shootin' shower scenes
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rollin' blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new Skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my twelve gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mil'
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like poppin' pills
Keep a double cup, I like crackin' seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, 'bout to drink up
If you're talkin' 'bout money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend comin' home with me
And when she alone with me
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'ma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
Cause their pussy is the best and they head fire

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Juicy J]
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
[Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin']](1522567)
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
