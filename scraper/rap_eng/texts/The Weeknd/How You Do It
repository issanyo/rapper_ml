[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah
Ahhh, yeah
I know that your body is calling me
I'ma knock it out all night till the morning
And love it every time you be moaning, yeah
How you do it?
Girl show me how you do it
Oh, how you do it?
Show me how you do it
Show me

[Verse 1: Speed Gang]
Girl won't you show me how you do it
When you move your body like that, ayy
Girl won't you show me how you move it
When you bring that ass back, ayy
Move that body like a cyclone
God damn baby you fine too
Move that body like a cyclone
Sneak over tonight boo
When you ride it you moan all night
God damn baby how did you get so tight?
God damn baby how did you get so tight?
I'ma li-li-li-lick you all night
Rage in the cage and piss upon the stage
There's only one sure way to bring the giant down
Defunct the strings of cemetery things
One on one flat foot on the devils wing

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah
Ahhh, yeah
I know that your body is calling me
I'ma knock it out all night till the morning
And love it every time you be moaning, yeah
How you do it?
Girl show me how you do it
Oh, how you do it?
Show me how you do it
Show me

[Verse 2: Speed Gang]
Yeah I'm pretty sure I love you
Or I just don't want to be alone
But I like the way that pussy feels
And the way you moan
Baby girl what you doing later on?
Got the top 5 pussys in my phone
Baby girl you only number 4
But that's okay girl what you on?
Oh, oh, what's up doe?
Suck my dick then call your boo
Oh, oh, what's up doe?
Suck my dick then call your boo

[Pre-Chorus: Speed Gang]
These hoes ain't loyal, they never will
This love shit's a battle field
You let them in, they always steal
You look for safety but always...
These hoes ain't loyal, they never will
This love shit's a battle field
You let them in, they always steal
That's why I sold mine to the Devil, ohh

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah
Ahhh, yeah
I know that your body is calling me
I'ma knock it out all night till the morning
And love it every time you be moaning, yeah
How you do it?
Girl show me how you do it
Oh, how you do it?
Show me how you do it
Show me
