[Verse 1]
I love her, today
Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late
Now I need to know
If you're feeling when I'm free

[Hook]
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you calling? Oh, Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday

[Verse 2]
Girl I try, girl I try
I've been here for too long
Baby, don't cry
Why are you calling again?
But it's not Thursday, baby, why you calling?

[Hook]
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday Sunday, but on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you holding in, oh, on Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday

[Outro]
