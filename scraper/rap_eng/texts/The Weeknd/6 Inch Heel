[Instrumental Intro]

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
Then she killed the fucking stage like an enemy

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar
Work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
She tricking on herself she don't need a boss
(Don't you know) really ain't a thing to flaunt
(That two door) stunting with the ceilings on
Got these bitches in they feelings cause she paid it all
Used to have a man, wasn't meant to be
Made 100 bands, that's a century
Saving up for plans that would never be
She already made enough but she'll never leave

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
Falling from the sky, f-f-falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
All this money, money, falling from the sky
F-f-falling from the sky, falling from the sky

[Verse 3: Belly]
Got a 100 bands I don't need a reason
Tell these bitches it's killing season
200 cash, she don't need a visa
Money, money all she believin'
300 flat, bitch left me freezin'
Balling, balling you play the bleachers
400 down, primp on the beach
Comin' round and everything on fleek

[Chorus: Belly]
Six inch heel, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She worked for the money, she worked for the money
From the start to the finish
And she's worth every dollar, worth every dollar
But she's worth every minute

[Outro]
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
She work for the money
But she's worth every minute
