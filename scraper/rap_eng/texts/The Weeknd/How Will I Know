[Verse 1]
Feeling somebody
Cold when you're numb
I'm with somebody
How will I know
How will I know, yeah
How will I, how will I know if I don't know
Standing tall
How will I know, how will I know
How will I know, how will I make you love
How will I know

[Verse 2]
Tell me we're faded, you know
Faded to toe, I'm making a toast
Rollin' and spinnin' a jay, rollin' and pour one
I'm makin' a toast, standin' my body
And tote, I'm making you boat
Holding your body to say how will I know
How will I know, yeah, how will I know
No, well I don't, well I don't, well I don't, will I know
How will I know, how will I know
How will I know 'bout your time all alone
How will I know, how will I know
How will I know
