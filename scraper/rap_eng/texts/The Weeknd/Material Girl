[Verse 1]
I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do

[Hook]
Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

[Verse 2]
Super star undercover
You're my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert
Baby you're my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream
Lady, you're the one that I want to spend my cash on
Spend my cash on my baby like
Baby, just make sure that you'll always put your man on

[Hook]
You gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

[Verse 3]
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste
Baby girl, give me more
Baby take the keys to my ride, to my home
Girl, I'mma make it rain like a tropical storm
Tripping over you like a crack on the floor
Can't settle with a taste
Baby girl, give me more
Baby take the keys to my ride, to my home
Girl, I'mma make it rain like a tropical storm

[Hook]
Ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
Ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets
Material girl, anything you need
And I'mma give it to you, to you
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all
