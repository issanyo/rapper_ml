[Intro]
Come on this exodus

[Verse 1]
Do you want to come on this exodus?
If you got swag, fuck with us
And do you wanna ride like a crusader?
You ain't gotta Christian Dior (christ endour)
My blood type is no negative
But I'm positive that I'm too deep
Switch the light on when we hit the sheets
Truly what I see is all I keep
I see you stacked chicks their views are blocked in
When I help 'em you say broke in
I see you locked in you say I don't let you in
How come all this drama's still trending

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for

[Verse 2]
New frontier I got news from there
Let's sail it to a new frequency
I left the graveyard selling full of fancy
Bring your homie with transparency
My blood type is no negative
But I'm positive the dark ain't deep
Just switch your light on when we hit the streets
Truly what I see is all I keep
My sights are set in higher times
And my eyes can see in 3D
Make it bright and I see 360
I can get you, but you can't get me

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for



[Chorus 2]
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for

[Verse 3]
Cash and Kashmir, gold in Zaier
I got a new want from over there
You can drink a mint tea by the Red Sea
As you're living out whose fantasy
Yeah the sun the moon are both
Hitting the hood and the heat's too hot to be cool
Yeah I'm sailing my bed to a better man school
And it's two in the afternoon
We already bullet-proof we got a big crew
And we're running on a force that's true
We don't fear you wear up-to-date shoes
Or fall for the point of view

[Chorus]
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for
Baby you can have it all
Tell me what for


[Chorus 2]
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for
Yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all
Tell me what for

[Outro]
What d'you want it all for?
What d'you want it all for?
