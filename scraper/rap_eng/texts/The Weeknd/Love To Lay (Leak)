[Intro]
You know I'm already here
Wherever you are baby
For you, for you, for you

[Hook]
I don't hold it with you, you sleeping on me
Get to the watch and get fiending on me
Get up, turn me in, save the whole night
I don't need you with you won't text me morning
Can't tell me what you did
Tell me what you wanted but did he go nasty or nah
Why do I do this here?
Why do I do this here?
Why do I hold it on tight?
How do I show you what's good?
How do I put my lips into your skin?
How do I tell you what to do?
How do I tell you where it's going?
How do I order us the same?
How will I know?

[Bridge]
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
Secret
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see

[Hook]
I don't hold it with you, you sleeping on me
Get to the watch and get fiending on me
Get up, turn me in, save the whole night
I don't need you with you won't text me morning
Can't tell me what you did
Tell me what you wanted but did he go nasty or nah
Why do I do this here?
Why do I do this here?
Why do I hold it on tight?

How do I tell you where it's going?
How do I order us the same?
How will I know?
