[Verse 1]
Now she's here
Now she's here and you are gone, oh yeah
You've been gone and I've been showing all your moves to her
I've been using all your moves, oh yeah
So thank you, oh yeah
I'ma thank you that you left me
Baby, I'ma thank that you helped me be the best to her
I'ma be the best, oh yeah

[Chorus]
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God (to her)
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God (to her)
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be...

[Verse 2]
Now she ringing up my phone, ayy
Begging me for more
And she telling all her friends
'bout these nights that never end, never end, oh yeah
But there's enough to pass around, you don't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work, you don't gotta check the time
Baby, baby
And if you wanna last long, baby take another line
You ain't gotta feel the shame, girl we do it all the time
Baby, oh yeah, so...

[Chorus]
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God (to her)
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God (to her)
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be God
And I'ma be God, and I'ma be...

[Outro]
I'ma take the credit, oh
Oh watch me take the credit
All from you
Watch me take your credit
Baby, baby, baby
