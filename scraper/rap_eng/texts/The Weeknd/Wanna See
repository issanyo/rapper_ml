[Intro]
You know I'm already here
Wherever you are baby
For you, for you, for you

[Verse]
I don't hold it with you, you sleeping on me
Get to the watch and get fiending on me
Get up, turn me in, save the whole night
I don't need you with you won't text me morning
Can't tell me what you did
Tell me what you wanted but did he go nasty or nah
Why do I do this here?
Why do I do this here?
Why do I hold it on tight?
How do I show you what's good?
How do I put my lips into your skin?
How do I tell you what to do?
How do I tell you where it's going?
How do I order us the same?
How will I know?

[Hook]
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
Secret
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see

[Verse]
How do i hold your legs and you singing now
You can't tell me you what you did
Faded now
Again you tell me again
You tell me You want love
And i Don’t even watch you you gangsta mama
You can't tell me what you did half the time
Again run amuck
As long as you know
Why do you stay
Why do you scheme
How do I hold it this way
How do i show you what’s good
How do I to get your mates again
How do i tell you i fucked your friend
How do i tell you where it’s been
How do i always know what to say

[Hook]
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
Secret
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
Secret
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
Secret
I know what you want
I know, I know what you want to see
