[Intro]
Lonely-lone, lonely-lone
Lonely-lone, lonely-lone

[Verse 1]
I got somethin' to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing
Girl I've been bad again
Girl I've been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em, when I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I get up

[Chorus]
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down

[Verse 2]
Things you say
I know you want to do
Baby you know....
You don't know this, only doing this for me
....
But you especially

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I get up

[Chorus]
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down

[Bridge]
Watashi o okorasenaide hoshii
Konoyo na koto o sareruno wa fukainano
Watashi no kako o shitte, nando mo watashi no naka ni haittekuru
Watashi no kotae nado shitteiru hazu nanoni
Watashi ga something to tsumi wo kasanete kita koto o, anata wa shitte inai no

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I get up

[Chorus]
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
I always want you when I'm comin' down
