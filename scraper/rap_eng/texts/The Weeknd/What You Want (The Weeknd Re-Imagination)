[Intro]
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close
There, now hold me close

[Verse 1]
Knowing that he kissed you
Oh, damn, I can't believe you
I can't believe you took it there
Did he run his fingers through your hair?
Did he sing to you like this?
Why'd you let him steal that kiss?

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you loved me, girl
I'm on my knees
I thought no one could stop us
I thought no one could stop us
And I forgive you girl for what you did
Let me handle this, babe
Go on, tell me his name

[Chorus]
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need

[Verse 2]
Forgot everything you promised me
Forgot everything that you texted me
You ride around town but you didn't saw me and
Never would've thought you'd cheat on me
You're like nah, nah, nah, nah
I'm like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're doing things I never thought you'd do
October leaves are changing like they do
Girl, all these girls are calling up my room
And one of them was you
And now it's one a.m., girl
Damn, I need to cool off

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought you loved me, girl
I'm on my knees
I thought no one could stop us
I thought no one could stop us
And I forgive you, girl, for what you did
Lemme handle this, babe
Go on, tell me his name

[Chorus]
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
He's what you want, he's what you want
He's what you want, he's what you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I like this right here
