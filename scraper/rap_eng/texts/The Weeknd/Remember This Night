Verse 1:
It's that smile, tired, sleepy eyed
Kissing in the morning light
It's that style, wild
So inspired to never miss another night
You're a firework ligtin' up that night sky
You paint a picture in my memory like Fourth of July
Your love is gettin' me high
Every single day from here out
Remember tonight night, let's go

Pre-Chorus:
I've never felt like this before
And I'm begging you for more

Chorus:
I'll remember this night for the rest of my life
I'll remember this dance walking the line of a new romance
I'll remember this high I'm just feeling your fire
Lighting up the sky so bright
I'll remember this night for the rest of my life

Verse 2:
It's that walk back down the beach
It's the ocean at our feet
It's your name half in the sand before it's just a memory

Pre-Chorus:
And I want you so much more
What are we waiting for?

Chorus:
'Cause I'll remember this night for the rest of my life
I'll remember this dance walking the line of a new romance
I'll remember this high from just feeling your fire
Lighting up the sky so bright, I'll remember this night for the rest of my life

Outro 1:
As I smile, tired, sleepy eyed, kissing in the morning light
'Cause I'll remember this night for the rest of my life
I'll remember this dance walking the line of a new romance
I'll remember this night for the rest of my life

{Interlude}

Outro 2:
I'll remember this night for the rest of my life
I'll remember this dance walking the line of a new romance
I'll remember this high from just feeling your fire
Lighting up the sky so bright, I'll remember this night for the rest of my life
