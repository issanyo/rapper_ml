[Intro: The Weeknd, Young Thug & A$AP Rocky]
Know me, know me
Ho-ohh-ohh-oh
Know me, know me
Oh, na-na-na-na-na
Know me, know me
Woah-woah-oh-oh
Know me, know me (uh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio (radio)
Growin' up, my folk was on, ain't have to kick a door (kick a door)
Keep sixty bitches backstage, at like every show (every show)
Ainâ€™t no more Hanes on my balls, these are Kenneth Cole (Cole)
All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin' those (those)
Let lil' shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on (on)
Everybody 'round me poppin, bitch, we kettle corn (kettle corn)
Fly the PJ on the e-way with the P1
Karat and a half drippin' on my neck, son
(ho-ohh-ohh-oh)
Take a bubble bath with a rapper's baby mama
(oh, na-na-na-na-na)
Young dirty nigga rockin' water like a swamp
(woah-woah-oh-oh)
Yeah, I just fucked her last night, didn't tell her my name
(na-na-na-na-na-na)
All these hip-hop rappers down to be Drake (na-na)
All my double cups purple like the soul plane (na-na-na-na-na)
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent (hoo-aye)
Got her bouncin' on this dick like hydraulics

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause you know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low, mane

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
You know me, you know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, young, young nigga, same OG, stayin' low-key
Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces
G says, made a thesis, I'm a G
I'm a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix...
I beg your pardon? It's true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
Assumin' it influenced, all a sudden, change of heart
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
'Mind 'em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith, I'd prolly walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the whip around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause you know me, you know me
You know me, you know me
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me (pow! pow!), you know me
