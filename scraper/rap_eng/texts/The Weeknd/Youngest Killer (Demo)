Eh, I'm just trying to deal with what you feel, with what you  (?)
Faded off and knows keeps em keeling (?)
Oh I really know I gotta (?) while you (?)
I've been getting time, well you know I got a whole shit
All my niggas ballin', screamin' where the fuck we goin'
Killing with your (?) what you saw, I'll make them [?]
I've been making [?]
Tell me [?]

I know it will be a long (?)
I know something you don't know, eh
I'm here to take you (?)
Tell me that you do it I don't mean

Oh, I've been in love
While I want everybody to see through love
Oh, thank you all the time
Take me through the night
XO

I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a dozen cups of different colored potions
All I wanna do is get that money and make dope shit
Niggas they recruiting always sounding like my old shit
Everybody knows it, all you nigga know me
[?]
Faded off of codeine, rolling till my nose bleed
Hitting off of nothing while I blow through that OG

I know it will be a long (?)
I know something you don't know, eh
I'm here to take you (?)
Tell me that you do it I don't mean

Oh, I've been in love
While I want everybody to see through love
Oh, thank you all the time
Take me through the night
XO
