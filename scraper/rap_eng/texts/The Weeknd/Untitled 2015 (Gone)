[Intro]
I'm gone...
I'm gone...
I'm gone...
I'm gone...

[Verse 1]
We don't need your love, no more
Said I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
You don't need to talk, no more
Cause these kids already know
Now these kids already know
Said I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need your love
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to walk around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes up out those outfits
Now we get faded while we walking with a joystick
They don't wanna -

[Verse 2]
Used to roam on queen now I sing queen street anthems
Used to hate attention now I pull up in that wagon
