[Verse 1]
It won't be in vain
To swallow all your pain
And learn to love what burns
And gather courage to return to

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 2]
The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Verse 3]
They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

[Hook]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
