[Intro]
The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

[Verse 1]
I know you want your money, girl
Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
What nobody ever could

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

[Verse 2]
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment till my time is done
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
What nobody ever could

[Chorus]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)
Cause you belong to the world (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (oh babe, I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)
But you belong to the world (Oh baby)

[Bridge]
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream

[Hook]
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

[Outro]
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
