[Intro]
Why would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us
There's always been the things you said
But no relation
You choose to be distant
No one's gonna know that you miss him, it's too late I don't feel love
And to move
And the reason you do
Even though the baby is mine, you will never win my love, no
You will never win my love, no. No
Even if the baby is mine, you will never win my love, no
You will never win my... love, no
Even if she needs my love, you'll never be sure. No
Oh no, not in love, not in love. No
You would seem real lonely
No reason. Oh
No reason, no
Even if the baby is mine, you will never win my love, no
You will never get my love, no
No, everything you worked on for love, you will never get my love, no
You will never get my love, no, no, no, no baby
