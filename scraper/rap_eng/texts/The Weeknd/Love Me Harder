Tell me something I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Baby, love me harder

Love me, love me, love me

Harder, harder, harder

I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder
Love me, love me, love me
Harder, harder, harder

So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again, yeah
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again

'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
(love me harder)
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder
(love me harder)

Love me, love me, love me

Harder, harder, harder

Love me, love me, love me

Harder, harder, harder
