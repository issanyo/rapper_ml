[Verse]
Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So, let's just try to end it with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear that you are suffering
You are suffering no more
'Cause I held you down when you were suffering
You were suffering

[Chorus]
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

[Bridge]
And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
But I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna hear that no more, no more
No more, no more
I don't wanna hear that no more
