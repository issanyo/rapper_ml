[Chorus]
Ohh, Why do you know
You Know, You Guys
You Know, You Guys
You Know
You Guys

[Verse 1]
You Know, Everyone of you want to take anything
You won't know this thing that I always do
You took my energy because I don't know what to do
I don't know any whatever what i look

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
You hold my energy, Why?
I don't care about you will harder than a radio
Ohh, Ohh, Too Late, Too Late
Oh, Why you were?

[Bridge]
You were my friends
You were my love
I don't even think
You were my only darling

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You Know, You Guys
