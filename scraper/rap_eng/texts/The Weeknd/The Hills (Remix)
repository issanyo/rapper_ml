[Verse 1]
I was your boyfriend
Then you wanna go off and date him
That little vegan your pleading for forgiveness
This won't make me forget this
Your just reckless ill make you neckless
You'd be cryin
Cause you'd the one who be lying
You cheated I caught you red handed
Your defeated this relationship is evicted
Its restricted I guess we're addicted
To this wickedness this is my express to this mess

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
