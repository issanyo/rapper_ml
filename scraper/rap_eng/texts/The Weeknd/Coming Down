[Intro]
All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone

[Verse 1]
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'mma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl I been bad again, girl I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

[Pre-Hook]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

[Hook]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down

[Verse 2]
Poppin again, I tried to quit again
I'm always tight with something I begin
That's why my niggas got me to the end
Supply what I take, I take what I spend baby
I ain't lied to nobody but me
And you, and me
But you especially

[Pre-Hook]
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

[Hook]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down

[Bridge]

[Pre-Hook]
Pick up your phone
I'm all alone

[Hook]
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
