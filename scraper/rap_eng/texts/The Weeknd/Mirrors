[Verse 1]
Bad intentions you bring
No religion that you follow
Still you bullshit for boys in love
You're so blind to see that enough is enough
I don't concern myself too much
I'll awake when my time is arrived
When all is said and done
Tonight well
I can't feel my heart
Cause you leach off to many hearts
Well it's safe to say
That I've had enough of troubled thoughts in my mind
I should try to pray for my demise, ohhh-ohh

[Hook]
What's the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you see in this mirror that you're lookin', baby
You're so ashamed, I see it in the look in your eyes
You're afraid, I wanna show you what's inside of you
Let me enter your brain now
Pardon me, I only see your reflection, but you
Best believe this is a fuckin' test of
What you do, oh you know what you do
I'ma let you solve your own clues
Baby the hardest part is the will to come in
I know you lost respect for me
Say that you did
Could you give me one last kiss
So I could learn to feel again
Make me regret everything that I've done
And love again, love again

[Hook]
What's the point of wasting love on you?
Your indecisive choices lead you here
I walk with a dead and frozen heart
Decide to restrain from attaining scars
Neither of us admit to our faults
Which led to our fall

[Outro]
Why don't you run away, run away from him
And come running to me when you're on your knees
Cause I will give the right solution
I can do is love you one last time
Just to recollect memories in our mind
When everything is done don't act like you know me so well
I'll just be someone that you used to know
