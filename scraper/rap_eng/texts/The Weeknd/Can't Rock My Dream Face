[Dreams Verse 1]
Now here you go again, you say
We want your freedom
Well who am I to keep you down
It's only right that you should
Play the way you're feelin'
But listen carefully to the sound
Dreams of loneliness

[Dreams Pre-Chorus (Rock with You Hook)]
Like a heartbeat (Feel that heat)
Drives you mad
In the stillness (Feel that beat)
Of remembering
Of what you had (Feel that heat)
And what you lost (Share that beat of love)
And what you had (Feel that beat)
And what you lost (Share that beat of love)

[Dreams Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Can't Feel My Face Verse 1/Verse 2]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know (this I know)
Girl, I know

[Can't Feel My Face Pre-Chorus (Rock with You Hook)]
She told me don't worry (Feel that heat)
About it
She told me don't worry (Feel that beat)
No more
We both know we can't go (Feel that heat)
Without it
She'll told me you'll never (Share that beat of love)
Be alone, ooh

[Can't Feel My Face Chorus]
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it (but I love it), but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it (but I love it) , but I love it (yes I love it), oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it (but I love it), but I love it (yes I love it)
