Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, nananana

I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really gonna sleep at all
You ain't gon' catch me with them sneak pictures, sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

She asked me if I do this every day, I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often
Do it how I want it
Do it how I want it
Often
Do it how I want it

She asked me if I do this every day, I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often
Do it how I want it
Often
Do it how I want it
Do it how I want it

She asked me if I do this every day, I said often
Asked how many times she rode the wave, not so often
Bitches down to do it either way, often

Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it

Do it how I want it
Do it how I want it
