[Intro]

[Verse 1: Cash Nelly]
My line stay trickin
This money I'm flipping
Finessin and flexing
Like I was a gymnast
Mixen the drugs
And we blow shit like chemists
You niggas Don't add up
You can't get the difference
Im plotting
And wheelin and dealin
You serpent
You think that yall real
But y'all niggas just peelin
We villains
Pop n we kill em
Massaging ass niggas
You hear this you feel it
I been the realist
My lo cap the tealist
I got more connects a humanoid helix
Pimpin them phones
And hacking them codes
Not Da Vinci my nigga
Still talking them phones
Just a hit a lick on a box with phone and I
Gave it too logod
Just for a lo
Still getting pros
Man S/o too my foes
Dem niggas just mad cause we ain't chasing hoes
Flex on a boat
Driving too private islands
Witta house on the beach
Is my life assignment
I'm chopping them bricks of dat audio dope
Then bring out the loads
On da fucking streets doe
Im brain washing niggas
Like I was the pope
You niggas try this bet yo lungs gone get smoked
I been trippin hard
Still waiting on Zae too get that card
Bitchhhhh

[Hook: The Weekend 2X]
Break it, drop it, drink it spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
Gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it baby
Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
Cause I've been gone
