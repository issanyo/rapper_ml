Baby...
Baby...

Wake Up
Wake Up
Wake Up
Wake up

Please, mercy me
Let me fall out of love, before you fuck her
I beg you
I'll give you all my pills
I'll give you all that I need
Baby...
I see that she is beautiful
The most beautiful by far
I see that she makes you feel good 'bout who you are
But you see how much I need you?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?

I've been spendin all my time, livin for the thrill
All this money that I've thrown, all this liquor that I've spilled
I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is﻿ all I know
Inspiration is all I have
So I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress


What do I do now that you're gone?
What do I do when I'm alone?
You've been running in my head..
What do I do when﻿ I need sex?
You're my everything...
You're my heart..
You're my everything...
You're my heart

Ouu, I thought I told you, a long time ago
Don't you fall in love..
Don't make me make you fall in love...
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me..
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me...
Like me...
