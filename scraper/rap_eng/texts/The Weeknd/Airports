I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet, I'll get on it after former
More sections of this yak on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll, but I fuckin' roll
Feelin' like a million bucks before
I walk through this door, when I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it, but I made it, that's for sure
For sure, your lovin', I need more, I need yours

She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what I'm sippin' on
They don't want my love, they just want my potential
Fuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this
Got me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss
Give me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist

And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
