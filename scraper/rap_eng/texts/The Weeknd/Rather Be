[Verse 1]
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exulted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

[Pre-Chorus]
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

[Chorus]
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

[Verse 2]
Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring the drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring you fame
I got my heart right here

[Hook]
Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself
Listen, ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself

[Chorus]
If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
Cause when I am with you
