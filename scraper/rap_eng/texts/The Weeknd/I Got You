[The Weeknd]
Now you thinking bout it, girl you thinking bout it
What we got here, how we fucking got here
And recognize, and just recognize
I’m in a life without a home so this recognition’s not enough

[Aasim]
Broken promises, this frigid love got cold sheets
You had your blinders on, couldn’t see past all this gold leaf
Waterfront views, the city’s lit me on the 16’s floor
We could see helicopter pilots
Anytime we look out the front door
First night of passion, first night I met you
Infatuation, thought you was special
Asked for your number, kinda nervous to text you
But on the second night, it was dead for right
And the privilege to sex you

[Aasim]
Dinner by candle light, liquor by the case
I just cooked for you but I’m dying to really know how you taste
Now what’s in the cars, cause we both feel like this is dope
And I’ma snort you up, either till I’m high or a nigga overdose
I just left baby moms, you just left oh boy
All we do is have sex, and no way I’m annoyed
I lay back and enjoy, I feel I’m on another level
I feel I might love you, oh shit, I think I’m in trouble

[The Weeknd]
You love me, whoa
For that all you love me
Until you wanna love me, oho
Cause I’m all love

[Aasim]
I’ve touring, I’ve been houring, I’ve been rolling stoning
I’ve been servicing your body and that’s really important
So can’t nothing break us, put no one before you
Be a apart of greatness, such an honor to know you
We might walk that out, I might cop that ring
I might get on one knee, the central park while weekend sings
I’am hold you down, baby down would you hold me back
And if you do I’ma hold you forever
And can’t nothing in the world top that

[The Weeknd]
Baby I love you, I got you, I got you
But I still got you
And I got you
