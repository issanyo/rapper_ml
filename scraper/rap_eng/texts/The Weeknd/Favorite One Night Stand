[The Weeknd: Verse 1 (rapping)]
Can'ts and Do's
Sun rays in my rays
Sweatin' to my feet
Sippin on lean'
On the beach passin' other Bs
Still got my two con, color of Poupon
Baggy jean nigga
Got me raggin' like UConn
And the strippers no fruit, God
All my niggas
Celebrate with grey goose
With my Billy Mays crew
Cus we clean so smoove
We revved with tattoos
And some bitches so goose
Sayin' how they want it
Then they take us to they rooms
In they birthday suit
Take it all off
I dont wanna see you baby in those draws
We can make a movie (ohh)
We can rate it R
I can bring the camera
Baby you can be the star
Done
Follow the sound of Onra
Back to the party
Don't crash the car
We back to the jam
Back back to the jam
Our summer things comin'
Baby put away the cam
Our summer things comin'
She my number one fan
I never give a damn
But her ass too slamin'
And I just wanna hit it til' the snow hits the floor
Oh yeaa
Soakin' ova' before hand
You are my favorite one night stand
My favorite one night stand
You are my favorite one night stand
My favorite one night stand (ohh)
You are my favorite one night stand

..Talk to me baby, talk to me

The Weeknd [Singing]
Ohh Ohh
Ohh Ohh
Ohh Ohh
Ohhhh Ohh
