[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I'll make it look so easy
Girl it's so easy, so easy, so easy
Do what I do, it's easy
Girl it's so easy, so easy, so easy

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm not trying to talk at all
Cause I’m tryna' love you crazy
I'm tryna' love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
Drink 'till you numb the pain

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I got them touching on they body
These girls keep touching on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous
I got 'em thinking that they want me
Although they know they're not the only
I got them wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I'll give it up so easy
Girl I'm too easy, too easy, too easy
I'ma fall in love until they leave me
Cause they gon' leave me, gon' leave me, gon' leave me

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm not trying to talk at all
Cause I’m tryna' love you crazy
I'm tryna' love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'till you numb the pain

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I got them touching on they body
These girls keep touching on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous
I got 'em thinking that they want me
Although they know they're not the only
I got them wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
I'm not trying to talk at all
Cause I’m tryna' love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'till you numb the pain

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I got them touching on they body
These girls keep touching on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous

Although they know they're not the only
I got them wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in, the 90s' are dangerous
