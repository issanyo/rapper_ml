[Verse 1]
And now I know relationship's my enemy
So stay away from me
I'm warning you
You try to fill the void with every man you meet
'Cause you're upset with me
I'm warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life
'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you

[Verse 2]
When you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me
Just call me up again
I'll make you weak
Girl, I'll come to put myself between your legs
Not between your heart
Can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
That all the nights you slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)
And all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)
If it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)
But if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna hurt you (ooh)
I don't wanna hurt you

[Outro]
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't wanna, baby
I don't wanna, baby
I don't, ooh
