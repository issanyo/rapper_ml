[Verse 1]
Feeling somebody
Cold when you're numb
My weakness somebody
How will I know?

[Chorus]
How will I know? yeah
How will I
How will I know if I don't look
Spending time
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I Iove to love you
How will I make you love me?
How will I know?

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what did you know?
Didn't you tell I make enough to
Rolling and spinning the taste you rolling a pour i'm making you too
Seeing my body on tour, while making you poke
I'm making you look
Holding your body the same
How will I know

[Chorus]
How will I know? yeah
How will I know?
Know that I don't
But I don't, when it's on
Girl I know
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know but you come all alone?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I

Cool
