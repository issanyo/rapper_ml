[Intro]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognized
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough
I don't care about nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long, too long, too long
Baby, I've been on this too long

[Verse 2]
'Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotonin
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah, I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'ma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note

[Chorus]
Ooh, but until then
I got you, ooh
Baby, I got you, ooh
Until you're used to my face
And my mystery fades
I got you, ooh

[Verse 3]
So, baby, love me, oh
Before they all love me
Until you won't love me, oh
Because they'll all love me, ooh
I'll be different, oh
I think I'll be different, ooh
I hope I'm not different, oh
And I hope you'll still listen

[Chorus]
But until then
Baby, I got you, ooh
I got you, oh, ohh
Girl, I still got you, oh-ohh
And I got you, ooh, woah
