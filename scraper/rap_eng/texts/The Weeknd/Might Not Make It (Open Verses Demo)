[Pre-Chorus]
I be getting fucked up
I been gettin' hoes
Spending like a low life

[Chorus]
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not, I might not make it
I might not make it

[Pre-Chorus]
We all gettin' fucked up
I been making love to her
I been making something

[Chorus]
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it

[Pre-Chorus]
We all gettin' fucked up
I been making love to her
I been making something

[Chorus]
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it easy, I might not make it
I might not make it, this time I might not

[Verse 1]
Everybody 'round me is smoking superfantastic
I can make your girl disappear like magic
All I gotta do is follow where the bass is
Smoke a little weed really nothin too drastic
Smoking at the bus stop
Smoking in the bus still
In the room, in the bathroom
When the L's up pass it
Ain't nobody really doing X'O damage
Gotta couple pornstars shootin on the mattress
Listening to House of Balloons like a classic
I've been real done, why you passing
I've been stoned in the middle of the backseat
Got my nigga  Lamar
Shout out my nigga [?]
I've been feeling low
Watch your peak, yeah you passed it
I been making [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
We all gettin' fucked up
I been making nothin'
I been making something

[Chorus]
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not, I might not make it
I might not make it, this time I might not
