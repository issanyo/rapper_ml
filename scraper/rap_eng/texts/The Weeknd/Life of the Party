[Verse 1]
Hello, welcome to the other side
You're lost
Baby step outside your mind
You've been really good
You've been really good
You've been thinking bout being bad ever since I put you on
She got money for blow
Just check her damn nose
Prescription ain't an issue
You can mix it with the oh
And if you wanna do it, baby
I'm right here with you
I'm on cloud nine
Baby you're behind
You can follow me
You can follow me if you want

[Hook]
To go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step you’re the life of the party
Know that step you’re the life of the party

[Verse 2]
I got two little ladies
I got one little room
There's a room full of liquor
Baby what you wanna do?
The way you move got me feeling so uhh
I been thinking about it baby
I been thinking about it lately
I'm so far gone and you are too

[Hook]
Show me how you go downtown
With the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party

[Verse 3]
I love how you touch
How you feel
How you breathe
Baby how you do it so good?
How you twist with your hips got the room so small baby
And girl please don't go
You're gonna please my boys
You been thinking about it baby
Yeah you're a star
Oh you knocked one down
Girl you knocked it down
Girl, there's one, two, three

[Hook]
Go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step you’re the life of the party
Know that step you’re the life of the party
