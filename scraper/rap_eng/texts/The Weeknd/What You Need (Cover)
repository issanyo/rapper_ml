[Verse 1]
I just wanna take you there
He don't gotta go nowhere
Does he touch you here like this, this, this, this
Let me get some friction on your lips

[Pre Chorus]
And I will love you girl the way you need
And no one's gon' stop us
And no one's gon' stop us
And I will give you girl
For what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins
Just fight through the pain

[Chorus]
He's want you want, he's want you want
He's want you want, he's want you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
He's want you want, he's want you want
He's want you want, he's want you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need

[Verse 2]
I got everything you want from me
I do everything he does times 3
And he don't gotta know
I got you on the floor
Doing things you never thought you do
Baby leave your high heel shoes
Cuz I love the way your looking down at me
And I'm looking up at you
And I don't give a damn shawty watch me knock your boots off

[Pre Chorus]
And I will love you girl
The way you need
And no one's gon' stop us
And no one's gon' stop us
And I will give you girl
For what you fiend
I'm the drug in your veins
Just fight through the pain

[Chorus]
He's want you want, he's want you want
He's want you want, he's want you want
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
I'm what you need, what you need, what you need
He's want you want, he's want you want
He's want you want, he's want you want
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
I'm what you need, I'm what you need
