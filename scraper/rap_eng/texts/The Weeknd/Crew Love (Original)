[Verse 1]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2]
If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city
Need proof, ask your girl's titties, she on the right side
SSL on the left, saying we the best
She wants to be friends with the crew
Take a lot of pics and travel where we move
Model on stage while I'm singing in her ear
20,000 fans get jealous up in here
They don't even care, girl, give it a rest
Ain't no fucking pussy gonna stick out from the rest
Girls with big breasts ain't shit without leg
'Least in my books so put me through this test, I could care less
Penelope Cruz, Natalie Portman, please holla at your dude
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Used to rap blues for the girls with tattoos
Don't you forget it, girls like Gia, girls with no visas
Addicted to the life, french girls named Mia
Cause my chick might be the next Keira Knightley
So baby, you can talk if you want, talk if you want
Talk if you want, talk if you want

They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
