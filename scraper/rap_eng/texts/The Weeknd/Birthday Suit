[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Here's your special cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Watch me throw it in the air
Pocket full of ones with the zeros in a pair
Find myself starin' at your waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist, waist
On my Superman shit, x-ray visions while you shakin' those hips (shakin' that shit)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I just wanna see you in your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin girl, before we begin

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Baby it's your special day, day, day, day, day, day, day
You already know, paddlin' a boat way I make your river flow
Baby you gonna make me take a break
Oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe, oh babe
Back at it again, money ain't a thang, baby I made it to spend
So just get

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin girl, before we begin

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Girl take off your outfit, call my place a dressing room
I be on that pussy but before my mind's undressing you
My stride Martin Luther with the brain like Luthor
Kryptonite in my pants, so her head go super
Ya man do you wrong, like he printed out a typo
Your body so crack should be whiter than albino
Your body so crack got me horny like a rhino
Shit, I know you seen wood like pine glow
Trust me when I say I'll keep you sacred like Chi Lo
Trust me when I say I'll satisfy you till the night go
Girl you already know the best damn part is
Get you on your back wax you like Kelly Clarkson
Officers bad girl, you're so wanted
To be honest, got a rocket in my pocket
Won't you want it baby, I just want you on it, babe, oh whoa

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I just wanna see you in your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin, girl before we begin
In your birthday suit
Take it all off, I don’t wanna see you baby in those draws
In your birthday suit, don't be scared
Kissin' on your skin girl, before we begin
