[Verse 1]
I want to save time, tonight
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I have words to say, fuck my life
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I know to say, do you know
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I won't say to her [?]
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down

[Hook]
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(Did you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

[Verse 2]
I made you so fuck you, no, no, no, no
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I know we torch you, no, no, no, no
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I know this ain't love, no, no, no, no
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I made so much, tonight
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down
I've been 'round smoking loud to get down

[Chorus]
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(Did you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

[Verse 3]
Dont want sleep now
I shoulda loved her
They want me to talk
A young woman just run past [?]
Stix my nigga say
"dont want you to cheat no?"
I have one minute more she won't shy away
I'm running sober like she [?]
I'll make you say it while shes scared from a burnt throat
I'll make you stand while she get it from ya man low
I'll make you feel it like she get it started by long
One shot, she roll, we know she feeling number
I'm 'fraid too long ill make your pants flowin
Pull out that E-systoma [?] ill make your pantie low
Ill make your state of mind. Ill make you wanna go
I puts a skin on when i flip out, when I H'd over
They don't get low when i get low and flinched over [?]
But i roll out in this H-throw
And i hope that you ain't that i knowing her
I really gotta take this beat now

[Chorus]
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no more, no more
I don't sleep no, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(Did you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(I said do you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't sleep no more, no more

I don't sleep no, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
(Did you?) I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
