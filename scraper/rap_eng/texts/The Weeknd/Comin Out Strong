High Klassified な音楽
I got the truth in me, baby!

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 2: Future]
I might end up with your ho if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
The only time I feel alive when I take (still comin')
I want a Vic but I know it ain't safe
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? (never say my name)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (no videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Verse 3: Future]
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't never answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (la familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(so familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Future]
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong

[Outro: The Weeknd & Future]
Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, she lie
Kindness, oh
