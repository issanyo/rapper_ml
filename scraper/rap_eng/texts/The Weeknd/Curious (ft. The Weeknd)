[Verse 1]
My lifestyle, I know you hate it
But for you , I'll go to changes
Take my life and re-arrange it
Put it all in different places

[Chorus]
We can cover all the bases
Bring you way back to the basics
'cause you deserve to feel my love
If you let me I could show you some
If you let me I could..
Think you know how this is
So you run from it
I guess it all depends
What you want from it?
Have you been here before?
And you put it on my name
You assume that I'm the same
These are women I can never love or claim
I'll admit, I've been curious , I've been curious

[Verse 2]
And I don't know what to do
Is it me or is it you?
I can tell you if you wanna know the truth
I'll admit, I've been curious , I've been curious
What are we comtemplatin'?
Pass when things get complicated
There's no time to be hesitatin'
You and I are losing patience

[Chorus]
We can cover all the bases
And I deserve to feel you naked
And you deserve to feel my love
If you let me I could show you some
If you let me I could..
Think you know how this is
So you run from it
I guess it all depends
What you want from it?
Have you been here before?
And you put it on my name
You assume that I'm the same
These are women I can never love or claim
I'll admit, I've been curious , I've been curious

[Verse 3]
And I don't know what to do
Is it me or is it you?
I can tell you if you wanna know the truth
I'll admit, I've been curious
Girl, I'm curious
