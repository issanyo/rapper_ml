[Verse 1]
Tell 'em
Tell 'em this girl wasn't made for lovin'
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin'
It's all I know, never learned much more
Tell 'em
Tell' em

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive
Said it'd ruin me one day
Cause every human that loved me, oh yeah
Seemed to push them away

[Chorus]
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, oh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
Real life, real life, real life

[Verse 2]
Tell 'em
I know you don't really understand it
I'm not allowed to regret my choice
I heard that love is a risk worth taking
I learned and know, I've never been that girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive, oh yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
Cause every human that loved me
Seemed to push them away

[Chorus]
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, oh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
Real life

[Bridge]
Heaven only lets a few in
It's too late for me to choose it
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone

[Outro]
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, oh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
Real life, oh
Tell 'em 'bout that real life, oh oh oh
Real life
We're talking real life, oh oh oh
Real life
Real life, real life, oh oh oh
Tell 'em
