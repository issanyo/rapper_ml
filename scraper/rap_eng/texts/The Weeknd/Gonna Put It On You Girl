[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I can take you to a place
He won’t go
Ride with me girl I’ll take you where
He won’t know

[Chorus]
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me

[Verse 1]
I wanna know
Are you taken?
Cause I'm waiting for somebody to show
Just spend the night
Girl, roll the dice
Going for broke
Lets take flight
This is the high life
Got money to blow
Or we can just spend time
And I’ll be your lifeline
So baby let’s go!

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I can take you to a place
He won’t go
Ride with me girl I’ll take you where
He won’t know

[Chrous]
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me

[Verse 2]
Look at you
Trying to get on my network
In the club looking fine
Getting turned up
Going out, drop ya head
Make ya neck hurt
Fuck my ex
Pop an x
Like an expert
Lets role out to my house
I’ll direct ya
Give me brain on my couch, intellectual
You got me in the zone now
Tell your friends I have to go now

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I can take you to a place
He won’t go
Ride with me girl I’ll take you where
He won’t know

[Chorus]
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me
I’ll be your baby
You’ll be my lady
And I’m gonna put it on you girl
That’s why you pay me
