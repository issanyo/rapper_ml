I know 'bout your pain, no
Was did after me
She get her boys and said no
And I don’t never wanna say you no

She got a gun on her hands
She get them boys out the stands
But just to give up and smile
Said she’ll ever do that she gotta a hold, no

Said I don’t know why did that anymore
She didn’t know what to say then
And i don’t even wanna say so, no

She said who are to me, I mean it
I don’t know, I feel it
Digging them out
And now we both on the road
She got me zoning

She said no no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no no no no no no

Where do I go? (x5)
From here

She got that blow
She got that blow
She got that blow, did it low
Said wanna know

Said where do I go?
Where do I go, no

She got that blow
She got that blow

Said where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go?
Where do I go on me?
