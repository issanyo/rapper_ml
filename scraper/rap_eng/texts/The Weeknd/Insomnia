[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I want to take my time (oh, oh, oh)
I would say forget my (wow, wow, wow)
I know you said, "Do you" (talkin' bout)
I know you said, "Do you" (talkin' bout)

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I don't sleep no more, no more, no more, no more (baby)
I don't sleep no more, no more, no more, no more (baby)
I don't sleep no more
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I make myself love you (woah, woah, woah)
I never say, "Told you" (no, no, no talkin' bout)
I know you say, "Love just" (love, love, love, talkin' bout)
I make myself love too, (love, love, love, yeah, talkin' bout)

[Hook: The Weeknd]
I don't sleep no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't sleep no more, no more, no more, no more
I don't sleep no more
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't (so do you)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Uh, don't watch it go
Just leave it alone
Don't ever keep no
Came out the Chi (woo)
I'm in your stereo
For show, zero
I say too low
I make you feel
I make you wanna go
