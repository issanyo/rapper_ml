(The Weeknd)
Listen, listen, whoa, yeah, listen, ooooh
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There’s a room full of niggas!
What you following me for?
This ain’t no fuckin sing-along
So girl, what you singing for?
It’s cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID’s and the trash we going straight to the top
Rooftop close with a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light skinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends first flight from Poland
A whole lot of cash first trip from Poland

(Hook)
Why? Cause they loving the crew, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oooooh

(Hendrix)
Yea
Weed smoke burnin’ smoke detectors
Gettin’ high for low moments. Who else can do it better?
But seein’ these niggas say they ball
I see no reason for them to get shot at all
And damn. They make somethin’ out of nothin’
They don’t even skate. But they always seem to be stuntin’
Why ya’ll frontin’?
And damn
But seeing as most people have it all
I see no reason for you to compare me to ya’ll
And damn
These reservations were only meant for about 20/20
Meaning we could’ve split it all about 50/50
Now you swervin’ down this road. Bitches be a lil bit tipsy
But whenever I’m gone. Tell us if you ever miss me
Cus by then. I’ll be in Houston. No pun to Whiteny
(Yea)
Sad. But it’s the fatal truth
Around the same age. Why you drink for the youth?
I mean do you need to do die, to see living proof?
Gone....Hendrix

If we broadcast swag
Nigga we the news in the city
