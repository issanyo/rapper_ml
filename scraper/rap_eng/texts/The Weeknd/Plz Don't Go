[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
Let’s stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’s stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’s stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let's stay until the last light fades

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
We've come from so far away
And right now, I think we should stay
You know there's so much more to see
So don't go home without me

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Please don't go home, please don't go
Please don't go home, please don't go
Please don't go home, please don't go
Please

[Drop: Jhene Aiko]
I'd like to ride it, ride it
I'd like to ride it

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
But let's stay until the last light fades
Let's stay until the last light fades
Let’ stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’ stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’ stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’ stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let’ stay until the last light fades, ayyyy
Let's stay until the last light fades

[Drop: Jhene Aiko]
I'd like to ride it, ride it
I'd like to ride it
Alright

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
I just wanna go wherever you go
I just wanna follow
