[Hook: The Weeknd]
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
On the lean poppin' Rose with a kush blunt
With a bitch, ass fat, see it from the front
Mind gone, man I'm trippy and my eyes low
Everything purple, all I see is weed smoke
Codeined out, but my bitch gon' try
If you say I ain't high, then you niggas lyin'
A bunch of Taylor's, Memphis niggas gettin' throwed nigga
A bunch of hoes in this crib, bunch of O's nigga
Off that oil and it's dirty and I'm feeling great
Smoke a blunt or two or three just to keep me straight
You getting high, what ho, make a decision
That medical promethazine trippy prescription
Cups overflowin', my vision is dizzy (my vision is dizzy)
I'm like Bobby Brown ho without New Edition

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Purple, purple, purple, cup always full
Pass it in a circle, everybody smoking good
On the daily might, smoke an ounce just to fuck around
Weed man sold out when I'm in your town
2050 Trippy, she got a sippy cup
They say don't drink and sip that lean but I mix em up
Turnt up to the max, real ratchet shit
She bad and she smoked probably half that bitch
You niggas still gettin' tipsy, catch me leanin'
Smoke some incredible, feel like I'm dreamin'
My crib in Cali like Texas sippin' DJ Screw (Rest in peace)
Fridge full of Bombay but you can't find no juice

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fast life livin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Codeine cups, Co-Codeine cups
Co-Codeine cups, paint a picture so vivid
