[Refrain: The Weeknd]
Tell me I don't get to cuddle up
Tell me how to say [?] love
I been with a [?] of me (ooh, yeah)
I don't ever wanna see your team (yeah, yeah)
Maybe you can be the one to touch
I don't ever put this off of love
"Abel, [?] send to pardon me"

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Send for me (woo, woo), send for me (woo, woo)
Send for me (woo), send for me (woo, woo)

I been thinkin' 'bout you late at night

Ain't nothin' else to really talk about
Boy, show me what you wanna do
These days, you been feelin' lonely
Baby, I been feelin' lonely, too
I'ma fuck it up, won't you show me some
Run it back like you owe me some

I don't ever put this off of love
"Abel, [?] send to pardon me"
