[Intro]
Wake Up
Wake Up
Wake Up

[Verse 1: Thursday Girl]
Please, mercy me
Let me fall out of love, before you fuck her
I beg you
I'll give you all my pills
I'll give you all that I need
Baby..
I see that she is beautiful
The most beautiful by far
I see that she makes you feel good 'bout who you are
But you see how much I need you?
You see how much I care? (x3)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I've been spending all my time, living for the thrill
All this money that I've thrown, All this liquor that I've spilled
I deserve this
I deserve her body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is﻿ all I know
Inspiration is all I have
So I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress

[Verse 3: Thursday Girl]
What do I do now that you're gone?
What do I do when I'm alone?
You've been running in my head
What do I do when﻿ I need sex?
You're my everything
You're my heart
You're my everything
You're my heart

[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
I thought I told you, a long time ago
Don't you fall in love..
Don't make me make you fall in love...
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me

[Outro]
Don't you fall in love with a nigga like me.. (x6)
Like me...
