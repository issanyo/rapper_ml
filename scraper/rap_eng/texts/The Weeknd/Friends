[Verse 1]
I remember when we started textin'
I was playin' it cool, you was flexin'
I know I wasn't the only one you messed with
But it was good, I was on to the next one
I remember when you started checking
Checking up, boy you must've learned your lesson
Tryna tell me how I always was a blessin'
Blessin', stated the obvious
Bitch you guessed it

[Hook]
Yeah I got you
Too bad I'm vibing, nigga
I'll be fine without you
Guess you found out all them other hoes wasn't bout shit
And now you're gonna waste your time chasing me

[Pre-Chorus]
Nigga, please
Ain't no need to waste your time
Being caught up over me
Nigga, please
I don't wanna hear about it
You can tell your friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (tell 'em about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you sayin'
How I roll, how I been on the low
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
You thought you was the nigga fucking bitches
Now you wishing you was with me
Living life so trill

[Verse 2]
Even all your friends that I was cool with
They all know that you be on that bullshit
Even though they didn't think that I was stupid
You did, but I ain't tripping just don't push it
It's cool, Imma focus on my vision
Cause you only get one pass, and you used it
You used it, amusement
So funny how you used to flex
How'd you lose it
Now you look so stupid
And it's so amusing, your effort is so useless
And now you're gonna waste your time chasing me

[Pre-Chorus]
Nigga, please
Ain't no need to waste your time
Being caught up over me
Nigga, please
I don't wanna hear about it
You can tell your friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you sayin'
How I roll, how I been on the low
Go tell your friends about it
(Go tell them niggas, tell them bitches
Tell them niggas, I'm just living)
Go tell your friends about it
Tell them how you thought
You was the nigga fucking bitches
Now you wishing you were with me
Living life so trill

[Outro]
Oh, what the fuck was you thinking?
You probably wasn't even thinking
Oh, shit, now you gotta tell your friends about it
You gotta tell them how you fucked up on the exotic
Bitch like me, what the fuck was you thinking
