[Verse 1]
Hardly ever home
No evictions, no evictions
When I make it home
Shake the ceilings, shake the ceilings
I been cooking up, out in L.A., out in L.A
I know what I want
There's no chasing, there's no chasing
I've been takin'

[Hook]
Oh my God
If you ain't fuckin', I'm duckin', you know the routine
You know the routine, you know the routine said
Oh my God

You know the routine, you know the routine
Motherfucker I'm out here, I'm out here

[Verse 2]
You know what I'm on (know what I'm on, yeah)
That's that feeling (that's that feeling)

Or the second or the seventh
She might be the one (she might be the one, girl)
Or the second or the seventh

[Hook]
Oh my God

[Verse 3]
I'm out here in the Trump Tower
I think I finally fell in love now
Her name was Tammy, she got hella bitches
Now tell me, while my niggas filming
Her cribs so empty need a center piece
20 racks a table cut from Ebony
She cut that Ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby
Now I ain't mad about the fact
That she out there getting' busy
But it ain't enough for the fallout
Ride it all night for the get back
Get it how you should
What's the hold up?
Got no time for that no one
But I won't start but I won't start
Girl, get your pretty

[Hook]
Oh my God
If you ain't fuckin', I'm duckin', you know the routine
You know the routine, you know the routine said
Oh my God
If you ain't fuckin', I'm duckin', you know the routine
You know the routine, you know the routine
Motherfucker I'm out here, I'm out here
I'm out here, I'm out here
Motherfucker I'm out here, I'm out here
I'm out here, I'm out here
