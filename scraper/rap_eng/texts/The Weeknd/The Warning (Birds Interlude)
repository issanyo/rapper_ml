[Verse 1]
I deserve your body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is all I know
Inspiration is all I have
To deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress

[Hook]
What do I do now that you’re gone?
What do I do when I’m alone?
You’ve been running in my head
What do I do when I need sex?
You’re my everything
You’re my heart
You’re my everything
You’re my heart

[Verse 2]
I thought I told you
A long time ago
Don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Don’t you fall in love with a nigga like me
