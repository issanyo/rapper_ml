[Intro: Juicy J]
What's up? This Juicy J in the building with my dog Star Slinger, nigga
We trippin' man! Preach, nigga!

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
My chain dumbin' (yes Sir)
Wrist game dumbin'. I get met money like Mr. Drummond
It ain't nothin'. Straight stuntin' (Let's get it!)
Drunker than the motherfucker
Tryna to write my name in something
Hot, saddity Asian woman. Fuck it, I need a gang of women
Kush dumbin', 808 drummin'
Big blunts got your main ho hummin', straight dumbin'
Flying in a Phantom Rolls, gas punching, doin' a hundred
Getting becky from your bitch while a nigga countin' money
Dumbin'

[Hook: Reggie B]
You don't want me to grow, no my dear!
Living in two different realities, I swear. (I swear)
You don't want me to grow, no my dear
Baby, dumbin' is a part of your strategy

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I swept up cheese and crackers
I put this on my dead granny
Break one of you bastards
Nobody like my brand Emmy
One night you blame us
I'mma make you famous
Cause if I get that butt, I'mma make that thang bust
Cash rules everything about me for real, yall
I'm all about the dollar, dollar bill, yall!
Patah! you know I'm dumb with the money spending
From the slums, no handout, ain't no money lending
Escalade, twenty-two, Beemer Crip blue
Love the money, hate to work, I'm a Black Jew
Block of ice on my wrist. Ho bad, nigga, spanish
VIP toastin' up fourty bottles of Rose now

[Bridge: Reggie B]
Get you some business, baby
Get out of mine
Our relationship clock just ran out of time, oh
You don't want me, no

[Hook]
You don't want me to grow, no my dear!
Living in two different realities, I swear
You don't want me to grow, no my dear
Baby, dumbin' is a part of your strategy, I swear
You don't want to grow, no my dear
Living in two different realities, I swear!

My chain dumbin', my chain dumbin'
My chain dumbin', my chain dumbin'

[Outro: Project Pat]
Yeah, it's your boy, Project Patah and Juicy J
Man, yall with a big money chain gang
Star Slinger, what it do?!
