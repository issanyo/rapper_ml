Shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots of Patrón
Shots of Cîroc
Shots of that Henn
We takin' shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots of Jäger
Shots of Bombay
Mixed with lemonade
We takin' shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Shots, shots, shots, shots

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Double shots a nigga taking, call 'em free throws
I'm Wilt Chamberlain, slam-dunking hoes
This ain't no Twitter ho
But you can follow, know ya swallow
A couple of shots to her head
She chase it with some nut
More shots than a drive-by, wasted in this bitch
No telling who I'm leaving with, hit her with this Henny dick
Jello shots, Jäger shots, she could barely finish it
I don't go to school, but I'm frat housed wasted-ded
Cranberry chased-ded it, Peach Cîroc wasted it
Kush in the pipe, like some crack free based-ded it
Lungs like a chimney, blast like Yosemite
So I advise you lame ass niggas don't say shit to me

[Verse 2: Nasty Mane]
Ughhh, man I'm feeling fucked up
Anybody getting wrong, they getting fucked up
I done took more shots than an NBA player
And send them strippers to my section cause we all players
I'm pouring Rosé on they body
They way they shake that ass I'm yelling good golly molly
I done took some molly, and chased it with some vodka
It got me turned up, acting wild just like Waka (bow, bow, bow)
I swear this liquor got me horny
I'm ready to fuck something and cook my breakfast the next morning
I can't help it, I'm just nasty baby
This just me being me, my name Nasty baby
