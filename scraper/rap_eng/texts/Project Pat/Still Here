[Intro: Lyfe Jennings]
It's that man again, haha
Some people refer to him as a hustla
Pimp, or playa

[Verse 1: Lyfe Jennings]
Street life killed my daddy
Got my momma pregnant in the back of a caddy
Since I lost my first tooth, I ain't been happy
Young, wild, nigga child, why that boy is so nappy
(He got the devil in him)
Police wanna take him down
Used to be a playa but the coochie cost money
He ain't too bright, but he know a trap when he see one
Got his conscious in his pants with his gun

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my windows, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my window, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But I'm still here though
Ohhhhh

[Verse 2: Lyfe Jennings]
Shoe box full of pictures
All that's left of good times I stayed with my niggas
Some alive and some no longer with us
How the, how the, how the hell do you pray for forgiveness
(When you got devil in you)
Rogaine keeps the hair strong (haha)
But cocaine keeps the cable on
I can't wait till my nigga JB come home
Why do all the real niggas stay gone so long

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my windows, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my window, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But I'm still here though
Ohhhhh

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
What? What? Yessir
Even though a nigga still in the hoo-oo-ood
Gettin' drunk and smokin' on woo-oo-ood
I'mma make it up outta this street life
On the corner is where I stoo-oo-ood
Out there all by my-self, cause a playa gotta get this mil
Wearin' fur ain't doin' us no good, flipping burgers ain't gon' make you filled
But I'm still ten-toes in this, hustlin' tryna make it hood-rich
And I still ain't trustin' no bitch, cause the motherfucka's always snitch
It's hard in this ghetto man, fifteen years old wit' coke and 'cain
Cheese don't come, I'mma go insane, snatch me a purse, snatch me a chain
Out here on the block, wit' the fiends and the moon, squeeze on the Glock, tryna pop at a goon
He done stole me dough, he took my food, Project wasn't born wit' a silver spoon
In my mouth, in my grille, wearin' six chains, then niggas get killed
One in the grave, the other in jail, nobody wins, that's for real

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
Back way, when I was a runny nose
Runnin' round, up and down the town
Carryin' a black Glock, and a gold frown
I kept that product on me, it wasn't no problem homie
You said it, I had it and met ya at the store for mo-ney
Just tryna buy bologna, but now I'm buyin' lobster
Still totin' a Glock, but pushin' a Rolls Royce and winnin' Oscars

[Interlude: DJ Paul]
Yeah, Three 6 Mafia, Project Pat
Lyfe Jennings
If you can believe, you can achieve
Every day above ground is a good day
Ya hear me?
Yeah

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my windows, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
Seventeen years of rain
Foggin' up my window, yeah
Hear the man? It done been seventeen years of pain
But, I'm still here though
Ohhhhh
