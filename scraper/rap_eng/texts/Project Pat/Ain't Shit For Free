[Verse 1]
Put them forgiato rims on a foreign whip
2 50 for the car I just hit me a lick
Haters talking off they ass, know I'm the shit
Loud pack got your girl mind blow like pistol grip
Project stackin' paper of shows like I'm movin' boats
Like I'm in the foreign chargin' snow bunnies and [?]
Straight up off the dresser, I'm a stresser that's what I'm about
Steering wheel is in her back I drive her to the crazy house
I just made a lick up off the pills, lick up off the green
Bitches out here talking bout I ain't shit
Bitch get up off me
Suck me like a vacuum, but I ain't coming off the weed
Project Rosenberg, I'm a jew
Bitch, ain't shit for free

[Hook]
Mane, ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, you can get the fuck away from where I [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, old monkey ass bitch [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, you can get the fuck away from where I [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, old monkey ass bitch [?]

[Verse 2]
Know this freaky bitch that say her car note payments due
Just a couple of hunnids,  but you know what she gon have to do
Wrap that curly tongue around my penis, you little slut
Suck that motherfucker til that ball can only rub

Hit her from the back
Make that ass clap like [?]
Simple, dawg just like bringing that work

Fuck that boy
One times
Played it cool
Even a nigga know I broke the rules
Two pounds of that shit was good
The rest of the shit was rabbid, fool



[Hook]
Mane, ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, you can get the fuck away from where I [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, old monkey ass bitch [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, you can get the fuck away from where I [?]
Ain't shit for free
Ain't shit for free, old monkey ass bitch [?]
