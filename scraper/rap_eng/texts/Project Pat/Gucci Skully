None but g's on my mind like a Gucci skully (x3)
Gucci skully, Gucci skully
None but g's on my mind like a Gucci skully (x3)
Gucci skully, Gucci skully

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I'm just gettin' to the bag
Project purp takin' drags
I would never touch the packs
All I do is count the stacks
Brand new Bentley drive I tag
Louis bags fulla cash
If you run up that's your ass
.45 let it blast
Plenty snakes in the grass
Suckers do not get a pass
Have my thugs beat that ass
Put you in a body cass
What you got not fucked up past
Junkies smokin' out the can
Used to be a major player now he down on his ass
So you seein' what I have and that made you niggas mad
Should have been hustling grams
But you are on my Instagram
Squeeze trigger it go bam
Catch a murder bout my fam
On my motherfucking paper bitch I do not give damn

[Verse 2: King Ray]
G's on my shoes on my head and my pocket
I'm runnin' that check out no need for a doctor
I'm ridin that ghost call it phantom opera
Kickin' shit just like karate
Your bitch wrap me like Kamisaki
Bendin' hard I get from the sock
I wax her ass like Miss Miyagi
Real niggas do real shit
I'm a trill nigga, that's some trill shit
Niggas nowadays so counterfeit
Nigga get wronged and that chopper spit
Fire, nigga that's on my mama
Bust a move if you wanna
I'ma leave you a goner
Don't you play with my money
Don't you play with my money
