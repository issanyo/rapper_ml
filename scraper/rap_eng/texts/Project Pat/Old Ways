[Hook: Project Pat]
They gonna make me go back to my old ways
Shooting pistols, robbing niggas, selling yay
300 pounds of Ghetty Green on the way
Dope kickers bumpin' Mista Don't Play
Homicide, extortion, kick your doors, murder
Robbery, assault and kidnap for drugs, murder
Homicide, extortion, kick your doors, murder
Robbery, assault and kidnap for drugs, murder

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Extended clip one in the head, where the dope
She mask up, tied up, taped and some rope
Hit a lick but have a brown, some pills and some smoke
They gave this bitch a eighth of gas for some motherfucking throat
Kick yo door with the chopper, poppin' yeah you already know
Deal with the street niggas, word on the street you a hoe
Never got a burner on ya, niggas think that you slow
Bro I'm fucking with you, make your food man that's for sure
Liars [?] you know how the jungle go
They say get up out the street, where a nigga gonna go
Robberie, drug sales, that's all a nigga know
Robbery or extortion, pussy nigga make your choice

[Hook: Project Pat]
They gonna make me go back to my old ways
Shooting pistols, robbing niggas, selling yay
300 pounds of Ghetty Green on the way
Dope kickers bumpin' Mista Don't Play
Homicide, extortion, kick your doors, murder
Robbery, assault and kidnap for drugs, murder
Homicide, extortion, kick your doors, murder
Robbery, assault and kidnap for drugs, murder

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Heard this sucker a street over really getting it in
Information gotten from a OG in the pen
Say his daddy was a gangster, but not he not respected
Son had a shelter life, he was street neglected
On his daddy name plugs fucking with it
OG say his green light on that boy so go and get it
Choppas with them [?] scope, we make no mistakes
Me and my dog lick that bag though like a birthday cake
Headed to the bedroom, nigga came out bustin'
My AK spit that dragon fire, let it start puffin'
Nigga screaming "stop shooting, what ya niggas want?"
I said where the motherfucking money bitch and all the dope
Nigga took me to his stash and we took all his shit
25 p's of Cali and a fucking quarter brick
Now that's a true lick
I came up in the hood, I came up off the hood
My niggas is understood, ya feel me?
