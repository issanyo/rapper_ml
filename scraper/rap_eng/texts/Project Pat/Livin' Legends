[Intro] Merkules
Please don't test my temper
I don't really wanna have to take there
Catch a free ride to that hospital and
You'd be lucky if you ever even made it there, yeah

[Verse] Merkules
Catch a hole through the logo on your shirt
Why you rappin' 'bout the game
When you don't know how it work?
Me and Project Pat got 'em goin' back to church
If the feds up ahead then we rollin' in reverse (skrt)
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with the kid
14 when I had my first malt to my lips
Straight wit the aim when I talk, I don't miss
Had a hypnotized mind since a youngin' I guess (facts)
I used to pray that I get this money
Now I get this money by the brinks truck buddy
Need a mansion and a yacht, til' I feel like Puffy
Summertime in the hood and it still not sunny (huh)
White boy and I'm big as fuck
White tee when I'm in the club
I need 3 bottles just to get a buzz
And I leaving this bitch til' my drink is done

[Chorus] Merkules
Got a problem? Let's address it
They got hit and learned their lesson
We some fucking livin' legends
Pray to God on my confessions

Got a problem? Let's address it
They got hit and learned their lesson
We some fucking livin' legends
Pray to God on my confessions

You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't want these problems

[Verse 2] Project Pat
Back on the bricks, makin' these licks
Sup with the shit? Count up our cash (cash)
Ice water whip, been with the shit
Back in the day, now we on blast
Didier of that lean, slanging them beans
Off of that stash, pounds of that gas
Money the power, pull up on cowards
Hittas on deck and they gon' blast (blast)
Flippin' that gas, stackin' these cakes
You in a ford, I'm in the wraith
Me and the plug done hooked up a date
Fumbled the bag, couldn't let you skate
Pray for a lick, I couldn't wait
Ride through the hood, see niggas' face
Ain't fightin' no case, back on the race
The draco, the mask, I'm back with the shit

[Chorus] Merkules
Got a problem? Let's address it
They got hit and learned their lesson
We some fucking livin' legends
Pray to God on my confessions

Got a problem? Let's address it
They got hit and learned their lesson
We some fucking livin' legends
Pray to God on my confessions

You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't really want these problems, no
You don't want these problems
