Nigga keep it 100
Ye ain't never been to jail, ye ain't never paid your home boy bail

[Verse 1: Jon Geezy]
But niggas be so emotional
Keeping my focus and doing just what I'm supposed to do
Tryina keep full bustin my pistol, my bills overdue
My daddy told me eat, you got a meal right in front of you
Or you can trigger off your fuckin money like your brother do
Trickin off my money on bitches, this somethin I never do
My homies getting locked for no reason, police the predators
You ever been locked for a season behind a metal door?
Ever been popped by your rival cause you ain't give him all?
I'm a get money regardless, that's what I'm livin for
Never sick the dogs on beef, that's what lieutenants for
These niggas getting early released, that shit is beautiful

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I done score, I done robbed, I done sold drugs
Some of ya'll listenin now with my customers
And I never one time mentioned niggas' names
I would never drop down, give yo mama pain
Just the same nigga if you get jailed in
Like yea I made room in that pussy, dough got clammed in
I'm the wolf like Del Toro
Catch me in some Polo, strapped with the 4 nickle
Solo dolo, Hennessey and colo
Or should I say Cola?
Thug baby down in Texas then I said ola
Said to myself if I'm cold then it's goodbye
This nigga sayin both the mans back in a good way

[Hook:]
