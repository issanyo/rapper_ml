[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Will I kill for my meal
Will I live, will I die
God forgive me of my sin
Gettin' full of Seagram Gin
High as hell
Lookin' for a way to take me from this pressure
Poverty and pain got a young nigga insane
On the street of the city
Lurk them killas and them thugs
Those who never show no pity
Come up short, feel them slugs
Of a tone in the back of your motherfuckin' head
Either get with the program
Or yo family is damned straight to death
Fifteen, seen a nigga meet his maker
Shot him through his heart
Killed him like the Terminator
Take da deadly situations that I'm livin' in
Animosity, no friend
Assed out, trying to get in
In the pen niggas sittin', wait on other niggas lives
Anger in my heart is struck
When I hit them bricks you fuck
So is a rocks is in your face it ain't no questions asked
You gon' drop that off your ass
When I squeeze the trigger blast

[Chorus: Buckshotz]

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
It ain't same silly somethin'
That wants to get with this pimp shit
He me who they scammin'
Say the dump nigga in a ditch
Initiate me quick
I want to be down with the Prophet clique
We blight the mess
Then you have to prove to me your loyalness
So he grabbed his gun
And he headed for the door
With a grin on his face
And a look, dat of a criminal
Dickey'ed all out
And his soul full of darkness
Thinkin' of what were sayin'
So he sped up the process
But knowin' what would happen if a bullet hit his gut
But the kids not feelins'
Hard made don't really did you run from then dead
He's always around him
And thinkin' will god forgive him
So now he's bound to confusion
And please my peeps I'm losin' it
I'm feelin' it
Temptation like killas might take it all over my soul
Cause he don't scare me though
I'm thinkin' of murder or robbery of course
Now were force
A force tuned to kick it
They don't have no remorse
And then you will become a

[Chorus: Buckshotz]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
It's your own nigga Project Pat
I'm a G as in gorilla
All my life I want to come clean
Why you flossin' on my dreams
To be rich
Which gon' get me first, a bullet
Or that jailhouse?
Since I ain't got shit to lose
Robbin you's is what I choose
Who shall be the one to face that gun
Like Russian roulette-tah
A hard time never did get better
Smart crime no bloody sweater
Better watch your back
Slangin' that crack
If you ever tell a
Make a withdrawal for your dog
Better yet, yall give me it all
Take a fall up in these streets
Make a lick back on my feet
Young nigga lookin up to thugs
Money hungry Nigga where them drugs
Where da dope is?
Gimme the cheese
Gun in hand, mama on knees
Hair trigger
I'm about to sneeze
Come on down
Trick off them keys
Please and pity ain't in my heart
Gangsta city mane don't you start
Actin' like you don't know the rule
Damn fools wear bepper shoes
In the river, take a swim
You can end up one of them
On the T-V or front page
Decomposed, been dead for days
