[Verse 1]
I could turn a 9 to a half to a whole thang
Funky smell out them parts like chitter night
Baking soda make that shit swell like dang-a-lang
You could get fucked in these streets, no jang-a-lang
Niggas kill a snitch over pussy, that's a petty thing
Getting it from the feds like canary, and you sang-a-lang
I don't get in niggas mixes, niggas bullshit
I talk money, crept flow dollar, with no pool pit
Money train gang got proof, looking for the jackpot
Left the bag get away, nigga that's a mouth shot
Sour homie lemon dead, take the cheese outta pocket
9 milli lemon squeeze shooting like a rocket

[Hook x2]
I'm just another nigga tryna make a dollar
Ain't turning nothing down, not even my collar
Brain from your baby mama, make that bitch swall-er
Fire up the gas, hit the gas and [?]

[Verse 2]
Slanging guns, slanging TV's, that was me
Hustling dro, slanging purp nigga that was me
Wrap the dumbies like mummies, nigga that was me
Balloons full a pills in a mules tummy,  that was me
Penitentiary a nigga made plenty gwuap
Cuz shit don't stop
Cuz a pimp got popped
Fuck niggas getting mad cuz we blowing loud
Heads in the cloud, money pow, to the clouds
Flipping money like a pancake, off the syrup
Choppas when we bring terror
Bread like Panera
And when I pull that bitch out, hands in the air-er
Don't waste a bullet, headshots, we ain't tryna scare ya

[Hook x2]
