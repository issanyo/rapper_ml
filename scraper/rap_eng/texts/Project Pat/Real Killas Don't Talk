[Hook]
Real killas don't talk (don't talk, don't talk)
Real Killas don't talk (don't talk, don't talk)
Real Killas don't talk (don't talk, don't talk)
Let them burners talk, blow your ass up
When there's beef, I'm pulling down on a nigga
In these streets, I'm pulling down on a nigga
If I find you, I'm pulling down on you nigga
Pull them burners out, 40 rounds on a nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm a side for the cash
40 Glock in the stash
Ass K no man trash bags full of cash
Kicking dough's murders hoes, pulling hoes
When you go body level on the floor
Get the dough to serve them all
From the grams to the pounds hustle gonna put it down
Shooting up any rounds locate to another town
With the sack with the gun
In the street it ain't no fun
Gun with the feel on with my hand on the gun
Fingers off the plug with the swag of a drug dealer
Pitches up home cook it to the close
Served out on Hotel 6 a hustler know that's the lick
Cocaine hard, you get caught, that's a charge that a steam

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you ain't with this street shit
Stay your ass in the porch
Cause when it comes to beef shit
Niggas do get torch
I smoke a nigga like a Kush blunt
Blow yo brains back of the head straight to the front
A nigga know just what it is with me
Don't need no niggas with me that burn or go stay with me
So if you wanna let yo nigga send you out
Watch this throwaway mad staying stick out
I pull down on my end of this blur face
I'm the last face he see before he get erased
I say that chopper it always got a beef taste
Nobody shots my dough, I'm aiming at yo face

[Hook]
