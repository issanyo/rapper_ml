Nigga please, know that you thought, a bitch need ya
Fuck you up, is for the good that I done left ya, man

Gotta nigga break down fuck me all against the wall
Tell me that he love me, taking shopping sprees at the mall
Clean my truck, keep yo son, boy, I'm out here living large
When I'm on my tour, he be giving me his credit cards
When I hit the door, we be fuckin on the kitchen floor

[Project Pat]
I'm have to holla back at cha, flip you like a spatula
Turn you into a bachelorette and I'm a be a bachelor
I'm a la spectacular, living like a macula
No, fix hair, fresh clothes, you on crackula
Dollars we can stackula, you wanted to actula
Like you was the boss, and you suck me dry like Dracula
You deserve a smackula, better yet a snapula
Right across yo lips, work your hips on the trackula
Fuck 'em til you sense-u-less, captin so ridiculous
Never hear, what you say, cause you speaking gibberish
You the bitch, yapping squaw, for some dick, on the stalk
You done got your walking papers, now its time for you to walk
Step on off and be a mom, dem yo kids I got none
You at home feeding yo son, but I'm out having fun
Riding clean smelling good, dipping in ya neighborhood
Saw you at the mattabus, looking hard, wish ya could

[Chorus] (Project Pat)
I don't need you anymore (that's right, that's right)
So, you can get yo little ass out the door (that's right, that's right)
Don't every bite the dick that feeds you ho (that's right, that's right)
Cause don't know ho, start no show (that's right, that's right)

[Project Pat]
I'm a gorilla on a ho-a, so BITCH don't you start
The cap cock booty ho, and the every card
Go steal a credit card, so we can play some paper
You got a rumpshaker, now that's a moneymaker
I'm mean a dummy breaker, don't be no instigator
I'll beat the brakes on yo ass like the terminator
I used to fuck, freaky slut, in the bo, bo  (booty)
I fired you, now you looking like some dodo
A rudy poo poo, that what ya really is
Ain't buying shit for dem rats, ho dem ain't my kids
You come a crying back-a, the key is what you lack- a
You drink some gasoline, I'm a bout to strike a match-a
I don't got nothing for-a, see you and I ignore ya
You used to be a vette (corvette), now you an old Explorer
It ain't a thang you can do to get back in either
You won't even get the privilege to suck peter

[Chorus] (Project Pat)
I don't need you anymore (that's right, that's right)
So, you can get yo little ass out the door (that's right, that's right)
Don't every bite the dick that feeds you ho (that's right, that's right)
Cause don't know ho, start no show (that's right, that's right)
