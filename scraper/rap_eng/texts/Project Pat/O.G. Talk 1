Yeah my nigga, the streets is the streets, you know what I'm sayin'? You know, everybody's somethin', everybody's affiliated with somethin'. Like everybody's got a mob, a clique, a gang, they know, that they in, they rotatin' with. And the thing is, it's nothin' wrong with that, my nigga, like I don't even trip on certain things. You a man so you make your won decisions. If you choose what you choose, what nation, what gang, whatever. You know, clique, homies, whoever you rotatin' with. That's who you roll with and that's what you s'posed to die with, you know what I'm sayin'? You s'posed to die behind that. But I'm not sayin' you go out in a blaze on some street stuff. I'm talkin' about dyin' as an old man, you know what I'm sayin'? I'm talkin' about, you know, standin' for what it stand for, you know. You takin' care of your own, your family, your children, and you know, helpin' your community out. Cause that's what it really stands for, you know what I'm sayin'? Like I'm not gonna put nobody's lit out there because I'm nothin'. But niggas know what they s'posed to be on, so you know, I mean my nigga, just need to be on that. Cause that's what's called bein' real, my nigga, you know what I'm sayin'? You know, it's nothin' wrong with what you doin', what you represent. Niggas have oppositions out here. If a nigga caught up and he get hit up, a nigga know what it was, you know what I'm sayin'?
