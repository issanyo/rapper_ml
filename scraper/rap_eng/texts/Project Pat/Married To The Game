[Intro:]
You know, I'm really sick of this shit
Ever since I hooked up with you I've been on my business
I think we need to go and jump this bro, you know what I'm talkin bout?
To the green, you see it?

[Verse 1:]
I wake up every morning, thank God for the hustle
Like Barack and Michelle this a presidential hustle
Plus I'm married to the hustle, every day like 100 move
Counterfeit leach, strip club, call me tycoon
Love her like my kids, ain't a think come between us
She's the love of my life, without a dollar, perfect wife
Treat her good, she treat me good, celebrate every night
I keep her on my mind, on the hustle, on my grind
She a blow a nigga mind like a shot of pure caine
I done had plenty pussy but this bitch ain't the same
You go ran up in my spot, tryna one out with my chain
Hot sensation in yo head, that's a bullet in yo brain
I'd kill for this bitch

[Interlude:]
I'm just sayin I mean
Motherfucker fuck with you
Then that's fuckin with me
You know what I'm sayin?
So... I mean... this shit til death do us part
I mean real talk
I don't see no way out this shit
It's us

[Verse 2:]
It was love at first sight when my homie hooked us up
My girl stay in the street but she far from the slugs
She be cookin in the kitchen, you could smell her through the vent
Our love so unconditional she pay my mama rent
Lord knows that I love her, street blessing heaven sent
She'll crush when I broke you other hoes irrelevant
Everything a nigga got she broke her back to help me get
Let me see the bigger picture, fuck you niggas let's get riches
She got a diarrhea swag, baby keep me on my shit
Remedy and my medicine, what my pockets see
If you playin with my money then you playin with my bitch
I don't fight over hoes but I'd kill for this bitch

[Outro:]
You know, I'd fight a war
But the thing is, you know
If a nigga fuckin with you they fuckin with me
You know what I'm sayin?
I mean we won
I mean you the one got me on
A motherfuck put they hands on you
They fuck with us
I mean I'm really gone all the way up
I mean cause, I think we runnin round here fucked up
I mean you got my nigga ridin in motherfuckin Phantoms and shit
Lamborghinis and shit
Mercedes Benz
Fuck I look like going back to old school?
You know I'm talkin bout?
