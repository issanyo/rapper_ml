[Hook]x2
Blood clot, roll up blood clot weed right now
Rude boy, don't be rude boy or get shot down
High as fuck
Geeking like I'm Marley bitch come try your luck
Homicide another track, hurry put your lighters up

[Verse 1: Wooh Da Kid]
Gun shots bangin' from the back block
My strap cocked up and down
Fiends running in and out the trap spot
Late at night, don't get caught slipping better have your gun
Front a young boy off a pack and he bound to run
FN, keep it fully loaded, I ain't flexing
I just went hard fucking Brittaney and her best friend
Rude boy, I don't fuck with rude boy you food boy
We don't fuck with snake niggas we know you a geek boy

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Homicidal, must be suicidal
Running off this vital, desert rifle
We can get gangsta', like a disciple
Blacked out, with the strap out
Ran your fat mouth, to the wrong bitch
Gun in chest blew your back out
Dope sold to the young and old
Cup of purple code [?]
Ferrarri swag play me like I'm slow
Put a fucking hole in his head
Now a shit bag what the nigga wearing
For the rest his life
But I tried to take his life

[Verse 3: Wooh Da Kid]
Atlanta where I stay, ATL my home
North Jamaica Queens running through my bones
R.I.P. Dunk tatted on my face
808's quake 'tino drop the bass
Blood clot, rude boy, hurry roll the weed now
Rude boy, Wooh Da I'm the king with the fucking crown
High as fuck geeking like I'm Marley and my uncle Snoop
Try your luck, you gonna need an army just to fuck with Wooh
