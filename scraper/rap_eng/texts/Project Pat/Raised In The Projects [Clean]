Tryin' to floss in the projects, mayne get ya jacked off
Run up on ya with the M*******, face smacked off
You could be the *** on the curb, get ya crack off
Fingers on the trigger full of ***, never slack off
Same gorilla tactics over here, pocket swollen
Pretty white guts, rims big as a Samoalan
Jolly rancher colors on the whips we be rollin'
North Memphis, Dirty South, you know that I'm holdin'
The hood on the weight of, my *** you stay up
Locked down now the town gettin' my pay up
It's Project Pat, the haters scream, "Oh no"
Hypnotize stackin' money by the boat load

We still cock 'em up, rock 'em down, come up love, ride the town
Flexin' out, lookin' good, still the same in the hood
Full of ***, full of crosses, ain't no love, ain't no losses
*** greed, want it all, cut the throat, of the bosses
Got them diamonds in the teeth, in the watch, in the range
Diamond out, necklace, diamond out, Fendi frame
You stay sweatin' the police cars on bricks
Givin' fake names mayne dodgin' all warrants
In the projects dope bodies'll get hauled off
You got twelve years old I'm shootin' *** off
These big booty chickens got suckers turnin' necks
Project Pat, Dirty South, welcome to the projects
I was raised in the projects, projects
