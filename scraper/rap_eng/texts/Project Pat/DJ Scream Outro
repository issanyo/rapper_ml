[Outro]
Yea, see when it come to these streets
Ya’ll niggas need to understand a couple things
You know you mention a name like Project Pat nigga
You gotta always pay respect, pay homage to that
That’s street Gods status nigga
Everything else sound like a offspring
So if you want to hear street music
And you want to hear it properly
Then you tune into this nigga
Project Pat!
Street God
Street Testimony
It’s the DJ Scream talking to you nIgga
