Taylor Gang in this bitch

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We're pourin' drinks in the club, smell the weed when we coming in
We ain't worried bout the game cus we running it
Got a joint, with a bottle in my other hand
Bitches love me, niggas hatin' on me cus I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband
I got cash in a rubberband

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Commas after commas, if it's money I'm comin'
I got bands, mister drummin' fuck the hoes that you lovin'
Designers that's nothing, private jet, man thats stuntin'
You never did this shit so my niggas start frontin'
Last lady with me, she ain't even legal
I let er drive the Benz cuz she match my ego
Derek Jeter set, Im ballin' like rollin'
Catchin' wind with the top down, I feel like Im ballin'
Money don't bend, zeros don't end
All this money that Im stackin' in, I done setting a trend
Still owning that real shit, you rap niggas are gon' kill shit
Hunned bands, throw it in the club
Don't give a shit cus I'm still rich

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I got 20,000 ones in my britches-s-s
Im'ma fuck the throw, all this only bitches is
You niggas life savin', one night you spending this
Shawty ass killin, she ain't leavin' no witnesses
We throwin' money all night, we ain't running now
On my Juicy J swag nigga and I'm showin 'out
Molly in yo girl ass and my dick in her mouth
If she dont finish all her food I ain't pullin' out
Rubberband bang bro, choppas that a blow a ho
Bigger than a hoola hoop through your residential door
Blowin' presidential smoke
This that Cali buzz
Man plus we makin' G's and getting our dicks sucked

[Hook]
