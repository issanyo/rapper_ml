[Hook: Project Pat]
Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride by your spot, shoot your fucking living room up
Nigga must on that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride by spot, shoot your fucking living room up
Nigga must on that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Throwing gas bombs to your resident, niggas running out
That's when automatic weapons got to popping out
Take you motherfuckers out, praying on a nigga skug
Niggas out here with the mean mug, face it get slugged
I got them thugs with machete and them mask out
I call them garbage men, they like to take the trash out
Catch you niggas hanging in the hood on them porches
Choppa like raid spraying off you cockroaches
Terminator shit, exterminating rats
Should have got a music scholarship the way my guns click clack
Blew out his back, for running off then face the man
Left his ass in the chalk, right beside the garbage can

[Hook: Project Pat]
Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride by your spot, shoot your fucking living room up
Nigga must on the that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride by your spot, shoot your fucking living room up
Nigga must be on that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Dope still getting sold, niggas still getting shot
Coke still in the pot, hood still super hot
All these years a nigga like me done been away
Some of these niggas staying the same position 'til they hair grey
Niggas always with the shit, that's some cold law shit
Got a hot 9 quick to blow ya ass off with
When the Ruger in yo face, drop the cash off bitch
Hair the trigger like a rocket get a blast off bitch
Shoot ya knee caps off, blow ya chest out yo back
.44 leave a doughnut hole, through ya ain't no coming back
Put my hands on the chopper, throw my life away
I can pop 30 rounds in this clip, 30 niggas get shot

[Hook: Project Pat]
Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride by your spot, shoot your fucking living room
Nigga must be on that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

Niggas know I'm straight thug
Niggas know I'm gooned up
Ride down your spot, shoot your fucking living room up
Nigga must be on that lean, cause he got me screwed up
Treat yo ass like a fiend I'ma shoot ya ass up

[Verse 3: Bankroll Fresh]
Nigga know I'm bout that shooting nigga you probably made it happen
Most of these niggas rapping nigga I started out trapping
Nigga you play with me nigga we gon' fuck around and splash him
Nigga you play with me nigga we gon' fuck around and blast him
Yeah the casket is out there, and I came a disaster
You gonna meet the fucking pastor, I'm in the hood I'm the rapper
Boy I top out and slap ya, I'm the fuck shit master
It ain't look like I do it I have yo ass bloody napkins
I don't play bought that paper, most of these niggas fakers
Most of these niggas haters, man these hoes got the vapors
Man I'm balling in Vegas, and I just bought the latest
Nigga play with me my nigga I'ma pop at your table
