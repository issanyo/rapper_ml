So on the train in the rain Scans waiting for you man

{MC Mack}

Arresting you niggas I got head on yall holler that I'm dead wrong

Got shit to make your whole hood battle
Yall hoes ain't seen an Uzi's arrow
From dusk to dawn leaving bodies numb with my gun

Or with Tear da Club up Thugs weapons like a GI Joe
Walk up to the sissy nigga where nothing can save him
Now sit back relax and let this 12 inch gauge in

{Project Pat}
Automatic gunfire when your time to die left you in a coma
Fucking off with busters in these streets got you causing drama
Marijuana feels my congregation your affiliation
With the wrong click of motherfuckers got annihilation
On your program who's the man with the master plot
Fresh up out the pen once again with the mask and Glock
Shot you point blank range feeling strange put that ass in shock
Project got an answer for you bitches Posse closing shop

{Gangsta Boo}
Nigga nigga what whatcha whatcha wanna do
With your pussy ass crew trying to get a load of Boo
I be the one to bring the pain bring the rain on a sunny day
Smiling in your face mean mug it with a pistol play
Know you bitches out to hate me I'm self explanatory
I'll leave you wet like a fat pussy in an orgy
Snatch your fucking soul I'm the cold that's in the winters hoe
Mess with me you die you can't tango with my .44
Drinking on some Henn and some V and some P it be in me bitch
Smoking on some weed 100% it be fire bitch
What you trying to do I done already did it baby
If you wanna rumble come get your ass up don't be a baby
Plain as it may be we done talked around each one of your cities
Ask my brother Eric he be witnessing what he ain't seen
But she don't bother no one she be Mrs. Lady claiming clout
On your ass we'll make a test to blast what they talking bout
