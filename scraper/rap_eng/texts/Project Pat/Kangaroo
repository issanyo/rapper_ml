[Intro]
Feds coming in trap jumping like a kangaroo
Money on asses in the club jump like kangaroo
Feds coming in trap jumping like a kangaroo
Money on asses in the club jump like kangaroo

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
There's money to be made
Cars to be caught
Ain't no money in the air
[?]
Real low
Dick harder than a steel toe
Banging that ass on up like it's a deal doe
Freaky bitches making witches to the [?]
10 minutes in then I'm squirting
Fat ass take a bitch long way in life
Tatted up stretch marks and that cellulite
All this shit a' make a dollar in their proper places
I'm making big bass
More loud in your faces
Ciroc by the cases
Sparkles on them bottles
Like the way she twerk that ass
When she walk and waddle
I'm a type of nigga that's gon' get this bread one way or another
I ain't tryna' trust
No nigga
No brutha
I'm just trynna' get a hundred million of another
Y'all know how we do down here in the gutter

[Hook]
Feds coming in trap jumping like a kangaroo
Money on asses in the club jump like kangaroo
Feds coming in trap jumping like a kangaroo
Money on asses in the club jump like kangaroo

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
Jumping like a kangaroo
What the fuck you think you do?
Better get your money before I down you like a drink or two
Ain't too many fucking with the king, you better check yourself
'Fore you end up getting beat the fuck up 'round here you can thank yourself
I get this money
Tell them my hustle
Everything flexing
Look at the muscle
Riding round and I'm getting it
Better check that shit cuz I'm ignant
Got a hundred racks and i spent it
In a black Maybach I bent it
On the corner
Who the fuck does you think that you playing with

Something like a six four impala

They ain't trynna' holla'
Ace town street king
Ghetto scholar

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Trill]
You ever got money with a real nigga?
Come on, keep it real nigga
I'm wearing [?]
Money grow on trees that's why banks got branches
Jumped in my old school
Drove it to my old school
No Fannie Mae
I was never old school
Seen the same teacher from my home room
Said I wouldn't make it
Stupid bitch I told you
You lied
So I called Trae Tha Truth
And I hit Project Pat now we balling to the booth
I get bitches, I get bread
Your bitch give me brain, she always thinking ahead
Uh, she get it jumping like a kangaroo
I get it jumping like a kangaroo
If its prom there's no telling what my thing can do
Till I get downs what I came to do
Trill!

[Hook]
