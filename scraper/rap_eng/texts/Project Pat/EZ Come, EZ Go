[Verse 1]

A lotta niggas talk that shit and end up gettin' they wigs split
It's M.C Mack, a nigga known for smacking jack and crackerjacks
Busta ass nigga run yo mouth and get your ass blown off
Watch me put my ski mask on
Cock my gat back trick, now drop it off
Lanes get very quick and tricks that tried to test they nuts get stuffed and zipped up in a body bag to let you know yo ass been had
(?) weak ass niggas looking, throwing up the wrong sign
I'm staring at them like they J. Cole, bitch you ain't no friend of mine

Shoulda stoop a sucka in a minute don't you give a fuck about another nigga if he's bigger you should cap his ass
Nigga like the Mac'll smack a nigga like a nigga smack a bitch you cluckas, thang no busta

Smacking, crack a niggas dome with the handle of my chrome
So now you wishing you didn't run your licka nigga lane we popping
Gon' see once again
I got to show these lemons who they dealing with
Don't play me weak or soft 'cause all my niggas keep a fucking yalk
Classify this lemon pillars, let's make a stain, shoot that thang
Like Crunchy said you stupid hoes
EZ come and EZ go, bitch

Point me a tone, right dead at ya dome fool
