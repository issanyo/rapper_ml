[Intro:]
Yeah, I know a lot of y'all niggas out there
Gettin' your weight up, hittin' them push ups and shit
But how many of y'all getting' your smoke on properly?
You know, hittin' them kush ups
Puff, puff, pass, nigga
Project Pat
Nasty Man, Bun B, let's go

[Hook:]
Puff, puff, puff, pass
Puff, puff, puff, pass
Puff, puff, puff, pass
Puff, puff, puff, pass
Puff, puff, puff, pass (we doin' kush ups)
Puff, puff, puff, pass (we doin' kush ups)
Puff, puff, puff, pass (we doin' kush ups)
Puff, puff, puff, pass (we doin' kush ups)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Smokin' so much kush it got my forehead sweatin' (woo!)
Relay blunts, pass 'em like batons, smokin's what I do
Fell off in the kush session, tapped out, I was through
You got Cali goods on deck, I need a zip, I'm comin' through
Smokin' back-to-back like Rastas do, eatin' pasta too
Ain't no flexin', see these papers and these Swishers we ran through
Smokin' gram after gram, Cheech and Chong session, hoe
Blowin' kush ups in the gym, AKA the studio
I get UFO high, E.T. kush
Purple Cali what I love, the smoke I buy it by the bush
I love that lemon sour D, blue dream that's the herb
I'm so loud in the room but I ain't said a word

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bun B]
I'm fuckin' 'round with my trill niggas, my real niggas, my boys
While y'all niggas all burnt up, we turnt up like noise
We pullin' out them toys, we droppin' tops so 'cise
With that big grill and that fifth wheel you know we super tight
Daytime or in the night, but you know we packin' that loud
Walk into a room of them weed heads and we still stand out in a crowd
Their noses go up in the air, they lookin' out for their set
Just look for me, that trill OG, we in here gettin' bent
That's just how I represent, nothin' but that PA in me
And you ain't got to ask who keep that good, player, it's been me
I been twistin' them Sweets, I been breakin' that good down
Been bleedin' these streets, nigga we been burnin' this hood down
Hold up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nasty Mane]
Puff, puff, puff, pass
My weed louder than a fuckin' marchin' band
Most of you niggas, been smokin' on that garbage, man
My weed stay stinkin', just like some garbage, man
Look, I'm blowin' on that blue dream
Hey, it got me hype – I call it "turn up green"
Look, I'm workin' out – on them Zig Zags
Five doobies in rotation, that's a plane crash
I got a bad bitch with me and she blowin' weed
The next thing you know, she was blowin' me
I swear she a wolf, man
She huffed and puffed and blew me down
Damn...

[Hook]
