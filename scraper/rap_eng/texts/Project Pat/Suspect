[Hook: Project Pat]
Nigga I grew up with
I can't even fuck with
He can look you in the eye then that nigga suspect
Suspect, that nigga suspect
He can look you in the eye then that nigga suspect
You can't trust these niggas
You can't trust these hoes
You can't trust these niggas
You can't trust these hoes
Suspect, that nigga suspect
He can look you in the eye then that nigga suspect

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
When you getting mula, suckas majors come yo way
Nickel play
Put it up like gang signs in yo face
Face the facts
Yous a washed up ass rap
Boy I stand up
Like comedy you [?] hard bitch get yo grams up
I don't understand dubs
How ya be believing niggas
They like crooked preachers y'all
Out here deceiving these niggas
I done duck taped, raped niggas pockets, took they goods
Show these niggas [?] shot on whole hoods
I don't owe you niggas shit, foreign rides, blowing dope
Talking bout what you don't know
We getting money is all I know
Getting money's all I speak, I don't never trust a bitch
Talking all that broke shit, that's that foreign language

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Don Vito]
Niggas flodging like they jugging, never you've been tossed a pack
Take it back a couple of years ago when [?] had the sack

Niggas get their whole hood shot, fucking with the bitch
Pussies selling, pure talking, stunting out here like you the mane

Quarter thang served it all

Discovering packs and you my co defendant need you telling bitch
You a hoe in between
May believe
Powder puff
Drum line, [?] start talking bruh
