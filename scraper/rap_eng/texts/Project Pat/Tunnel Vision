[Intro: Project Pat]
We got millions on the table now, we not stressing
A gutter-ass nigga like me didn't got a blessing
Foreign whips, oldschools keep these bitches guessin'
The streets taught me a lot and I learned my lesson

[Hook]
Tunnel vision, tunnel vision, tunnel vision, tunnel vision
Money, money, money, money, money
Tunnel vision, money (x5)
Tunnel vision, tunnel vision, tunnel vision, tunnel vision
Money, money, money, money, money
Tunnel vision, money (x5)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
If you ain't gettin' money, why the fuck is you complacin'
Staying with your momma, still sleepin' in the basement
You lazy-ass niggas better get up off your ass
I ain't crippin' but with [?] cash
I'm breakin' hoein ass tryna go and make a playin'
Ramen noodles on your bowl, but I want a t-bone steak
I'm always on the hustle, I gotta get paid
A nigga beem gettin' bread since the 7th grade
Hood hot as fuck like a microwave
All my niggas cutthroat like a razorblade
Heterosexual with my money, I been straight
Everday your birthday, if you gettin' cake

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
The other shit he better been if you ain't talking bread
Tunnel vision on the money, keep your pussy, keep your head
Cause I can take that pussy, bitch and go cop a  whip
Hoe, your head can't buy a nigga a ticket, when I take a trip
The conversation money we can chop it up and talk it
If you ain't speakin' money, speakin' marching I'm gon' walk on off
I do not care about the snitchin' and who got the bricks
Unless we plottin' up to go and take some niggas shit
You niggas like to get high, but  don't to get sob
The dope game like pimpin' it never get old
And when it comes to money fuck a friend
Only friends I need is Mister Grant and that OG Ben's

[Hook: Project Pat]
