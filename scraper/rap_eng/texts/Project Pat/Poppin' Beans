[Hook: Project Pat]
Arkansa' gettin' money just like Tennessee'a
Poppin' beans, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a
P-P-Poppin' beans, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a
Choppin' bean, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a

[Verse 1: B-Money479 & VITO]
High level to the max, Adderall we movin' fast
Sippin', smokin', chilling bitch, we try'na make the mood last
We money makin' slow - 'cause I'm gone off the blow
Line after line, row after row
Shroom-man, [?], LSD zoomin'
So much smoke look like a pesticide fuming
Yeah! But we ain't going nowhere
So damn high got frosty covered nose hairs
You can say that shit [?]
Was a picture perfect moment while lies on the black plague
[?] your assumption
Fire to the bowl then we munshin'
Cause we next and you can't even deny it
Don't need a fucking buzz, we'll just start up a riot
So grab your lighter, in the bleed for Jesus
All we need to get them new rides so the Krew can hit the sea

[Hook x2: Project Pat]
Arkansa' gettin' money just like Tennessee'a
Poppin' beans, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a
P-P-Poppin' beans, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a
Choppin' bean, sippin' sizzurp and Hennessy'a

[Verse 2: Shayd479]
I'm pouring up like my name was fucking Pimp C
Or DJ Screw, that's Robert Davis, he the fucking king
He taught the whole world to slow it down and chop it up
Then Big Moe taught me all about that purple stuff
But I learned all about rolling thangs to the vauge
Gettin' hyphy on some Phonk, R.I.P. to Mac Dre
So now I think it's time to start popping beans
Till the draws get fucking tore up and we can't sleep
Then give me cognac till I'm falling off my back
And turn up Mr. Don't Play, you know the homie Project Pat

[Bridge: JGRXXN]
Yeah mane, my turn? Yessir!
Mane, I'mma show you how we do it down here mane

[Verse 3: JGRXXN]
What's the deal? Rolling on the pill
Silling on the seal, on the real
Sippin' on a 4, that'll make you feel
Oh, so good, and she got the good
Sucking on my wood
It's that phonk banging in your trunk
Ridin' through your hood
I'm JGRXXN with Promethazine
Swisha full of green
Fuck that Bobby Brown cycle sound
Falling in the steam
Fuck a bitch, while I break her back
She lickin' on the sack
Of the fruity stuff and on that tube [?]
