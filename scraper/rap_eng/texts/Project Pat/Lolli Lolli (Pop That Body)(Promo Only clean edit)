Please lord, have some mercy
This girl is throwin' judi

See she went front then back
She went side to side
I'm throwin' blank checks

One pocket full of pills
A little bag of that cola
The other one full of weed
And a semi auto pistol-a
I ain't no dancin' dude
But I can lean like a cholo
See mami go wit me 'cuz I can't be goin' home solo

They call me the juice when I'm at strip club
I put down a hundred or a dub
I'm a mac to a playa
I'm a stud
'Cuz when I leave the club I'm a fuck
Ride with the man and be givin' up the brain
Little skinny I'm a ride wit ya
I don't even know your name
Theres a whole lotta room in the front of the van

Like Barack Obama said its time for a change
Put a roll on the back seat
Pop that body now you know that ya got me
You'll find a chick thats kinda classy
Said her name was antine now I'm grabbin'
Got a grip on the whip
Big round booty with the silicone tits
She bouncin' on my lap and she tryin' a own the six
I whispered in her ear its hard for a pimp
