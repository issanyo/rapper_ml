[Hook x4]

That drank, that drank
That drank will make ya think, sizzurp

[Verse 1]
Sippin' on some purple
I'mma call it yurple
Leaning to the sizzide
Cool like I'm Urkle
Weed got me percule
Eyes tight like girdle
Cruising through the hood slow, something like a turtle
Strapped with them triggas
Hanging, hanging with my niggas
Errybody flossed out cause we stacking figgas
Hoes getting nothing but some of this nutt in-side
Their esophagus bitch you give me something
On this hydrocodine
Or promethazine
Sipping on the sizzurp
Sipping on this leazzing
Macking in my mizzind
I'm staying hizzigh
True to the shit I do & that's till I dizzie
Suckas wanna stizzeal
I'mma keep it reazzal
Do watcha gotta do mane to get a meazzal
Never was a hater
I'mma stay a player
Sipping on this good drank doe everyday

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Per-per-percocet, xanax I got the best deals
I likes to get powered up off them x-pills
Something to get my swerve on codone dranker
Straight out the North Memphis, Tenn' on them chrome twenkas
Niggas that hate always end up with hot lead
I'm with them killas hanging out and we ain't scared
Just like my niggas down in Dallas mane we already
Swanging that work drink that purple with that erky-jerk
My grill is gold when I smile but ain't shit funny
Like U.G.K. we be hustling for that dirty money
We got them hoes that are pros shaking big booties
Down with their mane getting that dough doing their damn duty
I'm on this drank & this drank got me straight mellow
Most niggas love purple 'surp I prefer yellow
We been on this, on the town since the 70's
Some trill players out the south is who we be's
