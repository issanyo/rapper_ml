[Hook: Scan Man] 2x
We felt the pain from the rain, now we still here
Standing strong, holdin' on, nigga bring it on
We paid our dues in this game, time for things to change
Feelin' good, lookin' good with all the finer things

[Verse 1: Scan Man]
Acid rain, the pain absorbed deep into my skin
Thinkin' when the days of destruction are gonna end
Right now I'm hot, temperature burnin' like the flames in hell
Ticked off, pissed off at this crooked place I dwell
Down here I see no precious light, green grass
All I see is black lights and them haters on my ass
(Can get you blast)
You damn right cause I can't be the one to rest
If I did I won't be here now, down with Prophet Posse
So bitch your time's up, Kami Kaze niggas finna rush
Like my nigga Mack said (Busta what, we don't give a fuck)
It ain't about the Versace, Tommy Hil' and shit
First towns black (?) but I'm livin' like a wicked prince
So bow down, show respect cause I'm earning my shit
And I'm a Kami Kaze soldier, I die for my shit
So while I'm on my way to the T-O-P
You haters and fakers ain't got shit to say to me
Cause...

[Verse 2: MC Mack]
I got the plastic like elastic, pull the thing, watch niggas die quick
More drugs and thugs, no love is who I run with
Kami Kaze, me and I do whatever to get whatever
No matter the reason or season, the pain from rain is never ceasin'
Defeaten, my one and only purpose to stack cheddar
Confederate scrilla can only help this Mack get better
And wether I hope a nigga can sustain and maintain
The same things like fortune, green and wisdom
Top that off with hoes and fame
We came to take control like votes
And for those that lost they soul from all the stuff that they stole
Behold, we comin' up slowly surely, but surely
These haters scopin' and watchin'
Man while I'm flossin' my jewelry, they fear me
Don't let these clockers come across me and my cheese
Away from droppin' off tapes (?), now gettin' bumped on CD
So please stay keep to all the words comin' straight from the Mack
For a fact I'm representin' that until I'm layin' fat on my back
In this life (?)

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Drowning from my past pressures, deadly measures what I take
Just to make it in this world, just to make it day by day
Every day is a test and I'm blessed to be alive
Preachers preach we should not steal, but I still must survive
Any means necessary, now I'm burried in my sin
Wishing all this shit would end, so I'm turning up the Gin
Glass bottle - take a swallow, not a model for the young
Not a victim - I ain't dumb, that's why Project packs a gun
Anyone can be got though Project keeps a lowpro
Your money good as gone when them robbers get your info
Deep inside a brothers mind, doin' them crimes what I'm doin'
No respect for a woman, all I want is the chewin'
I'm pursuin' good times and makin' it like J-J
Papa was a Rolling Stone, but I'm not a baby
Kid-kidnapped in this trap, fuck where you livin'
Time for me to be released from this ghetto prison
