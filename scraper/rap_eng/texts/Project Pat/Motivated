(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Here I goes on my hustle playing
Niggas know that I stay
Down on this money man, this is do or die
Hater's mouths be running
But the bills still comin
Either you gon' lay it down
Or you get up on ya something
Being broke is a joke
Very hazardous to health
I don't sell no dope
Playa, dope sell it's self
Gotta floss in my wealth
If ya got it, then show it
Twenty-thousand at the Lennox Mall, I'mma blow it
Petrone, I'mma pour it
Purp, I'mma roll it
Gun to ya head, squeeze triggas, brains blowin
Hood nigga from the North side, Memphis Tennessee
Tatted on my left arm, spelled like Hennessey

(Hook)

(Project Pat)
Yeah, this go out to all you niggas in the streets
Who don't know what'cha doin

(Verse 2, Project Pat)
Fe-fi-fo-fum, you can feel the slugs
Of this Mossburg shotgun, chest full of blood
You can say that your life could end in a flash
Like the wind blows dead brown leaves to the grass
I ain't goin back to jail, when it's on then I shoot
Momma, get'cha black vest on and a body-suit
Meet him at the altar, don't forget'cha flower basket
Full of Holy water, dead in a casket
I'm a basket, of a case
Either them, either me
Dyin all that older
If you go, so it be
See these niggas, they be hatin when ya flossin
Got the bread, I'm just blessed out hurr
And I gotta stay

(Hook)

I'm motivated by the haters
