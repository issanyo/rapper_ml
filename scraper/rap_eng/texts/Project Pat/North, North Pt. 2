[Intro: Juicy J]
Yes sir once again it's on, Juicy J featuring Project Pat
Chronicles of the Juice man, North North part 2
Raise ya thumbs up my nigg, it's on fool

[Hook: Project Pat]
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
North north in this thing and you know we runnin things
Everybody raise ya thumb, everybody show your gang
March in a cirle man, muscle up until you strain
Project Pat and Juicy J, the nigga with them gold fangs
Yes we keep the lightest dope
Yes we house the freakiest hoes
Then we ride to evergreen, on the block is where we post
Policeman can't stop us, I think they oughta stop it
I'm talkin' in that ghetto English, sayin' fuck the mobsters
Gangsta niggas walk up in the club
High as hell because we full of drugs
What gang you claim, the way they wore them hats
Don't get too close be careful we be strapped
We put it on the map, we keep our gezees flapped
And if you see me in the hood you better give me dap
I'm known as a veteran, my picture should be stacked
From smokin sin to Hollywood they wild over there

[Hook: Project Pat]
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
If ya ain't from my hood you can get the hell from round here
Cause we gon' smoke hydro and we gon' drink beer
It ain't no mu'hfuckin secret cause we some thugs
It ain't hard, you can peep it we sellin drugs
So don't you cowards step wrong, Smith N Wesson
These automatics have ya ass singin' a different song
A mega blast from these rocks, got the track jumpin'
A North Memphis nigga sell dope I'll tell you somethin'
Ya car bumpin ridin' clean and you see me bold
And now you wonderin' why we kickin' in your back door
This ain't no suburb my nigg this the ghetto
And you gon come through flosin like a pretty ho
A no no for you off, turn her on niggas
Show some love or you will meet them chrome triggers
We smokin bud, sippin' sizzurp and poppin' pills
You need some work come on through we got the best deals

[Hook: Project Pat]
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
I done lived in the North round the way
I done planted playa seeds in the mutherfuckin bay
Hypnotize is the label that you don't wanna hate
I done seen niggas make it, I done seen niggas sprayed
Brothas on the same block till his hair turn gray
Still all about a hustle, punchin' clock no way
The police hit the block, swallow rocks, throw the hate
Back in the same spot the next fuckin' day
Project Pat wassup

[Project Pat]
Jimmy Jimmy cocoa puff you know how we roll
Nigga is gon' get shot up, trippin' wit this north
Ride up outside yo dog, pullin' up them logs
Squeeze on them triggers, empty clips and reload
If you got beef, my nigga you better bring it
The hood buck as hell, the police couldn't tame it
Inhalin' palm trees something you can't hang with
Hydro with red hair, something I can slang trick

[Hook: Project Pat]
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
North, raise ya thumbs up nigga
