{Juicy J}
Hurt nigga
I'm coming out the fucking closet
Stay the fuck up off my dick
I feel the bucking poppin',poppin'
Boy I ain't a ho
Cause I caught you bitches liquor store
Niggas that need somthing in yo' ???
Punk yo' nuts broke studio
Gangsta step up to the fucking wheel
Call you nigga,call yo' click
And please tell them shoot to kill
Wishing that you would pop yo' nuts
Cause I'm throwing them thangs
Take care of your business bitch
Now we'll see who run your game
Ho

{DJ Paul}
These niggas all in my face
My face these niggas be yening
I'm mixing screwdrivers wit' J
But don't forget the gining
And then I go show my rings
And my fake gold chain
(Edit)Grab the nine like I'm off Soul Train
But I wait
Let them haters move first
Hundred more bustas I'll make
Befor I finish a verse
Verses getting crucial
Crucial verses getting
Cases be spinning
Niggas hittin' but I'm hittin'
??????

Chorus(2x)

{Lord Infamous}
Homicide minded
And you've been blinded
Bodies I hide 'em and you can find it
Hurt your whole faculty
Invert your reality
Task force, SWAT team
Martials are after me BLAY!
Trail of blood drips
Stiffs in the fortress
Had to blast his organs
Took all his fortunes
Importing weapons
Put it on my beltings
Weapon your skeleton
Like a wicked witch
???? see them bail

{Project Pat}
Be the next nigga to fall
Wit' these mags and these techs
I be the next nigga to ball
In your shift,flip the script
See another chapter
Has been written in this game
Project Pat is the pastor
Mane I'm after Lucci, Lucci
Like a deacon in a church
With these infra-beam eyes
Scooping out a bitches purse
I dispearse killer lyrics
Like a tone in ya mug
Hypnotize Minds gotta
Nigga high on some drugs

Chorus(4x)
