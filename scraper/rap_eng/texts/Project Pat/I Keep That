[Hook] x2
I keep that fie-fie-fie-fie kush
And that wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack
Wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack
Wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack
I keep that fie-fie-fie-fie kush
And that wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack
Wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack
Wh-wh-wh-wh-white sack

[Verse 1]
I'm on the cu-cu-cu-cu-curbin', white I'm out here servin'
Suckers goin' to the feds early cause they splurgin'
Kush be the herbin', sold in the urban
Co-mmunity, all the way, to the 'burbs and
Still keep the white girl cause she is my hook-ahhh
Bakin' soda, pot, glass jar, I'm the cook-ahhh
Rock it up, mix it up, cut it up, fix it up
Crumble kush weed in the blunt, then we twist it up
Patron in my cup, runneth over, they don't like that
Holla at a, nice rat, big booty and nice rack
Fresh, cars and clothes be the mayne, wit' the white sack
Lookin', for that good, chirp me up I'm chirpin' right back

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
I make the trap boom boom, rollin' hard e'ery night
Hustlers, comin' through, for that green, and that white
You can have it yo' way, just like, Mickey D's
No sidin' in the Bay, 'round here we blow, trees
Money out the wallets, for that good, product
Purple kush, sticky ave goo, what we call it
Project, is a chiefer so we, gon' smoke, the best
Inhale the weed, but the weed, go in, ya chest
Sell coca leaf, but to keep, the pockets fat
Always kept a heater, stay watchin', for a rat
Franchiser, trap house, is what, I do
Comin' to a hood real soon, that's right, near you
