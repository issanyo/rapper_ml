Put the needle on the record mayne
Put this *** together for my boy Project man
Here we go, some mo' gangsta mutha*** *** man
It's goin' down know what I'm talkin' 'bout? Hypnotize Minds, yeah
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
I'm flickin' on you snakes, I got wood, leather stitchin'
Clothes stickin' 'cause ya ridin' bucket cloth seats itchin'
Couldn't get me saw it in the clouds like my *** Rickey
Mr. James, all these superfreaks, out here tryna get me
Wanna hit me, wanna say, they done been 'round the truth
In ya bed or the booth, I'm the ghetto Dr. Ruth
When I do step on out, moonlight hit the Range
Pretty jewels they attract broads like shiny thangs
When I came to ya hood, I was new face in the place
Game spitter from the North so ya wanna catch a case
'Cause ya see me holl'in' at 'cha ex-girl, don't 'cha?
Murder charge for a broad who don't even want 'cha
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
You suckers crazy, so y'all out here pushin' daisies
Over Daisy, she was on some purple ***
Had the baby, year later on my income
Tax so a *** could receive mo' income
Been one, I'ma rent some of this game out
Gift of gab, talk you by the slab wit' no thang out
Hangin' stout broads, 'round my arms, decoration
These punks give me dap, same time playa hation
Erasin' you lamers, hatin' got'cha famous
Confronted by the broad, got shot in ya ***
Heinous, heard they took the slugs out'cha dookie roll
Gun powder and the blood burn in ya *** hole
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
I was screamin' "Don't Save Her," was you, listenin'?
Kept twinkle on my gold teeth, so I'm glistenin'
When I open up my mouth these gals lookin' in
Hear the words that I speak, then go and tell her friend
Dog all over freaks, boys goin' to the pen
Or the grave real early, hollow shutters check 'em in
Wanna fight my ***, wanna shoot my ***
Talk ya gal out her cap, when ya loot my **
Do you my *** fall in love wit' these ***
Goin' raw on her and she did the whole camp?
But you rest havin' that knowin' that, she'll go
Lickin' *** *** *** *** burnt from the flo'
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
You see me in this new car, this what money do
You see me shinin' like a star, this what money do
I left the club wit'cha broad, this what money do
This what money do, get you some hater
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
Throw a stack in his face, it ain't nothin' but some money
