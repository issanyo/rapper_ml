(Intro)
Nahmsayin' we flippin' n' stackin' n' flexin' on you sissy ass niggas nahmsayin'
Yeah we hood rich, bitch

(Chorus)
Keep you suckas in my rear view; my money on my mind
Give a fuck about that other shit; I love them dollar signs
You on some sucka shit; only thing you runnin' is your mouth
You on some other shit; only thing you runnin' is your mouth
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flexin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flexin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flexin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flippin' I'm stackin'
I'm flexin'

(Verse 1)
You catch me in and out that bank; that's how you know I'm on my grind
She say fuck a horoscope; she just love them dollar signs
Bitch I'm flippin', I'm stackin', I'm robbin', I'm jackin'
I'm strapped up nigga, I'm smashing
Been pimpin' hoes, been hittin' licks, been robbin' tricks
Lil nigga what's happenin'?
Got a crazy plug on that syrup; got a stupid plug on that work
Y'all just talking n' flossin' dawg; ain't never put in no work
Pay the price for this sack, and brought me that bird
Clientele on that curb; Cobain, let's work
Triple OG in purp; ghetto gospel; church
Talk to 'em: pulpit; money motivate; fuck bullshit
Flip anything I can get; dedicated to stackin' a grip
They screwface: frustrated cause they ain't have shit

(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
Watch it stack up to the ceiling and buy a house and stash the cash
I'm addicted to the money; some say I came up fast
They should make a movie of my life: Romance for These Cashes
Rubber bands and Ben Franks; they'll never find my stashes
I'm flippin', I'm stackin', she fuckin', she suckin'
I skeeted all in her mouth
I'm smokin', she drinkin', she naked
I'm thinkin' I'ma beat it up on the couch
Money motivate; pussy niggas hate, cause your nigga from the south
You talk shit, but ain't have shit, so you can stick a dick in your mouth
On the road like a trucker; a slick motherfucker
Said her pussy was for sale, but me I'm not a sucker
Countin' up plenty bands; smokin' too many strands
Got straps on deck for you, muhfucka who (?) (?)

(Chorus)
