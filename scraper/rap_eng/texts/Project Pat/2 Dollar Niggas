They get mad and they fuss, they don't shine like us

Project Pat from the street ***, I'm bringin' this heat ***
Never do I back down, don't accept defeat ***
Calico's, bullet holes, gun shells left on site
*** killed over *** or over left and right

Hats cocked, *** pop, quick to have a trigger fit
On a punk trick, knowin' good and well he counterfeit
All you do is talk out'cha mouth, you don't never do
Nothin' that you say out'cha cap, it ain't never true

Bury you, quicker than a *** who done told somethin'
Seen you in the club, beat you down like you owe somethin'
Know, somethin' wrong pistol playa, call you gun show
Real *** mayne, never speak what we don't know

Mayne I got that kush kush, you ain't got nothin'
Mercedes Benz I push push, mayne quit'cha frontin'
Made a fifty thousand dollar stang, *** you's a liar
Fool I'm out here sellin' ***, you needs to retire

You's a Babbage *** seller and a watered down Henn' dranker
I heard you snitched out ya crew, you's a ship sanker
Them hollow points in the *** gonna deal wit'cha
I'll wipe the smile off ya face when the steel hit'cha

2 dollar *** claim they chargin' and playin' ***
But they is out here flaugin' and payin' ***
Nigga you trippin', datin' and meetin' ***
Claimin' you pimpin', savin' and eatin' ***

One day you wearin' red and then it's blue the next
2 dollar *** be the main ones flippin' sets
You say you grippin' techs, regulatin' wit' the torch
Was 25 and you decided to jump off the porch

If he get caught, mouth run hot like broke radiator
Tell about the spots and the plots and the perpetrators
You treat the cops, like ya pops 'cause ya runnin' to 'em
I'm non-stop wit' that Glock, put that gun into him

These older *** put these youngsters on a bloody stage
That's why these young *** get killed at an early age
Sent on a dummy mission from a dummy in a cage
2 dollar leadership will put you in a early grave

Put two dollars in the air for these two dollar ***
Put two dollars in the air for these two dollar ***
Put two dollars in the air for these two dollar ***
