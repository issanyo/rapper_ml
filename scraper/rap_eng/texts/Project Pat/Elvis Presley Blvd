[Intro: Rick Ross]
Hood Billionaire
Nigga need that quinine
I'm makin' more with the bakin' soda, don't hate on me
You know where I'm at though

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the heart
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got Priscilla, I got Priscilla
I got vanilla, boy, I got vanilla
I been that nigga, I been that nigga
I bend that corner, I'm stackin' scrilla

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My face familiar, my face familiar
Half a milli for the whip, this bitch'll hurt your feelings
I could fly Priscilla, send her in the mail
She got Meek Milly cellphone in the county jail
I'm at the car wash off on Elvis Presley BLVD
That needle hit your vein, your ass gon' holla ''good God''
You feel that itch, you feel that itch
That heroin movin' fast, boy, I'm gettin' rich

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Run up in the trap, I push the panic button
Lil' 'Toine snortin' coke, he ain't scared of nothin'
Bumpin' Playa Fly until a player die
Charged 'em for the nine gram, but I gave em five
My bakin' soda fine, I'm bakin' over dimes
I got them brown bags, I bet they know it's mine
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Can I park an airplane in a nigga yard?

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the heart
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
Crushin' them sleepin' pills up, I'm steppin' on the dope
Bringin' down a half a thing, mane, get these puppies off
Hard work pays off, get more if you sellin' soft
Catch you slippin out here though, my dog, we knock yo melon off
Memph-ghanistan, shoot them rifles long like African
Got them young boys shootin' shit up like Africans
Me gold in me mouth, 'round my neck like leprechaun
Lamborghini or Ferrari, watch these bitches come
Stackin' funds off the drugs, me go quick to rob the plugs
Nigga mouth was full of slugs, left these bodies full of slugs
Met me on the south side of the city with the whole thing
Iced 'em with the heater, took his shit, it's a cold game
His niggas know I done it, now it's rumors they want my head
Got my Russian bitch sleepin' with me right in the bed
My niggas killin' about this shit, for reallin' about this shit
Fuck around and get a hundred years, dawg, about this shit

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the dog food, the soft nigga and the hard
You can tell them crackers they can go and get the dogs
I'm ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Ridin' down Elvis Presley BLVD
Got the boy, got the girl and I got the heart
Tell them pussy crackers they can bring the dogs
Bring the dogs
They can bring the dogs
Go get the dogs
Go bring the dogs
Go bring the dogs
Go bring the dogs
Go get your dogs
Go get your dogs
