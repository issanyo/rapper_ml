[Hook]
We gon drink, we gon ride
We gon smoke and get high
Smoke and get high, smoke and get high

[Verse 1 - Project Pat]
Hypnotize camp got a answer for you hoes
Inhale the weed blow the smoke out your nose
Crack open bottles of that liquor, pour it in
Gonna take a swallow of that vodka and gin
Hoes making cheese off of tricks who'll spend
Up all they money, ho you gotta check em in
Game recognize, eyes lit like a match
Blaze up this fire, paranoid like on crack
Riding with my dogs, dodging laws when we roll
Through the Dixie Homes me and Toby on a stroll
See a short skirt and we looking for a ho
One that'll suck dick, one that'll go
Coward ass niggas get wrong and we blast
Never knowing who always wear a mask
Talking that smack, then reach in the stash
Dumping them slugs then mash on the gas
[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Crunchy Black]
All I do is smoke on bud
Break the Swisher down, nigga, fill it up with drugsRiding through your neighborhood with my cuz
Looking for us a freaky little slut
Found us a slut, so we pick the bitch up
Smoking on that 'dro, nigga, pouring in her cup
This bitch right here know she gotta fuck
Fucked me, mane, and she sucking on my cuz
Fill her up with X, mane, we don't give a fuck
Get this little freaky bitch for some drugs
Do her ass in, mane, smoking on that 'dro
Breaking down the weed, mane, smoking up some mo'
Broke out the powder on this freaky ho
Let me see: how far will this ho go?
Stick dick down all in her bootyhole
Mane, this a freaky ass-fucking ho!

[Hook]
We gon drink, we gon ride
We gon smoke and get high
Smoke and get high, smoke and get high

[Verse 3 - Project Pat]
This is a weed session
You need to take out the seeds, yes sir
The kind of dope that we like to smoke
The red hairs get you high, you choke
We gonna break down in bags, sack up
We chain-smokers taking drags, no slack up
Then take shots of that liquor intox-o-
Cated mane, hand on trigga, let it blow
I go insane iffin' I don't get 'dro
Dog I ain't paying for no bab a: hell no
I'm low on ends, so I turn into leech
I might go smoke all your shit then hit streets
You look around and you could be victim
"Hey you got five on a bag?" Done tricked him!
He thinking Project was cool, you damn fool
Mane I got Memphis in my blood, I cross too
