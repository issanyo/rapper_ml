[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Make dat ass clap make it snap (talk to me now)
Make dat ass smack when I slap (talk to me now)
If you is the baddest booty the phatest
Let me hear you holla out I yi yi

[verse 1]
Its ya boy P-A-Tza knowin pat'll please her
Hit from the back cuz these gals off the heeza
Bend ova or stroke it yo butt gets a pokin
The hydro is smokin theres nutt in ya throatin
Yo booty is floatin all round the rooma
My thang full of gin so dat puddy is dooma
Assume the position mug in the pillow
Hand on the head bow best not to let go
Hand may a slippin head gets a crackin

A doggin a slappin my thang in yo stomach
Now move 4 we drank cuz youz bout to vomit

[verse 2]
Its gold mouth stackin dollars
Where yo sista at cuz she swallors
Big juicy fat I must hollars
See you in yo pants I may foll'her
Wearin tight clothes make yall scholars
Freaky yung broads that luv ballers
Hesitate to talk nigga stallers
You can let the steam out yo collar
Luv gettin stuck on 4 hours
Ja-cu-zie livin room showers
Nipples on hard some big knockers
Eyes got bigga than blue blockers
Coochie real tight like school lockers
Treat a lame dude like a true socka
Most gonna pay cuz they luv her
Dog anyway I will knock her

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[verse 3]
There she go there she go with them g's and strings
My nigga dont you know she will do some things
Droppin that to the flo bendin knees and bows
Poke it out let it hang then touch ya toes
Never shame in her game its just like a bitch
She will suck on dat thang like some lick-a-rich
It'll snap crackle pop call me captain crunch
Got me balled in a knot eat me up fa lunch
That bootys a big'n good fa dat hittin
Thick like a rhino can do a splittin
You'll get a stickin like in a flickin
Hit the right spot and cum start drippin
A flirtin a skirtin a weaver a dirt'n
You screamin to stop I'm showin no mercy
Wake up kinda early ya breath smeelin perky
You try kissin me and you needin a cert'n

[Chorus]
