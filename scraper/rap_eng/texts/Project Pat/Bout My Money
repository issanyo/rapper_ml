[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Ooh, I just copped the BMW
Oh you ain't gon' speak, ok no freak, I ain't gon' choke you
Kush blunting star, inside peanut butter
Grey yola paint, chrome rims gon' make ya heart flatter
AC like a blizzard, Icy chains like a [?]
[?] silver apartment
Pull up Escalate, 22's [?]
She rolled up a blunt, that's the purple stuff sparking
These young niggas retarded
They’re arguing in my city, fool
Cool like a pop sickle
Strapped with the Glock pistol
Money in the garbage bag
Louis gucci duffle bags

[Hook: V Slash]
Holla at me

Don't be mad at me
Cuz I'm bout my money

Holla at me

[Verse 2: V Slash]
I'ma hustle til I die, like my homie Juicy J
[?] really not the way for me to go out
I gotta be straight
On the street with Project Pat I never thought I see the day
And Imma keep it real wit cha, he the reason why I’m shining
Savy Slash grinding
“it brought me to the limelight”
Folks tried to have me
23 on me, locked me down
[?] signed me
I'm still independent, but I got my own company
Phone blowing up, its my [?] she wanna fuck with me
Told her its some [?] end of discussion
[?] Bout my money

[Hook: V Slash]
Holla at me

Don't be mad at me
Cuz I'm bout my money

Its bout my money
Don't be mad at me
