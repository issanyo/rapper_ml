(Intro, Project Pat)
Yeah, niggas seein' me
Mad at me cause I'm ridin the thirties on the damn thang
Ya know I'm sayin?
Nigga mad at me, wanna shoot me
Cause they baby-mama wanna holla at me
Nigga it's a free enterprise out here too
And to you niggas out here talkin bout
"mayn, sell me somethin for the lo-lo"
Mayn, I ain't sellin you niggas nothin for the lo-lo!
I already sold you niggas somethin for the lo-lo!
Nigga, its dry out here
I'm tryin'a double up, huddle up
You know I'm sayin?
They can hate my swag, whatever!

(Hook, Project Pat)
You can catch me in the Chevy or the drop-top Jag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
The best purp' in the town, playa gon' take a drag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
A hundred G's off trappin dogg, I ain't tryin'a brag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
Big guns in my pockets, keep my pants on sag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag

(Verse 1, Project Pat)
Haters tellin' want me locked up
In a pine-box
Got rocks and my partner watch
Say I sell rocks
Pullin up on these whores
To the car, they gon' run
Lime gauge got me stickin out
Like a sore thumb
Niggas dumb, see they got mad
Cause I bought the ball
Quarter-brick, bought the Crown Vic'
Chrome on the car
Sweetest plugs on our drugs
You can call me snow flurry
Everythang for the low mang
But'chu better hurry
Heard a drought was comin to the hood (Cut-off the lights)
Trap open, niggas mad, cause I (Jacked-up the price)
Don't be hatin on me
Cause you punks'd do me
That's why I'ma do you
Nigga what'chu wan' do?

(Hook)
You can catch me in the Chevy or the drop-top Jag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
The best purp' in the town, playa gon' take a drag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
A hundred G's off trappin dogg, I ain't tryin'a brag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
Big guns in my pockets, keep my pants on sag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag

(Verse 2)
Patty-cake, patty-cake
Stackin money on the plate
And I'm filled with neo-mind
You gon' make me beat the brakes
Off you boys, bring the noise
Smoke ya like a kush-bubble
I'm the president of drama
Guess you got some Bush trouble
Haters huddle up, plottin up
Cause they broke niggas
Kidnap a punk, cut his throat
Call 'em croak niggas
Sick, cause I got that thirty inches on the Hummer ride
Mad, cause I killed yo parter and I beat the homicide
Yo broad say she dont want no lame, she want a hood nigga
One got a brain, flip them thangs, lay it wood nigga
I'd take a L, but I maintain, wish ya could nigga
Wanna jone me, like a game? All good nigga

(Hook)
You can catch me in the Chevy or the drop-top Jag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
The best purp' in the town, playa gon' take a drag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
A hundred G's off trappin dogg, I ain't tryin'a brag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag
Big guns in my pockets, keep my pants on sag
Niggas hate my swag, niggas hate my swag

(Repeat to fade)
Niggas hate my, hate my, haters hate my swag
