(Project Pat)
The pain is what, I'll bring it to you dawg
No love for those, who ain't about there hog
The script has flipped and Hypnotized has came
Cause we the crew are rich off in the game
The hood is hard like cotton pickin day
We breakin law just like we bayin slaves
We blaze and ride my mouth it fool of gold's
We sell the snow we also kick in do's
The murder rate increases to the full
The 'dro is passed after I take a pull
I'm hustlin sun up until sun down
A pharmacist wit client out on the town
We wild just like the gorillas in the zoo
If you fo weed then I'ma fuck wit you
Retaliation nigga it's a must
Don't get too close the rugers they will bust

(chorus)
(Project Pat)
I'm the main nigga on these bricks who don't give a fuck
If I had to rob a trick or a armored tuck
Lay it down don't you make a sound or I shall unload
Face the ground fo I buck you down project ain't no hoe
To the rule of society heavy in this shit
Slang chan standing on my feet playa I'm da nigga
Who could say when the bullets spray that I won't get hit
That's the change my nigga strapped with extra clip
Projo in and come in to blast lookin through the mask
Full of gin question neva ask murder is the task
Poppin lead till I empty the whole magazine
To yo head tryin to chop it off like a guillotine
Costing me and you know I cant except a loss
In the M we like to get high and we like to cross
Who's the boss is the man standing round the chock line
Growin old with his wife and kids didn't do time

(chorus)
(Project Pat)
Keep a trick and it ain't a hoe know dat I ain't a hoe
Pull the triga back aI'm fo dome crush a cantalo upe
Kill em by my weaponry
Man I got no preferences
Nothing but some bullets fo you punks with discrepancy
Conflicts bully shit anna and I hateraed
Don't be talking crazy to me hoe cause I ain't your bitch
Convict busten head with a heart neva scared
Quick to pull a chesten o will shoot the fuckin lead
Police think they can get some
Drunk and strapped with a gun
You can see what I'm bout
They goin to have to take me out
Chill nigga keep it chill weak niggas fake the deal
Goin out to goin out to do some shit, hesitation got em kill
Worried bout consequence, worried bout the witnesses
Put a mask on go'n in and do the shit
Tell the nigga chop it off, make the suckas give ya some
Take the goody good, don't just stand there nigga run
