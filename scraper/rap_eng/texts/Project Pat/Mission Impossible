L attention in the world today
All the little girls fillin up the world today
When good comes to bad the bad comes to good
But im gonna live a life like I should
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Shit can ever did it
Because they don't get
But I'll stay fitted
Knew there committed
Unless this red cap
Gets a bad rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry? (gotta cry)
Do we always gotta be inside a lie (a lie)
Life is just a blast
Movin very fast
Better stay on top
Or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid
So what you wanna do?
The way you wanna run
When your starin down a cable
Of a mic put it that you grill like a gun
Limp Bizkit is rockin the set
Its like Russian Roulette
When your placin your bet
So don't be upset
When your broke
And your done
Cuz im gonna be the one
Til I jet

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Now you wanna hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Now you wanna hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me

Does anybody really know the secret
And the combination for this life and where they keep it
Its kinda sad when you don't know the meaning
But everything happens for a reason
I don't even know what I should say
Im an idiot a loser and a phone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beaten on my mind every second with my fist

Everybody wanna run (run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun (gun)
You can take that ride through this life if you want
You can't take that edge off that knife (no sir)
And now you want your money back (money back)
But your denied cuz your brains fried from the sac
And there ain't nothing I can do
Cuz life is a lesson you'll learn it when your through

I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
I know why you want to hate me
I know why you want to hate me
Now I know why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Why you want to hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Now you wanna hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me

(Now I know why..Now I know why..Now I know why)

Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Now I know why you wanna hate me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
Cuz hate is all the world that's even seen me
