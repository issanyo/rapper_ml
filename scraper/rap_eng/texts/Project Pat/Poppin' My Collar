Now every since I can remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I can remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand

[Project Pat]
I know you sicker than sick-ahh
When you see the rims flick-ahh
The paint drip off
Ice in my rangs glitt-ahh
I straight flippa
The cheese like pancake-ahh
Fallin' from trees like the leaves
In my hand break-ahh
Project Pat-ahh
Attracted to dime pieces
I'm dirty southern
French braids, gold teeth
I'm out here makin' sense
Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars
I keep a bad broad, dawg
And a popped collar

[Hook]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Ever since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand


[DJ Paul]
Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery
A lot of dudes swear they playin', man they some fakery
Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site
And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight
I'm tryin' to get paid however money is made
A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid
But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow
Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model, for real

[Juicy J]
Well you know me by the Juice man hangin out with Big Triece
Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin
It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up
If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up

[Hook]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand


[Crunchy Black]
She's just another ho that I met in the hood
I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good
She might as well go on head and suck on my wood
And let me whisper something in her ear if I could
I got some hoes out there bringin ya boy back some good
That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood
Ain't havin to shout at no motherfuckin slut
You know I'm actin bitch make cut a fuckin rug
You better get out there and get my money in the woods
I'mma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug
You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what
These hoes out here be fucking for a muthafucking dub, FREAK BITCH!

[Hook]
Now every since I could remember I been poppin' my collar
Poppin', poppin' my collar, poppin', poppin' my collar
Every since I could remember I been working these hoes
And they better put my money in my hand
