And you know a lot of you niggas went to jail and caught charges and shit
Because you didn't keep your own god damn mouth shut ya know
You got to keep your mouth shut mane
You might go home see its like
One thing about the system mane
They can't convict you, they don't have a strong conviction
They feel like they don't have a strong conviction
They not gonna, they not gonna pursue the case
So you know even though you know you might have saw the body
And you might even shot that gun
If you know, you don't admit to nothing
They may come to you with even less time
And you might come out instead of a life sentence know what I'm sayin'
I mean what you niggas got to do is

You niggas tell em shit 'cause you scared, 'cause they scared you up
If your heart ain't in this shit mane, then don't get in this shit
That's just the best way to do it, that's what niggas told me when I was growing up
