[Hook: Project Pat]
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O's

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Break a whole thang down to O-o's
Pull up on you, serve yo' ass on the low-low
Too many hustle, too much money for me to go broke
Put on that mask, and put them 40's to your thro-oat
Came up in the struggle, some niggas rob, some niggas hustle
Dope don't always sell itself, use your brain, that's your muscle
Stay about paper, fuck the rest
Get your cheese, fuck the stress
Fuck what you goin' through, if you got money you gon' pass the test
The gas straight from Northern Cali
Came up servin' beans in the alley
Pull up, foreign whips at the palace
Dirk Nowitzki plays plug from Dallas

[Hook: Project Pat]
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O's

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
I came up off them O's
Good weed, that's all I smoke
Hit it twice, you gonna choke
Stuff it down your bitch throat until that bitch choke
I ain't never had shit, had to learn how to hustle
Went and got a plug and took all of them nigga customers
I got strong, I got the best
Fuck all the rest and I trap with that TEC
Took all the customers, ran up a check
My shit the strongest, no flex
Sold your bitch half an ounce, got some head but no sex
Gold Rollie, Gold Cubans, they ask me how I do it
Nigga you must be stupid!

[Hook: Project Pat]
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O-o-o-o's
Hustlin' grams and them O-o-o-o's
Break them thangs down to O-o-o-o's
Servin' nuthin but them O-o-o-o's
I came up off them O's
