[Hook: x2]
Papers n cups, papers n cups
Give me some kush and some drink and I'm a fill it up
Papers n cups, papers n cups
Got my kush, got my drink, I'm getting fucked up

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Yella drank in my cup, purple haze and my papers
Kobe Bryant swag, you can call this here the Lakers
Birthday candle lit and you lames better not blow it
A nigga got that drink around packed, you better throw it
Trippy sticks and trippy cups, 2 bitches at the same time now that's a trippy fuck
I'm smoking on this grass who came from the earth
Ballin on you niggas ass like a nerf
These hoes getting high, then they getting low
Needin her life bill paid, her knees hit the floor
Oh my golly on that moly she's a sexy dolly
Ran through her pussy like some tracks, my dick the trolly

Papers n cups, papers n cups
Give me some kush and some drink and I'm a fill it up
Papers n cups, papers n cups
Got my kush, got my drink, I'm getting fucked up

[Verse 2: Nasty Mane]
Get me some trippy papers and some trippy cups
Mix that Sprite with that lean damn throw it up
This that Audemar house and we get fucked
Smoke nothing but Cali weed, you know the A+
This that Cheech & Chong, that can fuck our merzy
I'm a drug addict, I'm talkin everyday use this
Plenty weed smoking, plenty weed pourin
Plenty molly poppin, we love them girs peep poppin
If she throw it back, we gon throw that cash
It ain't nothing but some money, bandz will make her dane
If she throw it back, we gon throw that cash
It ain't nothing but some money, bandz will make her dane
