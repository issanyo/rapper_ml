[Hook: Juicy J]
I get that money and throw it up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
We going up, we going up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Just got a call, it might be your bitch
Tryna hit the bong, tryna bond, sure she blowing up my iPhone 6
Always gotta smile, my spirit stay rich
I'm focused on the love, the haters don't exist
But shit get hard, I really must admit
So I stay on my grind, away from the bullshit
Take another dab, blow this smoke out like it's hookah
You want a computer, shit is real

[Hook: Juicy J]
I get that money and throw it up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
We going up, we going up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I stay posted in the sky, shitting on them like a bird
Mad cause I block their calls, ratchets get on my nerves
Scratch my Forgi's on the curb so I bought another car
'Bout to pour me up some drinks, and shots on me at the bar
Ain't no way I ever stop, my next door neighbour's Augustus
My bitch coming straight from Venus, my kush coming straight from Mars
You know all we blow is loud, we flex with the check and ball
Holding heavy metal, you would think a nigga play guitar

[Hook: Juicy J]
I get that money and throw it up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
We going up, we going up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
I remember days when a nigga couldn't blaze nothing J
Locked down in a cell dog, I was 10 hours away
From this day, niggas balling when he out this bitch
Gucci, Louis down, fresh to death like a casket
Pass the shit, inhaling green, I'm in the lab like
Baby mama head in my lap, getting her mind right
Slow head like for show bread, I ain't worried about nothin'
Used to be worried 'bout fighting these cases, now I'm worried 'bout stuntin'

[Hook: Juicy J]
I get that money and throw it up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
We going up, we going up in the sky
Get that KK weed and blow it up in the sky
Got a condo out in Beverley Hills up in the sky
Number one on the charts, we going up in the sky
