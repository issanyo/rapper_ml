[Hook: x2]
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
I don't wanna have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
All I wanna do is eat, all I wanna do is eat

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Do I really have to hurt me a nigga, dirt me a nigga?
T-shirt one of you niggas, murk me a nigga
Bullet through your chest, open heart surgery
Calling on god, like you the clerg-er-y
Baby mama played me all day, you never heard of me
Still ain't hearin shots in yo house, burglary
Tippy toe, 2 miss, Glock 42 clips
But kill for them pesos but not no hoes
Have you read the paper? Have you seen the news?
Choppa like magician, turn yo flesh into ooze
Now they screamin "ooh" , what the hell he do?
Quit speakin on my business bitch, you gon gets me do

[Hook: x2]
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
I don't wanna have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
All I wanna do is eat, all I wanna do is eat

[Verse 2: Nasty Mane]
Ya'll gon make have to burn me a nigga
Put the ruger to his brain, learn me a nigga
Straighten his ass out, big pun me a nigga
Concerned about the money, not concerned about no nigga
Bust a choppa, hey ya come with a kick stand
We got the masks round our face like we Taliban
He got some shit on his chest, call him Superman
Them shots laid his as down, he want Superman
I kidnapped your bitch like I'm King Cooper man
Them bullets like ex laps, runnin through you man
No NBA but I got them shooters man
We like mackin no reason, look we'll just do you man

[Hook: x2]
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
I don't wanna have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
Ya'll gon make me have to
Burn me a nigga, burn me a nigga
All I wanna do is eat, all I wanna do is eat
