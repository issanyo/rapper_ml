[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I grew up on the [?] projects
Nigga throw your gangsign, nigga where ya mob at
Disrespect we gon' smash your face like a car wreck
Nigga learned violence and learned to compile a pyrex
As a school boy I was always skipping class
[?] smokin' out the glass
Name brand shoes and some pants on my ass
Had a good momma, that stayed on my ass
And I thank god for my family
Not too many presents under the tree, but we family
Poverty made us have unity
Lil cous used to hang with me and got shot down in the street
Niggas they have love for me couldn't tell
We pullem in the ground now none of you niggas where there
And I still I see you niggas
And it's still fuck you niggas

[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm screaming motherfuck you niggas
I'm screaming motherfuck you niggas
The lord say forgive ya, but I ain't fucking witcha
I'm screaming motherfuck you niggas
It's still motherfuck you niggas
I keep my hand on the trigger, cause I ain't fucking witcha

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
In the club from highschools in my class
VIP, gold bottles bitches poppin' ass
Picture with an autograph
I ain't Andre 3000 but the bitch treated me like a outcast
But  still took the picture and I signed the motherfucker
I'm a rich nigga not a better motherfucker
Now I'm riding foreign whips, domestic bitches wanna roll
Slammin' pussy holes like basketball
But I do not never trust you bitches
Keep my mind focused stay in on my riches
And my hand on the trigger
Cause it's still fuck you niggas

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I used to hang with this nigga more than my blood brother
[?] like we had the same mother
Undercover this nigga worser than the devil
Prosecutor tried to bury me this nigga, he the shovel
Sittin' on a witness stand dawg, they don't understand
Tryna help these people take my license 'posed to be my man
Got out the cail and came up
Heard you and your mama moved
Cause you [?] bra

[Hook 2: Project Pat]
I would never lay a hand on you
You was my motherfucking nigga
You was my motherfucking nigga
I used to wanna kill ya, but nigga I forgive ya
You wasn't strong like me nigga
You wasn't built like me nigga
The lord say forgive ya, but I ain't fucking witcha
