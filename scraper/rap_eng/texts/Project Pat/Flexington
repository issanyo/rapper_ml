[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Mane I'm rollin' through the city on these forgiato skinnies
Chiefing bubble gum loud with a pint of that henny
Haters I got plenty
Bitches lookin' breaking they necks
I got TV Johnny gold on my neck, so I flex
Got this pretty yellow bone wanna take me on a date
Cause her nigga at the crib
He keep on coming in late
That's your bitch need to get her
Cause I hate to have to drop her
Zero tolerance for niggas wanna trip about a bopper
Couldn't stop her, if you wanted to
Ho gon' be a ho
She would never leave this pimpin' if you payed her to go
I'm just ridin' makin' plays
Gettin' bread off the scale
Blow this loud in your face, mane you lames can go to hell

[Hook]
I'm flexin' so hard in the street, they call me Flexington
Flexington, Flexington, Flexington, Flexington
I'm flexin' too hard in the street, they call me Flexington
Flexington, Flexington, Flexington, Flexington

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I just sold me a quarter pack
Blowin' on a quarter sack
You other niggas speak these lies
Project Pat just spit the facts
Turnin' hundreds into racks
Chrome on the cadillac
Your bitch done set out the dome
Let me hit it from the back
If I'm flapped police a be wasting they time
Need to be somewhere doing the job out here solving the crime
No more time for a player
I'm just getting to the biz-a-ness
Catch me on Rodeo in LA spending grizz-a-ness
OG got my mind spin-ni-nin', I'm just grin-ni-nin'
Laughing at you losers money train game win-ni-nin'
I'm from Tennessee, but I got homies in Lexington
Who got them foreign rides just like me
Flexington
