[Verse 1: French Montana]
Long as it look good, Montana i be in
Ain't talking about no money, Montana get offended
Every minute of the hour smoking sour, drinking Henney
Head spinning, all the problems got me smoking like a chimney
Homie that paranoia, got me gripping on that semi
Now I'm trying to make a dolla but evrybody screaming "give me"
Im focused on that jacpot, homie fuck their feelings
I be yelling fuck the industry, my niggas they be dealing
Its like a full time job on these niggas, not to kill them
You know a nigga swag, like one in a million
I be yelling fuck the hardtop, screaming through the ceiling
Fucking the baddest hoes, getting money, nigga chilling
Montana!

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Yes sir!!
Im smoking weed and staying high
And popping pills and drinking vodka
Making money, spending money, fucking bitches thats my options
Louis bag, satchel bag, filled with a lot of cash
Strip club, yes I do, chicks with a lot of ass
You see me riding in the phantom need to call the cab
Cause she were talking bout no pussy so I left her ass
She got a look like Halle Berry maybe Stacey Dash
Cause errytime you see me, nigga, I'm with something bad
And I smell like money, look like money
Nigga I ain't going down, like you crash dummies
Niggas hating cause they know they ain't got nu'in
You can't walk it like you talking, you ain't got nu'in

[Hook: French Montana]
Nigga do it, do it

Nigga do it, do it, nigga do it, nigga do it, nigga do it, nigga do it Don't rap about it do it


[Verse 3: Project Patta]
My money rising high, like a ceiling
The hood niggas posted every corner like a wall green
Errybody hustlin from New York [?]
Down in North Memphis stolen guns out their van
I'm the man, cause I choose to get up from my anus
[?] pistol trigger to your head, I can make you brainless
You can[?]
Dis ain't 1930 but niggas still singing blues
Seven hard times still selling coca hard
Somebody dropped the stank bomb now thats a smokers fart
[?] coming back to back
I don't just talk about it dawg, I live that
