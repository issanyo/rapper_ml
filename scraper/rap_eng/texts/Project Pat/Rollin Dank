You know I'm tryna chill with you
You know you tryna chill with me
You tryna fuck up in with me, so baby why you playin'
I'm tryna roll this dank with you
Sip this purple pint with you
I'm rolling up this dank with you, so ain't no time to wait
You tryna see what's good with me
You tryna hit my hood with me
You gon' roll this wood with me, so baby why you playin'
You know I'm tryna chill with you
I know you tryna chill with me
You know I'm tryna build with you, so ain't no time to wait

Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, what the fuck you think

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Purple drank, blowing purple stank, I don't smoke no cheap
California loud in my possession, ain't no smoke for free
You could be a nigga next to kin, I'm still charging  em
Any bitch who ain't my bitch, I'm robbing em
I'm just tryna count my money, smoke my weed up
While I'm gettin' head, blowin' gas, kick my feet up
All these hoes thirsty, they need a cactus
Bend that ass over, put your face in my mattress
While I long stroke, the pussy hole
These bitches think that, they pussy gold
Sexy ass bitch, but you know that I don't trust her
I just blew a blunt with her, and then I fucked her
Niggas like catching charges over bitches
Relationship and shit  like a geenie and some wishes But I ain't here wishing getting to the trippas
I ain't from L.A, but I ball like the Clippers

You know I'm tryna chill with you

You know I'm tryna build with you, so ain't no time to wait

Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, rollin', rollin' dank
Rollin' dank, sippin' purple pint, what the fuck you think

[Verse 2: Big Trill]
She, the roller
The girls been bowling 10 door, we control her
She a bird, fuck and suck gluce
I tap on her head like its duck duck goose
I bagged her in the pickup, now she mad I don't pick up
I just fucked that's a fact, I'm like a 2 strap prada no strings attached
Baby I don't feel your feelings, only in yo mouth I can feel yo feelings
Convertible got a illin'
Sky is the limit, I can drop the ceiling
She said I'm acting funny
You see this Rolex, time is money
Later on I get into her
Put it under her tongue, I check her temperature
