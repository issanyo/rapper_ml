[Hook: Coca Vango]
I keep that 30 like Steph, I keep that 30 like Steph

[Verse 1: Young MA]
I keep that 30 like Curry
I keep that 40 like bonds
Nine on me, Iguodala
I keep calm but I'm on
Snake niggas in the grass
Make the chopper mow the lawn
I'm chase a chicken, make a chicken
I'm Old Mcdonald on the farm
In the club shooting movies
My G's with me, word to Gucci
Stripper bitches being freaky, shooting water out the coochie
Booty, booty, booty, rocking everywhere
Pussy, pussy, pussy, popping everywhere
That's that pocket rocket, got it everywhere

[Hook: Coca Vango]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
There's 30 on the chopper and 30 on the clip
30 on the wrist nigga, 30 on the heels
Eat your banana peel, nigga don't slip
(?) or bang like a blood or a crip
The pack in my hand disappear, make it poof
Head of this hustling, you know you a hoof
Still in the Chevy, I'm foreign or coupe
Took all your money and sold you some ooouuu
Saucing and bossing, fresh like in coffin
You ain't got my money? Get murdered for crossing
That's how the money stay flipping like dolphins
These hoes gonna keep bout 30 dicks in they jaws and
Pussy stay hot just like down there in New Orleans
I'm standing on stacks, I ain't tryna be falling
Pata, I'm standing on stacks, I ain't tryna be falling, oh

[Hook: Coca Vango]
I keep that 30 like Steph, I keep that 30 like Steph

And I just step in Giuseppes, I can do it by myself
I get my bitch from Brazil, I get my Gucci from Philips
I keep that 30 on me, I keep that 30 on me
I keep that 30 on me, I keep that 30 on me
I keep that 30 on me, I keep that 30 on me
I keep that 30 on me, I keep that 30 on me

[Verse 3: Big Trill]
Shooting like Steph off the back board
I'll put your brains on your dashboard
30 shots hit you from long range
No evidence for the task force
Pull up in the foreign, they (?) me
I got your bitch on my ballsack
Pushing a button to park that
Fresh off the lot, fuck the Car Facts
Might fuck her once and don't call back
Riding around with extendos
Pushing keys like I'm Timbo
Went through shits, don't get sinful
Chopper sound like a bass drum
Certified bitch, I'm A1
And I got the (?)
Bitch I keep it trill with my day ones

[Hook: Coca Vango]
