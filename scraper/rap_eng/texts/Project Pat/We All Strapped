If you got a issue we can solve that
Pocket check homie I want all that
[?] tell em fall back
Team full of thugs and we all strapped
We all strapped, we all strapped
Team full of thugs and we all strapped
We all strapped, we all strapped
Team full of thugs and we all strapped

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Gotta get up off ya ass, get the cash like you hold some
Never ask a nigga let you hold some
.45 holster
When you get a paper plenty, niggas try to harm ya
Players in the game, hated by the bench warmers
Said this shit is normal
What goes around comes around, mothafuck karma
I'ma let it rip on a nigga I can slip on
Lean and the sprite, I'ma sip up
And but, if what, should have, would have, could have, nah
Better safe than sorry, fake niggas they be fooling y'all
I'ma start schooling y'all
Class is in session
Get yo pen and paper out, I'ma teach you lesson
Waking up to see another day is a blessing
Another day to hustle, I minimize the stressin'
Everything happening for a reason, no question
The man of the bud, lay your faith in the weapon

Team full of thugs and we all strapped
We all strapped, we all strapped
Team full of thugs and we all strapped
We all strapped, we all strapped
Team full of thugs and we all strapped

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Man I swear that 9 bust loud but AK even louder
Bitch I got respect, got the money and the power
Purple in the Styrofoam, swisher full of sour
Man I'm geeked up like Montana on that power
Nigga get it twisted, money never change me
Its the foreign cars, foreign broads, got em angry
Louis be and Gucci, only homie I'm the same me
Colder than a polar bear, harder than a [?]
I just turn a money counter, only watch it add up
Too much money in my pocket, duffle bag up
Everything I say is facts nigga I can back it up
Your bitch fuck with real niggas
Or beat a bitch down might as well call me [?]
Tired of these niggas claiming street but they not though
Put a .40 to
