[Hook: Project Pat]
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Always blowing gas, sip Promethazine
Plays off the hood, bitch I do my thing
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Smoking purple, green, sippin' purple lean

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Raised into hell, plenty drug sales
Best friend leave yo ass hanging like a coat tail
Got it on my own, got it out the dirt
Hustlin' work, catch a sucker slippin', lay his ass to the curb
All a nigga know is all a nigga seen
Real niggas keep their business on low, get the green
Like a basketball coach, have to organize a team
Have to get their mind together, have to organize a dream
Smoking gassy, suckers never ever get a passy
I got Pitbull hustle, you broke niggas Lassie
And you bitches sassy but your pussy nasty
I'm a hood nigga but this Ghost make me classy

[Hook: Project Pat]
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Always blowing gas, sip Promethazine
Plays off the hood, bitch I do my thing
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Smoking purple, green, sippin' purple lean

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Got it out the mud, like to buy em all boots
Got this jazzy little bitch, like to blow me like a flute
All that sloppy in my lap, bitch don't get that on my suit
In that black Rolls Royce, I be whippin' like Roots
Hope my name ain't Toby, I been ballin' out like Kobe
I been pimpin' like I'm Goldie, I spent 90 on a Rollie
One time still patrolling, where I grew up at?
And this rap game filthy as a sewer rat
But fuck that, let's talk money, everybody speak that language
You got it bad but it could be worse so nigga stop complaining
I went from riding city buses now I'm private planing
Juicy J and Project Pat, [?]
Let's get this money nigga

[Hook: Project Pat]
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Always blowing gas, sip Promethazine
Plays off the hood, bitch I do my thing
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Got it out the mud like a pint of lean
Smoking purple, green, sippin' purple lean
