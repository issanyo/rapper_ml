[Chorus]
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your auntie, to your cousin, to your mother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your daddy, lil' sister, and your brother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
If I don't get caught, I'm a rich motherfucka

[Verse 1]
Out here slangin' in the trap, all these junkies want is butta
Selling to the old niggas, young niggas and their mothers
That girl make your heart flutter, but this bowl gon' make you stutter
Oh damn, drippin' like a ship with a steady rudder, dead butta
Got her bangin' on my window bangin' on my door
You ain't gotta know us so junkies find you for that dough
My Russian bitch'll squirt and try to rhyme she don't bust
Mixing Caribbean butter up fuck some brick dust
Selling [?] oh they call the brick a butta
You eat [?] to the fans so don't be a rich motherfucker
This money bringin' power take no shit, I'm no sucker
On this AK like some KK smoke yo ass motherfucker

[Chorus]
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your auntie, to your cousin, to your mother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your daddy, lil' sister, and your brother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
If I don't get caught, I'm a rich motherfucka

[Verse 2]
Slangin' butter, slangin' butter dog night and day
Cut two ounce for my nigga on South Park way
It was a setup, better get read up cause the plug gon be pissed
Niggas mommas niggas grannies man they gon be missed
This full of money counting all of these 20, junkies sick
Nigga tried to take, shut him in his talker
Down in Memphis we was hustlin pills, peanut butter in them seals
If your partner (name?) in this shit that nigga don't squeal
For real

[Chorus]
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your auntie, to your cousin, to your mother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
To your daddy, lil' sister, and your brother
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
Slangin' butta, slangin' butta, slangin' butta
If I don't get caught, I'm a rich motherfucka
