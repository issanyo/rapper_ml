[Verse 1: MI$FITxAPOLLO]

I'm a stone cold killa like
Stone cold nigga stick him up
Hit him up with the 44 nigga
Leave that nigga on the ground
That floor cold nigga Outkast
No brain like no dome nigga
Uh stick em up stick em stick
Em up stick em up break em
Ak47 in the trunk I'll spray
That phonky shit 275 shit wanna
Be alive bitch sit down and die
Bitch  ole lollipop ass niggas
All y'all just a bunch of licks
Your girl sucked on my dick and
You kissed her on the lips I knew
Y'all were fake from start that's
Why I sit at the park and scream
Fuck niggas in the club parking
Lot let the propane spark no name
In this game so I bring the pain
Ha I'm in the penatintary screaming
Free boosie shooting at tires on the
Cars while they moving oowee your
Girlfreind got a stank coochie get
The body bag homey cause I'm bout
To stunt just some little ass kids
Running round with guns so you
Better watch out cause they shoot
For fun they just some drug dealing
Criminals this shit ain't fun so watch
Out lil nigga you better run
(better watch out nigga this sh*t ain't fun)

[Verse 2: MI$FITxAPOLLO]

Call me brotha man from the
Fifth floor sneak into your
Window 16 Trynna spit flows
Used to wear the same clothes
Now its gold Jordan's like
Retro coming out that 30 wanna
Drive a Benzo seems like I
Can't though always looked
Down on and I'm still staying
Strong niggas out there
Smoking dope wasting there
Life though walk in' round
With there eyes low me I got
Hella flows spitting like I
Got braces on may be a weirdo
But your homegirl still love
Me though yea I'm out here
Gettin' dough I gotta take
This serious kicking flows
Like a villian we shootin'
Up your buildings someone
Please save the children
(Uh, Yeah)
