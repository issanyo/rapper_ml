[Juicy J]
Yessir North North! Yeah Project Pat 'bout to hip you
Niggas to some real shit... how he used to do it back
In the day... that mask and that muhfuckin' pistol...
What that nigga went to jail fo' on some real real shit

[Chorus]
I was wild wit' that pis-tol in the streets
Tryna make a killin' off of coke and weed
You know how we get, down, you know how we get, down
You know how we get, down, you know how we get, down
I was wild wit' that pis-tol in the streets
Tryna make a killin' off of coke and weed
You know how we get, down, you know how we get, down
You know how we get, down, you know how we get, down

[Verse 1]
They knew them K's, was blazin', they knew they couldn't, phaze him
Roll through not to, get chasin', look for prey, to slay 'em
That's what we out, here doin', Hardy boy heads, we bruisin'
Resist and you'll, be losin', murder was the, conclusion
Flossin' and flaugin' wit' flags, Hit you wit' autos and mags
Run up on this here, you'll crash, and we ain't wearin' no mask
Strange to us, an al-i-en, warrin' like it's ray-le-on
You, got reputa-ti-on, dog you needs to pay me some
Cars, it ain't no savin' 'em, broads, we out here playin' 'em
Un-til that, we go to jail, then we wanna stay wit' 'em
Kept, the hydro fired up, coca kept us wired up
If you is a shaky guy, you don't wanna ride wit' us

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I had cheeeese, dope, and a whole bunch of broads
Hydro weeeed, smoke, and pistola in my draws
Niggas doooo choke, scared of me, like the laws
Cause that guaaage I tote, blow they back, through the walls
Well they never ever caught me, catch a bar-tee
You could die, rather short-ly, murder par-tee
Drank-in', on a fo'-ty, wanna cross, me
Shot the boy, in his face, now his brother want, me
And my boys took it out of town, oh it's a collision
No-thin' to a gang-sta, that ain't no decision
Seen 'em dippin' wit' them wank-stas, leavin' the club
Guerilla piss, in my sys-tem, a dan-gerous drug
My nigga C, he was driv-in', they pulled on the e-way
Ballin' up behind them, I let, loose the S-K
Through the wind-shield, rip steel, cut they heads off
On expressway, seen a exit then we sped off

[Chorus]
