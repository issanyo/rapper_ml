[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana
Smoke relax and take notes gun smoke gun smoke
I just want the paper I just want the paper
I just want the paper I just want the paper
Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana
Smoke relax and take notes gun smoke gun smoke
I just want the paper I just want the paper
I just want the paper I just want the paper

[Verse: 8Ball]
M.E.M.P.H.I.S
I'm a-rep this here til I walk upon death
My demise ain't here, don't hold your breath
Cook heat over beats so I'm somethin' like a chef
Purple kushes, my bitches wax off they pussy bushes
Eat dick like it's delicious, and grant a pimp wishes
She dig my country talkin', she say I sound funny
Embassy suites sittin' on the bed countin' money
Illegal hustlin', dirty money mostly
Spend it like I never saw a day of pain or sufferin'
Look at my face you can tell I seen both of 'em
I stick 'n' move, do my biz, get the dough and dip
My chronic habit, heavy weed, man, in every city
My money big so my airplane's lil bitty
Major visibility, bad boy lieutenant
Black Phantom with the black guts and I'm in it

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]

[Verse: MJG]
Fuck it! I'm a-blast off, take my mask off
Blow your fuckin' ass off, give me the cash, 'cause
M-J-G not playin' no games
If you not speakin' good, don't be sayin' my name
Nigga, no it ain't OK with you, within a day or two
I'm a-track you down and pull a muthafuckin' rape-aroo
Ain't no way you niggas can hide
I can get you in the house, I can get you outside
I'm a-load the pump up, lay down, jump up
Surprise, everybody finna help me with my come-up
Damn, I done made all of y'all shit yer jeans
This look like it might be a job for Mr. Clean
Ole bootleg nigga, you's a knock-off, an imitation
Local-ass kingpin nigga with a limitation
You don't want no drama with me
â€™Cause I got the ghost of Jeffrey Dahmer with me

[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]

[Verse: Project Pat]
Suckas wanna see me fall, fall like a ton of bricks
It'll never happen, dawg, Project Pat'll play it slick
Flick when I'm in the ride, nine-million homicide
Done when ya come wrong, shoot suckas in the dome
Always about the cheese, didn't wanna go there
He don't wanna pay me, where he stay let's roll there
What's crooked as a crooked letter, humpback, humpback
Soda cook the dope together, jump back, jump back
Meet any weather cock, it pump back, pump back
If ya bust it first, I'm a-dump back, dump back
Down South we gon' hustle to the rooster crow
My nose runnin' still 'cause a nigga used to blow
If pockets low I'll let ya know (don't turn around)
A hair-trigger that'll bust (don't make a sound)
I'm a-tell ya what to do (lay it on the ground)
Don't be hesitatin' fool (before I blow you down)
