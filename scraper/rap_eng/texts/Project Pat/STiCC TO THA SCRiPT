[HOOK: Notty Taylor]
Blunt to my lips
Dime on my hip
Sack in my sock
My uncle need his whip
Pussy on my breath
Curfew or some head?
Sticking to the script
Denzel on Training Day
Blunt to my lips
Dime on my hip
Sack in my sock
My uncle need his whip
Pussy on my breath
Curfew or some head?
Sticking to the script
Still on Plan A

[VERSE 1: Notty Taylor]
Run to the money
Never running from it
Bad bishes on me
I can't tell who legit
Got some new accolades
They just hang off my dick
Trip, tripped going forward
Looking back on that shit
These women over-hyped
That liquor over-priced
This weed don't get me high
East Side, midnight
You could lose ya life
These women over-hyped
That liquor over-priced
This weed don't get me high
No!
Okay, my outbox truth, my inbox lies
Hotbox coupe, 15 tint my rides
Man, no camp fire
Oooh
Shift not allowed
My head in clouds
Can't blend in crowds, I..

[HOOK: Notty Taylor]
Blunt to my lips
Dime on my hip
Sack in my sock

Pussy on my breath

Blunt to my lips

Sack in my sock
My uncle need his whip
Pussy on my breath
Curfew or some head?
Sticking to the script
Still on Plan A

[VERSE 2: JefeHTMG]
They told me cop some gold chains
Cause that make you legit
I feel like if you think like that
Then you really ain't shit
Anytime you see me out
Jef' stay on some shit
9x outta 10 ya bish want me to hit
But I stick to the script
Never switchin' a bit
10 toes, head high
Never flinchin' for shit
I know my music legit
I'm never quittin' for shit
I know some hate me
Cause they music ain't hitting on shit
Notty Taylor, wit me
Oooh you know that it's lit
T.ANT, on the beat
I know y'all niggas is sick
J-E-F-E y'all know the rest
Lil bitch
I been up, fuck sleep
Ain't no rest til we rich
Grinding while you niggas sleepin'
I'm invested in this
Idk why you niggas sleepin'
If ya pockets got lint
We been having this shit
They been thinking we rich
Just by the way the gang move
They know we all the way lit
Yeah, we keep it way cool
Cause we smooth wit it
Never move how they move
Cause we different from them
Ease from the streets
Going all the way legit on 'em
I ain't got beef
If I do, then it was on them
H's UP!
