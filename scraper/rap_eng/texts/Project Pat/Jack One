[Hook]
Jack one, smack one, run off wit ya sack son
Anybody wit the loot, give it up or I'mma shoot

[Verse 1]
.40 in my hand, but nigga I check one slap one
Tote the fucking head to the fat one
Been about that ask me about me
Nigga ain't no fucking joke
Nigga play with me then upper his ass and go
I don't give a fuck about a charge nigga know that
Paranoid street goon nigga and I show that
Chopper bullets raining on your ass ,where your dough at?
Tie that bitch down lay you face ,where the floor at
Cap on dawg I'mma burn me a nigga today
Fool bout my money I don't mind catching a fucking case
Get down like the [mob?]
In my hood they raised me
Niggas start a problem then that nigga gotta pay me

[Hook]


[Verse 2]
Who want war with a nigga like me?
I done time been a beast in these streets
I done crime nigga you can ask the streets
Nigga I ain't lyin I was raised in the streets
I do your ass mad don't be fucking round  me
Call my goons from the Chi watchem fly to Tennesee
And we'll kill every snitch we think will testify
And see how many motherfuckers wanna test me now
Hand on the trigger and nigga I do it
Dawg I don't give a fuck it ain't nothing to it
Robbery my specialty pockets full for a thug
I rob by myself cause I don't trust none

[Hook]
