We's about to whoop some ass nigga we here now
I done cliqued up wit my hood nigga we here now
We gon' fight up in this bitch

(Project Pat)
Swang a fist at ya bitch and I swear I'm crackin jaws
When I'm high and I'm lit aw to hell wit them laws
I ain't givin a got damn you got beef then I'm launchin
In tha streets them bullets in tha club bitch I'm punchin
Muhafuckas lights out cave a suckas skull in
Niggas in here mad but they betta tuck they mugs in
Boys run they mouth and eat up more shit than a goat
Represent tha south and knock ya gold grill down ya throat
Liquor and dat white pump ya up like ya Hercules

Don't you be excused Mr. Bennett I'ma put you in it
You came wit them dudes yall done started but we gonna finish
Fuckin off wit lames in this club fuckin night off

Overheard a nigga sayin that he wanna jack me

(Chorus x2)

(Project Pat)
Who tha buckest up in here Who tha buckest up in here
My nigga my hood so you cowards betta fear
Mane you hoes don't wanna clown if you do we beat ya down
On you let bullets spray parkin lot its going down
Startin shit pullin niggas cards playin goldfish
Bumpin one of us and we gon whoop you like you our bitch
Pay attention muhfucka we clickin like a gun
Mobbin on you punk suckas mane this ain't one on one
Cause its more like ten on two eyes red marijuana
He put up a fight so we gon beat him in a coma
Nigga constantly beckin so he caught some of this drama
Just a few days lata pine box to his mama
A Moet bottle is a nice lil head jamma
Slap you in ya dome bust yo shit like a sledgehammer
Ramma jamma we is doin damage to a busta
Give a damn-a who'll violate you muthafuckas

(Chorus x2)

(Project Pat)
You can step right on up we layin smack down
Now we don't give a fuck cause we gon' crackdown
On you hoes who'll suck and ridin niggas nuts
Playas all in tha club and chargin these sluts
Niggas don't wanna buck that ain't what ya need
Beat his ass to a pulp and took all his weed
Pocketknife you get stuck jailhouse Pop-a-lar
In ya back in ya guts on ya head droppin ya
Swellin eyes bustin lips just like Thunderdome
In da car extra clips you won't make it home
Treatin you like a bitch cause that's what ya is
Cut blood out yo wig playa can you dig
Plastic surgery scalpin like an engine
Don't be testin me mane yo eye get blackened
Neva will miss a week I'ma keep it hood style
If ya down for ya street throw some bows get it wild

(Chorus x2)

I'ma whoop this bitch (why) cause I don't like him  (x8)
Fight (repeated til end)
