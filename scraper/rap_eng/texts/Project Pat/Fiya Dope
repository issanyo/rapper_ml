(INTRO)

Smoke fiya dope
504 to the 901 rolling the dope marijuana burn fiya

(HOOK)

Who got that fiya, who got that fiya, who got that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke, smoke fiya dope


(VERSE 1 - CEO Sekhmet)

Bayou Rum and marijuana blessing my game
Proper provision to get me higher than an aeroplane
I used to fuck with that caine but then a boss slowed down
My patna shipping inventory across town
A soldier from that dirty 3rd come rumble with me
Spitting artillery want join my infantry
Pouring out the liquor roll organic grain
Done been through so much should be clinically insane
I see a lotta thirsty niggas begging for fame
Taking shortcuts to elevate they name
It's all about the music and perfecting your aim
Staying ten toes down inside of passion and pain
Maintaining i was born in that Big Easy
Don't take rocket science to be extraordinary but
I'm always tripping hard and I fuck up things
Its a bitch out here staying in a permanent haze

(HOOK)

Who got that fiya, who got that fiya, who got that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke, smoke fiya dope
Rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke
Smoke a lot of weed rolling up the swisha

(VERSE 2 - Project Pat)

Loud in my blunt so I'm Californina smoking
Dip blunt in the syrup now I'm south floating
In yo gal mouth was wet like a pussy nutting
Left her with a crook in her neck pussy flooded
I'm blowing gas to the head while she blow my dick like she blowing weed
Sucking and she licking on these balls rubbing her weave
OG on that mothafuckin OG green suicide that Juicy J shit
Roll up a m'fuckin blunt light it
Then I inhaled the smoke, I inhaled the smoke
I inhaled the loud (cough, cough, cough)
Niggas know I'm staying on the loud

(HOOK)

Who got that fiya, who got that fiya, who got that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke, smoke fiya dope
Rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke
Smoke a lot of weed rolling up the swisha

(VERSE 3)

(CEO Sekhmet)- Blunt to my lips I'm a soldier ready, I'm a soldier ready, I'm a soldier ready

(Project Pat)- Blowing on this gas nothing but 93, nothing but 93, nothing but 93

(CEO Sekhmet) - Money in the market doing acrobatics, doing acrobatics, doing acrobatics

(Project Pat) - Loud in the trap, flipping flipping, flip it, flipping flipping, flip it, flipping flipping, flip it

(OUTRO - CEO Sekhmet)

On some boss shit thinking bout the profits
On some boss shit thinking bout the profits and operating losses
Who got that fiya dope?
Roll it

(HOOK)

Who got that fiya, who got that fiya, who got that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke, smoke fiya dope
Rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya, rolling that fiya dope
I know how to smoke, I know how to smoke
Smoke a lot of weed rolling up the swisha
