(Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you)

(Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you,)

[Verse 1]
These suckers playing like they killers but they really hoes
Banging nigga like me get choppered up and come to your front door
Mask on my face this ain't no Halloween no Trick or Treat
Shooting bullets longer than your finger, knock you off your feet
Anybody get in my business, gon' end up in smoke (blunts)
You be a body fucker when this move like a ghost
Cuz fuck niggas run they cocksucker till it get real
[?] by the words of your mouth, feel automatic steel
I paid my young niggas a bag to blow up your ass
You is a Django bitch I'm massa', I own your ass
I [?] this shit ain't hard this ain't calculus
Either you gon' have my money or this triggers 'bout to bust

[Chorus]
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses

[Verse 2]
Guns cocked ready to rock and roll
Ready to cock and blow
Arm and Hammer disco, lock the door
Ready to cop some more
Lock and load, ready to transport
Money, that's the goal, keep them throw-a-ways
Just to catch me after I blast a hoe
Pass the dough, then I pass the blow
Keep the cash afloat, the fast life, foot on the accelerator
So I'm machine go, eenie miney moe
Not get any hoes, stripper pole
[?] Like in ATL, I got it

[Chorus]
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses

[Verse 2]
Cheddar cheese, lotta these boys out here playing gamess
Lawyer fees, copin' plea's
But you wanna be the man, just the same game
Still get sold, nigga's fillipin' O's
Niggas watching money [?] the store
Like they pimpin' hoes, rippin' O's
Like a pot roast, I ain't trnya' boast
Burn a nigga like some french toast
Then I'm gettin' ghost, corner store
My command post, Tennessee [?]
Blown purp' out the elbows, [?]

[Chorus]
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of taking losses
Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck you, Pay me, Fuck You, Pay me
I'm sick of all these crosses
