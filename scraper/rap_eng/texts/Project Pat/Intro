Yeah mane you know
Back in my day
Know we should be going on right now but it ain't
Real niggas in the street
Real street niggas didn't fuck with rats
Like snitching ass niggas
Like I'ma keep it one hunna
Like, know how you be seeing the niggas know that they the police
And you know that they know that they police and they still fucking with em
That's all I heard of, my nigga
Like real talk, like
Nigga don't do shit like that
Know what I'm saying
Like that shit is unheard of
That's just like, that's just like god and the devil they cool
Its like god and devil they cool
