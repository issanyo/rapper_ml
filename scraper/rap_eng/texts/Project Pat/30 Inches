[Verse 1, Juicy J]
Comin from the hood, the D-boys
Lot of superstars
Ridin 30 inches on a bucket or a new car
So flingy-flingy, so flingy
So blingy-blingy, so blingy
You see me-see me, you see me
The girls clingy, they clingy
They wanna ride with the Juice Mayn
Mister bang-bang
Ballin down the old common lane, in a Chevy thang
My car is like my wifey so I treat her with the skeeter-skeeter
Rubbers worn out, you can tell by the mileage meter
Betty-Betty McBetty, the name of my new Chevy
She snow-snow whiz-ite, the color of fish scaleys
She gotta-gotta get washed
So clean-clean, no spots
She mine til' she break down, and then I gotta tiz-oss

Ya boy Project Pat, awww

Not a woman out here on the streets can deny you

Jumped into the white leather guts, with the cherry wood
When I flex, like havin sex on a porno flic
Bought some new shoes, all chrome cause I gotta flex

My car is bi-sexual cause she's a ho puller
Bring that gal to daddy, baby we'a gon' do her
You da only woman that a nigga made a murk for
Blow ya like moms, I'll go out like a kick-doe
