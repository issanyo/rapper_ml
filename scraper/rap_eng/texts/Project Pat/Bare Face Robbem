[Intro]
At the end of the day that's all this shit about man
The motherfuckin pesos
That motherfuckin dinero
That cheese nigga

[Hook: x2]
Took a loss in these streets, got a nigga head throbbin
Mind bout to snap if I don't come up on some dollars
Already got them bricks, I'm bout to bare face robbem
Yea I know he's strapped so on top I'm a drop em

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Out here in these streets, took a loss ain't got a grunge
Shot bout to change, I'm bout to take me some money
I ain't thinkin jail, nigga hell on a Sunday
All I think about: I need some paper for Monday
Fuck the consequences cause a nigga need it right now
Catch yo ass loafin I'm a rob yo ass right now
Battin all night and I've been hungry for a mission
Pressin ass niggas, watch yo ass come up missin
I don't give a fuck cause a nigga gotta eat
And if a nigga ain't smoking then I can't think
So nigga when I catch a 40 blast like a rocket
You went blood on the ground, I'm going in yo pockets

[Hook: x2]
Took a loss in these streets, got a nigga head throbbin
Mind bout to snap if I don't come up on some dollars
Already got them bricks, I'm bout to bare face robbem
Yea I know he's strapped so on top I'm a drop em

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
My nigga right now I'm really going through a struggle
Tryna feed myself, my son, baby momma
Man I'm dead serious, you can hear the hunger
When it rains and pours you gon feel the thunder
You niggas pull that move, got me ridin with a choppa
I'm headed right now to go burn yo niggas' block up
Hear you niggas stress but I'm bout to cut the top out
Off these niggas heads mane, make em straight cop out
And tell me where the stash at, or you gon get blasted
Bust you in yo back, hole bigger than yo ass crack
Been in these streets ever since I was a young nigga
Penitentiary taught me I'm not a dumb nigga

[Hook: x2]
Took a loss in these streets, got a nigga head throbbin
Man I'm bout to snap if I don't come up on some dollars
Already got them bricks, I'm bout to bare face robbem
Yea I know his straps so off top I'm a drop em
