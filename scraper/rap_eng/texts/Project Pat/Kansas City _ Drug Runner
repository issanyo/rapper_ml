[Hook: Berner]
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city (KCMO)
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city (KCMO)
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me

[Verse 1: Berner]
When you get big bread and once you
All I ever wanted was a chain and a Benz
All I ever wanted was and my girl her friends
A nice head stash and a big bag to spend
Young Bern this the city boy
I used to move weed just like Tity Boi
I love to smoke the Lemon but it get me Noid
You see that pretty bitch she a new employee
Got her in the strip club counting big bucks
On my tour bus I’m bout to get my dick sucked
Yeah I still ship mud, yeah I still flip bud, I still sell blow
(Dope Boy) Why they talking’ crazy on my cellphone

[Hook: Berner]
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Gelato in the air, money in the attic
Send em bout a thirty, triple wrap em in plastic
Roll your own blunt cause once I light it I don’t pass it
And you know I hate fuck niggas with a passion
Went and got a plug and I been on ever since (forreal)
And if it don’t make money then it don’t make sense
I sent the pack to her crib but nah she ain’t my bitch
I caught a flat tire got mad and bought another whip
Kiss grandma goodbye its time to take another trip
Pop the seal on the pint and drink it like a fifth
Trunk full of Al Green smoking like Uncle Snoop
Trap nigga but I got hoes like Uncle Luke
Its Dolph

[Hook: Berner]
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I got rich out in Kansas City (KCK)
Money in the air this ain’t magic city
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me
Yeah I’m riding dirty and the pack is with me

[Verse 1: Berner]
My phone ringing I’m a plug some
And when that pack coming I’mma plug some
Feds on my line tryna bug some
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’mma drug runner
Flat rate boxes wave the autograph
I'd rather wrap a kilo, I 'on’t wanna rap
I’m shady baby I'mma need all of that
He threw me 50 Ps I moved all of that
My phone keep ringing I’mma plug some
A hundred fifty cash I’mma drug runner
Pretty ass bitches I’mma fuck some
I’m fresh back in town I’m tryna plug some
Nothin like the way I move I set up shop
White blocks out, instead I’m tryna play it cool
You know me I’m tryna make a move
Crazy jewels on my neck and the way I lose (never)(Bern)

[Second Hook: Berner]
My phone ringing I’m a plug some
And when that pack coming I’mma plug some
Feds on my line tryna bug some
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’mma drug runner
Drug runner, and when that pack coming I’mma plug some
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’m a drug runner
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’m a drug runner

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Fuck that slow cheese I’mma take the fast route
You niggas talk to much thats why the barrel's in your mouth
Leave em the package, I got sick of weighing ’em
And fuck that middle dude, I got sick of paying ’em
Plug came from Warrens met me in El Paso
Right across the border wanted 10 gave me 20 more
I want money searching for it like a hound dog
Either get these pounds off or let these rounds off
Ain’t talking bout money, put him on mute, cut the sound off
These niggas ain’t got no paper thats why I stay from round y’all
I’mma get my ass in if I’m asked out
If ain’t got no bribe money I’m pulling that mask out

[Outro: Berner]
My phone ringing I’m a plug some
And when that pack coming I’mma plug some
Feds on my line tryna bug some
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’mma drug runner
Drug runner, and when that pack coming I’mma plug some
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’m a drug runner
But I don’t give a fuck cause I’m a drug runner
