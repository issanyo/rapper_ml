[Hook]
Put two dollars in the air, for these two dollar niggas
Put two dollars in the air, for these two dollar niggas
Put two dollars in the air, for these two dollar niggas
Put two dollars in the air, for these two dollar niggas
They get mad and they fuss, they don't shine like us
They get mad and they fuss, they don't shine like us
They get mad and they fuss, they don't shine like us
They get mad and they fuss, they don't shine like us

[Verse 1]
Project Pat, from the street nigga, I'm bringing this heat nigga
Never do I back down, don't accept defeat nigga
Calicos, bullet holes, gun shells left on site
Niggas killed over hoes or, over left and right
Hats cocked, guns pop, quick to have a trigger fit
On a punk trick, knowing good and well he counterfeit
All you do is talk, out'cha mouth, you don't never do
Nothing' that you say, out'cha cap, it ain't never true
Bury you, quicker than a nigga that done told something
Seen you in the club beat you down like you owe something
Know, something wrong pistol player, call you gun show
Real niggas mayne, never speak what we don't know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(Mayne I got that kush kush) You ain't got nothin'
(Mercedes Benz I push push) Mayne quit'cha frontin'
(Made a fifty thousand dollar stang) Nigga you's a liar
(Fool I'm out here selling keys) You needs to retire
You's a babbage weed seller and a watered down Henn' drinker
I heard you snitched out ya crew, you's a ship sinker
Them hollow points in the gun gonna deal wit'cha
I'll wipe the smile off ya face when the steel hit'cha
2 dollar niggas claim they chargin' and playin' whores
But they is out here flaugin' and payin' whores
Nigga you trippin'. Datin', and meetin' whores?
Claimin' you pimpin', savin' and eatin' whores?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One day you wearin' red, and then it's blue the next
2 dollar niggas be the main ones flipping sets
You say you gripping techs, regulating wit' the torch
Was 25 and you decided to jump off the porch??
If he get caught, mouth run hot, like broke radiator
Tell about the spots, and the plots, and the perpetrators
You treat the cops, like ya pops, cause ya runnin' to 'em
I'm non-stop, wit' that Glock, put that gun into him
These older niggas put these youngsters on a bloody stage
That's why these young niggas get killed, at an early age
Sent on a dummy mission from a dummy in a cage
2 dollar leadership'll put you in a early grave

[Hook]
