[Verse: 1]
Army gun, M16, have you carried out by 6
Fifty clip, AR5th, one shot have you doing flips
Banana clips, in the chopper for you monkey ass niggas
Bullets keep a appetite
Eat you up for Sunday dinner
AK slugs, twists and turns
Straight in you like a blender
Bullet and rifle crash you in the face
Like a window
I’m a animal, in the jungle, on some survival shit
Sneak detectives, masked up
That Al Qaeda shit
A brick boy get a Nigga ass seen, get one
Nigga didn’t want to give his plug
So I plugged him one
In the leg, next shot in the head
I’m tryna to  get ahead
Nigga gon shoot that lead
When it’s all about that bread

Middle finger to my enemy (fuck yaw)
Guess I’m never sleeping in these streets (fuck naw)
Guess I’m never scared to buss my heat (fuck naw)
Put a bitch over my money (fuck naw)
Middle finger to my enemy (fuck yaw)

[Verse 2]
We move strategically
Shoot back immediately
I didn't receive the drugs, then the murder was a grievance
Got your bitch on a bended knees
Whilst she sucking me
I just bought her a lunch my nigga
You know shit ain't for free
To be ‘round me goin’ cause a fee
And that’s an apostrophe
We called the street life the gang
But it ain't monopoly
Forgiato on the ride, kill them homicide
Rock just  like me go about my money, everybody die
If you owe me, then you owe my plug, I could die
Like potatoe wedges, in that grease, you gon fry
From them AK slugs, when they hit that ass up
Choppa bullets to his torso, split that ass up

Guess I’m never sleeping in these streets (fuck naw)
Guess I’m never scared to buss my heat (fuck naw)
Put a bitch over my money (fuck naw)
