(Intro, Crank Lucas & Project Pat)
This shit man Crank Lucas
And I got the OG Project Pat with me
(oooh)
You a rapper, a actor, you sell clothes, drug dealer
You pimpin, you sell cars whatever it is you do cool
You do that shit to the fullest
Cause the only way you gon' be able to be saucin and bossin
Is if you runnin your own business
(Crank Lucas)

(Hook, Crank Lucas)
Go and get a pack that dope won't sell itself
Go and get a trap that coat won't sell itself
Go and get a lot those cars don't sell themself
Go and get a shot those clothes don't sell emself
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin

(Verse 1, Crank Lucas)
Now after you get that back sell
That crack sell
That weed sell
That tree, whatever you do
Buy you two, buy you three
Then apply for EIM
Aka, tax ID
Take a couple hundred dollars and go get your LLC
Make a new line of credit with that same tax ID
From that one you used that is your social security
Buy some shit then pay it off, make them payments don't be late
In 6 months, you'll be runnin up the score like Golden State
Now you take that to the bank
And you go get you a loan
And where most people fuck it up you gotta leave it long
A couple months you repay em and you get a bigger loan
After five times you can get a million dollar home
But the smartest thing to do
Is your homies do it too
Follow suit
Take your loans
Buy a complex as a crew
Put your money into cars
Or y'all go in on some land
Get the dollar circulatin in your hood yea that's a plan
(what you sayin mo'?)

I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
I'm saucin, I'm bossin, I'm flexin, I'm flossin
