Hook:
Girl I been tryna save you/
But you ain't been tryna save me back/
And I can’t really blame you/ cause on the real I already know better/ mama said Don't save her/ she don't want to be saved Don’t save her/ she don't want to be saved
Don't save her/ she don't want to be saved
Don't save her/
(Save her, Save her, Save her)

Verse 1:
It's so hard not to love her/
When I know what she feels undercover/
But I got to let it burn like usher/ Yeah These are my confessions/
Shawty know she bad
Shawty know I'm wit it/
Shawty know if she want it all she got to do is come get it/ one thing that's wrong though my lifestyle don’t match hers/ we the same whip in the same lane doing the same speed but we two curves/ she bend left I bend right/ me I’m the day time/ she like night/ I'm in the church house on sunday/ she in the night club on sunday/
Can’t save her she don't want to be (no)

Verse 2:
Don't save her/ Don't pay her/
No attention/ No favors/
Like hard things in her mouth like now & laters/ love red bottoms like some pumps to some gators/ that thing clappn for the dollar/ buy some drinks take her home she'll swallow/ buy a cap and a gown now she's a scholar/ sexy but she messy gossip beauty parlor/ tried to take her on a trip/ but didn't watch her lips/ talking crazy to a pimp so I had to cancel it/
Flippn money stacking grit/ keep they drayko extra clip/ the snakes will peep your bread set you up I never slip/
