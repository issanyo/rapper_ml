[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
I drop hits after hits after motherfuckin' hits

Fuckin' bitch after bitch after motherfuckin' bitch

[Verse 1: Duke Deuce]
I got hits on hits, 'bout my dough, that's it
Bitch get off my dick, I gots to get rich
Memphis on enrage, we got straps for days
Infested with gangs, gon' respect my name
Bitch I'm on as fuck, I got hoes to fuck
Slap her on the butt, 'til I bust a nut
If you ain't from my hood you can get from 'round here
I'm a Black Haven gangster and I'm stepped around here
We don't give a fuck, bitch we lit, get fucked up
Doughnuts in a truck, fuck a light, we too buck
Bitch on bitch on bitch, and one me, and that's it
Took off on they ass, now them M's comin' in, uh
Fuck the other side, all these guys gon' ride
Bitches they gon' ride, set you up and slide
Gangster in my eyes, I won't tell you lies
Keep some on my side, in case you bitches try

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
I drop hits after hits after motherfuckin' hits

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I had the G-A-N-G-S-T-Aer
I got cake bitch, I got layers
Foot on a bitch, head like some slayers
Draco with the drum, came with two pairs
A hood necessity, I got the recipe
Can't let no bitch or no nigga be stressin' me
Got hitters who will kill, don't you be testin' me
You be around the way, better be blessin' me
Ain't no arguin', my niggas robbin'
Your bitch double back, came through bobbin'
Swallowin', gobblin', man she a goblin
Ate up a nigga's dick like it was cobbler
Open her legs, we all had to sock her
Nut in her mouth, kick her out like soccer
Back to the bread, back to the blocka
My niggas got dreads, wild like Waka
North Memphis, we'll shoot at a copper
Beat a bitch homie if he is not proper
Strapped with a chopper, or with a glocker
We gonna shoot first, that's off the topper
Crop of Cali, that's what we need
These hoes in heat, they need breedin'
Goons are hungry, they need feedin'
Gun to your head, ain't no pleadin'
Squeeze the trigger, you gon' be bleedin'
We gon' leave you, I'ma be seedin'
Breathin', flippin', juggin', and hustlin'
If it make money, we gon' be musclin'
Ain't no tusslin', we gon' be bustin'
You owe me, ain't no discussion
Bullets at head, murder concussion
My nigga, end of discussion

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
I drop hits after hits after motherfuckin' hits
I got sticks after sticks after motherfuckin' sticks
Fuckin' bitch after bitch after motherfuckin' bitch
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, pussy nigga I'm the shit, ayy
Duke got hits after hits, uh
Duke got stick after sticks, uh
Duke gon' bitch after bitch, uh
Bitch I'm Duke Deuce, I'm the shit, uh
Duke got hits after hits, uh
Duke got stick after sticks, uh
Duke gon' bitch after bitch, uh
Bitch I'm Duke Deuce, I'm the shit, ayy

[Verse 3: Duke Deuce]
Cock back quick, then I shoot a bitch
Think shit sweet, you a stupid bitch
Duke keep some shooters like the president
They won't hesitate to hit your residence
Boy these niggas lame as fuck and they can't keep up
And we know you're broke as fuck, and you're out of luck
I ain't got time play no games, this ain't Jeopardy man
Shoot them choppers with no aim, left right, left right, bang
Gangster in me, not just on me, nigga you's a damn jabronie
I got green stuffed in pockets, bless me if I walk up on it
You a bum so if she let you hit, my nigga I don't want her
If some niggas call for me right now then I'ma go like Tony
Treat my pistol like I treat my dick 'cause I'ma keep it on me
Nah I ain't a crip, but you niggas gotta see me on me
Miss me with that fuck shit, talkin' down, get bucked quick
Talkin' like a groupie bitch, miss me with that sucker shit

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
I drop hits after hits after motherfuckin' hits
I got sticks after sticks after motherfuckin' sticks
Fuckin' bitch after bitch after motherfuckin' bitch
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, pussy nigga I'm the shit, ayy
Duke got hits after hits, uh
Duke got stick after sticks, uh
Duke gon' bitch after bitch, uh
Bitch I'm Duke Deuce, I'm the shit, uh
Duke got hits after hits, uh
Duke got stick after sticks, uh
Duke gon' bitch after bitch, uh
Bitch I'm Duke Deuce, I'm the shit, ayy
