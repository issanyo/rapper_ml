[Hook]
If a nigga owe me money, he gon' pay me
I been waiting for too long, I'm outta patience
Ain't no perm, but I bet I'll get some straightening
If they ain't got it, I'ma mask up and take it
Mask up and take it
Mask up and take it
Mask up and take it
Mask up and take it
Cause if a nigga owe me money, he gon' pay me
I been waitin for too long, I'm outta patience
Mask up and take it

[Verse 1]

If a nigga owe me money, he gon' pay me
I been waitin for too long, I'm outta patience
Heard he been ballin' so hard, and caught him flakin'
Hit his ass wit that pistol, turn that boy into a patient
Totin' pistols daily, if they ain't got it; I'ma mask up
Jump out on your block in that motherfuckin' Ram truck
Ask him where tha's at, his reply was no answer
Ask his ass again, his reply; Still no answer
Shoot him in his leg, then I told his ass to stand up
Brought me to the stash, bruh I heard you runnin' bands up
And you got that gas too, let me get them grammed up
You don't get no damn love
You ain't from my damn hood

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I get some straightening bout my motherfuckin' money
Styrofoam full of surp, my shit runny
If you got it; I ain't got it, then I want it
Run up on your ass with that thang, come up off it
Take a nigga jewelry, then I beat it like an auction
Shoot his ass down with that forty, so keep talking
Niggas be flexed up in my city, like they the only niggas strapped up with a weapon in my city
Not to mention niggas get set up from these fuckin' bitches, you know these niggas snitches (Rats)
But you still gon fuck wit it?
That's like the blind lead the blind (For real)
You need to give me what you owe me though, before I'm kickin' in yo door

[Hook]
