[Hook]
Smoking weed by the bong
And the lean got me sprung
Molly got my heart beating beating beating like a drum
Smoking weed by the bone
And the lean got me sprung
Molly got my heart beating beating beating like a drum
I'm high I'm high but I'm trying to get higher
I'm high I'm high but I'm trying to get higher
I'm high I'm high but I'm trying to get higher
I'm high I'm high but I'm trying to get higher

[Verse 1]
Rolling up, just a roll again
Couple inside a cup, either purple or drank
Yea a nigga fucked up
Hunnid band party, told her bring all of her friends
You can see how high I am
[?]
I'm trying to get higher G, 5 with a G pin
Yous a enterprise, I get high like the Weeknd
420 365 divide it multiply
Add and subtract that, and you see just how high
I'ma get all day long
Project Pat sing that song
Fly on them paper planes
High on that Mary Jane
My mayne day
Half a ounce just to stay the same
Kush is appearing like David Blaine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I just woke up, whole ounce
Rolled up pre melamine cups
Get the blunt, then light it up
I'm trying to get higher, but it seems I have no luck
This is what happens when you got the best drums
Benzyl weed, cherry pie, [?}, blue cheese, cotton candy kush with some pink lean
And I ate the weed, can't do shit for me
Straight fire, my home I drink this Promethean
Niggas talking bout stash, they probably name 3
After me I'm a pro, mister shroom tea
With the yellow lean, now I'm bout the lean
Half of me wanna sleep, the other wanna talk with trees
