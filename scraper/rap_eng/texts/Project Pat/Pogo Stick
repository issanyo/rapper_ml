[Hook - Project Pat]
Aww yeah, there she goes
Skinny jeans and stilettos
Every time she walk her booty wobble like some Jell-O
Aww yeah, there she goes
Nails done got her hair fixed
Lip gloss, and she knows how to ride that pogo stick
Ride that pogo stick, ride that ride that pogo stick (4x)

[Verse 1 - Project Pat]
It's your boy P-A-T-za
I ain't gonna tease ya
I mangle that coochie hole
I know how to please ya
Some hard little titty nipples
Go on make that booty jiggle
Polish sausage in your face
Might as well take a nibble
Have you walking like a cripple
When a nigga get ya
I needs me a victim
Bend on over let me stick ya
Swallowed you a pill
Now yo' clit start tinglin'
Gotta give her that long hard black ding-a-ling
Something like jangalang
Cuz I'm on these hoes dawg
Bigger than a corn dog
Girls call me horn dog
Up and down up and down
Ridin' like a boss
Imma' put you in the bucket
And nail you to the cross

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Project Pat]
Toot that booty in the air
Just shake just shake
She gettin' action over there
Don't hate don't hate
We get it crackin' up in here
Bottles poppin' up in here
Purple smokin', VIP
Liquor swallowed up in here
Got these juicy booty hoes with the g-strings on
When they play that Project Pat, that beat, that's my song
Memphis Tenn, my home, North Memphis my throne
Back out, showin' tatts with them Apple Bottoms on
Yeah we love havin' sex
But we'd rather get some cap
Get to grindin' on this thing
While you sittin' on my lap
Ooh I think I see a gap
Right between them bow legs
I wanna hit you from the back with your legs to your head

[Hook]
