[Intro]
Bounce, bounce (Yeah)
Bounce, bounce (Yeah)
Bounce, bounce (Yeah)
Bounce, bounce

[Chorus: French Montana & (Wiz Khalifa)]
Choppa choppa down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down (Smoking while I'm rapping)
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down (Yeah)
I lay a nigga down, down, down (Means I'm higher than you, uh)
I lay a nigga down

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Rep this gang, bitch, I'ma roll this plane, bitch
You talkin' English but money, that’s my language
New car, new home, even got a new main bitch
Can’t call, new phone, but I’m still on that same shit
Bossin' 'cause I came into this game without a boss
Um, and I’m eatin' good so I just gotta floss
And, and, and I spent your advance just on my Audemars
I’m here today, then I’m gone tomorrow
Can’t find a pound 'cause I buy 'em and break 'em

[Chorus: French Montana & (Gucci Mane)]
Choppa choppa down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down (It's Gucci)
I lay a nigga down, down, down

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Worldstar alert, in the hood Gucci Mane is icy
In the hood so fuckin' fresh that the bitches wanna bite me
Got a black choppa and a black tee, Bun B, honor, Pimp C
Free Boosie, free my nigga, burr, free Willy, ya feel me?
I ain't with all that rap beef 'cause this world's a rat race
And I'm out here tryna stack cheese, right here in these haters' face
They all tried to murder me but that's how the world be
Please Lord, forgive me, my instincts are so street
Snapback hat and a throwback, ask Greg Street, he know that
And you not out here ridin' around solo, since '93, can you hold that?
I signed myself, you can find me with that muscle behind me
I'm grindin', my AR-15 same color as my timepiece

[Chorus: French Montana]
Choppa choppa down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shots be flyin', niggas die, don’t make a sound
Chrome .44, in slow mo’ when your body hit the ground
Ground, ground, ground, nigga, look around
Got shooters, got guns, got bitches, got white, motherfucker, we run the town
When them shots be flyin', niggas divin', dyin', runnin' tryna hit the ground
Security, need security when them shots be flyin' around
Cocaine music, not stoppin' that, with Juicy J, I'm Project Pat
I got the streets, nigga, fine with that, chasin' that money, never stoppin' that
With a big ass choppa, cocaine Mafia
Lay a nigga down if a nigga try to stop us
Choppa, break it down and I fix a nigga problem
Low to the ground in a roof no top
Heatin' up the streets, I ain’t never gon' stop
Niggas ask around, "When the shit gonna drop?"
Nigga so hot, jewels so cold
Still let a choppa choppa down

[Chorus: French Montana]
Choppa choppa down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa down, down, down
I lay a nigga down, down, down
Choppa choppa break it down, down, down
I lay a nigga
