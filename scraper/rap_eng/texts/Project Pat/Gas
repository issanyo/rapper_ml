I got the gas, off in the hood
Turnt to the max, smoke that green
Come shop with me
I got that sack, got what you need
That neon green, I keep the pack
I'm on fire, I'm burning up
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I'm on fire, I'm burning up
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas

[verse:1 project pat]
I got the gas, off in the hood
Turnt to the max, better chill
I pop the pill, know how to act
Put that molly off in my water, don't do no tab
Drankin liquor, spit up the swisher
Fill it up with grass, smoking kesha
Don't do no reggie, my name ain't kim
Roll the gas, what the fuck you rollin
Them seats are still, chasin hims, may give me in
Stacking here for ends, couple of pounds of this stack of shit
To cope me a benz, way back then
You smoke the mid 2006, check me 9, blown off the shit
Now that I land, here I am, them take them bails
Prolly in my van, yes I am
Man fuck them pigs, I'm going ham

I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I'm on fire, I'm burning up
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas

[verse:2 project pat]
I wake up in the early morn, looking to the dawn
Talking loud, bitch I'm blowing strong, og my cologne
Bitch I'm gone, what the fuck you mean
I do what I want
Grab my tong, then I grab my step
In way up a zone
Bitch I'm on, when I gets it in, best believe it's gone
Ship it out, girl you moving fast, I be like what's wrong
Fuck you mean, you ain't got my cheese, I'm like nigga please
Ain't no taking ease, damn expensive cheese
Bout to put your mind at ease
Help him please find the life line
Cause he can keep it g
Blowing purp, a vanilla swish, I don't give a fuck
Just 35 I'm a grind it up, filling it a blunt
Take your bitch, hit her from the back, I know she gonn front
Bitch don't act, that is in my cup, 4 o's in my [?]
With these zans, I think I'm the man
Don't know who I am, once again, I stay blowing gas
Like the ceiling fan

I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
I'm on fire, I'm burning up
I got the gas, I got the gas, I got the gas
