[Hook: Project Pat]
I drop 3 zips and got 50 extra
Fish scale yola, got a different texture
Stupid in the kitchen, say I'm doing extra
Plug think I'm cool, fool do me extra
40 pounds ain't enough, I'm a need some extra
So a nigga flexin, she say I'm mackin extra
But one bitch ain't enough, I'm a get some extra
One strap ain't the bizness, I'm a need some extra

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
They say a nigga greedy cause I feel I need extra
Take it to the kitchen, whippin chickens make em extra
Watch out I finess it, put the remix on that flex shit
Got a couple extra bills, I'm a need some extra
Gams, grams, trap, jumpin out the gym, boing
Dope on the table, see them fishscale fiends
Cellphone blowin up, fiends screamin winnin
Last night was booming, reel up and did it again
These hoes say I'm flexin talkin bout I'm mackin extra
These bitches, they are short and they tight, give you some extra
Call up my shooter, knock em off, I'll pay you extra
Run up on that pussy, give em a red light special

[Verse 2: Chriz Millz]
I'm baking out the ash, baking soda mixture
Straight drop, 1, flip, 2 and got them extra
A girlfriend like to get geek I brought some extra
Running through that pack I told the plug I need some extra
Lookin real slick with the check from the extra
Love them 50 slices in the bed she do some extra
Head game ridiculous I gave her something extra
Shoppin sprees on Tuesdays, true religion at the extra
My sack was getting low, that liquor sweet, I had to flex it
I'm never sattisfied, I go so hard to get that extra
You sittin on your ass, expect to come up on some extra
Pussy ass niggas make you go and buy some extra
Clips automatic, choppers spray I give em extra
You can thank me later, extra hard on these haters
All these niggas snitchin, talking extra on them papers
Fuckin all they slices, let these suckers with the vapors
