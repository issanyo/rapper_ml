[Intro: TheRealPIT]
Karltin
Ooh, yeah, ayy
Uh, oh, I like this, Karltin

[Chorus: TheRealPIT]
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go
I've been hustlin', gettin' it in on the low
Keep these niggas out your business and never tell a soul
Foul me, I'ma shoot these free throws
My team winnin', boy, you'd better check the score
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go

[Verse 1: TheRealPIT]
Yeah, ayy, check my footwork, nigga, check my feet, uh
This shit knockin', I got Karltin on the beat (He on the beat)
Yeah, that's your girl, but I heard that she a freak
Got it out the mud, boy, I'm still in these streets, uh
I gotta eat, I do it for my peeps
Do it for these kids, 'cause now I got three
You see the swag, it drip when I pass
Have you ever pulled money out a brown paper sack?
Ayy, have you ever road ran just to go and get some packs?
Have you ever seen a ho say no to a stack?
Dopeboy shit, we get it in just like that
Dope, dopeboy shit, we get it in just like that

[Chorus: TheRealPIT]
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go
I've been hustlin', gettin' it in on the low
Keep these niggas out your business and never tell a soul
Foul me, I'ma shoot these free throws
My team winnin', boy, you'd better check the score
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
She so freaky with it, but she on her hustle
You ain't tippin', shawty dippin', pimpin' off the muscle
Baby on her hustle, she been through the struggle
It don't hurt to flirt but you gon' have to pay to cuddle
She say fuck a dick, she be on some wealthy shit
The bitch wanna have somethin', she gettin' to the grip
But when that pussy drip, them legs open up
She on that liquor and them Xans, she gon' have to fuck
Lips soft but she love a hard dick on 'em
When I pull that boy out, she wanna lick on him
Didn't have rubber on, and she tried to sit on him
Didn't have the rubber on, bitch tried to sit on him?

[Chorus: TheRealPIT]
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go
I've been hustlin', gettin' it in on the low
Keep these niggas out your business and never tell a soul
Foul me, I'ma shoot these free throws
My team winnin', boy, you'd better check the score
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go

[Verse 3: TheRealPIT]
Ayy, ayy, what the business? Give 'em the business
Shout out to my young niggas, got me sippin' and I'm tippin'
Don't need no chickenheads, only bad bitches
Don't need no bad vibes while I'm chasin' riches, uh
I got the shot and I shoot it just like Curry
It go down in my DM, boy, I swear these bitches thirsty
Never tell my left hand what my right hand doin'
Turnin' up that young baller, drinkin' on young baller fluids
Never let the ball drop (Never let the ball drop)
Lay low from the cops (Lay low from the cops)
These niggas act like cops (These niggas act like cops)
Without that water, fish flop (Without that water, fish flop), ayy

[Chorus: TheRealPIT]
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go
I've been hustlin', gettin' it in on the low
Keep these niggas out your business and never tell a soul
Foul me, I'ma shoot these free throws
My team winnin', boy, you'd better check the score
Two things I ain't never seen before
Is a UFO and a ho that won't go
