My gal liked that brown
My cousin liked that white
I like to smokeaaa (x2)
My partners sipping lean and do them pills all night
I like to smokeaaa (x2)
[?] and they love the rocks
I love to smokeaaa (x2)
My uncle loved them young strippers on them molly wops
I like to smokeaaa (x2)

[Verse 1]
Lemon D, OG mash
Project Purp put ya on yo ass
You can get a lot of people high and get a lot of cash
It's a paper spend up bone
California in my lungs
Loud smoke like religion
Have you speaking in tongues
Higher than a astronaut
Ready mane to smash a thot
Skeet some nut on her back
Then I'm skeeting off the lot
A mouse on my cheddar cheesey
But I'm staying high like Weezy
Owing money mane to Project Peezy
Put you in a squeezy
Riding round blowing gas
Stronger than a junky's fart
[?]
Round my neck diamond Rolex watch
Granddaddy slow a nigga down like grand pappy
In the back of the Maybach I done took a nappy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hit the weed pass the dope
Blunt the lips inhale the smoke
Do this shit bout 4 more times and then yo mind gon' start to blow
Start to blink, start to faint
Like a smoker start tweaking
Bout a couple of hours you gon' want some chips or something sweet
Munchies munchies I'm so hungry
Icy white honey bunnys
Or maybe some Papa John's with some extra pepperoni
Baloney that babbage weed, that's not what we need
You need to be planting that shit it's nothing but seeds
Sometimes I get so high I might forget my name
I'm supposed to catch a train
I got on a plane
Drugs on the plane mane that's federal pen
But I'm still getting it N-G-O-P
