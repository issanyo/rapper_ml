[Intro]
Squad! Uhhhh
(DAYUM SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?)
Three 6 Mafia

[Hook: Frenchie]
My bitches bring me your whole stero-status
I run this trick from Juicy J to Project Pat, uhhh
Gold teeth, playing music, bussin' slabs
Sippin' that drank, that put me on my back
Yeee, I'm a hunnit thousand, my swagga hunnit thousand
I made a hunnit thousand, off that public housin'
A hunnit thousand, I'm so one hunnit mane
Brick squad, thats what I'm yellin' mane

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
Bandz A Make Her Dance, Juicy J's her dad
I'm in the hood, like Project Pat
I'm sipping dat drank, that drank leave a nigga so low, low
I'm taking your bitch, like limbo I make her go low, low
Bricksquad losing, that ain't common sense
Ever since shirt off, I've been seeing common sense
Sippin' on some sizzurp, I want her I'm gon' get her
Your man just checked your phone, and he just saw my picture

[Hook: Frenchie]
My bitches bring me your whole stero-status
I run this trick from Juicy J to Project Pat, uhhh
Gold teeth, playing music, bussin' slabs
Sippin' that drank, that put me on my back
Yeee, I'm a hunnit thousand, my swagga hunnit thousand
I made a hunnit thousand, off that public housin'
A hunnit thousand, I'm so one hunnit mane
Brick squad, thats what I'm yellin' mane

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Niggas say they keep it real, yeah real police
When these mothafucking foney shit ever sees [?]
Look you suckas in yo eyes while the burners raise
While you pleading for your life, shoot you in yo face
[?], or to the opposition
A nigga run up with yo pack, or they own yo snitch on
Out the kitchon, a hundred thousand money flip on
All this rattin' out here mane, gon' make me start pip on

[Hook: Frenchie]
My bitches bring me your whole stero-status
I run this trick from Juicy J to Project Pat, uhhh
Gold teeth, playing music, bussin' slabs
Sippin' that drank, that put me on my back
Yeee, I'm a hunnit thousand, my swagga hunnit thousand
I made a hunnit thousand, off that public housin'
A hunnit thousand, I'm so one hunnit mane
Brick squad, thats what I'm yellin' mane
