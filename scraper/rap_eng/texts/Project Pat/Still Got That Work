[Intro: Project Pat]
Shouts out to the whole Taylor Gang
Salute to the big homey Juicy J
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Salute to the homey Wiz Khalifa
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Project Pat]
All this money a nigga made ain't change me
No I'm always gon' be the same, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)
Smokin' on that Cali strong every time I roll up
Reppin' it everywhere I go, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All this money a nigga made niggas can't take it
All this money a nigga made and I'm still makin' it
Lot of new niggas comin out and I don't feel none
Lot of you got fake diamonds on, I'm rockin real ones
Now they get excited when I pull up in that old school blowin that shit up out it
Ya'll talkin', I've been about it
Now haters forget about it
From serving weed in a alley to smoking weed out in Cali
I swerve and weave in my chally, what's on my feet cost a thouwy
My other car handmade, the manual come in Italian
My nigga, I've been gettin' them benjamins
Shippin' my friends in 'em
We servin' like Wimbledon
You talkin' I'm living it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Project Pat]
All this money a nigga made ain't change me
No I'm always gon' be the same, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)
Smokin' on that Cali strong every time I roll up
Reppin' it everywhere I go, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Project Pata', hustle for the cheddar
And betta, keep it straight hood to the letter
North Memphis Tennessee, that's what I rep (ah)
Where they blow your brains broad day for the cheddah
Pressure, make a broke man get that burna
Slap you in the mouth like Ike did Tina Turner
And take all your bread, middle fingers to the feds
My nigga against the fence and he gon' hustle 'till he dead
Same spot, same mix, same pot, same bricks
In my hood them same junkies looking for they same fix
Tornado swag, blue the coupe, off the roof
Blowing Cali strong, mind blown off the loot

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa & Project Pat]
All this money a nigga made ain't change me
No I'm always gon' be the same, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)
Smokin' on that Cali strong every time I roll up
Reppin' it everywhere I go, some of my niggas
(Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it
Still got that work, Still got that work, Still got it)
