[Verse 1]
I was just getting started in the rap game
Still had one foot remain in the drug game
I’m my own boss
Could a left this bitch like I came
Pump it like the pussy
To walk away with being sane
Lord bless me main
I need to switch my life up
Put the weed and liquor down
Try to get wifed up
Austin Powers with these whores
My son’s now Minime
Picked the wrong baby mama
Sleeping with the enemy
Real niggas [?] fuck the bitch and mean that shit
Go to jail, get money
Nigga leave that bitch
You suppose to be one
Like the coke and the coke pan
Lady heroine can turn a boss into a broke man
Got to take control of these bitches like a bad habit
Dress her like a queen and she’ll still be a maggot
All these steady[?] and the drummer you can miss me
You can miss me, kiss me
Naw, ain't no telling where your lips be
Or been, on been, that real could have been
Buy you a new purse
Bitch I ain't none a dem
(Naw I ain't none a dem
You heard)
Bitch I ain't none a dem

[Hook] 2x
Should’ve paid your light bill
You bought a outfit
Need to get your mind right
Get off that dumb shit
Handle your priorities
Your priorities
Handle your priorities
Your priorities

[Verse 2]
Let me explain the deal
I can’t miss a meal
I know your pussy wet
And you stay on pills
And you stay on liquor
And you stay on green
I ain't sleepin’ around snakes
I don’t stay on lean
How’d you focus bitch
Know when you suck my dick
Bands keep my dick on [?]
Motherfucker bitch
And you niggas catchin’ murder charges over hoes?
You are some stupid motherfuckers
Case closed
Call me Hector
I’m about my pesos
Money first , bitch last
You can replace hoes
If the cheddar cheese like some Queso
Youy rather [?] goes a bummer and chase hoes

[Hook]
Should’ve paid your light bill
You bought an outfit
You need to get your mind right
Get off that dumb shit
Handle your priorities
Your priorities
Handle your priorities
Your priorities

[Verse 3]
When is income tax time
You bitches bawling down
Forty five days later
You’d be calling down
To the man upstairs
Looking for a bliss
By unnecessary shit
Get a Smith & Wesson
And blow your brains out
Bitches get out the way
Real niggas save their money for a rain each day
And make a plate every chance that a nigga get
Fuck boss every chance nigga shit
That bitch open ‘em legs every chance a nigga hittin
Once  blow a button, blow a nut a nigga splittin
Light bills still due
Kids gotta eat
Your sorry baby daddy
Only transportation fee
For still holding onto a pipe dream you is wrong
The fat lady ain't gonna come
She done already song
(fa la la..fa la laa)

[Outro]
She’ll already sung baby, like real talk you gotta understand sumn
I mean, it’s cool for you to want some dick and yea he’ll uck the shit out you
But bitch you gotta handle your priorities
Can’t be missing work
Cause you want to get a nut
What the fuck wrong you
Ain't glad you shhh..shhhh
