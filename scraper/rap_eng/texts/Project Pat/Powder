Powder Gets You Hyper, Gets You Hyper, Gets You Hype, Gets You Hyper
Still 44 Parking lot I'm at the mall
Across the street, behind your gun, dislocating your jaw
Gots that one hitta quitta, them stars all you saw
Just your average street fool with a nose full of Raw
Take a pause for a minute heart beating through my chest
Simple robbery can turn into a true bloody mess
Guess he didn't understand that I had to gone get my man
Powder head Ross in the trap snortin up the grams
Man they had me posted up, just in case the jackers came
Pay me money for my services? Nah. I want Cocaine
Came to me all night, with the place full of Powder
Didn't have a thought of Blow, so I had to use the dollar
Powder Gets you Hyper, Gets You Hyper, Gets You Hype, Gets You Hyper
See the madness in me drained out the "Cain, " what I came for
Having mood swings kinda Koo Koo for the Cocoa
Choppin' down the flaky chunks, so white like Irish Soap
You didn't catch a good dream, must a had some bad Blow
Not from me though, cause the Kid got that Whitney White
Takin' 20 Xanax pills to bring you down off this high
Eyeballs big and glossy, wide like on "Cough-Fee" up all night snortin' can't sleep like on coffee
At the room with my Snow Bunny and we Blowing
Got a girlfriend with it too, and she Going
A school teacher balked and she just started hoeing
Good Coke will have you hittin' broads like you Rollin'
Powder Gets You Hyper, Gets You Hyper, Gets You Hype, Gets You Hyper...
