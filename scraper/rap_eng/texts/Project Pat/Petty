[Intro: Juicy J & Project Pat]
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Patta, Patta, Patta

[Hook: Project Pat]
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Just because my money longer than yours
My weed stronger than yours
I'm still slammin' foreign doors and fuck all of these whores
These niggas mad, wish they was doin' the shit I'm doin'
She lookin' for a relationship, I'm lookin' for the chewin'
Street shit, get you untied, I'm trying to get you laid
Some dreams turn to nightmares, feds touched his page
Slangin' H, I done moved shit, made from state to state
Niggas and bitches want you locked up dead call that (?)
You can lose your place, tryna worry 'bout my plate
Tryna take off my plate, shot his ass in the face
Petty ass niggas make a rich nigga catch a case
Petty ass niggas make a rich nigga catch a case

[Chorus: Juicy J]
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings

[Verse 2: GO]
These bitches be doing the most
Stop callin' my phone with the drama
Blowin' me up, you bad as Osama bitch, but you ain't my momma
Get out yo' feelings, get you some business stop worryin' 'bout me and my partners
You making me sick, if I had a wish I wish you would keep it 100
And niggas is worse than the hoes
Flirt with yo' bitch on the low
Diss you when you ain't around
And then they be like what up bro
Bust in yo' pockets, countin' your money like they was the IRS
I don't care about what another man do my nigga that's why I'm blessed
I get straight to it say less
Got now my foot on they neck
I live my life, no stress
Got niggas in check like chess
Niggas wish they could be me but you ain't ready nigga
They just want some shit for free so I can't fuck with all these

[Chorus: Juicy J]
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings
All these petty niggas, and these petty bitches
I can't tell the difference, I can't tell the difference
Bitch get out yo' feelings, get out yo' feelings
Get out yo' feelings, bitch get out yo' feelings

[Interlude: Juicy J]
Get out your motherfuckin' feelings man
You know what I'm sayin'
Can't stand a petty motherfucker man
Fuck 'em

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Bitches wanna set you up
Just to get their paper up
Niggas wanna take you down
Plottin' when you not around
Gotta keep it pimpin', pay attention, niggas really clowns
You can't show 'em everythin', niggas never seen a pound
You do what they dream about
Got these niggas schemin' now
Everything dope, and you got these bitches fiendin' now
When you got your bread up, gotta keep your head up
Niggas out here talkin' to them people cause they fed up
Either way it go don't put yo' trust in niggas
Put my faith in God, I don't fuck with niggas
I don't even conversate with sucka niggas
At the end of the day I don't play, I don't fuck with all these petty niggas
