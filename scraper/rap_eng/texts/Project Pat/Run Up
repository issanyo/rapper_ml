Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, broad daylight with no mask
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, give me all yuh cash
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass Broad daylight with no mask
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, give me all yuh cash

[Verse: 1]
Mane I seen a nigga at the ATM
Making a withdrawal
Thinking to myself this 38 will make you shit drop
It was 1 am at night
With nobody else around
I was at the Popeyes across the street
Sipping on some crown
In the drive through
Waiting on a number three
Smoking on a loud blunt
Loaded heater on the seat
This bitch handed me the chickens
Snatch the bag and pulled off
Tryin’ to catch this mother fucking nigga ‘fore he pulled off
So I crept up next to his car
This trick by his self
He was on them 24 them TV's sitting in headrests
Keys in the ignition
He got a phone up to his ear
Walking out the ATM
So I put my car in gear
Revved it down
Hopped up out the car
I could see his spirit
Heart beating fast
I could see the smile disappear
I’m like nigga drop the cash off
Motherfucking sad talk
Need to cooperate
Before I’ll blow your ass off

[Hook]
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, broad daylight with no mask
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, give me all yuh cash
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass Broad daylight with no mask
Don’t make me run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass (Run up)
Run up on yuh ass, give me all yuh cash

[Verse: 2]
On my mark, ready set, go
Running to the cheese
Gotta eat
I ain't greedy
I just gotta sleep with ease
If you owe me something
Just don’t owe me nothing while I’m hurtin’
Cause I may just lay you down
That’s for  motherfucking certain
Close curtain on a nigga ask, fuck just how you feelin
Ain't no chillin’
It’s a killin’
‘bout that, dollar billy
That’s for really
Knew a bitch
Kept her baby daddy [?]
And she got money in the attic, I don’t suppose to know
Hit the bitch up
One night I told her all kinda shit
Bludgeon like I like this bitch [?]
She telling me she want this dick
I’m on the way I hit the strip
She on the other side of  town
I back up in the driveway
Had to turn the pimpin’ down
Open up the door immediately
I guess she seen them headlights
Sat upon the couch
Asked her what the headlight
Pulled out that main
Then I start to burn her brain
Then I put revolver to her head and told her to give me everythin’
