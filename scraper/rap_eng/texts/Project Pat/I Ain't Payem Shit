[Verse 1]
All that yapping and that talking pussy, go and get you gun
Cuz Project Pat staying heated up like the sun
Could have got your lil money started running your tongue
When you see me nigga pull your gun I ain't the one
We grew up like brothers, granny house playing lego
But I'm Michael Corleone and you a rat like Fredo
I'm a tiger shark boy you a fucking guppy
An OG pitbull you a fucking puppy
I'm all about them Benjamin's like Ice Cube
My goons jump you like a chicken put you on YouTube
Cuz you ain't gon' do shit but gon' run your lip-a
I'ma tell you like this I ain't paying shit-a

[Hook]
I ain't payin' him shit (x4)
I know I owe this nigga money
I ain't payin' him shit
I know I owe this nigga money
I ain't payin' him shit

[Verse 2]
In the streets niggas cross like a intersection
Choppa bullets on yo ass up like C section
When them robbers hit yo pockets up like a recession
Come up on anything out here a street missing
Niggas say what they gon' do, that's baloney
I'm out here buying George blowing loud with the homies
Cuz I ain't gotta talk myself in to retaliation
Cuz they should have but the [?]
Like a dick in the junkie bitches mouth
Sprinkle they pockets and like babies they gon' pow
I ain't sleeping on em .45 move the crowd
Extendo clip on and whip still blowing loud

[Hook]
