[Hook]
Smokin out like Chief Wahoo hoo
Chase it down with the liquor and brew brew
Pass it round that's the way we do do
Somebody get this dope cause I'm through through

[Project Pat]
Roll up a blunt like light up the green
Eyes red as fire I'm on promethazine
Roll up another one dipped in the sizzurp
Save it for later mane cause it wouldn't h-izz-urt
Soon as the thunder enters my lungs-ah
I start gettin hungry wheres that bologna
Crackers and cheese zuzus and whams
Icy white honey bun ooohh there I am
Go an light another one constantly smokin'
Turn up a 45 drankin and chokin
Started smoking weed real young with my peers
So full of dope smoke comin out my ears
Burnt fingernails ain't made no sales
Ya'll might be short an ounce or two on them scales
To hell with that fool go an take a pull
We cheefin all night and we stay gettin food

Chorus x2

[Lord Infamous]
You ask if Lord were a drug a drug
Ay what drug would Lord be he be
Yo Lord would be a pound of weed
But no stems no sticks no seeds
It's just because I believe-ah in cannabis sativa
In my L-U-N-G-S I keep the sticky green-ah
Puffahontas puff a peace pipe ridin on my peet-ah
Whats my favorite flower? It's that marijuana leaf-ah
I keep-ah, uh, the L the O the R the D
I be on the B-L the U-N-T
I brew a cup of shrooms and break down the B-A-G ah
Purple kush pretty bush Cheech n Chong in me-ah
I'm the Scarecrow me in the Ville protecting acres
Smoke it out the bong, a swisher leaf, yes even papers

Chorus x2
