[Hook]
I don’t fuck with broke niggas
They don’t like that
I tell ‘em get up out my face
Yea, it’s like that
The old  man cause I gon hit em right back
I spent it all, when I’m ballin’, get it right back
I get it right back
They don’t like that
I spent it all, when I’m ballin’, get it right back
I tell ‘em get up out my face
Yea, it’s like that
I spent it all, when I’m ballin’, get it right back

[Verse:1]
[?] living like a boss dude
Levels to this shit I’m certified I’m making boss moves
Everybody ain't your friend, these niggers are cross shoe
Take nothing from those ogees[?]
Remember what they taught you
Fuck niggas they floss too?
Every nigga with a bank roll ain’t real
I cut my own cheque
And you niggas really don’t don’t know how that feel
I’ve been on that racist shit
Been breaking the law bitch[?]
Being [?] can’t cost your life
But been real don’t cost you shit
And nigga you ain’t a boss
If you ain't took no loss
You gotta lose before you win
And crawl before you walk
Always remember that your word is all that you got
Let your niggas get some money
See how quick they ask

Yea, it’s like that
I spent it all, when I’m ballin’, get it right back

[Verse: 2]
