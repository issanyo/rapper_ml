[Hook: Akon]
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
Team make money, motherfucker, I'm the mascot
Crib in the city and a crib up in Aspen
Swiss account and consider that the cash spot
Billi' and I ain't gonna stop, no, nigga
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man
I'm a self made man, self made man

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Self made, anthem of my life, where the marching band?
Montana, I bes the bomb like the Taliban
Popping like a frying pan, slide like a violin
Through the crackhole, blindfold like a telescan
Most underrated but never underpaid
Fake niggas mad and all the real niggas glad he made it
Gladiator, baby, don't be acting shady, baby
Seeing niggas shining through the diamonds trying to see me, baby
I'm the product, get that product, baby, serving dog
Fucking with the hottest so the hottest I deserved the ball
It's that Cocaine Mafia connect
Juicy J, Project Pat, Montana, roger that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I done did what I had to, grind on my own two
Feet from the street with the killers and the real goons
Watching out for popo, trying to sell the yayo
Trying to be the weed man, even selling beans, man
I'ma always stand out, I don't take no handouts
But I take you're money bruh, run up in your gram's house
I hustle till I die with the rapping with the trapping
Whether be a hit man with the guns clapping
Coming straight from the hood, I'ma make it happen
I ain't never had shit, I had to sell or snatch it
Chrome three fifty seven got always packed in
That'll cut you're fucking head like a fucking hatchet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Self made, getting paid, went and found my own plug
Just like Frank Lucas did, went and got my own drugs
Taped up by my nuts on the plane, Cali buzz
Soon as I hit the hood, I ain't showing Cali love
Everything for the streets, nigga, gotta give me me
Five hundred dollars, ounce of purp, in these Memphis street
I done to made a kill-ion off of drug deal-ion
Rap about my life and I sold me a million
Mr. Gold Plate get raw then we pop ya
DB investments, Cocaine Mafia
Pistols and shotguns, grams of the heroin
Twenty-eights on the [?] got these Hummers [?]

[Hook]
