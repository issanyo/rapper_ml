[Intro: Juicy J]
Winners circle
We scrapin' up all this money man
The hustle continues

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us
I keep that money comin' in, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded
I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Man I'm blowing all this loud
I'll be damned to let a nigga take it
I'm a stoner wake and bake'n ain't no eggs and bacon
Plenty syrup, plenty loud, nigga you ain't heard
All this cake a nigga makin', better than desert
Keep that chopper on alert
Bombay quench my thirst
All these dead presidents I'ma need a hearse
I'm getting faded, I'm so high
Bout to spark, Captain Kirk
Wastin' weed, in my lap, tryna roll up but I swerve
You say you not sucking dick, bitch you got some nerve
Put this condom on your ear hoe fuck what you heard
I'm the shit, you just a turd, you ain't shit mark my words
Got bitches who give me brain 'til I'm a nerd

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us
I keep that money comin' in, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded
I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
They try to talk about me cause I'm always staying positive
Ridin' clean she wakin' up and cleanin' thats just how I live
Niggas busy stressin', I'm just smokin' weed and takin' shots
Gotta keep the proper medication cause I think a lot
Fresh out the jacuzzi smokin' doobies in my Ksubis
Face time her bring her to the trap to watch some movies
Netflix, champagne, Apple TV
Best believe its going down, you fuckin' with a, G

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us
I keep that money comin' in, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded
I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Scrape it up, scoop it up
We just tryna pile it up
Buying drugs where I'm from
You might get fucked like a slut
Medical cali in my lungs, hustlers hold them rollies up
Gas get in my pockets fat, stuffed like a stromboli bruh
In the club sparkles on them bottles like fourth of July
Bookin' shows all the way to Mississipi all the way to the Dubai
Rollin papers smokin' like a hippie brains in the sky
Rari light, police ask me questions know I'ma lie
Cause I'm 100 like a Calico
Cigarillo full of medical
You know wheels off the credit bro
We poppin' bottles and we stackin' dough

[Hook: Juicy J]
I'm feelin' faded, and elevated
Buying everything so they can tell I made it
I'm rolling papers, they tryna' fade us
I keep that money comin' in, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it, I'ma scrape it
I'm rolling papers, man I'm faded
I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it,  I'ma scrape it
