[Intro]
Talkin smart [x8]

[Hook: Pimp C x4]
Talkin smart to a pimp, you done broke the first rule
You done broke the first rule
You done broke the first rule

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
You a smart mouth,gator mouth, out of pocket bitch
You done robbed your first pimp and tried to bring me his shit
Then choose a v10 bitch, all you got is 8
That's a nigga lifesavings, you a faggot he a fake bitch
I got too much cake plus
Bitch I'm on parole plus
Bitch I pimped this microphone my mouthpiece is too cold
She'll be stunned by some small change
Bitch, do you see this chain
Bitch, can't you see I got ya life in my pinky rang
Dope game cocaine, boy I done sold it all
No steel, running light, that I woop to ball
Now its only money, ain't no powder in my hundreds bills
See a pimp shine and bitch tell me how your pussy feels

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
A smart mouth freak with a mouth full of cum
Empty purse in your dome
All you got is bubblegum
Little girl is you trippin, Disrespectin pimpin
Coppin college square ho's, Mang then I'm flippin
Straight into turning tricks
Throw her in the snake pit
Shake ya booty wrestle with these guys
Bring me a grip
Trip if ya wanna tho
That'll get your jaw swole
Bring me the pot of gold, otherside of rainbow
Go insert liquid cum, Get it boy lil head
You wanna do it anyway
Might as well, make some bread
Scared!? say your scared (scared)
Or your face will get caved in
From a nigga knuckles, then your butt hit the pavement

[Hook]
