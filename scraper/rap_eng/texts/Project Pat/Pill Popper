[Intro]
Some people melt 'em down in a needle
And shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel
Like glue, I am stuck

See I'm a Pill Popper
So I'mma keep poppin' 'em
Gimme gimme 20 Xanax
And I'mma start droppin' 'em
Droppin' 'em, droppin' 'em

[Hook: Lil Wyte] 2x
See I'm a Pill Popper
And I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em (3x)
See I'm a Pill Popper
And I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em
Give me 20 Xanax
And I'mma start droppin' 'em

[Verse 1: Partee]
I've been fucking with Lil Wyte
Birds of same feathers flock together
Got me poppin Xanax Bars
Fuckin' up my sleep schedule
Popped a whole full bar
On the way to Japan
Woke up 13 hours later
With some Sake in my hand
Some of the best sleep
Your ass will ever get
But if you mix it with that liquor
I swear tomorrow you won't remember shit
Partee, King of BHZ
Suge Knight of Tennessee
Yea I'll let you free
When I drop you off that balcony, bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wyte]
Project Pat-ah whats that you poppin'?
It look like from here an 80 mili Oxycotton
And its so tiny, yet you're so fucking huge
By the end of the night
You're gonna be puking in your shoes
Take my word, they fuck me up
And have me wiggin out in panic
If I was your Doctor
I'd prescribe you a double dose of Xanax
I'm the man at this
I'll probably be popping till im dead and gone
Whatcha want, whatcha need
I still got a few connections
If you wanna buy my cion

[Bridge: Lil Wyte]
I'm a Pill Popper
(I'm a Pill Popper)
I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em
(I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em)
See I'm a Pill Popper
I'mma I'mma Pill Popper
Give me 20 Xanax and
I'mma start droppin' 'em

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
I can't feel my face
I need me some cold ice water
Blunts and them naked ladies
Not in that order
Swallow some Xanax
They make ya come down
Inhale the kush blunt
And blow it back out
The Loud, is something that we just
Gotta have like chrome rims
Every ride and alotta cash
Fast light, fast cars
X pills, bad broads
The way I live; in 5th gear
Call me Nascar

[Verse 4 Lord Infamous]
BLAY!
Go on and throw me 6 Xanax bars, I'm ready to get full
3-4 times they said I had enough in me to kill a bull
They say that I should sober up, but thats the thing I cannot figure
Infamous heard all my life to never ever be a quitter
If he sip it, sniff it, pop it, smoke it - Scarecrow need it potent
Huffing on this ice got Scarecrow up for days, peepin' and scopin'
Rappers claim they get down, but they scared to touch a cigarette
Check my resume, I can get anything you want bitch

[Hook: Lil Wyte] 2x
See I'm a Pill Popper
And I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em (3x)
See I'm a Pill Popper
And I'mma I'mma keep poppin' 'em
Give me 20 Xanax
And I'mma start droppin' 'em
