[Verse 6: Juicy J]
I meet this litte fr-freak from the stre-street
A sexy fine white girl that i ke-ke-keep
She had me up all-ervy night
ATM credit she-she swiped
She dressed in plastic i gotta ha-have it
She say sprung a neighboorhood addict
Ain't no rehab that can stop me
She looked like expresso coffee
When shes in yo system she'll keep you crunk
And make you buck like walk off in the back with guns out
Make em give it up
She keep your heart beat real fast
Down four make her hotta
Every time i see her she with me 40 and my dollar

[Verse 7: DJ Paul]
Yeah Yeah yeah yeah the king of the motherfuckin m-town
See I reck you haters like i reck this cars
Then I Then I trade it in like i trade this broads
Walk up Walk up out the square with nan fucking squire
Lookin lookin like my 4 still shinin like a star
See sucka i'm a vet not a vetenarian
Get rid of your flesh like if i was a vegetarian
Fuck em fuck em feed em bullets
Let the ball bat carry em
Till their fuckin fuckin family
Then i'm gonna bury them
I told them i was the king but they didn't wanna believe me
Till the bullets hit em and they started to bleeding
Boy you a lesser not even a guester
When we started leakin up your shirt thats a guesser
You realized that i wasn't playin with your plan
You realized you have the wrong fuckin man
Finally figured out that your on the wrong fucking land
9 to the whole town we ain't playin
