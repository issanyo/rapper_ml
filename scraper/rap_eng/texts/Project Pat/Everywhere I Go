[Intro]
Shit be like this E’ry where I go
It’s really something
You heard me

[Hook]
I see a fuck nigga, everywhere I go
I pull a bad bitch, everywhere I go
I see a ‘hoe’ I fucked,  everywhere I go
I kiss my money up,  everywhere I go
They respect me,  everywhere I go
Guns with extendos,  everywhere I go
I be with chicks beat,  everywhere I go
I’m always flexing,  everywhere I go

[Verse 1]
City to city, every time I do a show
Best believe I’m tryin’ to break the bank, fifty or ‘moe’
I get paid to show up, man is slow
Rollin’ kelly in my swish, inhale all the smoke
Its at least two or three niggas who hate dough
Why you suckers worry ‘bout me
You need to worry ‘bout your dogs or your ‘hoe’
Cause she choose it and I’m a let her...hmmm
Not a lame in this buildings eighty of a mello
I hit another city, hit the streets, like it’s mines
Ran through the hood and gon’ get up with my kind
Everywhere I go I meet a nigga that’s lyin’
Oh I hold it ain’shit a niggas on that grind

[Hook]
I see a fuck nigga, everywhere I go
I pull a bad bitch, everywhere I go
I see a ‘hoe’ I fucked,  everywhere I go
I kiss my money up,  everywhere I go
They respect me,  everywhere I go
Guns with extendos,  everywhere I go
I be with chicks beat,  everywhere I go
I’m always flexing,  everywhere I go

[Verse: 2]
Pat a hoe on my line
Bitches on my dick
Police pick the  grind
They know I’m with this shit
I got money on my mind
I gots to get rich...hmmm
I ain't acting funny
I just getting on  my shit
Like bees on honey
I beez on my money
No love for these hoes
I love these honeys
Permit and these trees keep me blunny
Money talks so you broke nigga sayin’ nothing
They gon’ come running when they need yuh
When you get fucked up then they get amnesia
If you get locked up who comin’ to see yuh
When you hungry who the niggas who gonna feed yuh
I don’t need yuh

[Hook]
I see a fuck nigga, everywhere I go
I pull a bad bitch, everywhere I go
I see a ‘hoe’ I fucked,  everywhere I go
I kiss my money up,  everywhere I go
They respect me,  everywhere I go
Guns with extendos,  everywhere I go
I be with chicks beat,  everywhere I go
I’m always flexing,  everywhere I go
