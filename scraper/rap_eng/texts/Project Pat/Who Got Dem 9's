[Verse 1: Juicy J]
We's creepin' through your hood
Makin' you ho ass niggas jump
With them doubts somebody hear shots
Got you shakin', call the cops
When the cops got on the scene
All they heard was cries and screams
Triple 6 niggas are mean
When they blast them triple beams
Seem to me you never learn
So we have to demonstrate
Motherfuck a murder case
Shot the bitch off in his face
Face it ho and be a man
Play the game until the end
You was out there claimin' killa
So to hell, with your friends
All your foes, I suppose
You think I'mma let you live
No love was never shown
So no love is what I give
Get respect off in these streets
Stayin' real, packin' heat
Some don't wanna see me have
Always out tryin' to creep
On the next, do I flex
With them techs, Let em' kill
Those with anna on your chest
We gon' make your blood spill
We for reall off in this shit
If you jump we gon' clown
Put a bullet in your head
And lay your body in the ground


[Hook: Juicy J & Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
It's gangsta it's gangsta
Everybody wanna be a dealer, a killa
Violate and you gon' be a body in lobby
Ghetto life is ghetto past the blastin'
And askin', for that fuckin' loot
And then I'm dashin', harrassin'
If you real
Then you respect the real one
I feel some
Niggas need to have a chat with Nina, The Enforcer
187 soldiers in this motha
I'll smother those who thnk they bolder than no other
A buster gon' lose his fuckin' life up in this gizzame
I'll dusta gets right upside your head
And blow your brizzains to pieces
And even if it's your time to clock those Glocks down
So watch out
Wasn't raised to be no ho, I'm takin' my Glock down
And motherfuck police
Cause when it's on
Bitch it's murder
So go and get your toes and your click
And I'mma serve ya
I urge ya, don't be lookin' at my face dog
Watch the 9 r-e-s-p-e-c-t
Oh, you gon' give me mine
