[Hook: Veo]
Posted in the back so they know not the start with us
And we smoking good, everybody know we sparking up
Your lady's MIA but don't trip because they all with us
Living life fine, yeah we so fucking marvelous
So fucking marvelous
So fucking marvelous
So fucking marvelous
So fucking marvelous

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Purple Weed in my system
Eyes like an Asian
Ciroq bottles, plenty models, the occasion
At the club, it's the weekend, so we drankin'
Broads bouncing booty in the club like they freakin'
Twerk Twerk Twerk Twerk Twerk Twerk Twerk that
Hit her in the bed, open legs, I'ma murk that
Project Pattah, down south to the midwest
Keep a strappah, shoot the charm off a niggas chest
Where the slugs go, I'm a pro, official damn mac
Feeding jelly beans to your gal, sitting in the back
After that, parking lot pimpin', 26 inches
Diamond chain glisten, I just wanna holla at a chicken

[Verse 2: Yo! Ayy. TEE.]
Smoking hash with a oneie
Chilling where it's sunny
A lot of bad bitches and a whole lot of money
Take a few pills just to keep it X-rated
In my bedroom I got your bitch butt naked
Nigga just face it, don't try to save her
Let her hit the blunt she's in love with the flavor
Getting to the paper, life is amazing
Ask me how I feel, bitch this is what I'm saying
Marvelous, marvelous, yeah I feel marvelous
Gone in 60 seconds, guarantee she in the car with us
Hit her on tour, now I call her road kill
Put the money on the table cuz I'm tryna get a mil
This bitch, that ho, ho let me see the pussy
Make that ass clap, drop it low, then give it to me
I got that thing on me so please don't play
I lay the smack down like Mr. Don't Play
If you're wondering who I am, I am Yo! Ayy. TEE

[Verse 3: Veo]
Now let's make like an ass and just shake the whole spot
Or just make like the beat, earthquake the whole block
You come to unharbor us, we never ever stop
And I guarantee Mikey ain't the only who that rocks
Stop, yeah I took your girl, homie why you furious
Yeah we're getting money over here, why you so curious
Haters just be looking with a mug that is so serious
Better bring your suit and tie cuz I'mma show what the business is
Wait
It's missed up, what the issue is
Got your girl blowing me, like a tissue, kid
And I'm just getting rid of our differences
So sit up and act right while I teach you this
Step back, ball with us
Boy your girls, they all with us
Yeah dude you're cool but ain't nobody coming hard as us
Everybody talk to us, leaders now they follow us
Got me feeling like a hero by the way that they all marvel us
