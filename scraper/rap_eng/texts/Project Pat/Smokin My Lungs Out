Smoking my lungs out
I'm just smoking my lungs out (x3)
I just stay high (high) (x8)

[verse 1]
Crumble down the kush, lets roll it up
Put the weed to the flame, lets fire it up
Don't put leaving none of these bitches, they lired up
All these niggas are Cali dog, they wired up
My pockets like Nappy Pur, its their naughty up
Unknown car come around my hood, like a junkie arm shotty up
Fuck these sluts, stack your bucks
I like ice, I like cream
Fallowing rides and bad bitches, popping pills and sipping lean
And we gon' smoke that peace pipe like King Mo Sabe
A nigga mask stay blowed 12 gauge shotty
I'm staying lit like a light bulb call me Edison
The weed mane like the doctor I need my medicine

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Studio session California weed blessing
Me and Lil Awree blowing gas and lit Ferrari
Some Khalifa Kush some of that OG mash
Keep our weed in jars, smoking bout a glass
Take a pool of some of this good
Riding foreign in the hood
My nigga just murked his bitch for riding foreign wood
Say it ain't so but my nigga that's how it goes
This loud got me turnt up like I'm on some blow
Ice on wrist got a gliss like I hustle snow
Start smoking now you ain't shit you lost your dough
Inhaling marijuana leaves like a vacuum cleaner
I love the sour lemon, I call it mustard green

[Hook]
