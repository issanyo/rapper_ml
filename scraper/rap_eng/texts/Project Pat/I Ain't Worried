[Hook]
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes

[Verse 1]
Nigga you's a fool lettin' these hoes run your life
Bob Barker pimpin' she can fuck me if the price is right
[?] all night, new paint, on a brand new Jag
I'm in love with my money
Ain't no fallin' for you scalawags
Took a lot of losses on my journey to the top
Made a promise to myself, like a pistol I'ma pop
Fuck a watch
Leave it at the house 'cause I ain't got no time
To be worried 'bout no hoes, I got money on my mind
I don't care 'bout nothin but you fine
Hoe my check look even betta'
That's my bottom bitch cuffin' plenty hoes and I let her
I want the chedda'
I want guap, I need cheese
I need bread
New Versace bucket hat
I got money on my head

[Hook]
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes

[Verse 2]
I'm back on them bricks, [?] the shit
Cuffin' this cheese, makin' these flips
Makin' these plays, sellin' these [?]
Them price of the pills, I'm doin' this shit
Fucked on plenty bitches, made plenty plays
Had beef with plenty niggas, and shot plenty K's
Young niggas' wild let me say they goin' through a phase
I'm Gorilla Glue, I'm so stuck in my ways
Allergic to you suckas
My temper is short
My chopper he the judge, in the street having court
You crossed me [?]
Their ain't no repentance
Snitched then lied that's a ma'fuckin death sentence
Mother fuck a bitch
I'm gettin' to this money mane
We got the shit up out the mud ain't nothin' funny mane

[Hook]
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm too busy tryna get a check
Gold 'round my neck
Watch me flex
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on my bread
Only thing a hoe can do is let me go n' burn her head
I ain't worried 'bout these hoes
