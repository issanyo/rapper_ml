Hypnotize Minds, Project Pat, the #1 ringtone!
It's goin' down!

Don't call me no more, and don't text me no mo

[Chorus: x2]
[Diamond:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Project Pat:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Diamond:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Both:]
Cause I'm through with ya! 'Cause I'm through with ya!

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
I ain't discussin nuthin' you can go on hit the door
Get up out of my ride, I forgot you aw forget ya
Let the chevy door hit ya where the good Lord split ya
I ain't with that instant messagin', callin' and textin'
Saw me on them 30s downtown, Hummer flexin'
These broads that be beggin', ice around my neck and
A hood nigga hustlin' gonna get my respectin'
There ain't no acceptin yo calls, so ya see your daddy
Yo moms, yo aunt, greasy greasy grand mammy
Like a Johnny Cochran team to try to plead your case
Heard ya in the background hung up in they face

[Chorus: x2]
[Diamond:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'

Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'

Cause I'm through with ya! 'Cause I'm through with ya!

I ain't got time 2 hit her, numba 3 times 4 1 letta

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
All I want is a D-boy datz heavy in the game

'Cause they call me Juicy J, and I be lookin 4 sum brain

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 4: Project Pat]
What you textin' me for, 4AM in the night
And you knowin' that we through, need some wood in yo life?
Don't be booty callin' me, you can keep yo legs closed
Neva get this thang again, fo yo coochie'll throw
Used to be a glamour queen 'cause I kept you with some money
I done cut yo water off, now you like a dust bunny
Hoody Hoody hood rat, nuck yo booty real fat
I'm in love with a stripper, let me hit it from the back
Like this girl Lil' Red, stood me up on some head
She come callin' me now, found out I got that bread
Little girls that be scared, go to church and hit the door
Don't call me no mo' and don't text... me (Wind Down)

[Chorus: x2]
[Diamond:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Project Pat:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Diamond:]
Don't call me no mo' and don't text me no mo'
[Both:]
Cause I'm through with ya! 'Cause I'm through with ya!
