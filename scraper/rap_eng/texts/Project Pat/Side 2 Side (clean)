Yeah... This a dance song for all my niggas in the club
That don't dance... Just be in the back arms folded...
Blunt in the mouth... Cap pulled down just scopin everythang
KnowhatI'msayin? Just in da cut... Watchin you haters
With a tone on em...

(Chorus)(DJ Paul)
I'm in the club posted up (up) got my arms folded
Blunt in my mouth and these haters I'm scopin I'm just
Twistin my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twistin my body from side 2 side
I'm in the club posted up (up) got my arms folded
Fitted pulled down and these haters I'm scopin I'm just
Twistin my body from side 2 side (I'm just)
Twistin my body from side 2 side

(Crunchy Blac)
I'm in the club I'm posted up
A nigga talk shit so talk up
If you a thug then get buck
Muthafucka it's whatever with me cuzz
I act a fool I act a clown
See I can dance lil buddy I get down
You hear my music you know my style
You hear the way Hypnotize put it down
BITCH!

(Juicy J)
I thought you knew I was the mane (mane) D-boy off the chain (chain)
Gon walk up to a girl tell a bitch I'm Rick James (James)
Wit the diamonds in my rang (rang) and gold point fangs (fangs)
And you know I'm hood rich means I got a lil change (change)
Wit my thugs from the North cause I know they got my back
Lookin for some chickens that can work it on the track

Posted up in the club wit a pocket full of crack

(Chorus)(DJ Paul)
