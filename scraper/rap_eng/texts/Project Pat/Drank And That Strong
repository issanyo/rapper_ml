[Verse 1]
Smoking blunts back to back, 350 for a sack
Cup full of purple jolly ranchers, a whole pack
Yellow Tuss got me slow and this molly got her loose
Looking like a forest fire, blowing pounds of that kush
Lungs full of good weed, getting money out the mud
Cali love, Cali bud
Fell in love with the plug
I got throwed off the drank, doze off about an hour
A smoking-ass trippy nigga to the ninth power
Blowing strong and that loud at the same damn time
Drinking Tuss and that Actavis, trippy out my mind
Say I need to slow down, bitch you need to mind your business
Rolling Swishers out the pack, sipping drank, handling business
Feeling like I'm lost in space, left my mind on the moon
Half a zip ain't enough I need a whole damn [?]
Man I'm faded to the max, fell asleep on the phone
Got my swishers and my cup, bad bitch I'm headed home

[Hook]
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong
I'm on that drank and that strong
That drank and that strong

[Verse 2]
Cheech and Chong on the phone
Keep a player in his zone
Sucker free spend a G
But this all just for me
Blowing bands and strands of that good Cali reefer
Passing blunts with Wiz Khalifa
Got that Pimp C in my cup
Yeah that Texas tea, Bun B
What I'm smoking OG
Chinky-eyed China man when they come and find me
Always keep a liter put that lean on some ice
This a first class ticket 'bout to take a trippy flight
Short days long nights
Got a pimp feeling right
She said 'what's that in your cup? You sipping syrup?' Damn right
Got a quarter-pound of strong blow it all in one night
Get your papers and your blunts, bone smokers or a pipe
Blue dream got me floating cup full of dirty sprite
Living a rockstar life
Don't remember last night
Certified trippy niggas doing this every night
If I wasn't getting money niggas swear I was aight

[Hook]
