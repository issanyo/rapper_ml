"Racket Freestyle"
[Intro]
Patta
It's Gucci Savage Baaaby
Remix Baaaby
Yeahhhhh
I Think I Just Blak'd Out


[Chorus] (Gucci Savage)
Vac it
Pack it
Ship it out and Track it
Get this money in
Get this money in
They say I run a racket
They say I run a racket
Vac it then I pack it
Ship it out and Track it
I get this money in
They say I run a racket


[Verse 1] (Gucci Savage)
They forget who putem on
Who Put you on BAAABY?
It's that dapper don
Runnin trapathons
Till the break of dawn
I just vac and pack and ship
And track it like I'm Amazon
THATS PRIME
Thats why these MotherF****
Hatin longer than the day is long
Why yall boys keep on hatin?
I'm movin packs with Project Pat
Dope Money
What you know about that
I'm ridin clean with dirty sticks
Linked up with the mafia thirty six
Everywhere I go
I'm fresher than a fashion show blowin' dro
They say I'm runnin' a racket
But they dont even know
Yee ain't even know


[Chorus]  (Gucci Savage)
Vac it
Pack it
Ship it out and Track it
Get this money in
Get this money in
They say I run a racket
They say I run a racket
Vac it then I pack it
Ship it out and Track it
I get this money in
They say I run a racket


[Verse 2] (Project Pat)
Flippin' bread like a burger
F*ck with mines and its murder
Like a waiter at Applebees
Man I'm quick to serve ya
Pull up with the bread
And its curb service
Don't be scared
Don't be actin  and lookin' nervous
Clean off the red
Guess Imma book some shows
Cleanin' off my dick head
That be these freaky hoes
With the trigger sqooze
Then the bullets fire
Gotta watch you lame ducks
Yall be wearin wires
My polo man is green like a gecko

[Outro]
Vac it
Pack it
Ship it out and Track it
Get this money in
They say I run a racket
They say I run a racket
