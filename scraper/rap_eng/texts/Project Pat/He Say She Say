[Intro]

[Hook]
He say, she say that shit end up in gun play
Motherfuck what he say and motherfuck what she say
He say, she say can take the shit the wrong way
Gun play, gun play  that shit end up in gun play
He say, she say that shit end up in gun play
Motherfuck what he say and motherfuck what she say
He say, she say can take the shit the wrong way
Gun play, gun play  that shit end up in gun play

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
He say, she say that shit can get a nigga hit
Bullets talk to everybody nigga when the chopper spit
You boys do a lot talking motherfuck you niggas
Ain't gon' shake shit like a scary stripper
These niggas talk loud but they ain't making funds
You fuck boys disappear like smoke out my lungs
When was young I was hustlin' bricks to the [crungs?]
I look like the don look like you got the wrong
How can you stomach all them lies all that bullshit
Know you ain't new be 'round no talk I'm no cool wit'
20 pounds of reggie 12 each now that's a cool flip
Fake niggas who talk shit get shot in the lip

[Hook]

[Verse 2. Project Pat]
He say, she say now these niggas turn rat
Tellin' all these FED's all these bogus ass facts
Gettin' real niggas ass blowed clean off the map
Gettin' niggas flexed off and getting niggas jacked
Automatic guns caught you coming out the club
Rolled up on your parking lot shot you in your ugly mug
Bullets pop niggas duck down leave the place
That's why nobody could identify the shooters face
I do business with any race, I don't discriminate
Cross me then it's murder charge, let the money fight the case
Yeah, it's money train game nigga ain't no looking back
Foreign whip and stendo's in the clip and in the duffle bag
Now I know you niggas sad know you niggas pop your seats
Supposed to be so damn gangsta you ain't gon' make a lick
You strapped like a tank or sum, rob a bank or sum
Your ship about to sink my nig' you better thank of sum

[Hook]
