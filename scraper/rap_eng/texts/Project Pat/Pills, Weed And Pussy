[Verse 1: Project Pat]
We smoking out the cigar
The pipe or the bong
Dranking cold white liquor
She might not come home
Purple moons, pink ladies, blue dolph'o'ns
Chasing with some orange jucie
Then I'm 'bouts to get loose
As a goose, on the deuce
Put the back and grab the seat
Hoes blinded, black and yellow diamonds shining off my watch
Like to rocking Jay-Z
Project Pat is D-B-I
Foreign rides, duffle bags of breadstain Cali high

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
See me out here getting this money, paper cheddar ya know I hustle
I'ma use my brain, I'ma rub my game, I'ma work my muscle
So when I'm off, I'm tryna unwind, tryna have a good time
Take some of this bread I made on the grind and I'm gonna get high
Just like a college kid waving to his momma bye bye
I'm so so gone off in my zone, lames don't blow my high
Cuz when I'm on them drugs and drank I'm horny as a toad
I'm tryna see which one of you freaky hoes gonna go
