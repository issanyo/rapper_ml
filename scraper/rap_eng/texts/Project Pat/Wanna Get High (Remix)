[Hook x2: Joe Simpson]
I just wanna get high, high high
I just wanna get high
I just wanna stay high, high, high
I just wanna stay high

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
These niggas say I smoke out too much
These niggas say I pop pills too much
These niggas say I drank liquor too much
Ain't no such thing as too much
Blunt number 8 roll up again
Pass me the tab pass me the hen
When I get through I'ma do it all again
I'm on cloud 9 and I'm head at the 10
Is you mad or no
Cali Bud on dick had to blow
Smoke in my lungs blow half a bowl
I'm chiefing all day if you have to know
You get mad or you go
[?] make it burn slow
I'm mad as hell cuz my eyes real low
Looking just like Bruce Lee right now
You wanna be high as me right now
I got a bitch that don't smoke
She just rolling shit and light it up
I could give a damn what anybody says
I keep it on deck I ain't hiding
I don't wanna come down
I don't wanna come down
Its hard to explain this feeling I feel
But truth be told I don't even know what day it is
And I just wanna get high

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
6 deuce coupe
I don't ride in it unless I smoke in it first
Go to sleep early, wake up early
Just to get it
The grind all depends on how much time you spend perfecting it
But niggas always hate, come from nowhere with that extra shit
Let em lie, dig they own ditch
California king size
Harley lay in it
I'm proof that if you want it
You can get it
Champagne for breakfast, taste is expensive
Super paid, uber escalade
For my woman friends
Wanna be it, gotta see it
Extra lighter where my seat at
Pair of nines where my feet at
Brought the papers, where the weed at

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
This shit is potent
One hit of this strong I promise you will be choking
Gotta stay focused
I'm burning my fingers and even put out the roaches
I'm just floating
I'm in outer space I feel out of place when I'm high
And I'm gonna stay like this til I die
I'm gonna stay high, high, high, high, high
Blowing shotguns to a bad bitch
Throw good bucks cuz I'm mad rich
They zone out on the airway
They don't know shit about Babbage
You must have forgot I'm a savage
Marijuana my medicine
I got Christmas trees it ain't Christmas town
Each time I go to where I've never been
My doctor said it ain't good for your lungs but its good for my mind and it keeps me calm
Mary Jane she got me sprung
And she had my heart since a nigga was young
I don't wanna come down
Its hard to explain this feeling I feel
My nigga I'm throwed but truth be told
I don't even know what day it is I just wanna get high
