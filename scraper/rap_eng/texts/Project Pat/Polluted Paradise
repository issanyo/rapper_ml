This ain’t no game nigga
How in the fuck you figga
You try punkin' us you’ll feel the blast out my trigga
Straight out the honeycomb, smoking on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back then the body stack
This ain’t no game nigga
How in the fuck you figga
You try punkin' us you’ll feel the blast out my trigga
Straight out the honeycomb, smoking on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back then the body stack
This ain’t no game nigga
How in the fuck you figga
You try punkin' us you’ll feel the blast out my trigga
Straight out the honeycomb, smoking on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back then the body stack

[Verse 1: Chetta]
Fill up my cup to the tip its a must
I'ma pour over the rim two cock with the tuss
I can mix the combination
Lil' tech, lil' Act
Show up deep like conversation
Let me live, let me act
Real talk, vision vivid I've of seen body bags
Toe for toting any victim
I done shook killa's hands
Talking money over grams
Trapping bricks over saran
Couple homies of the 10
Ay you out? You a fan
Well I'll be god damned
But god dont exist so I guess its just damn
From a whole 'nother planet
Hopping out the transit
I'm smokey the bandit
Swerving in my spaceship
Tipping in my stash shit
They can not relate shit
Never on no fake shit
Lames wanna jump shit
Stack them up like 'roids bitch

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Swerving in that 'burban
Couple murders make them bodies stack
Got a problem then kill me fuckboy
You know its as simple as that
Back pack, with that black gat
Black mask
Blow gas now I'm in the fucking black trans
Fuck a cop save the life of a black man
Fuck a opp tip them up in a black van
Who am I boy? Lucifer in the flesh
Who are you? Just another pussy 'til death
Straight out the Seventh Ward
Me and $now Leopard trapping
All the limbs we hacking
From the fucking bodys stacking
The fucking crazy manic
When I'm in the cut don't panic

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 3: Ruby Da Cherry]
Bitch I be that ice cold yung white polar bear
Snatch your life so quick
Ha nah bitch I know you there
Focus on the glare hoes know that I dont care
But they dont know I dont give a fuck
Two bucks with the blunt
So I split it up
Time is my luck I can never get enough
I done fuck with drugs
Now I'm about to snatch blood
Leave you full of bugs
Leave you full of fucking slugs
See you on the cotton
When I'm filling up my mug
Gun tucked man you had to get plucked
Re-up, now I'm stuck fucking ducking out
Truck stay parked in the yard
I ain't going now
You a sitting duck because
Whenever I run out of drugs again
I'ma find you and put you in the trunk
Now your hoe getting fucked from the back
While I'm crumbling this weed
Tryna roll a fucking blunt
