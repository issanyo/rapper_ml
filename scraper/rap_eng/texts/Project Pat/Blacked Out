[Intro: Project Pat]
BLACKED OUT

[Chorus: Damas]
And a bumbaclot feel it real tough
Till they run up, Blacked out
Yea, now their tops off
And a bumbaclot feel them real tough
Till them run up, Blacked Out
Yea, now their tops off

[Bridge: Justin Hibbert [i]]
And i bet you put your hood on
Probably got that good huh?
Whole roster too strong
We've waited too long

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Blacked Out
Lights Out
Threw them chopper pipes out
Pull that barrel to your head
Squeeze the trigger
Lights out
Click Clack, last round
Bet your heard from behind
Split your shit like a melon
Now lets see whats on your mind
Bowl of kush, full of weed
Lungs full of ganja
No vest in your chest
Bullet holes they gonna puncture
Like a shark
I attack
Addicted to that black jack
If you fucking with my bread
Blow your chest up out your back
BANG BANG

[Bridge: Justin Hibbert [i]]
BLACKED OUT

[Verse 2: Justin Hibbert [i]]
All white girls
Thats crack rock
They don't stop
In they're tube tops
They don't ask why
But why not
New chest that daddy bought
Says it's timeless as she turns off the clock
Receives it in the slot
Keeps it wide
Only messed with football players till she met i
2 chainz on that no lie
One night then i'm out the door
So goodbye, goodbye e eye e eye
And we tipping to the tier
Bet it's what you fear
Way worse than you hear
In the crib bumping Kenny G
With a chick looking like Katy Perry
See, fresh back from Parii
She an Aries
Friday night women loving me
Let them come through
Pun intended it has to do with you
Every lie i say is true
If i tell it to you
The new black bond
What you see huh?
But like this business baby
You don't wanna come on too strong
Diablo songs
Cheech and Chong
Trevon hoodies on doing wrong
Oh

[Chorus: Damas]
And a bumbaclot feel it real tough
Till they run up, Blacked out
Yea, now their tops off
And a bumbaclot feel them real tough
Till them run up, Blacked Out
Yea, now their tops off

[Bridge: Justin Hibbert [i]]
And i bet you put your hood on
Probably got that good huh?
Whole roster too strong
We've waited too long

[Outro: Scary Voice]
Hahaha
Yes
It is i who decides who lives and who dies
All living things are mere play things to me
No one can comprehend my power or cunning
