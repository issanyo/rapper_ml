[Intro: La Chat]
Now what you really know about this gettin' money shit? Memphis, Ten, Young Dolph and I'm La Chat bitch. Feezy hit me up and said let's do the remix. I told him I got him cause I be gettin' money

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Fuck 'em once, fuck 'em twice
Fuck 'em good, fuck 'em right
I don't fuck with them niggas, mother fuck they life
I'm in Louie, Gucci, Saks like fuck the price
I be in there every night, only if the money right
Her pussy good, her stomach tight
I catch a nut then catch a flight
I ain't sorry
You play with my posse, I might catch a body
I'm out on my balcony, countin' cheese, smokin' broccoli
Tie your chick, she ain't wearin' panties, cookin' manicotti
Boss shit, you a petty bitch, you know nothin' bout it
Paper circulating like a ferris wheel but life ain't fair
The money call me, I pick up the phone and be like "I be there"

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
This Glock in my drawers hold me down like (?)
See your body Action News 5 slippin' in these streets
Money flippin' in these streets
Chopper grippin' on the heat
On paper blowin' loud, sippin' on (?) Street
20 on some Louie, 30 on my Rollie
These bitch diss me in high school actin' like they know me
Rich niggas, we don't trip, you just gotta blow me
Tennessee, not Missouri bitch, you gon' have to show me

[Verse 3: 8Ball]
Don't play young nigga, don't play
Keep that (?) shit up out your way
Hustle hard young nigga all day
Hard work and stayin' sucker free is how you get paid
Yeah, ain't nothin' free except trouble where I come from
Nigga you ain't hustlin' that mean you don't want none
Get up in the mornin' nigga like you tryna get some
Don't hang around niggas that don't wanna get none
Don't run behind bitches that don't wanna get none
You don't need the bitch if she always want somethin'
Remember this if you don't remember nothin' else
I say they scared of niggas with some money
Nigga get paid

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 4: La Chat]
All I know is that money, all I know is that cash
Big bank them pesos, blowin' on my good gas
Move in line, that Danny Green, that cheddar cheese, that fetti
Lead me to that paper trail, that chad bitch, go get it
Super high my shades on, fuck what ya heard, I'm gone
Whip clean, my grip beam, I'm shinin' on my own
I don't fuck with you haters, I'm too busy gettin' my paper
Don't you mention La Chat name unless your ass gon' pay up
Y'all hoes don't weigh up
Ball hard no lay up
Hood bitch got flavors
I'm dopin' on that A plus
Nice house on acres
Kushin' out my neighbors
Money long, my team strong, and I don't need no favors ho

[Hook: Young Dolph]
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Whatever you do, just make sure you get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid
Crib so big, that it came with a maid
Get paid, young nigga, get paid

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
First thing first I'm about my check
Get out of bed
Brush my teeth, hit the bank, bitch what's next
Oh I might be elevated
Elevated my money up
If yours ain't you can get the fuck from round me bruh
I've been making whip draws since the early 90's
Pull up in that skrrt, that's a Maserati
I'm floorin' in that foreign, that's where you can find me
In the club, money pourin' on the baddest hoes around me
Yeah ho
