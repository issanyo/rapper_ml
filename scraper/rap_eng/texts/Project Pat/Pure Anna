(Pure Anna for you hoes, Pure Anna for you hoes)
Where the hollow-point shells land, man nobody knows
(Pure Anna for you hoes, Pure Anna for you hoes)
Where the hollow-point shells land, man nobody knows

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
It seems like I might not even make it out here on these bricks
Might have to murder a trick, might have to kill a bitch
Maybe they gon' lock me up for dope ass lyrics that I spit
Like they did my nigga C-Bo, stressing gangsta shit
Look into the pit of my eyes, feel my anger
Seventeen rounds out the clip, through the chamber
I heard you cowards, mane, would love to see me and my niggas
Die a violent death from a gun, your hand on the trigger
Nigga you can do whatever the fuck you think you need
Snort you up some lines to build your heart, I'm gon' hit this weed
I procede, hoe, I'll die for mine, I'm ready to catch a caper
Most my niggas either on parole or some kinda paper
Fakers out here, mane, they hate real niggas with a passion
Project ain't yo' friend, motherfucker, label me assassin
Strictly blastin', casting', bitch; made niggas straight to hell
Fuck them laws, cause if I get caught, I ain't scared of jail

[Verse 2: Scan Man]
Please don't test these murderers
Buckshot slugs to your mug, ate your skin up with no love
It is I, the almighty Scan Man, from the Killa Klan
Insane in the brain, still throwin' bodies off the train
In the sky, mystic, black; time for a rib clench
On my victim because he tested, madness
And my tech 9 got me aimin' at your spine
My 357 blast and at the written right on time
They never find.. Your body parts, buried in my backyard
Daddy's hanging from a tree, granny has no fucking spleen
Mommy's in the garden, pregnant, fixin' up the soil
So I took my knife and ripped her fetus out so it was for
No more, her bustas' rip a rim around the chest
Now it's me, with the Anna that put you hoes to rest
But they call me crazy cause I said I ripped her fetus out her belly
It's not that I'm a psychotic, I'm just takin' cares of my business

[Verse 3: MC Mack]
Hopped off in my Toyo' with Carlo on chrome thangs
These bustas must back-up, and bitches must maintain
The Mack, I gotta express myself
And break it on down for these folks that don't hear me, though
Counterfeit smile, Mack-hater you ain't wild
Triple Six and Killa Klan got them thangs to your temple
Why these smoked up bitches all upset, is it cause it went state to state?
Getting calls from a broad that I fucked in the past
Still mad cause your name got exposed on tape
Murder, murder, R-izz-edrum, the outcome left a body numb
Putting it down for all the Macks, with a killer in-track with fire-arms
I see your jealous envy from them diamonds glistenin' around my neck
From trick to treat, we done played your bitch, smokin' green, stackin Gs
From morning-checks; purse first, ass last, you wanna know who's under the mask
Another dirty thug from the south, and I'm breaking backs
I'm chiefin' like an Indian, and the dust, that's the type of stage I'm in
Still blastin' with this yawk, come say hello to my little friend
From the streets of Memphis to the world, this clique done hit the top
The whop-bop straight from the Glock 'til your blood clots
MC Mack and I got..
