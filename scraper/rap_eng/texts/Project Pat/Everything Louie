[Hook: Juicy J] 2x
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is, everything is, everything is Louie

[Verse 1:]
I'm pulling Louie 13, Louie V to the floor
She says she love my Louie belt, then my pants at the floor
Louie shades, LV, duffle bag full of dough
Louie shoes, Louie bag, LV's on that hoe
Smokin California weed, nuthin' but kush in this bitch
Could play checkers on my belt, with the diamond print
Louie this, Louie that, I'm just so nigga rich
Look like my back hit a rodeo Louie V lick
She's a fashion whore, she'll suck a Louie V dick
My shades Louie, clothes Louie, hoe I'm dressed in this shit
My cars are all Louie like a boutique in this bitch
I got a scarf to match the boots
You think it's cold in this bitch, Louie!

[Hook: x2]
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is, everything is, everything is Louie

[Verse 2:]
I pull up in my foreign whip, bitches call me master
Louie scully, Louie scarf, icy like Alaska
Knock your bitch pussy out the park, Louie slugger
Everything Louie V down to the rubbers
Getting pussy while I'm flexin, Louie V covers
Poster for you haters, coaster swag see the muggers
Everything Louie, if you broke, don't put your hands on it
Louie V, Louie bag, bad bitches dance for it
Everything Louie bitch, closet is a fashion show
With a red carpet and I'm Louie V Castro
Louie atttitude, super star I'm an astro
Overseas just to get this here, where your passport?

[Hook: x2]
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is Louie, everything is Louie
Everything is, everything is, everything is Louie
