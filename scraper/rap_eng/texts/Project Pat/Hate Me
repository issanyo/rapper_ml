[Intro]
Bitch ass niggas
Niggas know they hatin' mane

[Hook]
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x5)
Stevie Wonder bread you can't see
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x2)

[Verse 1]
Flex on these niggas no body buildin'
Run a cheque up to the fuckin' ceilin'
Treat yo bitches like an oil rig
Killin' that pussy I'm still drillin'
Treat my hustle like I'm still dealin'
Murdered the trap bitch I made a killin'
Cold hearted on a hater's feelings
Jealous pussy nigga why?
I never hate I inspire
Bitch niggas with them salty ways
Got em waiting up like I'm servin' jays
Got 50 keys servin' 4 ways
50 K's flip em' 5 ways
20k less than 5 days
KK break a million [?]
Hundred band challenge in 30 days
Banana clip with their monkey ways
Two I done see a hater, I can't hear a hater
Third they killed a hater, popped him with a laser
Popped him in tha tater, R.I.P. a hater
Broken hate ain't add up
Talkin' like a bitch I'm [?] up
I done lost count, I got so many haters
I'm smoking bands while they catchin' vapours

[Hook]
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x5)
Stevie Wonder bread you can't see
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x2)

[Verse 2]
Niggas hate to see you come up on a lick
Niggas hate to see you come up on a brick
Ride around town, mane with the sticks
45 in my beam with a kit
Pulled up in the Ghost, we lit
Them haters don't like that shit
We gon' choose before they tellin' them lies
Always we stand up guys
Haters gon' hate but we still gettin' money
Showing these haters they salty bro
Spend my cheque like I'm baggin' up coke
Straight up out of trenches we baggin' up dough
Dog food money got 'em hatin'
Gas [?]
Runnin' up we ain't never waitin'
Run through it we a speed racer
Plenty paper got a breadmaker
Killin' this shit, undertaker
Haters wanna see me with the [?]
Kick doors down we a pull a K
Spare time but I'm off of that paper
Shout out to my mawfuckin' haters
No hustle, no job, got your pockets on [?]
My money Ray Charles you never will see

[Hook]
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x5)
Stevie Wonder bread you can't see
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x3)
'Cause a nigga like me you can't be
Bitch nigga yea I know you hate me (x2)
