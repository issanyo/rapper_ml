(Gucci Mane)
The Porsche porcelain, the rims is gorgeous
It erk when it skert it got so many horses
A ounce of what I smoke cost double your mortgage
So Icy Entertainment I'mma explain it
And when we come in niggas tuckin' they chain in
I lost my train of thought bitches calling me brainless
I can't buy a burger cause I'm too fucking famous
Change the whip on a donk, gave my Chevy a facelift
My 28' Asantis make it look like a spaceship
My rims look big like the lips of Fantasia
My paint drips wet like activator
You playing with yourself, you a masturbator
You play with So Icy, Ill have to spray ya
Dont waste all your life being a couch potato
After a while crocodile, see ya later hater
Its Gucci

(Chorus)
150 Ds got it smelling like weed
In the trap bustin bales down its time to eat
21 a key, 10 five a half a key, 55 a quarter key nigga come and see a G
Standin on the stove hard, working with them boulders
All these extra grams oughta bring me mo' cheese
Time to count that money man, man I need another hand
Bands after band, tell the fam it's time to eat

(Project Pat)
Theres money to be got, the crack is running low
I ain't got no purple plug, regular weed movin slow
Hidey Ho, like Robin Hood, robbin in another hood
A chopper barrel, shove it down ya throat and make it understood
Got 'em for a half a brick, eight pounds of purple
80 for the 7 grams, smokin on good purple
Jack fools, make ya strip down to ya butthole
Used to go to school with the fool, boy Im cutthroat
Get it how Im livin, by the gun bulletts spitto
AK 40 pumpin bullets like a sicko
I'm just a head crown, hold da jeans all white kicks
Watch 30 grand, like I slang all white bricks
North Memphis niggas when its good we do bad deals
Hittin forty blocks, all wop, thats how crack kills
Stacks will rise or somebody gotta pay the piper
I just want the stash dont you make me put you in a diaper (One of them Pampers nigga)

(Chorus 2x)
