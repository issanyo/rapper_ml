[Intro]
Look At My New Toybox, When I Wind It Up A Man Comes Out With A Mask And A Gun

[Hook x2]
Flashin', flashin' don't be with that flashin'
All these brand new cars and the club throwin' cashin'
Flashin', flashin' some niggas ain't havin'
Money in they face, they pull a gun then they grabbin'

[Verse 1]
I done trailed this nigga all day, find out where he he stay
Find out where he lay his head, where he keep that bread
I was bred to never talk always walk in silence
Rob you bare face, take your safe take what comes behind it
I got a pistol mane, hotter than the equator
Slammed across the boy head, he leaking like a radiator
Got him for 11 bowls, and a whole brick
My heart thumpin' real fast, about to make a swole lick
Had to get info out your broad, info out your dawg
You crashin' niggas walls, and let the moza rob you all
Gun going off, accidently for them giovanies
I'm car jackin' to, I'm just trying to get some money

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
All I need is a revolver, something that'll catch the shells
Ride upon this sucka, jump out bustin' bails
Nigga don't really wanna make Project Pat go AWOL
Come through your project with that, chopper mane and spray y'all
Bet you on them corners, you claim you be hanging out
(Gun Sounds) something like a sang along
Niggas get to frowning when they see Project in the club
Cause they know I'm snatching niggas chains and I get my mane
Anyway that I can get it, I'm a get it nigga, a quarter ounce to half-a-brick
The way we flip it nigga, screaming out I got it for the low
You know I'm lyin', met me with the drop, then rob them boys you know they cryin'

[Hook x2]
