[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
(La musica de Harry Fraud)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
You can't let the left nor the right hand man do it
Cause if they calculators move they may try to screw it
In the street anything goes, not just these hoes
Police stickin' dick in these snitches' booty holes
Crack dealin', money flippin', out here chasin' me a million
Stack my Fritos to the ceilin', tryna go old with my children
Fearin' nothin' but God, ho ass nigga ain't got no heart
Foreign ride, no key in, all I gotta do is push start
Revolver start spinnin' like a croc, only killin'
Project keep the street, keep the street, real-real billy
A hundred with this shit nigga, understand me
I'm walking bankroll you can rubber band me

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm off the top, I be wylin' for the thrill
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
I'm wreckin' havoc, I ain't even gotta kill
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm off the top, whole crowd catch a chill
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
I'm wreckin' havoc, I ain't even gotta kill

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
100 with the shit, nigga understand me
I'm killin' kids quicker than the fuckin' plan B
You might catch me somewhere loaded where it's hot and sandy
Or I'm up in Summer Slam with my nigga Randy
Yeah I'm fresh 100 feet, they ain't fuckin' with my streak
It ain't for everybody, give a shit if niggas sleep
Fuck it, bring the body bags
Hit him with that Gotti swag
Got no time to lolligag
All that hate, he probably mad
She playin' with that pussy, it's probably trash
Might hit it then curve your ass
Hold up, settle down, hit the herb and pass, I'm in it to win
Hit Sparkz on the line like we did it again

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm off the top, whole crowd catch a chill
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
I'm wreckin' havoc, I ain't even gotta kill

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the streets, graduated from housin'
Tendered 100s, I keep like 1000
Pull up in somethin' the trunk'll be poundin'
Wet up the block leavin' everything drownin'
Smell me, I'm talkin' like something is cookin'
And if you don't, why the fuck is you lookin'?
I am the ace, guarantee you mistook it
Gangster shit look like it's somewhere you book it
All I do is trap and cook white squares like it's a napkin
Thirty or better shit can happen
Show you bout money where you lackin'
I'm bout this chilla like a theorist
Still rep for the dirty like I'm Harry
This shit on lock, ain't shit to carry
Ain't worried bout niggas, niggas scary
Might just switch it up like I was MJ in the Jackson 5
Dance across the work and show you how to keep the trap alive
Pull up to wherever, have a team swarm you like a hive
I ain't gon' be more rehearsin', I'ma play my gangster live

[Hook: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm off the top, I be wylin' for the thrill
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
I'm wreckin' havoc, I ain't even gotta kill
I'm breaking legs, ribs, hundred dollar bills
I'm off the top, whole crowd catch a chill
I'm breaking arms, necks, hundred dollar bills
I'm wreckin' havoc, I ain't even gotta kill
