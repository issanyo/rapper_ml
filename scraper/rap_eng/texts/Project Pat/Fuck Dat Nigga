(Chorus)
Fuck dat nigga (x11)
Bang bang bang bang
Fuck dat shit

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Fuck that nigga and his whole damn neighborhood
Let me make one motherfuckin' thing understood
In my hood a couple of you niggas try to sell out, tell out
Now you gonna make me have to take my scope out
And when I do that I'mma aim then buck ya
Smilin' in my face, aww mane I'ma bust a
Cap in yo ass that's for fuckin' with me nigga
I know that you a hoe and now I heard you clamin' killa
A killa is a nigga who will look you in the eye
Put tha pistol in your face and let the pistol meet the fly
But I don't think so you better not try
I'm goin' out, hoe, like a kamikaze pilot
My eyelid raised and I got you in focus
Put you on a daze all you punk ass jokers
I hope this
Lesson motherfuckers gonna teach you
I got 6 slugs and they all wanna meet you

(Chorus) 2x
Fuck dat nigga
Fuck dat nigga
Fuck dat nigga
Bang bang bang
Fuck dat shit

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
Fuck you nigga and you know just who I'm talkin' bout
Livin' on that other side and you crossed a nigga out
I'm about my home when it comes to stayin' down
Use to be my road dog, now you just another clown
Hangin' 'round you was a very, very dumb mistake
Thought you was a real nigga but you was another fake
Busta, must a wanna be thugster
I'm a label you as a dead motherfucker
Fuckin with a nigga like Pat, you can die hoe
When I come out with the gat, I'ma try hoe
All of my might just to put you six under
Lookin' for a fight, I'mma break out with the thunder
Sound of a Glock 38 what you gonna do
Last sound that you hear *bang bang*
Mark ass niggas frontin' like they gonna blast
Don't make a nigga like me run and kill yo ass

(Chorus) 4x
Fuck dat nigga
Fuck dat nigga
Fuck dat nigga
Bang bang bang
Fuck dat shit
