[Intro]
Yeah nigga, yeah nigga (repeated)

[Hook: Proejct Pat]
I'm blowin' gas, ridin' makin' plays
I'm blowin' gas, ridin' makin' plays
I'm blowin' gas, ridin' makin' plays



[Verse 1: Project Pat]
Flippin' pack after packs
Sellin' wax, sellin' fracks
Out here squares here and there
Dawg like Jumping Jack
Plenty stacks, plenty bands
J smokin' cola gas
Smokin' on some shit have you higher than a marsian
Transformers, Megatronic stitchin' like a [?]
How can a fucking boss bow down like a [?]
Let it slide, let it live
Project ain't got shit to give
Bust some motherfucking bullets hope he don't stay with his kid
[?] stacks in my pocket on my cashin'
Steppin' down on all these niggas
So they can't make shit
Smilin' in my face, but I'm knowing that's that fake shit
Chopper like a moguls killing all that snake shit

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
[?] bout 7 pounds of midget
When I get it, it is gone on sell
Hustlin' motherfzcker
