[Hook: Project Pat]
I'm bout to pull a move, I'm bout to pull a move
I'm bout to pull a move, I'm bout to pull a move
Some bails here, some bricks there
Some pills here, some boy there
I'm bout to pull a move, I'm bout to pull a move
I'm bout to pull a move, I'm bout to pull a move
A stash here, some work there
Some powder here, some weed there

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I'm bout to ride on you niggas with that chopper thang
And like we auto man I'ma let that bitch sang
I never start shit my nigga, that I can not end
You out here flexin' that's why your dope got kidnapped
A real nigga bout his money gon' receive respect
And bullets comin' out them [?]
Like that Tec, back in the days, that I used to carry
[?] hustlin', gettin' brain, blowin' Mary
I do moves and I do flex
Been not going bout a [?]
Flossing in the nigga face
I jack hand on my stack
Plenty pills, plenty pounds everythang is for sale
Hand out to me to me you ain't my dawg, you can go to hell

[Hook: Project Pat]

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I got to down bitches out here [?]
They on they hustle like Project Pat do in the [future/feature?]
I'm out here on a mission
Dwag I'm in a good position
I feel you niggas tryin' to me me street intuition
Maybe superstition but I do not sleep on suckers
It's been shit get worse might have to kill some motherfuckers
Talkin' to nigga [?]
He was really scary
But a scary nigga put you in the cemetery
I'm a god at all times like a [swash butcher?]
My nigga I don't want your bitch I already fucked her
She already ate my dick like Capital Green
Put me on a lick over 30 thousand pills
