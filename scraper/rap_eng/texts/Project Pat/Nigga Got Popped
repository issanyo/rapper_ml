[Hook]
This nigga got popped, this nigga got drowned
This nigga got found on the other side of town
Wit' a whole lotta bullets in his head, in his head
Wit' a whole lotta bullets in his head, in his head
This nigga got popped, this nigga got drowned
This nigga got found on the other side of town
Wit' a whole lotta bullets in his head, in his head
Wit' a whole lotta bullets in his head, in his head

[Verse 1]
It was New Year's Eve, I was kickin' it wit' Gangsta
Fred, outta North Memphis on another ca-per
Fresh like the D mayne look like we on ki's
Eyes like a Chinese, we was on some trees
P's and our Q's, what us true's, niggas be's, on
Really from the hood, know a jackin' can happ-on
Ain't, no surprise when them pistols get to poppin' off
Ain't, no surprise when them choppers get to choppin' off
Could be alive once the drama get to hoppin' off
Whip ya up like cream then mayne, blow ya toppin' off
Made a left on Chelsea Ave, pulled in to Russell sto'
See my nigga Boo, conin', on his hustle flow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My nigga said, he got robbed, young skulls, pulled a jack
Say he had twelve rocks, and was low, on his cash
Had a case pendin', so that took, all his stash
Said he might, have to gon', pull, out the gun and mask
Ask "where I get the tools?" Eyes lookin' kinda shady
Smelled liquor on his breath, then he upped, a .380
Tone to my dome, life flashin', 'cross my eyeballs
Grabbed for the gun, right before he let a round off
Fred dropped the beer, of the nine comin' out the sto'
Shot him in the side, then the fool let the pistol go
Leakin' like a faucet he done ran off in the night
For this nigga's death, I was fiendin' like a hype

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's been seven days, we done caught up wit' the punk
In the very same spot, duct taped him in the trunk
In a Grand Marquis, stolen, rental car
Headed 55-South, then we exit on lamar
Sucker tried to resist, wanna squash it, nigga please
Me and Fred threw him in the trunk, bullets in his knees
I could squeeze, mercy in, but it's, principalities
Maybe mama can forgive but you did this to me
Mayne these streets, it can get, real wicked in the south
Nigga tried to take me out, now my .40's in his mouth
Blew the back, out his skull, where it dropped, where he lay
South memphis police found his body very next day
