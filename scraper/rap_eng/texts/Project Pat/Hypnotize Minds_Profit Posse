[Verse 1: Koopsta Knicca]​​​​
Get down, shut the fuck up, bitches don't make a sound
Body found on the ground, don't fuck with mentally rounds
I'm taking no bullshit from these trizicks So you best to avoid this
Cause I can afford to go back an order take the four door to help me kick this shit
Trizick don't forget foe I spit in your face
Putting this in they credit, man fuck them goddamn bitches

Put my hand on the wall, break it down y'all motherfucking
Law dealers and you know the Mafi face in the Posse y'all

[Verse​ 2: Crunchy Black]
Got my mug on my face
Ready to quickly erase
One of y'all haters done lost your taste
One of y'all niggas done lost your faith
Yes I hate when you hate
Yes I love when you love
But I'll put a hole in you
Leave you laying in a puddle of blood

[Verse 3: ​​​​​​MC Mack (of Killa Klan Kaze)]​​​​​​
Nigga look at all the shit that I done done
Look at all the shit that we been thru
Reminiscence on hoes that I have broke
And thinking of them loose things I would do
I be the MC Mack for life matter fact
Im standing on my own to stack
Them G's and making loot
Gotta flip them dollars
Sometimes we clone
Going on up come in our place y'all
We southern
Knowing that always brings you down
No matter how much I rap about haters
Need to just like me turns the frowns
I'm bound to break it on down
Like a quarter pound nigga
Take heed to the shit I speak
Killa Klan Kaze, Tear da Club up Thugs
We on the frequent trick to sleep Killa Klan

[Verse 4: Scan Man (of Killa Klan Kaze)]​​​​​
Criminal minded nigga, Kamikaze dwelling in my soul
Crazy is the Scan Man but you niggas just don't hear me though
Devil shit is what I do, man I just don't give a fuck
Trick us with that shitty mic you hoes can catch a fucking slug
Clickin' is the Scan Man I'm clickin' like a motherfucking murder man
Droppin' bitches in my stash when you hear that fucking nine blast
Easily this Posse creep cause we have no L-O-V
So we watch you burn in our pits

[Verse 5: ​Lord Infamous]
They always ask me "Do you worship the devil?"
And some of the times I think they see the horns on my head
Why must you even question what I believe in, silly mortal?
You test the third most powerful force in the galaxy
Shake ya dreads
Your very essence is burnt so you ask me do I worship that?
Bitch im Keyser Soze, I believe I hate you worse than that
Wish I could let every nuclear missile take an unknown course
Let the man with trumpets and the horns feel my evil force

[Verse 6: DJ Paul]
Look into the eyes of a mad man, shoot him in the head man
Loco on that cocoa plex, snort a ball and call the Killa Man
Shoot 'em now with slugs when I'm full of drugs
And I dare the bitch
Cock 'em up, load your Cutlass up, with your fucking click
Busting on you hoes sipping gatorade Hennessy
My entourage be straight from hypnotized Tennessee
Fuck with me, double casualty, turn to catastrophes
Your lacking these killers backing me up in my faculty

[Verse 7: Project Pat]​​​​​​​​
Its gangsta, its gangsta
Weak niggas perpetrating
Thug roles but really punk hoes
Staring at the snub nose
Barrel I say motherfuck those
Lames get you slugged hoes
When you slip bitch
Should have been on your ten toes
Watching out for the enemy
Violator don't say shit to me
Eyes tighter than a Chinese
From this Hennessy, murder me
If you get the first ups on your trigger (nigga)

[Verse 8: Juicy J]​
I stand by myself when it come to handling business
Them thangs on the shelf and that drank to keep me spinning
And would a nigga start, best believe the Juice gon finish
I feel like Jeffery Dahmer, chopping bodies in the kitchen
I walk around, I'm in a fucking daze like a killer
With a .357 to my head (squeeze the trigger nigga)
Not saying that I wanna kill myself on the for realer
Had eighty-two weeks and I'm looking like the thriller

[Outro: ​Prophet Posse]
Hypnotize C-A-M-P Posse
Hypnotize C-A-M-P Posse
Hypnotize C-A-M-P Posse
Hypnotize C-A-M-P Posse
