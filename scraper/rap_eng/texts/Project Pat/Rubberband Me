Rubberbands on my wrist cause it's stacks on deck
Robbers get a death wish, 40 cal to the neck
50 geeze on the wrist, I'm a get my respect
I heard you talkin with a lisp, wants to holla seat check
Goochie shoes on my feet, goochie looking just to cure
Ridin 30's on the hummer, 07 is the year
Smokin purple marijuana, sippin purp in the cup
Ghetto nigga with some money, buy the bar nigga what?
Ain't no slack in my mack, cause there's cheese to be gotten
All this candy on the chevy makes a haterz eyes run

Girl flaggin me down an egyptian lookin broad

Peanut butter recuss, with an orange paint job
Strip a club flash money like I bought a bank job
Diamonds flyin from the bezzle see the rolex watch
Desert E runnin chambers so a nigga can't rob

Itbezzle jeans white tee mane that nigga clean girl
We trapped with the cane came from Texas the valley
Smokin good bubble cush call me straight outta Cali
Chain got so much ice mane you can call me frosty
They shine like my 24's you can call me flossin
For checkin size guns got me hositle
You ain't Tom Cruise cause your mission is impossible
