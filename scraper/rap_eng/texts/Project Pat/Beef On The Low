[Intro]
Mann nigga know it's beef on the low bro
My dude know I don't fuck with them niggas
I don't know why he bring them niggas over here like that
Mann, go get them mother fucking pistols
Nigga think i'm playing
Nigga know he don't pull beef over here

[Hook]
It's beef on the low
I don't fuck with bro

[Verse 1]
It's beef on the low
40 like a pit on a leash
I let it go
It's beef on the low
You suckas got me bent
Cutting deals on the work before you it's the strength
Don't bring them niggas around me
It's beef on the low
Acting like it's good
But them bitches know
Russian gunnas for you stunna robbing ducks for their pesos
Real niggas get their casos
While you suckas chase hoes
Try to flex a nigga
Own a couple of b's
Know good and well that was some bad bitch weed
Who the fuck you flexing
It's beef on the low
Caught you sleepin in my hood at the corner store
Loaded up the 44 then let it unload
This bitch got shot in the back of the head
It's beef on the low
Ain't nobody innocent when they around your way
Choppas bullets choose to hit em
That's their ass

[Hook]
It's beef on the low
I don't fuck with bro
I don't fuck with him
I don't mess with them
That slick shit
It's beef on the low
Get you hit shit
It's beef on the low
It's beef on the low
I don't fuck with bro
I don't fuck with him
I don't mess with them
That slick shit
It's beef on the low
Get you hit shit

[Verse 2]
It's beef on the low
Mother fuck police
I'm the judge
And I'm having coke in these streets
It's beef on the low
This shit been simmering
I ain't from Florida but I'd killer a nigga like Zimmerman
Catch you in the hood nigga ain't no passes
Like I didn't see the move pull like I need glasses
Don't you hate when mother fuckers
Show your intelligence
Like when a nigga bring that pack
And he done dipped in the sacked
These niggas shoulda known better than to play the god
Them bullets coming for you
You need to pray to god
You lil bitches actresses
Yall playing hard
These bullets cut your ass in half like a deck of cards

[Hook]
It's beef on the low
I don't fuck with bro

I don't mess with them
That slick shit
It's beef on the low
Get you hit shit
It's beef on the low
It's beef on the low

Get you hit shit
