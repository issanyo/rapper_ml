Nigga takin` like they stutin`
But real niggas ain't stupid
Who you think you foolin`
Who you think you foolin`



Dees niggas frontin
They fugazy
They so fake
They green ass hell
Dog you faw
Yous a lair
Keep it g you broke ass hell
I was breaking down demm bails
So much work
We broke the scale
You ain't bout that life boy
Yous a scared to go to jail
Real niggas no the truth dog
You soft , timed , frail
Try to run like you a boss and
Ain't got no money for your bail
Police put dat pressure on you
And you know you gonna tell
You ain't never seen a bird
You ain't never made a sale
You the type that work in the louie store
Lookin` for a sell
You can lie to these bitches
Keep it real wit yo self
Ain't no reffs in this game
Find your ass on the injured list
Talkin` what you can't aford
Nigga den get on da geuss list

Nigga

Hook

Real nigga gon huslte
Get of dey ass and go n get it
Fuck boys just talk about it
Wanna face for hoes in dey city
A real nigga gon do a world wide
Get up big like diddy
Some off ya got constipated huslte
Everything about you shitty
Nigga talkin` like dey stuntin`
But real niggas ain't stupid
Who you think you foolin`
Money tall stack like ewing
Stack tall everyday i ball
What the fuck you think im doin`
Worry bout your money
And not my dick
And who the fuck he screwin`
That flexxin` shit get you kidnaped
And you ain't worth $1
Double barrel to yo momma head
My nigga do you follow
We ain't playin round wit that bull shit
Nigga stop all that frontin`
Like a pastor in the bullpit
Before you leave you give me somethin`
