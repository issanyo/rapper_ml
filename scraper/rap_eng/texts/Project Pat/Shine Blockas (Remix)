[Intro: Big Boi] + (Gucci Mane)
Yeah! All the ladies say hoooo
All the hoes say, (Hah, Hah, Hah)
Yeah! Here we go A-town! C-post!
Cutmaster Swift, down your throat
Boy stop!!!!

[Verse One: Bun B]
Hot damn, ho (ho), here we go again (gain)
Raise up off of mines, put your elbow in
Slow your roll like your off-sets is off set
You out of line, cuz you out off line, so you off net
Leather seats all wet, paint up on the Fleetwood
On this point, Jordans on my toes, did my feet good
Still got my Coogi, my shorty got a Gucci on
Flossing on the same track I hear Big and Gucci on
Now we remixed it like it's two different packs
Of Kool-Aid in the same jug, and I'm feeling same, thug
This is for the boys in blue, and the G's flamed up
I'm in the big body slab, raised up, game up!

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Hold up, hold up guess who just showed up?
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
I'm on my grind shawty, don't block my shine shawty
Wait a minute, wait a minute, chill a little, sit a minute
I can't close my safe no more cause I got too much money in it

[Project Pat over Hook]
It's your boy....
Project Pattah

[Verse Two: Project Pat]
I still get if off with the soft and the hard
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Used to dodge them laws in them stolen cars
Now I'm Escalade, sitting high with the stars
Took a shine like a star, now my head is in the clouds
And I'm papered, so I'm right back on the line
Project Pat, my dog, and I'm leading half a pound
Cousin house in the bay, on the North side of town
Man, the streets in me, so I can't say I don't miss em
Dipping through the hood plucking chicks, but I don't kiss em
She wishin that I would take her home; long stick her
Then I get her back, hit it from the back and I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Big Boi]
Can't be tripping bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe
The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can get up and walk away, shawty
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac
From Atlanta to Savannah, can a nigga stop that?
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
And the weak minded are falling by the wayside
They try But which I overcome and succeed, indeed
But with success comes a great responsibility
We chose to lead not follow, It's a hard pill to swallow
Better get prescriptions filled cause there might not be tomorrow

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Boi] + (Gucci Mane)
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
A-Town representer (Hold-hold-hold up)
East Point, College Park
Decatur, Yeah!
I got me armor on, sword and shield on deck
