[Hook]
Put your hands on that wall
Bounce it like a ball (x2)
Shawty bounce it like a ball
I'ma throw it all
Bounce it like a ball (x2)
Shawty bounce it like a ball
Bounce it like a ball
Shawty bounce it like a ball
Bounce it like a ball
Shawty bounce it like a ball
Bounce it like a ball
Shawty bounce it like a ball
Bounce it like a ball
Shawty bounce it like a ball

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
She a sexy lil something, her booty super swole
I ain't never seen a monkey with a camel toe
Bend on over baby, pick that money off the floor
Jump back on the pole, and I might throw some more
We gon' pour some more
We gon' smoke some more
Throw your hands on that wall and twerk that ass some more
Bounce that booty up and down make it sweep the floor
And if I head for the door she gon' go
Soft chewing gum tongue get your ass in trouble
Have your girl wanna kill, Ms Hubble Bubble
With the thick legs, country like the Waltons
I get up on that ass like a spalding

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
My name Nasty Mane, I'm a nasty mothafucka
I'll eat your pussy good, If you let me fuck ya
I'll fuck your sister, your auntie, and mother
Baby please don't pussy hate, see your only supper
Now my dick in her like a basket at a Rutger
Money licks to the click lollipop Sucker
Matter of fact, she love to suck me no I'm not a sucker
Daddy drop her good, she wet like butter
Going in hard like a play after a huddle
Only chasing paper, ain't got time to cuddle
Suck her titties, smack her ass, she rubbing on my muscle
Bumping Gucci Mane, like a dog while I hump her
Take her to the bedroom, jacuzzi with the bubble
Real kinky freaky blind folded cuff her
She like it when I smack her booty like she in trouble
She bounce it like a ball, so I had to slam dunk her
