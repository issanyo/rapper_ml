[Hook: Project Pat]
We chiefin' like a engine hey ya ya ya
Smokin' like a engine hey ya ya ya
(Repeat 4x)

[Verse 1: Project Pat]
I'm so high I'm facing fears, That's high as fuck
This weed so good gotta close your ears, that's loud as fuck
Rollin up that westcoast, papers, cigars, bongs, weed pipes
Real niggas smoke it all
You know I fuck with them vapors, smoke weed under the table
Smoking pounds back to back, this drink got me faded
I can't see a damn thang out these gucci aviators
Got my lean on ice, looking for some kush later
Break that shit on down roll up another blunt
Bitch I burn up 'til I turn up, then I do my own stunts
Got my white girl sending me a new strand of weed
Lean in my cup I go ham, movin' slower than an old man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Young Khalifa man and I'm a play-yi-yi-ya
Rollin' up that reefer everyday-yi-yi-ya
Try me you gon see that I don't play-yi-yi-ya
No shirt on he loading up that Kay-yi-yi-ya
Talking shit we find out where he stay-yi-yi-ya
Hit'em up with something make him say-yi-yi-ya
Chopper bullets hit him in face ay-yi-yi-ya
Talibana way my niggas spray BOW-BOW-BOW
Run up on you, what you niggas sayin' nigga right now
Heard you got that kush but it ain't right it's that light brown
You niggas in the way-yi-yi-ya
Only when my bitch do what I say-yi-yi-ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Project Pat]
Hey-yi-yi-ya
Smokin' on that fi-yi-yi-ya
Turnt up on that white liquor vodka
Smoking on this green like a rasta
I got the wax candles lit, like a crucifix
This a true lesson to be inhalin' some Cali shit
Red hairs mixed with purple hairs, this that Kool-Aid kush
A 4 poured up, mixed with some orange Crush
We on some astronaut shit, bout to lift off
My partner puttin' on this, he at work he pissed off
Them bitches on they way, dawg my dick like crowbar
I hope they got the shoes on, Im'a knock they shoes off
