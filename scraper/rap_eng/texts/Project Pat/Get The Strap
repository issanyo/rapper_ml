[Intro:Nick-B]
Nick-B
Grindhard

[Chorus:Nick-B]
Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Praying I won't make it, fuck it dust it off
You ain’t pushing nothing, I can't fuck with you at all
It's nothing, took some loses but I know I never fall

Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Hit the city with me, yeah you know I’m tryna ball
You ain't pushing nothing but you said you have it all
It's nothing took some loses but I know I never fall

[Verse 1:Nick-B]
For them bands I'ma get it you like a bitch on her menstrual
Ya mental fold under pressure you acting too sentimental
Coincidentally you ratted extendo clips for these snitches
My situation is building the vision mixed with ambition
Them suckas ain't pushing nothin, they 10 below poverty
To many bitches be fucking and giving head for da free
Gotta steer clear of you lame ducks you a puppet to me
I'm trying to cut the strings, you dead, them hollows peel thru ya knees
I know you creepin tryna take what's mine, I'll turn this bitch to Columbine
Go improvise and stay wit da nines, we terrorize them dolla signs
Now why you thinking suicide when bottom line I die for mine
Stop clinging onto death them shooters caught you by the dotted line
Go move to the back, I guess you ain’t tryna stunt
Vultures say that you love me, but I ain’t seen em in months
I'm on my way to the top, so tell ya plug I don’t front
Keep on hating on me that 45 is a must

[Chorus:Nick-B]
Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Praying I won't make it, fuck it dust it off
You ain't pushing nothing, I can't fuck with you at all
It’s nothing, took some loses but I know I never fall

Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Hit the city with me, yeah you know I'm tryna ball
You ain't pushing nothing but you said you have it all
It's nothing took some loses but I know I never fall

[Verse 2'Project Pat]
30 bands, 30 grand, AK-40 in my hand
Make you suckers understand
Draco kill ya where you stand
Sold a nigga a key of sand
Thought that I was his man
A project nigga, get it out the mud, got it out the pan
I'll be damned if I'm not gonna count up alotta grands
In my city for that peanut butter make a lotta jam
50 in the drum make you scram
Call me Uncle Sam, the way I tax these niggas
I don't play I send them killas
Pattaa
Still the same nigga hanging with the hittas
Have my shooter bring you extra guns
I can squeeze the trigger
Extra figures, foot off the side for them extra nigga
See them bullets poppin
You either dead or on a stretcher nigga

[Chorus:Nick-B]
Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Praying I won't make it, fuck it dust it off
You ain't pushing nothing, I can't fuck with you at all
It's nothing, took some loses but I know I never fall

Drippin yeah ya boy just got the sauce
Hit the city with me, yeah you know I'm tryna ball
You ain't pushing nothing but you said you have it all
It's nothing took some loses but I know I never fall
