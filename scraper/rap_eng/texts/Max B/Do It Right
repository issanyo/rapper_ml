[French Montana:]
Hold on to ya love

French Montana:
If you wanna do it, take your time
Do it right
You can do it baby
Get yo' money right

[Verse 1 Max B:]
After two fifths of Cru, I had the plan made
Nigga got his food ate, patched it up wit' a band-aid
Max mayonaisse, macaroni cheese, and mustard
Your bitches look busted
Shit got me disgusted, clusters droop off the left wrist
I think I got a death wish
Sittin' back, suicide your thoughts of doin' it
Hittin' the switch, all my niggas could move a brick
I can move the shit on a slow day, no play, okay
I be speakin' to my bitch Oshay
And as we roll on, hold on to ya love
Mami fiendin', she want more drugs
Shaking and she goin' through withdrawls
Big pitfalls, I'm 'bout to be the shit dog
Can a nigga stop what I'm bringin', singin'
Soundin' all good
I'm going all around the hood, it's Max B

[Hook]

[Verse 2 French Montana:]
Get high till we can't see
Your rap career over, look for plan B
These rap niggas, softer than cotton candy
I ain't a boss, all my niggas family
Every nigga near me, got a gun just as big as Camby
That's Marcus, and open coffins
Bootleg cable, and bitch
You get what you bring to the table
I got shrimp and spaghetti, and Prego sauce
Yeah my boy polished, homie ding those off
And I hear him knockin', it's the Wavie Crockett
With more hoes from River Road
And more O's, and plenty rolled
From food stamps to big checks
And I'll smack a bitch wit' a 100 stacks off a reflex
That's a jackpot, 650 with the ragtop
And Pillsbury for a mascot

[Hook]

[Verse 3 Tony Yayo:]
S.O.D. Swammies On Deck homie
My killers O.D. and die for respect homie
The barrel of my gun, start to pre-cum
Fiendin' to buss, I'm low when the D's come
G-Unit is a money-makin' fountain
25 on the wrist, my chick in Christian LaBoutan's
Kick a nigga in the head, football punt a nigga
Then stab a nigga quick like a London nigga
Your career is a blender nigga, mine is promised
I wear a 9 in the snakeskin Pradas
Wit' a 9 in a chick that's chasin' dollars
Like I'm chasin' dollars
By any means necessary, yeah a nigga necklace heavy
Let the caviar dreams star out
I'm in the hood with the Porsche out
To the G5 turbulation
The fly dude by it, where they camel-racin'

[Hook]
