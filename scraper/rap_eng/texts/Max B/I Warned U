[Hook: French Montana]
I warned you
The right way
I warned you
Now look what you made me do
I want you to know
Nigga I done warned you

[Verse 1: Max B]
Motherfucker tried to get me real good with my back turned
Nigga used to stop 'til I put him on the back burn
Now it's Max's turn, gas burn
Bullets come in [?] than your man
Me and Gucci at it again
Shoot 'em in the [?]
Tryna keep me, thought I wasn't on point
Nigga ain't shit but I'm just humble as old boy
Bigga on the shit, you better put a stop to him
Somebody tried to shoot him
Nigga tried to stop my flow, cause your bitch was in love
Mini man, baby just [?] off any man
You can hit anything once
All you gotta do is keep it 100 with the bitch
Tell her I'm the shit
I can hit 30 bitches while I'm smoking the spliff
Whites, see you nigga tonighty-night
Caught him in his car, he was losing
Snoozing, falling asleep
I can blow it all in a week, out

[Hook: French Montana]
I warned you
The right way
I warned you
Now look what you made me do
I want you to know
Nigga I done warned you

[Verse 2: French Montana]
A little [?], it get me in the mood
Homie I ain't try to lose my cool
Ask wavy crack, easy mac
Shawty ass softer than Similac
Beat it up then send her back
If she won't go, you never know
She in the loop, I'm in the coupe
No top in the wintertime
Mink on, hoodie on
That's how I'm feeling
Drop ceiling
Round tape, King R, the top dealer
Homie it's a lot of shit that I ain't feelin'
But can't speak on it, let 'em sleep on it
My pants low, floss my ass off
My hands shake, dump the cash off
It's a whole different kind of music
They don't do it how we do it
Coke Wave

[Hook: French Montana]
I warned you
The right way
I warned you
Now look what you made me do
I want you to know
Nigga I done warned you
