I don't really know what you been told
I don't know whats got into these hoes
But I think I do got 'em tight eyed from the stank I blew
Got em tight why from the bank i too like my oh my
What you think i should do
Can't call the girl
Max fuck around might spoil your world
Max fuck around might call your girl
She'll pick up, I'll say hi, we'll just fuck in my nice big ride
She'll get stuck from the nice spliff I
Like Chrisp I Ace of Spades
Touch my man hit your face with a blade (with the blade)
Hit your face with the K
PoPo can get raped in the raid
No no then get raped in the game
Let guns go off, get streets in a frenzy
Max ain't broke Max B got a Benzy
Max ain't off Max swift like kenzie

Hold me, hug me, I'm alone
Kiss me, dismiss me, time to go
Gotta go, gotta go gotta go, gotta go
Hold tight, all night, i get home
Nigga that your wave can't get with me
Make you shake ya ass bitch skip to the beat
Out of control

Started out with the piff in the ride
Light that wave put the piff in the sky
What you think about him
Knuck if you buck
Climb on top and fuck till you bust
I'ma fuck with you but I be on my shit
Everyday life I be on the limb
Stick to the wave
Bullets in ya gut make you stick to the pain
Stick to the grave I can pick with your brain
Cherry red 4 door 6 in the lane
Aye, niggas wanna pass me when I go slow
Bitches say I'm nasty when I go low
Betta duck motherfucker before you get hit
I take a motherfucker before it get bent
Light that weed, I like that weed
I only smoke Sour D not that seed

Hold me, hug me, I'm alone
Kiss me, dismiss me, time to go
Gotta go, gotta go gotta go gotta go
Hold tight, alright, i get home
Niggas that you with can't get with me
Make you shake ya ass bitch skip to the beat
Out of control
