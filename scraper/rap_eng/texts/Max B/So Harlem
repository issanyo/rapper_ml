Free bail posters, tail lights on the roadster (Ferraris)
Live life vulgar, the FBI posters (fuck the feds)
The fast cars pack guns no holsters (fully loaded)
We act dumb don't approach us (watch yourself)
We hit the spot & stand on club sofas (ballin)
So get the club owners (where he at)
Cause we the boss type knicks game court side
Big chain sporty ride

And courts in session so you all could rise (stand up)
Then pay homage to the board that lies
