[Hook]
I started on my own and I had to survive
A couple women texting I never reply
I knew that I would get it was never surprised
My father used to say keep your eye on the prize
My homie used to say keep your eye on the stove
And now they see us getting it all over the globe
I remember nights when we ran in them homes
I swear we thought the police was tapping our phones
Yeah I used to sip out the styrofoam
Now I'm just a pimp with a thousand hoes

[Verse 1]
Thousand of them
Please forgive me
I'm out in LA it get faker than some titties
But I need a girl to love me for the real me
She got a body like Billie, Jean
Picture her body in the sauna, steam
Like a virgin, my Madonna, clean
We make a movie it's a drama, scene
I told myself no more sipping lean
Lil baby told me that she missing me
These niggas hating they can't sit with me
I pity the fool like I'm Mr. T
Fuck up a cheque and I'm gone, shawty gon' strip in the thong
I'm trying to get on, I had to right so many wrongs
Used to live in the Bronx now I'm in the crib with the lawn
Rocking that Ralph Lauren
I am, I am

[Hook]
I started on my own and I had to survive
A couple women texting I never reply
I knew that I would get it was never surprised
My father used to say keep your eye on the prize
My homie used to say keep your eye on the stove
And now they see us getting it all over the globe
I remember nights when we ran in them homes
I swear we thought the police was tapping our phones
Yeah I used to sip out the styrofoam
Now I'm just a pimp with a thousand hoes

[Verse 2]
I had to get the dough without needing the loan
The road was always rocky, Sylvester Stallone
Now a nigga popping I'm doing these shows
I'm 'bout to put my niggas all in some diamonds fo sho
Me and all my niggas just do it for fun
I always knew that I was the chosen one
Some niggas came to my crib with a loaded gun
The night we made it out our lives were good

[Hook]
I started on my own and I had to survive
A couple women texting I never reply
I knew that I would get it was never surprised
My father used to say keep your eye on the prize
My homie used to say keep your eye on the stove
And now they see us getting it all over the globe
I remember nights when we ran in them homes
I swear we thought the police was tapping our phones
Yeah I used to sip out the styrofoam
Now I'm just a pimp with a thousand hoes
