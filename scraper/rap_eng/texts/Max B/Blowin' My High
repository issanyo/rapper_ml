(Hook)

I say what I mean, and I do what I say
That Grand Cru got me high
I'm faded but it's not enough
The fact is I need to smoke

(Verse One)

Now when im chillin and sittin up in the club that be leisure
Throw up a sign and keep it movin is the procedure
I ain't tryna talk about a feature
I ain't tryna hear how niggas came runnin from the bleachers
Im tryna holla at kadija
Her top game had a nigga shakin like he was catchin a seizure
Jesus had a nigga on kick back
Had to (?) just to give me my dick back
Hair not done but its slicked back
The don on chill
Max b the young ron o'neal
How you actin like the God won't peel
Guard ya chest plate, gassed dude to throw the beer in Ron Artest's face
Chicks know I'm able to hit
Word is I ain't a sucka for love I just think wit my dick
I think its a gift (?)
Smokin up all the sour diesel and drinkin a fif
Chill dawg im tryna get in my groove
Puff a little haze and get up in the mood
But cha all in my ears im checkin for the hoes
All in my eyes mutha fucka u blowin my high
Cut me a little slack give me a little air
Heres a 10 heres a 20 go get you a little beer
Matter a fact go get cha a little slide mutha fucka u blowin my high

(Hook)

I say what I mean, and I do what I say
That Grand Cru got me high
I'm faded but it's not enough
The fact is I need to smoke

(verse two)

Friends came along chicks came along
Eager for the dick game
Big tings a gwan big cane to cook big dope to cut
Shoot threw ya door as soon as I open up
Dame roll the haze up we ain't smoke enough
Bezzy all brick all frozen and stuff
Chump act like he all chosen and stuff
Pop at ya forehead nose in ya gut
Im low in the cut
I know a few hoes that will shoot threw customs wit o's in they butt
But is this nigga really holdin or what
Cause he talk, floss like he put o and them up
Hit ya foes and nem up
24 inch rims strobes in the truck
Ducky and demitri im over dem sluts
Bullets in ya stomach real hot
Feel like u got a stove in a gut
Chill dawg im tryna get in my groove
Puff a little haze and get up in the mood
But cha all in my ears im checkin for the hoes
All in my eyes mutha fucka u blowin my high
Cut me a little slack give me a little air
Heres a 10 heres a 20 go get you a little beer
Matter a fact go get cha a little slide mutha fucka u blowin my high

(Hook)

I say what I mean, and I do what I say
That Grand Cru got me high

The fact is I need to smoke

(verse three)

Gain green boss im cuttin out the middle men

(Hook)
