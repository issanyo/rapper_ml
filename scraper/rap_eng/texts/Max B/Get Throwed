[Verse]
Let the nigga put it in, give Belly the word
Take it back, 9-6, December the third
That was back when the coop was high, like twenty a bird
And we never spend money for furs
Get money to [?], do at the mall
Biggavel always in the loot with the stars
Bubblegum look type doing the job
Bitches on strip get nude in the bars
She dating the fan, the Coupe is a car
Champagne bottles on the roof of the bar
Sip a [?], wishing that L was here
Only do Brown or Belvedere
No jails [?], no scales are there
Keep shit clean, no paraphernalia
No contraband, no shells in there
Spit like salt 'cause it smells in there
It's the boy with the flow
Thirteen in them [?]
Chirping in them [?]
Squirt trees in them, you already know
It's Biggavel, baby
Bullets so hot, made a nigga yell, baby
Pulling [?], make a nigga ill, baby
Get out with the Glock, [?] Biggavel, baby

[Hook]
Oww, oww, oww, oww, oww, oww
Make a nigga feel hood, make a nigga feel good
Can't nobody up and do what we do
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
All my niggas get bread, all my niggas get head
Can't nobody up and do what we do
Oww, oww, oww, oww, oww, oww
Make a nigga feel hood, make a nigga feel good
Can't nobody up and do what we do
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
All my niggas get bread, all my niggas get head
Can't nobody up and do what we do
