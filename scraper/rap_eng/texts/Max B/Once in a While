It's your boy Max Biggavel
We wavy, wavy baby, on the wave
Why I always do that?
Cause I had this over over my head so I said
I figured you know if I gotta go trial, i'll just go trial
At least I know a nigga out there holdin' it down
You know what I'm sayin
We was a part of something together my nigga
He killin' it, number one
Like he real wavy right now, and I always knew it's no secret
Get the Coke Wave, listen to it
Keep the jams on radio, Macaroni and Cheese
Like, I'm tellin' 'em
I already knew what was gonna go down, you feel me
It's nothing

No evil in you is the guest that shall prosper me
Who God bless, no man curse

And they say

It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for, ain’t it?
What people payin paper for?

It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for
It’s what ya all been waitin for, ain’t it?

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder

Getting shot up, then he got up
Came back then he lit the spot up
Homie hit the chart up
Moroccan boy, you sloppy boy
3 chains on, I be Rocky boy
Packs out the lobby boy
Nigga you can read on, each dream on
French, got my feet on
With money I can lean on
Canary chain cold but still keep the heat on
Your bitch with the raccoon vest, Peter Pete on
Catch me at the game, hard wood where my feet on
Lookin for an actress on my wood I could skeet on
Mansion on the other hand, live from the mother land
2 straps on, east side where you rumbling

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line

Alfred Hitchcock, two fist fight
Caught a nigga slippin for his chain and his wrist watch
Murder was the case that they gave me
I can’t believe my boo bout to have my baby
Uh, you out of luck, mercedes truck
Pull up, distance, shoot better
Ducking from the knocks, Elz near Crotona park
Out of control, now a nigga go control him up
Shoot outs and move out, ask to break last
9th floor seats, talkin to the bench players
Tell the mic baby, it’s my city
Lead the game, hit green house, me and Diddy

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
My money on the line
Murder was the case that they gave me

Murder, cold blooded murder
Cold blooded murder
