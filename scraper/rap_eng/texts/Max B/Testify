NOE:
Whattup people
This is NOE, Baltimore Beast man
Dipset, Byrdgang
Jim Jones, waddup, Max B, Jha, waddup
It's not a game man
I feel like man, I had to, I had to vent over this track man
It's outta necessity, ya know
It's outta necessity
How vain it is to sit down and write
When a lotta y'all muthafuckas ain't stood up to live
Listen

Verse 1
NOE:
When the wind blows, it carries my struggle
And all the pain that I bear
There's a consequence of learning to smuggle
For learning how to bag it up and piss out clean pee
To bag a quarter key of dope and piss out green tea
I learned it in a cell when I spent a couple years, piss clear
You couldn't even tell when I went
Man I welcome all the hell that I see
Zeus fucks with me, it's like I declare celibacy
I prefer my offense cuz it's more fun to run it and score
But I'm reminded what the guns is for
And I'm reminded what the purpose of hard-slumming was for
To publish and leave y'all lames runnin' for sure
But I prefer to crash when niggas hurt for cash
When they cut small slabs for the hard white to last
Tell everybody that
An argument with me usually ends with cops screaming "Everybody back"
So don't cross my line
For months I ain't toss up the 9
Not sayin' that it don't cross my mind
Last time i checked I ain't have a good beat on what's right from wrong
Or what's life from song
You see the way I'm slaying New York
And I done went to war here to earn a major pay in New York
So of course I draw quicker, I'm sicker than most
So when I sneeze it's to I pick up the toast
It's y'all blessing, I deep-earth 'em
I make 'em a deep person
He paid wit' his life, I hope the lord rebirth him
A long way from jinglin' change
And I'm eons away from a transcript and singlin' names
In the strip club singlin' dames
Here's a 100, hang around, cuz I too hate to mingle with lames
See, life is just a spender in time
So when I get behind the mic I see the world
Pretend that it's mine

Hook
NOE:
Will you testify for half of the street
Or join in on a bloodbath in the street
Survive my nigga
If you wanna get up
Better get with the Byrdgang
(Repeat)

Verse 2
Max B:
I can pipe, right? I can type, right?
Mines is real, nigga what ya life like
I come in ya spot with the ice bright
Splurge in hotspots, score on dyke night
Spurrin the droptop, all if the price right
Some like Max, some wanna be like Mike
Some like stacks, some wanna be type light
Head crack the nigga's ass up, he like dice
We can cop but we still take ices
Big nigga, big figures, 6 digit, base prices
We all through your globe again
All through your hoes again
Verse 2, same shit, through ya hoes again
This shit is just like smack up your nose again
The world is kinda small, can't you feel the shit closing in
Max will put a bullet hole through your clothes again
Or shoot at ya foes, it's all for the dough again

Hook

Verse 3
Jim Jones:
Streets ain't the same (Naw, it's different)
My ear to the pavement
But I think I hear the streets saying names
So as a G I'm ashamed
But I just put the racks with the skis on the Range
And I dropped 50 stacks to put the piece on the chain
See I jumped knee-deep in the game
Cuz I don't need it like (naw, mu'fucka)
Cuz I don't wanna fry (nope)
Byrdgang, big Coupes is what we wanna ride
G5s, big planes is what we wanna fly
All that plus honor our pride
Without that fuck it, well fuck it, you rather die
So all my life I just wanted a chance
But I'm still running around with the gun in my pants
The vest on daily
Why you eatin Chow, up in the mess all fairly
I try to tell the game that it's best y'all kill me
Momma told me slow up cuz the stress gon' kill me
Cuz they ain't loving you
Naw, they just loving the bad guy
They don't give a fuck, they just wanting the crack high
But we don't give a fuck, we just want the dough to stack high
To the ceiling, oh what a feeling
Tryna get cake like George from Beantown
Head outta state is how I seen town
You wouldn't believe the cake I see now
