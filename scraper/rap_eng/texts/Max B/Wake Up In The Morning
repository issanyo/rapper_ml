[Intro]
[French Montana Talking & Hook 1]
Uh

Hahaha
Look what the fuck we did man
We let Ya Niggas rock
Ya Know gave ya niggas the radio
Gave ya niggas satellite (When that four fif pop and you bleed you don't hear no noise)
All that crazy shit

It so happened we the hottest thing going on(You won't wake up in the morning)

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Cross the ts dot The is
Whip a hundred gs drop the top
Drive through the ps cop the pies
Look for a skeezer I can find
Heat in the stash lock and load
Press that button lock the door
I know they wanna do me got my safety off my tooly
Fuck niggas tried to screw and keep fucking with my head
Feeling like do these niggas and just walk out with that bread
That street shit dented in my soul
Left the bitch wet
Drop step put it in her hole
Got the licks and the reefer smoke
You don't need a boat
That coke wave potent music take you where you need to go
Its like a Key of snow
Argentina with my bitch have you seen her
I'm tryna beat beat beat beat like Valentino
Father please bless my enemies for them not knowing
Shot me in the head I shook it off
Nigga Kept on going
Dead man got a voice
Getting head in a Royce
London boy said that nigga moist
Coke Wave

[Hook 2]
[Max B]
Dollar bill and coca
I'm a everyday smoker
Love a bitch that's mocha
On the sofa
Still sound like to me like we got that wave
Oh not dour im a get you flowers
Time to get more money more hoes
Still sound like to me like we got that wave

[Verse 2: Max B]
Niggas buzzes turned out light
Fuck these bitches get there swagger from
She fucked me now he mad at her

BB belt and a fly moncler
Yeah know a nigga gots to keep that ratchet up
Coke on the table bagging it up
Capping it up
Nigga im clean
Picture me rolling on rims 16
Picture me fall off with these flows
Dick many hoes on the pimpy mode
M3 note that's that new
Hat to the back in that black new coupe
Catch you duke
Man im made
About to touch a mill goddamn I'm paid
Maid come and clean my shit
Stressed like I always need me a bitch
Need me a dip
This ain't right
Nigga got to get that tight
Get that flight easy mac
Boss biggavel where you need me at?
Where are these birds?
Fuck you max what are these words?
