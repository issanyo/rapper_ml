(Verse One- Max B)
First Chris let me get her necklace

'Cuz we had a long night and I can't leave till I get my song right
All right
Got to get this one shorty she a freak got to get me some
It's three chicks got to get me one
I'mnot a nigga to leave that 10

(Hook)
Take me out to breakfast
Let me floss your teeth
Give me your direction
Make me scream your name
You'll be making it rain
I'll be making it pour
You'll be my American Slore

(Verse Two- Max B)
Bitches at the club was feasting
So come out with stars they eating
Once we was at the Hilton
So I think I just chill for the weekend
Nigga Bigavelle be cheating
Mama ask me whats popping
So I gave her my t-shirt
And told her to rock it
With lots of confidence
Bend the bitch over donkey
I like it when she call me donkey
So I gave the bitch two hundred
And told the ho not to never to call me
Give me your direction
Me and my home

(Hook)
Take me out to breakfast
Let me floss your teeth
Give me your direction
Make me scream your name
You'll be making it rain
I'll be making it pour
You'll be my American Slore
American Whore (x2)


(Verse Three- Al Pac)
Shes at the jump off Ready to jump off
And when I squirt in her face she lick the cum off
Mama real freaky plus she like it rough
When I give her back shots she can't get enough
I'm goin all night and she fucking good
These hoes love a nigga even though I'm no good
They all wanna taste, they all wanna lick
Your mom beasting hoes fighting for this dick
Got these hoes open, note the thug passion
Take it to the spot lets get it cracking
Got to beat it up I leave the pussy soft
Man fuck a bitch I never love a whore
I get 'em for the bread, break up papi always
Fuck the small talk Ma nigga want his phone
We can get it on
Make 'em scream my name
Ask around 'bout the kid Ma I do my thing

(Hook)
Take me out to breakfast
Let me floss your teeth
Give me your direction
Make me scream your name
You'll be making it rain
I'll be making it pour
You'll be my American Slore
American whore (x2)
