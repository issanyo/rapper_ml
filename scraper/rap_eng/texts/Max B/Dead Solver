Little nigga showing off try to past me the ratchet
Got the hummer toy pimp slapping the shit out of a bitch

Got the dick hard slipped it in to her
Get ya pension up old nigga
You can diss anybody but

Talk about running in her mouth with the lama
Fuck her with no condom

Put ya shit on the gate like a nigga on the packer
5th grip is spiting at any nigga that act up
Get your chest to you back up

Pts calling for back up my niggas back up
Yeah we be tearing this trap up to get this trap up
Punchlines hit like a Mack truck that nigga mad tough
Waiting here for me for Joe, you gonna hold ya breath
Ripping at these flows till death
Till it ain't flow is left
Some niggas don't notice yet
Hold the mic like a tech
Spiting to the coldest met
Bounce like a loaded jet
Still niggas gonna hold the set
All them Thugs in your basement
Screaming like a bitch when those slugs penetrating
There's a reason niggas hating
And her more to add to the list
It's a dash to the bricks
Don't be last to this shit make them
Shit on his niggas straight spaz on his bitch
If you weren't you niggas bumping trash on the strip

[Verse 3 - Max B]
Big machine, big recoil
Whenever it spit, Biggie give your a detour
Meatball ass bitch, classic Max kick
I'm not your average, this rap shit is a marriage
Know how mad I get, every time I hear this faggot
Lip sing more, still he fucking the same whore
After she (what she do?)
Sucked my dick and then pulled off the beanie yo
Wiped her skin clean with ya speedo
We got the Orbit, got the Efferdent, breathmints
Bitch smoke cigs, all this shit is irrelevant
Let's talk about, how you niggas is girly
Kissing and making up
Bigga, you're breaking up
You niggas is fake enough
Knowing I'm, thousand time better with the flows
I'm the favorite, single weak, hated it
Copped the bootleg then I traded it
Get off me man
Used the shit to hold the coffee stand
Ow


[Hook]
Take a look at my life they wanna know

Follow follow me take a journey with the boy
Oh boy I see Bigga he brought another toy
I think ya daddy needs new shoes
