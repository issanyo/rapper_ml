[Intro: Max B]
We got this thing
Call her
Goon Music 1.5: Doomship
Fire it up
French Montana
What's good bitch?
Ferg
Talk

[Verse 1: Max B]
I got these niggas
Beggin' me to stop
Beggin' me to not
They better me up to box
But I bounce back, kept it grungey
Wavy for the bitches in my lap
Got you niggas under wrap, like scrungey(?)
Little dude, big dick, never was hunky, nigga
Boy from the jungle, but never was a monkey (aah)
Stay in my lane
Spray at your brain
They wanted me out the game
But I hit 'em hard with the Trilogy
The Domain Collector's Edition
Stopped 'em from reaching this epitome
I'm a keep comin' with the good shit
Keep you nigga caught up in the lifestyle
I could put your lights out
I can get ya, nice house
Baby don't rush to take it, take a chill
I'm wavy with the whip appeal
Quick to kill
Any bitch nigga that say things
Sit your $5 ass down before I make change

[Hook: Max B]
Was it me?
Was it them?
Was it them?
Tell me what happened
I can't call it, officer, I wasn't there
Was it you?
Was it me?
Was it him?
Scattered a bunch of snow way up in the air
It's the Coke Wave, life isn't fair

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(French!)
Wrist a hundred thou
Whip a hundred thou
My niggas hunt you down
Your bitch wipe me down
This I do it easy
Take two of these
Body the track, then I'm gonna loop the beat
I'm on fire
I'll shoot you on sight
Move work all day, count money all night
I go cop low tops, hundred pairs
If walls had ears, I'd do a hundred years
They throw darts
I throw back bullets
Close range shots, Kodak footage
I'm an astronaut, fuck a star
Homie, you don't really want what you askin' for
I play for keeps
Aston Mar with tornado(?) seats
Goon Musik with Dame Grease
Now Max and [?], Max and choppers
You need wires, tubes, mats and doctors

[Hook: Max B]
Was it me?
Was it them?
Was it them?
Tell me what happened
I can't call it, officer, I wasn't there
Was it you?
Was it me?
Was it him?
Scattered a bunch of snow way up in the air
It's the Coke Wave, life isn't fair

[Verse 3: Hollywood Fergie]
700 for the kush, that's what Frenchy charge
I sip the Grand Cru, with dreams of fuckin' Remy Ma
I'm in the process of pickin' up where Pun left off
Let's have a contest
See how quick your gun let off
Come to my strip
You can see how quick I get that pist-ol
My form like [?]
Get your face ripped off
Gain Greene, you now rockin' with the renegades
East Coast warlords, and y'all niggas been afraid
Fire up the doomship
Grease, I'm ready to do this
Grease sittin' on damn near a hundred bricks of the smoothest
City of Cocaine, Public Domain
Used to be a no name, till I flipped the whole thing
Now we outta state, Miami every winter
I can't remember the last time I seen a snow flake
Bought a blue 650 with no deal
Y'all stick to the basics
I'm the glitch in the Matrix

[Hook: Max B]
Was it me?
Was it them?
Was it them?
Tell me what happened
I can't call it, officer, I wasn't there
Was it you?
Was it me?
Was it him?
Scattered a bunch of snow way up in the air
It's the Coke Wave, life isn't fair
