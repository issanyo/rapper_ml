[Intro: Max B]
Max B, you see?
There's a lot of speculation, right
(Henny the Don: I'm G'd up!)
Twenty million in the boil of hell
B2, come on! Gang Green, getting room
(Henny the Don: Nigga, I'm G'd up!)
Now we're in the studio chillin'
(Henny the Don: I'm G'd up!)

[Verse 1: Henny the Don]
Your mommy see me leaning in the beemer
Floating of the top rope they tell me dreamer
Feeling a type comfortable, hitting these chicks
With big dicks, what we love to do you
That money, when it comes to this money
Bullets from the semi-auto running up to your tummy
I'm G'd up, tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuck
I'm a professional pimp, don't stress a ho, bitch
Get you for your whole shit
I'mma get this nigga whole clips, I was in the Benz babe
I've seen poody room, I was in your crib, kid
I know where you live bitch, I'm better off
Chevy Carrera Porsche and leather cloth
It's very short, tie you up, don't shot the bullet wound
Cut you up for the cheddar cause, aw

[Hook: Henny the Don]
How many a rider, always on the grind
I'm cocking my nine, whenever it's time for crime
I'm G'd up, it's all a nigga know
I'm G'd up, getting a lot of dough
I'm Gang Green, we hold it steady rolling
Pockets is heavy and all swollen, nigga, I'm G'd up
Tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuzz

[Verse 2: Henny the Don]
Don't get it confused, we can get it on
But I'm always playing it cool, and niggas know I'm a rider
Cause before the singing and rapping I was cooking them pipes up
I get it popping, I don't play no games, I'm G'd up
I'm saying no names, I'm G'd up, I slain that cane
I rep that thing and plus I bang bang

[Verse 3: Max B]
Yo, I resemble it, seven-forty-feezy
Niggas like Max how you do it so easy
Max, how you do it so freely
Chick touch, might as well join us
You niggas can't be us
Fifty on the side wearing my sneaker
Whitey, don't know if you noticed
I don't think he likes me
Tell me when he see me, come and fight me
He don't wanna do that
Ship him of to Mikey, he don't wanna move that

[Bridge: Henny the Don]
If you hustling in the streets
You all in your heat
Trying to stay low for the D's
They G'd up, stay G'd up
Throw it up if you're riding that 5
And you're busting your guns
Trying to keep your niggas alive
They G'd up, stay G'd up

[Hook 2x]
I'm Gang Green, we hold it steady rolling
Pockets is heavy and all swollen, nigga, I'm G'd up
Tie me a nigga up, mommy eat up
And now I'm trying to fuzz
How many a rider, always on the grind
I'm cocking my nine, whenever it's time for crime
I'm G'd up, it's all a nigga know
I'm G'd up, getting a lot of dough

[Outro: Max B]
Biggest B's, B2B Entertainment
Gang Green, Harlem Matriarch
We stick together baby, it's Harlem!
We back, okay... 2 G's
