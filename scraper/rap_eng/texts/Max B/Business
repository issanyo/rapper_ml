[Intro: Max B]
I usually don't share these, but Imma put my boy on this one

Sing that shit, baby

[Hook: Max B]
Baby, I'm just tryna handle my business
Business

We did it once, we gonna do it again

[Verse 1: Max B]
See I get at a nigga, like it's nothin ?
Won't you just cut them niggas some slack, tippin in the trap
Me and French, on the bentch, ?

Won't you get a nigga outa here?
Baby mama thought I don't care?
She be stressin me, elling me ?
Cause mama never rased a quitter
Make them bitches work just to get the dick
Baby you so talented, if you ever in trouble, the law will get you out of it
I ain't tryna ?
I ain't give my cousin the keys, I was ?
Wavey for the first time, all these bitch wanna be
Finally I see the light

[Hook: Max B]
Baby, I'm just tryna handle my business
Business

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Max, what up?
Got feds on a nigga back, shauty steddy winding, we don't spend time, heavy in the trap
Right around the corner with them boys holding burners
Held the burner in the bush, then they put them cuffs on me
Fuck, watchin Mama looking through the shades
See her boy in handcuffs, she said "stop movin that tan stuff, man up"
Fuck a pack, movin weight, get my bands up
Get drops at the gate, for a paper for a plate
Linked up with my buddy Max, called it Coke Wave
All day no tax, he dead off wax
Nigga need new pussy, bounce with the older
All they respect is bounce and the dollar
Only tryna to do to ballance out the moola
Now we got the streets saying "there's nothing you can do"
Don't come close, to that homie Young Loce
Max, watch that money back
Montana
