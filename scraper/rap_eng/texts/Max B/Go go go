Check it out, check it out out

Check it out, check it out out
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
The one that use tell me which way did she go. the other way 
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
The one that use tell me which way did she go. the other way

But a nigga ...never say loud
