[Hook]
She told me I just wanna be your lady, lady
You own the key to my heart and soul, oh
It's just your spirit drives my crazy, crazy
You're the only bitch in my life, you're my baby baby
Baby, baby

[Verse 1:]
I'm looked at him dead in his eye
Made him tell me what it cost
The vision is clear
Give me Perellis on the Porsche
Never seen a nigga so mean
Come home and get it rocking for niggas
Just repping the streets
My crew will get it popping
My bitches, they treat me like a king
I like to keep them on balance like they was there to swing
Well what's your name
I am the million dollar king
Spent a fair been in my life in and out the clink
But um, now I'm back on my grind paper-chasing
M.O.B. did it in stores, all the niggas waiting
I told her she good up in the hood
You better to getting bitch while it's good


[Hook]
She told me I just wanna be your lady, lady
You own the key to my heart and soul, oh
It's just your spirit drives my crazy, crazy
You're the only bitch in my life, you're my baby baby
Baby, baby


[Verse 2:]
Gave her the benefit of doubt
Tried to get out
Tried to spit it in her mouth
Leaned back, took me a puff, sitting on the chest
Called her a B, she said Biggaveli, you's a mess
She ain't never worried about a nigga getting weak
She hit the bleep, me and chinchilla in the jeep
Riding low, hat to the back, finger in her ear
Sipping slow, Yak in the Ac, thinking I'm in here
Yeah, just call up a night for Biggavell
More clientele, more bubbly and bigger tele's
Told his baby-moms I'm stressing for what they did to Blaze
Got my baby darling peressing, we puffing on some haze
She don't smoke, but she took a hit
Took a flick, pulled up her dress, then she took again
Yeah
My bitches, I learned a lot of wrong
Get them stoned, get them home
And make them give me dome
Ow


[Hook]
She told me I just wanna be your lady, lady
You own the key to my heart and soul, oh
It's just your spirit drives my crazy, crazy
You're the only bitch in my life, you're my baby baby
Baby, baby
