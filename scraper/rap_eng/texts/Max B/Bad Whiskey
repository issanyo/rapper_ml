[Intro]

Domain pain for you niggas
Let's go
Get at your man


[Verse 1]
I got the forty low
Covered up like I'm forty below
Seven in like I'm forty to go
Or maybe more

I'm the Waviest of all
I got a black one white one
Even keep a slim bitch
They all stick together
And they got a good friendship
Closet so expensive
Angel mon, Cold haan
And if I'm smoking that haze
That's forty of that oho bond

Loop ya

Your music need a booster
The fifth will leave you screaming like a rooster
Sweep the nigga body of the stoop like a Supra
Nigga I'm the future
Nigga I be used to, the finer shit
I don't do that herb you
I only do designer shit
I only do the Gucci, Louie, Fendi, Prada
Biggavell is a pimp
I run up in ya mama
I run up with the lama
Pop it at any nigga thinking he is thug
Don't pull up
I'm a fill this nigga with slugs
I seen this nigga in a club out in Jersey
Seen his team looking like they want to hurt me
But thanks to the frontline
You only gotta tell them focus up one time
Nigga, I be trying to duck the one time
You smoking with thirty niggas on one dime


[Hook]

On the stroll of the strip like
Bitches on the dick like
Big pipe
Cherry lip gloss get your lips right
Get your lips wet

Nigga I'm Green Gain
Rollie in the mean chain
I leave you holly in the cheese lane
Holly molly go fuck yourself
Plea your chain
For the better Max do it for your boy
You was riding in the Jetta Max
Do it for a toy
I be moving like I'm Floyd
Right jab left jab
93 was the shit
Harlem had the best cabs
Aj Lester's the best rags
A buck 20 then
That was big money yeah
And that's was a 20-10
I was getting money when Reagan was in office
Peepee on your carpet
Grind like an orphan
Lime in the coffin
Bitches of the Myspace
Love me out in Boston
