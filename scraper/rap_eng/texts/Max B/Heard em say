Chorus:
When i was young, dumb and full of cum
I ain't need no company, When i be late comin
From the streets, i be needin u to come for me
I need you to fuck with me, cause im tryna fuck with you
Fuck with you, but i got other bitches too

Verse 1:
My baby she tell dont leave, she dont want me to go
She tell me im mean, tell me my heart is colder than snow
Say im livin on the edge, like i was on a rope
Walk in and tell her say a prayer im about to go
Dear lord, [im comin for shows need to renew
Who are these niggas that tell me " i dont believe
You can too"]
Use to hit on the cell ain’t need no bitches after
Maybe beat off in the tel, member we was in jail
Can't be runnin back and forth in the bubble gettin mail
Got me contemplating my seed while im on my route
Take another puff of the Deez times running out
Baby this a dirty game it'll tear a nigga up
On the rode with beautiful bitches, yeah a nigga fuck
But these bitches dont get a dime, they dont get the time that you get
When i ain’t out runnin in the lime
Oww

Chorus:
When i was young, dumb and full of cum
I ain't need no company
When i late comin from the streets, i be needin you to come for me
I need you to fuck with me, cause im tryna fuck with you
Fuck with you
But i got other bitches too
