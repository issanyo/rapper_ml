(Intro: Max B) Yea Boss Don, got the boy J.Y. a club banger, gotta let em know we was in the studio together making that wave, gotta do this for gang green you know get real wavy, let's go, Boss Don

(Hook: Max B) We make it rain on these hoes, we don't throw dollars we pour bottles
Mami be in the club like I swallow, give me your number and I'll holla, got shorty in the club like Ow, Ow
Bigga and J.Y. style, style
A little bit louder now, baby I get paid for my shows

(Verse: J.Y.) I'm sipping on pimpin', parking lot pimpin', bumpin' max b mothafucka
Ridin' like a g mothafucka
Long live the wave mothafucka
First shoutout Future, listen to the future, got a brown bitch that wanna learn the karma sutra
Comin' to the right place, I can be the tutor
Nigga blowin smoke up her ass but hookah (fuck with me)
Save the funny shit like a blooper
Got two bitches in the crib, mr cooper
Guess who back up in the building like the super
Don't spill no drink on this mink bitch this fuisha (WOOOSAH)
On instagram she the horniest
A bitch with 100 likes be the loneliest
I show her what a ginuine pony is
Bitch don't worry how long it is, lean

(Pre hook: J.Y.) I got a table full of dub sacks
Fake nigga never was that
Lenny leanin on them hoes bitch I does that
So a nigga style heard she loves that/
I got a 40 on my hip tho
I ain't got pounds I got zips tho
And my city bitch I run that
So a nigga style heard she love that/

Verse: J.Y.) She got a man had to fall back
(Psyche) you know the slimes always crawl back
Ever since I was a small cat
I just had my word and my ball sack/
Yall into whips I ain't off that
Im into pimpin bitches yea im off that
I got ya sister on the strip too
But aunt jemama, bring in short stacks/
Boss shit bitches love that
Need an ounce for 220 where the plug at
I took a 5th to the face I just chugged back
Im just goin off wheel like a hubcap/

I got a 40 on my hip tho
I ain't got pounds I got zips tho
And my city bitch I run that
So a nigga style heard she loves that, Lean

(Hook: Max B) We make it rain on these hoes, we don't throw dollars we pour bottles
Mami be in the club like I swallow, give me your number and I'll holla, got shorty in the club like Ow, Ow
Bigga and J.Y. style, style
A little bit louder now, baby I get paid for my shows
