[Chorus:]
I got a 50 of some piffy and the sour linger in my soul
(Sour linger in my clothes)
I was riding in the bucket and was riding in the droptop Rove
I'm still up to whippin' now and then
We got the power, Sylar poppin' on the stove
(It's poppin' on the stove)
And I'm blowin' a dub, duu-uub, dub

[Verse 1:]
Contemplatin' 'bout my trip to the Bahamas
As I spin through my condo in my Calvin Klein pajamas
Like, I peep the spliff, but if baby-moms
Blowin' on some shit probably bigger than my baby arm
Pissed the lady off so she comes to me for comfort
Picture baby-moms, now she comes to me for cum squirts
Gun work, got it if the nigga buzzed, pop it at a nigga mug
Watch the Bigga ride, I'm tryna see this nigga die, right
I ain't givin' no mercy
Baby need shoes and my niggas is thirsty
Ladies want a nigga back in, fuckin' fat bitch
I keep the extra Mac 10
You can find me in the trap, on the AM
Pump is in the store right next to the Jamaican
I'm a shake him, break him, take him to the basket
Ya momma picked the suit while they lay you in ya casket
Owww

[Chorus:]
I got a 50 of some piffy and the sour linger in my soul
(Sour linger in my clothes)
I was riding in the bucket and was riding in the droptop Rove
I'm still up to whippin' now and then
We got the power, Sylar poppin' on the stove
(It's poppin' on the stove)
And I'm blowin' a dub, duu-uub, dub

[Verse 2:]
Now just when you thought it might have seemed enough
Momma in the room screaming beat me up
My brothers used to beat me up
Meet me up top where they hella pop
Nigga you climb, I'm a meet you in my helicop'
I will never stop till the day I die
Even then they'll praise me as the great one
They rate me at an even 10
Seen the man in suttin' real wavy in the drive-thru
You can hide nigga I'm a find you, must I remind you
Don't a nigga style come close to the Wave Man
Nigga I'm a made-man, caveman
Had to do my 8 in the state pen
That's an old chapter in my life like The Great Danz
Pacin' back and forth thinkin' 'bout will he ever do the time
Can he go to jail, if he didn't will he do the crime
Poppa in the staircase doin' lines
Got his energy all up, nigga we ball up
Like that, Owww

[Chorus:]
I got a 50 of some piffy and the sour linger in my soul
(Sour linger in my clothes)
I was riding in the bucket and was riding in the droptop Rove
I'm still up to whippin' now and then
We got the power, Sylar poppin' on the stove
(It's poppin' on the stove)
And I'm blowin' a dub, duu-uub, dub

[Verse 3:]
They tryna push a nigga outta the way, hey
They tryna black-ball a nigga, tryna take a nigga outta the game, hey
And since I left, they ain't rappin' the same, hey
Fuck around with' Biggavel you might not be rappin' again, hey
Baby, baby, baby
I'll make my money, set my cake up
Only got 23 days and then wake up
Pull the.40 out and get to smearin' ya make-up
Tear ya face up, bullets shoot from the waist up
Fuck, killed my brother, he was 17
Put it in his head, the voices, they will never leave
He watchin' over, he be tellin' me
"Max, take ya time, don't rush" if bitches hit me with the pussy, I'm a fuck it
Owww

[Chorus:]
I got a 50 of some piffy and the sour linger in my soul
(Sour linger in my clothes)
I was riding in the bucket and was riding in the droptop Rove
I'm still up to whippin' now and then
We got the power, Sylar poppin' on the stove
(It's poppin' on the stove)
And I'm blowin' a dub, duu-uub, dub
