[Intro]
Come here baby, come sit on my lap
Lemme whisper some fly shit in yo ear
Yeah, fuck with ya boy
She said, "I want you Bigga" (Al Pac)
Yeahï»¿ (Mustard)
These niggas did 16000 the first week, so fuckin' disgusting (let's go)

[Verse]
(Yeah) I'm here now, you old news
Lucky niggas up yo' ass, you got horseshoes
(More cars) More jewels, Bigga see he's no best
If his Bentley come in bulletproof he really don't need no vest
Got that water, call me Poland Spring
Money that's my sorta thing
I can't believe you not standing with that quarter key, go with me
Let me take you places, I got bitches in the stations gettin' cake
And they all been waiting just so patient
Waiting to fuck this dick like a rodeo
Pimpin' like I'm Romeo
Send yo soul to where no man can boldly go, owe me dough
Niggas best to pay me 'fore I lift him with this .80 off his feet
Got these niggas thinking that they wavy, that was not the case
Let me break it down
Put it up, I'm going take it down
Had to scrape it down, bag them 20's right
Got that money looking nice
We getting it in the slums
She said "I don't like his dick, only Bigga make me cum"
Oww
