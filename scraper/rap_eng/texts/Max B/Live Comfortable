(Hook)
You have to battle if you want my heart
I can't have none of that, tell em what to say Max
Say, no go
Nigga tryna live comfortable
Nigga tryna smoke blunts with you
Tryna go to the movie
Can a nigga make love to you
Nigga tryna live comfortable
Nigga tryna smoke blunts with you
Tryna go to the movies
Can a nigga make love to you

[Verse 1:]
PD3, I'm a do it again, over there with me and Peezly
Baby know you wanna come and tease me
Hit it from the back of the beamer
Roll up another piece, mommy she a steamer
Put your lips on it, shorty wanna bone me, freaky
Pour it in a cup like pee-pee, Kiki
That's my bitch, but she sneaky, good for a couple of ones
Know I got a couple of guns
Come and roll with' a nigga, bitch, that'll take you places
Everywhere I go, same faces
This bitch, that bitch, big dick, fat dick, put it up in ya butt
Got her like "Nigga, what? "
Got em in the cut, I can doubleback, that's my shit
Had a nigga like, "That's my bitch"
Damn Biggaveli, I was in love
But since it was you, fuck it nigga do what you want
Uh, fuck it

[Hook:]
You have to battle if you want my hoes
I can't have none of that, tell em what to say Max
Say, no go
Nigga tryna live comfortable
Nigga tryna smoke blunts with you
Tryna go to the movie
Can a nigga make love to you
Nigga tryna live comfortable
Nigga tryna smoke blunts with' you
Tryna go to the movie
Can a nigga make love to you

[Verse 2:]
We was on 33rd, I was chillin with Smoove
Had a lotta piff in the air, I was feelin the groove
Seen a lil young bitch, nice lil hips, I was ready
Told me that she wanna go steady
Ready, fuck her on the first day, want you in the worst way
Shorty tried to put it on me
Lonely, Maxi, baby, wavy
Pour it in me more like Katie
Hit it on the strip like "Oww, Oww"
Pretty bitches is wild, they be lovin my style
Money, got it in pounds
Baby won't you come and perform
She be tremblin, shakin, I can make her cum in her drawers
I can hit it from the back, smack it till it's red
I'm a sit it on my lap, she back up in the bed
I'm a get em, hit em with the head like I filled em with lead
Bitch, go get my muthafuckin bread
Ya
