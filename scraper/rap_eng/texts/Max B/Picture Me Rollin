[Intro]

(I walk the streets alone) It's a privilege
(I walk the streets alone)
Something  you can't do baby
That's another topic, let's give it to 'em

[Verse 1:]
Them niggas need to hit me with my grip
I want it now, I'm a ride on these bitches till I get it
I'm coming down to the studio. We know where you be, you can hide, but you can't run
Get that bitch from me, here her man come
Jealous like a little green monster
These bitches just flashing money, Maxi I really want ya
I just wanna start a lilâ€™ family-
Bitch, what you talking 'bout, your daddy think I'm a pimp and your mama can't stand me
Candy, brought her on her birthday
Fuck is the PD3? Niggas is getting thirsty
Lip Sing, dammit that's my joint Max, when you tryna put it out?
She said my dick is the best, so when you tryna pull it out?
All my niggas hoodied out, hooded up
Now whisper it in her ear, then tell me if it's good enough
Shorty coulda fronted but she didn't man, pump and steady pitching man
Got me ducking the fuzz, somebody's gonna get ya man, damn

[Chorus]
Just let me live my life with you
(Just let me live my life with you)
I can cook, clean, and cater and be nice to you, oooooh
Lil nigga you just mad I won't write with you
Owww
You ain't never seen a nigga prolific like the Bigga so let go
Owww
Picture me rollin

[Verse 2:]
I be speaking to my brother
He told me keep the pressure on these niggas, never trust 'em
They test you, motherfuck 'em
Nigga Gida getting big, smoked and stroll, he said "Biggavel...
Watch them niggas you with", then he lit up a L
Gotta give 'em that, Bigga manning up, nigga bounced back
Gain Greene, bottle of the Cru, blow a ounce back
See the boy finally on his shit, he so handsome
Momma she in love with her grandson
Love his chubby cheeks and his nice skin
Looking like his daddy back in '80 when he was just a baby
Maybe, one day he can be a star, just like his poppa was
Only fucks with the sour, that's how I get a proper buzz
Lemme tell you how I was, wild lil' nigga in the streets
Nigga don't sleep, running from the police
O.G. told me, step on niggas, had to get to the top
Nigga we non-stop, nigga we gon' pop

[Chorus]

Picture me rollin' baby
Boss Don Biggavel, oh man
Shout out my boy, Young Los, on the beat
Musical genius, yeah
It's Gain Greene baby
Domain Pain, art of lip singing
So wavy, gotta love it, Oww
