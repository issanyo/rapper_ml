[Verse 1 - Max B]
Riding in the cruise lane doing like 35
If I blow trial im doing like 35
Im dirty ride pockets is pearly ride
Fuck ya bitches talking bout, biggavelli certified
Hit ya witch that trip and ties touch that to the left
Watch you panicking to friendsie, hop up in that benzie
Wacth these niggas envy, those so ain't my yang
Make that paper on the daily, bitches fuck you really
Nigga im the boss man don turn ya cops black
Frauds shake that nigga clap the  back boy
Might've seen me stunting  in the couppe for real all my niggas shoot to kill
Since  Im the one who  took the blue pill
Went to see the aura gucci, told me max nigga dont you change
Fuck these bitches stay the same make em watch you pimp the game
And, dont come back, till you took it all up
Had to floosh it all up, I done fucked it all up

[hook]
Got them fifties and kush, got them cases all cleared
I got bitches i fuck em everyday in the week
Call the clique tho we probably everyday that we meet
City to city we sold coke
A nigga hot up off that bud pocket full of money
Bitches told me scrub it, not over my tummy/tommy
Pop over its nothing now all of the sudden
We living in the city with no hoes

[verse2]
I got these niggas weak, leaning against the rolls
Tryna stay alive put that pressure on that coke
Time to make it rise,  we stretching it
Charlie gets the best of it, choko gets his 20 cent
Chico get the rest of it, look what ima invest in it
Dabble coke and E' pill workers taking fees
Spray the scrobus fuck the d's
They gon have ya in the benz, doing detail scenery
12, and I didn't check the retail  sceet
Shells got you bitches walking on, bare foot
Fucking up your heels, biggaveli got the sex appeal
That the bitches love give him gut strokes
Make music for the club folks
Gun dope, fiend sniff
Listen to this mean shit
