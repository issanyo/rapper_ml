Had the bags all over the floor pits ate 'em up
High off the residue we tried to wake him up
Time to scrape em up
I trick six on a off day hit the block for a hour then I can make it up
My bitches cook and clean cause my hooks is mean
Young boss pimp, I'm a hooker's dream
I took the Beam for a spin
Pray to the lord, get on my knees if I see 'em
Spray at ya fort, get off my kneez then I grin
Who popped ya, you niggas live life of imposters
I'm on your roof with a chopper
It's like taking candy from a baby, all the food in ya locker
