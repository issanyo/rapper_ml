You already know

Shit, fuck it

Anyone who got a nigga locked up, this one's for y'all

[Hook]
You see here in this game there is no understanding
Where do I go (check it out, check it out, oww)
I ride through Jersey, look for answers to my questions
Where do I go (check it out, check it out, oww)
I find some chick I know that loves to give me head
Where do I go (check it out, check it out, oww)
I got that Clicquot and a bottle of some Cru
Where do I go (check it out, check it out, oww)

[Bridge]
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Know when I'ma see my nigga again, I'ma see him on another day
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
Know when I'ma see my nigga again, I'ma see him on another day

[Verse 1]
Nigga ride with me
Only my real niggas ride with me
Everybody talk shit but you my dog
Though you fucked up, don't want to see you fall
Nah
Nah I want to see you ball
And I want to see you score
And I want to see you prosper
I'ma help you do it proper
And we gon' kill them haters
And collect that paper
We gon' fuck it up
We gon' fuck bad bitches, make 'em bust and cum
So nigga when you touch down
I'ma hold you down cause I'ma be around
And we gon' get the dough
And rock expensive clothes

[Verse 2]
Remember that time you fucked that bitch
Cause her main nigga was talking that shit
Damn nigga, you crazy
Always high nigga always be faded
Riding down the block, vibing out to Max B
And then we get mad lit
Plot on the game and how we gon' get shit
Well I'ma live it up
Just cause you down, don't mean I'ma give it up
Man keep your head up
I know you pissed off, I know you fed up
But it's not for long
Soon you'll be home, be making hit songs
And we gon' get the cash
And them bad bitches gon' give us ass
