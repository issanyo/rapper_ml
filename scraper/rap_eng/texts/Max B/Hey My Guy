One time for the coke wave can I get a haaanhh

[Hook: French Montana]
I pull up on the corner stuntin like hey my guy
Its mac wit da cheese hey my guy
I got it for the low-low hey my guy
You talking to the po-po hey my guy
Breaking down the brick, choppin down the rock
Break it down, bag it up, shuttin down the block (2X)

[Verse 1: Max B]
See I'm bout to start trial for this murder shit
Satan want my soul but I'm riding nigga suck a dick
Layin just to pluck a chick playin I'm gone fuck his bitch
She don't know my guy
See some niggas in the trenches that was skeemin on my ride
Bitches creamin on my ride, feenin for my high
Got the po-po got that one hand up they leaning on my guy
Fucking bitches make me sick
But I just give them the finger and keep rolling wit my guy
Keep strolling wit my guy, got mommy in the caddy and she blowing on my guy

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I pull up on the corner stuntin like hey my guy
