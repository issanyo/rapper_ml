It's ya boy biggavel

[Verse 1]
When at first I caught ya creepin
Wasn't even sleepin
She hit the speaker and bleeped him, peeped him
My nigga baseball was ready to beat him, leak him
I told my nigga Chill that they be cheatin (OWWW)
Used to spend and give you money
We used to make love and let me lick and dip in ya honey, it's funny
Because before you it was the bunny, she want me
Told me pull it out and dont even come in (OWWW)

[Hook]
I came (Oh shit, baby my bad)
You came (Cause it's the way u movin ya ass)
Stop playin' (Before I even gave you some ass you shoulda told me dat u was gonna cum)
You came (Baby I didn't mean to do it)
I came (That pussy will turn ya knees to fluid)
Stop playin' (Before I even gave you my pussy you shoulda told me dat you was gonna cum)

Is he the reason that my phone couldn't bleep through
I heard he treat you bad, heard he beat you
Bring that pussy home like ya used to do
Still on my grind I'm gettin money
Light the sour up so I can get a buzz
Is he the reason that my phone couldn't bleep through
I heard he treat you bad, heard he beat you
Bring that pussy home like ya used to do
Still on my grind I'm gettin money
Light the sour up so I can get a buzz

[Verse 2]
I used to play wit' her, lay wit' her, mate wit' her
5 nights out the week stay wit' her
Listen baby girl I used to say to her
Why you acting stank
Do more smokin & less talkin' bitch
Won't u pass dat thang
Won't you tell me that you love me
Hug me, choose me, smiley face
Mix the grand creezy with a smoothie
Pop us in a movie
Papa gotta uzi
He woozie plus he won't hesitate to use it
Baby why you stressin lemme get anotha shot
Feinds be coming by the dozen, let me get another rock
Lemme get another drop
Maybe dat in black, wit' da gripwood
Mami say she love me plus the dick good
