[Intro]
Uh, down, down, down, down
Bring it back, please, bring it back
Uh, down, down, down, down

[Hook]
Niggas keep takin' my wave
Niggas keep takin' my wave
These niggas keep takin' my wave
Niggas keep takin' my wave

[Verse]
You leave your trap, you better go and get it
I fucked with your Louie V, I thought I'd get acquitted
The woman of my dreams, I thought I couldn't hit it
Come to find out, she was just another bitch
Homie you trouble me, when you come up all these niggas ready
Niggas know I'm the supreme because I'm on the Chevy
Cause we ain't fuckin' around
We head on down to Miami bitch I hop in the Cadillac
Nigga you don't battle rap, nigga you can have it back
Matter of fact, see a bitch I like, I just hop out and grab her ass
Sexual harassment, the ladies they love it
When I touch 'em, I just fuck 'em and I leave 'em, never love 'em
Never beat 'em, [?]
People see a [?] now gimme some
Call, he never hit me up
Baller with the sippy cup
Had to put him down, he was like ATL and the wave

[Hook]
Niggas keep takin' my wave
Niggas keep takin' my wave
These niggas keep takin' my wave
Niggas keep takin' my wave

[Outro]
Uh, down, down, down, down
Bring it back, please, bring it back
Uh, down, down, down, down
