[Intro]
They loving it
Worldwide
Boss Don
PD5


[Hook]
You niggas don't want me to shine
These niggas don't want me to grind
I am about my money nigga
These niggas don't want me to live
These niggas just want me to bid
Bid, up in the prison system
Niggas know I'm about to get rich
They Know I'm about rich
Uh, I'm about to get cake
Yayo, got white, got blow


[Verse 1]
I've been cooling niggas off like the AC
One minute your hot
The next minute your not
Drop the album, nobody copped it
Nobody believed in the game
Without the boss don wave
Funny how, niggas turn funny style
I just let the money pile
Bitches scream skeet it on my tummy oww
I was in the room seeking closure, smoking on the dosure
Cru juice get me and my dudes loose
Moon roof, seen my nigga head pop out
I need a lead back out, and about to head back out
OG, niggas ain't know me
Got them put down, left them stinking
Shout to my niggas that's in Lincoln
Bezey on the arm like aqua
This niggas a lame, my life is a saga
Oscars, niggas trying cop them off the runway
Bring the gunplay, fuck my bitches in one day
Some say, Bigga you the illest nigga yet to come
Get the vest for them, and I tango with the best of them
Left with them bitches that night at the China
Drove them to the diner, I like them finer
Owwwww



[Hook]
You niggas don't want me to shine
These niggas don't want me to grind
I am about my money nigga
These niggas don't want me to live
These niggas just want me to bid
Bid, up in the prison system
Niggas know I'm about to get rich
They Know I'm about rich
Uh, I'm about to get cake
Yayo, got white, got blow
