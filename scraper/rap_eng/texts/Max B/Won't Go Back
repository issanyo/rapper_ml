*Hook*
I like to do it from the front (Do it from the front)
Bigga do it from the side (Do it from the side)
Fuck it from the back (back)
Make her scream Max, you don't know how to act
Oh I can get up on her tum (?)
She let me sit it on her tongue (sit it on her tongue)
Get her mad, cause once she go Max, she Won't Go Back

[Verse: 1]
She said the dick like grade A, Mayday
Lucky for you it's payday
Cause it cost chips just to play with the boss don
Get hooked on the sound, baby take a look at him now
He was all in just a year ago, looking all orangey
Miss I meant no disrespect so pardon me
Like carpentry, I can fix it
Handy with the tool, I'm nice. A buck 25 a slice
Let me have two, one for me one for baby
She like when I laugh, she live when I say wavy
Played me, had some other nigga in the cut that she fuck
For what? She ain't really like the strut
Once she had me it was over, gave the bitch the fuck of the night
She say I'm the love of her life
Beat it dog style on the balcony, D's got it out for me
They ever tried to beat it outta me. Damn
