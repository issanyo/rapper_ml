[Intro]
So easy
Oh so easy to the Boss Don Biggavel
Know we got that Gain Green movement
So wavy
Forget your boy
Young Los
It's Gain Green
Let's get them
Yeah


[Hook]
It's Green Gain
Wa-di-di-da-di-dum
Wa-di-di-da-di-dey
Look, I don't want to go
I ain't trying be late
Now I 'm sitting in the Beam
Our guns blow
If you think that you can get away
From fucking with us bitch
Look, I don't want to go
But you're back for skinless
Bitches that can't be trusted


[Verse 1]
Yeah
For scores seven years ago
I really couldn't care to blow
Now I am prepared to go
See unless five fifty
She on the dick bitch grind with me
Back and I Nicki
Started off on the mount two
R2-D2, you a sneaky I peaked you
I can hit from a far ride
The dark coupe sniff your ear
I am the sharpshooter
I spark two, one for me
One for the hoes
I'll smoke with them
I am just gonna lift their legs up open them
I open in, hit the dealer with the straight flush
Got my cake up
Blew it all in one day in the Jacob
I am a fake fuck
I could of spent it on some real estate
Desi with the extra clip
Shoot you out the maybeline
Dancing with the Devil
I can get out the deal today


[Hook]
It's Green Gain
Wa-di-di-da-di-dum
Wa-di-di-da-di-dey
Look, I don't want to go
I ain't trying be late
Now I 'm sitting in the Beam
Our guns blow
If you think that you can get away
From fucking with us bitch
Look, I don't want to go
But you're back for skinless
Bitches that can't be trusted



[Verse 2]
Yeah
I am on the scene again
I got more for the fiends again
They be creeping in
In and out, quick like a hit
It got you niggas scared as shit
Bezi say you're pretty cause going up
Ask for forgiveness for your sins
They say I'd never rap again
I'mma clap again
Till them all out, I ballout
Me and homes never had a fallout
I ain't like the bitch from the jumpstart
Heat was all jealous of the pope
He could never come close
Taught the nigga everything I know
New York City buy the man
He is the Hobgoblin, I am the Spider-Man
I am the type of man, with the wavy
Tell the whole world I was broke
But I just spent 80, just did
Bravy, Biggavelli where did you get your house from
You can thank Amalgam, Owwwww

From fucking with us bitch
Look, I don't want to go
But you're back for skinless
Bitches that can't be trusted
