She like chocolate from the Godiva, lollipop
Shrimps with no noodles, the whole kit and kaboodle
Mami hot, head up to the mami spot, check out my new bitch
Call her Thelma from the Third World, and she got a firm tail
Trust me, she'll earn well
All you gotta do is check ya bitches every now and then
Haters'll surround you in, meetin' at the Chow again
Seven months ago, fantasizin' about ya every move
Put you on that pedestal, put you on the better move

Bust a nut then shed a tear  take clusters of that every year
Damn this bitch was feaky, kept me right
