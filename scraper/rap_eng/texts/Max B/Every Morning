[Intro: Max B]
Gotta go in on these type of joints (you right)
I ain't gonna lie, you beat young los out with this one (do it)
You beat 'em you smashed em out, nah you smashed 'em!

[Hook: Max B]
I wake up every morning, and roll me a blunt
Come to think about it i fuck any bitch I want
But if you wanna know, most of all my bitches the bomb
She hungry, for a taste, but I'ma make her fiend, I'ma make her wait
I need my money honey!
Iyeee, Iyeee, Yiiiii, Yiii, Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Verse 1: Max B]
They finally getting enough, now
I'ma give em foreign team charter me
Money, music apart of me
I know you uncomfortable
With this music I gave you, I'ma fade you
M.d.b was a prelude, stay true!
Never let another nigga disrespect your manhood
Bigga fresher than can goods, damn good
Bitches say it taste like canday, I gave you lip sing, she touched it in miami
Cambridge, never will a nigga ride
Only thing I'm driving is a beam
Mama come take one for the team
I gave her a gillet(?), put her in the mood
She wanted an education, I put her up for school, cool
Then she graduated
Maxy baby I finally made it you gave me the energy
And these other bitches was hatin like
They had my description in the states
But fuck it, I think I need vacation

[Hook: Max B]
I wake up every morning, and roll me a blunt
Come to think about it i fuck any bitch I want
But if you wanna know, most of all my bitches the bomb
She hungry, for a taste, but I'ma make her fiend, I'ma make her wait
I need my money honey!
Iyeee, Iyeee, Yiiiii, Yiii, Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

[Verse 2: Max B]
You probably wanted the end but
I gotta give you some more
We was on tour, bullets scattered we hit the floor
Get the door, nigga that's twin, that's grease
With a 5th of Grand Cru, so now is time to hit the street
Get to meet any bitch I want to
Creamy, that's my little bother, he from another mother
Baby get under the cover, Max not a fighter I'm a lover
Let my guns do the talking, cops do the chalking
Walking, thinking, will i ever go back up in the can?
My baby need a hundred grand, just in case I breathe
She can have that, on top of what she got
Niggas always wanna be what they not
Sayin what they got:
Lot of jewelry, big cribs nigga you's a bitch
And plus you never did bid
Sayin you did a bid you don't know what you missing
Biggavell in the kitchen, got my workers they pitchin

[Hook: Max B]
I wake up every morning, and roll me a blunt
Come to think about it i fuck any bitch I want
But if you wanna know, most of all my bitches the bomb
She hungry, for a taste, but I'ma make her fiend, I'ma make her wait
I need my money honey!
Iyeee, Iyeee, Yiiiii, Yiii, Yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
