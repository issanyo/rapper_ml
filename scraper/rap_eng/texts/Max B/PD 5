Chorus:
We street niggas who keep figures, we keep heat (we keep heat?)
Oww Owwww
We're seven meals strong, bredren peel off, he won't skeet (he won't skeet?)
Pow Powwww
I stole the show without the radio, which way did he go?
Oww Owwww
Baby I'm 'bout to go, go and get my coat, I gotta go (I gotta go)
Chao Chaoooow

Verse 1:
Big crib, cannons in every room
I got the ship, Greasey he got the Chevy Doom
I can barely move when he see that shit here
See this 5th gear, I sit in a big chair
Make the final decisions wherever his head go, the nigga dead though
Fuck he need him a medical?
Better get him a nice sized box to sleep in
It's over for him, the nigga was knee-deep in
Seen him creepin', from the right side, bright side, bitches love the dick
They always say it's the right size
Nice eyes, hazel like fruit punch, lemonade
This is the season for vigilantes and renegades
Been afraid of nothin' that crossed my path bitch
He had me confused, I put him down in the casket
Drastic- measures I be taking when you bitches put my back against the wall
Fuckers be tryna blackball
Got a fat draw with nothin' but cash in it
Stash crack in it, thought I lost but I'm back in it
Heavy in the street shit, still on my one and twos
About to punish you, better put on your running shoes
Oww

Chorus:
We street niggas who keep figures, we keep heat (we keep heat?)
Oww Owwww
We're seven meals strong, bredren peel off, he won't skeet (he won't skeet?)
Pow Powwww
I start a show without the radio, which way did he go?
Oww Owwww
Baby I'm 'bout to go, go and get my coat, I gotta go (I gotta go)
Chao Chaoooow

Verse 2:
All I got is my hancock now, man down
You bitches on round cock now
Got the shit on lock but I ain't satisfied, Bigga need more
Like I'm in bed with three whores, we are
Not them niggas on TV, them niggas is weak
They never really be in the street
Hold 'em all accountable for taking out the mouths of the niggas I fucks with
Bitches, keep 'em in bunches, lunches
Dinners at the hotel suite
I'm the most hated on. And I don't eat filet mignone
Better pay me on the first and the 15th
Nigga hit me, Twenty thousand to rent me
Just for one night, I can wave you, fix you with the treatment
Keep chips, tucked in the safety deposit, closet
Everything is the opposite, I can pop ya bitch
I'm Kobe, you Radmanovich, got a lot of it
I'm the best out, stressed out, from this rap shit
Sorry you feeling left out
Guest house, Club Cocabana was the spot
These niggas that wanna rock, bet I'ma make it hot
Nigga, why you jeopardizing your career before it jumpstart, buckshot
Cover you when the pump spark. Mayday
Make you niggas walk the plank, blindfold
Bigga, I'll never go, the nigga stuck in grind mode
Oww

Chorus:
We street niggas who keep figures, we keep heat (we keep heat?)
Oww Owwww
We're seven meals strong, bredren peel off, he won't skeet (he won't skeet?)
Pow Powwww
I start a show without the radio, which way did he go?
Oww Owwww
Baby I'm 'bout to go, go and get my coat, I gotta go (I gotta go)
