[Intro]
Tommy Chrome
Oh this Domain Pain
So elegant, Owww
Gotta love this smooth shit man
It's ya boy Biggavel, yeah

[Verse 1]
I told them bitches, "Come and see me"
They be acting like it ain't nothing
I know them niggas need me
I was giving them the loot, but them niggas done blew it
I was worried 'bout moving coca then steady moving units
I was running through the streets
Steady running through bitches like I was water
Hit up them, 60 for a quarter
Had the nigga copping bags, fucking up all the scratch
I'ma dump him off that Mac, I'll dump him off and pack
I'ma dump it any nigga thinking he a thug-
Spend most of my nights drinking and thinking of the drugs
That my momma used to smoke
Yo' mommy smoked it too
Sucking dick for a couple dollars, I bet she liked to swallow
That shit makes me wanna holla, now I'm popping my collar
I don't know what you heard, but Biggaveli 'bout a dollar
You niggas ain't got a clue
Silver Surfer coming and you ain't even gotta move
Baby just cruise

[Hook]
Everybody knows my claim to fame
(Everybody knows my claim to fame)
Bet you thought I wouldn't come in and change the game
(Bet you thought I wouldn't come in and change the game)
Everybody knows these niggas is lip sing-ing
Bet you thought I wouldn't come in and change the game

[Verse 2]
I done steady talk and I stroll, all this Sour D is starting to take a toll
Nigga I'll take your hoes right from under you
Nigga they don't want you, I'ma come confront you
With 50's of Sour and that fronto
Put it on you pronto
I'm waterproof like the Columbian poncho, the head honcho
Baby I'm the Boss Don, come slores
Stunting through the NY, fronting all kinda whores
Roley rocky like dinosaur, Jurassic
Everything I hop on is a classic, know he love them glasses
Know he love them asses, baby give your pussy up
Smelling kinda funny, had to douche up
Toughest niggas envy, couldn't push me up
I don't need you fools, cocksucker got stingier
Copped a AM B, cause I'm busier
Don't say shit to me, I ain't playing trick
Hit you with the caine shit, look at how he play with it
Oww
