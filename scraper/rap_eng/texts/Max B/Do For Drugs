What You Won't Do For Drugs?
You Think You Got Everything, But You Gonna Need Drugs
You Pawned Your Jewels (Pawned Your Jewels) For Drugs
You Tried Everything But You Gone Need Drugs

Verse:

I Should Have Knew You Was Trouble Right From The Start
You Stood In MY Corner When That Bitch Broke My Heart
You Came Through, Kept A Brother Up, I Maintained But You Tried To Set A Nigga Up
Fuck It, I Wouldn't Risk, Knowing Im Living On The Edge
Keep My Burner, 9-1-3 In His Head, Coppers Come And We Fled
It Was Me, Unc & Bugalo. Im Really The One, Know Tell Me What You Gonna Do
I Think I Need A 50 Piece, That Shit Will Get Me Right, Get Me High
We Running Through The City Fly, Bitches Love When We Fuck
Love When We Come & Light Em Up, Bite Em Up
Baby Come Get In The Truck (What You Wanna Do?)

(Hook)

(French Montana)

Feenes Love The Aroma, Catch Me Outside With My Vest & My Armor

Gone Hang My Phone, Meet Me Outside, Don't Make It Obvious Jump Up In The Ride

(Max B Outro)

I Miss You Darling Where You Been? I Been In Court All Day And I Need A Smoke
Dont Sip That Goose, Never Fucks With Gin
I Gotta Thing For Grand Cru & I Can't Let Go
