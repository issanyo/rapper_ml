[Intro: Max B]
Yeah
Nice introduction
Matter of fact
We don't need no introduction man
There's only a couple of niggas that can ride this bomb-ass Grease beat
It's Dame Grease wave aye
Got the boy Al Pac with me on this one again
Got a little classic back with Dame Grease
Let's go
The Dour

[Verse 1: Max B]
Tell them loosen up
Two hundred I spend on all my drawers
Blow up my baby powder and my polo [?]
Bitches know me out in Pelham
They tell me "Max B I wish that you could put your dick in the package"
Got a nigga running with the ratchet
Steady trapping them niggas off
Nigga we drinking
We got that henny oh
Got the semi off in my enemies
Praying that they die slow
Cops are just steady coming
We running from the five-oh
Yeah them bitches they got nothing on [?] Max
This is the truest fucking song
[?]
Put your [?]
Go on to the left
Let a nigga grip
You know how the bigga get
You know how to hit a lick
When you [?] beat bread
Just bring ham if you need it for the hit
Keep a forty by the pillow
I'll shoot him in his sleep too
All you got to say is where to meet you

[Hook: Max B]
I wonder if I chase you home
Just talk about it
Or even made you taste this chrome
Shock the party
I wonder if I stayed too long
Would you still want to fuck baby
Because I'm scheming tonight

[Verse 2: Al Pac]
One of the hardest out
Smoke like a chimney
Birds trying to ride the wave
Don't have the remedy
I'm sipping on Hennessy
Riding on my enemies
I'ma be a menace so you niggas ain't getting rid of me
Think I can't fuck with whoever
Then put your money up
Slugs from the fifth
Guarantee They'll tear your tummy up
Gotti got his money up bitch
So I wanted war
Niggas get out of line
Hit them with the forty-four
Gang Green
That's the team
Bitch we tear the strip up
Ten guns flipped up
Quick to shoot your whip up
Steady clean
Looking mean
Five-thirty-five high
Born well-loved from Compton to Bedstuy
Biggavel
Young Pac
Front to make the gun pop
I'm the king of the city
These little niggas run blocks
If rap don't work, then It's back to the street
It's must to go hard on a Dame Grease beat
Preach

[Hook: Max B]
I wonder if I chase you home
Just talk about it
Or even made you taste this chrome
Shock the party
I wonder if I stayed too long
Would you still want to fuck baby
Because I'm scheming tonight

[Verse 3: Max B]
I heard she was a ten
And despite of her husband
I heard she get it in (she get it in, yeah)
Let me tell you niggas how she dipping around the bed
She get it around the head
I'ma hit you with plenty more
Baby girl
You ain't give me your all
Bigga ain't got no penny for hoes
I'll make her do plenty chores
In every thirty seconds
The remy pours
Yeah, give me more
Semi soft
Daddy need him a rub down
Dust down
Nigga we putting in
Look at the money pile
I'm copping they see me in the Beam
Nigga squeeze
[?]
He ain't supposed to have that
Fifty stacks down
Fuck the cash back
Fuck the stash at
Biggaveli
The class act
[?] into the left
Look at him go
Damn, they let they let the boys run
Selling your pussy just like a car girl

[Hook: Max B]
I wonder if I chase you home
Just talk about it
Or even made you taste this chrome
Shock the party
I wonder if I stayed too long
Would you still want to fuck me baby
Because I'm scheming tonight

[Outro: Max B]
Yeah
This is wavy

Biggavel
Al Pac
You know
This shit is wavy over here man
Know you niggas wish you could do joints like these
