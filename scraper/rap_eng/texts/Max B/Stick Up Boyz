Hahaha

[Verse 1: Claude Antonio]
Cleaning up the mess, that's what a nigga do
Shortie got big breasts and a fat ass too
I be hot in the streets nigga
I'ma make you sweat cause I'm bringing the heat nigga
I be on my shit, like a fly nigga
Look at my gear, I'm so fly nigga
Everybody know I'm getting paid
Man I just stole your bitch, and now I'm getting laid
I don't need no handouts, I got my own shit
You know I stand out, I got ownership
Everybody know I own this shit
Stop asking me for help, cause I don't owe you shit
I be in the county, they call it Hudson
They know about me, they know I'm runnin'
And I'm balling like I'm Steph Curry
From West Harlem, all the way to North Jersey

[Hook: Max B]
If you hit me I'm a hit ya back
We got 'em on the Rose, Oww
If you stick me I'm a stick you back
I got 'em fuckin' with hoes, Oww
Make ya get 'em girl, gunnin', we down, we done stick 'em
Big Mac come they sorry they ever dick him
Cop a 7, we drivin' late in the sixes
Convicts, gun under the armpit
Ow Ow

[Verse 2: Max B]
Lightin' niggas up with the heater bro, my seat is low
They fold up like that Peter Rowe
Get 'em in the mood off the versatile, squirt it loud, baby let me beat it
Kuz I can make it worth ya while
I can do it easy, sleazy, niggas speak and revokin' my bail
They be scared to smoke it in jail, well
I was weekly, creeply, sticks, smoked 'em at a fast pace
Kuz mami this ya last take
Came in, only dropped the the glee way, had 'em play DJs
Heat spray, we spray the enemies, Frienemies? (Naw)
Big'll wiggle like the centipede, yeah
I be in and out, I can clear the tenants out
I can clear ya minutes out with one conversation, waitin'
Stakin' in the hallway, pacin'
Niggas they be hatin', makin' shit that don't matter to the game
Cause most of you niggas is lames
Ow

[Hook: Max B]
If you hit me I'm a hit ya back
We got 'em on the Rose, Oww
If you stick me I'm a stick you back
I got 'em fuckin' with hoes, Oww
Make ya get 'em girl, gunnin', we down, we done stick 'em
Big Mac come they sorry they ever dick him
Cop a 7, we drivin' late in the sixes
Convicts, gun under the armpit
Ow Ow

[Verse 3: Claude Antonio]
Shortie got a snatch, that put me in a coma
She smell so nice a nigga feeling the aroma
Pistols loaded aiming at a fuck nigga
When we come around, you better duck, nigga
I'm 'bout to spark a nigga like a lighter
I'ma make that nigga cry until he retire
Smoke a nigga like a cigarette
Finesse your bitch, cause she ain't met a real nigga yet
I'm just a young nigga with a lot of heart
You a funny nigga, like Kevin Hart
You be cracking jokes, like your life nigga
You a fucking joke, I fucked your wife nigga
I'm 'bout to splurge on a Gucci hat
I see that piece, what you gonna do with that?
Quit playing, cause you ain't gonna do shit
You just trying to flex, but you a little bitch

[Hook: Max B]
If you hit me I'm a hit ya back
We got 'em on the Rose, Oww
If you stick me I'm a stick you back
I got 'em fuckin' with hoes, Oww
Make ya get 'em girl, gunnin', we down, we done stick 'em
Big Mac come they sorry they ever dick him
Cop a 7, we drivin' late in the sixes
Convicts, gun under the armpit
Ow Ow
