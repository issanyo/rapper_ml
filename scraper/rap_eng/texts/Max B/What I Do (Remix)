[Hook: Max B]
? in the ghetto

[Verse 1: Max B]
I'm Heavy B, ?
Crusin in that Beemer, like i'm 70
? in the 50 zone
? shit we go
Look at all that ?
Put it all up on that scale, right
Bet it come back ?
These bitches best belive in me, when I tell m "let me take you out the ghetto that you liven in"
? bout all these Benjamans
Make them suck and fuck ?
? at night
Pimpin was my way of life
Slippin in the favorite ?
Left my bitch alone?
Tryna ? the game

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Hit m if he actin up, bread I be stackin up
Work, I be baggen up
Homie, that's what I do
Young ? up in ?
Niggas come and fill yo head
? in the head, homie, that's what I do
In the hood I was borne and raised
Homie ghetto bound, life is a bitch, Imm tryna settle down
Another round's gonna hit you up, slit you up
Parametics get you up
Coke Boys fix you up
Welcome to the hood, the corner ?
Niggas foming at the mouth, lookin for a jackpot
Silverback ? I be sellin ?
We got the streets, ?
We don't hop on bief, a whole lot of heat
We never see, homie I'm Ray Charles
Nigga, we got the streets
