Mama, she tryna touch the yayo
We say "Yo, what you need, we got D, we got weed, we got E”
(We got, we got)
She cop it and she love to stay high
Her money good, good, good, she smoke it time after time
So pop the top, we'll put one in ya girl
This is that bone bone bone, let's smoke a couple pieces and chill
I got these bitches looking thirst' for a blunt
This not ordinary day in the hood, this is the first of the month

[Verse 1:]
Started out as a little itty baby in this cold, cold world
His poppa had a boy and girl, stressed her momma out
Now she doin' drugs, moving through the city streets
Clean teeth, used to have them pretty feet
Now she pretty weak, from the drug use, fucking all them ballers for they cash
There's war when I got pot to pass, flew 'em in
Dolo in the crib, tryna fix something to eat
Tryna get something that's sweet so we can sleep, "Don't lay on the sheets”
Momma she be dripping blood, from the needle in and out of veins
This joint gon' bring you lots of pain, lots of rain
Staring out the window as my poppa waving bye to me
"Baby where the TV, why you lie to me"
Riding we, gunning from my robberies, treating 'em like bitches from the past
Style on 'em as I watch 'em pass
Watch that nigga dash like he in and out
Carlo, he told me, "Wrap that package up and send it out"
It's the first of the month

[Verse 2:]
They had a nigga sitting in the county jail wondering
"What's life, I am done with' it”. Run with' it
Baby you can be a star, won't you just ask Maxi B
Look at how I'm running through they faculty. Back to back with me
Was my right hand, telling all my business in the street
Said I got it from Dyckman, lightning, piping
Hot, we got burners, and them bundles, we can furnish
Done seen niggas get murdered, I can tell you more
Pumping out the corner store, kept my little look-out in the front
My dudes just moved 'em out the trunk
"Million Dollar Baby Volume One and Two” I love it boo
Classic like that G-funk sound, I fucks with you
Biggavell, I don't think you really know, how wavy you are
You's a star. The fiends, I let 'em park my car
Dipping out the back when I see the Jakes
She need a taste. Chasin' that paper, she left a trace
It's the first of the month

[Verse 3:]
My grandma passed, I really miss her. Couldn't go to the funeral and kiss her
In the cell I was staring at her picture
She never liked my way of life, told me I would pay the price
Riding on my foes got me gliding on these hoes
Feeling like some other type of nigga
Come and fuck with the Bigga, we can live it up
One day I'm gon' give it up
Be a family man and settle down with a wife and kid. Nigga you so trifling
Nigga don't be tryna spit that righteous shit, you ain't but a bitch
And baby I don't like that shit
Staying out late, tryna come home when you want
Tryna come and roll a blunt, tryna come and go for what
You ain't really wanna be my man, Max. Damn, Max
Baby you best to stand back. I can't stand that
Every time you get around your friends you be, starting yo shit again
On the first of the month
