Verse 1
French montana:
100 grand, rubber band
A nigga low, a wanted man
Sure you're right, I know ya high
Talkin' crazy, run for your life
They can't believe, nuttin' new hot as me
Money can't buy the streets
I been paid, my men spray
100 rounds, sound like merengue
Or the Nolia Clap, it's only rap
That's what they thought, now it's 40 on ya hat
What's the matter huh
I'm the new breath of fresh air, like a asthma pump
Representing
My militant squad that snatch you out ya car that you're renting
Told 'Kon put ya leg up
Five stacks on the floor, watch homie fuckin' dig up

Lightin' niggas up with the heater bro, my seat is low

Get 'em in the mood off the versatile, squirt it loud, baby let me beat
Kuz I can make it worth ya while
I can do it easy, sleazy, niggas speak and revokin' my bail
They be scared to smoke it in jail, well
I was weekly, creeply, sticks, smoked 'em at a fast pace
Kuz mami this ya last take
Came in, only dropped the the glee way, had 'em play DJs
Heat spray, we spray the enemies, Frienemies? (Naw)

Verse 3
French Montana:
Shorty from the Lou', she take it in the cunt
And niggas talkin' crazy, I'm shakin' in my boots
A couple thou, I'm Mr. Childs
Street nigga, like Kevin Chiles
You got a V6, I got a 6 V's
My young boys turn ya brains to swiss cheese
A proper team, I mean badabing
With a model bitch in the back gargling
I'm so high, open cooch baby
I told Grease, let me loose baby
Coupe 280, flyin' through 80
R.I.P. to my dude Adee
My transition is phenomenal
Still hop out, cop tapes and Amadu
My lil' brother bail, 'bout a half a mill
French Montana, everything signed and sealed

Big Mac come they sorry they ever dick him
Cop a 7, we drivin' late in the sixes
Convicts, gun under the armpit
