[Verse 1]
You ain't a friend to me, I sip that Hennessy
Your bitch she love the dick, bet she remember me
Bet I remember her, like I'm a kin to her
My shit was meant for her, Fridays I spend with her
I been with her, all she want is deez
I made her retire haze, now all she want is sneeze
Man all she want is the cheese, but I don't give a shit
Let her work out, fuck with mines, I'm a murk you out
You ain't tryna fuck around, get your head split
Toss the ratch in the yard, coky I can get live
Nigga I'll be dead rich (fuck it) give it all to my son
Spend it all, get ya gun, spin the ball, hit ya one
That ya love and that ya hug and all
Crazy, had a baby, what bitch, presidential with the wavy wrist
My bitch got the Mercedes six, now I'm back in the cut
Tell police stop fucking Tru-Life in his butt


[Hook x2]
Ya'll some part time lovers, y'all fuck under the covers
That's ya mother, ya'll supposed to be brothers
But y'all lovers, that's nasty
That ain't wavy, oh baby



[Verse 2]
I'm heavy in the loop, dezzy in the Coupe
Bezzie and a suit, one day I'll go to court
His friend's a nasty man, fuck Kim Kardashian

His bitches love my cum (cum) so I let 'em drink
Fuck me, I'll give you ring, popo gon' leave you stink
You know I leave you weak, nigga I am the streets
Nigga you are a bitch, Bigga, he far from rich
Bigga, you are the shit, so let these niggas know
So let the blicker blow, already hit your hoe (already hit her)
Already gets the dough, scrape shit off the books
Get your melon booked, you ain't know Biggavell a crook
Bunch of gay rap niggas, tryna make a name nigga
Tryna Silver Surf nigga, tryna make a wave nigga

[Hook]
Y'all some part time lovers, y'all fuck under the covers
That's ya mother, y'all supposed to be brothers
But y'all lovers, that's nasty
That ain't wavy, oh baby
