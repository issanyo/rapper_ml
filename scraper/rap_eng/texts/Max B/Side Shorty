(Hook)
Girl would you be my side shorty

Even if i had a wifey

Would you still ride with me, even if you couldn’t be with me

Girl would you be my side shorty

Even if i had a wifey

Would you still ride with me, even if you couldn’t be with me

(Max B Verse)
If you a'int a freak i can make you one

The ghetto you living in i can take you from

Buy you things and give you all of the cake you want

Max is the only nigga that make you cum

Only i could make ya, feel all heavenly

Bring you to the dealership, peel off 70

Rough day at the job, i can be your energy

Hit me on the v3 i can be your remedy

Tryna be your road dog baby not your enemy

Twist a lil sizzurp, mix it wit the Hennessy

Fall back, had a Lil more than i simply

Max and the dipset, about to make history

Through your spell, but i never let it get to me

Both wrists glissery broke bitch picture me

Relax your self and come play wit the boy

Take a trip to the bin lay in bed with the boy

Girl would you be my side shorty

Even if i had a wifey

Would you still ride with me, even if you couldn’t be with me

Girl would you be my side shorty

Even if i had a wifey

Would you still ride with me, even if you couldn’t be with me
