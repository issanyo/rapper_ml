[Intro]
Let's get it
I wanna take you on a journey
I wanna take you on a journey
Back in the day of mine, back in the day of my rhymes
Let's take it back and rewind

[Chorus]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

{Verse 1]
I tend to recollect on some things
I look at what's been done and think bout what's next for me
And what's next for me is based off my dreams
So better get going before I lose this thing like Hillary (
I started rapping when I was 10 years old
I'm still rapping now and I'm 15 years bold
15 years cold, but I feel like this my time to shine because i feel god is opening up doors that i can call mine

[Chorus]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 2]
I'm a wildebeast with the similes
Metaphors and agility
Serve the one nobility gives me peace and tranquility
I may be young but you feeling me
I may be small but you seeing me
When I place a beat underneath my feet to realize what my life meant to be
I remember my first time writing a rhyme
I would figure out ways to put in the time
Always trying to define my left from my right
To scope out what I should put in my sights
I know it gonna be alright
With my savior God on my side
Got some words to rock on a mic
And even got some ryhmes that glorify christ

[Chorus]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Bridge]
Now clap your hands if you want to go back in the day
(Back in the day!!)
Clap your hands if you want to go back in the day
(Back in the day!!)

[Chorus]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Outro]
Take me back, take me back, take me back now (x4)
Take me back, take me back, take me back now
