[Intro]
And I really miss
It's a shame the way you're doin' me baby
It's a shame the way you do that

[Chorus]: [x2]
I wanna be with you boy, I need you in my life
I really miss you
It's a shame the way you doin' me baby
But I'm tryin' to handle biz and baby that's how it is

[Verse One]
Well, I'm the new kid on the block that rocks
But see it hasn't always been like that
Cause I remember back when
My mom was broke and I was bummy
They nicknamed me Donna
Cause every Summer I worked Hard For The Money
I scratched and I scrapped to get my raps straight
To be the best man
Wanted more, never less than
Eventually it paid off
I got paid
Money made off me when I bust
Made it possible to live plush
Just because I don't rob for loot that don't mean I
Have to wear suits like Mr. Bob Dobalina
You'll never see me go broke
No chance
I refuse to be a Jo Jo dancer
First I'll handle biz that's how it is

[Chorus]: [x2]
I wanna be with you boy, I need you in my life
I really miss you
It's a shame the way you doin' me baby
But I'm tryin' to handle biz and baby that's how it is

[Verse Two]
Well one's for the money
Then two's when you should bet it on Ahmad
Cause I got more funk then Redman's ?
And +Crew's Pop+ but I'm no Younsta
So the funks away
I make my livin' and I'm driven
While brothers get drunk and stay bent I gotta pay rent
Just doin' what I can, the man
Like tomb rocks out of your boom box
And
Never gave up
Kept up my head, stopped
And gave it all got cause it counts
The way the balls bounce
Even when I didn't make tapes
I was the rapper with the soul check it
Now that I do
I'm that same rapper with a gold record
Ain't nothin' changed but the weather and it's still hot
Damn, now here's a list of what I still got
I still got my family and I still could get betta
I still got my homies and I still got my Jetta
A better man's me, to do the job cause I'm a veteran
Nod your head instead of my misses
Be amiss that's how it is

[Chorus]: [x2]
I wanna be with you boy, I need you in my life
I really miss you
It's a shame the way you doin' me baby
But I'm tryin' to handle biz and baby that's how it is

[Verse Three]
I bust
This time I'm kickin' up dust because you won't hush
I gotta make dough but you don't hear me though
I hear you'd rather hoo ride
So you can shoo fly and just don't bother me
When I'm a star you'll be the first one to holler, "We
Can do this"
I did it way back like Michael Cooper and
You threw me out when we lived on Louis Lane
Now that I'm Superman
You be tryin' to ride all on my jock
Cause I rock
Like a Spin Doctor, but I guess you learn, like an intern
That
All play and no work is an antidote to stay broke
And I'll never have low income
Cause I want it all, and then some
Dumb
Niggerette, see I figure that I get wreck
I'm on the road to riches in showbiz
That's how it is

[Singing]
I can't understand why you do me this way
I give you all my love each and every day
Don't want my love cause you're blowin' my mind

[Chorus]: [x2]
I wanna be with you boy, I need you in my life
I really miss you
It's a shame the way you doin' me baby
But I'm tryin' to handle biz and baby that's how it is
