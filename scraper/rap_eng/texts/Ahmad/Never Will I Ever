{Intro]
*go outside
I can't go out-i can't go outside
I can't go out-i can't go outside*
Aye

[Verse]
Look at these bitches they mad
Because they don't belong to me
She said she miss what we had
But that don't mean shit to me
I don't know how to chop for a soul
These ni**as they enemies
I constantly walk with a pole
Because they out to get me
Watch them be acting like that
She know that she can't give me back
Nowadays im on the back
Because these ni**as be a snake in the grass
I am the one for you
But you not the for me
Little Bit why can't you see
I ride off out with your bestie

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn right i said
She sent me texts and i read it
My diamonds so cold like anemic
I am a menace like dennis
Told them me like for the dentist
I got the racks on me-swear to god that i never played tennis

[Chorus]
Can't go out-I can't go outside i can't go out
I won't go outside i can't go out i won't go outside
I can't go out-I won't go outside
Like noo (i know)
Noo-Ooh I know (I know)
Noo-Ooh I know (I know)
Noo-Ooh I know (I know)
Noo-Oooh

[Outro]
*Can't go out i can't go outside i can't go out
I won't go outside i can't go out i won't go outside
I can't go out i won't go outside like No-ooh aye
Noo-ooh i kno-oow*
