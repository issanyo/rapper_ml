[Verse 1: Tena Jones]
I'm getting tired of games
Put up with you a year and a half
And you still ain't changed
So I'm out the door
Why you acting like
I'm saying something I ain't never said before
When I block my phone, go on!
Don't be looking for me at my mama's
Leave me alone
I'm sick of you
And all of this drama you putting me through

[Hook: Tena Jones]
If he really wanna be with me
We can start a family
If not then brother, move on
Move on, just go away (go away)
'Cause I ain't got time to play
Working nine to five all day
Know what? You can move on, just move on

Don't be coming with no drama, don't be coming with that
Don't be coming with no drama, can't be coming with that
Don't be coming with no drama, don't be coming with that
Move on, keep moving on

[Verse 2: Tena Jones]
(I don't play)
I can't believe you got me feeling this way
(Like Whitney)
Brother, it's not alright, but yeah, it's okay
(Any day)
Now I be leaving out, I'm moving away
Don't talk about it, prove it to me to stay
I had to pray when I was hoping to get back with you too
But you ain't ready, on the regular, be acting a fool
Like confetti in the wind, went wherever you blew
But now I'm tired and too old pretend
That's why I'm through

[Ahmad]
You don't understand that I bust on line for line
And on fam, impeccable timing
Rappers in front of me shining
Trying to catch them from behind and
It's true, no man's an island
So I'm through clubbing and wilding
No running from commitment
Trying to do four minute mile and
Now with you I'm always smiling
Because I love a challenge
You gray, girl, let me smother you with color from my palette
You say I'm tripping, be thinking I'm talking smack
But if I walk out the door baby I won't come back
How many times I done put up with your whining huh?
Girl if you don't appreciate me I'ma find someone
Ahmad is real with it, you know I ain't trying to play
You feeling me, all my homies say

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jabu]
Your mama looking at me like {sucks teeth}
"What my daughter see in this dreadlock having..."
Always have me like I'm being frisked
Bought me a new car, you bang the keys like a pianist
Your mama say she hate it
Then why she always be in it?
Plushy in my BM, why I dress this way
Had to tell her Jab rocks like "I'm Shante"
Plus, I love your daughter, I treat her like she Nefertiti
Man she never needy
And she ain't ask me what I bought her
Kinda homey cause her moms was lonely when Pops jetted
The only thing I'm leaving is "podiums hot," get it?
So hold tight, no time for pressure, play the zone
I'm sure you know I love you, but I heard you on the phone
You said

[Hook]
