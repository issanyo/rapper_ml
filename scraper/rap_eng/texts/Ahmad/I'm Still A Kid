I remember waiting for mama while she was with the doctor
Purporting the floor in the room was lava
Take it back to when the daffodils granted wishes
When I was timid of swimming in the pool cuz of creatures in the deep
Where the only times I had to weep were from scabs
Take it back to when my brotha was my mentor
When we played Pokemon
And yugioh
To when the only medicine was pepto bismo
Take it back to when we were to young to feel
Where we knew boys and girls were nothing but trouble
To when materials were the source of our smiles
Take it back to when we were energetic kids playing tag
Running for miles
Where hey arnold and rugrats were on nickelodeon
To when we use to play make believe
That's when we lived out our dreams

I wish I was still a kid
That's a part of my life I never got to live
But I remember it
In my heart, I'm still a kid

My dream was to be an astronaut
I knew I'd be out of this world from the very start
Take it back to when I would only itch doing somersaults
Take it back to when I was never at fault

I wish I was still a kid
That's a part of my life I never got to live
But I remember it
In my heart, I'm still a kid

I remember when times were simple
My only obstacle was going to school with a pimple
Wanted to live reckless and be Irresponsible
Now I have to fill out applications
Get an education
Work for the hourly wage
Have connections dismayed
I'm forced to play a game that's not meant to be played
The challenges I'm facing are monsters I can't tame
The words spoken from the mouth
I never thought I'd be picking up so many grains
Root beer turned into liquor
Cooties became herpies
Allowances turned into pay checks
Special Bonds turned into replacements
Reality came supersonic
Now life is chaotic

I wish I was still a kid
That's a part of my life I never got to live
But I remember it
In my heart, I'm still a kid

Our childhood is on a continuum
It's gone
The day we decide to grow up
When our youthfulness and judgement are misguided into this frowned upon routine
The worst day of your life use to be when it was raining
Now the world is knocking you down without permission
Disassembling everything
Even the slightest catastrophes are bothering
Times were easier cuz we had no awareness of what was happening
If I could take it back to one time period
I'd take it back to when I was a kid
