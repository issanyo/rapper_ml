[Verse One]
Kick it, well I'm up first
Another first for my bros and my niggaros
And I'm makin' noise for homeboys
Like back when I was little
Had a normal route
Used to knock on the door, yell, "Can Damien come out?"
That's the homie that's been there
Ever since I can remember
Tight, we used to ball from the pole to the street light
Fight a little, make up, then break up quickly
And eight minutes later
We get caught stealin' out of Thriftys
But I had his back and he had mine
You deserve to do the time if you're doin' the crime
But we didn't see it that way so we break north
Through the double doors
Couldn't get into trouble cause moms was on the lookout
So we was on the Diamondback, bookin'
My boy and his bike
Had to be in before the streetlights
Get home fast
Sit on the steps, reminisce and laugh
About that day and all the joy with my homeboy

[Chorus]
So who comes first?
The homeboys come first
Tell me who comes first?
The homeboys come first
Yell it who comes first?
The homeboys come first
And make some noise
If you're down for your homeboys
Ohhh
So who comes first?
The homeboys come first
Tell me who comes first?
The homeboys come first
Yell it who comes first?
The homeboys come first
Cause even when you feel low
You still got your niggaro

[Verse Two]
Well it's the niggaro
Back to hit the game
Win a baller with a two hand tap
Against the glass, then I kick ass
Homeboys first upon my list
So a chick can miss me actin' lonely
No hoe before the homie
Ever since I was a kid I used to wish I was grown up
I would have a child, have a wife and live the good life
Strife got in the middle
It's a little bad
Learned that girls were only out to get what niggas have
So down smashes my hopes
That I might rope a woman that can do no wrong
If I could sing then I'd write a song like
Whoa are the troubles of a worrisome man
It's easy to make a baby
But it's hard to find a good lady
But I'm cool though
I've still got my niggaros
?
So I guess I'm doin' okay
And one day
I may be at a club and find a woman that's the real mccoy
But for now I got my homeboys

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Well this is one last verse
Tellin' you to put your niggas first
At the top of the pole
Then give it up if you got soul
And to those of you who get rich quick
And struggled where the homies live at
So don't forget to give back
Don't know much
But I'll tell you what I do know clown
Quick as you come up is as quick as you can go down
Friends have your back till the end
Or for better or worse
So it pays to always put your homeboys first

[Chorus]
