[Hook 1]x8
Back in the days
When I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But somedays
I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1: Azure]
Grey photos all around me
Constant flashbacks surrounding
The sound of classic 808s and echos
Bass and the drums on my first Demo
LOUD EP incase you never got the memo
Out of the 9 songs the only good one was "Pharaoh"
Amount of positive feedback: zero
Released it for free, needed no dinero
Voice so high pitched you'd thought I was Pharrell
Tell the truth, the EP was terrible
7 projects later and I started getting better
Grey photos falling down like dominoes
The audio of the microphones from a long time ago
Echo throughout the studio
Echo throughout the studio

[Hook 1]x4
Back in the days
When I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But somedays
I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 2: Azure]
Remember me?
I'm your father, the one who left you
You've been on my mind so you know I won't forget you
I left you years ago, and now I'm regretful
I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you
If it means spitting on this track, then it's worth it
These are lines from the original wordsmith
I like how you make rhymes with purpose
When I first heard your music, I was wordless
Let's take this grey photo
Like its a promo
I missed you too
But let's keep that on the low tho
Bars so sharp like they were shot from a crossbow
Say cheese for this grey photo

[Hook 2]x2
Back in the day
When I was young
Im not a kid anymore
But now Im fucking happy that I grew up
