It Began On A Stunning October Evening
I Was The Most Generous Singer Around
She Was The Most Stunning Actor
She Was My Friend
Oh My God!
Oh My God!
My Stunning Friend
My Actor
We Used To Chat So Well Together
Back In The Day
When I Was Young
I'm Not A Kid Anymore
But Some Days
I Say I Wish I Was A Kid Again
We Wanted To Talk Together, Around The World
We Wanted It All
Man Did We Have A Good Time
But One Evening, One Stunning Evening
We Decided To Break Things Apart
Because We're Not Meant To Be Together
Oh My God!
Oh My God!
We Were Never Meant To Be Together At The First Place
I Know, I Know
We'll Never Meant To be Together
We Started A Crack Between Us
I Don't Know What Just Happened
It Was Wild, So Wild
From That Moment, Our Relationship Changed
And She Took Me By Suprise
I Don't Know, Know
This Guy Told Me What Was Going On
From That Moment Our Relationship Changed
She Wasn't Getting Paid That Much
Because I Was The Most Generous Singer Around
The Rumors Started Breaking Apart
Took Papa To Another Grave
'Cause She'll Be On My Way
Oh I Never Got A Chance To See Her
Because We Had To Break It Apart
And Then It Happened
Oh No!
Hell No!
Oh Oh!
No No!
Oh No!
She Stabbed A Dentist!
Alas She Killed A Dentist!
My Friend Killed The Dentist!
She Was Going Crazy
So Crazy, So Crazy
She Will Never Lose
The Next Day
She Was Taken To Jail
Sentenced To Life In Prison
'Cause He Was My Only Dentist
I Thought My Heart Had Burs-ted Into Flames
(But I Was Actually Overreacting A Little)
But Still, I Thought She Was Innocent
So, I Convinced The Judge To Let Her Go Free
On The Terms That I Would Get Back With Her Again
Now Back To That Stunning October Evening
She Never Shut That Phone
I Will Just Find That
I Will Just Find You
In The Middle Of Time
She Will Love Me Again
And Take Her Together
'Cause I Found Her
She'll Even Know
She Will Never Know
She Will Never Be Alone
This Is The End Of The Story
Goodbye My Friends
