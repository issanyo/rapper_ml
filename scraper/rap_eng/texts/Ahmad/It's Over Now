My man Ahmad
Ahmad Jones
4th Avenue Jones
That's how we do it y'all
It's not done
But it's over

[Verse 1:]
I want some Brand Nubian, Pac, and Rakim, Biggie, Nas
Really don't make emcees like they used to
Freestyle Fellowship, D.O.C., Pharaoh Monche
Jay, Ahmad, and Thought from the Roots crew
It's a hood who's who
Now what you dudes do?
Make a wack album? Pay Lil' Jon?
Do two dope beats for the streets to introduce you?
But you weak, we know we got heat
What *you* do?
Sick of hype, homie, is you tight or boo boo?
I'm precise wit mine, done diced a few fools
Got strikes for servin' on mics you new to
From the life where if you ain't nice, we boo you
Boo hoo, go ahead, cry if you wanna
What you got's not hot
They rock mine every corner
Homie can't see me
If he try he a goner
Plus, he must be smokin' that Thai marijuana

[Chorus:]
It's over now (uh huh)
I told y'all it's over now (say what?)
We off in them Range Rovers now (ooooh)
It won't stop but it's over now (up jump the boogie)
It's over now (uh huh)
I told y'all it's over now (whatcha say?)
We got money to fold up now (ooooh)
It don't stop but it's over now (don't stop the boogie)

Hold up, you are now experiencing
What we call Soundsational

[Verse 2:]
Ahmad's goin' through a carpenter phrase
Carvin' up stages and mics
With tight rhymes sharper than razors
Fools talk so often
I'm made to defeat these MCs in 3
Like StojakoviÄ‡, Peja
See whatever you got and I raise ya
Man, who you kiddin'?
Poppin' ya lip, then hit me back when I page ya
With it whatever, whenever
I'm too clever, you'll never do nothin' to my crew ever
We heavyweights to you feathers
Paragraphs to letters, we the Jags, you Jettas
You backspins, we more advanced like Capoeira
Avenue band stands apart where fans set us
Y'all loose, we tighter than Bruce Bruce's sweaters
Rock with top sellers, so hot they got jealous
Haters pop a lot, we not gon' stop, fellas
Every rhyme's divine, we shine cause God let us
Grind until we platinum, lyin' in Barbados

[Chorus] (2x)

[Vamp:]
Beep beep da bump da bump bump
Beep beep da bump da bump bump
Beep beep da bump da bump bump
Beep beep da bump da bump bump
You gots ta

Avila Brothers on the track

Ha! It's over now!
