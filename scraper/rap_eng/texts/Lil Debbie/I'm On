[Verse 1]
Uh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Life moves fast and it comes in stages
Some hit big and the rest stay nameless
Cameras flash and you hit front pages
Been paid dues now it's back to the basics
Cops come around, bet a bitch, don't say shit
All I know is real big chick, no fake shit
Talk big and don't take shit
Give a bitch an inch and they gon' take 10
I ain't never came up in this shit to make friends
Trust as far as I can throw 'em when the day ends
All I do is talk shit, never chase trends
Bitch come around, turn this motherfucker out
Not a doubt or a co-sign
Kickin' down the door, now it's go time
And if a bitch got time that's off my grind
I tell 'em stay about your business 'cause I'm on mine

[Hook]
So, if you don't know, now you know
Got the pills, got the dope for the low
I done moved out the trap and I'm never going back
But I'm still the same bitch from before
Let 'em know what it is hoe, what's up
Ain't a damn thing changed, I ain't never give a fuck
Got my city goin' up, couple grams in the blunt goin' up
Fifth of Henn in the cup
And you know I'm 'bout to drink that shit 'til the motherfucker gone
Smoke that shit 'til the motherfucker gone
Shake my shit turn a motherfucker on

[Verse 2]
Finally I'm in the spot that I wanna be
Everything I worked for is right in front of me
Silly bitches under me
I'm the bitch bitches wanna be, there's only one of me though
Bitches say I'm livin' comfortably, oh?
It's cause I'm killin' off my last shit
Last chick standing from my past clique
Probably cause I'm real, no plastic
Probably cause they countin' bitches
I outta outlast 'em, kill 'em out the game
Hit the track and I gas it
0 to 100 real quick, same bitch
Change the game shit, like it ain't shit
Don't trip this is it but I bet it won't slip, no fumbles
Now they talkin', we don't hear 'em mumble
Bitch come around and turn this motherfucker out
Not a doubt or a co-sign
Now I'm outta reach, hit my own line
And if a bitch got time that's off my grind
I tell 'em bitch you know we sittin' on a gold mine?

[Hook]
