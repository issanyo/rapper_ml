[Intro]
If you're going to court, I'd kill for you
If you're crossing the street, I won't be there
If you're going to court, I'd kill for you
If you're crossing the street

[Chorus: Lil Debbie]
Dope, dope, dope, dope boy magic
I start that shit out, it's all in the wrist got a dope boy magic
White on the scale, watch it come back a brick, dope boy magic
I ship it and pack it, I wrap it in plastic, dope boy magic
Dope boy magic, dope boy magic
Got the pots and the pans, make it stretch like elastic, dope boy magic
Goddamn, I need that thang, dope boy magic
Niggas wanna know how I did that, dope boy magic
Turned a quarter to a half, that's good glass

[Bricc Baby]
These niggas swear that they dope boys
Bricc Baby real fucking dope boy
Bankroll, bankroll, bankroll
Yeah I got a bankroll for selling dope, boy
I'ma pull up in a fucking Rolls Royce
I'ma snatch bread like a poor boy
