[Intro: Lil Debbie]
Just tell me baby
Just tell me baby
All you gotta do is tell me baby
All you gotta do is tell me baby

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
I been lookin' for the real thang, is you ready, is you ready?
If I tell you that I'm ready for the real, what's the deal? how you feel? would you tell me? would you tell me?
Baby you're the only one who stood out
Out of all the motherfuckers tryna get me
But I ain't got time for the bullshit
Fuck a hundred, I'ma keep a hundred fifty
Cause I been on my playa shit but I'm tired of wastin' my time
And you be moving like bosses do and your grind is matching my grind
Your energy and our chemistry is like the perfect beat to my rhyme
Ain't turned off by my shine, can't get you off of my mind
Enough with the talk, let's get it poppin'
Tired of the games, wanna be the only option
I ain't really trippin' 'bout your past, it's the past, let it go
Take charge, get my ass in the streets, let 'em know
That it's your shit

[Pre-Hook: Lil Debbie]
Down for whatever, that's your chick
Lady in the streets, in the sheets be a ho chick
Baby you's a hundred, gettin' blunted
And you can have it all if you with it, do you want it?
Just tell me baby

[Hook: Njomza]
Tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Just tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Just tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
I would like to get to know ya
If you tell me I could show ya
Guarantee it's nothin' better
Boy we're fly when we're together
If you let me I'll upgrade ya
Everything I do is major
I ain't never gonna play ya
These haters gonna hate us
Tell me baby
Because I'm tired of this waiting
When it comes to sexual relations
Real shit, ain't no imitations
I'll break you off
I'll break you off somethin' proper
Just hold me down and I got you
We hit the town and they plottin', watch us
I ain't never scared to ride though
Stay down, be the Bonnie to your Clyde though
Making moves, I won't ever leave your side though
You the only one I'm down to ride or die for
I ain't never give a damn, let them hoes talk
And you know I got your back if the heat come
All you gotta do is vow to keep it real with me
Take the good with the bad, still deal with me
Tell me baby

[Bridge: Njomza]
We could be a dream
Don't wake me up
Yeah we could be a dream
Don't wake me up

[Hook: Njomza]
Tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Just tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Just tell me baby, tell me baby, tell me baby
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
Don't keep me guessing
