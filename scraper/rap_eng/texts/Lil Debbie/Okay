[Verse 1]
I could spot'chu you phony bitches from a mile away
Bitch, I run a game, a hunnid miles a day
Bitches see me so they try to take this style away
There ain't nothin' you can do but bow your heads and pray
Bow your heads and pray, bow your heads and pray
What'chu sayin', think I'm playin' and there's hell to pay
Bow your heads and pray, bow your heads and pray
See me movin', bitch you losin', hoe, I'm 'bout to say
Fuck your conversation, we ain't fuckin' wit'chu suckers
All my bitches savage, I'm a ruley motherfucker
Bitch, you know I got it, back it up and pop-pop-pop it
Never stressin' 'bout these bitches
Most these hoes be outta pocket
So, okay

There they go
Bitches shut it down, that's everywhere we go

[Verse 3]
I'm on a hell of a run
Debbie too real, but as real as they come
No need for playin', I already won
But I'm back and I bullshit, I kill 'em for fun
I don't want love, I just want the respect
Fuck your approval, just cut me my check
Six or seven digits bigger, bitch and I'm set
Gettin' richer by the minute, it's gettin' me wet (wet, wet)
'Bout to fatten' up the bank roll
Lil' bitch better lay low (lay low)
Couple shooters on the payroll
And they move when I say so (say so)
Smokin' good from the Bay, hoe
Poppin' bottles by the case-load (case-load)
Live your life, bitch, you pay for
Life's great, feelin' grateful (grateful, grateful)

[Refrain]
They speakin' my name (they speakin' my name)
We smokin' that loud (we smokin' that loud)
We ain't comin' down (we ain't comin' down)
