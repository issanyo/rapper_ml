[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Hundred bands for a kilo nigga

[Verse 1]
I ain't never been no cookie cutter
Type of bitch been a blood sucker
Staying high than a motherfucker
Live directly from the gutter, gutter
Did I fucking stutter when I said I run it
Go and get it when they say they want it
Bitches talking like they got the [?]
But we eating [?], they could barely stomach
They don't really want it
Back in this bitch with my wrecking crew
Cut me a cheque or I'm checking you
Trust me don't fuck with my revenue
Snakes be lurking, I just mow 'em down
City love me cause I hold 'em down
Bitches speaking on me like they know me
They don't really know me, you could know me
Try and slow me down

[Chorus]
Cause I been on the road
Bitches been in a hold
You know it's business as usual
That's just the way that I roll (way that I roll)
Bitches can't handle the wheel (handle the wheel)
That's just why I'm taking control (taking control)
I'm always making a move (making a move)
'Cept when I'm taking a pose (cept when I'm taking a pose)
You know that I been on the road
You bitches been in a hold

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm the star of the show, I know I'm playing my role
Playing the hand I was given, I know they praying I fall
They know I'm slaying, for sure
I'm like the realest they know (realest they know)
Motivation money got me wilin'
Jet setting to a private island
Yacht swerving, we be island hopping
Throwing stacks at 'em so they know we popping
It's the only option when you fly as us
Tell the competition come and try ya luck
Bitches thinking they as high as us
Wasn't high enough and we be high as fuck

[Chorus]
And I been on the road
You bitches been in a hold
You know it's business as usual
That's just the way that I roll
Bitches can't handle the wheel
That's just why I'm taking control
I'm always making a move
'Cept when I'm taking a pose

[Verse 3]
They don't love us, they just say they love us
Claim they hard, soft as baby covers
Never ever give a bitch a pass, cause that be the day that they above us
And it's never that, took some losses I could weather that
But when it comes to taking nothing and making something, couldn't find some bitches better
Run and tell 'em that, ain't no scaling back
Find me a bitch that can talk, find me a bitch that can stop
I go this shit on my own, got a right to be cocky
I got this shit in the bag, you bitches just doing bad
You tryin' to fill up the tank, we I'm tryna fill up the bank

[Chorus]
And I been on the road (been on the road)
You bitches been in a hold (been in a hold)
You know it's business as usual
That's just the way that I roll (that's just the way that I roll)
Bitches can't handle the wheel (handle the wheel)
That's just why I'm taking control (taking control)
I'm always making a move (I'm always making a move)
'Cept when I'm taking a pose (cept when I'm taking a pose)
You know I been on the road (been on the road)
You bitches been in a hold (been in a hold)
Bitch I'm the star of the show (star of the show)
I know I'm playing my role (playing my role)
Playing the hand I was given (hand I was given)
I know they praying I fall (praying I fall)
They know I'm slaying, for sure (slaying for sure)
I'm like the realest they know (realest they know)

[Outro]
Realest they know, realest they know
Realest they know, realest they know
