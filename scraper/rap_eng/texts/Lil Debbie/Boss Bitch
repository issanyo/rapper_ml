[Intro]
Boss bitches throw it up
Boss bitches throw it up

[Hook]
Boss bitches throw it up
Hit the floor and tear it up
Boss bitches throw it up
Hit the floor and tear it up

[Verse 1]
All my bitches bad, I got a pocket full of money
If you talkin' gettin' lit then I'm the socket for you dummies
Bitch, I be the plug in the light switch
Bitches applause for the right bitch
[?]
I ain't heard a word, I ain't seen a thang
Stackin' up the chips, I don't need a ring
Hoe, lift the trophy when it's said and done
Boss bitch, realest that you ever seen
I'ma go schyzo
Work the ass, bounce bounce when I dip low
I'm the shit [?]
I been blowin', sit back, kick back
Bitch, I'm really with the shits though

[Hook]
Boss bitches throw it up
Hit the floor and tear it up
Boss bitches throw it up
Hit the floor and tear it up

[Verse 2]
Uh, so don't talk to me
Bitch, I'm bad [?]
I'm a bossy [?]
Count six figure stacks and it's all for me
These hoes need to fall back
Talkin' loud in my area
Big dog like a pit bull
These hoes really tearin' ya
I ain't really worried 'bout your little bite
[?]
I'ma go schyzo
Work the ass, bounce bounce when I dip low
You can see a bitch on and off all night
I sip light, smoke fly, pimp dance
'Cause I'm really 'bout the boss life
