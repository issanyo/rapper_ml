[Verse 1]
Look at them internet trolls straight hurtin'
YouTube searchin', Instagram lurkin'
Debbie's what's trendin' so they eyes stay workin'
Steady on my job so the haters stay certain
Bitches watchin' me, I'm just watchin' my money
'Cause internet poppin's like Monopoly money
If I left it up to y'all I woulda quit this shit
And that's what's showin' me that I'm just fuckin' with dummies
So, click click, hate that, double tap
I'm too busy on the grind, couple stacks, double that
Not a hater on my mind, though
I shine, hoe, I'ma fuck around and blind hoes, besides, hoes
You bitches can never see me
The way I kill 'em they tellin' me take it easy
And all the bitches that hated, wish you could be me
I had to show and make these bitches believe me
I'm runnin' this shit like damn

[Hook]
Every time I drop my new shit it's like damn
Debbie pullin' up, my new whip is like damn
Roll another gram I'm too lit like damn
Sold out shows that's another couple grand
Every time I rock a new fit it's like damn
Blunts fatter than a pool stick like damn
Hater bitches get a full clip like damn
Been killin' bitches, I'm 'bout to do it again

[Verse 2]
Look at these phony ass hoes I'm facin'
Congratulate 'em, side line hatin'
Bitches gettin' sour 'bout the moves I'm makin'
I ain't slowin' down, bitch I'm in it for the takin'
I'm the queen, hoe, so what you mean, hoe?
Don't come around, you wasn't fuckin' with the team, hoe
Don't come around 'cause you can see I'm fuckin' rich now
And the rap game is fuckin' with a bitch now
Look at me, right in the position that I need to be luckily
Fuck with me, find out why the streets got love for me
Cover me, find out why these bitches still rough with me
Rollin' up a blunt, live that boss life comfortably
Damn li'l bitch I'm just tryna do me
Hundred grand last year I'm just tryna move three
Bitches takin' L's, I just roll that ooh wee
Laughin' at my competition, motivation to me I'm like damn

[Hook]
Every time I drop my new shit it's like damn
Debbie pullin' up, my new whip is like damn
Roll another gram I'm too lit like damn
Sold out shows that's another couple grand
Every time I rock a new fit it's like damn
Blunts fatter than a pool stick like damn
Hater bitches get a full clip like damn
Been killin' bitches, I'm 'bout to do it again

[Outro]
Damn, god damn
(Damn, li'l bitch, stay off me, bitch)
