[Verse 1: Bok Nero]
Yellow Claw just hit my line
So let's get this fucking money
When I start, keep it coming
I like hundreds, I like twenties
Got a bitch that look like Chun-li
And her pussy taste like honey
I lay pipe just like a plumber
She can feel it in her tummy
Like my women, like my cars
Auto foreign, auto foreign
She ain't flexible at all
Guess she boring, guess she boring
That say Polo on my boxers
That's Ralph Lauren, that's Ralph Lauren
Hit it then that paper chasing
Where you going? Yeah, I'm going, waah
Everything I ever do, know I do it to the max
I don't tell no lie to you
It's the truth, it's a fact
All I know is hustle hard
Make a flip, bring it back
You know all my money dirty
All I know is trap-trap-trap

[Chorus: Lil Debbie]
All about that boom-boom-boom
Don't exhaust go vroom (vroom)
All about that ching-ching-ching
Make the rest go bling (bling)
All about that bam-bam-bam
Pouring gas in my blunt (blunt)
All about that green-green-green
Bitch, I flex so mean

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Yellow Claw just hit my blunt
They know all my shit is fire
If you need it, what you want?
Got that flame I'm the supplier
If your goal is getting higher
I'm that bitch, just hit my line
Cashed a hundred grand in dubs
No time to pay these hoes, no mind
Swear to God, Debbie doing just fine
A lot of new money from my hands these days
Silly bitch never getting a dime
'Cause I'll be out of reach off of land these days
But my grind don't lag from the jetlag
And the ink ain't dried on my passport
Put it on for the town, you can bet that
Got the city on my back like a Jansport
Everything I ever do, just know I do it to the max
Like to double up my sex, if I go in and take 'em back
And I'm known to turn it out, I'm talking everywhere I'm at
Bitch, I made it out the hood and we ain't going back to that

[Chorus: Lil Debbie]
All about that boom-boom-boom
Don't exhaust go vroom (vroom)
All about that ching-ching-ching
Make the rest go bling (bling)
All about that bam-bam-bam
Pouring gas in my blunt (blunt)
All about that green-green-green
Bitch, I flex so mean

[Verse 3: MC Gustta]
Vai, gostosa, vai, danada
Mexe a bunda, mexe a raba
Mostra toda a sua pegada
Vai, não para, não para
Tá terrível, tá treinada
Na minha cama tu é braba
Eu na pose de quebrada
Ela joga na cara, vai
Movimento gostoso, ela quica pro pai
Senta que senta gostoso demais
Ela mostra pras mina como é que se faz
Vai, vai, vai, vai
Ela sabe que os cara não captam a dor
Ela quer se envolver com nós na vida boa
Se quer se envolver tem que se doar toda
É só bunda que mexe, é só nave que voa

[Chorus: Lil Debbie]
All about that boom-boom-boom
Don't exhaust go vroom (vroom)
All about that ching-ching-ching
Make the rest go bling (bling)
All about that bam-bam-bam
Pouring gas in my blunt (blunt)
All about that green-green-green
Bitch, I flex so mean

[Verse 4: MC Kekel]
Porque hoje deixa ela chegar
Que ela quer dançar, quer se acabar
Admiro ela rebolando
Ela tá dançando, todo mundo quer olhar
Mas que popozão, desce até o chão
Eu hoje mirei na morena
Ela gosta desse negão
Eu sei que ela quer dançar
Que ela quer beber, vai se acabar
Tô pedindo pra esse DJ soltar o som pra ela rebolar
Deixa ela dançar
She knows I'm in love to no one
I love your bumbum

[Chorus: Lil Debbie]
All about that boom-boom-boom
Don't exhaust go vroom (vroom)
All about that ching-ching-ching
Make the rest go bling (bling)
All about that bam-bam-bam
Pouring gas in my blunt (blunt)
All about that green-green-green
Bitch, I flex so mean
