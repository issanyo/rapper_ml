Labels be so funny see that shit on the shelf, told em I don't need your money bitch I get it myself

I don't mean no harm I only deal what I felt, so when you stuck in your feelings just know I'm fucking with millions
Clocking in on the daily so when I'm rich I be chilling, only roll in the drop cuz I ain't fucking with ceilings

I been moving weight, work been going sturdy, you know all my circle straight, looking like 6:30, that's cuz all my nights are late, mornings hella early, that's why everybody clean, cuz I been getting dirty

I been rocking my position, bitches out here fronting, played the background for a minute, now it's time for stunting
So much food is on my plate, we been out here grubbing, promise all my family great, they don't want for nothing, nu-uh

They don't want for nothing, they don't want for nothing promise all my family great, they don't want for nothing, nu-uh, they don't want for nothing, they don't want for nothing

I been on my bullshit no I ain't nothing to fool with, If I said it then it's gospel like a preacher on the pulpit
I ain't big up on discussion I prefer to go and prove it
I just hustle bitch I hustle this shit way much more than music

Got my city going stupid, dumb retarded, when these bitches reach their limit, we just only getting started
Bow your head, close your eyes, for them bitches who departed Amen

Oh what you saying? You bitches wanna see me fall? Better get to praying, and we been in the kitchen cooking so you know we caking
And they ain't rooting for the underdog this shit amazing, I'm 'bout to give this shit my all yeah that's my motivation, yeah they my motivation

I been rocking my position, bitches out here fronting, played the background for a minute, now it's time for stunting
So much food is on my plate, we been out here grubbing, promise all my family great, they don't want for nothing, nu-uh
