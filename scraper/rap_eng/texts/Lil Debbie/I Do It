[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Lil Debbie, big shirt, you don't rock it like me
YSL all gold, everything on me
I'm from the Bay and we ridin' if the tank on E
Fat wallet, big cash, jumping jack, big tree

Gold hoops, gold rings
Stuntin' in that thang
Pull up in that wet red Range, that shit flame
Inside asylum white its insane!
Before I hop out on these bitches I let that shit wang

[Hook]
Lil Debbie, eat cash
I work it out, gym class
If we goin' out, I'm blowin' 10 racks
I ain't trippn off nothin' I'm tryna tell you I do it

[Verse 2: Kool John]
Yeah, yeah
Gold nuggets, gold frames, and some gold chains
I don't want you to be my main, I just want some brain
By every dollar I don't ever let 'em keep the change
Cause I'mma [?] like pop hit it with the bang

If the head nice, cool down everynight
Skinny sweats, Lebron 10s and some Plantlifes
Yeah we next up, I stay f'ed up, with a fresh cut, keep your bitch wet up
I love big checks, I love good sex
Rich the city got my back, made my hood next

Bout progress, bout paper
I'm the hot topic, you's a fuckin' hater
I'm not a savior, I'm not a waiter
Bad bitch got jaws like a gator
Smash like bam, hit it the wam
Like damn, catching [?] like spam

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie]
I'm Lil Debbie, cute as shit and I do it easy
My gold shine all the time so I know you see me
Bitches wanna be me your boyfriend need me
Purp 'n Sprite, got my whole team leanin'
Hair and nails done right, yeah a bitch steezin'

Retweetin' while I'm in important meetings
Boss shit, cause I'm a boss bitch
Get everything I want free it don't cost shit
I get it all, Celine to Chanel
Didn't know I had bars cause a bitch made bail

If you really gettin' money, then bitch I can't tell
I think its silly that you're frontin' when deep down you're frail
Seen your kind before but I could read you in Braille
Beat you with my eyes closed that's just how I feel
Check my numbers, Youtube out a mil, and I'm rollin' up kush on this $100 bill
