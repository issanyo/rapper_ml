[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Ay, life's getting crazy
What to do, what to do, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Problems all around
World is cruel, it's so cruel, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Searching for a feeling
Something true, something true, yeah (yeah, yeah)
I been on the vibe
Something new, something new, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Gather every nation, burn a peace pipe
Even through the night I can see the light
Tell me what it's gonna take till we break
Kill the hate, we're in war and I'ma lead the fight
Power, greed, the money, that's the root
We aloof, gun strong, hands up, don't shoot
What's the use to this?
I been looking at the world from a different scope
Realest shit I quote
Love and hope is the antidote

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
All we really need is a little bit of love
L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E!
All we really need is a little bit of love
L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love!

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
The power to breathe life and kill war
The power to end hate and feel more
The power to break the shackles and free 'em all
Open blind eyes to understand that we need more
'Cause we all been the victims of the vision
Like race, class, sex and religion, it's a prison
Leave the past behind and free your mind
Changing for the better, I can see the signs
My prayer to the one above
Ask him if he took it all could he leave us love
I promise that will be enough, i promise all we need is love
I been getting better [?] respect it baby
Had to get to work cuz it don't get no realer
Started in the mirror look at you
What i see, same as me,  now I'm free
Love is key, harmony

[Chorus: Stacy Barthe]
All we really need is a little bit of love
L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E!
All we really need is a little bit of love
L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love! L-O-V-E, love!
