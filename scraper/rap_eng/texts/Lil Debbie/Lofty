[Verse 1]
I'm done with eighths
I'm smoking pounds
That's pitcher mounds
That's murky clouds
You high or what
Cause I'm high as shit
Eyes blood-red just like DJ Quik
Who fuckin' with me?
Then blaze up fast
You bring the weed
I'mma twist it back
Who tryna smoke?
I said who tryna smoke?
Roll it up
That's my favorite quote

[Hook]
Who tryna get high in this motherfucker?
I'm tryna get you high in this motherfucker
Now let me get you high in this motherfucker
Now tell me if you high in this motherfucker
I'm high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
Aye, you high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck

[Verse 2]
One time I could straight fly
Lofty, I could touch sky
IQ about point five
Translation, dumb high
Shout out to that humble
Hit you fast, you seen both
Colt 45 my chaser
West Major Lazer
Hey Diplo, girl you bad, you dip low
Tryna lace my shit
Fuck that hell no
Just pass the smoke
Just pass the smoke
Puff puff pass, diddy-fied till you fuckin' choke

[Hook]
Who tryna get high in this motherfucker?
I'm tryna get you high in this motherfucker
Now let me get you high in this motherfucker
Now tell me if you high in this motherfucker
I'm high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
Aye, you high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck


[Bridge]
Roll it up, pour it up
Same time let's smoke it up
Roll it up, pour it up
Same time let's smoke it up
Roll it up, pour it up
Same time let's smoke it up
I'm high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
Aye, you high as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
High as fuck
