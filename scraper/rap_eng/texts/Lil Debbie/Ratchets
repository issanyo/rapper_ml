I got bitches, you got bitches
Tell them bitches come over
If they ratchet, let’s get ratchet
Pick ‘em up in that rover
I got ratchets in my living room ’til 6 in the morning
And when I finish up this weed, man I’m sending them home

I got bitches, you got bitches
Tell them bitches come over
If they ratchet, let’s get ratchet
Pick ‘em up in that rover
I got ratchets in my living room ’til 6 in the morning
And when I finish up this weed, man I’m sending them home

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
I got ratchets and some bitches
Coke lines, no soft drinks
Ben Franks, that green dank
Wet pussy, pink paint
Bitches in my crib, I got these ratchets in my mouse trap
I pulled up in that rover, that dark tint, all black
Yep, I got them saying "Debbie, you the fucking baddest"
Cuz I be smoking on that kush'n like a fucking mattress
We could link up codeine cups, bitch drink up
We turned like tea cups, cold sprite, syrup
Boss bitch and my whip clean, eyelashes on point, ho!
The Jordan chains go Michael, free throws my eyes closed
Little Debbie, swagging out, I'm laced out, what you talking 'bout?
Gold chain it might save your life
I'm leaned out when I'm walking out
Leaned out when I'm walking out (x2)
Gold chain it might save your life
I'm leaned out when I'm walking out
Leaned out when I'm walking out (x2)
Gold chain it might save your life
I'm leaned out when I'm walking out

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
I got some sprite, I got some codeine
You fucked up off no drinks?
White reefer, fly sneakers, tint glasses out giant big
Hate me 'cuz i love that
Get high with these ratchet bitches
I got that range rover
Dark tint, I might add some switches
That means I'm balling and these ratchets fronting like they know me
Only if I had a dick yo they could fucking blow me
And everything I want I cop it like the fucking police
I'm faded like I'm Kobe, weed, I smoke it by the OZ's
They in my function and they smoking all of my weed
And I ain't tripping off these hoes, I pop another molly
Don't you wish you had this green up all in my safari
They talking lip, I turn these ratchets into Calamari
