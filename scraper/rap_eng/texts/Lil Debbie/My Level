[Intro]
Bitches actin' like we owe 'em some'n
We like: "Yeah, bitch, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Talkin' Debbie, let me hold some'n
I'd rather th'ow in the ai-ai-air
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work, make it work
Make it work forward, make it work forward
Make it work, make it work, make it work forward

[Verse 1]
You need bad bitches, what it do?
My team on, got 'em fuckin' with the crew
They ain't signed bitches, nothin' new
Hoes actin' like it happened outta blue
I got the goods, bitches, what you want?
Show-stopper, hit the club, turn it up
I'm the back-it-up on you, make a bounce, chick
Fuck a gram, I'ma get it by the ounce
Now you know they lookin' at it, better keep them paws off
I just break 'em off, do it better with my drawers off
Shit is gettin' hot now, better turn the fans down
Pass me a Swisher, I'ma roll the shit and burn it down
Turn up!

[Hook]
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, that's you and whoever want it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, that's you and whoever want it

[Verse 2]
I'm the boss, bitches, what are you, bitches?
Queen, shit, there ain't nothin' you could with this
Fuck with true bitches, just a few bitches
Circle small, we ain't fuckin' with you new bitches
What'cha styllin' on? We the best at it
We ain't nothin' like you bitches, super fresh at it
Gettin' better by the minute with this rap shit
Who win the ass, gets a work and is a rap bitch
Now I got them [?], you know they watchin', hoe
I just hit the function, turn it out and get it poppin'
Work, work, work
I just flip it and reverse it
Picture perfect, th'owin' hunnids
I deserve it, bitch, I'm worth it, tell 'em

[Hook]
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, that's you and whoever want it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it
I tell 'em: "Get on my level, ain't none of you bitches on it"
Get on my level, that's you and whoever want it

[Outro]
Bitches actin' like we owe 'em some'n
We like: "Yeah, bitch, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Talkin' Debbie, let me hold some'n
I'd rather th'ow in the ai-ai-air
Make it work, make it work
Make it work, make it work, make it work
Make it work forward, make it work forward
Make it work, make it work, make it work forward
