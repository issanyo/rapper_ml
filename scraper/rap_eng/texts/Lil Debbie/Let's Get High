What the fuck do you want?
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

[Verse 1]
Wake up, bake up, just got a pound, get your weight up
Wait up, hold up, stay turnt up, finna burn up
Broke a gram down, bitch turnt up
Cause I be full of Swishers when I roll up
Two blunts, full price, 'bout to go up
Living every day like its 4/20, smoke up
Bitch I've been toking, I smoke like a pro
Got love in these streets, get my shit for the low
My connect is your connects, connects, I'm connected
My blunt hittin' art, my every breathe is perfected, now bitch
Burn a muthafuckin' house down, got my shit from Humboldt
Took us out back, four plus, three bitches, two bottle, one flame, it's a count down

[Bridge]
OG Kush, now that's my shit
Girl Scout Cookie, that's my shit
Bubba got me zonin' to the mornin', took a dab
That's it, I'm high, I'm high
I'm high, you know I'm high
(What the fuck do you want?
You Guys wanna buy some chronic?)

[Verse 2]
Don't come around unless you bout that life
Burn more trees than forest fires
Only bad bitches smoke my fire, broke ass hoes get no replies
I keep my circles small, keep my blunts fat
Keep my weed potent, blew like three bags

Heavy weight, hit for hit, blow for blow, toe to toe
I smoke with the best cause i'm high
So wannabe, fuck all your question, and live how I wanna live
Do what I wanna, Got my own option so fuck all the rest of 'em all, bitch
Like yolo, blew an eight down solo dolo
Bout to roll another one, smoke like a marathon
Bitch burn 'em down-down, all my weed is hella bomb
