[Intro]
Yung Felix

[Verse 1]
I got 99 problems in this bitch now
Money ain't an issue 'cause we rich now
Gotta bunch of new bitches on my shit now
Ain't it funny how these hatin' bitches switch now
I ain't trippin' on you bitches on the side line
All these ugly mothefuckers on my timeline
Made something out of nothing while these bitches frontin'
Blew a grand from pitching on the hot times
Baby, I can be your motivation, behind your business
Ain't no hustle then it's no relatin', crime for instance
If it gets you, so we know we kick it, yeah, we kick it
All we're doin' ain't no overstatin', ain't no fakin'
Keep my dollars circulatin' like a ceiling fan
I done shitted on you bitches and you're still a fan
And this ass top a saddle, I could kill a man
Sold out shows on you hoes 'cause I'm in demand
Like that? That? Like that?

[Hook]
(Woohoo)
I could work with that
I drop it low then I flip it
Yeah, I'm workin' that, you digg?
I can work with that
Turned a gram to a grand
I can flirt with that, you digg?
I can work with that
If I throw the thang on you
Then I'm hurtin' that, you digg?
I can work with that
Yeah, I can work with that

[Verse 2]
Hoe I work that shit like a 9-to-5
Throw it back on his lap so it's on a rise
If it ain't about the money then it's no replies
Only kushy on the paper so you know we high
Bitches started with a dream, made a meal ticket
Me and my day-one bitches, yeah, we still kick it
When you poppin' bitches hatin', yeah, they feel with it
I ain't worried 'bout the drama, bitch, you deal with it
But when I come around I can hear you whisper
Pussy made, I'm just looking for your whiskers (uhh)
Where them bitches tryna diss us
I got the game wrapped up, Christmas
Blowin' kush, clouds comin' out the window
Should be knockin' bitches out, call it Kimbo
From the windows to the wall
I'm poppin' bottles 'til they yell last call
You know, you know

[Hook]
(Woohoo)
I could work with that
I've drop it low then I flip it
Yeah, I'm workin' that, you digg
I can work with that
Turned a gram to a grand
I can flirt with that, you digg
I can work with that
If I throw the thang on you
Then I'm hurtin' that, you digg
I can work with that
Yeah, I can work with that
