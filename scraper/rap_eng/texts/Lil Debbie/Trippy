[Intro]
Trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy
Trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy

[Verse 1]
Bitches hate to see me don't know why
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't flattered by their feelings
Couldn't even give a fuck, that's if I tried
You know I've been on the road getting closer to a million
Bitches tryna shoot me down, I'm too fly
Just some crabs in a bucket, you know how that saying goes
I'm just rolling up another, let's get high
Cause I be getting high, just to even out my lows

[Verse 2]
V-12 engine you can tell we winning
Bitch I'm bout to stretch my money out like the seventh thinning
See so many bitches tryna be me, you can say we twinning
You know that everything I do is trending and my Benz is jammin'
Now they in 'em, I just took their venom and turned it to motivation
So in front of all these bitches, I ain't know we racing
Off that Northern Californian, blowing like Jamaica
So if you say you got that fire, then I got that Satan

[Chorus]
We be blowing like the hippies, yeah we trippy
Another round, all around, got the Henny, tipsy
It's going down, going down, getting litty with it
I ease my mind, I'm too busy staying trippy, trippy
Oh yeah I'm trippy, trippy
Trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy
Oh yeah we trippy, trippy
Trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy

[Verse 3]
If a stupid motherfucker try to stop it
Try to derail my profit, I promise I'm 'bout to cock it
Bitches claiming outta pocket, take the loud outta ya socket
Ain't claiming to be a killer, I told my bitches I got them
So now I feel like I owe 'em
Started with some bitches, now it feel like I don't know 'em
That feeling when you outgrow 'em, I told 'em ain't gotta show 'em now
I can lead them to the water, I can show 'em how
To drink I think these bitches want me slowing down
Loud white bitch and you ain't about to tone me down
You ain't ever gonna see me, you still know we round
I just rolled another blunt, so bitch let's blow it down
Oh yeah, let's blow it down
Trippy, trippy
