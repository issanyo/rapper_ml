[Hook]
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate

[Verse 1]
Bomb, that bomb
Yeah, I'm always smokin' that bomb
Gettin' money, real long
I'm always gettin' chased by King Kong
I'm that bitch he on
He likin' on me, he wanna wife me
I'm hella icy, we hella saucy
We hella bossy, what it cost me?
Please, who's lookin' at tags these days?
I heard you went broke, you a charity case
What you're layin' next to can't compare to this face
Can't walk in my shoes, can't stand in my space
Bitch, I'm a one of one, you a dime a dozen
Don't call me if it ain't about the money
I'ma get it if I motherfuckin' want it
Pull the credit card out, tell 'em run it

[Hook]
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate

[Verse 2]
Stylin', profilin'
Everybody in the clique be wildin'
Umbrellas in my drink on an island
All you beat up hoes, throw the towel in
Money just pilin'
Hella shows across the country
Slim waist but always hungry
Is that why you say you want me?
'Cause I'm gettin' that cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Tell me put it in his face, face, face, face, face
He be, he be goin' cray, cray, cray, cray, cray
Yeah, we do this every day, day, day, day, day
Tell 'em run it

[Hook]
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate

[Verse 3]
Chanel slippers, male strippers
I don't fuck with it, I like thug shit
He get rough with me, I get rough back
I got him stuck to my walls like a thumbtack
Done tacked, in my car
Windows up, my pockets fat
I ain't gotta prove I can rap
I'm that bitch that he askin' 'bout, yup
Lil D
Love from the nerds and the triple OGs
Need about a OZ, rollin' with the whole team
Red cup full of heem, I'm your man's wet dream
That cream, that money
I'ma get it if I motherfuckin' want it
I admit it, I'm addicted to the stuntin'
Pull the credit card out, tell 'em run it

[Hook]
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate
I'm that bitch, that bitch, that bitch
That bitch, that bitch, that bitch, don't hate, don't hate
