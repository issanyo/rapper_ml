By the time you hear this
You can tell a thang
Tell the weatherman to focus
Let it rain

I do my thang (thang)
I do my thang (thang)
I do my thang (thang)

Right, cash rules everything
That's why Debbie is all abou the ? man

I do my thang
I do my thang
I do my thang
I do my thang

Do your thang
Do your thang
Do your thang

In the club pouring up, like I don't give a fuck
Never don't, never did tho
Motherfuckers try and judge let me live hoe
