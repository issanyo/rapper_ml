[Intro]
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Never really been the same since I came though
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Name, name, name, name, name, name

[Chorus]
Never really been the same since I came though
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe

[Verse 1]
Lil Becky with the good ass
Still trapping in the kitchen, yeah, I'm good at that
That's a seven figure stack, it's been a good year
That's like seven hundred horses in my head there, yeah
Pedal to the floor, shit, that's how I roll
Never hit the breaks, never lose control
Bitch, I turn it up when I put it down
Handle shit to work, you know it's a go go campy
Bitches tryna play me
Spit that shit just like a
It's a western, ain't not safety
Bitch, bang, watch I'm doing my thing
Switching lanes with the gang
Who the queen? Say my name

[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Never really been the same since I came though
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Say my name, say my name, say my name
Name, name, name, name, name, name
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
Say my name, say my name, say my name hoe
