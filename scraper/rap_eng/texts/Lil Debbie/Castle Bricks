[Intro]
Cocaina, Cuba, Colombia, Peru

[Hook]
The princess told you no deal if I don't know you
I'm 'bout to make another trip for what?
Flip, flip
Talkin' 'bout them castle bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Castle bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Ca-ca-castle bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Castle bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks, bricks)

[Verse 1]
Bricks, bricks, bricks so exciting to me
Bricks, bricks, bricks, they are whiter than me
Thirty six six sound right for the key
Got 'em off the ship sail right from the sea
It's a party going on it's like four in the morning
In a millionaire's home he be calling and calling
Man I'm already coming, engine already running
They can feel the rush coming, yeah, they already numbing
This that Hannah Montana fasho
This that Lindsay Lohan, that blow
This that Hilary D, it's that Hilary Duff
Yeah, I'm even Britney stoned
This that Mary-Kate, Ashley yo
So many bricks that I got for the low
You got the money I'm letting it go
Plenty snow bunnies, yeah, I got the flow
And I'm letting you know, yo

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You want that Keira Knightley, nightly?
You been up with Chelsea Lately, lately?
It's something 'bout that girl that excite me
Hillary Swank whippin' that million dollar baby, baby, baby
Duckin' the Duke Tracy, pitchin' Warren Beatty
I got that Jack Nicholson, you should come and pay me
Like the Cocaine Cowboys gettin' in the 80's
Clint Eastwood, servin' that Slim Shady
Whippin' that, whippin' that Vanilla Ice
That is my Miami vice, hoppin' out drippin in ice
Fuck what you heard, I'm flippin' these birds
And I'm never droppin' my price
Honestly, that's being nice
Just call you wanna get right
For sure I got that white
I'm so raw that I could do life, but not in this life though

[Hook]
