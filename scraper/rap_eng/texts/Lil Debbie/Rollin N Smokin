[Intro]
DJ Swish
Swish on the beat so you know this shit pumping

[Verse 1]
Bitch I’m a boss west side representing
Blowing on the best two grams in this swisher
Only bad bitches fall deep in the coop
Got my shit on loop
Smokin tree like snoop

Bitch we blowing, blowing, blowing
Blowing blowing, blowing
Two fattys got and I’m going, going, going, going
And I’m all work turnt up feeling how I wanna
Blowing on that northern california marijuana

Hoe I’m so shaded
Turnt up my team just to show you that we made it
Bitches will kill for these trees that we tasted
I smoke up and chill this that time that we wasted, god damn
How the hell we still gettin money
Don’t mind the smell that’s the kill coming for me
Stop that another one, i’m switching four lanes
With the top down screaming down money ain't a thing
We just rollin and blowin
Smokin on the finest you ain’t know them
We just rollin, stoning, smoking till my eyes barely opened
We just rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin
We just smokin and chillin
Mother fucker about to make a killer

[Bricc Baby Verse]
I'm from LA but i ride it like a skater
Me and Debbie chop it chop it get a paper
My chunky got 31 flavors and you niggas
Use to ball like the lakers look I flip the
Pack and get it out of here, sippin on that
Red and yellow like the colour lit if a nigga
Disrespect make them disappear put the
Beam on his back hit him in the head
But it’s funny how you thought I was playing
Nigga you is the best call it what you want
Nigga switch team for all my rida niggas
Switch team never fuck with a rida nigga
And I’m from Roden I’m from Roden
Trying to be a stunner you a stoner
Stoner come get your bitch cause she ugly
Number one she say she want to ride the
Dick like a roller coaster

[Hook]
So we rollin and blowin
Smokin on the finest you don’t know them
We just rollin stoning smoking too much
Till my eyes barely opened we just rollin
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin
We just smokin and chillin mother fucker
About to make a kill

[Verse 3]
Catch me at the shop baddest bitch you ever
Saw 3 row of blow and we about to blow them
Out flexing with no flow bad bitches no joke
Turning up slow while we waving middle finger
Blowing blowing blowing blowing blowing and
We still rollin rollin rollin rollin I smoke like a
Pope cause I get it for the low and I’m about
To roll it up got a kush in the high and I stay
As high as I want to like that couple pounds
Got me feeling like a treat it’s like that and
You know it’s just like that when I say blow it
Back 320 from me like that smoking like a
Chimney death to my enemies shit and
Phony hoes and everything that you
Pretending to be bitch don’t blow my high
