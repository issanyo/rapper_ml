[Intro: Starrah]
Add up my check

[Hook: Starrah]
Add up my check like the fuck I'ma cop?
Post on your block with the whoop like the cops
Run up the true and I light up your block
Pump down your strip with the whoop like the cops
(Whoop-whoop-whoop)
I hit the strip with that whoop, ice on my wrist, it go whoop
Clothes [?] like whoop, whoop, I got that
I hit the strip with that whoop, ice on my wrist, it go whoop
Clothes [?] like whoop, post on your strip with that whoop
Whoop like the cops

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Bitch, I'm a boss, bitch, I'm a boss
You are not close to my level, don't ask what it costs
That's why I floss
Show these new bitches I stay on my business
I cop that new coupe
Doin' and 100, oh yeah, bitch, I gun it
The cops be like whoop-whoop-whoop
Uh, I woke up feelin' like a million dollars
Yeah, I need that
Just like bitches, blunts, and double cups
Hoe, fuck your feedback
Only bossy bitches in my circle, you know how we roll
Bitches throw a shade around my way gon' make me react
If I said it, I live it
If I want it, I get it
If I roll it, I lit it
When you hit it, it's different
You dig it?
I'ma go big like everyday
So get the fuck up out my way, hoe
Killin' these hoes like every way
From the bay down to L.A., hoe
We at it

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Showin' up with a bitch like whoop
Tree rolled up like whoop
Ass in the face like whoop
Bitch fold up like whoop
My shit back so it stays on loop
Flows on tap and the haze on you
I don't need beep cause the bitch too cute
But the team stay down, talk shit they shoot, shit
Fuck around and get hurt
Turn this up and get murk'd
Ride around with that work
100 grand in my purse
Been digged dirt but a bitch cleaned up
Cup full of Sprite and that shit leaned up
Got a little buzz and you think y'all on
But you better reconsider when your team sees us, trust
Someone better tell 'em 'fore I have to go and show 'em
Who the baddest in this bitch? Yeah I'm the highest on the totem
I done smoked about a zone, I guess it's safe to say I'm zonin'
Got my head up in the clouds and we ain't landin' till the mornin', shit
I'm so far gone, I'm laughin' hoes
So far ahead of these rappin' hoes
Internet trolls, no action hoes
I'ma go big bout every day
So give a fuck bout what you say, hoe
Shittin' on hoes like every way, run the Bay down to L.A., hoe
