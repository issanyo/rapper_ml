[Intro]
Kid Classic
Noisy
Ay, check me out, check me out, check me out, ah

[Verse 1]
Debbie be the rapper (rapper, rapper)
Class be the producer (producer, producer)
And we ain't ever worried about an issue, why
He done droppin' shit to shoot ya
Everything tastes super
Super good smoke and the ruler to the tutor
If you wanna be the ruler, then you bitches gotta come and see the boss, King Koopa
Bitch I been a boss, get my stashies
Fuck the freeway, take the back street (back street)
I be getting head in the back seat (back seat)
Running up my bread like a track meet (track meet)
We and my team trying be rich (be rich)
You and yo team tryna seem rich (seem rich)
Debbie been the girl, I don't been a bowl
I been on the wave so long, gotten sea sick

[Chorus]
All I ever know is to get it, get it go
Get it, got it, get some mo
We ain't with it, if it's slow, oh, no, no, no
Watch us flip it then it grow
We been buildin' from the floor
I go hard at any hoe, oh
All I ever know is to get it, get it go
Get it, got it, get some mo
We ain't with it, if it's slow, oh, no, no, no
Watch us flip it then it grow
We been buildin' from the floor
I go hard at any hoe, oh

[Interlude]
Get to killing bitches, what the business is

[Verse 2]
Class the producer (producer)
And Debbie the rapper (rapper)
Bitches be mad my life like a movie and they just an actor (actor)
Oscar to the nominees to the wannabes
Day I'm out of style is the day you find me out of tree
