[Verse 1]
Yo, gimme a thot and I bet I sell you a dream
Pass me the rock and I bet I carry the team
Gimme a beat and I bet I carry the flow
Show me a hater and watch me burry the hoe
Who wouldn't knew the white bitch from the hood
Was start to crackin' this rappin' and get to livin' this good
Ev'ything I'm wearin' is custom
I can even get my tree up in customs
That's overseas for the dumb hoes
But I'm still in the city goin' dumb, hoe
The golden state, there ain't no escape
If you ain't about tha dolla bill then we don't relate
No fake shit, I been trill
Queen got the city rollin' with me, so you know the deal
No chill 'cause I'm dumb real
Been killin' bitches bout to put my shit in overkill

[Hook]
Shittin' on hoes when I wake up
Mo' money, no pay cuts
Rollin' my tree, get your bake up
It's all good 'cause my cake up
Bitch, I got my cake up, I got my cake up
I got my cake up, I got my cake up
Bitch, I got my cake up, I got my cake up
I got my cake up, I got my cake up

[Verse 2]
Yo, fat pockets with a fat ass
Got my hands dirty, comin' up, I never had a pass
Not a thing given so I'm on a take
Why you think they call me Lil Debbie, 'cause I work the cake
I just whip it, yeah, I whip it good
Lookin', I don't see the competition so it's understood
I'm too busy, stayin' busy
Tryna pave my own lane, word to Nicki and Iggy
Ain't no lookin' down when you wear the crown
Money ain't the issue there's enough of that to go around
Started from the bottom, now I got it
Five figures for a show, not a problem
Light work 'cause I'm comin' for a million
I got work and you fuckin' with a real one
I'm everythang phony bitches ain't
Watch me on the rise, guarantee I'm 'bout to break the bank

[Hook]
Shittin' on hoes when I wake up
Mo' money, no pay cuts
Rollin' my tree, get your bake up
It's all good 'cause my cake up
Bitch, I got my cake up, I got my cake up
I got my cake up, I got my cake up
Bitch, I got my cake up, I got my cake up
I got my cake up, I got my cake up
