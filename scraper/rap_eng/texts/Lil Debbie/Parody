Debbie
Bumpin' that Boosie and Webbie
Most of you bitches look scared of me
Clearly, I'm laughin' at bitches like parodies
Laughin' at bitches like parodies
Laughin' at bitches like parodies
Real bitches fuck with me heavily
All of you fake bitches, shit on you steadily, uh

[Verse 1]
Same bitch, on my Bay shit
Same shit, never did, never take shit
Real bitch, never change it
Trill shit, take it back to the basics
Real flows, real hoes
Kill those weirdos
Out in LA of Kreayshawn
They bounce to my shit like 6 4S, uh
Bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce for a real bitch
And all I know is kill, kill, kill
Kill hoes, kill shows while I'm smokin' on that kill shit
R.I.P, all I see
Run the game, can't ball like me
V.I.P, all I be
Shine on these hoes, name a star like me, uh
Debbie
Bumpin' that 40 and Short Dawg
Don't approach me yo' money too short, dog
'Cause I go hard like O-Dog
Ain't broke over here
Laughin' to the bank, no jokes over here
Everybody payed over here
Maid over here feelin' like the ho of the year, yeah

Most of you bitches look scared of me
Clearly, I'm laughin' at bitches like parodies (ha)
Laughin' at bitches like parodies (ha)
Laughin' at bitches like parodies (ha)
Laughin' at bitches like parodies (ha)
All of you bitches look scared of me

[Verse 2]
Uh, heavy
Most of you bitches ain't ready
Give bars to these hoes like charity
Still laughin' at bitches like parodies
Ho, ha
Laughin' at bitches like parodies
Laughin' cause none of you bitches are scarin' me
Allow me a moment of clarity
I am literally un-fuck-with-able
Flow like my pussy and that's unforgettable
Roll me a spliff or two
Bag me a bitch or two
That's what that liquor do
Woo
Turn me up one time
I don't mean no harm I just want what's mine
So I come for mine
Don't have my dough then it's dumpin' time
Like
Blocka
Blocka
Blocka
I'm gonna have to kill [?] a bitch
Stay in your lane
With a new whip from the dealership
These hoes can't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
Trees grow, we blow them back
Pay my dues, hoes on me ?
Uhh
Debbie
Bump Mac Dre and my own shit
Let it bang they be like, "Oh, shit!"
I be shittin' on my old shit
You frontin'
I'm stuntin'
Bitch can't tell me nothin'
End of discussion
Bitches can't tell me nothin'
