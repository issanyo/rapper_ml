[Intro]
Uh, you know what it is
Uh, uh, uh, yo

[Verse 1]
We on now, it's game time
Kill the game, kill my haters at the same time
It's like that, I take mine
Take your man, bag your bitch with the same line
A bitch bad, the weed good
But good pussy keeps you higher than the streets could
Double cup got me feelin' hella lit
Good livin' 'bout as good as it gets, I'm the shit
When the Henny's in the system
Ain't no tellin' I don't love 'em, I just diss 'em
Fuck is you inhalin'?
I'm a pimp by blood, no relation
Still M-O-B, no creation

[Hook]
Broke hoes tryna get rich with us
Hater hoes tryna get lit with us
Most of y'all bitches ain't shit to us
You don't fit with us, you can't sit with us
Broke hoes tryna get rich with us
Hater hoes tryna get lit with us
Most of y'all bitches ain't shit to us
You don't fit with us, you can't sit with us

[Verse 2]
Legend in my city, got that motherfuckin' padlock
These have-nots hella heated 'cause I'm mad hot
Jackpot, everything I know is dolla bills
Whole crew got 'em buzzin' off of poppin' pills
This face, pocket full of hunnids with the big face
Bitches mad I'm winnin', bein' 6th place
Taking all these losses, how that shit tastes?
I'm shitfaced
Love all my haters 'cause they made me, tho
Trendsetter, what the fuck you think they pay me for?
Mini-mes envy me, what they wanna be?
And to think I ain't even what I'm finna be

[Hook]
Broke hoes tryna get rich with us
Hater hoes tryna get lit with us
Most of y'all bitches ain't shit to us
You don't fit with us, you can't sit with us
Broke hoes tryna get rich with us
Hater hoes tryna get lit with us
Most of y'all bitches ain't shit to us
You don't fit with us, you can't sit with us
