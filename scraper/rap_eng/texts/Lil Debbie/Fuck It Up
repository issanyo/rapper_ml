Ok, alright, we atta[?], we atta[?], we atta[?]
Uh, here's a headline you bitches got the game twisted red vine
I work so hard I give bread in dead time, while they sleep like bed time I've been beaten they line
So, this is for my queens who be getting that back

I be getting them dollars, these motherfuckers be soured just know this pussy is power that's why we taking it back
I be breaking it off, you bitches making it soft
He want to take a bitch down, he pray I'm taking it off
He buy me Fendi and Gucci that's the power of coochi, that MCM and Gabbana and I ain't trickin a dollar
But all my bosses bitches on what I'm on
I ain't asking for a thing I got my own
But I ain't power tripping I throw it back likeeeeee, boy you need that ass right?

[Chorus]

[Bali Baby]

They say it's dripping water call it super soaking
Ohh they prayin I'm a fox[?], steady hoping
If it's a game then I'm having all the tokens
I tell 'em ride it like it's stolen, Paper niggas steady folden
This ain't no Texas, but I tell these niggas holdem
Don't trust it all, I like glitter it ain't golden

If he needs a fucking issue break 'em off, bust that thing wide open motherfucker take it off

[Lil Debbie]

I throw it back if he send it, but I don't fuck with that timid[?]
I just like to break em off, break em off, said he think he catching feelings, shake em off, shake em off motherfucker
I ain't fucking with emotions, just the motion in the ocean, if its open he be hoping, put a stroke in cause its soakin
He would cook, clean, spend his last penny for the pussy
Trying to shoot the club up no jimmy[?] in the pussy
All these hatin' motherfuckers acting friendly over pussy
Ima have to take their motherfucking man if she push me

[Chorus]
