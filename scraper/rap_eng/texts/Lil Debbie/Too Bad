[Verse 1]:
Deuces
Done with your excuses
Play with my emotions, all that bullshit you been shootin'
Swear that you my only one like I ain't been recruitin'
Like everyday somebody don't tell me about my beauty
Like I just light up the room
Light up the room
Fight over you
Nothin' I can do
Just know you lost me
I'm gone like I'm off rossi

[Verse 2]:
You had your chance to be with me
It ain't my fault you fucked it up
That ride or die you said you needed
Somebody else done lucked up
What happened to the promises!
Honesty!
Finer things you forgot about!
Sorry if I can't come out
'Cause my new boo is always around

[Hook]:
He make me feel so good, good
He make me feel better than you ever could
He got me feelin' fine, fine
It's too bad you outta time
You had your chance x3
(And it's too bad, it's too bad)
You had your chance x3
(Now it's too bad, too bad)

[Verse 3]:
I ain't got time for the heartache
All I got time for is getting right
The last day I spoke to you I celebrated the same night
I re-routed, I changed flies, I switched up and I got some new
Killa in the bed, wake up gettin' fed, every night is good sex I'm talkin'
Whew!
Trippin' off what I ain't missen'
Really thought I was gon' lose it?
I'm coutin' my money, he countin' his money, we both on a hustle
Just cruisin'
Shit,
To be a boss, date a boss, build an empire
You know the quote ridin' high, ride or die, ridin' fly know me we gon' make the most

[Hook]:
He make me feel so good, good
He make me feel better than you ever could
He got me feelin' fine, fine
It's too bad you outta time
You had your chance x3
(And it's too bad, it's too bad)
You had your chance x3
(Now it's too bad, it's too bad)
