[intro]
So many kinds where can we start?
We like them dumb and we like them smart
I like the one's with the pretty eyes
Well, I like all kinds of guys!
Stop. What happened?
How bout the ones we especially like?
Which ones?
They know we love the guys with the cars that go BOOM!

[hook]
Boom 8x
They know we love the guys with the cars that go boom

[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
Uh, hear the rumble in the trunk
I get goosebumps when the bassline thumps
So, let it bump...
Switchin' 4 lanes, couple blunts of the skunk
Light it up, high shit
Turn it up, that's my shit
Do a hundred on a highway
Hear this shit bump from a mile away
Can you hear it? Can you feel it, can you feel it? We the realest
Fuck all you lames you can suck on my clit
I got moves to be made, ain't no time for your shit
Word to my mother, bitch
Stunt on any other bitch
Fuck what you assume and I don't need a dude make my own shit boom like

[hook] 1x

[Verse 2: Aliky]
Aliky...
The complication of relation they be changin
I be tied up with these niggas in the game but they be playing
First they love you then they don't man these niggas is jokes
When my white touchdown I just treat em like hoes
Cupcake no feelin' recognize my worth I ain't a lame ho chillin
Gettin money on the daily cause it's fuck you, pay me
Take a shot, throw it back watch his ass go crazy
I'm in a Panamera with my bitches leaning in that
Neck breaker and my ass is fat
Got the boys tryna trap this cat
I ain't a yes, bitch, I count this act
Watch me gas this rap and fuck what it cost ho, I'm a boss ho
The main bitch that hella niggas "how u floss ho"
Tell a trick M.O.B. that's my muthafuckin' motto
Money over bitches I just play them like the lotto, BOOM!
