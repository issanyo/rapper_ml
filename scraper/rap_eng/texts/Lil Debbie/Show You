[Intro]
Ay, ay, ay
(Queen business over here)
Ay, ay, ay
Cash rules everything around me
(Bitches [?] crown, better sit on the throne)
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
(Show 'em, Debbie!)

[Verse 1]
Cash rules everything around me
Green, get the money, bitch
You wanna be the queen, get the honey
Got a beach front view and a breeze
And it seems some sunny
Bitches tryna get a dream, coming for me
I was born ready
Bitch, I'm born ready
If you wanna come against the queen
Bee, the swarm ready
Yeah, we buzzing
Bitch I been buzzin'
Took impossible and did it like it's nothing, yeah
Like a prophet, yeah, I'm like a prophet
Everything I said, I get and went and got it
What you call it? I'm just living
Meaning we the hoe that got this money coming
Flowing like a faucet, I'ma toss it
We don't even like to entertain all the talking
No discussion, we just off 'em, get the coffin
Bitches barking what you're body made of talking?
Only talking money here, motherfucker, call it

[Pre-Hook]
I so fly, can't deny that I'm high
Get rich or try it, eye for eye, do or die
I rule the world, fuck your rules, I defy
I, I do for I, made my moves move the sky

[Hook]
This is what it look like, like, like, like
Cook it, took it to the oven
Watch it risen when it's cooked right, right, right, right
You think I'm playing with you bitches? Nah
This is what it look like, like, like, like
Bithes talking way too often
I just smoking and it's good night, night, night, night, night
I'm sick of playing with you bitches, nah

[Verse 2]
Debbie, you should prolly get to know
Crash the Beamer, went and copped a Chevy nova
Paid tripping, I should prolly get a coaster
Only making bangers, I should prolly get a poster
Cruising down the coast
Rep the city like I'm 'posed to
Bitch, you know I been a roller
I'm a motherfucking soldier
I could send them hitters like a motherfuckin' Sosa
Bitches laying on the sofa, on the way the bitch is over
We don't even like to entertain all the bluffing
No discussion, all my bitches get the bussin'
Got a issue, beat these bitches like percussion
Bitches making moves, ain't no need for interruptions

[Pre-Hook]
I so fly, can't deny that I'm high
Get rich or try it, eye for eye, do or die
I rule the world, fuck your rules, I defy
I, I do for I, made my moves move the sky

[Hook]
This is what it look like, like, like, like
Cook it, took it to the oven
Watch it risen when it's cooked right, right, right, right
You think I'm playing with you bitches? Nah
This is what it look like, like, like, like
Bithes talking way too often
I just smoking and it's good night, night, night, night, night
I'm sick of playing with you bitches, nah
