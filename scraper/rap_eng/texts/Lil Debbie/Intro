Bitches thinkin' they can touch this
Fuck I look like — a iPhone?
Bitches talkin' like it's they time
They ain't even in my time zone
Bad bitch smokin' big gas
Puff, puff, bitch, no pass
White bitch with a thick ass
And when a bitch pass, I give 'em whiplash
So all you lookin' ass hoes keep watchin'
'Cause you ain't stoppin' what I punt
Look at what I'm whippin' in a pot
Lookin' when I'm pullin' out the lot
Look at what I did for the culture
Why you think they label me a boss bitch?
All up on my bread like a toaster
Now I got the flavor in the sauce, bitch
Ain't a off-switch, yeah the plug got 'em two on
Kush gone tell me, "what the fuck is you on?"
All I do is stay fresh like a new bong
All I do is run numbers like a new phone
Last week got a coupe, and it's coke white
This week got a coupe and it's two-toned
Double up on a bitch on a broke night
Double up on a bitch, put the crew on
Right back with some mo' shit — oh, shit
Still buzzin' from my old shit, no shit
Hoes talk like they know, don't know shit
Fuck you with a smile what a hoe get
Kill my old foes off, got a new list
Ring, ring, got a new phone, who dis?
Same shit, same clique, fuck a new bitch
Lil Debbie still goin', got 'em too pissed
I'ma get it
Find me and a mic and I'ma check it
I don't ever listen to a hater, ain't a damn thing
You could ever do but respect it
I'ma still do Debbie, if I never get the credit
I'ma keep gettin' money 'til I only charge debit
Bitches wanna throw shots, I ain't worried 'bout a pellet
I ain't never been about it, if I let a hater tell it, woo
If you tryna touch my riches, bitches
Then I think, it's best you get religious, bitches
Nah, I might not be as big as bitches
But they just as fad I call 'em fidget spinners
Here today and gone tomorrow
Follow trends, never bidness, so they fuckin' with us
Haters hatin', but I'm still creatin'
And we still be cakin', 'cause it's bigger bidness
Lord my witness, I'm a record
Lord my witness, I'm a record
Bitches busy talking gimme-gimme
Give 'em bars a plenty, 'cause I said it
Lord my witness, I'm the realest bitch
Lord my witness, I'm the realest bitch
Baddest bitch, I'm on my savage shit
I came to damage it
I know they feelin' this, hear me out
