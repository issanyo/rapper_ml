[Verse 1: Lil Debbie]
If you ain't with it then you shouldn't be up in this
Bad bitches with the business
Walk in and the girls all pause
Shining like a diamond, no flaws, applause
Booty clapping for the queen, ho
Twerking on the pole with the see-show
Bust it open, pussy popping like a snapback
Make it rain, make it rain, El Niño
What you need, ho? You ain't like me
Am I turned up? Bitch, I might be
Rolled another one, Imma light that bitch
See me twerking, they wanna wipe that shit
Now fade it, jade it, damned if I made it
Working the floor, got him wishing me naked
I just pop it, pop it, pop it
Pop, pop, pop, pop

[Hook: Lil Debbie]
See me twerking, they wanna wipe that shit
Now clap, clap

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
If you ain't with it then you shouldn't be up in this
Bad bitches with the business
Walk in and the girls all pause
Shining like a diamond, no flaws, applause
Booty clapping for the queen, ho
Twerking on the pole with the see-show
Bust it open, pussy popping like a snapback
Make it rain, make it rain, El Niño
My pussy right, my pussy good
I turn them out, misunderstood
I like to pop, I'm on the wood
I bang it out, ass on the hood
