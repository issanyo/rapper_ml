[Verse 1]
I popped a couple mollies
Then I hopped in that ferrari
With a couple ratchet bitches, all they wanna do is party
Got like 4 grams in my blunt (My blunt)
Promethazine in my cup (My cup)
Couple 808s in my trunk
I'm a bossy bitch, so wassup!

I tell 'em, bitch you ain't got shit on me
Queen D, yeah the crown only fit on me
That's why your man wanna feel on me
He fucking you, his mind still on me

Tell these bitches sorry, I don't really mean to tamper
And I'm too legit to quit, you can't touch it, MC Hammer
I got bitches who got bitches, they more badder than your bitches
And we hopped up in that party, let me call up some more bitches
Now we got that party bouncing, hittin' switches, hittin switches'

And you talkin' like you did this
But I lit this, you can witness
Now we turnt up and you turnt out
We burn it up and you burnt out
I'm caked up with my cakes out
And you eat that shit
One more time?

Now we turnt up and you turnt out
We burn it up and you burnt out
I'm caked up with my cakes out
And you eat that shit - Lil Debbie

[Hook: X2]

(I tell 'em) Bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me (You know it)
Bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me
I tell 'em bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me, bitch you ain't got shit on me
Queen D, yeah the crown only fit on me

[Verse 2]
They call me the baddest bitch
Lil Debbie got cakes like Trina
Might be rollin' off that molly
I'm still rollin' with that nina
Got like 4 hoes on my low pros
So we lookin' out for them pot holes
Bitch in the back keep my cup filled
Bitch in the front got my pot rolled

Bitch you ain't got shit on me!
That's word to the 510
Bay City everywhere I go
These bitches stay mad I know
Up talkin' that bossy shit
I be movin' like bosses do
White Range, Black Range
I'm so fly I could floss for two

Gold all on my neck, chrome all on my ride
Os all on my check
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Pop bottles in the VIP
All yall bitches outside
10 hoes wanna leave with me
Tell them hoes, "lets ride."

We got bitches that got bitches that more ratchet than your bitches
And your bitches want my bitches, so you leavin' with no bitches
Yeah we turnt up and you turnt out
We burnin' up and you burnt out
I'm caked up with my cakes out
And you eat that shit - Lil Debbie

[Hook: X2]

(I tell 'em) Bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me (You know it)
Bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me
I tell 'em bitch, you ain't got shit on me
You ain't got shit on me, bitch you ain't got shit on me
Queen D, yeah the crown only fit on me
