[Intro]
I been on the, I been on the way for the whole night
Chillin', it's a feelin' I been chasin' for my whole life
My whole life, my whole life
All-around-the-globe life, sharin' like it's full night

[Verse 1]
I'ma make a mark like how I illuminate the dark
I'm only tryna get you high and be the fire in this fucker
We can light it
It's lit, ah, ah, it's lit
Let's get faded 'cause we made it
Bet you hate it 'cause I'm slayin', bitch

[Hook]
We got that fire burnin', we keep it lit
We live the forever, baby, 'cause we the shit
Fuck your morals, fuck your morals
Fuck your morals, fuck your morals
Fuck your morals, morals, morals, morals
Fu-fu-fu-fuck, we-we-we're immortal

[Drop]

[Hook]
We got that fire burnin', we keep it lit
We live the forever, baby, 'cause we the shit
We got that fire burnin', we keep it lit
We live the forever, baby, 'cause we the shit!

[Drop]

[Verse 1: Repeat]
I'ma make a mark like how I illuminate the dark
I'm only tryna get you high and be the fire in this fucker
We can light it
It's lit, ah, ah, it's lit
Let's get faded 'cause we made it
Bet you hate it 'cause I'm slayin', bitch

[Hook]
We got that fire burnin', we keep it lit
We live the forever, baby, 'cause we the shit
Fuck your morals, fuck your morals
Fuck your morals, fuck your morals
Fuck your morals, morals, morals, morals
