[Hook]
I got that purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake
Purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake (cake)

[Verse 1]
Bitch I bake it like Hostess
Lil Debbie ho you know what the coast is
Where that purple good
And that grape is strong
And My temper short
But my money long
Cause I cook it for 'em quite often
They flippin' for it like dolphins
These bitches boring like golfin'
I get 'em all in a coffin
I put 'em in a box like muffin mix
That Betty Crocker, that other shit
That too hot you need an oven mitt
That too hot you need an oven mitt
That soda on the counter
Add two cups of Debbie Downer
And a spoon full of sugar make the medicine go down

[Hook]
I got that purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake
Purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake (cake)

[Verse 2]
Instapic so your bitch can look
No apron on so you can watch me cook
I bake a cake
Iron chef
Catch your body like safety nets
They tryna take my style
They been tryna take my recipe
Sweet tooth and I bit it
Paul Wall my dentist
They still sendin' me hate mail
Cause I got cake like a bake sale
Like, "thank you, please come again."
I'm at your neck
Just like a double chin
Purple, grape I'm drippin'
Aunt Jemima, we sippin'
Keep the oven 350
Watch the pies turn golden brown

[Bridge]
Let's cook, cook, cook
If you in the kitchen, bitch
Let's cook, cook, cook
If you in the kitchen, bitch

[Hook]
I got that purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake
Purple, grape
I can bake a cake
I can bake a cake (cake)

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie]
All these hoes get a complex
When I go to work with the Pyrex
I'm new fashion
They old fashion
I'm still shinin'
My gold flashin'
You and me, we not the same
Lil Debbie - household name
You cookie cutter - Easy Bake
I'm purple grape
That's how you bake a cake
