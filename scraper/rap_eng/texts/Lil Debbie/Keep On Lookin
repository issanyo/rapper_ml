[Verse 1]
Gotta go hard, be my own motivation (motivation)
Never liked rules, give a fuck if I break them (You know I'ma break 'em)
Bitter ass bitches, I'm the way to be hangin' (Lil' bitches)
So I ain't even lookin' at my notifications
Internet bangers got 'em sick with they statements
Hundred grand stacked in the floor of the basements
Only fast lanes when I roll on the pavements (skrrt)
Bitches say I'm lucky, I say life what you make it (skrrt)
I'ma get to it, I just go out and take it
'Cause I ain't never fuckin' with a dead broke
Everyday, best dressed with the best smoke
Go frames, go chain, like I sell dope
If we get technical bitch, we sell dope, hear me out
Gotta show style, 'cause they watch plot thickens
Bitches plot for the top spot, stop wishin'
Mind on the grind every time clock ticking
Shoot your best shot, bitch alive, y'all missing
Hoes want a piece of the pie, no working
Shit much deeper than the weed and the twerkin'
I'm a true go-getter, no really I'm earning
You can study my move, guarantee you'll never learn it

[Chorus]
Bitch goin' hard 'cause they lookin'
Baby lookin'
Play my part 'cause they lookin'
Fuck bein' humble 'cause they lookin'
Hopin' I fumble is why they lookin'
Yeah they lookin'
But they ain't never 'bout to see me fall off
Bitch keep lookin'
Workin' every day, never call off
Keep on lookin'
Everything I tellin' be the facts
Keep on lookin'
Bow when I sellin' see the racks
Keep on lookin'

[Verse 2]
It's a fact
Comin' out slayin', it's a rap
Is it crack?
A-move you know's how to get a bigger track
Came out swingin' putting bitches on the map
Name's still ringin' and my city on the map
Flex game real, bitch I kill 'cause I can, so I will
I don't do it for the gram or the snap
Still they be slidin' in my DMs, like in my BMs
While I just slide up in the BM, gotta put the key in
I gotta push to start
If you tell me "You the queen" better look the part
I'ma hit the mark
Bitch I been at this for so long
I'm so gone, like Golem, I'm so on
Don't fuck with my buzz
Bitch I'm wisecrackin' so fuck what it was
Watch how I slay every day just because
Hear me out, I'm a boss bitch
Kill shit, where my dog's at?
Hit my line, I decline, never call back
Better fall back, hater shit, bitch I'm off that
Rather see the whole team me, get to toss that
Do what I say and I say what I mean
Stay on my green, you just stay on the scene
You played for attention, I played for the team
Bitch I never sleep, but I'm livin' a dream

[Chorus]
Bitch goin' hard 'cause they lookin'
Baby lookin'
Play my part 'cause they lookin'
Fuck bein' humble 'cause they lookin'
Hopin' I fumble is why they lookin'
Yeah they lookin'
But they ain't never 'bout to see me fall off
Bitch keep lookin'
Workin' every day, never call off
Keep on lookin'
Everything I tellin' be the facts
Keep on lookin'
Bow when I sellin' see the racks
Keep on lookin'
