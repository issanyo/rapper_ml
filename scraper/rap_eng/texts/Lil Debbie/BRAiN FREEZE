[Hook: Riff Raff]
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze

[Verse 1: Riff Raff]
Ice, right, thunderstormer fade
Drop 50 on my braids and my wrist 20K
But my ear, damn, my ear a frozen yam
Ice water on the band with the somersault slam
Body slam competition, frostbit air conditioning
Want me in a bad position cause I'm in my own division
Dissolve the solution, nationwide recruiting
I don't want your damn girl, she's Craigslist prostitution
Ice, rice, don't get blinded by the sight
I could fracture street lights, rolling dice with Mark Price
Rap game Janet Jackson in the khakis Jack Black Benz
Ice on my ear got me balling like the Pac-10

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
Lil Debbie, I don't ask for permission
Pull up four-wheel twisting while my diamonds are glistening
Ice in ear, ice in watch, watch me freeze your whole block
Stop hating like the cops before I connect all the dots
When it comes to houses, I've got more spots than a dalmatian
30 carats on the bracelet got you by the phone waiting
Will I call, should I ball, that ain't even a question
June 2012 I'm giving syrup sipping lessons
I don't pop too many pills cause that really ain't my style
It's your girl Lil Debbie, I pour a four on a Black and Mild
Take advantage (take advantage), lil mama about to panic
Ice in my ear damn-near froze the Atlantic
Lil Debbie

[Hook: Riff Raff]
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me brain freeze
Give me, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
Ice in my ear, give me brain freeze
