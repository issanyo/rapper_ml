[Verse 1]
Watch me work the cake
Got that goodie, goodie, goodie
Ride a hunnid bad bitches
Pussy, pussy, pussy
Way these bitches throwin' pussy
It could prolly kill their father
But you know this shit is poppin'
Got the molly in the water

[Hook]
Feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
Ain't no way you high as us, high as us, high as us
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
Ain't no way you high as us, high as us, high as us
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
All my bitches feel the rush, rush, rush, rush, rush...
All my bitches feel the

[Chorus]
This one's for my hoes
Yeah, those my bitches
And my bitches drop it low
Yeah, that's their business
Throwin' money in the air
My bands, they poppin'
Livin' life without a care
I make these motherfuckers choose-up
I make these motherfuckers choose-up

[Verse 2]
Shots goin' up, panties on the floor now
Now if you ain't with gettin' ratchet
Then it's best you hit the door now
Bitches get explicit
So it's best you prolly out here
'Cause you know this shit is poppin'
Got the molly in the water

[Hook]
Feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
Ain't no way you high as us, high as us, high as us
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
Ain't no way you high as us, high as us, high as us
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
All my bitches feel the rush, feel the rush, feel the rush
All my bitches feel the rush, rush, rush, rush, rush...
All my bitches feel the

[Chorus]
This one's for my hoes
Yeah, all of my bitches
And my bitches droppin' low
Yeah, that's their business
Throwin' money in the air
My bands, they poppin'
Livin' life without a care
I make these motherfuckers choose-up
I make these motherfuckers choose-up
