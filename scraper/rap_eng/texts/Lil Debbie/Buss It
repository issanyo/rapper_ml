(Verse 1)
Buss it like you caught red-handed
Buss it like a bank check bandit
Get ratchet, no romantics
Buss it from Pacific all the way to the Atlantic, woah
Drop it down low to the floor
Now you lettin' all your inhibitions go
Now you takin' off your clothes, cos you sweatin'
Do it for a couple bank rolls, now I'm bettin'
That she do it for the loafer, hair done, nails and toes
Pretty girls everywhere, here we go
Take a photo, let 'em know you fancy, though
Hashtag: "BussIt" for 'em, can't say no
Buss it, yeah, I'm hotdog, ketchup, mustard
Let 'em get a little hot sauce, they'll love it
If he doesn't, then you tell him that he buggin'
Back it up for him, let him know you workin' with some luggage
Take it up hot, cos we goin' on a trip
Everyone invited, we all in this
That cutie on the side, yeah, I'm blowin' him a kiss
Pass out the zip, now we all gettin' lit
Make a wish when you see me, I'm shootin' like a star
Got my chicks all with me actin' rudely at the bar
Faded, no, I can't debate it if you hate it
I'mma call you clouds, cos you shaded
You should buss it for a real bitch
Buss it, show me how I'm real
Yeah, buss it for a real bitch
Buss it, show me how I'm real, get

(Chorus)
Buss it (x7)
Buss it (x7)
Buss it (x7)
Buss it (x7)
Drop it down, buss it on the floor
Bring it back up, twerk a little more
I'mma show you how to do it, hoe
Yeah, I'mma show you how I do it, hoe
Drop it down, buss it on the floor
Bring it back up, twerk a little more
I'mma show you how to do it, hoe
Yeah, I'mma show you how I do it, hoe

(Post-chorus)
Buss it for a hair done, nails and toes
Pretty girls everywhere, here we go
Take a photo let 'em know you fancy, though
Hashtag: "BussIt" for 'em, can't say no

(Verse 2)
Buss it, like a football, rush it
Stomp hard, buss it and crush it
If she hate it, make a man love it
Watchin' all my videos, make a fan of him
If he askin' you to buss it for him
Let him know what you gon' buss it for
Buss it for the vine, buss it cos you fine
Buss it cos you like to buss it, buss it all the time
Buss it then you flip mode, Busta Rhymes
Buss it when you standin' on line
Busted in the bathroom, doin' lines
Busted on the news, girl, it's gon' be a crime
Buss it, twerk somethin'
Buss it, do it like it's nothin'
If he askin' you to buss it for him
Let him know what you gon' buss it for

(Chorus)

(Post-chorus)

(Verse 3)
Baby come and buss it for me
Buss it, put your trust into the beat
Buss it cos I know that you a freak
Buss it like it's mustard on the beat
Buss it open when you in the street
Buss it open in between the sheets
Buss it like you do it for a feed
Buss it open when you hear the beat
Buss it, go on, buss it for me
Buss it, buss it for me
Buss it, go on, buss it for me
Buss it, buss it for me
Buss it all day, from Atlanta to the bay
Buss it all day, from New York to MIA
