[Intro]
Stunt on a bitch, ey, ey
Ey, ey
Kid Classic
Ey, ey

[Chorus]
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit

[Verse 1]
I invented this shit, bitch you can't pay for this shit
I never played by the rules, there ain't no taming this bitch
Fuck that talk, my money talking, my type of language is shit
They say I changed cause I'm rich, I don't feel shame for this shit
I been a ref in a rip, ain't no respect for their lip
Serving these bitches so long, it's only right when they tip, shit
It's only right that I serve, bottles on special reserve
I don't react on the swerve, I don't go back on my word

[Bridge]
Bitch know my word is my bond, I'm always smoking that bong
I got your man in my arm, I got your world in my palm
Bitch I prefer to be calm, but I bring the terror, Saddam
I'm calling shots like a don, bitch I'm a boss you a pawn, fuck is you want

[Chorus]
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit

[Verse 2]
I may just stunt on a bitch, I pop the wheelies and shit
Yeah I'm too sick with the tricks, I'm bout as real as it gets
I may just stunt on a bitch, roll up a blunt on a bitch
Yeah I just roll with the hits, I never fumble or flinch
Never been humble a bit, I just been sick with the charm
I'm like the baddest of blondes, you just a pro with the cons
I'm just the best of the pros, never been stressing you hoes
That's why I flip 'em the bird, I don't go back on my word

[Bridge]
Bitch know my word is my bond, I'm always smoking that bong
I got your man in my arm, I got your world in my palm
Bitch I prefer to be calm, but I bring the terror, Saddam (yeah)
I'm calling shots like a don (yeah), bitch I'm a boss you a pawn, fuck is you want

[Chorus]
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit
I'm still the queen of this shit, feel like I just found a niche
I ain't gonna quit 'til I'm paid, yeah I just stunt on a bitch
I know they want me to slip, just want something to flip
That's why I walk with a chip, ain't no more room where I sit
