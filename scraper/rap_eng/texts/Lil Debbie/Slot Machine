[Verse 1]
All this cash on me
But you gotta shake that ass for free
All that ass gotta add a fee
I'm about to pull that slot machine

Jackpot, jackpot right out the crackpot
Toys like match box
Do It like
Now you hittin' that spot
Baby, do it to me like we are on film
Make it real nasty make a biatch say ew


Slow down, speed it back up
After that nut, better get it back up
Better get it back up, hit it like a mack truck
Is you really that tough, is you really that stunt

Gone and put the fuel in that spaceship
We about to cruise on a day trip
We be on the move and we make chip
Bet on that money like vegas, yeah

[Hook X2]
All this cash on me
But you gotta shake that ass for free
All that ass gotta add [?]
I'm about to pull that - cha ching
Slot machine, slot machine, I'm about to pull that slot machine
Slot machine, slot machine, I'm about to pull that slot machine

[Verse 2]
Callin' all money makers
Lil Debbie, I'm a baker
Bad bitch, trouble maker
Watch me kill it, undertaker
Freaky, freaky freaky bands
Flash and dance for a cash advance
Tag you in, with you and a friend
Its the weekend, could you do it again?

I just wanna see you get naked
Like a hunnid dollar bill, gone and break it
Give it to me, til I can't take it
Like the dice at the crap table, shake it, yeah

[Hook X2]
