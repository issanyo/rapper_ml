[Intro]
K Classic

[Verse 1]
Silly bitch always talkin' 'bout Debbie ain't raw
Debbie ain't real, Debbie don't kill
Too trill, I done told y'all bitches
I'ma show y'all bitches no chill, silly hoes know
Hatin' ass bitch, a debatin' ass bitch
What'chu mad, you ain't-done-nothin-lately ass bitch
Hoe you hot that I pop, bitch stop
I'm a gun off safety ass bitch, bang bang, hoe
Bitch is talkin' with my back turned
Always wanna smile in my face
Caught 'em takin' my place
Girl stop, bitch freeze, bitch please
Slap a hoe to the mouth, lose taste, talk now tho
Motherfucker tryna hit, talk slick like I'm pitchin' my shit
Like I could pitch it underhand
You can know exactly where it's gonna land
You ain't never hittin' this shit motherfucker

[Refrain]
I came in alone, I'ma die alone
Don't call for a favor, all you're gettin' is a dial tone
And my stock goin' up
You might wanna check the dow jones
Bitch, I'm all the way up, ain't no pay cuts
Straight to majors, they mad they ain't us
And now I'm like fuck that

[Hook]
They think I'm going crazy
Maybe that's what you made me
Maybe that's why these bitches salty
And they love to hate me
They say my bars too vulgar
Hoe, I'm just gettin' colder
And that's the way it is until I say it's fuckin' over
They think I'm going crazy
Maybe that's what you made me
Maybe that's why these bitches salty
And they love to hate me
They say my bars too vulgar
Hoe, I'm just gettin' colder
And that's the way it is until I say it's fuckin' over
Fuck that!

[Verse 2]
Radio station amazing
They still ain't playin' my shit
They can never say they made my shit
Knowin' god damn well these bitches can't fade my shit
Real shit bitch
Stupid hoe tryna tell me that I drink too much
Smoke too much, joke too much
So what hoe, I'm dope too much
Take a dick, you can choke on nuts
What'chu thought, hoe?
Record label told me that my image ain't clean
What'chu mean, I'm the queen on the scene
Got the team, in a dream Kush and the lean
Fuck y'all I'm still gettin' green
What'chu talking 'bout?
Every bitch sayin' Debbie ain't wreckin' shit
Microphone checkin' shit, killin' every record shit
Got it goin', check a bitch, teach a bitch a lesson shit
You ain't gotta like it bitch to show you gon' respect this shit

[Refrain]
I came in alone, I'ma die alone
Don't call for a favor, all you're gettin' is a dial tone
And my stock goin' up
You might wanna check the dow jones
Bitch, I'm all the way up, there ain't no pay cuts
Straight to majors, they mad they ain't us
And now I'm like fuck that

[Hook]
They think I'm goin' crazy
Maybe that's what you made me
Maybe that's why these bitches salty
And they love to hate me
They say my bars too vulgar
Hoe, I'm just gettin' colder
And that's the way it is until I say it's fuckin' over
They think I'm going crazy
Maybe that's what you made me
Maybe that's why these bitches salty
And they love to hate me
They say my bars too vulgar
Hoe, I'm just gettin' colder
And that's the way it is until I say it's fuckin' over
Fuck that!
