[Intro: Charlotte Devaney]
Animal
Yah

[Verse 1: Charlotte Devaney]
Bounce to get this, to get this aww
Take the bait c-come get me off
Bake the cake with that cherry butter sauce
Lick my whip
I wanna taste it
Mmm
Down bitch you is basic
(yah)
I’m the bad bitch , you be hating
Going broke back with a fake thing
(haha)
I do it real quick no dating

[Refrain: Knytro]
Say you wanna ride then lets ride out
It’s my whip this is my house
Apple flav
Take a bite out
Supreme Louis with the red and white style

[Pre-Chorus: Charlotte Devaney & Knytro]
Say what you say what you say
(yah)
They play they throw it away
(yah)

I’m liking the flavours of girls in Barbados
You know what they know how to play
(yah)

Candy shopping in a Lambogi
Move through cities, sipping Hennessy

Mackin’ in a sunny villa
Taking numbers go for dinner
In the mood
Feeling like an Animal


[Chorus: Charlotte Devaney]
Animal
Yah
Animal
(Animal Animal)
(Animal Animal)
I’m a mother fucking wa


[Verse 2: Knytro]
You can see i’m going hard always on the go
Flintstones
Bowling ball
With the twinkle toes
I’m in the zone
Music making megaphone
Bring it on because their head as big as Megladon
Sledgehammer wait till they send it down awe
Said ima get it , i'm bout to break you all
Hands on the wheel
I’ll show you how we roll
Drop Top
Do the Mingo

[Refrain: Knytro]
Say you wanna ride then lets ride out
It’s my whip this is my house
Apple flav
Take a bite out
Supreme Louis with the red and white style

[Pre-Chorus: Charlotte Devaney & Knytro]
Say what you say what you say
(yah)
They play they throw it away
(yah)

I’m liking the flavours of girls in Barbados
You know what they know how to play
(yah)

Candy shopping in a Lambogi
Move through cities, sipping Hennessy

Mackin’ in a sunny villa
Taking numbers go for dinner
In the mood
Feeling like an Animal


[Chorus: Charlotte Devaney]

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie & Knytro]
Yo
I’ll be in the drop i’ll be slotting through
Your city litty
And you’re roaring like a lion do
Heard you wanna see the queen what you trying to do
I be front in line
All my bitches they be riding to
Tried to tell them in a mother fucking animal
Let em go savage
I’m a eat em like a cannibal
If its ever time to ride , always down to roll
Bout to pop another bottle
Got a pound of blow (yah) (yah) (yah)
