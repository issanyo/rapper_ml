[Hook]

Ho, we are not the same

Uh, [?] all in my [?]
She wanna fuck with the gang
All my cards in her name
50 racks on these chains

We are not the same
Pussy we are not the same
We are not the same pussy we are not the same

My ho sharp as [?]
Gave that bitch a hunnid racks

Damn near had a heart attack
Green MCM bag, lookin' like a Skittle pack
One bitch kiss another bitch, shawty can you get with that?

My supply is Diamond, yo shit is rhinestone
10 Deep hoodie, hah, with the [?] on
Pussy, I see what you got your eyes on

Get more cheese than the [?] zone
Got a bitch who [?] five points, she smoke weed like a [?]
Got a bitch in a Bucket who slide through and come get me

I got a who in Magic City, my name all on her titties
Got a bitch who you in love with, she suckin' me and my niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rolls Royce Rizzy]
[?] chain on with the [?], make a nigga bitch choose
We gone run yo bitch, nigga
Tell her bring her gym shoes
Cause she a ratchet bitch with that ratchet mouth
Shawty put that ass out
She a freaky bitch, she said she want the dick
Let a nigga tap out

Jumpin' 'round on the stage, bitches screamin' my name
She geeked up off them mollies, said it takes away the pain
[?] a bitch off the cascade, wanna go to masquerade
But she got a friend that go both ways, hit them hoes on different days
Your nigga? He fucked up
They ran into his kush spot
I met a bitch and she geeked up, suck a nigga off like a push pop
My sex game is A1, make a bitch puss pop
My little bitch, she thug life, call her ass 2Pac

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Debbie]
I ain't-ain't got no time
For no fuck bitches
Can't see my eyes, behind shaded lenses
I'm in the backseat, rubber-banded Benjamins
Rollin' Kush, with the orange hairs in it

I ain't trippin' off shit
I'm gettin' run like Forrest
My money flowin' just right
Have you tasted Baby Bear's porridge?
See, the block is hot like Papa Bears
And my heart's cold like Mama's is

That's @L1LDebbie, you hatin' bitches be followin'
Takin' phone pics in yo bathroom
On Instagram like y'all modelling
We are not the same
You don't resemble Debbie a lil bit
My records spin all day
There's writing for it, no queasy, bitch
In the studio gettin' my hair done, makin' hits, I make it look easy bitch

[Hook]
