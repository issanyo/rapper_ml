[Verse 1]
You know you fuckin' with the real now
Li'l bitches better chill down
Fuck the fame, started out I didn't have a crumb to my name
We eatin' five course meals now
And I'm still down, couple bands in the paper bag
Switchin' lanes with the paper tags
Type of swag that can make 'em mad
Tellin' bitches tryna take a jab
I just fuckin' laugh, ha
Bitch, you better get it right
I don't need the love, can I get a light?
Spotlight, fuck your oversight
Bitches must've thought I got this overnight
Silly hoes, really though
Bitch, you better know the deal
Hit 'em with some new shit
So you bitches know it's real overkill
You in the presence of the motherfuckin' ruler
Just point me to the mission, I'm the driver and the shooter
Bitch, I get it

[Hook]
What it look like? Bitch, I feel good
Left the trap for this rap, but I'm still hood
Bitches livin' shit but they ain't livin' this good
Got this paper on my own, wish a bitch would
What it look like? Bitch, I feel great
Top down, buck 50 on the interstate
Used to get it by the gram, now it's real way
Turned the bitches that are hatin' and I'm still straight

[Verse 2]
Straight down so it's only looking up now
And your city gettin' busy when I touch down
My days one's the only bitches that I trust now
All I need is weed and a swisha for me to buss down, on gawd
Bitches always asking how I do this shit?
Time again I remind them I ain't new to this
Number one stunna always see me in the newest shit
Couple bands, can't remember how I blew this shit, oh lawd
Toast to the bitches who told me I'll never do this
Laughing at them bitches who told me we never be up
Now the same bitches is salty and lookin' foolish
Now it's paparazzi, red carpets I know you bitches see us
I know you see us, and you hate to see me winnin' ha
Love me back when I was broke in the beginnin' ha
Still the same, I just had to change a lane up
Get my change up, bitch, but I ain't never change up

[Bridge]
So pour a cup, roll a blunt it's a celebration
To you sour ass hoes, it's a dedication
Smilin' in my fuckin' face, they be hella hatin'
Cuz we eatin' over here, bitch, we hella cakin'
Yeah we hella cakin'
Yeah we hella cakin'
In the kitchen whip it proper, yeah we hella bakin'
Yeah we hella bakin'
Yeah we hella bakin'
Debbie back to killin' bitches only god can save

[Hook]
What it look like? Bitch, I feel good
Left the trap for this rap, but I'm still hood
Bitches livin' shit but they ain't livin' this good
Got this paper on my own, wish a bitch would
What it look like? Bitch, I feel great
Top down, buck 50 on the interstate
Used to get it by the gram, now it's real way
Turned the bitches that are hatin' and I'm still straight
