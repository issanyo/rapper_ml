[Intro]
Work that pussy, bitch

[Hook]
Work that pussy, bitch, I move it
Let me show you how we do it

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
Now it's poppin' in its place
Kill that crowd, might catch a case
Back up off me, I'm too salty
I'm so gone, can't feel my face
Bitches ratchet, so what's up
Hands up, we don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Work that pussy, bitch, I move it
Let me show you how we do it

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
You know how it goes, hoe
So much hate's got a overflow
When I touch down got my own grow
Bitch, I blow, blow, blow
Somethin' 'bout this torso
Debbie got a deal that you wanna know
When I pop that pussy then I go so

[Verse 1]
Now it's poppin' in its place
Kill that crowd, might catch a case
Back up off me, I'm too salty
I'm so gone, can't feel my face
Bitches ratchet, so what's up
Hands up, we don't give a fuck

[Hook]
Work that pussy, bitch, I move it
Let me show you how we do it

[Drop]
