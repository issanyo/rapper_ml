[Intro: Hit-Boy]
Who the plug?
These niggas be askin' "who the plug?"
HS87, nigga that's the plug

[Hook: B Mac The Queen]
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 1: B Mac The Queen]
I will never know why bitches fake
And I will never know why niggas hate
I'm ridin' through my town, you see that's B Mac on the plates
Don't mistake me for a lame, you know that I cannot relate
Fuck what you gotta say, I'm out here every day, pockets straight
Not too late, I'ma count more cake, now souffle then I'm out your way
Now let me show you how it's done, show you how it's done
If you workin' month to month just to get enough then you know what's up
Middle fingers up
Fade that shit!

[Hook: B Mac The Queen]
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face

[Verse 2: Lil Debbie]
G's up, Oak Town, fire truck, hose down
You dusty ass bitches prolly come from Broke Town
Struttin' out the bank, puffin' on dank
I'm gettin' filthy rich so my attitude stank
Pickin' up my best friend (Who?) Benjamin Frank
I know dollars make sense, I ain't even have to think
Forget about a hater, someone gotta do the job
Light the gun with that potato, this the mothafuckin' mob
This that Don Corleone, I better get my cheddar
Mozzarella, Provolone, or send shots through your home
Call my goons on the phone, speakin' in code
No HTML, no pasta, just shells
Everything for sale, got grams off that scale
Got fans sendin' that mail, I ride the wave like a sail
Can't you tell, ho?

[Hook: B Mac The Queen]
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face
Bitch I'm here for the pay
If you hatin', get the fuck up out my face

[Bridge: Lil Debbie]
That ching-ching-ching-ching
(Don't stop)
That ching-ching-ching-ching
(Don't stop)

[Outro: Lil Debbie (B Mac The Queen)]
(Bitch I'm here for the pay)
Bet you Hit-Boy like this, he be vouchin' for me
While I count this money
(Bitch I'm here for the pay)
Bet you Hit-Boy like this, he be vouchin' for me
While I count this money
Everything for sale
Everything for sale
Everything for sale
Everything for sale
