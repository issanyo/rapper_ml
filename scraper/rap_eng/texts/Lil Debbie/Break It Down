[Intro]
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down, bitch
Break it down, break it down, break it down, bitch
Break it down, break it down, break it down, bitch
Break it down, break it down, bitch
Break, break it down, bitch

[Verse 1]
Mmm, dont you wanna hit it?
If you get it, I promise you won't forget it
Turn you to a fiend, I'll admit it
It's on and popping, I'll break it down then I split it
Might turn you out, boy; freak by nature
If I put it on you, only God can save you
Only God can judge me for my rude behavior
Middle finger to a hater as I chase my paper, I
Smoke green, bitch, I'm fresh on the scene
Your worst nightmare but your man's wet dream
Might need icing, cause I got that cake
Break it down, break it down, shake, shake
Break it down, roll it up, let's smoke
Something like the kush, bitch, I'm dope
Something like the realest, so I ain't no joke
OG, we smoke, you choke, deepthroat
Let's get it!

[Hook]
Blunts of the smoke, bottles on chill
My shit bang, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down
Blunts of the smoke, blowing that kill
Pass me a light, bitch, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down

[Post-Hook]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Break it down, put it down, go far
Take them down, roll them up, blow hard
Turn it up, go home, or go hard
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Break it down, put it down, go far
Take them down, roll them up, blow hard
Turn it up, go home, or go hard

[Verse 2]
I got accustomed to the high life, yeah that's my life
Turn it up, every night be the highlight
Good brain, deep pockets, yeah, that's my type
Put, put it in your mouth, yeah, that's my flight
The head good, the sex good
Break it down, put it on you better than the next could
My money right, my team good
Top flight, hella faded cause the green good
I'm just doing me, that's what I know
Blowing two or three, that's a hydro
Took 'em all down, so my eyes low
Cause it's all fly, that's what I blow
Live your own life, that's what I say
So I'm living every day like it's friday
Higher than a 747, that's where I stay
Running through another on a tube, that's a highway

[Hook]
Blunts of the smoke, bottles on chill
My shit bang, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down
Blunts of the smoke, blowing that kill
Pass me a light, bitch, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down

[Bridge]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Go far
Blow hard
Go hard
Boys to the yard
Go far
Blow hard
Go hard

[Hook]
Blunts of the smoke, bottles on chill
My shit bang, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down
Blunts of the smoke, blowing that kill
Pass me a light, bitch, fuck how you feel for real
Break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down
