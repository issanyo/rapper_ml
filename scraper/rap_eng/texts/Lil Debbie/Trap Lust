[Intro]
Trappin trappin trappin trappin
Making, I be making, making, making, making
Stackin paper stackin stackin stackin stackin
Laughin I be laughin laughin laughin laughin laughin

[Hook]
I got lust for the money I be so turned on
My bank account give me orgasms
That money come fallin, that pussy be pourin
But no need to worry my towel Ralph Lauren

[Verse 1]
I'm learning new language
My currency foreign
Fuck (fuck) who you came with
Your crew is so boring
Focus on gaining this wealth
Hating is bad for your health
Fuck with me? You will get dealt with
My hitters is all on that cell
See, destiny, we gotta get it
You super mad, you need a cape
Your goons in your group could get blamed
In total you cannot escape
Bitch, I'm in the game, money on the table
Bustin, out the frame, watch me like cable
Bring the Colt 45, now that's stable
You gon take flight out a ladle
We're all on that Lean now I'm falling asleep
Fell in a dream tell you all that I see
I was dripped out in that luxury
Everything custom, I woke up by bed was the sea

[Hook]
I got lust for the money I be so turned on
My bank account give me orgasms
That money come fallin, that pussy be pourin
But no need to worry my towel Ralph Lauren
I got lust for the money I be so turned on
My bank account give me orgasms
That money come fallin, that pussy be pourin
But no need to worry my towel Ralph Lauren

[Verse 2]
Jokes on you mane
I need that money like Bruce Wane
To these birds imma bat
I'll turn into dracula
Money flippin with the spatula
Black diamonds from Africa
Me not shinning is a conflict
Deb shooting out the passenger
Whatever I do is going up high
Get that money then it's bye bye
All true no lie lie
Have your shirt like tie dye
Your whole fam cry cry
You go night night
While I party in Paradise loving the lavish life
You said I'm a savage right? End your life with this savage night
Yeah I go beast mode, then I'm back in the streets, ho
