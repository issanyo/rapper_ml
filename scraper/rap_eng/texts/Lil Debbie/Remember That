[Intro]
Yup, yup
Bitch, I remember that
Yup, hear me out
Hear me out, hear me out, hear me out

[Verse 1]
Back when I needed my paper up
They never gave a fuck
Told me my shit was beginner's luck
Shit, I'm still here as fuck
I ain't got time for no new friends
I just need new fans
Money exposes your true friends
And I got me some new bands
So I'm tyin' up loose ends
And I'm makin' some new plans
And I'm settin' some new trends
I'm bakin', I'm bakin', I'm cakin'
And you bitches too bland, take my two hands
Made magic, go get it, said I can't have it
Bitches phoney and I can't bag it
And I don't need it if I can't cash it, no
I gave a fuck about the law
Ain't no option but to ball
Hall of fame, hall of fame
I need my jersey on the wall
Game time, game time
Fuck you I take mine
You bitches need some new bundles
No hang time, hang time

[Hook]
Do you remember that ?
Rememeber they told me that my shit was average
Yo, who could remember that?
Now my shit poppin', I'm posin' for camera
Yea, I remember though
Remember they told me this shit wouldn't happen
I swear I remember, hoe
'Cause now my shit crackin', they hop on the wagon but still
I remember though
Do you remember, hoe?
Shit I remember though
But you just a simple hoe
I'm glad I ain't listen though
But still I remember, hoe
Yea, I remember, hoe
Yea, I remember, hoe
Yea, I remember, hoe

[Verse 2]
Remember they told me to stop rappin'
Silly bitches told me stop trappin'
Stand out now we outstandin'
Made manoeuvres now we got the action
Went from a gram to a zip
Zips flipped into a couple Ps
Savage bitch, you can't smoke for free
Now a bitch is up from a couple trees
Who can fuck with me
Elevator, elevator
To the top hella paper
Skyline my time
Bitches dyin' respirator
Flatline, flatline
Flatline, flatline
I ain't change the game, that's fine
Stat line, stat line
Show these bitches how to win it
Independent can't pretend a bitch ain't did it
You can say that I assisted grind precision
Shine consistent, bitch, I'm different
Funny how these bitches get amnesia
Now I'm hot as fever, please, believe it
Kill these bitches off like I'm the reaper
Blowin' reefer guarantee, I'll eat ya
