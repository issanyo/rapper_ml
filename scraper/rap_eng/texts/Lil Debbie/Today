[Intro]
Get it good, get it, got it good, get it
Get it good, get it, got it good

[Verse 1]
Today, I made my money in a new way
I blew a hunnid K on Tuesday
Don't give a fuck about what'chu say
Fuck what'chu say
Today, none of these new bitches amuse me
You bitches played out like a two-way
I live my life just like a movie

[Hook]
Throw-throw-throw beats, we smash on it
We go hard like "Oh, Lord"
Throw-throw beats, we smash on it
We go hard like "Oh, Lord"
I means my doe, bitch, I means my doe
Bitch, I means my doe, I don't give a fuck about...

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I don't give a fuck if my check's alright
Frames all black, flow off-white
Crack motherfucker, yeah, my shit so fly
Only gettin' started, it's gon' be a long night
Flexin', flexin', flexin' cash on it
Throw beats, we smash on it
We go hard like "Oh, Lord"
That high life lived fast on
Bitches stayin' high like my base down low
Grow my fuckin' money, bitch, I means my doe

[Hook]
Throw-throw-throw beats, we smash on it
We go hard like "Oh, Lord"
Throw-throw beats, we smash on it
We go hard like "Oh, Lord"
I means my doe, bitch, I means my doe
Bitch, I means my doe, my doe, doe
I don't give a fuck

[Drop]

[Outro]
Get it, get it, get it good, get it
Get it, get it, get it good, get it
Get it, get it, get it good, get it
Get it, get it, get it good, get it
