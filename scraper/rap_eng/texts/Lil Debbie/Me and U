[Verse 1]
Mirrors haven't always been my best friend
But when I look at you all I see is reflection
I know when you mad and if you stressin'
I know when you need addressin' when you feel like sexin'
See, part of me is high off the affection
But all of me is high off this connection
Just promise me that you won't disconnect
And if the signal start to fade, you better hit me with a text
And every time you gone I be thinkin' 'bout the last time
Even when you wrong I be lookin' like you mad fine
That's how you get me
And that's how I get you
And together we inseparable

[Hook]
I'm in love with this moment
I'm in love with right now
So baby, come hold me
Baby, come hold me down
Wherever you're going
A part of me will be with you
How do I know this?
'Cause I can see the me in you

[Post-Hook]
Everywhere you go
And everywhere you are
I can feel your love
You ain't really far
Said, everywhere you go
And everywhere you are
I can feel your love
You ain't really far

[Verse 2]
Across the world, I'll book a flight
Let's fall in love again
We gonna fall when autumn fall
Take off in the wind
You cooler than a breeze
Warmer than the summer air
Don't care 'bout what they told me
Thought you was all a care
Funny how the world works
With everything there is
A pair of shoes, a pair of wings
And me and you right here
I'll put that on me
You'll never be lonely

[Hook]
I'm in love with this moment
I'm in love with right now
So baby, come hold me
Baby, come hold me down
Wherever you're going
A part of me will be with you
How do I know this?
'Cause I can see the me in you

[Bridge]
Mirrors haven't always been my best friend
But when I look at you all I see is reflection
I know when you mad and if you stressin'
I know when you need addressin' when you feel like sexin'
See, part of me is high off the affection
But all of me is high off this connection
Just promise me that you won't disconnect
And if the signal start to fade, you better hit me with a text
And every time you gone I be thinkin' 'bout the last time
Until the next time

[Hook]
I'm in love with this moment
I'm in love with right now
So baby, come hold me
Baby, come hold me down
Wherever you're going
A part of me will be with you
How do I know this?
'Cause I can see the me in you

[Outro]
Everywhere you go
And everywhere you were
And everywhere you go
And everywhere you were
And everywhere you go
And everywhere you are
I can feel your love
You ain't really far
