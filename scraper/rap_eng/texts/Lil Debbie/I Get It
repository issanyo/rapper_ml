[Intro]
Woo!
Woo! Woo! Woo!
I finally get it!
We finally get it!
We finally get it!
Woo!

[Verse 1]
We just show and prove
Your fucked up bullshit
They be saying all my bitches in the building
Looking like a lituation
Liquor in my system, misbehavin'
Kush be hella potent, I be Asian
But I still see through these phony hoes
They be tryna pose with my eyes closed
Made moves, kept it on the low
Where we 'bout to go only God knows
Nose clean and my hands stingy
But they fuck with me 'cause I kept it cold
Bitches talking 'bout their new shit
But I'm the blueprint, hoe, respect the mold
Ten blunts with a few cups
Couple powder pills, it's a overload
But I still whip it, I don't swerve
Bitch, don't trip 'cause I know the road
These hoes like pot holes
So I kick my shit into overdrive
Fuck all them fake hoes
How to kill 'em off so they know we alive
Inhale, exhale, we win
They feel if they fuck with my clique
I kick their head, we real, they fake
'Cause they fuck with my shit
Yeah, they fuck with my shit
But they can't fuck with my shit
Mad they ain't touching my shit
Secretly loving my shit

[Pre-Hook]
I get it, I get it, I finally get it
'Cause I'm on a whole another level
And they can't get with it
I get it, I get it, I finally get it
'Cause my shit is moving
They snoozing so now they're my critics

[Hook]
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, get it)
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, ay)
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
I finally get it, I finally get it
I finally get it, I finally get it

[Verse 2]
I live to get high
You just gettin' by
Just look at my eye
If you come and kiss me then you living to die
Chill, it's just entertainment
Why these bitches be so borin'?
Just when I cop some foreign
I'm in the cut Neosporin
Most of these bitches be amateur
I'm like a vet in this bitch
Bitches be talking, I'll damage 'em
Come get a vet for this bitch
Money on 51/50
I'm like a check away from schyzo
Speak on the queen by all means
But then throw some respect on my shit though
Already know that I big blow
Already fill me a bigger cup
Bitches ain't lying, I live it up
Dripped in all black, but I'm lit as fuck
Eating so much, hoe, I got the itis
Gold on my touch hoe, I got the Midas
Blow is so cold I'm like sick of sinus
Head in the clouds you can see the flyness
I got the key to my city though
Bitches so petty it's pitiful
Changing the game from a different lane
Still they can't see that I'm critical
I finally get it
I'm finally getting my racks
I'm only fucking with facts
Now I'm just padding my stacks

[Pre-Hook]
I get it, I get it, I finally get it
'Cause I'm on a whole another level
And they can't get with it
I get it, I get it, I finally get it
'Cause my shit is moving
They snoozing so now they're my critics

[Hook]
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, get it)
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, ay)
I finally get it (get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
I finally get it, I finally get it
I finally get it, I finally get it
