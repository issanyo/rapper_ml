[Intro]
Alright
Alright, alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Word to mama, ain't no chitter chatter
Funny bitches think they really matter
Money stacking, need to get a ladder
Still stacking, need a bigger ladder
Still stacking, need a bigger ladder
Still stacking, need a bigger ladder!
Blunts getting fatter, stacks getting fatter
Bitches looking, watch me as I pass ya
I'm just laughing at you tryna stunt on me
Bold bitches try to say they coming for me
All my real bitches, roll a blunt for me
Really, tell me what these bitches want from me
Bitches hating, for the fact I style on 'em
Drive in front of Benz, the bitch gon' pile 'em
Now I got it, bitch, I'm 'bout to wild on 'em
Fuck you haters mugging, got a smile for 'em

[Hook]
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up on you bitches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up on you bitches, bitches, bitches

[Verse 2]
Word to mama, ain't no tricking on 'em
Lame bitch know we picking on 'em
Treat these bitches like a toilet bowl, hoe
Sitting on 'em then I'm shitting on 'em
Just a bunch of hoes we don't know
Bitches rapping but they won't blow
Think we playing with them, oh no, no
I be everywhere these hoes won't go
Motherfuckers come and tryna wipe this
You ain't never seen a Becky like this
Not too many Becky bitches bite this
But now I couldn't check a mic like this
League of my own (league of my own)
Bitch of my own class (bitch of my own class)
Still in my thong (still in my thong)
Hoe, kiss my whole ass!

[Hook]
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up on you bitches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up for the riches
Racks stacked up on you bitches, bitches, bitches

[Verse 3]
I been on the same shit, bitches
Stuck up on the lame shit, prolly
Reading for the same script better
Stay up on my lane, bitch layer
Home like I [?]
Ass that you can't miss
Money that I can't miss
Style that you can't diss
Got my hands on cash, now it overflow
Sure a shawty like hold for four
Hating ass bitches even know for sure
That I'm handing out L's like Oprah show
League of my own (league of my own)
Still got the last laugh (laugh)
Still in my zone (still in my zone)
Hoe, kiss my whole ass!
