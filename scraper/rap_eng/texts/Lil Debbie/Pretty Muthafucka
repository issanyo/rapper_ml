You ain't never catching me
Pimping to the third degree
All up in this bitch
Doggin hoes, that's my pedigree
Pucci to the ground
Fuck it, I'm a thrift ho
A-Life to the ground
Bury me a rich ho
You know the name
Debbie or it's Debbie cakes
That's on the bay
I'm a mack, like Ruby Rey
Codeine in the cupboard
Bouncin' like some rubber
Everybody know, I'm a pretty muthafucka
Roll up that swisha
I'm so hot believe us
Head so in the clouds
That I'm head-butting Jesus
Oh, oh, My Jesus
Oh, oh, My Jesus
Vince gave mew that shine
Now mama watch me get this

I'm moving weight, and I ain't talking bout no fitness
All these haters gotta get it, Got these bars like Saint Quentin
I'm moving weight, I ain't talking about no fitness
All these haters gotta get it, Shout it out if you feel it

I'm a pretty muthafucka
Stunt like no otha
All about my bread
Pockets fatter than a Hummer
Codeine in the cupboard
Bouncin' like some rubber
Everybody know, I'm a pretty muthafucka

I'm pretty, pr-pretty work it bitch
If you pretty, pre-pretty work it bitch
Ay I'm pretty, pr-pretty work it bitch
If you pretty, pr-pretty muthafucka


Oakland till I D.I.E
Sat on the side of me
Frisco gotta rep it
And goddammit Richmond make em see
The Bay, the bay, the bay, ay
Run it back
The yay, that shay, that's 40 short, holla back
Beep beep, the general, Jay stylin' on em'
YSL vision, Gold get to dripping
Fubu make it new, How I do on the realness
And finess with that ease, On that car- poster shit
Damn right them used jeans
Yeah real talk, Them used jeans
Got more jewels than ghosting
I'm so seen, you unseen
Muslin, ay, I'm so mean with this in-scene
And I rock it till pure perfection
This for you, this for you, If you out there flexin
Ain't gotta tell them nothin
Cause they know, yeah they know, yeah they know


I'm a pretty muthafucka
Stunt like no otha
All about my bread
Pockets fatter than a Hummer
Codeine in the cupboard
Bouncin' like some rubber
Everybody know, I'm a pretty muthafucka

I'm pretty, pr-pretty work it bitch
If you pretty, pre-pretty work it bitch
Ay I'm pretty, pr-pretty work it bitch
If you pretty, pr-pretty muthafucka


Oakland till I D.I.E
