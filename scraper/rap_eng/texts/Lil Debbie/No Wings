[Verse 1]
I got a feeling, I just touched a million
Kushy got me going, I could touch the ceiling
When I kill it, same difference, I'm just feeling different
Mo' money, mo' problems, we just kill 'em different
But we still efficient
Bitch you know I'm fly no wings
Only married to the motherfucking money, bling, bling
I ain't looking for attachment, we can fuck with no strings
I ain't looking for a piece, bitch I want the whole thing like ya
I'ma show 'em ain't no question who the baddest out, ya
Bout to give these bitches something to be mad about, ya
Bout to show them ain't no question who the smartest out, ya
We be cruising even though we took the hardest route, ya
They know who the boss (yeah), foreign grill exhaust (yeah)
Everyday I floss (yeah), hygiene never off (yeah)
Like to turn 'em on, got 'em saying take it off (take it off)
I just tell 'em buckle up, cause we taking off (taking off)

[Chorus]
Cause I be flying no wings on
Everybody wanna hit the ting, ting (yah)
Only answer to the money ring, ring
And the city hold me down, favorite sound ching, ching (ching, ching)
Cause I be flying no wings on
Everybody wanna hit the ting, ting (yah)
Only answer to the money ring, ring
And the city hold me down, favorite sound ching, ching (ching, ching)

[Verse 2]
We are not alike, we are not the same
I be high as fuck, you stuck in a lane
I'm so high about your bullshit, I don't hear a sound
I'm so fly your bitches bullshit can't bring me down
I don't like to fuss, I just like to flex
Fucking up the game, now that's my type of sex
Got to hustle, bitches didn't even break a sweat
Your man looking, breaking necks
I got that feeling that we popping, we popping
Each day a movie and I know they watching, they plotting
I'm too addicted to this flying, my only option
These haters got so much in common, so no responding
Bitch my moves do the speaking
My trees do the reeking, everyday a celebration
Every night is like the weekend
We be overseeing, we be Sandy Beaching
Bitches always talking, get to pressing, they retreating
Fuck a reason, it's my season

[Chorus]
Cause I be flying no wings on
Everybody wanna hit the ting, ting (yah)
Only answer to the money ring, ring
And the city hold me down, favorite sound ching, ching (ching, ching)
Cause I be flying no wings on
Everybody wanna hit the ting, ting (yah)
Only answer to the money ring, ring
And the city hold me down, favorite sound ching, ching (ching, ching)
