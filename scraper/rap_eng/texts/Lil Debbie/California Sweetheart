Honey bun, sugar plum
Yummy, yummy, yumkin
Gum drop, snookums, snookums
Gum drop, snookums, snookums

[Verse 1]
You can't tell I'm a sweetheart?
You seen my rosey cheeks
Got a sass kinda like a jolie
Lean cup, well we ain't gotta speed
Fine like that parking ticket
West bitch, Cali dreamer
Skinny bitch to a lot of hoes
But to some motherfuckers, ass like Serena
Same game, Oaktown
You can be my [snookums, snookums]
Bay stay, Dago shit, take that trip
[snookums, snookums]

[Hook]
California sweetheart, sweet purple soda
Baby pink sippin', cherry paint drippin'
California sweetheart, bubble gum soda
Baby pink sippin', cherry paint drippin'
I'm your California sweetheart
I'm your California sweetheart
I'm your California sweetheart
I'm your California sweetheart

[Verse 2]
Sweet like candy, palmtree blaze
We tippin' on the Golf coast
That macdray knockin the whip, right?
Like canday soup we the sunshine
We, we shinin' though
Venice beach, our summer flow
Coastal with the baddest hoes
Hungry hit the roscoe
We smoking on that kills shit
Scoring, shut ‘em down like I am Kaepernick

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ain’t hard to tell
Where i be, just pass the sizzy
For these lakers, lob city
Imma die just like berry
Hold up, we drive slow
Looking for those ratchets
This weather be active
My pool look like a pageant
Cuz bitches cold
I represent the West Port
And I’ll be your Cali Sweetheart

[Hook]
