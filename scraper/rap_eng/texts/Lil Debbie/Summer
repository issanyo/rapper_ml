[Verse 1]
Ten toes down, head is in the sky though
Name another bitch going hard as I go
I been on my job, ain't no suit and tie though
Blow a million in a day, before I fucking die hoe
Go bigger, pouring up the liquor
Toast up to the dreams, that we done seen
And going bigger, go figure
Stone cold killer, only OG in my swisher
In my city I'm a pillar, pillar, pillar

[Hook]
Mind in a daze, feel the fade, it's a ganja
Bitches throwing shade, that can wait for the summer
I'ma misbehave, 'till I'm paid, see the honker
I've been on a wave, on a wave, cowabunga

[Verse 2]
Name a bitch that's tighter, name a pool that's colder
Ass getting fatter, pocket's getting swoler
Just another way to say I'm going bigger
Vision getting clearer, still ain't never sold
But still a stoner!
All my flows be popping, all my shit is harder
Circle for the winners, all my hoes be proper
Started with a vision turned it to a dollar
Tried to shut us down but now we got the power
Blunt in my left hand, Henny on the other side
Shaking what she gave me, yeah I got it from my mother side
Now we moving, city on my back, they screaming let me ride
Haters used to bet they bottom dollar, holla, let me slide
Fuck that!
Bitches run they mouth, but we can't hear 'em out
Death to all you bitches who ain't with us, how I feel about
Anyone who doubt us, go without us, see we necessary
Bitches ordinary, and we nothing short of legendary
I been in the kitchen, whipping shit to get your head blown
I been in the trenches, thirty inches in the red zone
Touchdown, touchdown
Pass another swisher, I could bust down
Looking for the winners, look at us now
Real Shit!

[Hook]
Mind in a daze, feel the fade, it's a ganja
Bitches throwing shade, that can wait for the summer
I'ma misbehave, 'till I'm paid, see the honker
I've been on a wave, on a wave, cowabunga

[Verse 3]
They either love me, or they hate me for it
Hope there ain't a issue cause you know we for it
Bitch I never been a sucker how you paint me for it
Same business only difference is they pay me for it
Swaggin' only taking wins, I think you best be in
All we talk about is balling like ESPN
I could probably start a riot, full of fly shit
I'm the motherfucking pilot
Now my diets vegetarian
More green, bitch we eating, give me more green
Blow green, double cup, fill that slow lean
Different city, still winning like the home team
Nothing changed, still shitting on your whole team
Lord!
And I ain't even wanna have to do 'em like that
I react, bitches hating when you moving like that
I just found too many ways to say I'm running that shit
Hands up, like I brought a fucking gun in this bitch
Now you see me though

[Hook]
Mind in a daze, feel the fade, it's a ganja
Bitches throwing shade, that can wait for the summer
I'ma misbehave, 'till I'm paid, see the honker
I've been on a wave, on a wave, cowabunga
