See the queen and the team on my side
Got my ho's and they're down for the ride
All my queen's fuck away, it's a tie
Can't relate to the real, it's a five

Hate to prove, team strong
Kush clouds, green blow
Bitch so high, all team gone
Circus small, many long
Hate to prove, team strong
Kush clouds, green blow
Bitch so high, all team gone
