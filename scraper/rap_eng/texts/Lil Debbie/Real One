[Verse 1]
Uh
I just want that real love
But I can't even feel love
Our heart cold, better chill love
You tried to play me, put it still love
With so much fake love
That won't give it but you take love
That only show up when we make love
That's what made me hate love
Heartbreak love
Say "love" when it ain't love
Can't stay love, when you're scheming go and taint love
Fuckboys fuck good girls make 'em tough girls
Turn around make good guys wanna fuck girls over
Can't trust girls, 'cause the thirst real
Can't get past passed pain when it hurts still
The feelin', being broken is the worst feel
I don't think I really want love but I search still

[Chorus: Sonyaè Elise]
I've been up before, I've been down before
I done shed some tears
I done did some right, I done did some wrong
I ain't got no fear
Had to live with myself every day and night till I realized
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize, yeah
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize

[Verse 2]
I dated ballers, to actors and entertainers
But it's gonna take more than money to entertain her
I'm sick of passion for moments with different strangers
I'm gettin' better at tryna control my anger though
My love languish is basic, don't want a phony love
I ain't really fuckin with that fuckin "be their homie" love
So if you say it, them actions, they better show me love
Better come correct, 'cause I ain't scared of being lonely love
I just wanna look and see the truth in your eyes
Then only wanna see the proof, keep the lies
I don't need much rough sex and good vibes
I just wanna be the main dish, no sides
Hoes come and go, a real bitch is a lifer
So if you find the one, then you won, better wife her
And keep that shit a hunnid
'Cause if you ain't a hunnid I don't want it

[Chorus: Sonyaè Elise]
I've been up before, I've been down before
I done shed some tears
I done did some right, I done did some wrong
I ain't got no fear
Had to live with myself every day and night till I realized
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize, yeah
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize

[Bridge: Sonyaè Elise]
You should try and be yourself sometimes
Everybody else is already taken
You should go and live your fuckin' lines
No one gonna live mine

[Chorus: Sonyaè Elise]
I've been up before, I've been down before
I done shed some tears
I done did some right, I done did some wrong
I ain't got no fear
Had to live with myself every day and night till I realized
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize, yeah
I don't apologize, I don't apologize
I don't apologize
