[Verse 1]
Livin' my life like it's golden
Look at my wrist and that motherfucker frozen
Got my city on, now that mothefucker's rollin'
Look at my pockets, motherfucker's on swollen, bulging
Look at my motherfuckin' time, different days
Same gang, G's up, hoes down, let 'em drown
'Cause whatever we do, we do it flawless
Bitch, I'm going big, as big as Christopher Wallace

[Hook]
Bitch, I stay high, high as fuck
Roll another backwood fired up
I'm high, uh, what's up?
Grew up in the city and they ride with us
'Cause I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
What'chu mean, what'chu mean, hoe?
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
I'm the queen, I'm the queen
What'chu mean, what'chu mean, hoe?

A lotta talk but I know these bitches really love us undercover
Fuck the game, I don't need a rubber
Bitch, I'm on your shit with my Polo fit on
Turned off bitches, how you know your shit's on
I ain't got time for what broke ass bitch on
I 'on't fuck with you haters, treat a bitch like Big Sean
I 'on't give a fuck, I just get a blunt
Then I lit it up, I'm just turnin' up, livin' how I want, hoe

Then I sip it up, boss bitch, what the fuck I gotta [?]

[Hook]
Bitch, I stay high, high as fuck

What'chu mean, what'chu mean, hoe?

[Verse 3]
In the function and you know what's up
Bottles by the dozen, I don't need a cup
Haters on the menu, watch me eat 'em up
Lookin' at my circle, all I need is us
All we do is get sprayed, bitch, hit the snack tray
Twenty bad bitches, and her roaches in my ash tray
Blunts burn slow, money get it in the fast way
All I know is hustle, I'ma do it till my last day
Bitch I run my shit, like a boss ass bitch would
Way too cute to talk shit, spit this good
I ain't got time for what a broke ass bitch say
I don't fuck with you haters, treat a bitch like Kanye
I don't give a fuck, I just get a blunt, then I split it up
I'm just turning up, living how I want hoe
I don't give a fuck get a double cup, then I sip it up
Boss bitch tired of fucking with you dumb hoes

[Hook]
Bitch, I stay high, high as fuck
Roll another backwood fired up
I'm high, uh, what's up?
Grew up in the city and they ride with us
'Cause I'm the queen

I'm the queen, I'm the queen
What'chu mean, what'chu mean, hoe?
I'm the queen, I'm the queen

What'chu mean, what'chu mean, hoe?
