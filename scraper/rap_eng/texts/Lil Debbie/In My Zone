[Verse 1]
Went and copped a foreign, I don't need a rental
Spazzing over every fucking instrumental
OG by the LP, yeah, that's for the men up
Swimming with the sharks and bitch you just a minnow
Ain't no invitation but my life a party
Come in getting served and talking to anybody
Kicking by the pound you can't shake us down
Making all my rounds I don't make a sound
All I ever do is focus on the mulah
Hoes be over here because I do it cooler
Throwing money in the air
No one said that life is fair
Bitches in that billions, I'm the living proof
Talking 'bout my ceiling dropping got a roof
Effortless, everything is effortless
I do what you bitches wanna do and get a check for this
It's excellent

[Hook]
They just tryna get me out my zone, out my zone, yeah
Busting down the zone now I'm blowing, yeah, I'm blowing, yeah
I'm in my zone, in my zone, what you want, yeah
Taking off, got this gun, yeah
I got what you need, yeah (That's how we roll)
Lick the pills and weed, yeah, yeah  (That's how we roll)
I just do my thing, yeah (That's how we roll)
All my real ones do the same, yeah (That's how we roll)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I just want the paper, you can take the change
Kushy got me higher than a paper plane
Bitches play your lane 'cause we ain't the same
I can change the weather, I can make it rain
Even when it's sunny, catch me throwing shade
Turn up with no ceiling, we don't know behave
We ain't gotta show it 'cause you know we made
We ain't gotta show up but you know we paid
Tell me what it look like, add it to the hitlist
Stressing over bitches, bashing bad for bidness
And I'm about my B.I. ever since I'd knee-high
In my city you 'gon see why I got stripes like my Adidas
La vida loca, I'm a real live smoker
Might just put that on, yeah, yeah that super soaker
If you taste that chocha, have 'em hooked like Sosa
I supply that coca, same bitch, just doper

[Hook]
They just tryna get me out my zone, out my zone, yeah
Busting down the zone now I'm blowing, yeah, I'm blowing, yeah
I'm in my zone, in my zone, what you want, yeah
Taking off, got this gun, yeah
I got what you need, yeah (That's how we roll)
Lick the pills and weed, yeah, yeah  (That's how we roll)
I just do my thing, yeah (That's how we roll)
All my real ones do the same, yeah (That's how we roll)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
