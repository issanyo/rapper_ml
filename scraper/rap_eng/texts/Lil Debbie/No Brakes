[Verse 1]
Pedal to the metal, no brakes bitch
Debbie going hard as a motherfucker
Grams of the nuggets, no shake bitch
Blunts hitting harder than a motherfucker
Smoking that, better get it right
Roll another one, can I get a light?
Pack another bowl, if you need a pipe
We just turning up, now this living like
Catch me in the cutty
Got my bitches in the zone, or two
Warning you, everything I do I'm known to overdo
I don't hit the brakes, and never stopping at a red light
Rearview watching, all I see is fucking headlights
Zero to a hundred real quick, real shit
And bitch I'm higher than a 747
Still hitting, bitch, I blow
Damn right I'm fucking smoking
Fifty dollar blunts I'm rolling
Just to show them, now you knowing

[Hook]
No brakes
Cause we ain't stopping, no
All I do is go, it's on and popping
Motherfucker, no brakes
I see you watching ho
All we do is work and we just clock in
Motherfucker, no brakes
We just blowing up
Racing to the money, ain't no slowing up
Bitch, no brakes
Now it's going up
Living how I wanna
Motherfucker, we ain't stopping, no brakes

[Verse 2]
Pedal to the metal, I ain't stopping for a second
Blowing on that Northern California, yeah, I'm repping
Took you down to Southern California, got them faded
Yo, I'm smoking on the daily, but I'm all about my papers though
Made a couple grand for showing up, because I made it so
What the fuck you think you 'bout to tell me, I ain't heard before?
What the fuck you think you 'bout to tell me, I don't fucking know?
Bitch, don't fucking know
Bitch, I did it my way
My way, a buck fifty on the highway
This fly way, every day is like a Friday
Three dabs, still blowing, that's a high way
Okay, catch me on the road, Debbie smoking on that Cheech and Chong
If I'm ever rolling, best believe I brought the weed along
Circle full of bitches 'bout the business, no fakes
And we gunning for the money, motherfucker, no brakes

[Hook]
No brakes
Cause we ain't stopping, no
All I do is go, it's on and popping
Motherfucker, no brakes
I see you watching ho
All we do is work and we just clock in
Motherfucker, no brakes
We just blowing up
Racing to the money, ain't no slowing up
Bitch, no brakes
Now it's going up
Living how I wanna
Motherfucker, we ain't stopping, no brakes
