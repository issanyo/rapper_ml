[Blokka $olo]
BLACK HEART SHAWTY!

[Hook]
Woke up in the morning and I smoked a hundred blunts
Only want the bag, fuckin sack, and no fuss hoe
Bro I need that very cherry kush, yeah that dangerous
I stay high til I die, pussy boy you can't hang with us

[Blokka $olo]
I've been going through this hell still smoking on Bin Laden Weed
Body still aching from withdrawals from all of this promethazine
Momma asked me why, oh why, do I stay high like every day
When you seen the shit I seen, you try to take the pain away
Codeine on the Sprite, my bitch say that shit take my soul away
Trying to quit that shit, cause that the same shit that took Yams away
Creepin' through your hood and we're looking for that killer
Trying to text me, and we might just rob your fucking dealer

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning and I smoke a hundred blunts
Only want the bag, fuckin sack, and no fuss hoe
Bro I need that very cherry kush, yeah that dangerous
I stay high til I die, pussy boy you can't hang with us
Woke up in the morning and I smoked a hundred blunts
Only want the bag, fuckin sack, no fuss hoe
Bro I need that very cherry kush, yeah that dangerous
I stay high til I die, pussy boy you can't hang with us

[Chynna Mane]
You're fucking with the motherfucking set
Been doing this shit since like sixth grade
Need that shit about every day
Need that shit, ain't never gonna change
I said hey man I need that bitch
Mary Jane, I ain't passing that shit
All my street gunners take it like they play 2K
Come through boy, you ain't shit
Yeah, I wake up every morning and I smoke a hundred blunts
Yeah, oh you ain't smoke nothing til you fucking smoke with us
Hit the corner store, cause you know I need me a fucking dutch
Bitch we smoking out, pouring up, being a motherfucking thug

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning and I smoke a hundred blunts
Only want the bag, fuckin sack, and no fuss hoe
Bro I need that very cherry kush, yeah that dangerous
I stay high til I die, pussy boy you can't hang with us
Woke up in the morning and I smoked a hundred blunts
Only want the bag, fuckin sack, no fuss hoe
Bro I need that very cherry kush, yeah that dangerous
I stay high til I die, pussy boy you can't hang with us
