[Havoc]
H-A-V-O-C
Yo, yo
Well it's been about three years since we first met
Now you calling me your dog I made sure you was less
Caught me out there, I deny but you cry
Keep the dough and what about all the times you lied
Understand it's a thin line, between what?
Between love and hate in a young mind
But we only getting older and not getting younger
For you girl still got the hunger

[Coko]
Sexy, tempting
Caught my attention
Knew that he had me in a daze
Oh his styles they tease me
Enchanted the way he
Stopped and stared me in the face, oh

1- [Coko]
But as soon as he said a word
The same old line that I already heard
He disappointed me right away
Cause of the things he had to say were

2- [Coko]
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Tired game and that's such a shame
Triflin', ghetto
Sorry, oh no
Fine as hell though
And that's so pitiful

[Coko]
His lips enticing, so inviting
Smile could melt your heart away, oh
I started to imagine just what could happen
If he should come and talk to me

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[Coko]
Ooh I like what I see
Ooh shorty come and talk to me
Ooh you spoke your first word
Ooh I can't believe the shit I heard

[Havoc]
Yo they need to mind they own biz
Can't a nigga live?
Niggas snitching on me putting in their little bid
I admit I live foul
Met me in the club you gonna find me in the club
Can I get the number?
Won't show a nigga love
I know you want the finer things your man can't bring
I know you looking at my neck
How the shit bling, bling
Just meet me at the telly and expand on things

Repeat 2 till end
