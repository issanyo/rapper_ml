[Intro: Havoc]
Uh, yeah
Yeah
Here we go

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Yeah my lyrics like a hand missile
But you're the elephant in the room, I can't miss you
The drama let me consume, I had issues
You went against the grain, that ass bit you
Ya niggas so basic, face it, time wasted
Cook it, cut it, all in your flow, you're not caking
Me on the other hand, something's always in the oven
Fuck out the kitchen, waiting 'til this shit is finished baking
You can smell it outside the crib, that money scent
Never believe a ho when she tells me she love me bent
I been around the block a few times
My passport tatted, every song a cinema with new lines
Mashed an inch, clap your face, applaud you
Standing o, catch a case but i'm cordial
They criticize what i'm spitting, show 'em what i'm going through
Nigga hide from their passport, shots when they haunt you

[Hook: Havoc]
I can only be me though
Who the fuck you try to be though?
These bitches love me for me and give me deep throath
Niggas hating, she just being what she be though
Being me and getting paid for it
Get out of pocket and somebody got to pay for it
I never force it or lay for it
This shit will probably save your life, put a cape on it

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Savage with it, you average with it
I Master P this shit, you know I never had to live it
Never will, bet a mill, ya niggas broke
I'm the eighty ninth key, so on a different note
We turn white into red carpets
But this ain't a photo app, your money is photo shopped
I teach 'em to hold the block, I don't rock
I over rock, them hammers over stocked
Yeah shots go off, i'm hot homie, police want to stop my course
Shorty open, all she wanna do is drop them drawers
Like a sequal that everybody waiting on
Highly anticipated, you love me reciprocated
Never capitulated, stay 'til it's situated
Got on with sick enslaving, ya faked it and never made it
The pressure will have 'em caving, the omen just called a day in

[Hook: Havoc]
I can only be me though
Who the fuck you try to be though?
These bitches love me for me and give me deep throath
Niggas hating, she just being what she be though
Being me and getting paid for it
Get out of pocket and somebody got to pay for it
I never force it or lay for it
This shit will probably save your life, put a cape on it
