[Intro: Xzibit + (Havoc)]
(No doubt) Yeah, like this
(No doubt) Ha, at this time, Likwit Crew, yeah
(No doubt) Infamous Mobb Deep
(No doubt) Beatin' down
(No doubt) Once again, bring it live
(No doubt) Yeah, like this

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm on a path not taken bout a average man
Black Sedan my way through pitfalls and scams
Let the whole world know about this Likwit camp
Programmed to ignite on site
So now I'm standing in a whole new light (whole new light)
In an area where niggas ain't tryin to fight (tryin to fight)
I feel my jaw get tight (jaw get tight)
It's like these niggas get pumped up, and lick shots
At you and yours, plus the motherfuckin' cops
We got, blocks and blocks of non-stop hustle
21 backdrop, it's my turn to shuffle
Stay alert, little pussy on the side can't hurt
Wear protection from the heat so I don't get burnt
I got no time to be a star...
I go straight from the car to the bar, and then get busy
Whenever provoked, I react like Bill Bixby
Incredible heat, X-to the-Z and The Infamous Mobb Deep
Take it to the street
Don't waste my time (waste my time)
Trying to disrespect me in your half-assed rhyme
That ass is mine
Been going down like this since the beginning of time
Eyes may shine

[Hook: Xzibit + (Havoc)]
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Ayo, I love my niggas for that, it strikes back, handle business
Test the realest, stay focused and keep the, enemy near us
Niggas is careless, slippin' up, switchin' up teams
Crossin' over, and gettin' stuck for they +C.R.E.A.M+
Frontin' like the skills, is superb and got the nerve
To get knocked the fuck out and kicked to the curb
That's for you and your whole click
You rollin' thick, more the better
So like a thick bitch, you gettin' ripped, shitted on
Scuffed off a Mobb Deep song
Take your thug off, he had it on a bit too long
Tuck your chain in, you're gettin' yapped
For your faulty karat slum gold Cubic Zirconian ass havin'
Talk about it, be about it
You ain't been doing this, so don't start
Matter fact, keep it movin'
When it's on, accumulate like cancer cells
With advanced sells, leave a snitch dead, son, he can't tell

[Hook: Xzibit + (Mobb Deep)]
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself...)
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next (What's next?)
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself...)

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, I send shots to any man that come too close
Niggas get fold like a letter to ship across coast
Who go? To go against my Militant Crime Militia
Like these street niggas sendin' missiles to hit 'cha
Up from the ground up, son, you get the picture
If not, write it down, take a picture
Botanical exotic shit keep me lifted, somethin' retarded
You fuckin' up my high beefin', don't get me started
Too late, I'm already on your ass
Beat the fuck out of anybody witcha, and anybody that grab me
Move back, we attack like pits locked in basements
Hungry for blood, derangedest
Craziest type of shit you ever seen in your life
Nigga bled to death, standing up, holding his life
Applying pressure to his wounds trying to stop the blood loss
Found laying in a pool of the shit, his own fault
It's P the Exaulted from NYC, you get extremely
Cut the fuck up by scar thieves
Who can't recognize, do I have to prove all the time
Then get up close and personal in front of your eyes
See me dipped and down-low, ready for action, crept slow
Moved on ya enterprise and crash ya stock
Put a hold on your assets and dug your pock'
These National Geographic niggas is known for flippin'
This animal wildlife, surround me I live in
And float through the jungle at night on expedition
I got a jones for that live shit
Survivors of block wars and crime niggas know what I talk
In a black Tahoe, throw it in four load and blow the scene dancin
Doing 'bout a hundred all the way to Queens...

[Hook: Xzibit + (Prodigy)]
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next?
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin')
Eyes May Shine, teeth may grit, and all of that shit
And you still won't step, so what's next? (What's next?)
All of a sudden, you ain't sayin' nuttin'
(You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin', nigga)

[Outro: Xzibit + (Prodigy)]
(Straight up and down, nigga...frontin' ass niggas)
Mr. X-to the-Z, yeah
With the Infamous Mobb, Likwit Crew
Coming live and direct to you and yours
In the 9-6, 9-7, '98 and beyond...
