[Verse 1]
How the hell did you get here?
Was you sent for me?
Manhattan fly, brooklyn bad
Made in stapleton
I wish i had some more treats, girl
Just to trick on you
But this money ain’t impressive, huh?

[Bridge]
I’m a fly motherfucker from around the way
S-i till I die and I say it brave
Make money for my fam, fans out of enemies
And I’m smoother than a shot of Hennessy
[Hook]
Hennessy, Hennessy, Hennessy
If I hit it then you gon' remember me
Remember me, remember me
And if you ain’t too cool to pass by
What you sayin' baby let’s ride
You fucking with the right guy
And I know you’re feeling me
Yes, you’re feeling me, aye

[Verse 2]
What the hell did you come for?
Was it meant for us to lock eyes in this party, baby girl?
Maybe rush to crush
A Young nigga from the slums of the city
Fresh but now the flow so gritty
Running shit, Mr. Mack Milly
You’re lookin' like…
I put that on my mama
All my people say it with me

[Bridge + Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Now, once we choose to, we're gone
Ain't a thing to talk about
You really got me open, girl
Tryna see if you can work it out
All I ask of you is never change
Cause you fly, you fine, a dime
And I’m 'bout to make you say my name

[Hook]
