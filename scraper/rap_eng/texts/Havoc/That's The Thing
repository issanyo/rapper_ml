[Verse]
Yeah, it's all good we on the same page
And babe, you ain't gotta stress let's get your name changed
Everything that didn't kill us made us stronger
Like them panties that you found, you wanted me to call her
And if the shoe was on the other foot, I'd hit the ceiling
Like the audacity of me for playin' with your feelings
I had you going crazy, friends tellin' you to leave me
Held me down and put them in they place when they was talkin' greezy
I never liked them bitches, but I'm not into pickin'
Your friends, that's your decision
Long as they play position
I told you from the jump that it would be a rollercoaster
Don't get that motion sickness on me now, just hold me closer
We almost at the finish line, yeah we gettin' closer
Can't you see it? I can see it right around the corner
But you keep sayin' that you bout to bounce, it's fuckin' with me
But then you say you love

[Chorus]
See here's the thing
Every time I go and turn back around
Pullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down
It doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'
So let's go do it now or never
Cause I been thinking bout forever
You're everything, see that's the thing
See that's the thing

Yeah
I love to love you, hate to love you, girl you get me vex
We argue and then we have that good make up sex
We argue and then we have that good angry sex
Some say the arguments make the sex ex'-
-Traordinary, not your ordinary climax
Want me grab you by your neck, call you a dirty bitch
While you call me all type of wild shit
Pullin' on my chain like a jockey while you ride
You bettin' that I'm first to cross that finish line
I ask if you stupid, you ask if I'm senile
You gettin' me more charged so I start to freestyle
Hittin' you sideways, girl we gonna be a while
Flip you upside, I got you downside up
Doin' squats in your box while you watch every thrust
And I, take it easy on you long, slow, strokes
How could you not want more, girl tell the truth

[Chorus]
See here's the thing
Every time I go and turn back around
Pullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down
It doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'
So let's go do it now or never
Cause I been thinking bout forever
You're everything, see that's the thing
See here's the thing
Every time I go and turn back around
Pullin' me back to the edge, lookin' down
It doesn't matter what we go through, I ain't leavin'
So let's go do it now or never
Cause I been thinking bout forever
You're everything, see that's the thing
