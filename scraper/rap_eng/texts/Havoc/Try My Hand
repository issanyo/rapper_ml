[Intro]
The preacher came into my room and prayed with me; thought I was ill
I'm not here to throw stones at anybody, I just tell it, as I know it
That many people- you know, when you're young, a lot of people want to play with you, but not many want to pray with you
Pray with you

[Verse 1: Havoc]
(I need your love)
I'm the needle in the haystack, stop looking
Be patient, stop watching when the pot cooking
It's almost done, I get it done
I don't let nothin' linger, I finish them
Two birds with one stone
I just wanna get mines, don't have me out here wilin' with the chrome
I don't got love for 'em, it's no room left for it
Niggas snitching and singing to the cops like a chorus
All we got is us
It's too late in the game for misguided trust
It's your fault, they got you in the crib tied up
Burn bridges and now your favors all dried up
Like a drought in the summer, up go the cold price
I don't give a fuck, so I say "Fuck your whole life"
And put the green light on 'em
Take two of these and call the coroner in the morning

[Hook: Prodigy]
Yo, I can't fuck with these bums
They wanna test my aim and challenge my gun
The devil wanna try my hand, but God got a master plan
Yo, I can't fuck with these niggas
Can't fuck with these... can't fuck with these bitches

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Be a cold day in Kingston when I ain't dope
The Rastas'll cut they dreads and worship the Pope
I got the best of all-time verse, my shit quotable
Remarkable rap, I stand out on a tune
Big big tings a gwaan
You just a crumb on my plate, blown away if I breathe too hard
You like a comment on IG, nobody cares
Crawl back under that rock, the giants is here
For the daughters of men
The Infamous master race of hip-hop legends
If you follow the North Star, it'll lead you up top to the state of New York
She never heard talk like this, I capture attention
My gab is a gift from God for you to listen
And learn a new language, bitch, I speak truth
You don't know what I'm saying, you don't understand, do you?
Well, violence is the best translator
Bullets are universal, see now you can relate to a thug

[Hook: Prodigy]
Yo, I can't fuck with these bums
They wanna test my aim and challenge my gun
The devil wanna try my hand, but God got a master plan
Yo, I can't fuck with these niggas
Can't fuck with these... can't fuck with these bitches
The devil wanna try my hand, but God got a master plan
