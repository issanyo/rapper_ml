[Havoc]
Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against me
But is it the Henny that bend me; I be in the zone
Gazing at the walls, deppressed, iggin' the phone
They take it personal, but only a minor few can understand
What a nigga feeling; 41st 'til I die motherfucka (No doubt)
I'm still breathing; you a mutt, son, we full bred
You ain't my dog, trying to infiltrate my clique is you
I get wit you, handle that on a later note
We o'er-dose every day the death is so close
I'm trying to tell these cats, but I let them do they thing
Ready for the bad news 'til the phone ring
Son is dead, now I'm in way over my head seeking revenge, son
Bent, son, on your behalf trying to laugh

[Prodigy]
Check out the drill, dunn, conceal guns, play the hum
For real son's leaning back checking out the action
On the benches, we drinkin' X's
Yo twirl dat shit, while I spark this...
Chocolate, burn it down like an arsonist
Pull out the miz 'cause its time to bring the biz to kids
And blow all hell fire out ya empire
Your livest wire couldn't make my Mobb expire or retire
I'm letting off 'til my arms tired
You sit quiet wit my head full of riot
Our buyers, it's clear for your ear to hear
I declared only live niggas rap this year
'96-I lost my dun; '97-It got worse... fuck it
Somebody out the team, got to get merked
And sat down, you play the background when shots sound off
Flashin' back on how my man is gone
K.B. forever in my memory
I spill some Henny then I keep it moving

{Chorus}:
Yo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this, Rakim and Infamous
Rep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards
And you don't really wanna go against the source

[Big Noyd]
Surprise, open your eyes, peep the foulness, the wildness
It's bug, niggas thugs in the projects, you holiday thugs
Ease up all that illin' and grillin'
Get ya melon lit up, y'all niggas is butt
You want me? I'm right in QB, what?
Where you find me at, sippin' Cognac from a cup
With my heat next to my nuts
Never afraid to pull it and bust
Slug rushes to your head like dust, but that wasn't enough
This one was kind of tough, he squeezed back
Better believe he no longer breathe, black
Fuckin' with these Queens cats
I got dreams, raising my little queen
And nobody gonna stop that
In fact, black, if you come at me, don't come sloppy
All my baby girl got is a papi
To guide her through this world of hatred
And I die to see that she make it
And die to let the next man take it, is you stupid?

[Rakim]
Yo, you wanna come test, son, it's massive stress
Penalties of death, pay your last respects
We harass your rep if you slept or half-step
We adapt to see what we can master next
After sex pass the bless for after effects
Relax through stress, do math and set, mad connects
Cash the check to get assets we blast Tecs
Dealing with the mental aspects in chess
So retreat your troops, if you dunns come to shoot
Get greeted by a twenty-one gun salute
I keep 'em leery of the deadly "7 MC" theory
Soon as they hear me, I release "Lyrics of Fury"
And quick to say a poem that ricochet in your dome
My clique made me leave the nickel-plated at home alone
So I can get the cheddar and be the better trend setter
The 18th Letter forever, what

{Chorus 2X}
Yo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this
Ain't nobody stoppin this, Rakim and Infamous
Rep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards
And you don't really wanna go against the source
