[Verse 1: Havoc]
Is the sunshine in my face?
I thank the higher power for another day
Try to do it better than I did it yesterday
Try not to stoop low stay above the fray
It's an ill world that we live in, I'm a work in progress
Phase one executed, I'm out of the projects
Cause it only take a fool to botch this
I made it this far why would I defy logic
But what got me here won't get me there
I'm focused and I'm on my square
Put it on everything that I love
I would never ask, take mines in blood
They say a prophet loved everywhere but home
No wonder I'm so propelled to roam the globe
I'm outta here, success is the best revenge
And failure's not an option, me and that'll never blend

[Hook]
Gotta get mines
Fuck how you feel about it
Gotta get mines
Find the highest rooftop, shout it
Gotta get mines
Show the world that you 'bout it
Gotta get mines
To the top, the bottom mad crowded

[Verse 2]
They say great minds think alike
And two wrongs don't make a right
Make us even though
Life a bitch yeah I put her in a sleeper hold
Got me saying shit was all good just a week ago
Tried to park up the bullshit but the meter low
Cut the small talk, only tell you what you need to know
Not a follower so naturally I took the leader role
Let the haters hate, couldn't wait to let them see me blow
Look at me now, you can't hold back your ambition
Honesty with faith and no ass-kissin'
I'm on a Hav/have mission, gotta have everything
Bet my heart and desire on the bigger better things
I'm in control of my destiny
And never let the fuckery get the best of me
I'mma get mines regardless
Got it in my sights I'm not missing this target

[Hook]

[Outro]
Get yours, nigga
Cause I'mma get mines
You know if I would of fucking listened to conventional wisdom
I would've made it nowhere out this bitch
Ya heard, we down in these trenches
Get it how you live, nigga
Live how you get it
Let's go
