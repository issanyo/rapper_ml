Sendin' this one out to my city and my team
Get that ring, know what I'm sayin'?
Look around, this the NBA countdown

[Verse 1: Havoc]
We here, this is what y'all been waitin' for
To bring home the championship, once again it's on
The grind, the struggle and the drive
It's down to the wire, it's all on the line
If you don't got heart, then you won't survive
And that's facts, no matter how hard you try
Got my soldiers on the battleground wit' me
This one's for my team and I do it for my city
It's about to get gritty, step into the lion's den
You know what it is, that time again
That once in a lifetime chance, put the ball in my hands
And I'm a make sure my team advance
There's a war in the arena no players safe from
Straight to the hole is where I be takin' 'em
Nothin' but intensity is flowin' through my veins
Against me, you better bring your A game

[Hook: Havoc]
We livin' this, it's about that time
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We livin' this, it's about that time
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this to the die that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We livin' this, it's about that time
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yeah, there's a war goin' on right now, you not safe
You can run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' wit' your head down, scared to look
You shook cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cook
In my part of town, we sweep your team
We not playin' games wit' you, we playin' for keeps
We conquer over power and crush whoever
He couldn't endure the pressure, let me get that
Floor general of the battleground
You shakin' in your kicks, welcome to the haunted house
Now let the whole world witness as we
Mobb Deep on you and your peeps
Until the endin', you better look alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Hook]
