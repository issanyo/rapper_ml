[Havoc]

Yea, that killa shit, that killa shit...

(Verse 1)
Havoc

The best of the best, Queen of the crop
Started from the bottom now my team is on the top, yea
Money over everythin', shorty she's my play thing
Bread that's the main thing, while you niggas daydream
Sharp as a whistle the pistol, you know we stay clean
We don't shoot bullets, the missiles it ain't the same thing
Night time killa shit, your clique never killing shit
Laid pain chips ate it as a kid I m........?
Militant, pharmacist in the kitchen we was whippin' marvellous
Iced-out medallions was the donesses?
You know the hood raise the fatherless
Told us to get em just show us where the target is
Niggas scream real, scream real until their lungs hurt
We kill that noise when the gun burst
You cowards are softer than a nerf ball
What I do I do it don't concern you

(Chorus)

Not smilin' stay wilding' never come
Eye twitching' money makin' itchy palm
Skimmin' on 'em broad day light
O.D. with it 'til the white meet me
Faul niggas we them never fight fair
Right there niggas when they go down
Your worst nightmare yous a clown
Now from the same cloth get them fuck around

[Verse 2]

Stuck between the rock and a hard place
You see it in my eyes look at the God face
Feeling like I'm in a car chase
No time to parley we do it the ball way (all day)
Twenty years plus nigga, gettin' mines I don't got a fuss nigga
Like most of these old heads
Cause we out here livin' clutch nigga
Hood clutch, wishing nigga would rush
They robbin' for it I just wish 'em good luck
So when your plan get chu cooked up
I had you crying when you look up
Guns on your minds boogin'
How the fuck did they get in here
We do wiggin' on you, didn't know you was livin' here
So while you fallen over petty beef
I'm not stopping 'til a nigga is a Guillian

(Chorus)

Not smilin' stay wilding' never come
Eye twitching' money makin' itchy palm
Skimmin' on 'em broad day light
O.D. with it 'til the white meet me
Faul niggas we them never fight fair
Right there niggas when they go down
Your worst nightmare yous a clown
Now from the same cloth get them fuck around
