[Verse 1]
Rain on the check better
Better wear twitch
Come through the blocks leave a nigga trenched
Get on my nerves feds will be pissed
But I won’t say shit like Marcialist
I can walk through Garalas swept through piranhas
One with the mob gangster personas
I am like a movie and I’m all about the drama
Back out fucking with a bitch name carma
Bitch nigga borrow money from a cash site
If you don’t want to die you better ask, that’s right
Half these niggers out here scared
Thought hip hop was dead cause you didn't hear from me
You should have wished you didn't talk listen from your ears dummy
You need to get the fuck over here buddy
Standing on the cloud you better don’t make it open
I’m happy I’m on the grind never goin broke again
Give me every dime carma on most of them
And go on to Kanye rhyme with the toaster kitty’s
Still spitting venom but where shall they go
Shell spit through your denam I bet that man crawling
He’s still talking get up that’s the damn dope
You can’t kill kush where the sucker at smoke him
You her niggers talking shit but what the fuck is that
Where the money at you niggers can’t fuck with us
And it don’t matter how much money you have
Fuck your boy because we free nigga we get you fucking boy

[Hook]
Nobody move nobody move
Nobody burn nobody crawl

[Verse 2]
Having a phenomenal niggers with the recipete
I got your bitch in the back seat blessing me
Why not ain’t nothing else to talk about
Go hell i burn some Marley then I tune her out
The mall way my team here we on deck
Shit you eat there that’s more stress
Beware my clip be on the offense
Direct strength so when that bullshit offset
I’m all set niggers better don’t mess with me
Now get your grave dog and I’ll let you dig it
Ain't nobody out here can do it like the way we did it
Still doing it ya’ll other rappers ain’t living
Rapperfiers its graphic it get’s queasy
Niggers ya’ll don’t want none of this
Bottom line get your chest blown
Stress out like a camp trail get lost

[Hook]
Nobody move nobody move
Nobody burn nobody crawl
