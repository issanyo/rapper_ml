[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got my clique ready, ready for hand-to-hand combo
Palms break him down, Rapper Noyd cut his throat
Don scoop 'em up, ah, Gotti stomp 'em out
Each twin grab a arm, pick this nigga up
Nitty turn his face to me and let me wake him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
It almost took his whole face off
We got the team positioned, ready for face-off
We blitz like Dallas in the Superbowl faceoff
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
And take your life lost, never found again boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah you a sick
Lunatic nigga jump up but got hit
With Macs and Tecs and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga, almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'
Bullets rippin' through the fabric of your shirt, it's meltin' in
You bleed again, you just another nigga dealt with
Intruder Alert! Our house is nothin' like the Covenant
We hold big shit like a bitch hold one in the oven

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yo, if it ain't drama, money or bum, broke bitches
Simple minded niggas, out for Havoc position
That's opposition, wettin' me competition
Suddenly and outta the blue and now I see
Find myself, by myself and rollin' mad trees
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
Distinguish fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life I take one if you jeopardize mine, duke
You're small, minute, got a deck to deal with aces up
You overbidded and in the Bridge you got stuck
This ain't a card game but in perspective it's the same
Put two and two togetherâ€”Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you up from the waist up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
But our beats bangin', got ya whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', 4 pound left ya ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete
Niggas is trash rhymin', totally offbeat
And outta sync with they life, E & J bent tight
Niggas, slow ya roll
Ya speedin', now you bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be macks and thugs, get smacked, show no love
Crush your team like a bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt that'll smear like mud
New York, New Yitty, Queens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the source of course
Bare that ass thug real kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off, cop out, feel the blast
Who on top of boom gat-for-gat
And all the wolves got the drop on you
And let the nickel nine pop on you

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, my crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats blowing outta your back
What the deal with them tough looks and eye contact?
Starin' all up in your cornea, your cornea lack
The look of a true-to-life
Crime niggas attack
Go at the first nigga that front and overreact
Ya get dealt with

[Hook 3X: Havoc]
Dealt with quick
Opposition get melted by hot shit, he felt it
