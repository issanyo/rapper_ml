[Havoc]
Uh Hu
Uh Hu
Nines pop like bottles of Mo, bonin' ya ho
Leave 'em open like a 20 a blow
Feeling to cop more
Rhymes rusty like nails
Spit 'em catch lock jaw
Cook shit, spit it up, sit it on the floor
To prevent lop side I never slam the door
To never get shitted on, don't put my faith in whores
Never let my information leak thru my four walls
Yo they say I'm on some shit cause I screen my calls
No matter if I'm in the right, I'm a probable cause
Keep my stash by the [] while your guns get tossed
Niggas live by the law then they die by the law
Dunn I live by the gat and I'mma die by that
Dunn I used to be the tunnel now we []
Son it's strictly dom bitches never catch me with rats
QB where I took my first H we rep
Never leave the projects and ya'll know the rest

[Hook: Havoc] x2
Nobody likes me everybody hates me so I got to pack my gun
We carry big ones small ones sneak 'em into clubs dun
So you never catch me run

[Prodigy]
Yo you ran, started feeling numb in your hand
Felt something dripping looked down seen your arm leaking
You get excited and start to panic
Lucky for you, ya had your track shoes on and blew it
My gun arch louder than a Doberman bark
Sober you up, challenge your heart, see where its at
I caught this on dude tried to shank me
Stupid fuck frankly I pulled out and left his ass soggy
Keep rhyming on the Ragu can't seem to shake it
Ruger on the left side of my hips for maintenance
I fix all your problems, handle it bitch
You's a Maytag nigga and ya won't do shit
After you shot you got all emotional with Miami
Laying in emergency throw the D's on me
Squealer I thought you was a drug dealer, thug killer
But at the end you kept it realer
That's why..

[Hook: Havoc] x2

[Havoc]
Ayo I leave the last impression when my shit gets scared
Tying to hang with the elite but a nigga got bought
When it's time to mellow out stare straight into stars
Then I sabotage your brain with these last 8 bars
With your ice grill making me laugh on your behalf
Have a nigga skin graph I'm talking out of the ass
Play you like the ave getting bent off, credit from poppy
Knock niggas down when I get like that
So start me

[Prodigy]
I'm putting holes in your body like ya pausing a party
Then drown your open sores with Bacardi
My gun dun step aside the place and make heads spin
Aw shit, there go the Mobb niggas, keep your distance
Fake fucks keep coming out using "Infamous"
I'll say it for the last motherfucking time bitches
Come with your own shit or get stomped and shot
By Queensbridge at the next industry convention

That's why...
