[Intro]

Come here, come here, come here, come here...turn the lights off

[Verse 1: Havoc]

I'm in your mind like a foul thought
Nigga think this shit is funny wipe his smile off
Think you're getting yours but it's bitter sweet
Man down, now your family gotta pick a reef
Realer than it's ever been, police on my social site
We don't talk on the horn, niggas snitching over mics
You can say I'm paranoid, I don't give a fuck though
I don't trust a motherfucker, everybody cut throat
Why I survive longer? I don't move this anyway
Stealth mode, handle wise, regulate
Shit we been doing, we don't leave shit looming
We better at, you know my shit is always improving
On all levels, torment you to [?] you
We ain't them niggas, nah you don't wanna test [?]
So get it out your mind, that's a no brainer
Fuck the love, it's the fear that make 'em obey you

[Hook: Havoc]

All that tough shit is in your mind
Niggas pussy so they fall in line
Where your heart? It was never there
No remorse for them niggas I don't shed a tear
So long live a real nigga
I'm that nigga that kept it real with'cha
Yep, and always will
From day one, all day, nigga
Impose my will

[Verse 2: Havoc]

On it, you know we really on it
You can pick your friends but not the life that you was born in
Up early morning, I'm on my bread shit
As I get head for breakfast
Make moves we break rules I'm over y'all
We on our grind that second nature is protocol
Take notes, sit back let, a pro perform
You niggas sleeping like y'all been shootin' propofol
Keep sleeping, we out here and wide awake
Heads getting knocked off of shoulders they can't find a face
Niggas hating, hope the feds got a case
Catch a case you know we fight it with a lot of cake
That's how we do, that's how we do
My homie passed her off that's an alley-oop
You didn't know this was the winner team
H-A-V, A-L-C and we big

[Hook: Havoc]

All that tough shit is in your mind
Niggas pussy so they fall in line
Where your heart? It was never there
No remorse for them niggas I don't shed a tear
So long live a real nigga
I'm that nigga that kept it real with'cha
Yep, and always will
From day one, all day, nigga
Impose my will
