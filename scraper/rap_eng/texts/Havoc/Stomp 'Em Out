The midnight murder, two cop bodies on my heat
Walk the street with a motherfuckin straight face
Little shorty flip the script, huh
On any punk ass nigga or bitch
The little brown skin buddha sucker, little motherfucker
I dwell, in Juvenile Hell (yea yea)
I got the shit that make you wanna catch a body quick
Fuck em up, bust em down, Queensbridge style
Street corner thug, my title neighborhood partygoer
Noreaga was my idle (yea)
So what you wanna do nigga
My knuckle game brought me fame in the project hallways
I got mad props, for killin cops
Little shorty hood, a little nigga no good
My twenty-five weighs a ton so run
I'm cockin back on your black ass B and it's like that

Stomp em out kid, stomp em out (4X)

Throw on my hoodie, when niggas lit the Phillie
I put a fuckin cap in the neighborhood bully
What now, coward ass nigga - you ain't tough
Fakin jax, I'mma call your motherfuckin bluffrew, wild for days
Burn up the stage like a motherfuckin heat wave
Learn to maintain, less stress on the brain
Niggas try to front, but they know my motherfuckin name
Straight from the Bridge, yeah, you know my style kid
I have you shook like a twenty-five to life bid

[Ragga chatta - can't make it out]

[Big Noyd]
Blowin niggas out the frame, yes it's part of the game
If your style ain't fit, you need to flip the script
And get on it, you might think it's all about that bullshit
But shit get real, with
Representin from the 'Bridge, you know how it is
My name is Big Noyd, stomp em out kid

[Mobb Deep Hook while Big Noyd speaks]
