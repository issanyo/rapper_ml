Uhh, yeah
Yeah, she lookin' right over there
Mmm

My neck, my fingers and my wrist
Don't make me empty a clip
Get a bottom upset and that's it
Make a toast with my dough, take a sip

Plenty cross on the kush, get lit
Talk, phone me up, do it up, take flicks
Look at you so grown and sexy
Pool three, yeah, you top pedigree

So pretty and full of energy
Ass fat lookin' like need to be friend of B
Relax ma, I'm a QB rider
Anything pop off, trust me, it's minor

Provider, hold you down real well
No stress, no chicks caught in a cell
Keep you so fresh that it'll never go stale
You in-house inbox like e-mail, yeah

Ooh, I think I'm gonna like this, baby
Come and tell me more, tell me more
And when you said do it, know you can live up to it
Now here's your chance to prove it
I'm listenin', tell me more

Ice snub, damn silhouette
Get it wet, I ain't even kill it yet
You about the gettin' freaky with a strange
Jodeci and Sade in the change

Little nasty somethin', tongue on my fingers
Let me be your personal trainer
Hey ma, let's get it in, get your weight up
Wanna see how good you look without makeup

Livin' real sick, big with a city view
Mess around we can make a home video
Late night, uncut, ass clap
Blow cloud, take a pull, pass that

Eyes low, break day
Forgot about tomorrow, where's V.A
I know, can't stay
Ma, make an excuse, come back out to play, hey

Ooh, I think I'm gonna like this, baby
Come and tell me more, tell me more
And when you said do it, know you can live up to it
Now here's your chance to prove it
I'm listenin', tell me more

Tastes just like cotton candy
My hands get sticky when we
Sucker ass, niggas just fall off
Fall in love then wanna marry

Not me though, let the games begin
Never ever save me in your cell phone
At the end of the day, homegirl
That's how we win

Your description's got my attention
I think I'm with it just for tonight
No commitment, we just takin' it
Boy, you got this just for tonight

Ooh, I think I'm gonna like this, baby
Come and tell me more, tell me more
And when you said do it, know you can live up to it
Now here's your chance to prove it
I'm listenin', tell me more

Ooh, I think I'm gonna like this, baby
Come and tell me more, tell me more
And when you said do it, know you can live up to it
Now here's your chance to prove it
I'm listenin', tell me more
