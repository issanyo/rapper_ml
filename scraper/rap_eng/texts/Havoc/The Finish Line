[Yell Ell Verse]

Yeah....

I see a Finish line

I'm racing to it like precious racing to
The table at dinner time, until you fix your grind I'll
Be the one to take the shine, scratch that, I'm the
One regardless fuck a 2nd place I go the hardest

I know you hate it, Im the rookie replacement you mad
That I made it, my fragile placement of awkward phrases left
You in the weird phase of the matrix, breaking your spine to backbend
Over a fine line of my rhymes you'll find I'm one

Of the greatest, my brain's a full house with empty stages
The flows mean I dumped in the booth so you can smell my
Feces fragrance, I know you love it, can't judge it, lil
Nigga used to get bashed in public masses of laughs with my dome

As the subject, now who on top laughing at past discussions
Them niggas tried to play me smashed my buttons now I'm a
Broken controller playing call of duty, you got my back
Buttons smashed in so I keep droppin' bombs n shooting

Shots aimed at schematic faggots for blasphemy
I'm sick of all of these demons that keep harassing me
I gotta make it if I don't I'll be a tragedy doomed
To live in a small state where deaths a daily casualty

But that's my HOME STATE.. I gave you niggas what you
Wanted on a gold plate, you UNGRATEFUL BASTARDS
I'll TAKE THIS PLATTER, n throw it BACK
In yall FUCKIN face, ain't no respect for no

Nigga who don't show it back, love lost in my streets
I tried to bring it back, and this the real
I turned my tassle to realize this lifes a hassle and I'd
Rather break the chain so you can label me a master for a

A mass tour, ballin till I'm the new shit my
Sweet sixteen turned to a dirty 32, lyrics
Is for the big dogs this ain't concerning you
Fishing to leave your day job you just a tommy from Martin, every

Time we get to talking jobs, you get the walkin'
You get uncomfortable like talking to a virgin bout
Purging in her vagina you fear me when I'm behind ya be glad
I came to rape the game of innocence, you lil girls

Rappin are you serious suppose to be scarin' us al-
Qaeda couldn't put fear in us I hope that you hearin' us
When I said we the new regime, I wasn't playing, my
Words should show I'm here to stay, Delaware is my domain you

Fucked up leaving open the booth, speaking the lyrical truth
Spittin so hard I busted a cap in my roof, I'm one
Flew over the coo coo its like voodoo how you flock to me lyrics
Potent laced wit dope n coke I mixed it like pottery

Now tell me who's as hot as me inferno's in my arteries I'm
Like the burning bush in the Bible organic royalty
Poetry in motion, I made the perfect mixture
Artistic visualization with words that paint the picture (wiff)

Imma bad boy, you just a hot boy a
Juvenile delinquent with a birdman as your wingman tryna
Cope the hood look, fuckin crook open ya book n tell us
Do you love the swagg or are you overzealous, pics in the mix

Wit the fellas, LCL be the letters don't forget, my
Middle class is dope as shit, no tracks you couldn't quote to friends just
Sit and try to focus in, flow is so ferocious
Its only right I boast this swollen vision of dopeness

To every other artist that's dissing me, you kidding me I'll
Rap circles around you like I'm lacing up a Christmas tree
302 the home state I'm lining up my pitch to strike you
Out on your homeplate, you thinking you so great

Yo girl did the homies, you just a butler for her
Vaginal I'm speaking so irrational while you keep speaking
Practical I'll keep my lyrics factual, giving my state some reach
While I preach n while ya'll vibing I'll be reaching for Orions

Belt, high as Michael Jackson felt when he odeed on
Propofol, know I follow protocol, who's the best I'll
Prove em wrong, when yell ell's in the building know the
Heat is on, (laughs) King me
