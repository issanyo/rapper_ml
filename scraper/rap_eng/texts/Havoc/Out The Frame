[Verse 1: Havoc]
Get your fucking paper now that’s the math
Promote these motherfuckers, can’t even add
So I expect nothing less from them
When the hate come you can dish it out but just be ready to take one
Head shot, body shot, get your shit filled
Like a cavity my hammer like the dentist drill
No novacaine, feeling all the pain
Watch you squeal and squirm, but they never learn
Till a man is down and not on his luck
On his fucking back, soul rising up
To the heavens to the essense wherever they go
I don’t give a fuck, that nigga had to go
Now send you home but the fuck up out of here
Only thing I sheded for them  alligator tears
Motherfuckers always screaming this is our year
Yeah, yeah motherfucker said it last year

[Hook]
We popping off the first time you get told
We play no games, no more games
That shit dead so move along ‘fore you get your ass torn
Straight out the frame, out the frame
Filled with lead

[Verse 2: Havoc]
If it’s not about the paper then what its about?
That’s the only thing you talkin' than making it count
As the world spin getting headspins
I’m laid back, she wanna bring her best friend
After this it's to the grind like I never left it
First to wake you niggas moving like you narcoleptic
To each his own but be ready for the rude awake
Middle of the night niggas putting two in your face
Catchin' a new case is the struggle it lasted longer
Gotta keep it pushing, don’t kill you it make you stronger
The formula avoid the coroner
Paper stash you make more of it
Keep the hammer on you try your best not to get caught with it
All strategic moves all my niggas official
How it feel when you feel it going through your tissue
Try to tell these clowns I ain't for the fucking circus
Dead you niggas get my money that’s my sole purpose

[Hook]
We popping off the first time you get told
We play no games, no more games
That shit dead so move along ‘fore you get your ass torn
Straight out the frame, out the frame
Filled with lead
