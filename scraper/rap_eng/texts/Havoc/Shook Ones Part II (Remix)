Markaveli - Track 4

[Verse: 1]
Introducing CT in this Rap scene
The most obscene you've ever seen
And even though this rap has got stay clean
It doesn't mean I won't intervene
In order to cream all of your dreams
I'm only eighteen but I'm a mean machine
Who came to clean all of you fiens
Fieening for them dream teen queens
Who's more wet clean submarines
Mark Ct is your sweet vaccine
To sunscreen your life and screen
Your bad routine and bad hygiene
To scream on halloween
Mingia let's scream!
(Screams)

[Verse: 2]
My rap barks at exact targets
I'm playing black-jack markets
You whack faggots should listen to your rap artists
I keep my life sexy, condoms in my vesti
You know my spine's hungry
That means I'm back starving
Back with the tracks hard in
I am out my mind when it comes to filling up
My accounts with fly amounts
Might buy a house
Can't wait it to get it
Cause I am BOUT THAT LIFE MY G
My flow unload
I live by another code
My desire will explode
You're thinking that you're an asshole
Cause you fell outta your mother's other hole
Hail mother, uh uh, noooo

(Hahah!)

[Verse: 3]
You don't think that MarkCT's hot?
Why not is it cause my giant cock's
In your blind spot
I sleep with one eye open like insomnia chicken cyclops
Cause I could rest near that croc's crotch
I'm on
So many drinks I dont even count em
So high I fall up some stairs instead of down em
So high call that Armenian airlines
John put me on to tear up his spare time
You're not a legend like Price, move back like his embarrassing hairline
Let the heir to his chair shine

[Verse: 4]
Throughout ugliness my brothers there with me
It's all love and hits my team there with me
Still I'm feeling like an organ donor so many people dying to see a tat from me
Like a was born with some rare pygmy
But come and get me
I'll leave you down somewhere in Quebec city
Or Trois-Riviere whichever is more quickie
See my momma named me Mark Ct
That's synonymous with ominous
I'm in this school to show you what drama is
I'm not in this game to conquer it
I'm here to hear the engine noise
I'm balling with different boys and
Still I rap like Jay-Z when he was spitting poison

[Verse: 5]
My pen game is sick, call it penicillin
Since the sky's the limit
This the flow that could kill a ceiling
You guys are gimmicks , hide your women
Ct's into Virginia drilling
The realest women they feel the villain
I'm fill em with big inches
Even virgins
I lose a leg? I throw a shoe on my third one
Look how easy the words come
I'm the east coast saviour
Why you think they yelling shady when the verse done
Speaking of shady I'm from the city where no ones there
Sinister M-T-L, I came to give them hell
I'm judging gays, I'm judging all you ugly lezbs
Straight residents
My liquor be off the Richter scale
I'm here to intercept passes like I got a pick from the NHL
Live flamboyant until I'm big as hell
And out sell Videotron like I'm team Bell
And Ima keep on rolling 'till I'm big Adele

(WOOOO!)
