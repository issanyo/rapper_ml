[Intro]
Just a little nigga from the mil'
Where it all started

[Verse 1]
12/09/93 7:54, a legend was born
From that day forward
I knew I was destined for more
But I grew up a fucking screw up
Getting punched 'till I threw up my school lunch
Then one day I met a cool slut, who let me have a boob touch
I guess I haven’t changed my ways, (nope)
I guess I’m still the same deranged patient that doctors "claim" is so insane
So I cut off a couple heads and use a coffin for a bed
Does it mean I completely lost it or is it all for atten-tion?
And riddle me this doc, if I hit you with six shots
Will ya time be up? check your wrist watch. (Tick, Tock)
I used to be scared of death, since then we’ve become best friends
And if u haven’t met yet I’ll give you an introduction
Since genesis I been a fearless kid
Don’t confuse me with a pessimist I’m a realist slash atheist
I've been rocking chains since the days of the slave ships
Throwing grenades at those who say that I changed or don’t make sense

[Hook x2]
It’s the trail of tears I been traveling on for years
With sadness and madness mixed wit all your fears
From the ink on the page to my voice on the beat
You stay running your mouth ima keep running the streets

[Verse 2]
I been spitting that dope shit
With more lines than a cokehead
I get high all day,and get low fades
With hoes that go both ways
Y’all looking like fags, I got a Deniro face
And if u talk about swag I’ll turn you D.O.A
I swear I can let out a rhyme for like three whole days
And when I say I will bury you, I mean I will leave no trace
So if you talking reckless b, stop that
Fall back, spit hard rap
From slums where sons get mauled flat for they ball cap
If you need inspiration you came to the wrong place
Keep banana clips by my waist because my click be all apes
I’m killing all of you that hated, said it was impossible
I Came from the pavement while staying a true nigga to the molecule
I’m a lost soldier on the pursuit of happiness
A savage with a mac-10 for all the happy kids and pacifists
So ima light one up until my regrets burn slow
Next I’m coming for the whole world, don’t take it personal

[Hook x2]
