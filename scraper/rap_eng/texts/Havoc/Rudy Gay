*[Verse 1: Wan G]
He say the molly got him sweating? He lying
Wan got him shook, I can see it in his spine
Please check the time, because I think this dude is late
Got the game on lock, no combination to the safe
So no reason to try and unlock me shouldn't even try and crack the code
These niggas bold. If they step to me, their caskets fold
That .22 will make him fade like Rudy Gay, or have him talking through the wire like Kanye
Yo, Wan got them shook. Rez got them shook. Stokes got them shook and he not even on the hook
Wipe your eyes better get a greater look because my Soci niggas wild like the dude in jungle book
Dudes calling me lucky because I stay with the charms. And now I'm feeling untouchable because nobody can harm me
Wan G?
He second to none
Kamikaze when I get to this mic
Me & Rez got punchlines if you ready to fight
Out of spite, I'mma count this cash and add these hoes and find the sum
But, don't forget son. This is Shook Ones

[Verse 2: Rez]
Rappers falling like dominoes, I'm hungrier than after Ramadan
They wanna follow my delivery like Papa John's
They trying to walk in my shoes and don't even got the sole
Flinstone vitamin rhyming, since a kid been stoned
The crowd feel my flows like dykes and braille because my verbs move weight like treadmills and scales
I remember listening to classics, not novels but rap shit
And now I spit pandemics that's having the class sick
So you can play your cards or shuffle up, punch lines you can knuckle up
They be thinking I'm suicidal every line I just be cutting up
Get my point across, they full court and try and guard em
Hoping I fall off, lose my thunder like James harden
I serve enough food for thought they figured I ate twice
These rappers is novice skaters couldn't figure 8 twice
Now I bet your minds blew. They getting four by two'd
Never leave the audience board, dismiss them with minds chewed
