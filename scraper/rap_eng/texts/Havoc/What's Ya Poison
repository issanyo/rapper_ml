[Intro: Prodigy]
Fucking clown ass niggas, man
(Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh)
Fuck wrong with these niggas, man
Word to mother son
That good shit
This shit right here (gotta bring shit back, man)
Should give you strength, nigga (knahmean?)
Should keep you healthy
(That's what I'm talking about)
Word up, dunn

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, my rap taste good in my mouth like Deer Park
For your ears to list-this
You don't wanna miss this, dunn
Don't be a statistic
Keep your rhymes to yourself, we make fools out of niggas
And write shit that certainly'll move y'all niggas
Peace to my Sumner villains in pink houses
From Red Hook to QB, y'all know the routine
We need a movie to show how our life so ill
Every summer in the projects we partied on the benches
A few gallons of gin and Pepsi
Remember party balls (I remember that shit)
That was back in like '90
We used to roll oo-wees, now we stuff Dutches
Bing bust it, what's your discussion
Y'all niggas talk a lot of shit heard you on the tape fronting
I fakes nothing, ya fuck around and push the wrong button
I dedicate my days to seeing you drip blood
Will always love Gambo and Scarface
Killa Black, no man can fill your shoes
Now what's bad news
It couldn't get no worse, so what y'all niggas know about the turmoil
What y'all know about the blood, soil, clothes and little hoes
And the legs of pants, slugs that crack the shin bone
The other shots blast through your left clavicle
Melt switch suits and paint the avenues

[Verse 2: Havoc]
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
Medium rare, raw? Havoc just over done it
And while you sitting there whispering like a little girl
Fuck waiting around 'til the dutchie gets twirled
We going at you, not cause we want to but cause we have to
Revoke situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it at all, then I don't want it at all
Off top serious dog, I'm out for the brawl
Battle to the world, shit I kick'll dazzle your girl
Handle the bitch
Can't? Then take this referral
Hit 'em with the pink slip, get 'em bent to earl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam, you can't search my crib
Even with dirty worms I'ma still appear

[Break: Havoc]
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?

[Verse 3: Cormega]
Yo, yo, my pen is sick like a heroin addict, whenever Mega spits
I exhale preciseness, drug dealer ghetto shit
Sweat in my hand, plus the finger numb from measuring grams
Gun on my waist, in case I see son who wetted my man
I be Gore-Texing to death, rocking ice with special effects
It's obvious that I was destined to rep
Yo my persona is the drama, my Infamous conglomerate's
Considered mad real, niggas feel the Montana shit
Born official, my niggas that's gone I miss you
I shed a tear, see y'all niggas when I get there
Yo my dunn did six years and still didn't hit the strip
I'm waiting on the day, when Rikers Island ciphers incomplete
When I can sleep with no heat, hidden beneath the sheet
And I can relax with my Air Max, appearing on my feet
When I rhyme you enter my mind
Seeing niggas need the excellence
I represent is manifested in the beat
Respect this, like a Lexus Jeep
My technique, leaves my enemies stressed for weeks, vexed at me
Especially knowing my destiny is near
They scared to death of me, they fear
To even question me, I serve 'em like I'm stretching keys, please

[Outro: Havoc]
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
