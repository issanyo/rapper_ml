Now while I stand tough
Somebody tell this little boy to get his bars up
Stepping to the mic to unleash your bars when
You really just lost like a Knick outside the garden
Thirsty for attention, turns out you're straight starving
For females attention cause you get turned down often
They get turned off when you get hard when
You see their name on your dash like violated parking
Alas, the student has surpassed the teacher
While I'm in the game, you can check the bleacher
Report, of course, you need my features
Talk about my views, my tracks have your highest reaches
Tell me life is hard, you keep sucking like leaches
C'mon Amanda Shaun, ain't you gonna drink that bleach yet?
Tell me all my exes resemble gremlins
When last time I checked you never had a girlfriend
And one of mine was your cousin, yup back to that again
Talk about my game when you ain't even got a skill set
Listened to your track, yeah I heard all that malarkey
That's the sound it makes when a little dog's barking
Gave you your name,you'd think you was my offspring
So I guess that makes you the son of anarchy
His library has my entire discography
I rap circles round squares, but he failed geometry
Another white boy with a degree in nigganometry
So we'll racial profile him and call the hip-hop police
You'll get more press than Trayvon ever did
Cause this Latino's packing more heat than Zimmerman
You nothing but a Boy, George
With a waistline that wouldn't fit inside the royal gorge
Balancing Act was an unbalanced track
I played Kobe after Shaq left, team on my back
He's terrified, he's scared, he's shook
Wrote his diss after he studied my rhyme book
Senior year came around, this boy started dieting
Cuz he was more bubbly than cursive writing
Did Goldilocks really just call me soft?
Stand at attention while the general takes them patches off
The commander-in-chief of the PIR regime
You'd think you was a dope fiend with all of these pipe dreams
So tell me now, how are you the mentor?
When I'm the one serving in the border wars
In one year, Reverb and Datpiff
I dropped three EPs if you count Young Evil Pimp
You seem to have forgotten, address me as your highness
My piousness, unrivaled when, I write lines then
I'm the father of sleep, yup, I'm death's uncle
I really hate to bust this telletubbie's bubble
But it seems like he's only looking for trouble
Christopher Wallace wasn't the only one juggling a struggle
When it comes to this company, check the payroll
I'm the creator, I'm the founder, I'm the CEO
Judging from your rolls you got plenty red meat
So what made little dude want fresh beef?
I'm the Kool Moe Dee to your Busy Bee
I'm the KRS-One to your Nelly
Cuz Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Lunatics
Got your head in the cross hairs, pray I don't get a fix
With a chrome .45 on that watermelon dome
Statuses like Tech and Kaliko, Leave Me Alone
I Murder Inc. with every pen stroke, check the Aftermath
You Common as an Ice Cube, no coming back after that
Like Royce told the Dozen, I'm the king of the city
Calm down 'fore I go Fifty on the white Officer Ricky
