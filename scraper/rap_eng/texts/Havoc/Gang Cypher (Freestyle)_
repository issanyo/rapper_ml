Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Sully the Chief God]
I put the gun on the table
You think your life is unstable?
You try to beat me, you're unable
These bitches watch me like cable
I put my hand on the bible
These thoughts are suicidal
But my life is so fuckin' vital
The world is my rival
Said the world is my rival

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
I bought Versace from a thrift store
I don't even want your whore
