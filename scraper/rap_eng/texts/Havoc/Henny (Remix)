[Verse 1: French Montana]
Weed, Hennessy
A little side, baby let's ride
She feeling me, cup full of Hennessy
Baby show me love but fuck me like the enemy
By far baby listen close
Yachy, now we don't do the fishing boats
Steak and lobster, I'm tryin' to surf
Turks and Caicos on the first
24 carat, neck full of golden
Gray and black shades rollin'
Speeding in a European car like I stole it
Coke boys nigga to the top like we told 'em
My nigga Chink Drugz told 'em
Motherfuck the feeling
Let's get these motherfucking millions

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Double shots of the Hennessy
We gon' kill this whole bottle
After this you gon' remember me
Cause now the case of new big guy
Was having your bitch callin' over in overtime a line up
You soft with it, she just want it wild rough
Boss would of took nothing got her riled up
In the zone ignoring everything around us


[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Oo baby you sexy fuck you that bitch
(Hennessy) bottles and shots and we twist
I'm that thug you want to be with
And live an infamous life tore and get lit
Stay away from that basic zone that's not us

And damn I feel no remorse for your ex
Better take it easy 'fore I crack him in the head with the

[Verse 4: Mack Wilds]
Hennessy, how the hell did you get here
Was you sent for me
Manhattan flat looking bad in Stapleton
I wish I had some more treats girl
Just to trick on ya
This money ain't impressive, huh
I'm a fly motherfucker from around the way
S-I 'til I die and I say your brave
Make money for my fam, fans out of enemies
And I'm smoother than a shot of Hennessy
Hennessy, Hennessy
If I hit her then you gon' remember me
Remember me, remember me
And you ain't too cool to pass by
What you saying baby let's ride
You fucking with the right guy
And I know you're feeling me

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Live thorough niggas, five borough niggas
High low flipping cross the tri-borough niggas
Your team look soft, you look like five solo niggas
Respect my shit before I get my bipolar niggas
See how them niggas sound? Yes
The only thing they understand is beating niggas to death
Don't put your hand on me
You see back to the strip we droppin' a bundle nigga
Now get the block and we back inside of the tunnel nigga
See we run it like we was jogging on 'em
Come get your shit like you really just caught a bargain on 'em
Hey hey see the melee we be causing niggas
More hood than the club security robbin' niggas
Providing the fire and smoke, call me the arson nigga
Like when your jail so much cigarettes bring a carton nigga
We cause 'em really to act away while I be clobber niggas
And I advise you to back away when I'm talking niggas
Hot shit sizzle the street, see what we're cooking nigga
Uh, pardon me, uh, uh, we gotta push it nigga
You ain't with it then you can leave
Out the back sorry niggas you can't breathe
Leave me alone and I'm begging that nigga please
Doing that shit that make niggas crash into trees
Mack Wilds, Montana, Mobb Deep
You see them chicks just let 'em know that our city don't ever sleep

You fucking with the right guy
And I know you're feeling me
Yes you're feeling me
