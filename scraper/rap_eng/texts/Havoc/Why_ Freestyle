[Verse:]
Why Grand Hustle start all the trouble
People been waitin on all they artists to bubble
Why the man lookin when you sendin him a fate
Why keepin it real when niggas turn out to be fake
Why a lightskinned sista a dime
Why you gotta be dark for them to say that you fine
Why do bitches gotta be hard for niggas to listen
Why do niggas say that they love, but they be hittin
Why my ladies always hala respect
When a nigga rite, they get signs to reject
Why do grone folks forget that we young and we livin
Why they actin like it's easy to be in my position
Why they never give you a chance, time to advance
Why do bitches take advantage of they momant to stand
Why them niggas say they hard, instead of sayin they real
Why the fuck do I gotta apeal
Why can I do what I live
And why do times gotta be so hard
And why them niggas keep testin the squad
They act like they hard
Why my sister got two different daddies
Will my sister ever find a good man to marry
And why do bitches always hala for dollars
Turn around and get mad, cause a nigga won't hala
And why bitches say tricken ok
That's why these other girls sippin today
Shakin ass, tryna give them a break
And why do niggas get so much respect
And why my ladies gotta break they neck, just to get that cheque
