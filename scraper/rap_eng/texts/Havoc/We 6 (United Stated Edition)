[Intro: Life’s Complex]
One verse one hearse sucka
Look how we came up
Check it, check it
Look how we came up, brother
Look, alright

[Verse 1: Life’s Complex]
Okay we came up
Grew a little bit but didn’t change up
Got a little selfless
For myself I took a paycut
A little less ego coming in with all my paystubs
Riding off a scholarship I gotta keep my grades up, uh
A+ A+ in respecting women
I’m posted at the gates waiting for the bread to leaven
Taking epinephrine for the better or the worse
Except mine is from the body ain’t no need for an injection
Uh, motherfucking microphone monster
The wise don’t divide they attack all and conquer
Complex with the flow, slow motion when I saunter
Know I’m tryna branch out so here goes my peace offering, like
Been in my feelings for a minute in time
I wasn’t kidding when I said I’d be committed for life
And on the real I’ve been fixing to get into your mind
I don’t mind if you stay single, baby, dinner is tight
Up out my feelings, uh
You ignant I’ma teach ya
Cause Miggy bring the heat like a Carolina Reaper
This is lethal, and if you cannot see let me repeat
It’s no biggie to give women all kinds of courtesy
Who actually gives birth to the child?
Women
Who’s told to look pretty by society?
Women
Now what does this add to their lives?
Pressure
Ay yo Convo what’s your size?
Seven
And that ain’t all, shout out Gem of the Nile
If I had money that’d be funny cause they’d look at me now
Man I was hunting for a love that was al natural
I found what I was pursuing but it took me a while
I’m, blocking your rocket no one’s on top of me
It’s so obnoxious how often I win the lottery
I’m talking confidence obviously I’m the man
Stop the cacophony of birds chirping on the internet, like
Don’t listen in or they’ll get inside your head
They plant the seeds of doubt and then you’ll find it starts to spread
It’s naturally invasive to your self-empowerment
That’s just my sentiment, but I’ll get it said again
I’m out my feelings
You ignant I’ma teach ya
And Miggy bring the heat like a Carolina Reaper
This is lethal, and if you hypnotized let me repeat
It’s no biggie to give women all kinds of courtesy
And this is easy
A+ A+ A+ A+, egh

[Verse 2: Vile Diarrhea]
It’s a sad place we live in, disturbing to be honest
Cause it feels like there’s no one out there respecting women
It’s time to sit down and have a little conversation
About this blatant disrespect that's been plaguing our nation
I've got a story to tell, so gather 'round little boys
Stop playing with your genitals and making so much noise
You need to listen to these words that I'm telling you, they're hella true
And they reveal what God has said to do
One day in the park I was creeping on some females
On my smoke break from my job working retail
When I saw a light shining from a woman’s booty
And I heard God’s voice start rumbling through me
“You sick perverted man. Avert thine sinful eyes
It’s misogynistic creeps like you whom I despise
Instead of being punished for your disrespecting ways
Go out and preach the word of feminine praise.”
He had me fetch a chisel ?
And upon a tablet I ? commandments of equality
Men shall not look down upon the pussy
And about intercouse they shall not be pushy
There’s no need to get mushy
But man should try to make his girlfriend feel like they’re the only woman alive
And try to suppress his primal sexual drive
Or else God will cut your penis off

[Verse 3: Big DJango & Big Magellan]
I wanna get to knowing you (I wanna get to know you)
Don’t want to rush to holding you (hold you)
Cause I just want to roll with you (roll with you)
? steamrolling you
Cause baby you just gotta know that I care (I care)
And when you need me anytime I’ll be there (be there)
Cause I just wanna build something we’ll share (we’ll share)
Cause I’m respecting you for life I swear (I swear)
I swear
I swear
I swear

[Verse 4: Mod Lyric]
Yeah, yeah
And now we bring the Lyric in, off beats for a minute
Heard talk of a track, Tic Tac respecting women
Had to come in and kill it, hot verses, had to deal it
You misogynin in the crew I cup your blood and spill it, yeah
Everybody know how fat my verses flow
Had a minute to write it so now it’s mostly off the dome
Tic Tac, we on a mission
New tip, respecting women
We Tac, we got a vision
We sick, no intermission
Be on the lookout, new Tic will get you shook out
Freestyling and wiling, grab a pen and get your books out
Lyric professor, every rhyme a lesson
Catch you later on we’ll free, and I’ll be testing
Glad you heard the new tic, now I propose a toast
To King Miggy the reaper, and Mod Lyric the ghost
Yeah

New year, new Mod Lyric
He’s a brand new guy and he’s doing all these fat raps
God, Tic Tac is so great
SQUAAAD SHIIIT!
