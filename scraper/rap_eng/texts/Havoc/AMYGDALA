[Verse]
Mutilation observing
As bodies are burning
The horrors are lurking
Right under the curtain
And I cannot see them
But I know they breathing
The heat of it seething
Like orgies of demons
Black out my eyes
Leave my body crucified
Crow carrion half-alive
Made up the truth out of lies
Only the strong survive
I'm bleeding and hoping
That I'll end up choking
In fountains I'm drowning
The volume of blood is astounding
Forever resounding
The screams that I'm spouting
You hear them ring out
The dead they bring out
Forever in doubt
Always regretting
The creatures that crawl out my mouth
Leave them abandoned at the cave
Never to be saved
Never wonder aloud
