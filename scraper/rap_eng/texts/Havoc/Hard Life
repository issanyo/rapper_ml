[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Smoking loud with the top down
Burner on me, nigga, come and get me right now
Dope fiends in the hallway
Little niggas'll clap something in broad day
Rose gold, princess cut
Pretty face, little titties, big butt
Thugged out, she with me like "nigga what?"
Big chain on my b-boy
We walk in these niggas get p-noid
Gem star make a nigga face keloid
Our 16s'll have your crew destroyed
LOX them niggas you wanna evoid

[Hook: Prodigy & Jadakiss]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?

[Verse 2: Styles P]
100 shots to the fuckboys, 21 salute to the real Gs
Live by the code, if I couldn't do that a rat nigga'll kill me
24 karat gold handguns, mink seats in the coupe, yes
Rooftop party with the real gangstas, spiral stairs in my duplex
All high and I'm looking at my bitch, and my money like "what should we do next?"
Real nigga 'till I die, if I can't be real I'd rather die, yeah, I choose death

[Hook: Prodigy & Jadakiss]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
By these rich, young, black hustlers out the slum
In New York state, bitch, you could get some
Say ahhh, I'll shove my gun down your mouth
Like what was all that woopty woop about?
Greed is good
I get all this dope shit, you wish you could
I'm in a financial district, I don't do broke Uber
SUV, I send for your hoe
So these are iconic bars
When I bust your head you see all kinds of stars
To see your whole world turned black
What's done is done, there ain't not turning back

[Hook: Prodigy & Jadakiss]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?

[Verse 4: Havoc]
Tie your shoelace, you rap niggas tripping
Fall face first when the pound start spitting
Same old dirt, really ain't no difference
Fuck about a Grammy, they salute me in the trenches
Fuck about y'all, got a give-a-fuck fetish
First nigga feel some kind of way I'mma lay
I could have a beef with the world, never dead it
Your son in deep shit, mama love better pray
With your broken-ass gun, shit, looking like relics
Fear so bad when we see him we can smell it
Room full of goons, lay back with my Ls lit
Son got bagged, real Gs never tell shit
Did 5 on his head and his mouth closed
Came home, hit him off, ball like Gauchos
D-Block, Mobb Deep
H-A-V-O make money in his sleep

[Hook: Prodigy & Jadakiss]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Top down in the winter time
If you on the boom list then it's dinner time
Horse head in your bed just so send a sign
This is dope right here, nigga, get in line
Yeah, I've been a don since Benneton
Before you let a man hit me on the intercom
I find out they did him wrong then I get 'em gone
They on the roof with the scopes, have 'em hit him long
Yeah, we bomb shit like the Pentagon
Where that money go, nigga, what you spend it on?
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?

[Hook: Prodigy & Jadakiss]
LOX is that hard life, Mobb Deep is that real
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
Infamous is that raw rap
You come through D-Block you get killed
Life's difficult, death's easy
LOX, nigga, M-O-B-B, what?
