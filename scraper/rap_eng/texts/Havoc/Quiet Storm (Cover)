(Verse)

My demo bout to drop

Continents get shook-en

Have the game on lock

Holding cell

Like bookings

Few years ago

I was sitting in booking

Now they in email

Tryna get CC me bookings

Come up in the spot

Dey like that's a fly fit boy

Sell a million records

Ima cop the big toy

Rolls Royce phantom

Like u ain't see shit boy

My guards keep

Them hallow tips

Like that Knicks boy

Queens nigga

But I'm in the Bronx

All black attire

Black Tim's when I stomp

Fab on the mic

So there is no comp

And I'm wit the cartel

Vbyz Don't get romped

G5

Used to ride the Q5

Now they tripping

On our feet

Better get ya shoes tied

Tici  air forces

Nigga we 2 fly

We don't fade away

Nigga you die

We not having it

Like some broke niggas

Human torch for real

Enough to smoke like 4 nigga

Matter fact all niggas

Throw me on tour  nigga

But it might

Turn to my tour Nigga

I ain't Blood or a Crip or a Folk nigga

I'm me

Learned that from my folks nigga

I Bugs on tunes

That's all folks nigga

Smile on my face

I ain't no jokes nigga

Words leave my teeth

Sharp enough to 4 poke niggas

Switch it up

Reckless like I'm liquored up

Knocking hit em up

Big in the truck

Sun get em up

And I'm  off the chain

Like give that neck less up

I'll put a L

On ya hood like a Lexus truck

Catch me wit a model

And an extra slut

Breast double cup

Bubble butt

Looking like

She wit that nigga what?

Freestyle ?

Ain't shit free

This mic had enough

Now ima give it back

To Scrappppp

Like he had the stuff
