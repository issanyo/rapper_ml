[A-F-R-O]
One two mic check
Can you hear me now
Laaah

[Verse 1]
Most niggas just like potatos puffs
Rough war tore your rotator cuff
Ain't enough to say goodbye to your siblings
They die the same time as your kittens
Had the man's children camera filming
See the holocaust boy get tossed off the building
Bewildered my environment
My assignment pillars
Of higher diets
Mic sirens
Electricity fuse fingers that give me power
Next simplicity nude give 'em a shower
My tapes stay visionary
My brain waves
Read every page of the dictionary

Bigotry blissfully brilliantly
Busily killing chivalry density
Differently dignity dismally dystrophy
Filigree finnicky physically fit for the
Giggly history imagery
Industry infamy infinity

Infantry went the weapon shop
Military predictably set the clock
Experimental makeshift with the rages
Instrumental phases for your mental stages
Rock shop iller
Non-stop killer
Black gorilla
Shoot the snot box off Matilda
The man greasy
Slap meeting on the flow
My man sam sleazy faded on the gold
