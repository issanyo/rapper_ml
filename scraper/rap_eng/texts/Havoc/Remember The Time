[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven so i did it in
Do you remember back in the fall --- (Background: I bet you remember)
We did it again for all day long
Do you remember our solded hands
And in each others eyes we stared

[Hook]
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time when we first met
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time

[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk
And no we'd stay on the fog that night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said
I just loved you so I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring  --- (Background: I bet you remember)
Every morning you where up and sing
Do you remember those special times
They just go on and on and on ... oh my love

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And I see memories would always be into me
And girl what matters when we say that
I will never forget what we had now baby

[Outro]
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
Do you remember the time (4x)
