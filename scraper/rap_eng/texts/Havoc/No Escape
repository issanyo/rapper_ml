Get home from school
And walk through the door
So stressed from your day
You pass out on the floor
But its not long before youre reminded
Why you hate going home living in a prison
Where no one leaves you alone

Tired of the yelling and being pushed around
Being told your worhtless and letting everyone down
No escape from your nightmare
No escape from yourself
No one to turn to
No escape from this hell

American family, american dream
It doesnt exist, things arent what they seem
Mommy's a slut and daddy's always drunk
And the bruises on your face never go untouched
American dream

Remember your not alone, theres a way out
No room for fear, no time for doubt
Dont let them tell you, youll never be any thing
Dont believe their lies, because they dont mean a thing
