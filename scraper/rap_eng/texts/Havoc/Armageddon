[Intro: Hell Razah]
El-Raziel, sometimes my mind just zone out

[Chorus 1: Hell Razah]
Take you through Heaven and Hell
Let me take you through Heaven and Hell

It's the righteous side of me
Gon' against the wicked side of me

[Chorus 1: Hell Razah]
Take you through Heaven and Hell
Let me take you through Heaven and Hell

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
I'm the sun, moon and the stars
I be the wound in your scars
I'm where the souls and the spirit evolve
I'm why the planets and the orbits revolve
No problem to solve
Cause I'm perfection, the curse and the blessing
No pain, no hurt or depression
From birth it was destined
Since the night they said let it be right
I was the vitamin and the bite in the fruit from tree of life
I'm with Christ and his wife taking UFO flights
I don't like space shuttle, fake satellite hustles
I'm a place where it's safe all your dead aunt's and uncle's
Your great-grandmothers and fathers said they loved you
Be careful of that trouble in that concrete jungle

[Chorus 2: Hell Razah]
I'm the water, the fire, the air that you breathe
White doves in the firmament spread they wings
I was written in the top ten, one of the kings
So when you die you gon' really see what I'm a bring

No man can serve two masters

[Chorus 1: Hell Razah]
Take you through Heaven and Hell
Let me take you through Heaven and Hell

[Verse 2: Hell Razah]
This where the demons at, chicks sip semen at
200 fallen angels leaning on Venus track
I give a fiend a crack, a young black teen a gat
Show 'em how to clean the MAC
Then I want my heaterz back
I gave Eve the apple, the thief in the castle
Deceit tabernacles, goats and half-jackals
Eat like pterodactyls, death forever travel
The puppet masters to the president, whoever has it
I do genetic cloning, slept wit many Romans
With three sixes in the forehead before the Omen
I be the rage of Hitler, I went and changed the scriptures
I even made Michelangelo paint his pictures
I be a four ton tongue kisser
Desert eagle, young gun lifter, blood splitter
I eat the souls of these young niggas
I'm a disease to these drug dealers and these coke sniffers

(Chorus 2)

(Chorus 1)

(Chorus 2)

(Chorus 1)
