(Verse 1)
Survival of the fit
I turn my rivals to a myth
You talk slick like a bitch
I unload the clip
Now you don't exist
If the cops run up in the spot
You know I'm gon resist
Flush the work down the bowl
Then make my exit
Now I'm broke and hungry
Times are desperate
Lift the 9 to his neck
Now his head is separate
Work Ellen
Too many niggas jellin
Cause I'm spitting better than veterans
And I'm only a freshman
Hammer to your melon
Sick in the head
Seen a nigga get shot at the age of seven
Shit like that you supposed to take the grave
Pops was locked , and momma taught me to always be brave
Now money I crave
Nigha you would be amazed
Bullets a knock off your face
If you ain't good act ducking strays
I ain't talking bout a dog
Kobe mentality
Get that Rock Ima score
I ain't talking bout a ball
This year I want it all
I don't got time beef
Cause this world is so small
So if it's lit
It's cool
IMa probably see you tomorrow
I had a wicked jump shot
Still ended up on the block
I had tress, I had e, I had little bit of that rock
See my mans get killed for a dime
Decided it was time to stop
Momma struggling to pay the bills
I started writing I just hope this shit hot
Survival of the fit
I had to hit the gym
Momma threw me in that water
Had to learn to swim
Had to take a couple losses before I learned to win
Real bosses get it by they lonely, I don't need no friends
Cause when I was broke they was gone with the wind
Now bitches and niggas in my face cause I got money to spend
