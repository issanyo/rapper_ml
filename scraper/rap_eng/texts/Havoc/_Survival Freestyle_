[Verse1: D.Hawks]
Dark nights, fingers frost bite, from clutching my burner
Ready to spark on the frog type who tongue flying with murder
Watch and observe me nigga, learn some moves from this thriller
Twirling yellow to some D like a Pittsburgh Steelers Fans,
On in the kitchen cause this heat is ridiculous
These streets is so vicious, its a blessing to make it to Christmas
I gave up scholarships to ball like Money Mitch
Living life 'Paid In Full', pouring Ace out on a bitch
Ain't it a trip, the way I fell in love with this bitch
Tried legit, but that money wasn't making no sense
I want me a Benz, a Bitch and a band of Benjamins
No time for friends trying to fry my ends
Few Amens cause the Lord don't condone him
Selling to unfit mothers and lost grown men
Can't pretend I'll see heaven when I reach my end
Demons inside led me to this sick life of sin
But hold on! I'm a man, I can't blame it all on them
When I love the feel of wet dope seeping in my skin
Don't need a scale, just a eye, a smoker and his stem
And we can turn this town upside down, Inception
Interception, then I'll take her to the house
Like sanders I'm Barry sweet when I'm in your girl's mouth
Unhook her blouse as she bowing south
Nut, then I'm out
I'm to real for them cartoons playing that cat and mouse
I heard the feds on the block
I heard the state on the watch
I heard my Boy just got locked
And stick up kids is on the watch
These times crazy
I'm sending decoys out the house
This can't be what life's about
Finding out who your niggas when indictments rolling out
Its Ludacris, we been down since 'Roll Out'
Now I'm outside your BM house
Like chess, attack the queen if you threaten my power
Cause stress can cause the mightiest kings to cower
Cloudy thoughts Cause your lungs all filled with sour
Getting head from a bitch cause I paid for the hour
Kick in the door, smack bitch to the floor, four to the forehead
"Where's the money and the powder or you're all dead"
He told, no second thoughts under pressure
Fear of the stretcher left his bank account lesser
Now I'm at the Lexus dealer test driving with Alexa
Copping out of state tags, exchanging cotton for the leathers
On to the next one I'm always chasing paper
Son of the dark side you can call me Darth Vader
Skywalker D.Hawks middle finger to you haters
