[Verse 1: Yung Thrash]
Yo game played out like a movie scene
I spilt some lean on my Balmain jeans
And baby a dime she a beauty queen
Wicked for green im a money fiend
Then nut in her mouth leave her too pristine
And leave it to me to come slash this beat
X-men on my list cuz im Wolverine
With a scream mask on like its Halloween

[Hook: MariiSavage]
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk

[Verse 2: MariiSavage]
All my haters bussin like the Taliban
And my sniper stand im finna catch a opp
If my words dont hurt then im throwin rocks
If i peep the head then its body shots
If i see you trappin ima hit the spot
I done lost track of my bodies caught
If i catch you slippin let yo body rot
And i stay with steady you can get some rocks
Make you think its chess by the way i plot
Gordon Ramsey yeah, and i whip the pot
Im a broke boy got me rockin Crocs

[Hook: MariiSavage]
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk

[Verse 3: Yung Thrash]
Drippin like the wrist of an emo chick
Shoutout ???
Im kickin flips and pumpin kicks but no remix to Jaden Smith
Im breaded for excellence got the scope for precision
Im a hitman got a hit-list
Just assume your name is in it
If you switched up in a minute
You just asked for a death sentence
Got the jacket True Religion
Yeah, im a threat, im a menace
Just reckless call me a gremlin
HAVOC came up from the trenches

[Verse 4: MariiSavage]
Yeah, i got the rollie its shinin
Kick her in the heart ima a mayan
That girl be givin me neck, her boyfriend will swear that im lyin
I gave that girl a big L, walkin away while she cryin
And that girl just hit my Dm, leave her on read no replyin
I get the sauce from my mom, had to go bool with the don
Yall boys be hatin on us, haters just leave us alone
Yall boys stay bitin our styles, yall boys be actin like clones
Yo girl be loosin her mind, watch she just stare at my bone

[Hook: MariiSavage]
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk
It's that trap talk
It's that trap talk
If a hater talkin heavy let that strap talk
