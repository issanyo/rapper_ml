We gon' do it like

[Sheek Louch]
Sheek usually white tee thuggin, blue steel huggin
See me with a chick, most likely be fuckin
Neighbors too nosy, chain all rosy
Fresh white Airs, one squirt of Dolce
Coupe all kitted, wrist all glitted
You would think I'm hot in how low I wear my fitted
Dutch already twisted, 'gnac all poured
'Bout to hit the hood and find me a nasty broad
I like 'em with some weight, at least around eight
They don't gotta be a 10 long as they can bring a friend
C'mon, pile in, let your hair out
Reach into that little mini-bar and pull a beer out
Loose, there's cranberry if you need it for the Grey Goose
By now I got my pants around my ankles
Ooh c'mere mama, let me thug you out
Let me whisper somethin to you that'll bug you out

[Hook]
45 minutes to Broadway
I can be downtown, I'm only 5 minutes from the Boogie Down
45 minutes to Broadway
We can come back up to Y.O. where I blow your back up
45 minutes to Broadway
We can get drunk ma, and hang out right in the sports bar
45 minutes to Broadway
Or you can fly to New York bitch, the home of this D-Block playa

[Sheek Louch]
We like "Take it off!"
Do you mind if I take a picture of you and send it up North?
My homey in his cell and all he got is Black Tail
He need a Polaroid so he can let 'em know it's real (ha ha)
And you ain't gotta stay indoors
I got a house key for doin the choors (no doubt)
Chef in the mornin, mines scrambled baby, how you want yours?
(How you want your eggs?) I take 'em to the hood, send 'em to the store
Introduce 'em to my homies, Sheek so raw
It's all fair game, I come back with four more
Don't be scared ma - you heard a lot about D-Block, right?
Well you here ma, let's go

[Hook]

[Sheek Louch]
I don't wanna talk about it (nah)
You keep tellin me your house is crowded (so?)
What'chu wanna move in?  I doubt it (uh-uh)
I'll let you sleep over, use the robe and go get you an outfit
I like my freedom baby, I already got a baby
I lay my game down flat soon as I meet a lady
We can do it up, I don't care if you married
Divorced with kids, I don't give a fuck
