Yea Haha niggas it's 2006 and I'm back in this bitch
G-Unit

[50 Cent: Hook]
When I come through I'm comfortable
49's 45's a pump or two
We don't permit outsiders amongst the crew
Matter fact who the fuck are you

[Bridge - Lloyd Banks]
Cause I, I got to get it got to get it and you can roll if you with it
I got to get it got to get it the world and what's in it
And you can get it you can get it in a New York minute
I got to get it got to get it

[Lloyd Banks]
Rap gone get that boy found in a river
Dead by a trigga thinkin he Schwarzenegger
Fools don't take him I took him across the liver
Keep Lloyd line on my stomach from the sizzler
The drama is a part of the story that I'm a give ya
The black mags and backstabs are so familiar
The knapsacks and black bags are full of scrilla
That lame ain't a killa he softer than chinchilla
And I'm a GT see a 4 door wheeler
Matter fact this summer its 44 4 wheelers
45 on my side shorty ride for his pride
Forty eyes on the prize now I'm energized
Nothin but shiny shit around the neck n rims
Bitches only come around when ya gettin record spins
What a way to double up I'm headin on my second wind
Rollin luggage on the jet I ain't gotta check it in

This is heroin medicine that morphine flow
My gun go off nigga and everybody know
I hold it down with the pound 3n57 ways
Hollow tip graze ell put a part through ya waves
Half Christian half killa half man half gorilla
I pop somethin do a nigga dirty for that scrilla
Now I'm floored D's kick the door
Found me on the floor by my toilet tryna flush that raw
Toilet wouldn't flush I'm fucked
Half a brick of yay goin round and round
Mary J my life I'm goin down
Its sounds like we all came up the same
Nigga I'm for real they just rappin mane
Find out when the semis come out
Ill blow the engine out ya hemi no doubt
I'm New York cities pharaoh
Ill have you starin down the barrel
You got em good get em its cool hit em

[Hook]

[Prodigy]
You about to get that ass caught up in some shit
We about to show that ass how it get
When the jealousy turn envy n the shit
Turn deadly the innocent gets hit
Pull up in them whips
Tinted out spittin out
Hollows and they rip
Niggas apart in the dark
Or its day time its good with me
Just cool I brought the whole hood with me
We had a Gabriel right before MTV
So we can g him to give us that chain for cheap
We got David and Jacob for them bracelets and rings
Cause our verse in the hood makes their names ring
She take a picture with me on Bet
She the new talk of the hood it's PCP
One taste of the stick she hooked like fish
Me banks and have got this shit vice gripped
