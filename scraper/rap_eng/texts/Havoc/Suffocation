Yuh, crack open the safe
Oh boy, I've seen better days
Slam em wit a mace
Cover your bitch face in glaze
Bitch ain't gon' do a race
Man I'm always up to blaze
Got no grace
But we lit and fam u lame
Hella gang shit shit

We slayed the game, bruh
Stay in your lane, bruh
Smoke some cookie
Then I bang a bitch, bruh, aye

Cranky stanky hoe
We bout to bang em low-key
Got that purple fucking drank, swang
We gon' talk our damn slang, man

Believe us and you won't leave us
Chilly as fuck, dead inside, frozen heart
Po po lookin like Paul Blart

Smoke a joint in the park
Gonna rot in loneliness, in the dark
Damn, ho
