[Hook x2]
No matter where I go, you know I bring that heat
So if you wanna creep, remember bring that heat

[Verse 1: Havoc]
I never fell in love with a ho but I almost
Came close, found myself clapping natos
You know these broads now-a-days keep skeletons in their closet
Pussy-whipped ex-boyfriends
Strange reason I'mma meet the same chick
All the time, she a dime
Something wrong with her mind
At first conversation seemed normal
In no time she on you, but don't even know you
If you love a nice fatty it'll throw you, right off
Have her blow a nigga head right off
Nigga cough the wrong way, and I'm squeezing
Don't get mad at me, your girl freaking
Never talk much, let my hammer do the speaking
Y'all niggas conned to these broads, its a weakness
Pushing that seven with the deep dish
And you know I got that thing when I'm creeping

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
There ain't no such thing as chill, it's always on
No such thing as peace, it's always war
Every time a nigga try and have good thoughts
There's always something, and something always goes wrong
That's why I don't even tease myself no more
Or put smiles on my face, man that shit is all wrong
And all that is out the window from now on
My aim's to be seen on that page at the front
Whether it's murder or music, my niggas is anxious
You not gangsters, you niggas federal agents
They don't scare us doggy, we shoot at cops
You thought Pac was a problem, then you ain't seen a lot
Yo they took our comrades, what we gon' do
And yo Hav', you know they scheming on me and you
They can't handle this 2004 beat
They gotta send paper soldiers to shoot at me
But ambitious thugs, see visions of blood
In real life, cook my head, size is perfect done
Regardless of what color in the mother fucker's spectrum
We riding for you, dying for you, remember

[Hook]
