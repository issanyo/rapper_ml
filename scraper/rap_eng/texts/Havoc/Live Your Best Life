[Verse 1: Havoc]
The trials and tribulations, the charges a nigga facin'
I will never fold, my day is comin’, I could taste it
Rain, shine, keep it hidden on my waistline
This is from the horse mouth hangin' on the grapevine
I been done with the soft approach
I been shinin', I don’t need to put another coat
So hang yourself, I give these niggas just enough rope
I swear these niggas be doin' the most
And so I'm clowin' on you lil' dudes
I'm a winner 'cause I knew that I just couldn't lose
Hate to see me win, when they see me, yeah, they look confused
The first money that I ever made done lit a fuse
And then I blew like an M80
My closest friend to me, I seen them niggas actin’ shady
Like I give a fuck, like the Titans, you’ll remember us
Scared money never make money
Get your motherfuckin' spendin’ up

[Chorus: Cormega]
When you been through the worst, learn from it
Every lesson is a blessin' and a curse
Every day a step closer to the essence
Live your best life, put yourself first
When you been through the worst, learn from it
Every lesson is a blessin' and a curse
Every day a step closer to the essence (Yeah)
Live your best life, put yourself first

[Verse 2: Cormega]
My blood, sweat, and tears made it better for my fam
When I eat, I break bread and send letters to the can
Real recognize, you will never understand
Success 'til you fail and eventually prevail
The storm never weathered the respect of me and Hav
Endured to the present due to lessons from the past
A key to the future, my destiny was clear
I seen valleys and peaks, now I’m mentally prepared
Never weak-minded, Mega unique style is elite
I'm the cream of the crop, I keep risin'
Though the beast conspires against those bearing supreme likeness
Feared for sheer characteristics
Is it revered by savages, is it?
My back against the wall, a battery in it
I'm actually driven by passion, wisdom, and understandin'
My rap is authentic, that is the difference between fact and opinion
Indeed, as intended

[Chorus: Cormega]
When you been through the worst, learn from it
Every lesson is a blessin' and a curse
Every day a step closer to the essence
Live your best life, put yourself first
When you been through the worst, learn from it
Every lesson is a blessin' and a curse
Every day a step closer to the essence
Live your best life, put yourself first
