[Verse 1: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Piss in flats?
Damn, home sweet home
Another day waking to slugs in my room, no fret
Clouds above my head urinated while in bed
In Jesus Name
Collect rage to convert pain, My pounds the same
My angers in a twist, move wicked spirits
Try mess my sane, good was lame
Smiled while playing rockstar games, never my age
When parents whisp, shit, I could read lips
Ain't blind, Took 2 lips, 5 lines, About odd lives
Congo through the 12th door
Burgundy ain't easy
Had to spell my name just exactly like Toby
However it was R-I-C-H-whip, whip, whip
M-O-N-D, Receive sprain knees
Clocked my name eventually
Girls that like to me, used to like me
Olders with the body soakers
Dem sliths, deserve a pitch,Fork them pricks
I, Richy RICH, Hated that shit
Although, I clocked about pagans
Why call every one a pagan if your snaking to your nation
Streetwise real young, violence and girls had me sprung
On a reals I will always hate guns
Black for a reason, Had my veins squeezing
After treasons in my life, Had my demon freezing
A-R-0-N, primary school best friend
Throwing pencils under tables to the girls stables
Girls evolving, reception to 2nd education
Doo doo plats to weave, can you believe
Attitude from N17, past, a nigga left 12
Its a gift, in a present, 17

[Hook]

T'byss life there was a lap with a fucking drift
T'byss common place where ignorance was bliss
T'byss is a threat don't dare think its a gift

[Verse 2: RichyR.I.C.H.]

Nuh sell out, had to leave, shit had to leave
Hope every nigga I grew up with left the street dreams
Made of these, gucci belts with hearts on their sleeves
And when it bleeds tel them soldier boys
Rest In Peace, Fuck beef, The Evil Leash
Had the veterans beg please on their knees In Prison posting the Queen
Salute the realist, your living ruff? I can feel it
Its universal, not rehearsal
Survival, of the fittest
Clear their haze, YG slaves
Crave names in graves soon to pass some day
Pre order your destination
Attract to the enemies damnation
Believe in Christ before elevation
Took earthquakes to rock my cradle
Cleans my soul, clean all my lessons from wild fables
Money is not evil
Not avoidable, must be sale?
Unpredictable? Right
Prescribed Ganja, that's the medicine
Street Pharmacist supply them
Rumpelstiltskin leave the children
Not a flu all our sins had no bins
Lie, cheat n steal lead us to touch some skins
Friends mums said "don't ever hang with him"
Fuck "No ball games"
Profanity was praised like hymns
And hey, only had cuts from bey-blades
12 years, smoking ciggs and rolling with sticks
Shot stones, if not legit you had to blitz
Take the people out the hood
And not the hood from people
Remember this Rich, Where you came from n how u lived
Never forget you came from Tottenham's Abyss
