[Intro/Bridge]
I come to life
I come to life
Yeah, I come to life

[Verse 1]
I come to life when I'm drivin', see the city lights
Got me sippin', not too much, jus' startin' light
Because the night is young, and I got spots to hit
Bitches to see 'n' shit, shorty's body feverish
Perfected, light them bitches up to perfection
I'm destined, please don't try me, son
I'm bad, hood tested
All these nobody-names can't see my flow
You woulda' thought it was legal all this stour I blow
Wit' a mommy riding shotty, cute as Gwyneth Paltrow
Son, I'm all about this money, every day I count mo'
Fuck a Facebook, nigga' I'm all about bankin'
Fuck a Twitter follow, I'm paper chasin'
And never would you ever see a nigga slow down
Pretty faces everywhere, baby girl is goin' down
It's the fast life, I ain't even took my beatin'
And while you're out there, just stop cheatin'

[Hook]
I come to life in my fast, fast car
Your life can not ever be ours
My Testarossa same color as Mars
Buckle up, you are now riding with a star
[x2]

[Bridge]
I come to life
I come to life
Yeah, I come to life

[Verse 2]
Blood flowin', when I’m cruising give me a rush
Wanted me to go down, told 'er I just do it up
New York nigga, you can tell how my skin thick
Bustin' down some fried rice and rib tips
Feelin' bout my business, in for this, these niggas ridiculous
Y'all just wanna start shit, my nigga we finish it
So stop frontin' like y'all dudes can mess with me
I cut these fools like pizza pies with extra cheese
Make you a memory, have you laid out like the letter T
Never take my eyes off my enemy
Focused, when I’m in the room you feel my energy
Probably movin' wrong if these haters ain’t upset with me
So I keep em fumin', you can see the girl in 'em
I tell em keep it moving 'fore we put them hollows in 'em
And ain’t nobody see it, we do it on the low
Then jump in the whip, son it’s time to go

[Hook]
I come to life in my fast fast car
Your life can not ever be ours
My Testarossa same color as Mars
Buckle up, you are now riding with a star
[x2]

[Bridge]

I come to life
