We got the Catholics, Muslims & Christians prayin who the fuck would make us
Molly gave me devil ash, I made her take angel dust
She was heaven sent to kill off these slags, I was hell bent on rapin' these sluts

I’m the pain in your ass, she’s the ache in your nuts
If you looked ahead, you would’ve notice were dangerous
Bonnie & Clyde, how the fuck could they mistake us
More like Ian & Mira, I told you cunts to upgrade us
Stray jacket in a padded room couldn’t strain us
Got the kids hangin' in the womb, go ahead blame us
This is the outcome of Anji mixin' ecstasy with shrooms, were almost fuckin' famous
Look at the sheets on the death bed there stainless
I write to Nirvana beats my heads brainless
