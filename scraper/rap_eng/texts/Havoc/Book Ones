(Sam Boice verse)

...

Ball with the ball ally oop bang bang
I been scoring with the rock since they pop slang cane
Still the same game this the drop box project
Low floor on the high rise my mind get
Tired of the jabber jaws got to progress
Stressed blaze sess let it rest yes yes yall
Moving forward like this sentence or
Game of the board take a chance make it raw
Till them ears get sore
Bleed
This was always for the people who adore the words
Let em read can't you see its teach over preach
Mix it with a little peace
At the end of the day we all get what we need believe
I'm a lion with the mane
Seeing zebras in the land
Get the fuck up out the way
What's a predator to prey when I'm hungry nothing
Eat ya like consumption
Coming from the dungeon I been summoned by the
Ouija board
Smoking green like Luigi sports
Eating Wheaties what I need these for
I'm eating horns that the devil stores
Form storms when the records on
Class bringing order court in now adjourn
What you here for you need more I'm spiritual
I take the spirit that you form
When the soul in ya eyes gone
My eyes low
High from the weed smoke
I go by floating like a fucking boat
I'm so high look down on the ozone
Who am I Class working pro bono
Drop Box you ain't fucking with it go ahead and die slow
