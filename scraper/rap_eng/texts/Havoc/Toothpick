[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
Yo I got this
Crass classless style without practice
Employing rap tactics sharper than desert cactuses
I’m hard to stabilize, I grab a mask and dash and staple eyes
Improvise a false demise without surprise
My mind is fortified from ’95 to eternity
My flows will send you back inside your mama like maternity
Absurdity, my tracks will leave you speechless, Helen Keller
Darker than your vision, Nocturnal, like Heltah Skeltah
I might be atheist but I still believe in the BasedGod
Even when I was 10, I had no trouble to debate God
I stay odd, poking at some roadkill with a clothes hanger
Feeding cans of mayonnaise to Amanda just to see her angered
Stole a van and vanished to Dracula’s abandoned mansion
Met up with Charles Manson and stashed bodies for slashing
Who’s the fool that picked the lunatic that showed without a Buddha stick
And ain’t that into rudiments and raps like Martha Stewart’s shit
Record this, as I strangle him with a phone that’s cordless
Remorseless, of course I tore this track in every orifice

[Verse 2: Big Boogie]
Submit sick synthesis, wishing I split witnesses
Pissing on shit lyricists with triple six sentences
Menaces like how Denace is
And it's a race to the finishes, I diminish kids
Dirty like a person that rapes ratchets
And I don't make magic, but I still escape from my straitjacket
Take drastic rips from the blunt, hits so massive
I finished it in one hit, and never passed it
I'm large like jurassic
Most rappers at my school have lyrics softer than a pair of asses
I'm staying humble, blowing up like a dick bubble
Quicker than some fat bitch eating McDoubles
Causing trouble, leave them all beheaded
No need for paramedics, I got the anesthetics
You know my steez like Capital, I'm the captain
That's draining the capillaries from the kneecaps of handicaps
