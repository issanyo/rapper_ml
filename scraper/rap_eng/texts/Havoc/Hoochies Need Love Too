[Hook]
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoochie
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, groove with me
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoochie
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, groove with me

So you're trippin', cuz I'm a little rougher than you're used to
I ain't the one you act a fool to
Step to me roam, and I'mma snap your neck
And put your ho in check, and if ya take another step... *gun cocks*
Back in the day, if I will remember
You had the hanky for a hoochie now you're frontin' when you're near me
And you know a hoochie ain't a hizoe
That's why you gotta gizo
But really you don't here me though
But anyway, I ain't trippin'
So don't you slip, cuz I'm dippin'
This sucka you ain't pimpin', uh
You gotta step to a hoochie with a little more game on your tongue
Oh yes, I get hung
And I don't need a father figure
Daddy dearest tryna nut up
Put your game up or shut the fuck up
And about that little tramp you supportin'
You're starin' me down, but I'm that hoochie you was shortin'

[Hook]

Everybody's out to dis a hoochie, but don't even front
Just slide up a blunt
You gots to groove me to step to me
Ooh-ee ooh-ee, do he want me?
Or is he just a freaky brother fiendin' for some booty?
And thinkin' a bad ass hoochie might give the skins quicker
You got another thing comin' little nigga
We grew up on the same block, we went through the same
Now how you gonna have me deal with you?
You'se a trick
We both saw your momma get beat down by your pops
And saw your auntie get freaked down by your pops
And watched your ass get toe down
Just like your pops, and you gets no props
Now you're tryna educate your mind
Five percent and Klein, and you never touch the swine
But what about that old fade that you're sportin'?
You're starin' me down, but I'm that hoochie you was shortin'

[Hook]

So step to the left of mine
Cock it out when I'm ringin' your chimes
A chocolate brotha on my arm, and he's fine
Yeah, and I'm...
Groovin' cuz I know he's right here
And can't nobody jump in my groove, I pumps fear
And y'all be lookin' at my man, however I'm peepin' you
A hoochie or not, my size 8 will be deep in you
Forget the peace treaty when you're steppin' to a sweetie
Sucka, you can't understand
I got his back-up if he needs me
Just like that Bonnie and Clyde, or that busta and that hoochie
Yeah, I gotta have me a brotha strong enough to groove me

Groove with me
So come on and groove me
Even though I'm a hoo-hoo-hoochie

[Hook until the song ends]
