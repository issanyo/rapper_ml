[Havoc]
It's all, ready in motion, you cowards getting laid down
Soundscan looking weak, at a high escape now
Play around, lay around, niggas getting left out
Dudes trying to steal the kid swag like a klepto
Won't be satisfied until I let the tech blow
Ride through your hood, with no problemo
Creeping on you niggas, don't get caught sueno
Yeah, you know it's nothing for me to clap the metal
Mobb etched in stone, we heavy in the ghetto
I've been trying to tell 'em, way before the label shelved them
Get your weight up first, and then talk to me
You not caked up, your whole team booty
Ya'll done say shit, I react with the toolie
I know your history, you can't fool me
Table for them groupie niggas can't fool me

[Hook: Nyce]
I'mma keep on banging, til they set me free
I'mma ride til I die, head to the sky, til he set me free
Still riding on til the Lord give me greens
I'mma ride, homey, til the Lord give me greens
I'mma ride, homey, til the Lord give me greens
I'mma ride, homey, til the Lord give me greens
Two guns up, label me a fucking king

[Prodigy]
Amen, ain't nothing popping off over there, but your mouth
P the newest shit cracking like them niggas down south
H keep making these beats for me to kill
Our studios like a morgue, cuz songs get bodied
I shoot up your bass, stab up your drums
P keep writing that shit that you could feel
And reach out and touch, cuz this shit real
I pity the fool that ain't hit the Mobb Deep
You niggas is food, we vultures, we gon' eat
We show you how to move in a room full of lions
Infamous, can't nobody stop our glory
Whoever said they could, they was telling stories
This is not a fable, these our the facts
Prodigy and Havoc leave you bleeding on your back
When Prodigy and Havoc come to catch a little wreck
I break ya little neck and take ya little shine
You dumber then a mule, you fucking with some dons
Hav is a don from way beyond
P is a don P, like the Don Perigion
Catch a nigga slipping, pop bottles when they gone

[Hook]

[Nyce]
I see me in a casket, niggas touching my corpse
Going down in history, as the king of New York
And BK the Unit, we the new Supreme Team
Dream team machines with a beam blow ya spleen
Out ya Maskeen jeans, you green fiend
Uh, nothing but cash, is what I'm hearing
Getting money now, so I dump the cannon out the Phantom
Fuck the fan, I keep the strap both sides of my hip
When I'm squeezing, the only time I ghost ride the whip
Dump dump reload, the wrong fire strength
Uh, eyes bloodshot, ride let the sub plot
Die from a blood clot, try to make this thug stop
My enemies scared and they panicking
Remember me? Leave this nigga stiff like a mannequin, homey
It's over, nigga back on the stretcher
AK's and max with the all black oppressor
When a nigga die, bury me with a beretta
So when I get to hell, man, I got a vendetta
And that's how it's going down, it's thug life forever

[Hook]
