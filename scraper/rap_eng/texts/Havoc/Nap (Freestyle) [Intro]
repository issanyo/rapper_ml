[Verse 1]
Ayo, It's lit!
My life's a roller coaster
Full of troubles and lies and getting older
My Gramps was always sober
He married my Nana but I don't know why he chose her Uh
Cuz they broke up when my dad was only three
Leaving the big guy walking down the street
[Verse 2]
I just wanna take a nap
Cuz when the world leaders attack
They're gonna blow us off the map
And it's gonna happen to us so fast
My sadness and anger is gonna is gonna clash
And it's going to be incredibly bad
[Verse 3]
All i see is people selling weed on the streets and at school
These people are fools
We gotta make some peace
How bout we catch some sleep huh?
[Verse 4]
My arms are long like an Ostrich Leg
I'm gonna be dead one day
I know it
Actually, I don't know...
I might be the chosen one
