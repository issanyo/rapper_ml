[Verse 1: Havoc]
Goddamn my son just got hit
Time to bounce out of [north click?]
And come home to the same old bull shit
Call the emergency room then I assume
Prepare for the worst, look [?]
I know [?] the young black male
I waited, she said "no doubt, he won't make it"
I paused, try to face it
A tear jerked [?]
95 North, 200 miles from New York
First reaction, [called?] up son, what happened?
I was in my bed, when I heard niggas clappin'
[looked?] out the window, saw a black coupe merk off
It was the Lex, at the time I wasn't sure
Police lights, yellow tape, ambulances
Homicide Ds state
My [?] took no chances
'Till I saw his moms
With mad blood in her arms
Tried to stay calm, looked down, it was the [?]
Shook my head
My motherfuckin' main man's dead
That was my heart, my motherfuckin' man 'till the end
Yo, I said [?]
You know the deal just chill
When you get my page, meet me on the hill
[1 L?]
Called up P, "some bad news
They just bodied [?], inform the whole crew"
Finally in New York, [?] met up with P
Hit the lab, gave niggas third degree
[Hit the knowledge?]
Suspicious niggas up in [?]
[?], I think he used to cop that Chronic
By the way I think [?]
Ever since, shit was tense, and mad shady
He [?] find out, [said son up?] for the kill
Hit him with a offer too good to [be to deal?]
It made sense, [?] was on point, probably bent
Made a connect, hung up the phone, left the tec
Strike back
That was my man so fuck that
In the Tahoe
Black mask,on the low
Doin' 95, sunrise they gotta go
Let the heat blow
No words, just let 'em know
Came to a corner [pull?] up son, there go a Lex
The shit is black, on top of that I think that's it
One in the back, two in the front
Fuck it
Take aim, grab the gat, then buck it
I don't know kid

[Hook: [?]]
Every night, every day
All I hear is mad gun play
I think I'm losing my mind
Every night, every day
All I hear is mad gun play
I think I'm losing my mind

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
It was a quarter to two, Saturday afternoon
Me and my blood Stobo on the avenue
Jamaica Avenue, plannin' to stick a few
Niggas cop a [jewel?], say what we gonna do
Slide up in the coliseum on some [humbly?]
We got connects, our family works security
[And?] put us on the undercover jakes [did?]
A lady copper, [red?], a Spanish kid with blonde hair
And oh yeah
A white kid buyin' diamonds
He one-timin', throwin' niggs off cause he's shining
Everyone else is a vic, take your pick
[Scare?] a few niggas [?]
Son, I got him
He just bought a 4G necklace
He had it on layaway
[?]
Catch him in the parking lot, do jux on the rooftop
Oh hold up
He just made a pit stop
The food court
We pause for a second, kick it with my man a few
The kid don't catch on to what we plan to do
He finished eating as he rose up the escalator
Told my man "peace and love, yeah yeah, much later"
We got some shit to attend to
Let's not forget what we came to do
By the way I want his ring
Two minutes later, on the first level
He stopped to talk to some chick
Fuck that, it's time to meet the Devil
We followed him to [?] they took a cute picture
Now picture this, Stobo walked in and slapped the nigga
"Yo, that's my bitch, nigga, fuck yo"
We grabbed him up, threw him in the back room
Where they be [doing?] all that shit
[Took out?] his pockets, grabbed his ring and his chain too
Handcuffed his wrist to his ankle
Then jetted to the dance school
And layed [low?] for a few

[Hook: [?], fading out]
Every night, every day
All I hear is mad gun play
I think I'm losing my mind
