We don’t got no choice
We choice to get busy

Hook x2
Get busy, get get get busy yall
Get busy, get get get busy yall
Get busy yall, get get busy yall
Get busy yall, get get busy yall

Verse 1
NYC to my casket
Got a nigga workin in that since, did you back it?
See why niggas hatin cuz they money like molasses
See that’s how it is when you hustle it backwards
They handlin that ratchet, have you dippin in and out of traffic
Hand out the window, throwin out my blunt ashes
Money on my mind so it appears like magic
Fuck around illusion, motherfuckers all vanish
I only fuck with family
From day one when one nigga had that cavalry
Back when Knicks had that nigga Marcus Camby
Had to make it work, a nigga never had a plan B
Go get a status, salute in yo Gucci fabric
Everything fly, gotta have it
Might sound shallow, got a fetish for a bad bitch
A true believer, ain’t nothing that I can’t get
Get it!

(Hook)

Verse 2
I beg your pardon, 1st degree birds
The flow is arson and my car’s a starship
Here’s sneak peak, show you what I’m involved in
Death to anybody, get it’s the order with coffins
It’s a hood thing, going in the belly of the beast
A C-section couldn’t pull me out of this geef
All my niggas is warriors, get hit with a spear tip
Poison on the end of that bitch, that’s the end of that bitch
Niggas clinching, I ain’t friend of that shit
I leave a nigga leakin like a coke nose drip
In them cowards did you with, yea I seen em all dip
I’m like salsa, no tortilla, shut yo mouth up
Niggas on the outskirts, make you feel threats
For years getting bread, it ain’t go stale yet
Niggas said your name, it ain’t ring a bell yet
I’m talkin lot of shit now, money on my breath motherfuckers

(Hook)


Verse 3
Memoires of a nigga, I’ve been there
The world minds and everything in this bitch
Yall talkin it but, yall not livin it
New different shit, every day whippin it

We ain’t getting it
Get busy get get get busy yall
We ain’t getting it
Get busy get get get busy yall
We ain’t getting it
Get busy yall, get get busy yall
We ain’t getting it
Get busy yall, get get busy yall

Hook
Get busy get get get busy yall
Get busy get get get busy yall
Get busy yall, get get busy yall
Get busy yall, get get busy yall
