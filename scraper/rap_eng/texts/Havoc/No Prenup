[Hook: Havoc]
So watch the clock tick, we got em lookin sick
We fill our bank account like bullet fill our clips
So nigga kill yourself, where you livin' ain't livin'
When it come to makin' paper all we got is tunnel vision
Y'all niggas out here blind, couldn't even cop a Prius
I'm half-way around the world with my fuckin' feet up
Ya cowards hatin', gotta struggle tryna re-up
You be married to this life, bitch, no prenup

[Verse: Precious Paris]
A toast to all my thots, never mindin' the cops
When I get approached, I say I'm guardin' my spot
A lot of thots think they hot, but they really not
Pimp body pimp do, put em back in the spots
Linked up with boo boo, double my wages
It the godfather, so don't ask me for favors
Keep my paper on the leash, dawgs in the street
War spit, real shit, employees gotta eat
Gettin' money, watch this hustler, all you could do is wonder
My circle's on a different, level, you can't even touch her
No checkers, just chess, I don't trade, I invest
And I work hard, so when I play, bitch, I spend the rest
How the next check? How the bay, ho?
Fool around the world with 50 k of yayo
First stop, Paris, my ma, gettin' richer and richer as the minutes go by

[Hook: Havoc]
So watch the clock tick, we got em lookin sick
We fill our bank account like bullet fill our clips
So nigga kill yourself, where you livin' ain't livin'
When it come to makin' paper all we got is tunnel vision
Y'all niggas out here blind, couldn't even cop a Prius
I'm half-way around the world with my fuckin' feet up
Ya cowards hatin', gotta struggle tryna re-up
You be married to this life, bitch, no prenup

[Verse: Precious Paris]
I'm glad you so mad, I'm so bad
Rubbin' nubbles with the rough, can't even do that
Me? I'm a boss bitch, find me on my horses
Thing affiliated, throw it at em like I'm nauseous
I'm on my own wave, own way, distant
Like you on yo laptop readin' my mentions
Makes no difference when you're in it
That's why only fuck with niggas that fuck with me from the beginning
I deserve it! I deserve it and earned it, walked on bridges and burned it
Built the shits back up by myself, misheard mint
For my nigga ? cause I got
Gettin' bread around the world, bitch I got it on me now
Blue team to calm me down, sexin' em to call it up
Makin' money in my sleep, that's what I call makin' luv
Fuck you niggas really run, I ain't got nothin' fo you
Plus, you ain't got shit for me
Don't involve my destiny

[Hook: Havoc]
So watch the clock tick, we got em lookin' sick
We fill our bank account like bullet fill our clips
So nigga kill yourself, where you livin' ain't livin'
When it come to makin' paper all we got is tunnel vision
Y'all niggas out here blind, couldn't even cop a Prius
I'm half-way around the world with my fuckin' feet up
Ya cowards hatin', gotta struggle tryna re-up
You be married to this life, bitch, no prenup
