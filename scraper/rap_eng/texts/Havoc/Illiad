(Verse)
I got no watch
It’s the same socks
And when the name Prock’s
I want you to aim shots
I don’t give a fuck and i dont know if that makes me harder
See I’m not one to bother
Cuz to me there’s nothing better to do
Then stunt the growth of these little rappers and sever a few
Fuck these little bitches and get charged like 6ix9ine
You could watch ur mouths but can’t fix minds
Talking shit in the hot spot
Got pac shot, and biggie killed
Left a void that still to fill
I’m fuckin restless
Always chasing the best shit
3 minutes and you’re on to the next bitch
Money loves my company I make the check flip
And it’s been here from the start of it
But there’s a difference being a part of it and the heart of it
I gotta lot to get
From the stacks to the plaques
And everything in between
A rapper in a room full of actors
I’m in the scene
There’s so much that line should tell you
Fire’s in the eyes I call it the hell’s view
Won’t quit till gold turns from what I grab
Won’t stop till I earn everything I have
You can’t respect without getting ur feet wet
In deep threat
And that goes out to each vet
Cuz the battle royal
Has never been deadlier
The fuckin game
Has never been wealthier
The stock of Pandora’s box
Has never been higher
So being the best has never been this dire
Far in the deep in it’s like I dove in
Effortlessly like I rode in
On Lucifer’s back
Satan uses me to rap
Harbor the hate and use it for that
Even to her death Whitney was using some crack
My damnation’s my saving grace
Whitney was never the same after she had a taste
I drew it up now draw the conclusion
See it’s all an illusion
For all to see
Shit’s my Iliad next is the oddessy
Through the teething
I’m drawing up the sieging
With my legion
Fuck a bad taste
I’m leaving lesions
And if you’re breathing then the job’s not finished
I got in this, cuz I was made for this
The reason I hate this shit
Is cuz where I’m standing
Every faggot has their hand in
Claiming they’re gamin
But only aimin, for fame and, some followers
Dick riders and swallowers
But enough with the bullshit
And understand shots start
With a full clip
