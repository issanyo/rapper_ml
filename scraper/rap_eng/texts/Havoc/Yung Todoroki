Todoroki with the flame aye
I don't really need a nickname aye
I don't really care about the fame aye
I don't really even need to aim aye

You can feel the ground rumble when my ice gets to creeping
Try to mess with me I will leave your body in the deep end
Can you feel the heat? I see my fire on your skin it's feeding
Cut the air thin, you're so scared, i can hear you breathing

Powers so next level call the ref cause you think I'm cheating
Try so hard to beat me I can feel your organs bleeding
Getting too intense I think that my body's overheating
I don't even need to try in the end I'm always leading
