[Intro: (Sounds), Kane]
(Sounds of grate opening)
Damn I made it
I gotta find my boy T, he'll know what to do

[Verse 1]
Out on the Streets, ducking both cops and gunshots
Escaped felon, when they come around that's when the fun stops
Making this money, looking at all this Versace shit
Gangsters with golden grills, driving those Maserati Whips
They think cause they got big guns, that that's what they'll rob me with?
They couldn't rob me with anything, guess that's an accomplishment
Ain't no stoppin us, cops looking through infrared binoculars
Picking off targets, looking for segments to start popping us
Had to ditch the clothes and steal some homeless garments
Try to remain silent and identify where my homie's car is
Had to ditch the guns, smash them against the brick wall
Throw em' into sewer tunnels, hearing the sirens kick off
Make a dash for the crooked halls, trying not to look suspicious
Looking over my shoulders trying to spot the snitches
Hide in the dark, cops run by, pain from the gout in my feet
Damn that was a close one, I gotta get out of the streets

[Hook]
Out on the Streets, making moves, dodging gunshots
"Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya"
Don't wait around or you'll know the sound the snub pops
"Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya"

[Verse 2: Tommy, Kane]
I found my boy Tommy, and he read my case file
Shit dude, you better stay in my place a while
Let's get you some presidents, take this piece from my hand
I'll have you swimming in bundles of green with rubber bands
Shit alright, what's the job
A friend needs to go and make some drops
The cops breathing on him though, they got no respect
You help make some sales and he'll give you a check
Good shit, I pick up packages, hit up the chosen spots
Third one on the list, a dark, empty car lot
Put one down near a door and I start sprintin'
Cause a rival dealer's chasing me, that's when I sling the clip in
Turn around (Boom Boom), right inside the eye socket
The spot's hot, I want my check, find the package, I cop it
Bring it back to my spot, open up the package
Shit, pure cut cocaine, time to get it crackin'

[Hook]
Out on the Streets, making moves, dodging gunshots
"Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya"
Don't wait around or you'll know the sound the snub pops
"Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya"

[Verse 3]
Shit, well I just got some bread
My boy Tommy on the lookout for the cops instead
He told me "You go and pop some heads
I'll lay back and tell you when I find info, then we'll drop some lead"
Well alright, you know that you the man though
Licensed to carry handgun, all black camo
Now my job? Let's go off and make some money
Gotta make some drops then hop out like the bunnies
It's funny, how the fuck could I have thought I'd survive
I'm tired of doing drops just so I can get by
I'm anxious, I want Tommy to tell me what's down
Pop by his apartment door, hear him making love now
For fucks sake, you had a job to do but he's my bro
So I guess I'll wait outside patiently while he's fuckin' his ho
Knock twice, "Tommy hurry up and finish
You have all the time in the world to get up and get in it"
Ok chill dude, I'll be out in a peep
But first, let me bust on her teets

[Outro: (Sounds), Tommy, HOOKER, Kane]
(Door opens)
Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out
I WON'T
Right, so I got your info
Awesome, what's up
Let me give you the quick shit
