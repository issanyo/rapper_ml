(Verse )
Your heart beat thumping
Your blood is pumping
When beef get to jumping
My hammers dumping
My aim is precise so I'm hitting something
You shooting to scare, so you shooting for nothing
You put up  a facade, but i know you a fraud
Cause real gangstas don't pillow talk to broads
Real gangstas don't broadcast we don't want applauds
A lot of niggas got left tryna get right with God
You tryna get even, I leave you odd
Tie a rope around your neck till you blue like a avatar
Dump in the reservoir
No ski mask
You killed by Pablo EscoBARS
You could tell bitches lies
But when I look in your eyes
I see who you are
You a bitch to your core
Like a tranny
Ima hard knock like Annie
Bullet holes in bags in chips
I shoot your granny
Money hoes and fancy fits
So uncanny
You a snitch just like Sammy
The bull
Gats I pull
Clips full
When you gon realize
Ain't no such thing as fake tough guys
You just like J. Reid
Undercover D in disguise
And if you ratting
Rat traps and cheese filled with pesticide

(Verse 2)

Never had a role model
Never had no one to follow
Give and go get the choppa I let it go
Shooting like affalo
The hood is worse then the Apollo
Instead getting booed
You catching a hollow
Or two
Krazy what money a make nigga do
It'll make him pick up that tool
Like he trying to fix something
Only thing he tryna fix is his pockets
Cause he broke
Looking for a come up
He'll scrabble your egg
And turn it to a omelett forthe  profi
I'm hotter than a comet
You faker than a comic
Book
You flash jewels
They get took
If them shits fake
Then I know where to look
I been having nightmares
That I would never make it off the block
Be a grown man selling dimes
Lost track of time
Like I never seen a clock
They killed Reno and blick
That's why I keep a Glock
Because niggas be hating
Patently waiting
To catch you slipping
Like ice skating
Nina always with me like we dating
You wanna beef I wanna eat
And times a wasting
Nowdays you gotta watch the niggas you smoke wit
Cause money turn homies to enemies real quick
Now he load clips , man he won't quit 
And now he plotting on how he gon fuck yo bitch
Be careful when hating shit leaves your mans lips
He'll probably say it's a joke but that's bull shit
He got a bullet with your name on it
And can't wait to pull It
Waiting to do you how Rico did Mitch
