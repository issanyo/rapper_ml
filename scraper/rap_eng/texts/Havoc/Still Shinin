[Intro: Rock]
Bring in that next beat, though.  Word up.  Come on, man, stop playing.  You’re bothering me right now.  I’m trying to let niggas know, man, let ‘em know why we wild.  All my Generation X motherfuckers.  Don’t even understand this, you can’t figure it out but don’t sweat it though.  Nigga, y’all wild ‘cause y’all supposed to be wild.  Gangbanging and shit.  [?].  They know.  Someone has to say the word, nigga.  [?] (DJ Unknown and DJ Mek).  Yo

[Verse 1: Rock]
Enemies, stay off of
My block.  [?] big Rock.  Do not rock or I’ll
Drop ya.  In Cali terms, I’ll break you off something proper
I ain’t exactly the nigga you want to front on
Nigga, please.  Picture you and me in a one-on
Come on.  Shit’ll get ugly—you don’t even wanna look
So don’t be thinking of buying strap, that you off-the-hook
Ruck is the way that I’ll be walking.  Many get stalking
Many get floating in slow-motion like Steve Austin
Crossing my path.  Entitled’s that ass in khaki
For my new gat.  When burners are new, I don’t know how to act
Fuck it.  Just another notch up on the belt, the
Heltah Skeltah.  The heat might swelter or melt ya
Be what I be.  So is he, the inflictster
Just ‘cause we argue all the time, don’t get the wrong picture
We’re tighter than pussy, punk.  You don’t want static
We start mad Ruckus and Rock domes while we’re at it
Got a bad habit: smoking faggots, and
All y’all niggas.  Shit, I’ll pop you pussies like you’re plastic
Punks fucking with Rock?  It takes your whole mob to tangle
‘Cause one right to your jaw’ll break your fucking angles
I got the fever for the flavor of a body and I
Got me a shottie, some Bacardi—motherfuck a hottie
I’m loyal to my MAC-10 and my friends, punk
What?  G’s in the front, hoes in the trunk
You know it’s going down.  I’m telling ya
Word is bond.  Prepare for Heltah Skeltah
Biatch

[Outro: Rock]
Word to my pops and I stand strong for my moms.  What’s going on?  Word up.  DJ Unknown in the jump-off.   Hahahahaha.  And DJ Mek.  And DJ Foreman, where you at?  Ay
