[Verse 1:]
Yo, I'm reppin' A D E L, City of Churches
But i don't repent for any of these verses
In the South, we'll kill you leave your body in hurses
Runnup on your spouse in her house, and snatch her purse kid
Is this a ghetto lullaby, or surfer's paradise?
I live in Seaford, but only ever seem to see Forward
Focuses, full of all us young bored bogans
And daughters that done 'D' like one Paul Hogan
ADHD, A.K.A, we're broken
No hopers, another excuse to do more coke, then
Weekends wasted, drug addicted evolution
T-rex, are we the Children of the Revolution
But this illusion only happens in our heads
A mixture of hallucinogen's and unprotected sex
Should probably be in our beds, but instead we're out here smokin'
If ask about Sea-town, i'd say i'm "Only Coping"
But if you said anything, i'd fucking rip you open
No joking, hometown pride is what i'm toting for the '69
Coz you know the heart on my sleeve
Don't fuck with that, coz that shit ain't a token

[Chorus]
Any day, could be your last in the jungle
I live in Seaford, but only ever seem to see forward
I'm proud of my city full of Meth Labs
Crackhead slackers living off skateboards, weed, durries and Maccas (2x)

[Verse 2]
I rep my city. No point in de-nyin’
Don’t sound nice, but fuck any anit down wit tha ’69
I’m benign, when I’m round in my city
Spittin vivid images in ya vision so when ya sittin’
Only then in that instant, y’all begin to start to get the picture
And the penny drops, when it hits ya
And I’ll pick it up, coz these days I’m the oppistie of what’s ‘getting richer’
And if you beat me to the punch, I might hit ya
My neighbour’s Richard, we’re good mates
Most would go rigid if they heard the fuckin sound that this hood makes
But it puts me in a good state
A bridge over troubled water, disorder’s clearly the mindstate
But it’s my place, in my state, I wouldn’t trade
Wouldn’t be mobile without the fuckin train
But to survive, ya gotta be fuckin trained
Sea-Town, to me, i gotta say, ya fuckin great
Leave other hoods around us eating sour grapes
If we can’t leave we’ll always find a reason to stay, motherfucker

[Chorus x 2]

[Verse 3]
All these adversities, come like anniversaries
Life is a curse, you end up in the hurse eventually
Till then, i guess yo'll see my murder spree rhyming scheme
Deep sea diversity, deep in her 'c' with my 'd'
I'm talking alphabet, fuck the other pets
I'm the Alpha, bet, i'm number one
Gimmie a metal, coz i feel like i've won
Don't meddle with the devil or it'll make you back peddle, punk
Sounds tough
But a product of my surroundings
You get downed if ya tripping offa that motherfuckin' clown shit
If lifes a  circus,  my home suberb the  freakshow
Perfect a place
For tyke to be inspired and then see growth
I'm all for peace,  But don't need no one for protection
Coz many times I've seen the other end of the spectrum
Its probably best if they don't trya and  make me go that direction
Coz 69 till I die, Seaford life AM reppin'

[Chorus x 5]
