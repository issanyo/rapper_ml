[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh
Yeah...

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Baby mama let's roll, here we go, Cheerio, Serial
Killa with the flow and the blow and the dro'
And the gun go ring, hit 'em all in a row
AK-47, .40-Glock, .44, let 'em know from the door
How it go, it's not a joke, there's gon' be a homicide
I'mma ride, I'mma rep me a nigga up in the box
And send 'em to his folks, his bloods, his kin
The drama it don't end, bust a gun
Bust a nigga's face open with the hand
Tell 'em go tell a friend, tell a cop, tell the FEDS
I don't give a mothafuck, you niggas and the pigs
I'mma let the world see you, you're a bitch, you're a snitch
I'mma Mobb Deep gangsta, Infamous soldier
If you got a cold heart then my shit just froze over
Range Rover, Chevy Suburban, the bullet proof trim
The windows on the crib, bullet proof them

[Chorus x2: Prodigy]
You're fucking with a Dirty New Yorker
Queens in this bitch fall back or get roped up
You're fucking with a Dirty New Yorker
Queens mothafucka, move and get smoked up

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Ay' let's go
Yeah, yeah I'm for the drama but I'm so laid back
A nigga get at me I'm gon' get 'em right back
I will say that, my flows so crack
You could put 'em in redtops and bump that back
On the block or the corner, you slip you a goner
Your nose's getting warmer, the Ds out for ya
Get money-money or take money-money
Always on my fly shit never catch the kid bummy
Shorty on my nuts like sweats
And it taste like metal said that's where I keep the Tec
What do you expect, ho niggas from let go
Me and him was cool, just a mothafucking sec ago
Shit, Hav' a professional, nigga kill the noise
You ain't mothafucking techno
Boy I get several, things that severe you
Can't see hell, come here here's a better view

[Chorus x2: Prodigy]
