(Prodigy)
Yeah, when darkness consumes the neighbourhood streets
The neighbourhood hoods and the neighbourhood creeps
Come out to play with they hats pulled down and their hoodies pulled over below they eyebrows, take yo ass in the crib you not down for madness, bout to go down three at night
Night shift workers come home they walk fast, scared to go through they own block yeah its that bad, the villains making a killing selling pieces of weight, Nj inside a hot chamomile tea keep em warm because the cold air will cut your skin
It's bleeding outside but the block still clicking, there's cameras in the hood but the fiends still smoke, the narcs making movies they looking for the role of the worlds dumbest criminal caught on film while the real criminal minds continue to thrive in

(Chorus)

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps getting shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crack heads and dope fiends dare travel
Where police enter at they own risk
If you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks
Most bodies get caught at night
You'll be choking on blood staring up at the stars in the twilight

(Prodigy)

It's 2012 and drugs still moving, the balance don't stop and the prisons is full with, scarface thugs Cs and Bs, who do years and come back to the same routine, some say the game over they must be blind, bet they don't come through the real hoods at night, with that theoretical shit, you shit your draws, you'll get robbed for your outfit yeah take that off, disparity rules the world the rich is outnumbered, you can't straddle the fence pick a side fucker, you got till the sun go down, cos when that full moon rise then the wolves come out, and the cocaine vampires slinging hard white, from dusk to dawn its nothing like, the movies we drink holy water rock crucifixes and eat garlic and onion chips for dinner

(Chorus)

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps getting shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crack heads and dope fiends dare travel
Where police enter at they own risk
If you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks
Most bodies get caught at night
You'll be choking on blood staring up at the stars in the twilight

(Havoc)

Yeah and this is right up my alley P, likewise won't let a nigga strattle me, pull up the cavalry, the salary is running low, now I'm at a stoke tell me what I wanna know, I need addresses how to access it, you know it's something if you got that nigga Hav stressing, your mans know I got him stocking up on mad vests, I been down this road so this my last ditch eft it, no homo everybody get naked, play hero I spin you like a hit record, my goons bipolar eyes over shoulder, and how ironic more gruesome when I'm sober, nocturnal won't rest till learn, you taste pussy got a bitch in your guy circle
I shoot shots at your cop Colonel, talking all that fly shit thats what it'll earn you

(Chorus)

The hood in the twilight you hear guns bark
Street lamps getting shot out to keep the block dark
We post up in the blackness of the shadows
Where only crack heads and dope fiends dare travel
Where police enter at they own risk
If you not from this hood get yo ass out the bricks
Most bodies get caught at night
You'll be choking on blood staring up at the stars in the twilight
