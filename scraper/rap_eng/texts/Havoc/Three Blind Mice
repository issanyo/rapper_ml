Yeh, everyday man
Yeh, no guilt

[Verse 1]
I ain’t felt no guilt in a while
All them guys in the guild they beguiled
Eye for an eye they ain’t a patch on my style
This rap thing’s shit, I’m just the top of the pile
Who then are you men?
I’m coming with the piece, not true zen
Pop and decease and desist, any who peepin at this
When I flip it, man, spin move, don’t matter if they creepin they miss
All of them in the circle just huddle, my vision see further than hubble
These balloon raps pop off, sorry to burst your bubble
Little rappers get burnt with their wack talks
Ain’t got no spark, I put you in the match-box
Or beat you like a  boxing match, trick
Don’t try and jux the style you can’t even steal socks that match, and shit
Flecks of spit fly as the rhymes brush over your head
Without a single drop of bleach, I give your whole crew frosted tips
The bars throw shade like sun-up in a jailhouse
Why am I there when I’m young enough to be jailbait
Sparks don’t fly, no Tinder match, rhymers out of date
Stock standard rappers got a stale mouth

[Hook]
Three blind mice; see how they run
Every which way to the witch’s house the smell entice
Uh, one by one she cook thrice
Anyone can lose their vision for the right price
You ever wonder, what Mother Hubbard’s canine picked
If she ain’t have a bone in her cupboard?
You think she had that Pedigree covered?
Nah, that dog became a hunter, muzzle got blood coloured

[Verse 2]
I’m sure when I’m old and withered these will be my best years
Seers to the coffin, I differ from these drifters
Can’t push ‘em off the cliff; already hit rock bottom
I dither from their path, organic raps when I off ‘em
Grass can’t grow on the beaten track -
Why your girl’s pussy hairless;
I know those that’d kill their cousins just to get their sneakers back
Success sucks, excess; I don’t need the key to that
Dogs barking gotta grab em by the ruff
Give a fuck if ya man is buff, ring the fucking lighthouse
I always call the bluff, when I call I talk gruff
Feed these rap listeners, just like piggies at the trough
Bitches tremble at the clef, gotta keep your chin-up
See I’m about respect, they gettin pimped in the queue
Joining the talent pool with the rest
Wearing they ex Huf 5 panel while they waiting for the Heff
But the booty got stars, her ass tricks got Asterix attached like a Gaul
Pray before battle raps - the beef blessed I spit Halal
Yeh, BLESS-UP, ya’ll just Vikings I’m the Jarl
Good golly, Miss Molly you done fucked all my friends up
More than fucking Golliwogs fuck with your daughter’s heads
Just hood folly bitch prolly do nothing before thy end up
Caught and stuck in dolly shots, fuck bitch for nothing’s left
Truth be told your fiery raps
Should not sound like they came from a variety pack

[Hook]
Three blind mice; see how they run
Every which way to the witch’s house the smell entice
Uh, one by one she cook thrice
Anyone can lose their vision for the right price
You ever wonder, what Mother Hubbard’s canine picked
If she ain’t have a bone in her cupboard?
You think she had that Pedigree covered?
Nah, that dog became a hunter, muzzle got blood coloured

[Verse 3]
Coming for your neck that dog ruff
Innocence can be rugged, lack of bliss can be sweet
A strong entrance without a form of exit that’s defeat
I ain’t defeat too much winning just leaves me deplete
But these obstacles won’t have me obsolete
I do that myself when I’m giving all these props to peeps
Peep what your brother spoke
Seen what I loved once the other day but it don’t recognise me in the other coat
And I say that cuz since you left I added another layer
Only problem is I don’t feel like an artist, I’m just a painter
Doing odd jobs, always thought this rap was strange
Probably would’ve gotten that callback though, if I wasn’t out of range
I need a change, like poor fashion choice
I just get flashbacks of raps from Royce, loving my rhymes
But feeling I gotta lash my voice, the strap and rope I hang from
Lacks a hoist, so I fall forever
Blind in a bottomless pit feel like vermin seeking out the blender
Mash me up

[Verse 4]
Fitted out, until I remembered the cost of wearing to conceal the monster there-in, lies
Feel like I lost my bearing and rap became my foster parent
But put me up for adoption soon as they met him, he
Got tired out of caring they gave him the boot but still spared him
Carry a shank, cuz I gotta carve my own lane out there
Every man for himself, I’d rather take the cane and prepare
For beatings, my wealth is in the pain I bear, it’s laid out bare
On the track, don’t fade out there, don’t fade out there, don’t fade out there
We fade, the barber is prickly gotta watch how close he shave so near
Prickly got barbs watch the blade at the hair
Still caught in the trough feel wavy
Don’t look up to stars I look up to scars like I’m Seal’s baby
Means I respect the fight not the victory drinks in a chateau
Respect the climb not the plateau
What matters yo?? R.E.F in the Shadow
