New levels of stress im getting weeded now
Think im cheating on her got my girl freaking out
I see death in all directions
Cursed in this life that im blessed with

AYO THIS LOST GENERATION
Disconnected from myself trick knowledge got the young gods mind racing
Pacing, tryna figure out reality
Stressin, cursed in this life that im blessed with

... this the scripture
They pulled us over they say we fit the description
Looking out my vista, rizzlas all green like the riddler
Polo sport down in my pictures

My niggas chase death got nothing to live for
Except dollars, they spirituality ditched dust
Poof gone i drop shit niggas get pooped on
Sounding like i wrote this in the benz with the roof gone

Swiss chalet niggas grilling is chickes i skillet
The god skil level be, higher the wiz is
These niggas is cheese biscuits with whiskers
Always beside us, keep something thick in bawty riders

Come through like a giant and squash ya empire
Squash ya entire squadrons lost lifeless
Bars is like rikers while rappers slow like 50 tyson
Road to success hitchhikers

She say the mario pipe game boss level bison
M for mature rhyme liscense
Bury bars, bar burying, flow vikings
SYKE IM LIKE CUSHITE KINGS PEEP THE LIKENESS

Diamond since diapers, in my eyes wildfire
Got niggas shook up, shit ain't hard to look up
Dead presidents the only type im tryna pull up
Cuz live ones sold black men for white sugar

So yo i refuse to except refusals
Like i ain't really bouta refuse roots
But still niggas tryna rebuke truth
Like it dont matter now, WHAT WHERE WHEN WHY HOW WHO

Too much styles i can't hide it
Even if i tryed to please let me remind you
This is soul music, shit niggas cry to, shit niggas live to
SHIT NIGGAS DIE TO
