Cash Flow
[Hook:Slum Village]
This shit is for the willing dealing cash flow
Configured villain stealing the doe
And this is how live it ah ah a yo
We all about to get it ah ah the doe
This shit is for the willing dealing cash flow
Configured villain stealing the doe
And this is how live it ah ah a yo
And this we get it ah ah a yo

[Verse 1:T3]
Always rep the best of me to the death of me
Till the breath in me probably leave
I'll probably blow definitely
My sharp shooter flow
Punch a nigga on the ropes knock out
Then I tip my hat it's Indiana Jones
Hotter than a bitch shifless on a stove
Anything I said before was so motherfucken cold
You Crafmatic soft, I'm problematic dog
That you don't want to cross is bite is louder than his bark
Y'all know it's automatic go
Like a sticky foot petal thats wedge to the fucking floor
It's audible treats remarkable leeks
Volatile like a volcano I harness this heat
I'm like a magician a trick up my sleeve
This chicken they be checking me
Plus be checking my feed
Yeah , she know I'm secular a second breathe
I'll let her go like this flow i got is second to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Young RJ]
Yo it's a musical massacre
My mind a maze of amazing masterful
Lyrical razors my blade move faster brah
Leaving you faceless that face lift
John Travot Nicolas Cage shit
Melt the streets like that propane
Throw flames, monopolize like that board game
War games
Bang this turn it up a little bit now
Slum Vill in this bitch don't know body sit down
You feel this i know you do all up in your chest plate
No Barney Ruble rock your city like an earth quake
Break the scale the richter is too high to register
You ani't fam you my competitor
I got fleets studying critique
How be killing these niggas without the white sheet
Recipe young j cooking marvelous
My team roll as one talk shit
