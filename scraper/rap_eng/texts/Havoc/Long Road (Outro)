[Havoc]
I had to dig deep and go back so I took the long road
No music playin', just my thoughts tappin' around like Morse code
No navigation accomplice, everything I accomplish did it on my own
But wait, the higher power had to be in control
How I make it outta shit whole (shit hole)
To express to the world, n' tell 'em what I saw and expose my flaws
N' dirt you gonna get that back - and that's tenfold
If you keeping ignorin' your fuck-ups you make the same mistakes
Wind up in the same place
But always appreciate where I came from
It made me who I am today
