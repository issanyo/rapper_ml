[Emilio Rojas]
Ebola 'bout to make a lot of motherfuckers richer now
Because they profit when we sicker
And we all so busy texting and we still don’t get the picture now
The liquor filling up our livers
I told ‘em the FDA killed more than the NRA
And we be getting watched by the NSA everyday
I ride in the Heights and my people that selling weight
Their stash is easier to penetrate than Jenna Jameson
We motivated by sex, drugs and check stubs
Every tape that I put out sound like a Best Of
They hear the way that I rap and say I’m the next Pun
But I’m the first Emilio homie, I ain’t the next none
I’m sick to death of these strippers
That act like twerking'll make ‘em a better person
Than women that’s out here working
Got these girls thinking they ticket to get a Birkin
Is serving someone liquor so they hit their plastic surgeon
Don’t believe the shit, uh uh, we needing leadership
Or we gonna fall apart quicker than that IKEA shit
New York rappers confused, we sipping lean and shit
Call them fronts grills but we the first to ice our teeth and shit
It’s hoodie season, the winter come and we never cold
A stack on the jacket and 300 for the rig control
And I don’t ask for no favors, homie, I never owe
Run with outsiders and still pulling them centerfolds
Our dreams gotta be bigger than status symbols, yeah
I want generational wealth, I want my family set up
I want ‘em set up for life, life
Not doing shit for cash that get ‘em sent up for life
Nuh uh, I know people that hustle but got no savings
Nuh uh, and I know people that struggle and take vacations
‘Cause they plan better, they know we never had better
We look at our ancestors, the Africans, Aztecs and the Mayans
They built pyramids homie and we ain’t trying
Nah, we got excuses but where is the self-reliance?
And everybody needing the plug like an appliance
That’s why I'ont give a fuck who the flyest
Catch me sliding out the back with a squad with me, yeah
And I’mma lock the whole fucking city down like a quarantine
The army be, targeting poor minorities
Like Christy Mack, ain’t no escaping the war machine
Brrrat, them guns gon’ bang, woot woot, them drugs gon’ slang
The same block where them cops all aim
We waiting like if something’ll change but it never do
We waiting like if something’ll change but it never do
It’s hoodie season, New York’s a cold fucking city, let’s go
