[Verse 1]
People these days in a daze from the moment of their birth till the grave
From the moment of my birth I had faced
Grave situations-Gray is the color which I’m painting-in
Satan’s-sin-was not taking orders like minimum wage MC Donald workers
I’m filled from my rage like alcoholics, I’m filling the page with all my contents
I’ve risen through pain no longer content with life
My conscious is right while I write on this loose leaf,
I lose sleep thinkin of raps Blazin' the blue dream
I'm still in the blues like I was crippin'
She ripped off my blue jeans and blew where my gene is
I'm cocky on these writtens
Ohhhhhh well this just like orwell described it
I'm taking psyclobin while scribing this down
Enlightened I'm crowned as the king of babylon
This frighten you now

[Hook]
People watch the television till their vision blurs
They let it tell them fiction cause realities absurd
I lit a fucking spliff and let burn
I let my composition get the competition turnt (up)

[Verse 2]
R-E-M - D-M-T
Got my mind tripping cause I wanna chase dreams
I wanna chase dreams/ I wanna chase bank cause I wanna waste cream
I never chase hoes cause they always waste me, time
Re-wind to when I was little kid always got picked on
I picked on the music and used it to sit on this universe
I'm soon to burst - through the game - or through my head- just like cobain
I got no friends - I'm smoking solo lifting my soul high
I'm so high that I got the sun in my eyes like I was icarous I'm sick of this
Ignorance everybody ichabod I swear that
I'm just sick and tired of being tied down
I wanna fly now, disassociate from social weight
I'm loco with the motives of the younger child
I want the game

[Hook]
People watch the television till their vision blurs
They let it tell them fiction cause realities absurd
I lit a fucking spliff and let burn
I let my composition get the competition turnt (up)

[Verse 3]
Drones in the sky, that is a meta
For for the sheep I'mma Shepard
Moses a messan-ger with the words no one better
Till I aim the baretta and blam blam blam
Sam I am takin' the medicine you settled in our flouride water
The flow rides hotter than you've ever heard
I'm getting better - life is a bitch and she gettin wetter
She's feelin under the weather she's under my rain
Enlightened I came but she will never go so I sever throat
Ohhhhhh well this just like orwell described it
I'm taking psyclobin while scribing this down
Enlightened I'm crowned as the king of babylon
This frighten you now

[Hook]
People watch the television till their vision blurs
