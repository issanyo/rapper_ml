[Intro: Havoc]
Uh, yeah
Uh, huh
Hold on to it

[Verse 1: Havoc]
My hammer 007, it hit you how you spinning
Finished, line tape around my neck because we winning
Like the chain hanging down to my balls, you see it swinging long
My rap be stuck all in your head just like a sing along
But this is not a kiddy rap
Fuck with me show you how to get there like a city map
Just pay attention and you be half on with it
Hand over fists, never ever did we give a fuck
We lived it up, if we had to and we didn't have it, we stick 'em up
This the life we was living then, don't get it twisted
We can bring that motherfucker back and stick the clip in
I refuse to be a broke nigga, by any means
Run up in your crib like I had a second pair of keys
Crazy all the shit we been through and made it out
Never would I let my circumstances  fade me out

[Hook: Havoc]
I ain't even looking back, I highly doubt it
Let you niggas stab me in the back, I won't allow it
Speak my mind, never bite my tongue, that shit for cowards
Any time a nigga get the chance, I'm seizing power
I ain't even looking back, I highly doubt it
Let you niggas stab me in the back, I won't allow it
Speak my mind, never bite my tongue, that shit for cowards
Any time a nigga get the chance, I'm seizing power

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Bitch you acting like you ain't hearing tho'
Just read about me, this a different level, different glow
Yeah I be Audi in my foreign, love my money foreign
Made overseas, exchange my currency
And now it's double the G's
I remember pitching on the block
Sneaker money was a lot, yeah my little knot
Held it down, made me fiend for a lot more
Funny how you get a little paper they be dropping drawers
I carried on like a trooper, I just did my duty
Surviving shootouts
Some niggas had to fucking move out, they couldn't take it, yeah this place will wear a nigga down and strip you naked
Of your morals is a motherfucker, some never make it
Got to have a thicker skin for it, this not for suckers
Tell you like I told my baby boy, this guns and butter
I'mma shine like I'm supposed to shine, why wouldn't I?
Niggas out here like some fucking zombies, now look alive

[Hook: Havoc]
I ain't even looking back, I highly doubt it
Let you niggas stab me in the back, I won't allow it
Speak my mind, never bite my tongue, that shit for cowards
Any time a nigga get the chance, I'm seizing power
I ain't even looking back, I highly doubt it
Let you niggas stab me in the back, I won't allow it
Speak my mind, never bite my tongue, that shit for cowards
Any time a nigga get the chance, I'm seizing power
