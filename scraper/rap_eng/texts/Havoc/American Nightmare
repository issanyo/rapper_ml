[Intro: Havoc & Kool G Rap]
Get Money (money)
Get money (money)
(Uh)
Yeah

[Chorus: Havoc]
I see her gettin' money, hold a nigga down if she feelin' you
Only loyal to money, the only thing she appealin' to
Appetite for goons, life on the edge
No jumpin' the [?], just jumpin' bed to bed
America's nightmare, fat ass, pretty face
But you better watch her, the safe in a different place
Go 'head sleep, nigga, they stickin' you for the safe
She made you feel good but, nah, you ain't safe

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
She couldn't settle for the average, naww
She wanted a nigga with street status known to blow his ratchet
The nine-to-five nigga had no appeal to shorty
She turned on by the hood shit and gangster stories
She the bad bitch in the hood so nigga feed her ends
She ride passenger side in the Beamer or the Benz
A [?] nigga wanna put somethin' between her legs
The current cats she lovin' with fresh out the pen
The right nigga try to come wife her, she don't be listenin'
She more for the type in the kitchen gettin' that whippin' in
She 'bout courtroom and jail house vistin'
Shorty can move that scale, get your bail out, dividends
Every other night she bail out with different men
She all laced up, niggas keep her shit lit with gems
Back game crazy tight skirt with them [?] skins
Life is good now but that ain't how the story ends

[Chorus: Havoc]
I see her gettin' money, hold a nigga down if she feelin' you
Only loyal to money, the only thing she appealin' to
Appetite for goons, life on the edge
No jumpin' the [?], just jumpin' bed to bed
America's nightmare, fat ass, pretty face
But you better watch her, the safe in a different place
Go 'head sleep, nigga, they stickin' you for the safe
She made you feel good but, nah, you ain't safe

[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
Her appetite for gettin' dues grew bigger
Went from pictures, two niggas, to draw true figures
From hand-to-hand action to the big transaction
Niggas with Mac 10s inside of apartments in Manhattan
Dudes that get it crackin' like an action flick hap'nin
She seen bricks in the past now it's half her ass [?]
There with this Jamaican kid cat called Sebastian
The minute the kid drew a ripped Andrew Jackson
Told [?] to produce the other half when [?] straight wigged out and pulled two cigs out
The kids drew down too and blew down boo
Shorty wop caught a flesh wound, it went right through
Now, I'm prepared for this type situation
She didn't put chase in them dudes that put the cake in
A man caught a face shot, he on the floor shakin'
After the rapin' and ass penetration she ended up in several bags down in the basement
Bad body and your face, what a waste, man
They came and yellow-taped the place, fam
A young life lost, the price? Twenty eight grams

[Chorus: Havoc]
I see her gettin' money, hold a nigga down if she feelin' you
Only loyal to money, the only thing she appealin' to
Appetite for goons, life on the edge
No jumpin' the [?], just jumpin' bed to bed
America's nightmare, fat ass, pretty face
But you better watch her, the safe in a different place
Go 'head sleep, nigga, they stickin' you for the safe
She made you feel good but, nah, you ain't safe
