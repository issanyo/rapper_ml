[Verse 1: Tre Demond]
Niggas don't really know this shit, but fuck it
This is really the sample from Black Rose
I done fucked up and shook up the game
Like a Ku Klux I'm fucked up, I'm really killing all these niggas
Man these niggas ain't spitting the same
What a shame how Tremayne just raps sins on God's gravel
I drink a lot and take a bite out of Eve's apple
My Adam big, she can't get enough of these apples
You grocery storing while I'm Steve's Apple
In a world full of Androids, you fucking robots
I'm robust on these beats, man I should probably make y'all
Pay me every single time you hear a verse from a nigga
I just do this shit for free y'all get the word from a nigga
This is audio scriptures, pornographic pictures
Painting through my mind all the time on a nigga
Your bitch texting me saying,"Come Thru,"
When I finish  on this beat that's what I'm gon' do
So that's a heads up, keep your head up, It's LionGang
Niggas stars in their tweets but they're all lying man
I seen a nigga take a pic by a Benz car
I seen that nigga last week pushing shopping carts
You ain't got to lie for these hoes, dog. That's your fault
Never told a lie and that's why I got that phone call
I won't approach y'all on that he-say she-say
Only thing on my mind is how to get to Tinashe
I'm nasty and you know that, this Fuego Papi talking
All my niggas Mobb Deep, all your niggas talking bout me
Got a brain full of gems, I should open a jeweler
And these niggas getting weaker I should open it sooner
How the fuck I got this shit stuck in my medulla
Got a bitch so coldI nickname her My Cooler
One look now you froze I should name her Medusa
I ain't never gave a fuck 'bout niggas screaming Hakuna Matata

[Verse 2: Jimmy Mitch]
Cause I keep it jumping like it's hopscotch
They counting on my demise, give them a stopwatch
Young crock pot , I'm slow cooking
They be sure looking, I'm trying to get show booking
And the game is so crooked, they want you to fail
The only nigga dropping albums that be loathing themselves
You can't burn me, nigga. I be black to a crisp
When hungry niggas bite flows give them carcinogens
I'm full of adrenaline, crazy as fuck on the lyrics
Young nigga drunk off the spirits, they give me life I'm a live it
Sending shots is ridiculous, I'm a end it like period
I'm so dope you delirious, you a joke. Is you serious?
It's no hope if you're hearing this, you're supposed to be fearing us
Jimmy Mitch, Tre Demond, rap group of the year in this
That's LionGang to the lay, munching on Frito Lay
Studio be where I play, you other niggas stay away
I'm king of the castle, you're a peasant with cattle
I'm the nigga who taxing you while you barter and haggle
Take a walk in my shoes and nigga your toes will get bruised
You niggas rowing canoes, and I'm fucking snoring on cruises
Man what the fuck are you doing besides talking and shit?
You better watch up which tree you be barking and shit
And I don't know how to rap, I'm simply rhyming a sentence
I do it over and over until the music is finished
I guess they like what I'm saying, the playback meter's replenished
Funny the one you labeled boring then is all you be hearing
Time spent driving on me I'm the one who was steering
Nice guys finish last, this is just the beginning
Save all the women and children, because your ship is a sink
You niggas choking while you're floating, I got HM03
Nigga, SURF!
