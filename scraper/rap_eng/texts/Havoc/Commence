* As I commence to beat the sense in your elite defence, as a kid i've seen from a prism, hence no interest in a prison sentence, it's tense to be barred by a fence, I prefer to lay bare with phrase, cuz life's a game that ain't played fair, so, since daycare, i've raised hell, chilling with the funk, spinning cartwheels, drunk off cocktail, inhale, blow smoke in your face, another deadly rhyme to chase, always on search of the next crime that pays, whether in harmattan or ramadan, my next plot, design a bomb, to wreck the records thay rely upon, if i ever wind up on your playlist, flow dangerous, make you rewind a song, if you relate you could hum along, bust a lung, what's trust when you're plush with funds, and niggas get a rush to run with guns, it's real, society's ill and they can't find a cause, could be left with shots to the grill for tryna floss, could try but ain't defining us, we divine, like what you find in awe, my mind's a stage, take you on a tour de rhyme, i tell a story like once upon a time
