[Styles P]

Yeah! Vinnie Idol, Poobs... Big Bully, pimpin' what up? Jojo what up? It's going down, crazy. I empty my shits out nigga, feel me...

[Verse 1]

Psycho simply, please don't tempt me
To squeeze the shit off till it's empty
One by one, keep it coming nigga gun by gun
Ain't Run but it's my house nigga, please don't come
You ain't welcome here, four pound'll melt them here like grilled cheese
Real G's fuck around with heroin and realties
Coupes that was roofless, gangstas that was ruthless
Talk sense to 'em, or be mothafuckin' useless
Flying on the highway, Tokyo drifting floating
Sideways, coupes the same color as the Padres
Fitted in a jersey, yeah it's all tragic
How me and the gunplay like Magic and James Worthy (forreal)
But niggas you ain't worthy, niggas is pain worthy
I'm holding the thang sturdy and letting the thang curve me
Which means I will let it off, get it off
Got four bitches that get down like Latifah and set it off
Dope dealer dreams, with dope fiend schemes
I keep a OG gun, in my OG jeans
I blow a haze but I still keep a codeine lean
Which means I be tripping, fuck giving the whipping
Slip the clip in, start squeezing till niggas is dripping
And whichever niggas is dipping's a smart man
If you got heart man, five shots from the mothafuckin' cart-man
SP disguised in the trenchcoat
Whoever in the park, I be leaving the bench soaked
Nigga...
