[Hook]
It's the G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Alright now, pay attention to the crime rhyme Houdini P
Keeping you niggas in perspective
Mobb, representative, call me the specialist
Professional, professor at this rap science
Up in the laboratory, that's why your small rhyme bore me
Your store bought rap ain't shit, my category
Is that of an insane man who strike back
I draw first blood, it's over with, and that's that
You wanna square off, I'm saying 'slice that cat'
You get splashed from back of your head to ass crack
Searching for signs of the end, well I am that
Which bring, apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game but quite serious and yo in fact
You'll be running for dear life so far you might fall off the map
Fucking with P, you need the gat
At least you have the opportunity to bust back
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack a rare world premier
Shook individual bounce in blind fear
Scared to death niggas fall to they worst fear
Horror tales in Braille, for vision impaired
You looking for P, well, you can find him everywhere
In a project near you, I'll be right there
I was brought up and taught to have no fear (now)
Live wire niggas they behind me in the rear (now)
Cowardly hearts, step aside, stand clear (clear)
My bloodthirsty niggas got they eyes on you (you)
QBC, lime Bacardi, Godfather Pt. III
On some hashish, to Embassy Suite, crash your party

[Hook]
Yo, it's the G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing
Yo, it's the G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Yo, lime Bacardi, getting bent, crash the party
Handle B-I, bringing it to anybody
Physical damage, crowd control handle cannons
Hitting you ripped, leave your bloodstream contamin-ed
While you acting out of character, we observing
Grilling 'em down so hard, I know he felt it coming at 'em
Hennessy raps do like the Phantom
Running you up out of the spot in which you standing
Never second-guess a cat who hold gat
Concealed, but easily revealed and fast
Body casting raps to get your back snapped in half and severed
Impossible pain beyond measure
Sheisty living brought him to his last prayer (prayer)
Life changed around quick with one stare (stare)
Face full of fear, conquering your ice grill (grill)
Drowsiness, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil)
Given a overdose of this rap potent
Potentially dangerous, fatally left open
For the vultures, scavengers, that's EMS
Funeral homes, anticipating your death
That's the dead truth, check in the morgue, you'll find proof
Enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink
To the bottom, like hourly the Mob'll spot him
You know the routine, face up before I shot him

[Hook]
Yo, it's the G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing
G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing
It's the G.O...Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yo, that's a small thing
G.O.D. Father Pt. III
QBC, sip lime Bacardi
Heavy on the wrist, cube-link, my ice rink
Drama we bring, yeah, that's a small thing
Small thing...what?
