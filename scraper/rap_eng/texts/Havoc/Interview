Verse

Ok Gambian artist e legi nyai pa neka waiters

Senn song yi waha tung dara ludul bari haters

Artist love the record without no pay

Baking powder alone can never bake cake

KSMG ma team we moving each and every day

We gat only gays in the dem Runway

Lokalo ma nigga thanks for your panda clash

The so call rap-king is an out cast

The big headed Gee legi warr ngaii am class

Bori wah muna dull da ngai reeh ba tass

Open mic üé§ festival what the fuck is this???

Artist are left out mein why u doing this

Lots of talents are waste, carried away

That‚Äôs why i will never stop lyk (captain Zimbabwe)

Give me pen give me book let me write this pain

U understand that in this hood u need to be fame

Dancehall thing really nice keep it up men

Wayea sen patua yu jahaso yena muna fen

Brain cracker,cracker sh*t

Boy legi dafa doi, started hardcore wayea legi yepa noi

Ragal mic bi teh dem

Bul fi neeka tooyi, noy nyu den yaga di job yaga di nyaha toyy

Killer Ace u back but nothing never change

I‚Äôve been leading this game since that i came

Gam music u lose y u never gain

Why no place for hardcore but only entertain

Leaving our culture goin for the new

Pretending to be others why we are derr bu nyuol

Youths are dying to make it listen to the news

Kufi wah wahi anything nala nyus

Ruling all ur teams like a lion in d jungle

Artination stand back your chances are little

Song bi sula naharai sula nehai dogul

Am the rap god so ko waydi lajal ndeyi google

Industry nyaka presenters u  mandu

But we gat the real one ‚òù shootout DJ KANU

DJ‚Äôs yi di compete kuneka ak sound effect eii gun nam

Bu Jolly-boy di gayna feleh ak english yu bonamm

Music bi nyu warr ko jel konenka def ko kon domam

Wai dn koi hide banj mu seeu drop ko si condom
