[Intro: Havoc]
Yeah
Yeah
H.A.V.O
Uh
It's like that
It's like that
Here we go
Yeah

[Verse 1: Havoc]
You cowards fragile but they beg to differ
Crack 'em open like a egg and throw 'em in the mixer
Show 'em that real grind, that real grind
Drug traffic, did a buck passed the yield sign
Pay lawyers gave us the right away
Got knocked, we was back out right away
They see the lighter, day brighter, they in the tunnel ending
What I went through left a nigga with some heightened senses
Kevlar vests, the life of ratchet been us
Since Champion hoodies we never fucked with Discus
Anywhere we rock you know we had that bitch lit up
Niggas fronting like they up, they muddy, got the hick ups
Traded in my heart for a igloo
Frost bit feelings, parked far from their issues
That you hold dear, I could give two fucks
That's all a ho get out of me
Cause every bitch is foul to me

[Hook: Havoc]
Cause I was told never trust a mothafucking soul
I don't even trust myself, that shit is cold
Havoc, best story that never been told
True shit, ya niggas been lying to them hoes
Faking this, nah making it, fuck ya niggas on?
One eye open when I sleep and never yawn
As I creep with the heat, the safety's off
Ya niggas better watch ya back, that's word to God

[Bridge: Havoc]
That's my word nigga
You niggas better watch they mothafucking backs
You heard
Niggas talking all that fly shit

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Fuck your feelings, give a fuck, I done murdered mines
Ya bust a shot up in the air and wouldn't hurt a fly
Def by design, son i'm fly with it, I'm messy with it
Let you niggas know I mean the business
Got 'em going through the motions, heart beating rapid
Starve a ho, send her to you, let you feed her captain
We wildin' in these streets police they can't contain us
This shit is all up in our blood, the odds is in our favor
Live with it, deal with it punk bitch
Heard you went to jail on some chump shit
How you in the streets like you run shit?
Handle that, matter fact, 'bout to dump a clip
Hold it down for my city, hold it down for 'em
Scream it loud, every time i'm out of town touring
Don't get it fucked up, Havoc who I be
Never believe what I hear and half of what I see

[Hook: Havoc]
Cause I was told never trust a mothafucking soul
I don't even trust myself, that shit is cold
Havoc, best story that never been told
True shit, ya niggas been lying to them hoes
Faking this, nah making it, fuck ya niggas on?
One eye open when I sleep and never yawn
As I creep with the heat, the safety's off
Ya niggas better watch ya back, that's word to God
