[Verse 1: Stevie Bucks]
I only seen tough nights, hard times
Feds trying to give a nigga hard time
When I got the four, its Bret Favre time
I ain't stopping till you niggas know its are time
I live great times, crime since age nine
I been hustling ever since grade nine
I used to sell marijuana those is grave times
Life lessons, seen through the grave vine
Got a little older, started taking orders
From a older head, who gave me boulders
And he told me take them quarters
Cause if a fiend have change
It could still make a change in my life
I could walk to the mall for a bill
Now everytime they call its for a billing up
My life changed, that’s why I’m still billing up
Only real niggas feel my tempo
And if the cops take notes watch me steal they pencil

[Hook: Stevie Bucks]
I’m getting up(x4)
And getting money out this game
I’m getting up
And getting money out this game
I’m getting up (x7)
And getting money out this game
I’m a ghetto child yeah

[Verse 2: Stevie Bucks]
Its an eye for an eye
But I’m blinded, reminded
About the days when I had no clothes to iron
I had a one two but it wasn’t my style
I didn’t have it but I still had the mind style
Now the dollars make niggas copy my style
I’m trying to win like when girls do they eyebrows
Cause if I fucked up, I fucked up, my lucks up
A Bruce Lee nunchucks
Yo I drop knowledge on you dumb fucks
I’m getting college from a dumb slut
I’m fucking raw like a bum fuck
I squeeze clips when I hit the beats
By the time it hits the streets
Yo, you niggas only doing gun buts
I’m fucking shocking like when nuns fuck
I fucking shot him if he dumbs up
I’m fucking rotten when the Sun’s up
I’m getting noggy when the Sun’s down
I close my mouth and put my funds down
Stevie Bucks
A G5 in this

[Outro: Stevie Bucks]
I’m a ghetto child yeah(x3)
