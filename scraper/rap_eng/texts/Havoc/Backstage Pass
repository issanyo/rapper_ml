[Intro: Prodigy]
Hahahah, ahh, ay ay, come here bitch
Woo, yeah I'm talkin' if you don't talk what you do shorty

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid; they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50 and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said "Thanks"
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggas bringing me they girl like, "You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-Unit!"
Man, little groupies, they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel, unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick

[Hook 2X: Prodigy]
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl, I know I seen your face before
Turn around - yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Shorty what's up? You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm tryna fuck, if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up, in the telly you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that, yeah I'll work that, work that

[Verse 2: Havoc]
It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaigne
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up 'til you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number, she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nutt on her neck
They don't call us the master of the tour for nothing
We destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus
Here's the hot line bitch, call us

[Hook]
