[Produced By Havoc]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
You can never understand the mind state
My goal is to increase the crime rate
And work at a fast pace, no time to think twice
Catch the fool blinkin' and he will be iced
For tryin' to play tough on the menu
But I can see the trick within you
I break it down to a science, word is bond
Nine times out of ten says you'll never see your life again
I'm ready to die, and ready for all y'all
If you think you ready to try to push the God to the limit
But I ambush and hit hard and bust shots in it
You didn't really want to get involved with a gunfight
Praying to God that you could live a long life
But I put the knife to your throat and proceed to cut
While you're bleedin' on the floor with your mouth shut
And what?

[Hook]
*scratches* Pumpin' mad slugs

All we do all day is
All we do all day
All we do all day is

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Step through the door, gettin' set for '94
With the mind of Saddam, hardcore, bringin' war
So cock your pistol, I'm accurate like a Scud missile
I'll leave a cop killer lost in your brain tissue
Therefore, say no more, I'm the raw
Kid with skills, give you more than what you came for
My crew got my back so when you pop
This Glock kicks hollow tips, hittin' you up real quick
I chill on the hill, mind my own but still
Stay your point, keep my steel cocked and ready for real
I stay trife and walk the projects at night
Livin' right? Son, they want to take my life!
I'm paranoid, damn sure ain't the weed I smoke
It's the phony mother fuckers, while I'm on, they're broke
I see 'em starin', with their heat to try to get bold
Starin' at my gold, so the heat I hold tight like a mic
When I rhyme, commit crimes tonight
Threw a bid on my head? Pump lead
Leave your whole town red, bust a vessel instead
I choose, you lose when I squeeze
The enemies, them blow to fumes
Spark a L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black, Paddyshop, light it up

[Bridge: Big Noyd]
Big Noyd in the house, representin' Mobb Deep
Either smokin' a black or the bluey one-twoey
Lightin' it up, light the weed and make a cloud (x4)

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
You got a lot of heart boy, all that yappin'
Actin' like it can’t happen
It’s brothers like you who fail to realize the realness
So, now I got to deal with this
Back when I was younger, I used to get stuck
But now the tables turned and I make the beef duck
Quit stealin' all you who want to try and play me
I bet you if I hit you with the pound you’d obey me
You must be smokin' dust, my crew will flip for days
And bust your face open in various ways
I’m in too deep, ain't no if, what if, maybes
And if you got a kid then the P is killin' babies
And after that, relax and get puffed out
But watch your step 'cause you could still get rubbed out
Stop frontin', get a Tec to your grill
For real, you ain’t ill, I know the deal
Puff a fat L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black, Paddyshop, lightin' it up

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Havoc]
I leave your brain in a faze, call me, dead
Your mind can’t find out project side, that’s when I climb out
Be on a flow in the Ac, the two, either one, two
Ay Black, that’s where they got that stay high
Keep my mind in the sky, straight are the corrupt
Front on this kid and you get bucked
Left stuck off the raps I kick, Queensbridge kid, you dig?
And rocks into the head, take a swig
I’m bent, stay hard, and if we bump into any shorties
All I want to know is if there’s any skins to barb
I live the high life, keep my mind right, do my dirt at night
Forget the pull, word is bond, it’s on
Queensbridge representin' with the automatic fullies
Weapons we pack, more cracks and flip G-packs
Get that loot kid, what you gonna do
When my whole crew is blazin' at you?
’Cause it’s whole crews we run through
I'm ill like Tommy Hill but brothers can’t figure the facts
Fake Jacks, you’ll get ten in your back
I react like a maniac, strapped with macs
It’s what the petty tip you on cause I'm not on it like that
I just chill, what the Hell? Everybody want to be a gangster
Step to Havoc and step into the Zone of Danger
They get blown with the banger
You been on a whore too long, a buck fifty flippin' on me
'Cause everywhere I go son, it’s time for me to flip
Loose lips ain’t shit, aim a nine and don’t miss
I learned to hold my own, protect my dome from beef
I’m quick to squeeze my piece, when the beef get deep
I get down for my crown in a minute
Wanna start drama; wants my gun? Imma end it!
And all this time, I been smokin' Drum, to relax my mind
I’m stressed like a motherfuck, niggas get bucked
On the ave, cause Queens niggas don’t give a fuck
And if you didn’t know by now, Queensbridge is where I’m from
The place that stars are born and phony rappers get done
Spark an L, burn a brain cell, love love
Ay black, Paddyshop, lightin' it up

[Hook]
