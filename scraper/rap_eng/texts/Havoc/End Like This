[Hook: Havoc 2x]
Why I gotta end like this? 2x
Used to be my muthafucking heart
Why I gotta end like this?

[Verse 1: Esteban The Moor]
I was born years ago in 1994
Dying to live, living to die, it’s an exchange door
I put my soul in every rhyme, I put my soul in every song
God, I ain’t trying to live my life long
In Hip-Hop history I’m trying to put my name
Making my tracks remarkable, so they won’t call me insane
Hope my love to the hood, will only grow with time
U better get yours, cuz I’mma, cuz I’mma get mine
I’m living by the rhymes, not living by the bullet
How many shots my brotha will pull it?
Finger on the trigger, hate is on his mind
He prays to the Lord, but to the Devil he’s already signed
He thinks by killing sun will shine brighter for him
The doors got locked, he let people scream
What if I was there, what if he shot me?
After losing so much blood, he probably stopped me!

[Hook: Havoc 2x]
Why I gotta end like this? 2x
Used to be my muthafucking heart
Why I gotta end like this?

[Verse 2: Esteban The Moor]
Death is just a word, strugglers die like panthers
A lot of questions, mistakes, we go to church for answers
Having so many dreams of death. Is it near me?
I’ll die being on top? I want to know it clearely
2Pac, Biggie, Eazy-E and Big L
Souljaz never die, souljaz can return from hell
Somebody told me that I can die like those 4
But I know it will be at the end of my 7th tour
After I’ll finish couple albums and a book
After I’ll bring Nanci Fletcher on the hook
Ash to ash, but my soul will live forever
If I pass away, be ready, wait for stormy weather
They will not judge me by my actions
Just shoot me dead, cuz of the fan’s love reactions
I know I’ll be surely missed
But why I gotta, why I gotta end like this?


[Hook: Havoc 4x]
Why I gotta end like this? 2x
Used to be my muthafucking heart
Why I gotta end like this?
