Uh, walking down (?)
Call me Gandhi one more time
I bring the shiv to your fucking neck
People really like to disrespect
Cuz they see me; short, fat, and I be mad ugly
So what that I'm ugly?
It don't mean that I can't be hard and I kill you

Call me Gandhi one more time
I'll bring the shiv to your fucking neck
People talk a lot of shit nowadays, that's disrespect
I don't tolerate, man you really like to playa hate
Why you always gotta say a thing?
Just because I am somebody that's not the same as you
This is called discrimination, segregation
Similar to how we view ourselves
Man the way that we talk the shit
It's kinda crazy, I wish people really learned to love each other
And I learned it from Lil B
But a lot of people, man I don't think they know Lil B
Rest in peace to the Based God
Even if he died, he'd still be best rapper alive
Man he so raw, plus he remind me of myself
Man I really do love the kid
Baby, thinking that I'm Gandhi
Call me Gandhi one more time and I shiv you

Teach me to represent
Cuz I got mad love for myself, that's called pride
Man I survive where I live and
Never go past (?) and (?) Street
Never stay past my two blocks
I had my basketball stolen in 6th grade, fuck it all
Fuck the world that they told me
Man I'm not the homie but I never try to play me
Never try to play you
Man it's Gandhi, call me that one more time I kill you

This the life that I'm livin' in
When I'm growing up, man I am really same person too
Ever since I was 15
Now I'm 29 and I really still hate myself
Ain't nothin' that crazy tho
Yo, call me Gandhi one more time and I kill you

This how I fucking feel every time as an Asian in America, everybody black and white
They say the same thing all the time
Either you act one way or another, that's what make life
Whatever, either way that's not me
Trying to be myself, this world is quite cruel
Trying to place me in boxes, that's obnoxious
Man the shit I do mad real
Nobody ever live like me
They say I'm weird and I'm stupid just because I be myself
I don't even really give a fuck
Sometimes I'm corny, but that really don't mean no shit
I don't even need to say a thing
I be telling people that I represent when I don't tho

Call me Gandhi one more time
I may not react violent, but I will kill you
I'll find ways to do the thing
Like in Breaking Bad, I put mad poison in your child's drink
Or the other lady at the end, I might have ruined it for some of us who haven't seen it
Should've said "SPOILERS"
Either way, Breaking Bad probably that's like my favorite show
Man I really love Heisenberg, plus Aaron Paul; he really good at acting
Man I really fucking love the show
Season five was the best, I loved each episode
Yeah, Baby back and I'm chilling tho
Call me Gandhi one more time, I kill you

This the flow I was born with
God kissed me on the head and he said I was the best
That's why I think I'm so nice
Lot of people think they nice, but not really as nice
That's why I be chillin' tho
Make a couple hundred thousand while I be in the pharmacy
Uh, and I'm behind the counter, knowing mad drugs
Yeah I know all the shit
Looked up guidelines for hypertension
Lot of people got hypertension, that's too much tension
Plus the stress, plus they got high blood pressure
I recommend mad different medications, different drugs you can take to complete that
To compel yourself to get a better health system
Or a better life for yourself so you could live longer and play with your little kids
Baby really be chillin' tho, counting mad millions
Y'all do not know me
