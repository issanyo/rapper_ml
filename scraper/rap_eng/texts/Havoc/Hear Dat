[Verse 1: Havoc]
Yeah, uh huh
Let's get it
Ain't nothing like the grind and seeing how your hard work pay off
You never take a day off and ball like the playoffs
Anybody frontin' you know these things gonna spray off
Motherfuckers thought they knew me but nah they just way off
Niggas show they cards, yapping out the mouth
And quick to talk about a life they ain't even 'bout
Wonder why niggas try'na run up in they house
Gotta do your math on a bitch before you pick a spouse
Some of these hoes straight nut rags
And have you tied up in the crib butt-ass
Shit be so real, I be dead-assed
24-7 yeah, I was built to last
Get money give a fuck how a hater feel
My team give it up out here and straight real
We take care of our own and never pop off
Cop a bar motherfuckers knock a block off

[Hook]
Got to do what you got to do, I hear that
When them things cock back you better hear that
Niggas want they block back, yeah I hear that
Niggas dead on that, did you hear that?

[Verse 2]
I got another thing for money and can't nobody change that feeling
People see you on top, some of them'll catch feelings
Middle finger up to the sensitive
Go fuck yourself, dose of your own medicine
I'm on a cheddar binge, never was I settling for less
'Cause anything less is just stress
Fuck distractions and the company you keep
We play for keeps, fuck you and your little beefs
Trying to grab at something your arms can't reach
? are the places me and my niggas feast
We don't go hard, we beast
Hopefully you could leave in one piece
'Fore this shit get deep
Niggas dig they own grave like it's part of their belief
So I say rest in peace
See you bitch-ass niggas when you try to come at me

[Hook]

Never gave a fuck how a nigga felt
Bout my paper, big H, you know how it's spelt
Hustle the shit out this hand I was fucking dealt
And it's all about the team, we don't go for delf
