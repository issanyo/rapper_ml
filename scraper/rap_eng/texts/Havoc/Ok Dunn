Havoc:
Yeah, check it out like this you heard?

Prodigy:
Woo! Infamous records, yeah son...

Testing one two, one two, that's what I'm talking about...
Mobb Deep, yeah... Clinton Sparks

This is H right here, got P by my side you heard?
Uh huh, let's do it like this check it out, get familiar
Clinton Sparks dunn, what up dunn? Get familiar...

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Hav spit it, Hav live it, Hav pushing it to the limit
You a gimmick, get the shitted smacked out of you with linden
I been it, scoop you off of your pivot, the four fittith, all get it
When your monkey ass pass the line of scrimmage
We invent it for the palm and dead it until the ending
I ain't running even if the illest repertoire is mentioned
My weapons aren't like yours, my handles don't wipe doors
I coming through blocks nigga, section shit off
Them streets and the gloves don't ever come off
The strong overcome the weak, accept the laws
Mami want a gangster, she be looking at a boss
Homie front, there will be bodies, more
The stones on my cross, you gonna get it
Catch you in the club slitted
While you tricking, get up on them Jigga, your man's with me
H A V O the new Mobb
Your worst nightmare, trucks wrapped in camouflage, bitch

[Hook x4]
"Mobb Deep, Mobb Deep"
Yeah Ok Dunn, Ok Dunn, Ok Dunn

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Ayo word so many niggas got so much beef
That when you come out, you better ring the police
Better keep one in your head, and turn off the safeties
Learn how to sleep light because we're waking
And tape up your kids and your relatives
Get on some ruthless shit, I need sedatives
To calm me down, wind me down
Imma find you even if it takes months on a stakeout
We hitting in the club, we out and about
We're bound to see you homie, walk with your gun out
Industry bitten, you're just like a chick
With her nose up, I squeeze on you and if you live dunn...
It's over... We're coming back for more of that bullets...
That murder, it'd be a wrap for your bitch ass

Infamous records, Clinton Sparks, what up?
