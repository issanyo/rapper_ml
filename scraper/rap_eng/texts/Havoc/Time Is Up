Sick of working eight hours a day
Sick of working for minimum wage
Pray to God there's got to be a better way
Pray to God that something in my life will change

Time is up
The door is open
Time is up
Where am i goin

The change has come
I pray it's his perfect plan
The door is opened
And put me in another band
We're gonna hit the road
We're gonna play some shows
Where we go nodoby knows

I cannot help myself
What will the future bring?
Where is the open door?
Where are you taking me?
Time is up
