[Verse1: BiG O]

Uh
Struggling Since Birth as I came into this earth
How you trynna make it pure, when we livin in a curse
B-I-G O kicking it in with this one verse
SSB they fear us when we coming through
Never the doubt I'll be buzzing when I'm with my crew
1 and 2 they trynna screw,plus the cash rules everything around me "CREAM"
Known to be Supreme and my clique imperial, I'm a killer you ain't gotta add the serial

[Verse 2: Shaman(A.Asakura)]

Serial bitch

Uh, Sha, yeah, uh

Double S B, I believe everybody's heard of us
Killers on the beat we some motherfucking murderers
Immortality you could never ever murder us
Beastly on the beat, like my middle was Cerberus, Cerberus
You're serving us some early love,no need for herbs to puff
Iim flyer than the the birds above,you fuckin punks are outta luck
If you fucked up one of us,close like kids and cops
So any enemy is getting touched, like ipods in a apple shop
Or top models and photo-shop, we some cellabate monks
You could never ever fuck wid'us

[Verse3: Th@ Yung Chase]

Fuck, wit us look

It's the return of the old school, you old news
I own you and your team bitch,you know who this be
It's SSB we on the come up fuck the mainstream
If it's beef my niggas will run up,pull they gun up
Blaow blaow that's two niggas they fucked up(BRUUUUOUUUUUUUOOUUUUUU)
[Lyrically I'm on a level above ya](pending)
[The "Sick-Teen" bout to gun ya](pending)
Born in a place where to get P is move that ganja
Or kill another negro, for what he got
Weather it be a g-shock or his rocks
Whatchu know about comin up in these blockz
With my nigga O, trynna make this dough, from spittin in the yo
Niggas hatin but SSB we about to blow

[Hook:BiG O/Sha]

They're scared to battle, they're scared to look
Cause ain't no such things as half way crooks(Biatch)
They're scared to battle they're scared to look
Cause ain't no such things as half way crooks

[Outro:BiG O] Double S B Out'chea
