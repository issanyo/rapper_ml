VERSE:

Right in ya face, lighting jays, i'm the tidal wave
Title belt rocking speeding past em fucka right of way
Queens love the lo sport tees we plug em right away
Ya biggest obstacle a minor maze, u a vagina

Slave, Raz light the haze in designer frames
Gobble beats til' i catch the Itis, leave em
Wifeless strike it like em trying prep a heimlick
Recite diamonds, bite it catch dat gingivitis, young

Titans connect like hyphens, in fly ciphers
My dime got that cleopatra likeness make ya eyes widen
You joes biting, the presidential the main
Source this the elemental, metaphysical spiritual

Lyrical shots turn cats back to minerals
Don't cross the general, clock loot in intervals
Rock jewels dat figaro, talk smooth like jigallos
Yall crews is imbeciles, LP's is pitiful

We roll thru in hilfiger scripts & emblems
...hoe troops in sleek swim suits we drilling em
....lo goose and wheat Timbo's the minimum
Snakes is slithering, bake cakes thats sizzling

Gentlemen 97 airs bucket hat grilling em
Burn blunts infront of peel police with the ignorance
Spit detergent if i cuss its still the clean version
...niggas know my team working, ugh

Tommy fleece palm on the lo bag handle
Fly dude but im from the gravel, my chick
Look like a gold statue, rest my head let my
Soul travel, u tryna ball but got no handles

Im like the pope inna lo flannel dual wielding
Mics den i go Rambo, its like a vine how my
Gold dangle, its so divine when my flow grab u
Rings on my fingers sticking out like i sport camels

Fluoride in my tap, I sip the peardrax
...layed back in the cut, like a scab nigga
The black arab inna scarab, my chick clothes
Transparent, i skipped class before feris

Chillin, wavy off the alcholic serum, yo
Niggas, cherish the flow like a heirloom
I stroke ya queen impair her cerebellum
Deaf dumb and blind, my peers is all Hellen

Mackin relentless my tommy 3m reflecting
Like cross guard vests, backwoods
In the back pocket while i'm sagging my guess's
Concerts is church they run to the front for the blessings

Told my wis peep the bobby hemmit, im tryna
Build like a contracter, in gold lenses kush
Psychadelic modern day jimi hendrix the club
Famililia the illest nigga no exceptions
