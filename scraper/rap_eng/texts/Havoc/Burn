[Hook: Base]
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
Everyone know how it's going down
Yo my time coming man, I'm just flowing up to the crown
Any opposition gonna go and hit the ground
All I gotta do is show up with the killer sound
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn

[Verse 1: Endo]
See my name Endo, and Base my equal
See ya not scary, not ya mans, no peoples
See we done popped cherries like Maraschino
And we done killed bills like Tarantino
And we done swung bats like the great Bambino
So the crack won't leave you killed like the Carter was Nino
Put a scar on your face like Al Pacino
Cause we stack chips like cans of Pringles
And we got chips up at casinos
You running with birds and we running with eagles
Initializing a visual style
And visual violence, creating mystical silence
Apocalyptic defiance and all my clients
Got a grip around the value of science
Despite it I fight it, we decided it's lit, so...

[Hook: Base]
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
Everyone know how it's going down
Yo my time coming man, I'm just flowing up to the crown
Any opposition gonna go and hit the ground
All I gotta do is show up with the killer sound
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn

[Verse 2: Base]
It's survival of the fittest when I'm spitting off these writtens
Always on my game like I'm pissed and they moving like pistons
I got them doing what I want, to go and see my vision
Don't you ever mess with me, I'll poop on ya like pigions
Recently, I been on my music thing homie
Not to flex on ya, most of ya just below me
Don't think I didn't see through, lots of ya baloney
So phony, not only did ya show me, man I kill you slowly
The way I'm murdering MCs, they ain't dead yet
Murder through the head, they tryna fit in like it's tetris
Thinking isn't safe for me, it's clear you haven't met this
5E still wanna run up on me and try and test this
Hip hop, always gonna be some competition
Valedictorian of verbal communication and composition
I'll slaughter everyone just to show I'm the top position
Who gonna tap first? Everyone in a locked position

[Hook: Base]
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
Everyone know how it's going down
Yo my time coming man, I'm just flowing up to the crown
Any opposition gonna go and hit the ground
All I gotta do is show up with the killer sound
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn
We let it burn, we let it burn
We let it burn, burn b-b-burn

[Verse 3: Base]
Top 5E and everyone like Popeye's
This 5 is on the loose, while the rest is on the noose
Hanging like silly goose, I ain't afraid to name names
The top 5? Easy, Urban, Ricky, Tey
That's including my name, who's that last spot given?
After this I ain't asking for ya forgiveness
I don't care or bet, you can get off my friends list
Just an achievement I can check off my checklist and
I usually don't rattle off my disposition
But this is what happens when I'm put right into this position
Musician, killer physician, man imma chef
Cause the booth becomes a kitchen, right when I'm spitting
This is to the fakes and right to the doubters
I'd rather you bring no damn funeral flowers
Ya tough now but in the booth you're all cowards
Punchlines damaging like a meteor shower
I can do it in less than 24 hours
I'm coming for the save like my name is Jack Bauer
All of a sudden everyone think imma compete now
What the hell's this, the world's pettiest beef now?
Came to teach, preach, I'm spittin' heat
From the east, bouta feast on the weak
At my peak, have them playing hide and go seek
But they don't know that I got heat seeking missiles
I'm shooting them off and I'm just letting them whistle
And when it blows up man, when it blows up
We just gonna let it go and burn

[Outro: Endo]
Yea it's Fahrenheit 451
Ya better put icee and Kool-Aid
We burning everybody
