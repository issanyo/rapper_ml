[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, I rose early mornin', spread my wings yawnin'
Vague memory of last night now it's all dawnin'
Look down and see dry blood all on my garment
It stained up my Guess formers, Kevlar'd enormous
I hopped up outta my bed holdin' my head
Flashbacks of gun shots shot past my head
I can recall an eight man brawl, three men fall
Bullets flew I had to drug my man behind a wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?

[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write recites every day life
Queensbridge streets at night even more trife
Hold me down son, never let sleep, danger lurk
Niggas creep, doing they dirt never in peace
By my self foreverly bent, pores leaking with the foul liquor scent
Losing track of loot I spent, but ain't no time for that
It's '96 get on point like a motherfucker similar to pyramids
You listening? Eh yo, its on like that
You know the saying: Once you bust gat no turning back
Pop you, till they drop and it there ain't no stopping
Hit em up, fill them with the slug toxin
Eyes in back of my head steadily watching
Pass the heat to the clique, assist like John Stockton
And let the Mobb take you to the hoop
We coming straight up the middle, end one no doubt true


[Verse 3: Prodigy]
I kick reality shit that you could feel like you're holding it
Grab a hold of this grip tight like its your last bit
Futuristic, high tech computer chip lyric, its beyond the year 2000
Some dominant, confident niggas is conquering
Overminding, my Mobb done did it again
Vertical raps straight up and down
My wolf pack 'll go at the whole globe attack the map
Ambassador P, with strengthly, strip your sleeve of your stripes
You're branded for the rest of your life
Now you can sit back and cherish the time that we spent
A foul memory of timb boots, rights and lefts and razors
Your face get open from B.I
Maniac niggas get clapped and sent to triage
The story of my life, crew got shot, stabbed with knife
Make a weapon out of anything and take your life
Violence follow me like the bitch from Fatal Attraction
It seems I attract drama so action
Let's begin World War III
Mobb Deep, Infamous Mobb, Rapper Noyd, Q.B.C
My crew immune to this shit, mega guns fight every night
Faggot ass niggas is dykes, nigga, word up
