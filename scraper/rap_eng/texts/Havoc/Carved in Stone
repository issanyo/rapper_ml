[Intro: Prodigy]
We gettin’ our burn
Here we go again
I bet y’all saying to y’all self: “The fuck these niggas last so long, man?”
And my response to that is, I palms don’t ever stop itching, nigga
You know, it’s about that you hear it right now, so…

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
We back, people, for more money, more jewelry, more vehicles
Less hangers on, tag-alongs, and leech dudes
We back minus that weak label trying to hold us back
Now we gettin’ more profits every unit shipped
You gettin’ returns, your album ain’t movin’ shit
We gettin’ our burn in places we don’t even live
We learn you niggas on this game and how to stay afloat
We teach you clowns about some things that y’all don’t know
Like how to bang out songs for 12 years straight
And that’s not all—they all gotta be gangsta
Consistent anthems, put us up against whoever
We got a thing for competition, only make us better
And better and better, I know you can’t believe your ears
You pinching yourself, but doggie, this is all real
Convincing yourself that we Cell Block 4 thugs
Man, that’s how the last nigga got bucked

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Homie, don’t get it twisted, I been gettin’ money since ’90
‘Fore Magic retired and Lakers head coach was Pat Riley
I bone a bitch then bounce, baby girl, don’t mind me
If you mad, take it up with God, that’s how designed me
I’m multi-talented—fuck you think Jive signed me?
The only thing grimey is that pen that you write with
Got your main hoe two-waying me on my Sidekick
Talking how she fuck you but she really don’t like it
About my paper when it come to that hustle, I all-night it
If I ain’t been through it, yo, Havoc won’t bite it
I can’t keep it real for shit, but everything happens for a reason
So I won’t wifey the wrong bitch
I’m a bastard, pimpin’ in a Caddy 16
I’m a bastard, pimpin’ in a Caddy 16
Y’all know nothin’ ‘bout it, make the Maybach look weak
With compartment secretly designed to stash the heat

[Hook: Havoc]
Yo, these niggas know my style—fuck is wrong with you, doggy?
Know these cannons’ll blast off and make this place foggy
Have everybody in this bitch cramped in the door
I just introduce myself and let the hammer applaud
Yo, niggas know my style—fuck is wrong with you, doggy?
Know these cannons’ll blast off and make this place foggy
Have everybody in this bitch cramped in the door
Running for life, amazing how you could move the crowd with the 4
