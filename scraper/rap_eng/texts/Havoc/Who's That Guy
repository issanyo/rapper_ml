[Verse 1: R.A. the Rugged Man]
(Rugged Man have it, Mobb we infamous)
Yo, the Jess Franco of hip hop, leave you faceless
Torture chambers, sadist in the basement
Rugged Man, who's the foulest? Who's the rudest?
I grip my dick while I do this, HG Lewis
The two thousand maniacs, who this?
Blood feast, old school splatter, occupation
Famous rappers, straight razors, we dead broke, we playa haters
Violaters, up your bitch pussy with vibrators
That's why they hate us, scum dripping
Under age, coogi sticking, pussy licking, put the clip in
I take a shit on your album when it drops
Plus your whole crew is pussies, like Suffolk County cops
Suffolk County, meets Queensbridge, don't be foolish
Rugged Man, Jack Johnson, Joe Louis
R to the A, no life, lowlife
The pretty bitch offender, the fat bitch complementer
Top five lyrical contender, the lyricist's career ender
White trash trailer park representer
Who can stop this? Who rock this? Who lock this?
Who got the Glock? Who cock this? Lucio Fulci
R.A. the Rugged Man (on the reals)
Rugged Man, Havoc (no doubt)

[Hook: Havoc x2]
(Who's that guy?)
A nigga you don't wanna fuck with
(Who's that guy?)
Four pounds will make 'em duck quick
(Who's that guy?)
Getting lifted at the bar, no doubt
Rugged Man, Havoc, Mobb we infamous

[Verse 2: Havoc]
Got my drink on, reminiscing drama on God
Stepped out my crib, politic with the gods
Over gats, even though the hood is hot
Jakes on bikes, gotta hold down the block
Cause my life this automatic instant, ice grills, without a blink
Permanently stained, they surface like Big
They shitting on my name, some ask why
Cause the sign just a regular gangsta, fuck DKNY
Scuffed Timbs laid up in Holiday Inn's
And shortie wanna fret, I'm running up in her friend
Official roaches, Scarface, shitting on mister Sosa, stay bent
Hold my liquor, like a cup coaster, handle mines
Sever great lines, cut throats while you drop dimes
Snitch niggas on my shit list, quietly cock the biscuit
The Rugged Man, Havoc, Mobb we infamous

[Hook x3]
