[Verse 1: D.J. Cli-n-tel]
Seven days a week, he's on call
To get the party people up off the wall
You'll feel motivated as he operates
'Cause party energy is what he generates
He'll prescribe for you his potent elixir
Two turntables, speakers, and a mixer
He'll rock your party wherever you be
Calling Dr. Dre to surgery

[Scratching]

[Verse 2: Arabian Prince]
L.A. is the place for you to be
To witness Dr. Dre in surgery
He has a Ph. D in mixology
To cut on the wheels so viciously
Boom-boom, boom-boom
B-b-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Come here freak, closer and see
Dr. Dre operate in Surgery

[Bridge: Computer Voice]
Now that control is back you see
It's time for the remix of surgery
So get domestic before this time, don't be late
To witness Dr. Dre as he operates
Check it out!

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
I'm Dr. Dre gorgeous hunk of a man
Doing tricks on the mix that no others can
The nurses say I'm cute, they say I'm fine
So you better beware because I'll blow your mind
I'll take you to my car, I'll take you to my home
Then up and down your body, my finger will roam
The nurses say that I'm nasty, they say that I'm mean
But when they come to my pad, they're guaranteed to scream
Ahh!
