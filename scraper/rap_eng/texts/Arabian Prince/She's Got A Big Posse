[Skit: Announcer + Arabian Prince]
Good morning
Fellow Big Posse anonymous members
Today I'd like to introduce to you-
Brother Arab

Good morning fellow Big Posse members
I'm Brother Arab
"How ya' doing, Brother Arab?"
I'm here today to tell you that I haven't had a Big Posse, in 90 days
*Clapping*
And I'm also here to tell you, my story

[Intro]
You do understand she wanted a Big Posse
Saggin'
I ain't standin' in no line, man
Hey, wait, wait, wait
You can't go in there with those pants on

[Verse 1]
[? 0:50] on a Saturday night in L.A., yo
Feelin' kinda funky, lookin' for some play, yo
But I couldn't find a good freak anyway
So I [? 0:58] like intensive care
That's when I glanced at the dance floor
She glanced back and I knew it was a chance
For Brother Arab to get busy
I stepped on the [? 1:07], feelin' kinda dizzy
I said yo T' what's the scoop on the beauty
Her face is cute and she's got a big booty
T' said yo, I wouldn't mess with baby [? 1:15]
The list of the possy reeks like roll call
I tried to get her face in focus
I took another sip and blam, hocus-pocus
I made up my mind, yeah it's her I gotta meet
The posse's deep and I'm still gonna creep
T' said If you're gonna step you ain't gotta say please
She's jammin' out like a [? 1:31] machine
I paused for a minute, took another sip
I think she winked at me, she's on my tip
I decided to step, and get with the program
[? 1:39] slowjam
T' leaned over and said the way I see
You better be packin' homeboy, she's got a big posse

[Hook]
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone

[Verse 2]
I stepped with the [? 2:05] , cuz' it was showtime
[? 2:07] gotta spit those lines
I took my place in her face-y
I asked her name, she said her name was Tracy
I said Tracy, yo
Your body's kickin' strong
Let's dance some more and play a different song
[? 2:18] but somethin' freaky, my god
[? 2:21] more like we could spend a night
My mouth dropped open and the licker start talkin'
The hell with fools that grab your girl and start walkin'
Move, but [? 2:29] too slow
Red walked up boy, yo man yo!
Think for a minute before you get with that
I hope you got [? 2:34]
I looked over my shoulder and said
"What you say?"
It's just that my boys said shes 'sposed to get busy
I tried to ignore it, stepped to the bar
Baby said "Everybody knows who you are"
I said funny, I had the same idea
Just speak a little louder, make yourself clear
I said nevermind baby, just disregard
I grabbed her by the arm and I headed for the car
And as we walked I heard a brother whisper behind me
"Be ready homeboy, she's got a big posse"

[Hook]
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone

Then we were in the parkin' lot, jettin' from the place
By now it was wide so I was hidin' my face
A bitch rolled up in her car, horn soundin'
She said "don't worry, that's some fellas that I'm down with"
I said oh no, how bad could this get
Then I saw my boy and I started to sweat
He said "Yo why you [? 3:33] oh I see"
To hook with that big posse freak named Tracy
I asked my man if he had the scoop
He said "Yo Arab if you want the truth"
At the Jimmy hotel or the Jimmy inn
Brothers check in and are never seen again
I said hold up, how could this be?
*Record scratch*
"How many [? 3:49] was in the posse?"
He said "Well, if you really must know
There's Will and Phil and my homeboy Joe
[? 3:55] and my partner Fred, that guy, and [? 3:58]
[? 4:00] and this dude named Shine
And the list goes on and on and on"
I said nevermind, I get the drift
This ain't the freak I need to mess with
But after all of that, I just had to see
*Record scratch*
Nigga that bitch had a big posse

[Hook (Interpolated with outro)]
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone
You ought to leave it alone

[Outro]
So there you have it members, that's my story
Never mess with a big posse
Or you're gonna end up like me
*Snoring*
