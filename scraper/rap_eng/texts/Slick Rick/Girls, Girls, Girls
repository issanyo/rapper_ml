[Intro: JAY-Z]
Je t'adore, JAY-Z, je t'adore
Course I love you... I love all y'all
Hehehe, hehehe, for real

[Chorus: Biz Markie + JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me "cabron" plus "maricon"
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, "Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo"
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like: "Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me"
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
"Ma cherie amour, tu es belle"
Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: "all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough"
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crepe
An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate
I love

[Chorus: Q-Tip + JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, uh-huh
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

[Chorus: Slick Rick + JAY-Z]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, "Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?"
I'm like, "Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half"
I got this ho that after 12 million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov'
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe

[Outro: JAY-Z + (Biz, Tip, Rick)]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that Coupe, sittin on deuce-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls..
