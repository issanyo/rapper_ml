Intro: Slick Rick

Great, I'm in trouble, I suppose, because I does hit
Girlfriend, ya love me in my drop-top Rolls
Traffic came to a holt
I'm like "I beg your pardon, madam, it was truly my fault"
And instead of me yellin and add to no above
Hon, all in my drop dead gorgious love
Pretty? Body definitely curnin, and thirdly
The way she dyed her hair bronze fitted her superbly

Verse 1: Montell Jordan

Baby, let me say what's on my mind
Take a little time to express myself, honey, I think you're fly
Now I don't have no problem sayin what I like
I'd like to spend some time with you startin with tonight a-na-la

Chorus:

I like the way you walk
The sexy way you talk
Ooh I can't help myself
Baby, I like
I like to kiss your lips
And when you move your hips
Ooh I can't help myself
Baby, I like

Verse 2: MJ

Here's the situation, I lay it on the line
Meaningless relationships they're wastin all my time
You are the special someone that I wanna get to know
Baby can't you see it in my eyes I wanna take you home

Bridge: MJ

Tonight let's take our time
Do it nice, do it slow
Baby, we got nowhere to go
Oh I hope you don't mind
Oh, I'm comin on real strong
I give good lovin all night long
Oh, I like it

Chorus (x2)
