Eminem's Lose Yourself sample playing

[Verse 1]
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don’t care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Got somebody here, might get some now
If you’re not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight, alright

[Pre-Chorus]
So "la da di da di"
We like to party
Dancing with molly
And doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

[Chorus]
And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night?
Can’t you see it we who 'bout that life?

And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
We run things, things don’t run we
Don’t take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
To my homegirls here with the big butts
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember, only Dad can judge us
Forget the haters cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom
We all so turnt up here
Getting turnt up, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So "la da da di", we like to party
Dancing with molly
And doing whatever we want
This is our house
These are our rules

[Chorus]
And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night?
Can’t you see it we who 'bout that life?

And we can’t stop
And we won’t stop
We run things, things don’t run we
Don’t take nothing from nobody

[Bridge]
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand, oh oh oh
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand, oh oh oh
Don't break his heart, his achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'll understand

[Chorus]
And she can't stop
And she won't stop
Can't you see it's she who owns the night?
Can't you see it's she who's 'bout that life?

And she can't stop
And she won't stop
She runs things, things don't run she
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah
