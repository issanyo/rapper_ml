It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around

It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around

I'm a live nigga, standin' out like a rash
A live nigga, keep cash in a stash
What's the eggs without the corn beef hash?
Blowin' up like Sarah Dash
Jerkin' up the neck, known to cause whiplash
Dance and get down with me
Peep the steelo, the strategy
What killed the cat's curiosity?
You better believe that I be freakin'

Pull my ass if the M4 leakin'
Same MC who wreck shop at the beacon
Uptown lingo is what I'm speakin'
So put your pedal to the metal
And feet to the ground and peep this uptown sound
Makes no sense just standin' around
Hey, it makes no sense just standin' around

It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
Come on everybody lets all get down

Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
It makes no sense just standin' around

I'm chillin' with nice and smooth with my phat farm outfit
They say what's up Rick what's up good to see you out kid
Where the party at, askin' and relaxin'
And pop a couple of Moe's listenin' to some fat tracks with them
Being a kid was locked, want to check the the scene and shit
Zulu nation havin' somethin' tonight at the Arena Greg
Lets get drunk and roll, said they like the sound of it
Rolled a couple of blunts, but ruler wasn't down with it

Fans did some plead to go and hit somethin'
Be off work release even if you get caught with weed in yo system
Be up north quick, since we all down to roll
Went to the club havin' the up most amount of fun
Should've heard them groupies scream for
Wonder why this brother lookin' at me all mean for
Ignored it, kept wappin' till my neck hurt
Then Greg Nice and smooth did this very same record called

It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
Come on everybody lets all get down

Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down

Happy birthday, what's the word say
To papa smurf, I cover the globe like earth day
Rollin' with G and the Rickster
Flavor full boogie down mixture
We came back to attack with the ruler
You can't get no cooler on our way to the bank
Now do the Patty Duke and then do the Spank

Come from the heart things spark
And keep your eyes glued to the top of the chart
Oh shit, it's the man with the fronts and the jewels
The kids with the blunts and the tools
Sewing up shop like needles
Sellin' more record than The Beetles
So don't be astound
And makes no sense in standin' around

It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
It makes no sense just standin' around
Come on everybody lets all get down

Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
It makes no sense just standin' around

Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
It makes no sense just standin' around

Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets
Come on everybody lets, all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
Come on everybody lets all get down
It makes no sense just standin' around
