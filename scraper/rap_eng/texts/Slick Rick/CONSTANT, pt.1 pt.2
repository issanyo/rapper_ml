Pt. 1
[Intro: will.i.am]
On and on, on and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on, yo

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hand on the watch
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5 'til the new year drop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
We keep it constant, constant
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant (Ya don't, ya don't)

[Verse 1: ​apl.de.ap]
We be throwing down like Muhammad
Niggas don't be knowing we be flyin' like comets
Slick with the tongue, word out to mouth vomit
Master of the Sun, we rocking these comics
Better beware, spiritual warfare
Spread the love, northern and southern hemisphere
Black Eyed Peas took it out of the stratosphere
We made it to the top livin' on a prayer
Nation to nation, good vibration
Underground sound hit the whole population
Check the demonstration coming from the Peas
Moving high velocity, no time to freeze
(Music, please)

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hand on the watch
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
It goes on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5 'til the new year drop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
To the, tick-tock, ya don't stop
We keep it constant, constant
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant (Ya don't, ya don't)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
My job is to take it to the next
I maneuver through the simple minds and keep it complex
Spritually, mentally, we will connect
We do it intentionally for progress
First is the heart, gotta spread the love effect
Second is the mind, gotta feed 'em intellect
Third is the body, gotta treat it with respect
'Cause you don't wanna be a ghost, be the spirit? Yes
One love, one tribe, staying colorblind
Inspired by Apl 'cause he's really colorblind
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
We keep it on the positive 'cause it is hard to find
We keep it

[Bridge 1: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
Constant, constant (Ya don't, ya don't stop)
Constant (Ya don't stop), constant
We go on and on and on, all around the clock
2-4-7 like the hands on a watch
We go on and on and on, all around the clock
3-6-5, watch the new year drop

Pt. 2
[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
We keep it constant, constant
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant
Constant, constant (Ya don't stop)

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Bring the tracks out, bring the brass out
I go Coltrane with my sax out
Let's go Soul Train, let's go black out
Turn that bass up, let's go max out
Bring the drums out, bring the beats out
Bring that mic out so we can speak out
When it's lights out, we go freak out
I got freestyles to take MC's out
Mic check one-two, I bring the heat out
I'm givin' you somin' new, somin' to tweet about
Don't be upset when B-E-P out
Ain't no quartet, they just three out
There's the trio, one amigo
Filipino, and a negro
Around the globe that's just how we go
Ain't no stopping, ain't no ego

[Bridge 2: Jessica Reynoso﻿]
Boy, you got a girl, got me on fire
On and on and on and on and on
Boy you got a girl, takin' me higher
Going, going, going, going, gone
Boy, you got a girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl
Boy you got a girl feeling inspired
And I don't wanna stop it if it's wrong

[Chorus: will.i.am & Slick Rick]
(Ya don't stop)
Constant, constant, constant
We keep it constant (Ya don't), constant (Stop, stop)
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant (Ya don't stop)
Constant, constant
We keep it constant, constant (Ya don't)
Constant (Ya don't, ya don't stop)
