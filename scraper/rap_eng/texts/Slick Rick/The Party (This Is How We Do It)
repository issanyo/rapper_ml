This is how we do it
It's Friday night and I feel alright
The party is here on the west side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, I'ma take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore cause I'm faded
Honeys in the streets, say Monty yeah we made it

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, party's underway
So, it feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, so let me hear the party say!
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, party's underway
So, it feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, so let me hear the party say!

It feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good...
It feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good...
It feels so good in my hood tonight
It feels so good in my hood tonight

If you were from where I'm from, then you would know
That I gotta get mine, in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up ya cup, and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, party's underway
So, it feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, so let me hear the party say!
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, party's underway
So, it feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, so let me hear the party say!

It feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good
Let me hear the party
It feels so good...
Let, let... me hear the party
It feels so good, it feels so good, it feels so good
Let me hear the party
It feels so good...
Let, let, let.. me hear the party

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, party's underway
So, it feels so good in my hood tonight
The party's underway, so let me hear the party say!
