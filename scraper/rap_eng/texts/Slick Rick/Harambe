Lights Green and Gold
A Rasta at the control
They try to keep us down
Scatter us all around
To diverse parts of the earth
Hoping we'd waste away
But no matter what they do
But no matter what they say
All a Jah Jah children a go Harambe

Harambe Harambe Rastaman say harambe
Harambe Harambe The Higher One say Haramb

What colour is the rainbow
Check it the next time it shows
That's the way we should be
All together in harmony
We sailing in the same boat
We rocking up the same stream
So no matter what they do
So no matter what they say
All a Jah Jah children a go Harambe

Harambe Harambe Rastaman say Harambe
Harambe Harambe The Higher One say Haramb

Can a leopard change its spots
Or Jah Jah children their skin
Bob say blood is thicker than water
Love will take us further
So don't feel no way
Cause a so Jah Jah say
And no matter what they do
And no matter what they say
All a Jah Jah children a go harambe

Harambe Harambe Rastaman say Harambe
Harambe Harambe The Higher One say Harambe

The Natural way Harambe
The African way Harambe
Don't feel no way Harambe
A so Jah Jah say Harambe
Member Gong say Harambe
