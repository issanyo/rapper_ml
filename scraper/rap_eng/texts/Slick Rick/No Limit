I got no limit
This expression is impressive I'm getting it how I live it
It's best to bet that they will never stand next to this, I am winning
I do this shit to brag not for attention, don't forget that
I got no limit
Could've been a child of god but found that I am bound to fall victim to this sinning
For this money I'm in prison
But the bars is what they lay behind and I forgot to mention that I
Never needed practice only passion
Dreams like Cassius a vision you can't imagine
Hands made of stone, competition bout to catch 'em
They a statue, I'm clay, this chip on my shoulder isn't in frame
But what about the caption?
They've got a picture of the moment, a moment within the action
I don't care about reactions
A picture speaks a thousand words, I'm just tryna grasp 'em
They can take the moment for granted, they open handed, they don't Deserve to be so understanding of all this magic
Obsessed with the kid, they got a fatal attraction
But keeping focused on the lane only gets you stuck in the traffic
Nick Orton, I've been dodging all the masters
Ricky pouring in that lane with the fastest whip
I'm back on my radioactive shit
They've been active on the radio but they ain't this immaculate
Imagine if you lived the life we actually live
I'm on about a wink of sleep within the year and it's the twenty sixth of march
Working for no pay, no cars, no status yet it's easy to see that I am all that and a bag of chips
I bet if you showed the best they'd get mad at it and throw a tantrum on they throne
Cause i'll make your favourite rapper play within the average role
I'm coming after the goal
Fuck it, I'm mad, I'm coming after they throat
Alexander McQueen
You can swing above the floor for ever claiming that my rap isn't inspiration
What Im sayin? McQueen was the goat
But you don't like what I wrote
Then take a lap with him
Lightning strike in a flash and its actually just my heart within a lapse again
It's pounding out my chest, I ran a lap on this, I'm after this
Bar that they claim is higher than a mountain ridge to push it out the atmosphere and fly around the solar system blasphemous
