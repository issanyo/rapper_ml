Mighty Bay could you read us a bed time story please!
Yeah, alright you kids tuck in bed I'll grab the storybook
You tucked in right
Yes!
For the kids

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time not long ago It was a little boy with a tangled Afro
He was friends with anybody that was cool gladly introduce himself not being rude
He was just a little boy being mislead by another little boy and this is what he said
Ay, me and you man we tight as white on rice shook his hand and got hit with a hard right
Fell off the bike he asked his friend why he said you ain't my homie nigga you knew that lie
Him and his homeboys got on bikes and left he tried to catch up but he ran out of breath
Around that time he only had three friends but at the end
They was a pretend
He didn't know what else to do he call 911 they picked him up and said fuck you
Oh no he had no hope got on social media couldn't laugh at a joke
Then he called his friends three weeks later
After that incident he ask for no favors
This a true story so don't you dear laugh just a boy riding down the wrong street path
Eventually he still had many glories
But this is how i'ma end this story
GOODNIGHT!

{Outro: Mighty Bay & Pitch Voice}
WOW I can't believe that happen hope it doesn't happen to me
For the kids, know your surroundings

Knock em' out (Repeatedly)
