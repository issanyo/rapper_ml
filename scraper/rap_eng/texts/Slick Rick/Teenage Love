[Hook]
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse 1]
Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go through
It deals with your feelings, so hear what I say
It's like a day where nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says there's no one else and she claims there is no other
The feelings are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts and deeply hid emotions

[Hook]
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse 2]
Precious times, hoping they won't end
Tell your mother 'bout your lover, also your best friend
Ya mighty proud while you're holding her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This person brings a certain warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelings were the same, now here's the score
You love him too much, and they don't love you anymore
Or did you have to choose a number or because you're not being true?
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seeing you?
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take hints quick, and make the right change

[Hook]
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse 3]
See just when you swore, the ball was rollin' and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, with a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go with this dead relationship
Hanging around, and buying him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawking
When conversation comes, you do all the talking
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're saying, yeah he's all on my (tits)
They're getting sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happening, and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught
It'll spread around town faster than ya thought
And break up time, and you receive the words
Yo, this is from the heart, and I know the part hurts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go
"Don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again"

[Bridge]
"Do you know where ya goin' to
Do like the things that life is showin' you
And are you going to
Do you know?"
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

[Hook]
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
