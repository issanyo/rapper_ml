To all the stupid people and the rest
You are about to witness something you've never witnessed before this
But ladies and gentlemen Kenny Muhammad and his lucky two members of Little Jimmy
(Impossible to hear this part)
In the place to be we're gonna show you how to do it for the year 2005
Kicking it, and are you sick all the mothers like in their world
Because we need to continue to rock stop his modem cold to minimize the scene
Cutting out all the lyrical coherence because we know how to up-upload it
This is a Paul mix man we all wish underworld set this no good moment
And ya'll know us that's when we run into something like this

La-di-da-di da-di-da-di we likes to party-party
We always causing trouble-trouble bothering everybody
We are just just some men up on the mic
When-when we grab the pitch, YO WE GRAB THAT SHIT TIGHT
Fuck all-a-y'all who's going to Hell
Just keep on smiling and enjoy yourself
Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy-conditionin'
That's what we create, because that be our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because (WHAT) this type of shit happens every day (WHAT)
This type of shit happens EVERY DAY (WHAT)
THIS TYPE OF SHIT HAPPENS EVERY DAY

I woke up AROUND two in the MORNIN'
Did a lot of COKE, strechin', YAWNIN'
Went into the BATHROOM to wash UP
Put the soap on my face and my hand on my crotch
Said, mirra-mirra on-on the wall, who be that top-choice of-of them all?
There was a rubble-rubble-dubble
Five minutes it lasted. The mirror said...

"You are you conceited bastard!"
Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef
And so I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Change my clothes, spark my hair
I busted out the brand new Gucci underwear
And for all the little girls that I might take home, we have
The Johnson's baby powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million dollas
I wore the high tops and pop the flat colla
Stepped out the crib, stopped short, oh no
Ahhh, nawww shit, God damn
SHIT I FORGOT MY FUCKING KANGOL

Den me dilly dally, me run into an alley
Got me busted into me old girl Shaniqua from the valley
God damn bitch played hard to get
So I said, "What's up girl, you look like shit
Don't cry, dry your eye"
Shaniqua tells her momma, "You all better hide tonight"
Because her mom stepped up from behind
Hit her in the FACE, stabbed her in the EYE
Punched her in the BELLY, stepped on her FEET
Slammed the girl on the hard concrete
Oohhhh BITCH was STRONG, momma's GONE
Something seemed WRONG, now what is going on
I tried to bust it up, I said, "Stop it, leave her"
She said, "If I can't have you, she can't eitherrrrrrrrr"

She grabbed me hard, around my cock
I broke out like I had the chicken pox
Momma gave chase, she caught us quickly
She put her fucking finger in the face of Little Jimmy
And said "Why don't you give me some play
Stop avoiding me like you is gay
I wet my pants whenever you say"
("Oohhh bitches love me cause they know that I can") rock, rock
"Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
I love your faggy ways
I guess that's why you're always getting laid"
Oohh on and on and on and on and... (WORD) whatever (SHAKA-ZULU)

I said, (PLAYED OUT) I'm gonna give her a kiss
I said, "You can't have me, I'm too young for you, miss"
She said, "No you are not," then she starts crying
I said, "I'm 18" and she says "stop lying"
"Seriously, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, you can't be my loverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
POW
