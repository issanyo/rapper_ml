[Verse 1]
Many are called but the chosen are few
The best of the few is you
You know exactly what to do
Baby, your time is so perfect
Why in the hell I deserve it?
Keep on doin' what you do

[Chorus]
No one else (No)
No one else (No, no)
Can do me like you do me
No one else
No, no one else
Can do me like you do me

[Verse 2]
Happy 1 plus happy 1 is 2
Happy 2 are me and you
Our love was meant to be
Yes, we have our up's and down's
But somehow we came around
And we made each other love so free

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't lie
'Cause I'm satisfied
Yes, I'm satisfied
Even when I cry (Even when I cry)
Won't stray
Stray away from you (I won't stray)
I would be a fool (No, baby)
You know these words are true

[Chorus]
No one else (No one)
No one else (Nobody)
Can do me like you do me
(Can do me like you do me)
No one else
No, no one else
Can do me like you do me

(Slick Rick: "There is no competition") (Repeated 6X)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't lie
'Cause I'm satisfied (Satisfied)
Yes, I'm satisfied (Oh, ooh)
Even when I cry (Even when I cry)
Won't stray
Stray away from you (I won't stray)
I would be a fool (No way)
You know these words are true (So true)

[Chorus]
No one else (No one)
No one else (No one)
Can do me like you do me
(Can do me like you do me)
No one else
No, no one else (Ooh)
Can do me like you do me (Oh oh)

No one else
No one else
Can do me like you do me (No)
No one else
No, no one else
Can do me like you do me (No one can do me...)

No one else (No one)
No one else (I said there's nobody...)
Can do me like you do me
(...that can do me the way you do me, yeah)
No one else
No, no one else
Can do me like you do me
("There is no competition")

No one else ("There is no competition")
No one else ("There is no competition")
Can do me like you do me
("There is no competition")
No one else ("There is no competition")
No, no one else ("There is no competition")
Can do me like you do me
