[Slick Rick]
Word... girl I come to your rescue in any kind of weather
So let's take the union, me and you together
Because my heart and soul is not all I got to give
I need someone to share my fortune with
My life is empty I need more than money
So tell me how to win your heart, I love you honey
The truth, girl, says your chance, honey, take it
And I might just let you see The Al B naked

[Chorus: Al B. Sure!]
If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend
Tell me, baby, just tell me what I am (Tell me!)
If I'm not your lover, if I'm not your friend (Tell me!)
Tell me, baby

[Al B. Sure!]
I'm just a man, who comes around at night
And to leave you, girl, baby, that ain't right (tell me!)
You call me over, and give me sexy talk
After things are over, you tell me take a walk, girl
If you think, I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one, who's loving you the most, girl
Material things, don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

[Chorus]

[Al B. Sure!]
Since this conversation, I'm so confused
Tell me, baby, am I being used
Dedication is what I want, you're being complicated
You know it's just a front, girl
If you think, I'm playing you too close
I just want to be the one, who's loving you the most, girl
Material things, don't come into my world
All I want is a one man girl

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
Let's walk down the aisle, tell me are you ready dear?
Please be my snuggles, I can be your teddy bear
It's your character I like, you got a brain in your head
Wake up together and it's breakfast in bed
Our love is everlasting for you not to mention
The feelings are true when they need a little attention
For real girl, so here's your chance honey take it
And I might just let you see The Al B naked

[Chorus]

[Slick Rick]
On the real tip, I think I see the heaven above in you
I wish I could say you're struggling love me too
Cause you tell me to chill, is it B.S. you feed me?
Jealous cause I know that you really don't need me
Old school would say, "here we go! here we go!"
To help me if I fall, don't never let me go
For real ladies, so here's your chance, honey, take it
And I might just let you see The Al B naked

[Chorus]
