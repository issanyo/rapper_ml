(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

[Verse 1]
Well it's me (​Rick D)​, and it's time to mingle
So wake up world and bus' out my new single
I take dead bodies and I boost them up live
So straighten up and be alert because the ruler's arrived
No (​​not uncle Sam)​​ but I can still recruit
As (hip-hop commander)​​ of the people's troop
So troop be troopers and follow commands
Cause (​​no one can rule like the ruler Rick can)​​
Though some like it hot and some may like the shock
So let's get together what I mean is rock
No vanity, insanity (strictly cloud)​​
Now put your hands together and scream and shout
(Go Slick Rick!)​​ and then go berserk
But (keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt)
And don't be boring please not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy

(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

[Verse 2]
The original, that's the title I've earned
Anybody disagreeing been burnt' and learnt'
Told a theif straighten up as I humble hell
And I (​​bring a little rhythm)​​ wherever I dwell
Cuz' the door's wide open and I'm taking the chance
As I dip through Europe and I'm going to (France)
Now I always may try and play like full of fun
But in this type of rap I number one
Not number (​​two)​​ on a wild-style blizzard
And if I was in the OZ I'd be (Slick Rick the wizzard)​​
Or some young man named MC Ricky D
And no fool can say they created me
So wild child, let's go bizerk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't freeload cuz' I'm not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy

(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

​​​(Scratches)​​​​​​​ Oh my God!
Excuse me, Doug E. Fresh (​​Yes)

(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

[Verse 3]
Well we're in the last station of the final chapter
(Oh Ricky don't go)​​ But you know that I have to
So tell me daily news and all the magazines
(Ricky D's in control)​​ Of what? {​​​​​​​Hip-hop scene}​​​​​​​
Uptown downtown the man's rated supreme
If Martin Luther were here he'd say (​​Hey Rick I had a dream)​​
And if I'm at a jam it must be pumping
People dwell us light cuz' it's them I'm stomping
So y'all be adventurous (​​Shake and twist)
I insist that this will bring more than just bliss
A posse's and crews' (Is the size you best)​​
It's time to get (Stupid)​​, what I mean is (​​Fresh)​​
Hey wild child let's go berserk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't be a crumb and try to phase me
My jam's stacked so let's get crazy

(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!
