[Verse 1]
I'm so God damn sick of not living up to expectations
My stomach's in a knot
I think about the distance I've come an awful lot
And I don't really have too much to say about my spot
I'm caught up in the chase after everything I want
With no progress, I'm out of reach and out of touch with reality
I think they mad at me
My, focus is salary
Their, focus anatomy
They worried about the calories I eat
They worried about gravity, I leap
I've been jumping off the balcony
This a different side to me
I've changed for the better
I plan to take reign but the weather is brisk
I feel sick!
They telling me I'll never forget what I did
But I don't really plan to
My success isn't circumstantial
I'm moving for the plate
But this weight has been heavy like an anvil
I've been at a stand still

[Hook]
I don't even know if I'm okay...

[Verse 2]
It's been two years since I left
And honestly I meant no disrespect
But I obviously haven't even learned who I am
And yet take a look at what everybody expects
I'm sick! But pretend I'm in perfect health
That's the problem I guess
I focused on the wrong things
My art is a way to help me
But this isn't really healthy...
I'm just tryna vent
Cold air through my window
I've been running from my past since the intro
I'm just looking for some justice, wins low
And the losses getting loud, crescendo
I don't, even, hear the, crowd
I have been drowned in my mental
And they don't even listen in the first place
So I guess I'll just fade away
Invisible, worst case
(Fuck)
