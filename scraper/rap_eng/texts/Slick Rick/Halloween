You can open your eyes and see I've devoted
All this time to it
Pans labyrinth, my hands looking to fine tune this
What slumbers here is not human
I brought an atom bomb with me call me Von Neumann
I'm not a scientist, just innovative
I'm tryna climb just with the things I say displayed on the grave stone of these rappers favourites
Pick your poison you can sleep in peace and get out of the way, or lie awake assured that you could die in vein
You should select your placement
And register that thought
In fact there's a line in a verse for every person that's been talking trash
You not in my class, same study but you have not advanced, hopeless
I hope you grabbed your moment cause it's closing
Fast, they hoping slowly, but he no Aleister Crowley
Crash, comes the moonchild
I've spoken
Light faces the darkness
The devil versus my soul
He can keep it if wishes, he just has to cut my marriage to these quotes he can't control me
Holy matrimony

You can open your mind and see I've devoted

Only Every single word and sentence
They've been working, efforts show that
They could never burn my essence or deter what I work towards with records
A perfect record of 100 wins, so when he losing?
Never
They life a fairytale what happens after ever
Ever after cash to burn through the rainy weather, I'm eating better
They tryna come for beef, how dare he try to spill my cheddar?
They've been thinking cow but I'm the goat
We on a different level
I'm on an open road, applying pressure to the pedal
While They in the house on the couch, they working, no Geppetto
I've been focused on my goals, while they focused on the measure
I am never scared to crash, I got this shit in the bag, man I was cut for the clash, A different cloth is apparent within my craft
Kendrick verse on control, I am that
The embodiment of telling your competition they trash
I feel like Michael Myers, this knife might take your life in a flash and I know violence sounds obscene
But in October we don't trick or treat
This isn't Halloween
