My defences
Become fences
Now I'm stumbling
I change my face up

And if you think I'm fake up
Wait around till
Till I take off my make-up
Here we go again

I need another one
Her name is
She looks through me
Says I'm the only one

I met a
A Christian in Christiansands
And a devil in Helsinki
I met a
Christian in Christiansands
And a devil in Helsinki

Is it getting better?
Wrote her a letter
Asking questions
Baby steps in sections

I mean we'll take it slow
I really don't know
When you talk
You make me cringe

Silver me to the messenger
Let her go, don't question her

I met a
A Christian in Christiansands
And a devil in Helsinki
I met a
Christian in Christiansands
And a devil in Helsinki

You and me
What does that mean?
Always
What does that mean?
Forever
What does that mean?

It means we'll manage
I'll master your language
And in the meantime
I'll create my own
By my own
