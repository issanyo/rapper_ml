[Intro: LL Cool J]
Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house
("For alla y'all")

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and
Stick around while I defend my crown and
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs
And isn't motivated by green
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and
Makin' love like a medicine doctor
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her

[Chorus: Dawn Greene]
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin'
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to
The conversation, sexy vibration
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion
Times is hard, I need a woman that rolls with God
And the only man she loves is Todd
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'
Or could it be you never loved me at all and
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement
The reproducer factor and
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and
Standin' by her man till the end
Not only as a lover but a friend

[Chorus: Dawn Greene]
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Man, do things get better?
We can look back at the whole aerators
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and
You held back when your love jones called in
You had faith when they said they're not callin'
You understood that what we had was good
You stood by your man like a real queen should
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and
As long as I live on this earth
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth

[Chorus: Dawn Greene]
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby, (word)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man (peace)
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
