Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, real niggas that are billboard charters
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Skills provide the shows, also fright the foes
And when I step into a room, pimps hide they hoes
Is that really him? yes, that's his highness
And for the last time stop lookin at his fine ass
(Y'know!) homosexuals, smirk, converse and say
That nigga box is workin girlfriend
You wanna talk about a fat phrase carrier
To billionaire white chick jump the race barrier?
You know a nice girl, but I didn't want a bit of her
Sayin, I like your slang what's with the wife, get rid of her
Son, sony talkin japanese
With mice like, whattup rick? you can have my cheese kid
I am such a heavy hitter
Even chandalier jealous off the patch ice glitter (bling!)
Rappers walkin round, strappin fearsome, here son
And remember your rap career's done
Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, real niggas that are billboard charters
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, we'll seperate the men from the heartless
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, a tag team from the top all-starters
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Runnin spots, pants leg tucked in my socks
Puff and lay a spread, order drinks, henn on the rocks
Wintertime sport a fox, maybe a sable
Three-quarter length mink sound right for this occasion
Heard me john blazin, see me in gangster flicks
Life is so amazin, hate to be paperless
Bill gate in this, it must be god, I'm not an atheist
Wanted like kingpins by atf
Your girl want my name on her chest
Me and rick argue about whose chain is the best
Gucci boxers, my diet changed from sushi to pastas
Wear my hat like the late sinatra's
Models pop the coochie when the spot us
Finally rappers you could be proud of, from the bronx
To queensbridge houses what? if you feel me then holla
Thug niggas, who bail be worth a million dollars, what
Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, real niggas that are billboard charters
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, we'll seperate the men from the heartless
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, a tag team from the top all-starters
Me and nas bring it to your hardest
Trackmasters def jam
Baby what the deal
Slick rick, big nas yo
