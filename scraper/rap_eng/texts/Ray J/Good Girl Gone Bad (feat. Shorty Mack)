(Chorus):
When a good good girl's gone bad
When a good good girl's gone bad she (gone forever) (2x)

(Verse 1):
You should be there girl
When I was in love, with you
Listen girl, I said
If I'm not here for love
What am I here for
Tell me baby, got me going crazy yeah, I'm like

Oooo, what am I supposed to do, when my heart is soul is so into you
Oooo, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew starts changing

(Chorus)

(Verse 2):
Oohh if I'm not here for love
What am I here for?, you, oh baby, I said
If you didn't think it was love
What did you think it was?
Tell me baby, got me goin crazy, I'm like

Oooo, what am I supposed to do, when I've givin all my lovin to you
Oooo, what am I supposed to do, when the girl that I once knew starts changing (yeah)

(Chorus)
(Shorty Mack)
Mommy nah, not at all
Papi's never forgiven yuh
I can only honestly say "I'm gettin rid of yuh"
I pity yuh
Did it to only yuhself
So when yuh cryin, understand that yuh noosed ya self

When a girls gone bad, she's gone foreva
Betta say bye J, I'm undastandin that nigga
So all the Prada that I bought, you can keep that gold
But when I get to the pad, have your shit out the door
I'm Shorty Mack

(Chorus) fade out
