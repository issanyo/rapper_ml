In so many ways, that I can't remember my name
You got the ride, that I wanna drive
You got the groove that soothes with all good thangs

Ain't nothin better than, when I hold you close
Ain't nothin better than, the way you turn me on and on
Cause baby baby, you know you make it right
Each and every time I look in your eyes, I...

Honey darlin, you got me goin crazy
Cause everywhere I look, it's you that I see
I'm on a high, way up in the sky
Above the clouds where all the birds do fly

B-Section:

Ain't nothin better than, the way you turn me on (on)
Cause baby baby, you make it oh so right
And I don't want it to come as no surprise... I)
