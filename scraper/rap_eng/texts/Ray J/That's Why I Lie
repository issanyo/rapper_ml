[Chorus:]
If I told you why, why, why
I'd probably lie, lie, lie
Can't stand to see you cry, cry, cry
All I know is I'll be hurting you if I told you the truth
That's why I lie, lie, lie
You'd got me thinking my, my, my
And it's killing me inside oh
I don't want you saying bye, bye, bye

[Verse 1:]
Don't understand can't explain what it is
That's causing me to, feel the need to explore any more, I have you
But when I do there's no truth baby all I do is lie
The only truth is that lie
Cause I need you in my life

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I don't always want you to know where I'm going to oh oh
So I sneak out the best way I can for a rendezvous whoaaa, I've lied enough to know who I can, and can not fool
So I cross my heart, swear it's true
That I'm loving you whoa
I'm doing what I gotta do to keep you
There's one thing I swear it's true
I don't know what I'd do if I was eva to lose you
Please baby believe me
And tell me that you'd neva eva leave me
I just don't want to you hear you say good bye

[Chorus 2x]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh
Whoaaaoh, oh, oh, oh hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, ohhhh

[Chorus 3x]
