Can't run, can't hide (you can't run)
You know you can't get away
I often wonder who you know
What you thinkin, where'd you go, baby
Your mother done told you more than twice in your life
You can't keep runnin' away, you can't keep hidin from yo man, it's all right
You got me thinkin, thinkin

You should be thinkin, thinkin
Loosin' you'd be a shame
So baby baby come around

Can't run, can't hide
You know you can't get away (can't hide)
Can't eat, can't sleep

Till ya know you got your lovin today
You can't hide what your feelin
When you're dealin, with my love (with my love)
I often wonder, what you say
Or when I'm not around, but I'm hear to stay, baby
I've paid the time, i've paid my dues
And now its bout time that we had some rules (baby)
Stop hiding from me, ignoring

(The situation at hand)

Let's stop pretending, you hear me

(Let a man be a man)

So baby baby, come around (oh)
Cause we can work it out before the sun goes down (whoa yeah)
Can't run, can't hide (can't get away)
