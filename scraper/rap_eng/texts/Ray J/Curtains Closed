(Verse 1)
Our love's been tested lately
We're always in the public eye
And when we finally get alone,  wooh yeah
I'm reminded why my heart is still belongs to you girl
And i don't ever, baby don't make me live without you
Your my only centerpiece, the palace that i really need. wooo yeah
(Hook)
All I,  need is you
You make me feel like all I, need is you
And when the curtains close, and the lights go down and the phantom pull off
I'm saying when the show is over, the camera stop recording i can't wait til its just me and you
You got me saying  oh-oh, oho, oho, oho, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oho, oho, oho, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oho, oho, oho, oh-oh (x2)

You got me saying oh-oh, oho, oho, oho, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oho, oho, oho, oh-oh
