A girl

[Verse:]
From the first day that I met ya knew that you was independent always pushin up in yo own whip
Always payin for all yo own shit (girl)
'cause you know that it's all about (you got it goin on)
Ever since we been together our whole life's been so much better
And for that I wanna thank ya
Lord knows I appreciate you girl
Baby you are the truth girl you so beautiful the way I feel each time we kiss if you only knew
Lets build a cottage with the white picket fences (maybe)
We'll have some children (after) well settle down the two of us

[Bridge:]

If there's anything you ever need please don't hesitate

[Chorus:]
Come with me girl lets play house

This ain't no short term
I'll still remain loyal to you even when your backs turned
Girl I am here to stay
Just like that dark stain on your white carpet
I won't go away! (forever and a day)
I'm so excited and the temperatures risin
No need don't try to fight it
We should just realize that we're in love
