[Intro: Ray J]
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right

[Verse 1: Ray J]
Baby, you could be the first
I'm a be the first to ease your temper
We ain't plan four years
Girl, we could've had kids when you was chuckin' my timber
Girl, tell me what you want
Her friends don't get along, so we classify members
Ooh, nipples hard, girl
I ain't got to start, but we cover like winter
We done get it too much, we never did wrong
All night long, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Ray J]
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Brown sugar, babe
I gets high off your love and don't know how to behave
I pour wine in the tub and we could drown in the grapes
Ooh, I'm all over your anus, yeah I'm crowdin' your space
I'm a junkie for your love, girl, your body like base
I got some cocaine on the mirror, you could powder your face
I told her, 'Take her panties off', she say, 'What are those?'
'Bout to play up in that sugar like the Sugar Bowl
Ooh, and you must be used to me spendin'
And all of that sweet wining and dinin'
But I'm fuckin' you tonight, open up, I scuba dive
You're the wifey, you're the bride
I fucked the hoes that threw the rice
I was Tunechi, you was nice, you was sugar, I was spice
Me and you sweet and sour, perfect match, Bonnie, Clyde
Sexy drop of caramel, honey, all of this sugar ain't good for me

[Hook: Ray J]
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right

[Verse 3: Ray J]
Ain't no wave, baby, we can drown
We done give too much, we never get away, baby
You come 'round and I ain't gon' put it in you
You get brown sugar, talk about everything you want
I'm a give it to you, baby, what you want do?
I'm a live for you, baby, it's true
Little Hennessy, a little coke, a little weed
Girl, I ain't gon' judge you
All I ever, ever want to do is fuck you and love you, I know it

[Hook: Ray J]
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
Brown sugar, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I lick you like brown sugar, make me right
