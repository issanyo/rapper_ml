(feat. Brandy)

[Verse 1 - Ray J]
My brothers and sisters
Here some courage and some wisdom
As you go on life's mission
Hope you make the right decisions
Although life's just an illusion
People get lokced up
Some start using
While the government is recrutin
They trainin more soldiers to go out and do it

[Chorus:]
But when the war is over
You won't have to worry no more
When the war is over
You won't have to cry on my shoulder

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Brandy]
When we need it
It's time for freedom
No more voices
We can beat em'
Stand together fight the struggle
Take our justice to another level
Your mistakes please don't repeat em'
All your goals you can achieve them
When they tell you no don't believe them
All your enemies you can defeat em'

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge - Ray J & Brandy]
[Ray J]
We just gotta walk away
And pray that it will be okay
Know there will be brighter day's
See when you little kids get older
Think of what your elders told ya
Remember all the fallen soldiers
When the war is over
[Brandy]
Everything is meant to be
It will all go down in history
Just be proud of your family
When the war is over
Well we're gonna make it through
Forget about the things we do
I just want peace with you
When the war is over

[Chorus 2x]
[Breakdown]
One day one day one day
I hope to see my brother
One day one day one day
I hope to see my homie 2Pac
One day one day one day
I hope to see my nigga Biggie
One day one day one day
I hope to see my girl Aaliyah
One day one day one day
I hope to see my girl Left Eye
One day one day one day
I hope to see Big Pun and Jam Master Jay
