See we got this little thing that we do (do)
I just keep it between me and you (and you)
You call me when you with it
Then I'm a come get it
Yeah we'll be creepin'
But it's all a secret (yeah)

So I'll keep it playa
No I ain't trippin'
Know you got a man
I'm a play my position
See I ain't worried
It's no competition

Man, listen we can keep it on the low
Ain't no body gotta know

Baby you sayin' you cryin'
'bout wha' ya man do
You say he been lyin'
Well what you gon' do
Ain't no use if you leavin'
Every niggah you meet
And it's chic
And just sneak off with me on the weekend
Don't get back and even
When you see him leavin'
That's when you need to be creepin'
While he on the road
Thinkin' you home sleepin'
Slap by the boss house so I can dig deep in
I mean you prayin' for attention
And I can give you plenty
Your secret's safe with me
Baby let's go begin it
But thug love him back
It's ain't a competition
I ain't tryna' be your man
I'm just givin' you what you missin' (yeah)
And don't feel bad
He put you up in this position
If ya'll was in love
Why ain't no hugin' and kissin'
When you wanna get away
I'll take you for a ride
When that niggah act up
I'll be by your side

See we got this little thing that we do
I'll just keep it between me and you
You call me when you with it
So I'm a come get it
Yeah we'll be creepin'
But it's all a secret (yeah)

See I ain't worried
It's no competition

Man, we can keep it on the low
Ain't no body got to know
