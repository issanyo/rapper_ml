[Verse 1:]
Yeah you know what this is
You granted all my wishes
And damn it I'm gon miss it if we fade away
I don't wanna be down
Lovin' you I have found
Girl I want you around
Always...

Don't you believe that
Nobody needs you 'cause I do
I need all of you baby
If you can see that
Nobody needs you like I do
I need all of you baby

[Chorus:]
Anytime I'm needin someone
I think of you for comfort, can you feel me?
Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can you feel me?

[Verse 2:]
Oh, ain't no need for frontin babygirl I believe
And everything you doin shorty know this
You play a real big part in
Keepin' me on my feet
And I love you so much I won't blow this

Don't you believe that
Nobody needs you 'cause I do

If you can see that
Nobody needs you like I do I need all of you baby

[Chorus:]
Anytime I'm needin someone
I think of you for comfort, can you feel me?
Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can you feel me?

[Verse 3:]
Ain't no way I'll ever be thru with you
Baby let me know if we can make it
'Cause I wanna be there, baby can I be there?
Anywhere I don't care

[Chorus x3:]
Anytime I'm needin someone
I think of you for comfort, can you feel me?
Anytime ur feelin down or
Need a friend for comfort, can you feel me?

Girl, whenever I'm down I think of you to lift me up
And if you ever need a friend
If you ever need someone to talk to
I'm right here...
I'll never leave
I love you
