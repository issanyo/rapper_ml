I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I rather live
A lonely life

Everyday I wake up
I still think about the past
I would wake-up in the morning
With the same clothes on my back
I would take the money
That I made
And give it to my dad
I was present on the block
But I was absent in the class
Oooooh
So hard for a young brother
I hardly saw my self
And barely
Every saw my mother
I got in trouble every-day
Because I loved the drama
Didn't understand how
My first name had changed
To brandy's brother
I grew up 'insight' of you
Everybody know I was a fool
Red laces in my tennis shoes
I blow money
On my dead homies funerals
The critics say
I'm out acting a fool
I'm tired of being excused
I'm putting out these sex tapes
I'm just living my life
Just because I'm making money
And my chain so bright
I make the night time day
Cause my wrist so light

I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I don't wanna be right
I rather live
A lonely life
