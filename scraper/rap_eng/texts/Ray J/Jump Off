I know we ain't talked in a while give me a minute
I've got somethin on my chest to get off I need u to listen lord
It got me trippin lord
I'm even sippin lord
Can't get it off my mind
Can't even sleep at night
I tried to talk to mama all my friends and my pastor
No one gave any good advice so I'm gettin at ya
Because I'm so confused I don't know what to do
Like comparin a Bentley to a Honda can't compare the two

[Bridge:]
I don't know how it got like this
But I know that it's serious
Choosin who to be with
Leaving me sleepless
Oh can u help me
Better yet tell me girl

[Chorus:]
One girl is my jump off
One girl is my wife
I done fell in love with both and I can't decide
So tell me what to do
Cause I don't know which one to choose
I just don't know

I was scared I was fallin too deep off with my pimpin
If I kept on playin russian roulette with all of these women like
I guess I broke a rule cause I ain't play it cool
But that ain't no excuse cause that's just what I do
Or either that u were tryna teach me a lesson
To appreciate what I got or recognize the blessin
And so I see it now
And plus I'm bleedin now for u to show me a sign and help me figure out

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
I'm in the worst situation
I mean I love my wife
But I'm in love with my jump off, too

[Chorus]
