Say shawty got gifts,gifts,gifts
Damn girl...
Shawty got gifts,gifts

{chorus}
Shawty got lips,shawty got hips
In the club shawty makes them niggas wanna give tips
She climbs up to the top
And down to a split
Shawty know how to make a body do tricks

You looking real fly
You looking real cute
In your birthday suit

In the club shawty makes them niggas wanna give tips
She climbs up to the top
And down to a split
Shawty know how to make a body do tricks

{2 verse}
Shawty got gift,gifts,gifts
You know how to lick those
Lips,lips
You have to have a move in those
Hips,hips
Shake your body down and then you

In the club shawty makes them niggas wanna give tips
She climbs up to the top
And down to a split
Shawty know how to make a body do tricks

Off in the club

Show her some love

You ride your body like a
Whip,whip

Ships,ships
Neither want relationships

In the club shawty makes them niggas wanna give tips
She climbs up to the top
And down to a split
Shawty know how to make a body do tricks

Thats the way of life
Don't be mad if you ain't camping
