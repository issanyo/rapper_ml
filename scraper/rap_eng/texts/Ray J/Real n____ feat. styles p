Real Nigga (Feat. Styles P)
I'm a (real nigga) 6x
Dope dealer

1 verse:
Probably catch me up in the club with some bad b**
I remember nights when I didn't have b**
I remember days when I didn't have riches
While i'm in a club now champagne spillin
I'm in a club now
I'm a big spender
Ice on my neck
And diamonds on my suspenders
I'm no beginner
My ex girl she keep callin me trippin
But I keep tryin tell her that I'm stay pimpin
A baller ?? bentley
Black lamborghini
Three or four houses
15 hammies
I'm a boss ??
You wanna roll with the dollars ??

(chorus)2x
