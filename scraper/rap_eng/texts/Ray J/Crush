Oh baby don't you crush
We just gotta take our time
Hush, girl just hush
Don't say a word i know what you like
Its just us x2
Turning off my phone tonight cuz im crushing you, crushing you tonight
Every now and then i feel a little and vip get a little crowded
She see the peace with the diamonds aside her
So vibrant platinum all around it
