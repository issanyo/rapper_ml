[Verse 1: Ray J]
I cashed out on your crib
Payed all your debts now your credit is the shit
Now you got a 750 on your FICO
Flying out to Paris hanging by the Eiffel
I ain't tripping 'bout your ex man he trifling
If he want to trip I hit him with the riffel
I'm buying you a whip with your name on the title
And everything red up under your high heels
Haters want to know how I feel, man a nigga feel good
And if I only had one wish, man I wish a nigga would
Big body parked outside, and I got a whole lot of niggas outside
Thirty five deep every time when we ride
But baby you the one and you right by my side

Ooh x7

[Verse 2: Ray J]
I guess I'm just stuck in my ways
Cause I play hoes like niggas play spades
Riding in that ghost like Nicholas Cage
And buying all these whips you would think I have slaves
Six bedrooms two maids
Three car garage and a guard with a gate
I got a bottom bitch she stay into [?]
But when it comes to my number one baby you the ace
Haters want to know how I feel, man a nigga feel good
And if I only had one wish, man I wish a nigga would
I keep a lot of codeine in my cup
And I put a lot of good weed in the blunt

[Hook: Ray J]
A real life playa I ain't got to front
When I say I got a wife, baby you the one
Baby you the one, b-baby you the one
Baby you the one, one, baby you the one
A real life playa I ain't got to front
When I say I got a wife, baby you the one
I want you right by my side, right by my side
R-right by my side, right by my side
Real life playa I ain't got to front
When I say I got a wife, baby you the one

[Verse 3: Payso B]
Real life playa, tell it from the jump
Go to sleep with a bitch and wake up with a blunt
If you son't nothing bitch you know a nigga stunting
Ain't an asthmatic but I got to keep a pump
Got to keep a bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
The top gone do that mean that I ain't flashing
Young nigga, pocket look fatter
Anything you want baby you can have it
Niggas want to know how I feel, I said a nigga feel great
And if I only had one meal, [?] I take a nigga plate
I take a nigga bitch, since she act like she don't want to
Baby I could be a go to
Long as you do what you're supposed to
Long as you do what you're supposed to
