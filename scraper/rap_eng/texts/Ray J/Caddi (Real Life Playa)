[Verse 1: Ray J]
I cashed out on yo crib
Paid all your debts, now your credit is the shit
Now you got a 750 on your viker
Flyin' out to Paris, hangin' by the Eiffel
I ain't trippin' 'bout your ex man, he trifle
But if he wanna trip, I hit him with the rifle
I'm buyin' you a whip with your name on title
Everythin' red up until your high heels

[Hook: Ray J]
Haters wanna know how I feel
Man, a nigga feel good
And if I only had one wish
Man, I wish a nigga would
Big body parked outside
And I got a whole lot of niggas outside
35 deep, every time when we ride
But baby, you the one and you right by my side

[Verse 2: Ray J]
I guess I'm just stuck in my ways
Cause I play hoes like niggas play spades
Ridin' in that Ghost like nigga, let's gauge
Buyin' all these whips, you would think I had slaves
6 bedrooms, 2 maids
3 car garage and a guard with the gate
I got a bottom bitch, she stay in Talucca May
When it comes to my number one, baby, you the Ace

[Hook: Ray J]
Haters wanna know how I feel
Man, a nigga feel good
And if I only had one wish
Man, I wish a nigga would
A lot of codeine in the cut
And I put a lot of good weed in the blunt
A real life player, I ain't gotta front
When I say that I got a wife, baby, you the one
Baby, you the one, baby, you the one
Baby, you the one, baby, you the one
A real life player, I ain't gotta front
When I say that I got a wife, baby, you the one
When you right by my side, right by my side
When you right by my side, right by my side
A real life player, I ain't gotta front
When I say that I got a wife, baby, you the one

[Verse 3: Payso B]
I say real life player, tell her from the jump
Go asleep to a bitch and wake up to a blunt
If you don't know my name, you know a nigga stunt
I that S body, but I gotta keep it pumped
Gotta, gotta keep a bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
The top goin' through that meanin', now you're flashin'
Young nigga, pockets on savage
Anythin' you want, baby you can have it

[Hook: Payso B]
Nigga wanna know how I feel
I said a nigga feel great
And if I only had one mill
Best believe I take a nigga plate
I take a nigga bitch to see LA
I want you, baby I could pay the dope too
Long as you do what you supposed to
Long as you do what you supposed to
