Sexy can I
Yeah, yeahhh
All we wanna know is...

(Chorus:)
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners?
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then we're back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I

(Yung Berg:)
What up lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dippin, Louis Vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a nigga go by
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since

(Ray J:)
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, keep it on the low
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo
(Oh, ohh, ohh) Now look shawty, look shawty
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh, ohh, ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but shawty all I want to know is:)
Sexy can I

Sexy can I, visit you at work
When you sliding down the pole
No panties, no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole
Then you drop and do the splits
How you make that pussy talk
Baby damn, you is the shit
(Oh, ohh, ohh) Now look shawty, look shawty
I make it rain in the club like (Oh, ohh, ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is:)
Sexy can I

Sexy can I, just pardon my manners?
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I

(Yung Berg:)
I ain't concerned with who ya boy's hittin, or who Ray's melon
When I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin'
See I'm a go getta and she a go getta
You already know, yeah
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I send for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
Let it air dry
And if you ain't fuckin' tonight
Then you can watch that tour bus go by

(Chorus:)
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners?
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (oh baby)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then we're back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a nigga like (ohhhh)
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
