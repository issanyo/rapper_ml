Ayyo girl, this is the world mean of thug r&b
It's rise high, let's go

Lately baby I been thinkin something crazy
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
If you wonderin why bills are high
Which only seems to multiply
(e can get out of tha ghetto)
And what we can do and we wanna do
Is somethin we need completely falls through...damn
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
Times been strange, time for time to change
We just sick of things bein the same
(We can get out of tha ghetto)

1-	Gonna struggle, work hard and hustle
Gonna stay focus, trust me
I trust you, or will say goodbye
Farewell, to ourtrouble
And basically
We gon get out of tha ghetto

Last night I vale to you
To change my life and change yours too
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
And all the distance looks hard to go
Until we try he will not know
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
And though pain and sufferin has covered your eye
I wanna show you a brighter side
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
We'llbe successful, we'll be free
We can do it, just you wait and see
(We can get out of tha ghetto)
So come on girl

Repeat 1

I was inspired, to show you a better day girl
So pack up your things, we're on our way

[Shorty Mack]
We can get up and get out
The crib already fit out
I'm like what you wanna do baby
It's all jeezy, smashin with the knock out
Lady life will be easy
Believe me, cause ain't no stuntin around here
It's not a game, you mess up here
It'll be a shame, for you honey
While I'm offerin to you money
And a ticket out of the hood
Is that understood?
I get you right of tha ghetto
And that's on the hood

Repeat 1
