(All 5 models swallow, uh... knockot... uh... yeah... sexy... uh yeah)

I see some ladies on the track (they sexy)
I put them ladies on they back (don't test me)
I double up (up) right before they sex me
And when I lick the ladies, it gets messy

I like to trick trick trick

We hit the club v.I.p. (5 bottles, 5 models)
