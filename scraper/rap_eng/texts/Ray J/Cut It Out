[Verse 1 - Ray J]
What you gonna do when your tongue's out?
How you supposed to see when your light's out?
Tell me whose name you gon' call out
I know you wanna take my love away
We were looking forward to brighter days
And I didn't even know you felt this way
I didn't even know you felt this way
This way

[Pre-Hook - Ray J]
I've been working hard
Monday through Sunday
Trynna do the best I can for you
Times is getting hard
And all you want's money
Trynna do the best I can for you

[Verse 2 - Jay Sean]
What you gonna do if I'm not around?
Who you gonna call when it's late out?
Who you gonna hold when you're lay down?
Don't push my love away
Together we can look to brighter days
So don't tell me you feel this way
I don't wanna hear you feel this way
