Neptunes, tell me, Ray J, where you at, come on


[Bridge: Ray J]
(I been) Workin' all day (and now it's on)
Pull up and don't pay (When the line is long)
Girls in the club (you wanna f...)
Ice grillin' these thugs (Ya'll wanna thump?)
Is it 'cause my shine (major ice)
I'm talkin' about blind ya (Like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (Without my team)
Cali, sticky green (Know what I mean)

[Verse 1: Ray J]
It's on and poppin', the DJ's rockin'
Chickens is watchin', it's on tonight
You had a long day yo, but champagne by the caseload
Pockets full of pesos, it's on tonight

[Hook: Pharrell + (Ray J)]
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)
Yo, you know the words (wait a minute)

[Bridge: Ray J]
(I been) Workin' all day (and now it's on)

Girls in the club (you wanna f...)
Ice grillin' these thugs (Ya'll wanna thump?)

I'm talkin' about blind ya (Like Vegas lights)
Never on the scene (Without my team)
Cali, sticky green (Know what I mean)

[Verse 2: Ray J]
So much you go through
Only problems know you
Let's party like we supposed to
It's on tonight
There's not a righter way
You've had a tired day
Let's party the night away
It's on tonight

{Hook: Ray J]
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 3: Ray J]
I twist the I-buddha
In the black jag cougar
You ain't feel nothin'
Until the ripper ray do ya
I know this I.D. kinda look fake to ya
But you know I'm constantly club rockin' and mink coppin'
Believe that, my team stay packed like greenbacks
And when that dro blows my Lex seats lean back
And on short notice, I pull out the old lotuses
And show up at party icin' like big polar bears

From the land of women, sunny days, chrome spinnin'
Juice and ginnin', it's on tonight
If you feel you're number one, representin' where you're from
Sex, you're gettin' some, it's on tonight

[Hook: Pharrell + (Ray J)]
Oh Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
(Wait a minute)
