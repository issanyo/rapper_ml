[Chorus: Jacquees & Chris Brown]
I said I'm sorry if I hurt you, baby (I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
'Cause I been, I been fuckin' hoes (ooh)
And I know you don't care about shit right now
Fuck that, I can't let it go
Oh yeah
I know I've been fuckin' hoes, fuck them hoes
You know I, you know I, fuck them hoes, girl, I own it
Every time I'm out of line, fuck them hoes
I know I been a dog but you now that you here tonight
Fuck them hoes

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, I been doin' way too much, I'm ruthless (yeah, yeah)
I been playin' stupid, way too much excuses (stupid, oh yeah)
I know I let you down, pussy made me lose it (down, ow)
You know my mind get stupid whenever she shake her booty (ha)
Tried to make her by makin' her payments
Nigga keepin' a lid on the latest
In the doghouse, 'bout to buy a plane for her
'Cause, she don't fuck with the Mercedes
Money, I'm in cut with the paper
And she in the cut with the razor
Baby, just do me a favor
Live for now and talk 'bout it later

[Chorus: Jacquees & Chris Brown]
I said I'm sorry if I hurt you, baby (I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
'Cause I been, I been fuckin' hoes (ooh)
And I know you don't care about shit right now
Fuck that, I can't let it go
Oh yeah
I know I've been fuckin' hoes, fuck them hoes
You know I, you know I, fuck them hoes, girl, I own it
Every time I'm out of line, fuck them hoes
I know I been a dog but you now that you here tonight
Fuck them hoes

[Verse 2: Ray J]
You know I been whippin', whippin', young, rich and ruthless
And I been playin' stupid, way too much excuses
I know I let you down, when I saw you do it
You put your heart into it and then I broke into it
Damn, girl, I'm sorry
All these drugs I'm doin'
All this weed I'm smokin'
All these bitches choosin'
I'm the one in the club with the paper
All of these models I paid for
2:30 in the club, gettin' fucked up
Let's talk about that shit later

[Chorus: Jacquees & Ray J & Chris Brown]
I said I'm sorry if I hurt you, baby (talk about it later, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
'Cause I been, I been fuckin' hoes (ooh)
And I know you don't care about shit right now
Fuck that, I can't let it go
Oh yeah
I know I've been fuckin' hoes, fuck them hoes
You know I, you know I, fuck them hoes, girl, I own it
Every time I'm out of line, fuck them hoes
I know I been a dog but you now that you here tonight, fuck them hoes
