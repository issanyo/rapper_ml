I know we on this shit again
But we done come too far to stop or give up
And I know you think it's better to just leave
And this is where we disagree

But I know I'm shooting with my words
Except they're the only words
You know my actions are louder then what you heard
I'm tired of this arguing and I wish for one last thing
It means the world to me

Cause I know what we got
Even when you don't
We rock, baby, 'til the wheels fall off, feel me
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing

Last call, last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip
Baby, just one last wish

Been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, baby, just one last wish
Last wish

Girl, I'm sick and tired of dj vu
Cause here we are again at the top of our lungs
'Til we both know we love harder then we
Give each other chance to see

And every time I see tears, it hurts
Tell me, is it really worth
You crying, me lying, it's absurd
A better man is what I'ma be
So I wish for one last thing
And that's you and me

Cause I know what we got
Even when you don't
We rock, baby, 'til the wheels fall off, feel me
It's real love and I still believe if I wish on one last thing

Last call, last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip
Baby, just one last wish

Said, we done been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, baby, just one last wish
Last wish

Oh, damn, if I could just wish for one last thing
Oh, baby, we've been here before
Got outta control, then we let it fall
It's time that we pick it up and never have to sacrifice

This is my last wish
This a new setup, we can do it better
Me and you against the world take over together
Yeah, that's how real love should be

So, baby, one last call, one last kiss
Baby, just one last wish
Last wrong, last slip, baby
Just one last wish

We been through it all
Fought through the pain
And our love's even stronger, girl, we can do it again
And so that's all and that's it, yeah
Baby, just one last wish, yeah
