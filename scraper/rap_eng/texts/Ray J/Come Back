[Verse 1: Ray J]
Girl, you should stay in tonight (oh, woah)
We don't gotta go out
'Cause I got something planned special, for you
But baby, you could keep your heels on and that lingerie
I'm loving your panties, in my bed, keep it romantic (mm, oh)
And girl, I know the sheets is all white
We can fuck 'em up, girl, it's all right

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ray J]
Let's disappear, yeah, yeah
If you don't mind leaving your girlfriends, no?
We don't need nobody watching us, yeah
'Cause baby, that's when we making love
I want for you to scream, when you're about to climax (ooh)
When I'm kissing you, holding you and fucking you on the floor (ooh)
And when I'm inside, I'm gonna give it to you once more (when I'm inside)
So you gon' come back

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Oh, babe, your body, your body, your body (damn)
Oh, give it all to me, I don't wanna share
Making you scream, when I'm pullin' your hair
Neighbors bangin' on the walls
And baby, we're louder than the music
We goin' faster and faster
It can't get no better, lovin' is right here
So let's go

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ray J]
Let's disappear, yeah, yeah
If you don't mind leaving your girlfriends, no?
We don't need nobody watching us, yeah
'Cause that's when, 'cause baby, that's when we making love (making love)
I want for you to scream, when you're about to climax (when you climax, ooh)
When I'm kissing you, holding you and fucking you on the floor (we doin' it on the floor)
And when I'm inside, I'm gonna give it to you once more
So you gon' come back

[Verse 3: Ray J]
All in your dreams, you gon' see my face at night (ooh)
My tongue, goes in the perfect place, right (ooh)
Girl, I want it, but, I know you want it more
Let's run away and watch you come back for more
Oh, let's get started with a little foreplay
Can we fuck up the bed? On them white sheets, yeah
Ooh, I know you gon' be comin' back
Gave you the best, now you runnin' it back
You know, I just wanna love you tonight

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ray J]
Let's disappear, yeah, yeah
If you don't mind leaving your girlfriends, no? (you don't mind)
We'll be alright until the sunrise
'Cause baby, 'cause that's when, that's when we making love
I want for you to scream, when you're about to climax  (ooh, I want for you to scream, ooh, ooh)
When I'm kissing you, holding you, fucking you on the floor (on the floor)
And when I'm inside
If I give it to you once more, you gon' come back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Let's disappear, yeah, yeah
If you don't mind leaving your girlfriends, no?
'Cause baby, that's when we makin' love
I want for you to scream, when you're about to climax
When I'm kissing you, holding you, fucking you on the floor
And when I'm inside
If I give it to you once more, you gon' come back
