[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You ain’t nothing but trouble, yeah, yeah
Girl, that's why you my side bitch
Give your ass to all them niggas
I just wanna fuck, no love
Say you love me, bitch, you lying
Give your ass to all them niggas
She’s sexy, I want that
I know she been leadin' me on
He gave her a bottle of Rosé
Watch that bitch turn off her phone
She sneaky, can’t believe
Anything that comes out her lips
Girl, that's why you my side bitch
That's why you my side bitch

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, I’m takin' shots of D'USSÉ
Te-tellin’ me you love me, better watch what you say
Bi-bitch, you a bird, I got a flock of groupies
Lo-lo-lookin' for the money, bitch, I ball, I’m too paid
What you, what you mean I ain't never committin'?
Every nigga in LA to hit it
I ain't, I ain't throwin’ no shade, lil' mama got amazin' titties
Big booty but her brain is missin'
Let me paint the picture
Says she, says she couldn’t see me tonight, had to go to work
Had to get her weight up
4-45 minutes later, seen the bitch in the club with another nigga laid up (laid up)
With her triflin' ass, I guess this hoe all about her paper
I’m-I'm-I'ma do me, I-I-I told her don’t do me no favors, favors
Thinkin’ ‘bout wildin’ out, then the DJ startin' shoutin’ me out
Yeah, I’m finna send my niggas to the bitch crib
While she fuckin' my niggas, runnin' the house
Huh, I need to cool down, nigga
Call myself Brown, you that nigga
Get up off that mob shit
A nigga really can't be mad about a side bitch, ha

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You ain’t nothing but trouble, yeah, yeah
Girl, that's why you my side bitch
Give your ass to all them niggas
I just wanna fuck, no love
Say you love me, bitch, you lying
Give your ass to all them niggas
She’s sexy, I want that
I know she been leadin' me on
He gave her a bottle of Rosé
Watch that bitch turn off her phone
She sneaky, can’t believe
Anything that comes out her lips
Girl, that's why you my side bitch
That's why you my side bitch

[Verse 2: Ray J]
I-I-I got a lot of freaky reasons
Why-why I call you my side chick, I-I-I call you my side chick (side chick)
I-I fuck you every other season (si-si-side chick, oh yeah)
Ba-baby, you too much trouble for a nigga to be in (si-si-side chick)
Why does that pussy feel so good? (So fucking good)
A fucked up position for a nigga to be in
She got so much motivation, my side bitch
Pu-pu-pussy good and hella tight
A fucked up position for a nigga to be in
Girl, we be fuckin’ this bitch 'til she hate it
Bo-bottom bitches kinda crazy
Too much trouble for a nigga to be in
Si-si-side bitch tryna have my babies

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Ray J)]
You ain’t nothing but trouble, yeah, yeah (ooh, woah)
Girl, that's why you my side bitch (th-th-that's why you my side bitch)
Give your ass to all them niggas (all my niggas)
I just wanna fuck, no love (fuck, no love)
Say you love me, bitch, you lying
Give your ass to all them niggas (oh, wanna let the homies get it)
She’s sexy, I want that
I know she been leadin' me on (and I know she been leadin' me on)
He gave her a bottle of Rosé (of Rosé)
Watch that bitch turn off her phone
She sneaky, can’t believe
Anything that comes out her lips (can't believe anything that this bitch talking 'bout)
Girl, that's why you my side bitch (that's why)
That's why you my side bitch (that's why you my side bitch)

[Outro: Ray J]
Yeah, ooh, that's why
That's why, that's why
