I love the way your body lookin' under these lights
The way you move it got me wantin' you tonight
So tell the DJ play my song
'Cause I love it, I love it when it's our song
Tell the DJ play my song
Because you're leaving with me when it's done
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
Ooh, girl
There's nobody else up in here I wanna see, no
So let me know whenever you ready to leave, to leave
Let me show you what I can do
There's nobody but me and you and her
So keep on dancing 'til the song's done
'Cause you'll be leaving with me when it's done
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
Baby, you're so utterly cute and
Takin' you home under one small condition
Way ya wind up your body, ya listen
Every girl a-tryin' to be with the freshness
Never seen you talk that much
Turn a girl like a coconut
You're not just a [Incomprehensible]
What?
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me on
And I love it, and I love it
Baby, you're turnin' me
On tonight, on tonight, on
On, o-o-on, on, o-o-on
On, o-o-on, on, o-o-on
