Is it my turn to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world
Or even imagine your emotions to tell myself anything?
Is it my turn to hold you by your hands
Tell you I love you, and you not hear me?
Is it my turn to totally understand
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing?

(Chorus:)
If I have to give away
The feeling that I feel
If I have to sacrifice
Whatever, baby, whatever, baby
If I have to take apart
All that I am
Is there anything that I would not do?
'Cause inside, I'd die without you

Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done
But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things just completely turn around?
So take ev'ry little piece of my heart
So take ev'ry little piece of my soul
So take ev'ry little piece of my mind
'Cause if you're gone
Inside, I'd die without you

(Repeat chorus)
I'd die without you
I'd die without you...
