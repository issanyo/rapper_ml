Took away my soul, start
Changing all my clothes
I can feel it
Found out all my calls
Tried to take control
Of my feelings

(Listen)
I guess is time now
Time to say goodbye now
Makes me wanna cry but
Gotta make it out right now
All tha things that we've been through
Just couldn't figure it out
I thought we told the truth
But guess it was all a lie now
I change my number
Take down all of our pictures

I'm always in the club now
Drinking a lot of liquor
I had to put my
Engagement ring on a dresser
Thought I found my girl
Guess I still never met her

Took away my soul, start
Changing all my clothes
I can feel it
Something wasn't going right)
Found out all my calls
Tried to take control
Of my feelings
