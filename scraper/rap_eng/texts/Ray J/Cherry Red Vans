[Chorus: Ray J, Chris Brown & Luvaboy TJ]
Just a young, fly nigga with a plan
Make 100 million in my cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans, cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
My niggas shoot and then it's all on sight
A wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke
I got that coke pure white, in them baby blue Xans
'Bout to make a million in my cherry red Vans, cherry red Vans

[Verse 1: Ray J]
This one for my niggas in the slam, cherry red
Pontiac, 5 bird, Trans-Am
My auntie got the collard greens cookin' in the pan
And it feel like Thanksgiving when we feastin' with the fam
I buy my bottom bitch a burgundy Porsche Cayenne
Paid my taxes to the church and said, "Fuck Uncle Sam"
I keep a mill in the oven like some honey baked ham
I went from black tuxedo with some cherry red Vans

[Chorus: Ray J, Chris Brown & Luvaboy TJ]
Just a young, fly nigga with a plan
Make 100 million in my cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans, cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
My niggas shoot and then it's all on sight
A wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke
I got that coke pure white, in them baby blue Xans
'Bout to make a million in my cherry red Vans, cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans
Cherry red
Cherry red Vans

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
All of you niggas some fake hoes
I dare any nigga to try some
Niggas upset, but won't take a hit
It's eastside nigga, 500
Piru, single that nigga from Avenue
Ray J, I fuck with the centre views
Give you one problem, we make the news
Soo-woo to my down boos
Pistol hang where my nuts at
Rain of fire, that's a blood bath
You already know where my cup at
Actavis, you can't touch that
If you got a problem, then pull up, yeah
We gon' handle this shit now
Only reason you hang with the shooters
Cause you not the man in the house

[Chorus: Ray J, Chris Brown & Luvaboy TJ]
Just a young, fly nigga with a plan
Make 100 million in my cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans, cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
My niggas shoot and then it's all on sight
A wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke
I got that coke pure white, in them baby blue Xans
'Bout to make a million in my cherry red Vans, cherry red Vans

[Verse 3: Luvaboy TJ]
Lace up my red Vans, duckin' the feds
Helicopters on my head
Movin' the work on my momma house
Had to get the cheese, bitch a mighty mouse
Pull up in that cherry red django
Breakin' the bread down with all of my niggas
Yeah, this is how we hang
Earned my stripes in the street like I banged up
That thug life, that's that hood life
Live your flag and throw your set up
Hustle for that good life
Chitty chitty bang bang
Ain't nothin' but a whoop thing
No stoppin' that shoot train
Bomb on 'em like Hussain

[Chorus: Ray J, Chris Brown & Luvaboy TJ]
Just a young, fly nigga with a plan
Make 100 million in my cherry red Vans
Cherry red Vans, cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
My niggas shoot and then it's all on sight
A wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke
I got that coke pure white, in them baby blue Xans
'Bout to make a million in my cherry red Vans, cherry red Vans
