So high...
So high..
Girl let me say that
I like everything that you do
Can't hide from the feeling
That I get when I get next to you
Girl for me the only thing on my mind
Is to know that you're for real
And when I imagine your pretty smile
It only confirms what I feel
And I am

(Chorus)
High on you
So high on you
And I can only hope that you feel it too
I'm high on you
So high on you
Tell me you feel it too
Now this might sound crazy
But I dream about you all the time (all the time)
Cuz you are my baby
Cuz u are my my baby
And to me you're a perfect sunshine, yeah
Girl I cherish the moments alone with you
And the loveliness of your embrace
And when I imagine your pretty smile
It only takes my breath away

(Chorus)

Bridge:
So high on you baby
So high on you girl
Let me show you baby
And I'll give you the world
I'm high on you so high on you
Tell me you feel it too
