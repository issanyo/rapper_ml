Yeah, Melody
I just wish that I could hold you
While you're slipping through my fingers, as I'm playing the piano
What is that sound it sounds so beautiful
And I just wanna be close to you
Close enough that I can feel you
I'm already wondering where you are
And it sounds like it's coming from my guitar

[Hook]
Melody, said that I love you
Melody, said that I adore you
Melody, said that I need you
You can call me foolish and I might be but I'm in love with a melody

Donnie and Stevie they can write you
Now you come humming in my write too
As the music's playing in my radio
I hear that sound it sounds so beautiful
It makes me wanna just embrace you
Your close enough that I can taste you
I know just where you are caus your right here next to me
