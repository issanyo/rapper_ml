Damn, she crazy, and she done a whole lot too
She gone tap my phone, she stole my credit card
She turned my cable off
I swear she's driving me insane
She cut up all my clothes
Threw my shoes in the pool
She smashed up my new car
She is straight up acting like a fool

Chorus:
I tried to kick her out
I tried to set her free
But she just won't let me go
I done change all my locks
I threw away her keys
But she just won't leave me alone
She kicked my niggas out
Said they been spending too much time with me
She rearranged my house
And threw my numbers in the trash
She found out all my codes
Said were hoes been calling me
Went and killed my dog in me
She's in my crib, but I'm the one who's got to leave
I tried to kick her out
I tried to set her free
But she just won't let me go
I done change all my locks
I threw away her keys
But she just won't leave me alone
Shoulda listened to my father
When he said that she wasn't the one for me
Shoulda listened to my mother
When she said that she wasn't no good for me
Shoulda listened to my sister
When I know she wasn't feeling her
She put this spell on me and just won't let me leave
I tried to kick her out
I tried to set her free
But she just won't let me go
I done change all my locks
I threw away her keys
But she just won't leave me alone
I tried to kick her out
I tried to set her free
But she just won't let me go
I done change all my locks
I threw away her keys
But she just won't leave me alone
