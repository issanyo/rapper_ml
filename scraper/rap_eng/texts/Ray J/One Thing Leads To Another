Hey DJ, let's get it started
Now everybody scream

You gon' learn lil' mama and I got to teach you
Pitbull, yeah, nice to meet you
Baby, we can blah, blah, blah, blow canvo chit-chat
Knowing damn well lady you gon' let me hit that
Iyiyiy lo que te bien mami te que bien ta nina calientica
Ya tu saves no mami wey its an honest aid
What a true lad
Skip the linkens and give me the frinkens
Make paper and shorten them bankers
Ti-ti-ti-time for some time for some action
Smashing movie action
Mr. Mr. 30-30-305 the new
To that crew yeah that's right
We gon' do what we do when we do what we do
Now baby lets go back to my room
Girl, I understand if you say no
'Cause once we started who knows where we'll go
On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop
But your hot I'mma make you dance
On the floor to the pole, baby, either way it goes
On the pole I'mma make you dance
On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop
But you're hot I'mma make you dance
In the middle of the night
We be turning of the lights
Then 1 thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
Don't look back once we blast off, let's go
'Cause once we get there we're so out of control
On the floor to the spot we ain't even gotta stop
But you're hot, I'mma make you dance
In the middle of the night
We be turning of the lights
Then one thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
Baby come follow my lead
I'm takin' off everything
And since I see you undress
Dress me I'll handle the rest
We goin' in under the deck
Your body's under attack
One thing leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
One leads to
One thing, one thing, one thing
Leads to another
If it ain't one thing, it's always another
Word to abuela papi my mother
That's why one thing always leads to another
Mamita, I'm raw like no rubber
Like no other now take cover
Little weapon with no cover
I wanna be your friend and your lover
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
One thing leads to another
