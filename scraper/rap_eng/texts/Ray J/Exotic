Is how I describe you
Your honest
You make me feel like I can trust you
Take advantage of my space and time
You're so romantic
You know how to make a man feel fine

You took me swimming in the ocean
Had me flying cross the coast and
You always keep me focused (yeah hi yeah)
You told me, you love me
And in my heart I know you mean it
And no one can come between us (yeah hi yeah)

All of the things that you said to me
And all of the things that you did for me
All of these things just let me know you care
All of the things that you got for me
All of the things that you stop for me
All of these things just let me know you care

You're so special
You're the type of girl that is hard to find
And you're so faithful
I'm proud to say that you're all mine
Now that were together
I know the real meaning of love
And when I close my eyes
I still know is you just by your touch

You took me swimming in the ocean
Had me flying cross the coast and
You always keep me focused (yeah hi yeah)
You told me, you love me
And in my heart I know you mean it
And no one can come between us (yeah hi yeah)

All of the things that you said to me
And all of the things that you did for me
All of these things just let me know you care
All of the things that you got for me
And all of the things that you stop for me
All of these things just let me know you care

So gone
Baby we going to shine like crome
I know you hate being alone
So I'm going to take you far from home
And girl
I know you wanna try new things
Like a photo in a magazine
Of me and you together
You gotta trust me

All of the things that you said to me
And all of the things that you did for me
All of these things just let me know you care
And all of the things that you got for me
All of the things that you stop for me
All of these things just let me know you care

And you look so good
Yes you do
And it feel's so good
That somebody out there loves me to
And if anybody out there
Has been in love
Then it's easier to understand
When I say that she is the only one I'm thinking of
