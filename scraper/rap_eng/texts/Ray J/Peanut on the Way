I said the bail was $20 million, I know my nigga Peanut on the way
I said the bail was $20 million, I know my nigga Peanut on the way

[Verse: 1]
I keep them berry bonds on the breaks
A couple extra bitches for replacement
I put that cocaine on the table, making dollars and a .45 in a safe
I keep the horses washed in the stable
Three fararis and a old rafe
I bought the dime from my baby mama
I got my daughter going down and crazy
