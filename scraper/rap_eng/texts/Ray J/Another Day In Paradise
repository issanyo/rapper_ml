[Intro]
(Yeaheah) Heyey
(Yeaheah) Heyey (Paradise, paradise)
Heyey (Paradise, you and me)
Heyey

[Verse 1: Brandy]
She calls out to the man on the street:
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

[Hook]
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice
'Cause it's just another day for you, you and me in paradise
(Yeaheah)
Think about it, hey

[Verse 2: Ray J]
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying, yeah
(Yo, girl, why you're cryin'?)
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
(Let me help you out)
She can't walk but she's trying

[Hook]
Oh, think twice (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise (Paradise, oooh, yeah)
Oh (Think twice), think twice
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise

(Yeaheah) You and me in paradise
You and me (Yeaheah)
Just think about it
(Yeaheah)
Yeah, just think about it
Oh, yeah) (Yeaheah)
Think about it

[Bridge]
Oh, lord
Is there nothing more anybody can do?
Ohoho, lord (Ohoho, lord!)
There must be something you can say!

[Verse 3: Brandy & Ray J]
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there, yeah
She's probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

[Hook]
Oh, think twice (Think twice)
'Cause it's another day for you and me in paradise (Oh, yeah)
Oh, think twice (Think twice)
'Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise
Yeah yeah
(Oho, yeah, oho, yeah)
Just think about it, oooh
Think about it (Oh yeah)

[Outro]
It's just another day for you and me in paradise (Yeaheah)
It's just another day for you and me in paradise (Yeaheah)

It's just another day for you and me in paradise (Just think about it, think about it) (Yeaheah)
It's just another day for you and me in paradise (Yeaheah)
