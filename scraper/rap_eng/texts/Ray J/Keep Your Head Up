Whoaa, I see you walking with your head down girl
Come here, whoa, lemme lift your spirits up, aight
I got something on my mind I wanna tell you
Girl, when you down and when you out, you feeling low
Keep your head up baby
Girl, I can see, you've been going through some things
Walking head down, cause you feel so much pain
Blaming yourself, when it ain't even that way
Girl, why can't you see it's time for a change
It's why I'm talking to you, I wanna show the way
You don't have to, go through this one more day
If you take control, you dunno how far you go
Girl, listen to me, I'm telling you good things
Don't you understand me, I'm talking from my heart right now
Start doing things the right way, please do it that way

No matter what the world say, Keep on doing your things
Sometimes it won't be easy, but girl I got a message for you
Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you
Promise you'll get by, baby girl believe me
I know you're going through hard times, but you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up high
Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you
Promise you'll get by, baby girl believe me
And When you're going through hard times, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up high

I know it's hard to, to raise a kid on your own
I know it takes two, you didn't make alone
But his daddy's gone, and we know daddy's dead wrong
But you gotta keep, making those ends meet(yes, you do)
And girl, I know, you can do it by yourself
Even though soemtimes you feel like screaming for help
It won't be long til the hurt is gone
Girl, I'm telling you, see I know what to do
If you wanna treat me, I'm singing this for you
Start doing things the right way
Even though some times won't treat you good

No matter what the world say, Keep on doing your things
Sometimes it won't be easy, but girl I got a message for you
Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you
Promise you'll get by, baby girl believe me
I know you're going through hard times, but you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up high
Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you
Promise you'll get by, baby girl believe me
And When you're going through hard times, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up high

Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you
Promise you'll get by, baby girl believe me
And When you're going through hard times, you don't have to cry
Just keep your head up high

Oh, whoa, whoa (til end)
