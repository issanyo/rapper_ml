{All five models swallow... uh... knockout!... uh... yea... sexy... uh yea}

I see some ladies on the track (they sexy)
I put them ladies on they back (don't test me)
I double up {up} right before they sex me
And when I lick the ladies, it gets messy

I like to trick trick trick
I like to trick {trick} trick
I wanna spend some money, spend some money
I like to trick, I like to trick

Yea
I be trickin on them hoes, trickin on them hoes
Shoppin at the mall
I buy'em all these clothes
We hit the club v.I.p. {5 bottles, 5 models}
(All five models swallow)
We leave the club (club)
And end up in my bedroom, bedroom, bedroom
I be trickin on them hoes
Both about a paper
So after we fuck {see you later alligator}

I see some ladies on the track (they sexy)
I put them ladies on they back (don't test me)
I double up {up} right before they sex me
And when I lick the ladies, it gets messy

I like to trick trick trick
I like to trick {trick} trick
I wanna spend some money, spend some money
I like to trick, I like to trick
