Spoken:
Dang girl, I'm getting use to you
What, you, you, thinking about leaving
What, you, you going away
Naw, naw, naw
I, I need to know something
Right here (now?)

Where do we go from here
(where do we, where do we)
Where do we go from here
(Oooh, oh)
Where do we go from here
(where do we, where do we go)
Where do we go from here

You say you like my kissing and my hugging
You say you like the way that I be thugging
I know it's only been a few weeks but I
Feel like you're apart of me

And if you really wanna know
Just how far love can go
Well, first you gotta prove and show
And what I want to know is

Where do we go from here
(We've done about everything)
Where do we go from here

Where do we go from here
(Let's talk about it, let's talk about it, yeah)

I can't believe it
Your telling me your gonna be leaving
(wait a minute)
I can't be grieving
Please tell me I'm dreaming

But I really want you to know
I never felt like this before
So don't leave me in a world so cold
Cause it will be without you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Where do we go from here
(We've done about everything)
Where do we go from here
(I barely know your name)
Where do we go from here
(This love you say we share)
Where do we go from here
(I say, let's talk about it, let's talk about it, yeah)

(Where do we go from here)
Whooa whoa-oa
