Damn baby
I just don't understand were we went wrong
I gave you my heart
I gave you my soul
I gave you...
As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first
It was about 8 yrs ago, don't act like you don't know
We're were sitting at home in your mama's living room
'Cause we couldn't be alone Ã¢?? you see
Your mama knew I was something else she knew how I felt
Back then we were in school, and that's your favorite excuse
See growing up I was a fool and I can't lie I'm missing you
Listen and don't trip
I think I need a bottle with a genie in it, here's my wish list
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one
If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in?
If so then search and I'll go. Then I can have you for sho, then you'll be loving me, holding me, kissing, me Ã¢?? so girl don't tell me what I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose a second chance with you, I wouldn't know what to do. I'd probably check myself into some kind of clinic. I couldn't be alone because without you I'm sick
Here's my wish list:
First one, I would create a heart changing love
Second one, I'll take yours and fill it all the way up
Third one, but I don't need a lot of wishes cause I'd be okay if I get one
If I had one wish we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin
(Starting here right now)
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you (promise love) trust me I trust you. (I'll trust you)
If I had one wish, we would run away (yes we would), making love all day
(feel so good) have us a baby
If I had one wish
I'd (make you my whole life) make you my whole life and you'd be my wife
Make it right this time, if I had one wish
I don't even know how we ended upon this road;
And, even though we are grown, girl I just want you to know
If I had one wish, we would be best friends, love would never end, it would just begin
If I had one wish, you would be my boo, promise to love you, trust me I trust you
If I had one wish, we would run away, making love all day, have us a baby
If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life and you'd be my wife, make it right this time
If I had one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
One wish, one wish
