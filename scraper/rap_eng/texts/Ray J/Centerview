{Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah}

(Verse One)
I was just a young boy
Raised out in Carson
Ambla Elementary
Principal Dr. Larson
Me and my godbrotha
Tyrin Davis
Walkin down the hallways
He got all the ladies
I was just a nappy head
Livin on the 9 block
'ready went to Bedcross
I was at the chronic spot
Did a lil' rooster
And my homey shantwain-
And the homey Big B
Put me on the game
The big homey solo
Told me not to bang
He told me don't put
My career to a shame
But I did, anyway
And I got in trouble but
I had the hookup on the hundred dolla double ups
My nigga E-dog... he had the flow
And when I snuck out my window
I used to go smoke up his endo
Oh

(Verse Two)
My dad was always at Church
Working in his office
And my cousin Ryan got a
Scholarship to college
Everything start happening
All so quick- fast
I got on a TV show
And started to make cash
My sister's on the radio
Banging through the stereo
I remember when we used to go
Skate at Skate Depot
Damn those were the days
Things just ain't the same
And to my little homey D-O
You gotta be careful in this game

(Hook)
Cen...ter {oh yes you do}...view
{Listen, I was raised in a little town called}
Cen... {oh} ter... {yea} view {you see}

(Bridge)
Guess who I do it back
So all I do is that
So how I'm giving back
Put my city on the map
That's why I do it back
First time I held this track
So how I'm giving back
Put my city on the map

(Verse Three)
In Cen...ter...view

Oh, I used to take the circuit bus
To the Carson mall
To go buy cans of spray paint to
Hit up on the walls
I was young and dumb
I was livin' crazy
But thank God for my family, cuz
Man they really saved me, yeah
{Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh}
To everybody in my city
That remembers good times, oh oh
{Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh}
I took a ride back to Carson
Just to hug a few friends, oh oh
{Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh}
You see, I know I can get you chillin
On the block around ten, Oh oh
{Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh}
Ay, And all the soldiers that didn't go
Who are locked up in the pen
Woah...
In Centerview, Yeah
Woah... woah...
Well homey, this one's for you
