[Incomprehensible], you heard that? Let's go, come on
Baby, you don't know about me
'Coz if you did you wouldn't be
Acting, like you are too good for me
When everybody knows my name
An everybody's callin' you, crazy
Stop and think where you need to be
Girl, why do you say you don't want me?
When you know you do, you frontin'
When you know you wanna make your move
Stop playin' and do, baby, anything you want with me
It's crazy, 'coz everywhere I go
They're screaming Ray J
Baby, just in case you didn't know
You know that once you been with me
You never wanna leave
Its crazy, every shorty wants to be my baby
And baby, just in case you didn't know
You know that once you been with me

If I change my mind about you
Guaranteed there's one thing that I won't do
That's give a second chance to you
So if you're really checkin' for me

To be together doin' things my way
