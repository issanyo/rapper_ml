Yo, yo this one's for you boo (yeah), ha ha you know what's up, been drivin around in
My car wit the windows down just think about you, I'm trippin

From the way I introduced myself, she knew that I was stakin wealth
She wasn't in it for the dollars she had doe herself
I pulled up in my dirty ass Lexo, girl I've been workin hard so what you expect yo
She smiled and laughed and just that fast the way she made me feel had me trippin man
I think I felt this way befo', but see that girl wasn't feelin me so dat don't count yo
This mommy that I'm talkin bout she kind of light brown yo, the type to make me wear my seat belt and say baby please drive slow, Her ex man she (pause) she had to let him know
She don't need yo stress now 'cause she know I got dro, I think Ray J's the one you should
Fall fo' you have no idea how good I'll make ya feel, everything will be great and I'll always keep it real, so hop up in the driver's seat and dip on these chrome wheels

She's takin control, control of, me
She's takin control, control of, me
She's got me open and it's so deep
And I don't know what to do about it baby

She's takin control, control of, me
She's takin control, control of, me (she got me goin crazy)
She's got me doin things I can't believe
And I don't know what to do about it baby

I can't fake it love, 'cause everytime I open my eyes I picture me and you wakin up
She alway's teasin me doin that s*** stuff, now it's goin up and down and down and up
Sometimes she wears weaves and got a nice round butt, she like to smoke weed and not talk to much, She let me be me and not givin a fuck, and maybe one day I'll get her finger froze up, will see when we get older (older), but now I'm doin it Prince style
With the mink fox on my shoulders, "Heat" tucked in my tux pushin a vt?, She's always on my mind that's why I know she's controlin' me, She like's kissin and holdin me
And she real cool with my Moms and Brandy, my Pops and the rest of the family, that's another reason I thought she was right for me

She's takin control, control of, me
She's takin control, control of, me
She's got me open and it's so deep
And I don't know what to do about it baby

She's takin control, control of, me
She's takin control, control of, me (she got me goin crazy)
She's got me doin things I can't believe
And I don't know what to do about it baby
