Knock Out
DogChild

[Verse 1:]
Years and Feelings
Hopes and Wishes
How many of them we share
How many of them we dare
To show, To Grow
Promise not let it go
Now look, what we become
So gone now, And I don't even get it
How a love like ours could fall apart in one minute
I'm sleeping in a happy home
The next minute, I'm walking out an open door...

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off
Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

[Chorus:]
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel

[Verse 2:]
Now I remember when I first knew ya
And I was all that had on your mind
Did I ever mean anything to ya
Or was I just something you did to pass the time
Cause now you won't hear me out
You ain't even tryin to work it out
But I ain't going back
And even though I'm scared
I got too much pride
So I'm in my ride...

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off
Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

[Chorus:]
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel

[Bridge:]
What you gonna do when you miss my love?
I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love
I thought what we had was real
And the pain is all I feel...
What you gonna do when you miss my love?
I guarantee that you're gonna miss my love
I thought what we shared was real
And the pain is all I feel

So I'm Driving...

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I'm driving down the rear way, swerving off
Trying to get myself together, Hoping I don't cry
Wanting to be together
But this feeling getting worse
Oh I never thought I ever feel this hurt

[Chorus:]
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
So I'm hoping like hell that it ain't 4real
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
Wishing that it ain't but I know that it is
2 days ago I felt like a star
2 hours ago just lost my heart
Now it's all I feel, it's all I feel
It's all I feel, it's all I feel
