[Hook]
Giving you my love, mixing with a drink
Then we toast it up, sex on the beach
Oh na na na
Oh na na na
Got a real good girl, what a beast in the shit
Oh na na na, oh na na na

[Verse 1]
I can lean her body
Oh na na na, oh na na na
I just wanna fall in love and she just wanna have fun
Oh na na na, oh na na na
And this one here is for my lady

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She call me when she feel like messing above
When she hit me up, I've been putting it down
When we hit the club, she could turn it down
Way her body making no sounds
Is tripping like ohh oh oh oh
She got it like oh oh oh oh
And this one here is for my lady

[Hook x2]
