[INTRO]
Yeah.. I been tryna get away
But it's just something about you that's pullin' me back in
Ya know?

[Hook]
Girl ya what I need!
And I can't even front I'm wildin' out
Plannin' on you can calm me down
You make it alright when you're around
Girl you what I need!

[VERSE]
I know, you think
I'm just sayin'
All these things cause you're here now
And I know what you're thinkin'
If this is true... Then why didn't I do
All these things when I had you

[BRIDGE]
It's because I knew
You had quite enough
But I feel brand new and I'm fessin' up

[Hook]
Girl you what I need!
And I can't even front I'm wildin' out
Plannin' on you can calm me down
You make it alright when you're around
Girl you what I need!
And you know that you're all I think about
Plannin' on we can work it out
I'm tired of the games stop playin' around
Girl you what I need!

[VERSE]
The first time I got caught up...
I swear it wasn't even in my plans.. I got caught up in some how... And I dont know what I was thinkin'...
But thats back in o' 02.. In o' 05 .. I'm brand new... In o' 06 won't be seen without you

[BRIGDE]

[Hook]

[BREAKDOWN]
Let me take you over this bridge
So won't you tell me
That we're not supposed to be
And that I'm not ready
To give you what you need
So won't you tell me
There's no way that you could be
And more than in love with me
Cause' you're all that I need (Whoooooa)

[Hook] (2x)

(I been wildin' in the club screamin' r&b and thug
But I don't wanna live that life no more!)
Girl you what I need!
Girl you what I need!
