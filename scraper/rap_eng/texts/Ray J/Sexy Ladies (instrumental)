Now she's in the doodle drop top Phantom

She's so sexy, I swear this no lie
She got swag, got cash, she's so fly
She came in with no man, I don't know why
'Cause by the end of the night you know she guard out

So I look her in the eyes
Tell her I could have a peek and hide in the skies
Yes she might be fun, but she a freak under the skies
When it's dark she could light up the night
She's so sexy
