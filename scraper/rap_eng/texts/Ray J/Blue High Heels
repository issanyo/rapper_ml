Oh yeah
Look at you s*** thang
Umm you so s*** girl

[Chorus:]
You got it, s*** appeal... I said you looking so good in them blue high heels
Your body, is what I wanna feel... I said you lookin so good in them blue high heels... Yea yea yea

[Verse:]
Baby, look at how you wearing that coat. Got me thinking in my head, how could I get to know you, a lil
Better... Wanna walk right up to you, and tell you how could them jeans fit on you, and, how could you walk
In them shoes, and, how could you do what you do

[Repeat Chorus]
Baby baby baby, I can't seen to understand, how you could make anything you wear look name brand... And baby
Baby baby, the way you sit and the way you stand, will make a almost married man think about changing
Plans...
That's why I say that you

[Repeat Chorus]
[Brigde]

Shawty the way you talk te way you walk, just turns me on... One kiss under the misale toe, I just wish you
Were me woman, like a holiday that never ends is how I feel, I can't help but say your so beautiful in them blue high heels

[Repeat Chorus]
