Yea welcome to my life (raydiation)
City of carson thats where i grew up (yea)
Thats where i knew of (the view) thats all i knew of (yea)
In kindegarten until i got out of skoo i started to hang with the fools i went from here to bad news
Then ma sister started to blow up i saw the money just go up but i hardly saw her and my mother i used to
Hang round the corner i felt like i was a loner but i got love for my homies
I started changin flirtin with gang bangin had the hook up on ol' skoo so everyday i was out hangin and
Then i heard gun shots they aimin at my head and thats when the fun stopped cuz next i might be dead i
Called my mama on the phone said this is your son i need some help im in a whole lot of trouble and can't
Get through by myself they shot out a plane and flew me out no doubt i said goodbye to my friends then
Disappeared in the clouds they told me ray j you gotta turn yourself around now or throw it all away and
Lay six feet in the ground
Im totally focused i gotta move forward i hear my callin this time i just won't ignore it into the future
Throw all the past and then you came and you can grow....
