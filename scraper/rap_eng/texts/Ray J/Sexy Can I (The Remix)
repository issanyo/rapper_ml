(feat. Yung Berg)
Sexy can I
Yeah, Yeahhh
All we wanna know is...

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna no is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then were back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
[Young Berg:]
Wat up Lil mama, it's ya boy Youngin
G5 dippin, lui vuitton luggage (ay)
Gotta love it, ya boy so fly
All the ladies go (ohhh) when a nigga ride by
Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend, she ain't missed him since
SEXY CAN I
[Ray J:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, keep it on the low
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the moe-moe
You can bring a friend, or you can ride solo
Let me get my camera, so we can take a photo
(Oh, ohh, ohh) go shawty, go shawty
Baby when we make love it's like, (Oh, ohh, ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but shawty all I want to know is)
Sexy can I
Sexy can I, visit you at work
When you sliding down the pole
No panties, no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole
Then you drop and do a splitts
How you make that pussy talk
Baby damn, u is a mess
(Oh, ohh, ohh)go shawty, go shawty
I make it rain in the club like (Oh, ohh, ohh)
(I don't know what your man is like but baby all I want to know is)
Sexy can I
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
[Young Berg:]

When I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin'
See I'm a go getta and she a go getta
You already know she a...
(Sexy can I)
Sexy can I sing for you red-eye
Fresh out the pool no towel
Let it air dry
And if you ain't fuckin tonight
You can watch our tour bus go by

[Chorus:]
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (oh baby)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
Sexy can I, hit it from the front
Then I hit it from the back
Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then were back at it for more
Sexy can I, just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a playa like (ohhh)
It's a kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy can I
