[Verse 1]
Real niggas by my side, I salute ya
Praises to all mighty God, Hallelujah
I got that work for customers and consumers
My name is dirt, from all of these fuckin rumors
I put my bottom bitch up in Zuma
I think they tappin on my phones in Taluga
I got a 100 thousand stashed in the cooler
And I still got my connect down in Cuba
Mix that white girl with the Kalua
Couple shots of codeine, that'll do ya
Found a wife just for the night and ?
Tonight she gon be my sweetie ? with junior
She suckin on my dick like a Hookah
Damn she got that ? brain, she a tutor
This is for you fuck niggas, here's a Ruger
I'll give you nightmares like I'm Kruger
I dive in, I go deep, like a scuba
Front to back, side to side, I manoeuvre
Ridin through the streets in something crazy
Back to back in my new Ghost, Patrick Swayze

[Hook]
Oooohh Oooohh Oooohh Ohh (aha)
Oooohh Oooohh Oooohh, Patrick Swayze Ohh
Oooohh Oooohh Oooohh Ohh (aha)
Oooohh Oooohh Oooohh, Patrick Swayze Ohh

[Verse 2]
I got that molly water, Aquafina
That holy water will make you a believer
And to you fuck boys and wife beaters
I hope that Grim Reaper come and see ya
I remember Brandy introduced me to Aaliyah
Right around the time a nigga died in Gardena
And if she feel my pain, roll the weed up
And if she feel my pain, roll the weed up
The mushrooms will make you go ape shit
That cocaine will make you take eight shits?
And if you fuck with me you'll make the A-list
And if you try to fuck with me you'll make the papers
Courtside seats, LA Lakers
My Maybach seats, alligator
Ridin through the streets in something crazy
Back to back in my new Ghost, Patrick Swayze

[Hook]
