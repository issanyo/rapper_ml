Got out the drug on 17
Showing Cali love in in this Miami heat
Gettin hugs from chicks with pretty feat
Belly rings, tight ass tops and curly wigs
In broad day light freaks already out
Chasing my nigga's with the gold tooth in there mouth
Head up, with the least to get some drinks
Thinking "man I love South Beach"

[Chorus:]
Is unbelievable
Crazy, holding it down in 102 degrees
Is unbelievable
Call Missy, tell her I'm in town I got my crew with me
Is unbelievable
With exotic chicks so hell and thick and no speak english
Is unbelievable
My sister try to tell me it would be like this
Is unbelievable

Code everything, nigga this is some shit straight out of magazine
School riding underneath the palm trees
Diping up and down the beat on the street
7 street my cel is ringing this tone
Tell me club edge, I'm soft like after 10
The dress code is thrown and la clean
I know I might like the scene

[Chorus:]
Is unbelievable
Crazy, holding it down in 102 degrees
Is unbelievable
Call Missy, tell her I'm in town I got my crew with me
Is unbelievable
With exotic chicks so hell and thick and no speak english
Is unbelievable
My sister try to tell me it would be like this
Is unbelievable

[Rap]

[Chorus:]
Is unbelievable
Crazy, holding it down in 102 degrees
Is unbelievable
Call Missy, tell her I'm in town I got my crew with me
Is unbelievable
With exotic chicks so hell and thick and no speak english
Is unbelievable
My sister try to tell me it would be like this
Is unbelievable
