She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir can you help me?"
It's cold and I've no where to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
He starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
And me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for
And me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh lord, there must be something you can say
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for
And me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in this
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's just another day for
And me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause It's just another day for you
You and me in paradise
Just think about it
It's just another day for you and me in Paradise
It's just another day for you and me in Paradise
It's just another day for you and me in Paradise
