Verse 1:
This one's for my girl
I don't need a new babe
I need you to act right
No Instagram tooth pic
You in a shabby dress looking nice
Even some hand-me-downs (yeah)
You shine brighter than the city lights
Mary J got you feeling a way
Kendrick say "we gonna be alright"

We don't have to start no song, no

Chorus:
We can press replay, replay
And go back to the Summer with the DJ, the summer with the DJ
Girl you know that I been missing that sweet taste, sweet taste
Lovin' and your body till your knees shake, drop top driving down the freeway
And everyday we're gonna press replay
We gon have to start a new song and we can press replay

Verse 2:
New girl want to dine in France
All crazy with hors d'oeuvres
Your order sort of cost a few pennies
I hope you ordered some nerves
If your lips was a sweet as a Swisher
It would help me with the urge
If you threw me to bed like a dinner
We would throw it back like an 80s perm

Chorus:
We can press replay, replay
And go back to the Summer with the DJ, the summer with the DJ
Girl you know that I been missing that sweet taste, sweet taste
Lovin' and your body till your knees shake, drop top driving down the freeway
And everyday we're gonna press replay
We gon have to start a new song and we can press replay (no)

Verse 3:

In the room full of chicks, they all should duck
Quack quack quack quack she doesn't want to young buck
Sinatra said you're the lady luck
You could blow on these dice, but don't move too much

Chorus:
We can press replay, replay
And go back to the Summer with the DJ, the summer with the DJ
Girl you know that I been missing that sweet taste, sweet taste
Lovin' and your body till your knees shake, drop top driving down the freeway
And everyday we're gonna press replay
We gon have to start a new song and we can press replay
