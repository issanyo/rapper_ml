[Chorus: Ray J]
Pulled up, wait a minute
Slow up, put your legs up in it girl
And gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
No one do it like you
You on one, I just wanna see
Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
You know what it is, Kid Ink baby
Baby, come and get a tip, I think you deserve it
Your body full equipped, drop it like drip
Bad little well, I just need a minute
Gimme what you got, lemme see you flex
Sign on the dot, got that ass in check
Now gon' do you dance, girl do it
I'mma sit and watch, it's a movie

[Chorus: Ray J]
Pulled up, wait a minute
Slow up, put your legs up in it girl
And gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
No one do it like you
You on one, I just wanna see
Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
What you on? Let me see it
Say you poison girl, I got the medicine
Ciroc and Belvedere, party over here
Throw my westside in the air, make sure the coast is clear
Wrap it though, all I get it rapping dough
Ratchet from the window to the wall like racket ball
Let me see that ass girl, I'm just being rational
She said that additional, why you being difficult?
Gon' girl dip it low, standing on your tippytoes
Body like a centrefold, let me see you strike a pose

[Chorus: Ray J]
Pulled up, wait a minute
Slow up, put your legs up in it girl
And gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
No one do it like you
You on one, I just wanna see
Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got

[Verse 3: Ray J]
What am I, what am I gon' do with all this money?
Throw it in the air but you gotta give it to me now
Take it to the top, drop stop
Pop, I'mma sit and watch like
You ain't gotta hold back, all on me, put it on my tab now
Take another shot shot shot shot, feel it getting hot, girl you got that fire

[Chorus: Ray J]
Pulled up, wait a minute
Slow up, put your legs up in it girl
And gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
No one do it like you
You on one, I just wanna see
Gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
Gimme gimme what you got, gimme gimme what you got
