[Hook]
I love my bitches [x3]
Yeah I got love [x5]

[Verse 1 – Ray J]
You can feel my love when we’re both intoxicated
Yeah, baby you can feel my love, like the blunt, we getting faded
I beat the pussy up, I don’t even got to pay
I fucked a couple bitches I don’t even want to say
I got a couple bitches in LA and in the Bay
Shout out to all my bitches with a baby on the way

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Too Short]
I got rookies, I got pros
I got a good girl, I got hoes
I got a church girl, and you know
I’m going out tonight and Imma get a few more
I can have any of em anytime I wanna
On top, not just with one thing in common
They love daddy, everything I love is real
They know exactly how I feel
All of mine are experienced, I don’t like when a bitch is too innocent
Get a towel girl, wipe it off your cheek
I fucked you for a week, now you my little freak
You need to meet my other bitch
If you ain’t cool with her, you can’t fuck with this
And every time you see me, it’s pay day
Bitches say they love me

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 3 – Ray J]
Burkas to my girls on the left
Red bottoms all on they feet
Presidentials all on they wrist
You know my Miami girls got the heat
My east coast girls get they drank on
My west coast girls smoke weed
My down south girls so bless
My Midwest, up north girls, I love
