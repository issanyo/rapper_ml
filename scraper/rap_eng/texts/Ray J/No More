Can I undertsand?
Can I undertsand?
Can I undertsand?
Oh no I can't

I know so much it's gon on between me and you
Baby, oh yeah
So block my feelings, put on my side
So you can have your way
Same seven digit round around
And stay now so late
But I ain't gon sweat you
Cause you know that I'm crazy
What am I supposed to do without you baby
What am I supposed to do and you're gone
So I gotta let you know that I'm gone, I'm gone

Wow, I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love
I don't wanna know you baby, no more
I don't wanna know, wow
I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love

I don't wanna know you (no more)
Or hold you (no more)
Or see you (no more)
You must not know who I am
If you really think that I give a damn
Just wanna see you gone
With someone else do your own things
Just leave me alone
How could you ever think that I
Would have a blind heart
You ain't that smart, so as far as you go
Baby, gotta let you know that I

Wow, I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love
I don't wanna know you baby, no more
I don't wanna know, wow
I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love

I don't really want you, no more
I don't really want you, so long so long
I don't really want you, I don't need you
I don't really want you, I don't love you
I don't really want you, no more
Please don't call me anymore
Ray J don't love ya
Ray J don't need ya
Don't wanna see your name on my call id

Wow, I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love
I don't wanna know you baby, no more
I don't wanna know, wow
I can understand
But it's cool you don't lost my love
