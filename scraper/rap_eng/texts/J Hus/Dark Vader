[Intro]
If I can't, if I can't, if I can't, if I can't

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend

[Verse 1]
Black boy come like a dark Vader
Gyal there lookin' like a Tomb Raider
Call my guy, tell him "do me one favour"
Leave the ends, come back a month later
All the praise goes to the Maker
Auntie put rice in the container
If that gyal bad then I must take her
I'm not a stealer, I'm a taker
He don't wanna grind, he's a complainer
Dem man never done a hard labour
I don't know what I want, but I want paper
Sit back, roll up a one paper
They wan' do me like Nelson Mandela
Talk about gyal, man get hella
Too much gyal, I got a dilemma
Hood gyal wearin' bandana

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend

[Verse 2]
I swear they can't do it how we do it
Every time I done it, I say "I didn't do it"
When I came with the clique, it's like everybody thought
It was G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Laugh at the old stress cuh we been through it
Pull up on anyone I got an issue with
Wanna learn how to hustle? I can teach you it
Every L I took, man, I needed it
Now the whole hood see me on the big tele
If that gyal bad, give her big belly
You see me with the clique, yeah, the clique deh deh
Man haffi roll up a big zeggae
Tell all the gangsta dem to loosen up
I like that gyal with a beauty spot
I stepped out of bed, I was Gucci'd up
I only make racks, I don't do too much

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
If I can't have you, nobody can
Bare face so they all know who I am
If you saw what the skeng done to the man
You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend

[Outro]
Black boy come like a dark Vader
Gyal there lookin' like a Tomb Raider
Call my guy, tell him "do me one favour
Leave the ends, come back a month later"
All the praise goes to the Maker
Auntie put rice in the container
If that gyal bad then I must take her
I'm not a stealer, I'm a taker
