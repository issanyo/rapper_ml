[Verse 1]
We was in the field like a Sparta
Standing right outside the barber
Manna aim for the medulla oblongata
See my running from Jake or the guarder
Tell them it's a mistake, I'm a rapper
These times I'm Jay-Jay Okocha; midfield, attacker
Go and ask Tasha and Sasha
Work rate masher
They way I just- way I just blow 50 racker
Throw away the wave cap; grow a mini afro
Thought I was a yard man, but I'm really aff though
They don't really ride out; they don't really bang though
I sex gyal on camera, she thought I was a bang bro
I don't ever call back, she calling me an arsehole
Talking to me is like talking to a brick wall
Man's shirt red up
Thought it was a paintball
Left man water, thought it was a rainfall
They need a hit made? I'm the one they call
Call me the hitman, leng man, sick man, hangman, stick man
I'm the equivalent of 5 man, 6 man
You know I'm a lick, that's why gang wan' lick man
Heard I do magic like Johnson
Looking in the attic for the boonsam
Had me in the can like bronson
Why they wan'-
