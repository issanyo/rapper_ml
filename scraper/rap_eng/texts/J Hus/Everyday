[Chorus: Baseman]
I go hard for my niggas
Go hard for my famo and I do that shit like everyday
I go hard for the p's
Get it in by any means and I do that shit like everyday
Like pussy nigga I can read you
And to all them new friends I don't need you
And if you see me in my hood, I can wear any colour that I want
Cause my squad knows I bleed blue

[Verse 1: Baseman]
I'm from the 7th, I can show you how my dargs move
Stand your ground like there's nowhere to run to
Sip double cups, my bitches hold cups too
My ting's got big cups too
No love for a snitch and a loose lip
Just a beam and some fiends and a few sticks
Any time, any place, we can do this
If the niggas want beef, tell them 'chew this'
Cos my life's like a movie I'm rolling with the 9's
Niggas talking reckless we let the ting rise
Looking too suave baby I'm not tryina fight
All I'm tryna say is 'can I be your man for the night'
But fam I can't lie, yeah I've done some fuckery
Cause I've been through fuckery, only God can judge me
I'm from a place where you can hold a slug for your bredrin
And take man for a fool? I can't let him
Like fuck that I can't let him
When I see him, bare shots I'm a send him
Coming from the 7th, we apply pressure
Call the ref when I slide, I'm a leave him on the stretcher
Niggas are pathetic
You know I'm gon' eat like gourmet
For the p's I'll be chilling near your place
Me and my hittas in the whip, posted all day
Hit the lick then we split the P's four ways

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: J Hus]
(Hustler baby)
I'm from London City
Where your day one friends could be paigons tomorrow
The devil came around and my soul got borrowed
She called and I followed, and she just swallows
She gives me head in the shower
I think she's brainwashed
All she wants is the money and the fame
All I need is the money
That's why I'm out here everyday, everyday
Feeling like Shabba, Mr Loverman
She gives me ucky then she tells me that she loves her man
Me, I don't understand
I've got my mind on the money, gave my heart to the hustle
I need more than a couple grand
Who needs love when you've got mula?
Who needs friends when you've got burners?
It's the same shit everyday
The devil keeps begging to stay
And the trouble keeps heading my way

[Chorus]
