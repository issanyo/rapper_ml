[Intro]
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Leave me alone and let me bun my reefa
It's like everyday is beef with another geezer
They don't like me, I roll with a common squeezer
He done a bait ting and flew straight to Dominic, Dominica
In the big Benzo with the drugger dealer
Might pull up on Keisha, I do it just to tease her
Call her princess, just to uplift her
I know an arm robber, used to be a shoplifter
Now me and him got beef, and we no longer speak
Still walk his nan across the street
Still put that motherfucker in a body bag
Still, help his mother with her shopping bags
I'm with a surgeon and a chemist
Steak and lettuce, when we're peckish for the day that I perish
Put me in Chanel, Hermes as well
Baby, can't you tell, that the only thing you want?

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I am, I say I'm good-do-do-do-do-do
Carry something sounding, like do-do-do-do-do
They watching everyting, I do-do-do-do-do
Mind my own business, like do-do-do-do-do
If you ask me how I am, I say I'm good-do-do-do-do-do
Carry something sounding, like do-do-do-do-do
They watching everyting, I do-do-do-do-do
Mind my own business, like do-do-do-do-do

[Verse 2]
Ayo, that ting's lookin' like a hippo
I'm a creep and a sicko
Creep through your window
Turn your mistress, widow
Got my key in the dippo
Ugly Betty in the pillow
Niggas ain't stickin' to the code
You know this couldn't happen if VV wasn't road
Reckless mode, no fish to bode
My niggas on license, so no trips abroad
Can't leave no sticks with broads, I don't know who she fucks with
Really I'm a big kid, Capri-Sun and Wotsits
My only accomplish was the wap stick
All the shit we accomplished, biscuits in the moshpit
Nobody knows who popped it, you smelt it, you dealt it
Don't hold me back, nigga, get off
That ting lookin' like a giraffe
See it when I walk past
Judge you over your past
And the same old task
Hates to change the forecast
Boulders in all four cars

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I am, I say I'm good-do-do-do-do-do
Carry something sounding, like do-do-do-do-do
They watching everyting, I do-do-do-do-do
Mind my own business, like do-do-do-do-do
If you ask me how I am, I say I'm good-do-do-do-do-do
Carry something sounding, like do-do-do-do-do
They watching everyting, I do-do-do-do-do
Mind my own business, like do-do-do-do-do
