[Intro]
JAE5

[Hook]
Got the littlest clique like 8 man
Our fingers click when we shake hands
I'll take a risk and I'll take chance
I pull up quick, make it break dance (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He was dancing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dancing like a dancing man
He was dancing like a dancing man

[Verse 1]
I step, I step and I step again
Then I glide, watch my left foot slide
The man can't ride if he's not qualified
Tell gyal open, open leg wide
And I'm keeping it moving
Them man sleeping and snoozing
You need a solution, we caused a commotion
Still ten steps ahead, that's even if I walk in slow motion

[Hook]
Got the littlest clique like 8 man
Our fingers click when we shake hands
I'll take a risk and I'll take chance
I pull up quick, make it break dance (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He was dancing, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dancing like a dancing man
He was dancing like a dancing man

[Refrain]
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
He was sleeping, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sleeping like a sleeping man
Sleeping like a sleeping man

[Verse 2]
I rep, I rep and I rep again
Keep it on my side everytime I slide
A man can't ride if it not certified
Tell gyal open, open leg wide
I keep to the plan if I creep on a man
Please understand, he gon' sleep where he stand
Them man can't even speak to a man
How am I gonna speak to a sleeping man?
