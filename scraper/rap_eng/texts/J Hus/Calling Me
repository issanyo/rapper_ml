J.O.A.T
Hustla Baby
Hustla Baby
AuhAuhAuh
AuhAuhAuh
Oh My

[Hook]
Ringa'Linga'Ling
That's the money calling
Ringa'Linga'Ling
That's the money calling me
Ringa'Linga'Ling
That's the money calling
Ringa'Linga'Ling
That's the money calling me
Ringa'Linga'Ling
That's the money calling me

[Verse 1]
You're the one that I'm talking to
Watching me when I'm passing through
Got shades on like I can't see you
No say me fancy you
AuhAuhAuh
Coz I'm a burner boy
And you like the thrill
But Baby Girl
Take time and chill
Coz I'm a hustla baby
And I'll be on my grind
Till I find a mill
Sorry Mrs Jackson
I never meant to make your daughter cry
And If I ever said I loved her
It's all a lie
AuhAuhAuh
It's all a lie
AuhAuhAuh
I ain't got time for the love and affection
It's the money that gets all my attention
I ain't got time for the love and affection
It's the money that gets all my attention
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, the money keeps calling
I can't stay around
For the love and a pound
Imma lay a Nigga down
Ringa'Linga'Ling
Now I gotta leave home
Shorty don't trust me
Coz I got three phones
Waits for the night
But there's nothing in the fridge
Thinking somethings gotta give
Now I'm getting money'lidge
I need a life far away from the ends
Fuck the trap
I don't wanna weigh this again
Yo, I ride for the money
And if it came to it
Would you ride with me
Baby Girl I'm more than
What you're eyes can see
You really don't know man
You think I'm just a road man
With no goals and no plans
I ain't got time for no love and affection
It's the money that gets all my attention
I ain't got time for no love and affection
It's the money that gets all my attention

[Hook x4]
