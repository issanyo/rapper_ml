[Intro: Swae Lee]
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh (JAE5)
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me (I know)

[Verse 1: J Hus]
I know you had enough for them other guys
They only came and fed you a bag of lies
Gyal you ain't gotta compromise
A real G, thought you would give me butterflies
I see yourself through your eyes
Pray for me, it's a war zone outside
I pull up, I pull up
You jump inside
I pull up, I pull up
You jump inside

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey

[Hook: Swae Lee]
And you are unforgettable (unforgettable)
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage

[Verse 2: French Montana & J Hus]
Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head, but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it
Truth say i'm hood and fly
Truth say your ex was a nonsense guy
I ain't perfect but man's just try
Look how quick this month went by
African man, Caribbean ting
Frying plantain, she call me plantain
Flying on a plane to release your senses
Who do you love? Who do you believe in?

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm
While she push up against me, ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for 24
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancin' like GoGo, hey

[Hook: Swae Lee]
And you are unforgettable (unforgettable)
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage

[Verse 3: French Montana & J Hus]
You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
I know you had enough for them other guys
They only came and fed you a bag of lies
Gyal you ain't gotta compromise
I see yourself through your eyes
Pray for me, it's a war zone outside
I pull up, I pull up
You jump inside
I pull up, I pull up
You jump inside

[Hook: Swae Lee]
And you are unforgettable (unforgettable)
I need to get you alone (oeh)
Why not? A fuckin' good time never hurt nobody
I got a little drink, but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

[Outro: Swae Lee]
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
