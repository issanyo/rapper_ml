[Hook]
Skinny nigga, haffi mashing some work
They be talking like say the machine don't work
Like we never bang it in traffic y'know
Man are moving erratic y'know
Then abandon the car
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports
We outside
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports

[Verse 1]
She asked me what I do, I said I play for the Gunners
Pray for my brothers cus' they staged in the gutters
Face lookin' butters
Man I stage with the shotters
We will stay in the rubbers
Ain't no place for you suckers
They don't understand me so they really can't stand me
Posted on the block till the feds came and banned me
I took a little L, now these niggas think they run shit
When we had your brothers running i guess it runs in your family
Macdees drive through
10 pound choppa
I'm a bait face, ill still run up on ya hotspot
In my mouse knuckles, got me feeling like a hotshot
I turn the Hilton Hotel into a hotbox
Only rapper in my team, I can't do no cyphers
All i know is trappers, bangers and a couple lifers
Five jibs on a Pinky and its lookin' iceless
Just to see the look on your face, that shit is priceless

[Hook]
Skinny nigga, I've been mashing some work
They be talking like say the machine don't work
Like we never bang it in traffic y'know
Man are moving erratic y'know
Then abandon the car
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports
We outside
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports

[Verse 2]
Come against me, you'll live a life of regret
I'm the kinda' guy to even show your wifey respect
And you know she's so friendly so we kinda' connect
So when I'm outside her crib, you know that wifi connects
Got me leaning on some older niggas from a different era
Big man like you making school boy errors
I know 16 fellas, I can never be one
Made 16 jealous, you're the 17th one
If they dont want to see me, Iâ€™ll bring the mountain to Muhammed
Now its boydem on the scene, now their runnin' up the damage
Mumsy still calls me her pride and joy
She knows I'm no good, she said boys will be boys
Make chedda, fuck a next bredda', they got a vendetta
No profit, no budget, them niggas hold grudges
Cash earner, what murder he's talking burner, burner
Oh stop it, why pop it, nigga you won't pop it

[Hook]
Skinny nigga, I've been mashing some work
They be talking like say the machine don't work
Like we never bang it in traffic y'know
Man are moving erratic y'know
Then abandon the car
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports
We outside
We just playing sports, sports, sports, sports, sports

[Outro]
She asked me what I do, I said I play for the  Gunners
Pray for my brothers cus'  their staged in the gutters
Face looking' butters
Man I stage with the shottas
We will stay in the rubbers
Ain't no place for you shucks
She asked me what I do, I said I play for the gunners
Pray for my brothers cus' they staged in the gutters
Face looking' butters
Man I stage with the shotters
We will stay in the rubbers
Ain't no place for you suckers
