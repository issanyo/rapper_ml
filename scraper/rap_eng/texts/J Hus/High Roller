[Intro]
Zino Records (Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...)

[Hook: J Hus]
Hopped in the tinted wagon
What's the worst that could happen?
That hasn't already happened
I've been outdoors for days
Getting paid in different ways
You wouldn't know money if it slapped you in your face
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor

[Verse 1: Nines]
Come through looking fly in some designers
Always got it, can't catch me sliding in these sliders
Even at the red carpet event we had them straps on base
I only do push-ups if I catch a case
I'm just a skinny nigga with a army
Stepped my game up from the Mini to the 'rarri
See them niggas acting like they're bosses, they're frauds
I shut it down in my city plus I be flossing abroad
Came through in a Audi or in that Honda Accord
All this gold got me looking like a Oscar Award
You ain't getting show money how you keep flossing?
Rocks in the ring, ain't fighting Steve Austin
I got all these model bitches on me to fuck
They wanna hit the cling on me like when I'm re'ing up
Hit the block for fresh air, write some new lyrics
Got the feds tryin' to tap me down every two minutes

[Hook: J Hus]
Hopped in the tinted wagon
What's the worst that could happen?
That hasn't already happened
I've been outdoors for days
Getting paid in different ways
You wouldn't know money if it slapped you in your face
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor

[Verse 2: Nines]
Me and the gang coming like some Arabs
Spending all this crack money up in Harrods
Just whipped up see the white under my nails
Told my nigga fix up cah we don't fight over girls
Got himself a mix up tryna line up some bells
Twenty bricks up off a Q, bike and some scales
If I blow I don't have to share
Went broke tried to reach out, all them niggas left me hanging like a chandelier
Everyday a nigga hustle
Wrapping up in the trap house playlist on shuffle
Still post on the strip
These lazy niggas chill in bed
My nigga Keyz and Pappy probably wrapped up a mill' in pebs
My new chick keeps the ting inside her blouse
And she ain't been to my crib, I got a sidechick house
And I still don't go home until my food's done
Even bring the four fizzy on me in a school run

[Hook: J Hus]
Hopped in the tinted wagon
What's the worst that could happen?
That hasn't already happened
I've been outdoors for days
Getting paid in different ways
You wouldn't know money if it slapped you in your face
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor
I'm the high roller, bipolar in the fly motor

[Outro: Nines]
Don't compare me to none of these rappers, B
We're nothing alike
Niggas be rapping my life
Free the team
Ice City going platinum baby!
