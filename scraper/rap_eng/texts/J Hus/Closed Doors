[Intro]
Close the door, close the door

[Chorus]
What happens behind closed doors
Close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do
What happens behind closed doors
Close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do

[Verse 1]
Baby, pay me a visit
Why you chillin' by yourself at home?
Spare key, under the doormat (yeah)
So you can make yourself at home
Before you come through, I beg you grab man some Rizla
I'm waitin' by the door, that's 'cause I miss ya
Confiscate your phone, why you always on Insta?
Bite your bottom lip, I'm a badman lipser (rah, rah)
You wanna see somethin'
Boom boom chat, I'll give you sweet lovin'
I'll beat the box, whilst I'm beatboxin'
Still round one, and you ain't seen nuttin'
This ain't no quick beat
It's like I'm digging for gold, baby, I dig deep
Still piffin' my zoot, 'bout to give you some yutes
I'm too big for my boots
Know what they say about niggas with big feet?
I'ma give it to you all, give you everythin'
And even take you where you never been
Put my finger in your coochie, then I put it in ya mouth
That's a taste of your own medicine
She won't say a word, she won't say nun'
Make you taste your own pussy, now cat got your tongue
Handcuff you to the bed
I hope you don't mind
Love is blind, so I blindfold you

[Chorus]
What happens behind closed doors
Close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here stays in here
I know you want it just as much as I do
What happens behind closed doors
Close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do

[Verse 2]
Didn't want to make you shy
Maybe I am just crazy high
But is it strange if I sit back and just pree you?
Undress you with my naked eye?
Set pace quickly
Baby, did you miss me?
Listen, white strippin', drippin', lingerie missin'
No need to discuss this 'cause nobody ever do you any justice
Girl, you're good food, I told you from the start
They say good food is a key to a man's heart
You do it better, so I managed to see you
Is there somethin' in my pocket, or am I happy to see you?
You grip and rub, your lips and jub
You lovin' off my bits and bobs
Baby, are you on, what I am on? One on one
Five rounds straight, all over, all over the drum

[Chorus]
What happens behind closed doors, close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do
What happens behind closed doors, close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do

[Outro]
What happens behind closed doors
Close the door behind you
Whatever happens in here, stays in here
I know you want it, just as much as I do
