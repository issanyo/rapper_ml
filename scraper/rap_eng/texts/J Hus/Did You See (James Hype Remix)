[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done?

[Verse 1]
Came looking like a ganja farmer
Your daddy better hide his daughter
Shake her bunda just like I taught her
Splashed her bunda with holy water
Lickle spice for the winter season
Your chicken needs a lickle season (Yeah)
Did you see what he did?
The black Benz turn white and they can't believe it
Make 'em repeat it
That's some new shit, they've never seen it
You should feel it, meet and greet it
I would be a genius if I didn't think with my penis
Gyaldem thinkin' I'm awesome
Mandem approach with caution
True say we came with the bonsam
But true say we came for the bunda
Some round ting that I can put my paws on

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done? (yeah)
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done?
Did you, did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done?
Did you, did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done?
Did you see what I done? (yeah)

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When niggas wanna try somethin'
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
Did you see what I done? (yeah)
Did you see what I done? (yeah)
