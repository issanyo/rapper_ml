[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
Why I roll around with that tooly and my shawty, she be a coolie
And I dress her up in that Gucci but I'm never eating her coochie
No, no way
No, no way

[Verse 1]
I'm drinking rum and Red Bull
And the ammy in my zoot makes me forgetful
I won't remember your name, and I'm not to blame
And these niggas wanna try me and that drives me insane
That means it's tracksuit and it's joggers time
That's the bottom line
Now I'm the one that they wanna find
I'm in the 15, you ain't one of mine
I need a homegirl for the summertime
Yeah, my homeboy is a fan of mine
He's a homeboy, he don't wanna grind
Make him boogie out like it's hammer time

[Bridge]
When I draw for the, draw for the boom boom boom
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody say-ay-ay
Man'll withdraw the ting and clap man with it
If Hus didn't bang off, then Axeman did it

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
Why I roll around with that tooly and my shawty, she be a coolie
And I dress her up in that Gucci but I'm never eating her coochie
No, no way
No, no way

[Verse 2]
Jollof rice on the dinner table, 9 stays right beside it
Feds banging off the door and I'm tryna hide it
Riding now, don't make Ps
But I'm pissed off as man banged off my main squeeze
Stay with my cool, but I still pray to God
You wanna ride on me, you better weigh the odds
I be in the Astra, dotty in the Merc
My plug owes me Ps if this shotty doesn't work

[Bridge]
When I draw for the, draw for the boom boom boom
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody say-ay-ay
Man'll withdraw the ting and clap man with it
If Hus didn't bang off, then Axeman did it

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
They don't know, they don't know
Why I roll around with that tooly and my shawty, she be a coolie
And I dress her up in that Gucci but I'm never eating her coochie
No, no way
No, no way

[Bridge]
When I draw for the, draw for the boom boom boom
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody say-ay-ay
Man'll withdraw the ting and clap man with it
If Hus didn't bang off, then Axeman did it
