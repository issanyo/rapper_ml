[Intro]
Liar
Liar

[Bridge: MoStack]
Claimin' that you're a Gyalist
Claimin' that you're a gangster
Claimin' you gon' rob me
Claimin' that you're a Trapstar
Claimin' that you gon' shoot man
Claimin' that you gon' stab man
Stop it, you ain't a bad man

[Hook: MoStack]
Blud you're a li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)

[Verse 1: Krept]
Tally
Keep up with the lies, fam it's hard for them (Hard for them)
You're not lying, say Wallahi then (Liar)
Them man lying, say their team went and bought sticks
About arsenals, your team never bought shit
It's not by force, be a goon (Be a goon)
‘Cause there's no turning back when it booms (Boom)
You got caught dabbing in a rave (Whatever)
Now the doctors are dabbing on your wounds
Everybody is a G till the war spreads
And the arms on your face, call him Ahmed
Mi no wan' stress, I'd rather a bad B
Feel my D in her abs, call me Abdi
When the brain's shit, what the fuck's this?
So much uck, you would tink I'm from Uxbridge
Self-made, I eat Thai in tuxes
Stop lying, you ain't hustlers

[Verse 2: Konan]
Don't let these wimps near me
Liar, liar, Jim Carrey
When it's on, they just run and hide
'Bout .45s, swear on your mother's life
Skrr, skrr when I'm in a coupe
My young G, bring the beef to your door like Deliveroo
So don't get smart
If, if they find out that Mark's got the belly, they'll stretch Mark
If, if there's a problem, lemme know
I need a bad ting like Demi Rose
I saw your chick in Nandos
Now she tryna Periscope
She wanna come back, late night ting (Late night ting)
Better put your phone on silent (Silent)
She said she never did this before
Stop lying, stop lying (Stop lying, stop lying)

[Bridge: MoStack]
Claimin' that you're a Gyalist
Claimin' that you're a gangster
Claimin' you gon' rob me
Claimin' that you're a Trapstar
Claimin' that you gon' shoot man
Claimin' that you gon' stab man
Stop it, you ain't a bad man

[Hook: MoStack]
Blud you're a li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)
Li-li-li-li-liar (Liar)

[Verse 3: J Hus]
(Awhh my)
All night camper
Sweetcorn for a pretender
Might hit a bystander, last man standing
You're not understanding, last car got abandoned
Pull up in something that's not regular
Three man in the back, there's no leg room, nah (Nah)
Buj man wanna gossip and spread rumour (Why?)
I don't talk about beef when I'm next to her (Fair fight)
You pop guns, sell bricks and you're no good (Is it?)
Put work in the streets and you're so hood (Okay)
Yeah right, all of that sounds good (What?)
But why you not allowed back in your own hood?
Somebody's lying
Catch you red-handed and you're still lying
Lying, lying (Lying, lying)
Can't mix sheep with lions

[Verse 4: MoStack & J Hus]
Bitches, all I hear is they keep bitching
Sideman, pick a side, man, stop switching
What is this? These niggas got me on the hit list
I'm laughing, the only time they have me in stitches
I got a phone call, my paigon got touched
I weren't at the crime scene, I was in the hot tubs
Having a hot rub, you drop bangers, man it's hot stuff
Now that's a lie, ‘cause you're not us
That was cheeky, she sucked my dick
While she tickled my balls, ooh la la, that was freaky
I didn't say I didn't like it though
You're looking like your bro, go buy a Lyca bro
Just trap hard, lick them shots like you're Lampard
Trap yard, turn it mad, I'm the landlord
Fiver, sell fives, you're just a minor
Liar, fake brudda in the designer
Them man lie through their teeth
Take man's grub, I can't lie, I'm a teef
Them man don't hit the trap and get cheese
You're a rat, you don't flip and stack, you're just chief
You're lying, it's written all over
You ain't the gyaldem sugar, you're the gyaldem chauffeur
You're the gyaldem's joker
She's sitting on your face, you're the gyaldem's sofa
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)

[Outro]
Liar, liar, liar
