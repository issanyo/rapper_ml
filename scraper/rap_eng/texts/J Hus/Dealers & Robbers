[Verse 1: MoStack]
Came with the guys
Drugger dealers and robberers by my side
How many times have you lock off inna dance?
Came through, grab a likkle gyal, then we're gone
Came like a militant, balling with some immigrants
If they get in trouble, they get sent back at yard
Man, the whole squad wanna come
But how we gonna fit the whole gang inna the car? Rah

[Verse 2: J Hus & MoStack]
Probably fit the whole gang in the G wagon
From a likkle G, I knew I would be something
If they don't ride for me, then I'll ride by myself
You can lie to me, you can't lie to yourself
Think I'm a rapper, come with the pepper
Banging forever, I've got nuttin' for a heffer
Eskimo jacket, I've got something for the weather
Something in the jacket courtesy of this leather
I step through in the camouflage
Turkish gyal says she wanna buy a lahmacun
Irish gyal at the caravan
I've got gyal everywhere like a traveller
Shit, I just hopped out of the G wagon
I was broke back in day so I keep bragging
Money turned me to a drastic man
Money cyan't fit in an elastic band

[Chorus: MoStack]
I told her she can look but not touch, but she's looking too much
How's she know that my fly is undone?
Niggas keep talking too much, they ain't walking too much
I won't kill them, I'll hire someone
I chill with drugger dealers and burglars
Real badderman since toddler
Risky, I chill with drugger dealers and robberers
Real badderman since toddlers, toddlers

[Verse 3: J Hus]
I thought they was done but they're talking again
Blast at a man when man rassing a skeng
Look, I am tryna be a good guy
Why oh why they gotta make it hard for a man?
They wanna target a man, don't understand
Abnormal like I've got ma arm in ma hand
Dem baby boy wanna jump out the pram
Best stay in your buggy 'fore I jump out with jam

[Verse 4: MoStack]
I had something on my waist
And she felt it
She always falls for a thug, she can't help it
She can't help it, help it, help it
And when she tells me smoke something, man ah start up
She seen the glasses and thought I was a smart-arse
Probably fit the whole gang inna di smart car
Probably fit the whole gang inna di smart car

[Chorus: MoStack]
I told her she can look but not touch, but she's looking too much
How's she know that my fly is undone?
Niggas keep talking too much, they ain't walking too much
I won't kill them, I'll hire someone
I chill with drugger dealers and burglars
Real badderman since toddler
Risky, I chill with drugger dealers and robberers
Real badderman since toddlers, toddlers

[Chorus: MoStack]
I told her she can look but not touch, but she's looking too much
How's she know that my fly is undone?
Niggas keep talking too much, they ain't walking too much
I won't kill them, I'll hire someone
I chill with drugger dealers and burglars
Real badderman since toddler
Risky, I chill with drugger dealers and robberers
Real badderman since toddlers, toddlers

[Outro: MoStack]
Real badderman since toddler, toddlers
Real badderman since toddlers
I chill with drugger dealers and regulars
Yeah, I chill with drugger dealers and robberers
Real badderman since toddlers
