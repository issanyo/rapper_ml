[Intro]
Did you see what..?
Did you see what..?
Did you see what I done? (Yeah)
Did you see what..?
Did yah
Did you see what..?
Did yah did yah see
Did you see what..?
Did you see what I done? (yeah yeah)
Did you see what I done? (Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with the bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done, I done, I done)
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done)
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one

[Verse 1]
Came looking like a ganja farmer
Your daddy better hide his daughter
Shake her bunda just like I taught her
Splashed her bunda with holy water
Lickle spice for the winter season
Your chicken needs a lickle season (Yeah)
Did you see what he did?
The black Benz turn white and they can't believe it
Make 'em repeat it
That's some new ***, they've never seen it
You should feel it, meet and greet it
I would be a genius if I didn't think with my ***
Gyaldem thinkin' I'm awesome
Mandem approach with caution
True say we came with the bonsam
But true say we came for the bunda
Some round ting that I can put my paws on

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with the bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done, I done, I done)
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done)
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one

[Verse 2]
Came smellin' like I've ***
Lookin' for the baddest diva
Hol' up, let me analyse her, *** lookin' like a hypnotiser
Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on
Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from?
Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one
I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic
Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic
They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket
That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder
Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana
Don't you wanna see the interior?

[Chorus]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with the bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done, I done, I done)
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done)
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one

[Outro]
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with the bonsam
When *** wanna try somethin'
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done, I done, I done)
Did you see what I done? (I done, I done, I done, I done)
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
