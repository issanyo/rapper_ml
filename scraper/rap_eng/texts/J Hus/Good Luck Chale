[Intro: Tiggs Da Author]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: J Hus & Tiggs Da Author]
Heard they want me dead, heard they want my bread
Good luck chale, good luck chale
Nuttin' for the police, tryna find out who got me, oh
Good luck chale, good luck chale

[Verse 1: J Hus]
You can tell by the look in his eye, you can't trust him
I whip my menacing eye at a buff ting
My brudda got a sentence, came out bolo and Muslim
Now every sentence starts with "are you listening?"
Check this ting? I done the sick ting
All guns blazing, amazing
Boydem lurking, oh you just missed him
Somewhere in the village with old school ritual man with wisdom
Came back fresher, no pressure, mypleasure
Leng man cold, Juju J all up in your boat
I might of slipped up like oopsie daisy, I mean niggas get popped everyday B
I am in aunties yard with the crooks
The money makes up for the looks
Death coming, I ain't sticking to the deadline
Tell them boys better luck next time

[Chorus: J Hus & Tiggs Da Author]
Heard they want me dead, heard they want my bread
Good luck chale, good luck chale
Nuttin' for the police, tryna find out who got me, oh
Good luck chale, good luck chale

[Verse 2: J Hus]
I'm in aunty's yard with the mafia
You ain't real you can't munch no jollof with us
I know my nigga P planning something devious
And the other P looking like a walking VVS
We made the real funds, them man are just some funny niggas
A couple real dons, why would I need twenty niggas?
These days ten niggas is way too many niggas
Anyway lets forget them any niggas
I was in the can writing letters to Francine
Probably spent a rack on my canteen
Done like four months, it weren't a major thing
The day I came out, Cruddy went straight back in
Now I'm in aunty's yard with the crooks again
They don't know how to behave, just look at them?
I got a hundred opps and I don't think much of them
Still tryna do me so good luck to them

[Bridge: Tiggs Da Author]
Ah yeah, I tell you my story
You think I'm crazy, baby don't worry
I've seen friends that turn to snakes
I've see real ones acting fake
If you think you get me yeah
Good luck Chale
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Tiggs Da Author]
Heard they want me dead, heard they want my bread
Good luck chale, good luck chale
Nuttin' for the police, tryna find out who got me, oh
Good luck chale, good luck chale
Heard they want me dead, heard they want my bread
Good luck chale, good luck chale
Nuttin' for the police, tryna find out who got me, oh
Good luck chale, good luck chale
