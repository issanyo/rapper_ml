[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Chorus]
Comin' like the military
A thousand bells, comin' like the tooth fairy
See you getting clapped up, I'm coming like a visionary
Pole lookin' Bloody Mary, hittin' anybody near me
My own friends movin' weary
Reckless, reckless
Aggressive, aggressive
Reckless, reckless, please don't vex us
Reckless, reckless, delete all my texts
Reckless, reckless, uh

[Verse 1]
Gyal wan' sex us, you know what sex is?
Reckless, reckless
Grab her by the necklace
So much neck, gyal gon' need a neck brace
Gyal saw my bracelet, now she wanna embrace me
I just fuck face, then touch base
I'm gettin' wrapped in the trenches in a rush
Come back to my senses when I buss
Pray my niggas buss case
I got guys doin' bootings with a hot face
They're the reason why your estate is not safe
Two man clippin' with a clipper then they part ways
When they die, they gon' reside in a hot place
How this beef even start in the first place

Reckless, reckless
Aggressive, aggressive
Reckless, reckless, please don't vex us
