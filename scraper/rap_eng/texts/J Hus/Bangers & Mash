[Chorus: J Hus]
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Turn a boy H2O
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Love me some bangers and mash
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water

[Verse 1: J Hus]
It's like you never knew me
Pull up in a black tracksuit looking spooky
You've got your eyes on the best
Mr Ugly, live in the flesh
I come through looking like none of you
Tell them niggas suck your dad like your mumma do
Splash man's face when I'm champagne popping
Splash man's face just for watching
J Hus get dirty
And dem gyal a get flirty
That's my shawty, yes indeed
My brown-skinned babe from the West Indies
But Deepee told me don't wife that
He said "your booboo, she's on my man"

[Chorus: J Hus]
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Turn a boy H2O
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Love me some bangers and mash
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water

[Verse 2: Deepee]
Boom, bangers, mash, rice
Young but I've rised up, hammer's man's size
Bands made me handsome, hammer-slash-nice
And that gyal a handful, hand a man slice
And I got a handful of niggas outside
Put a hand on my friend, handle's in the right
Cuh dem boy paigon, I don't like
I don't trust nobody, that's what man's like
They wanna roll on me, told donny that he's smoking the la-la
They rock it, I got it so I'm with the drama
A karma but pressure pushes palaver
I come round, let it la-la-la-la-la
I come through looking like me
True, I do raps, you wanna do me
I've done moves where man a move each
Mother knew when man are too street

[Chorus: J Hus]
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Turn a boy H2O
My niggas love champers and cash
I need a white girl, I love me some bangers and mash
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Turn a boy H2O
Bangers and mash, bangers and mash
Love me some bangers and mash
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water
Big sticks in a man's face
Boom boom, turn a man water

[Verse 3: J Hus]
I step in the scene on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if I don't know no one
I've got a ram who's looking oh so glum
Talk about my squad? You better hold your tongue
They don't wanna see me blow
Cause I'll fill up my block with turners
Three booters in the road
They didn't hit no one 'cause they're missing on purpose
White girl Carolina
She be in the joob with tanitas
She loves them ride-outs and them beaches
Can't forget my white girl Davina
You be looking cruddy in your black dress
Double barrel under the mattress
Turn your mandem to ash
My booboo cooking bangers and mash
