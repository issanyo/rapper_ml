BEAT 1

J Hus
Hustla Baby
You are now listening to the talk of the town
Butch fresh home
Free P
Get me
Let's go

These roads ain't safe, that's why my Mummy pray for me
That's why my tool always stays with me
Tell a fuck boy, stay away from me
A these n*ggas, and these n*ggas wanna play with me
Why you gotta do that?
Like you never knew that
Man a go there and leave him slumped like 2Pac
They wanna see me lose my cool
Lord forgive me if I use my tool
Lord forgive me if I lose my senses
So many pagans I don't know who my friend is
Too many man wish death pon me
So I don't trust no n*ggas except from me
I can tell you bout them crime scenes
I don't only rap on beats
Ask man be a burner boy
He don't do no afrobeats
That's my brother
Nine bags for the Rollie
All these slags them a phoney
Cos of rap they wanna know me
Tell her no strings
Cos I can't hold down no wife
I'll be grafting posted on the corner like a low life
They don't wanna grind
They gon grow up to be dickheads
Me, I'm up and down
There's no rest for the wick-ed
Shoulda stayed low key and not caused all the trouble
Now n*ggas getting robbed, they ain't supporting the hustle
My link gave me Zs and if I don't make prof
Imma go back and leave the whole scene taped off
Broke on a Monday, copped a Z on the Tuesday
That shit was gone by the Wednesday
Robbed my connect on the Thursday
Flood the strip on Friday
Do the same on Saturday
My line jumping by Sunday
I shoulda stayed in Colly
I shoulda went to uni
Getting brains off of Molly
While I'm wiping down my tooly
Baby gyal I love you
Nah, nah, nah that's just the weed talking
My line died, I started grafting now it's respawning
Me and Grumpy munching jollof fries and salad cream
N*ggas wanna challenge me
N*ggas wanna vanish me
I'll slice through, make the 30 go 'boo boo bang'
If I die now, my Mum got bumped by the Juju Man
The beef gets cooking, my n*ggas get live
Copped a big dutty, I'm just tryna survive
I can tell you bout months of grind
What you know bout putting food where the sun don't shine

Weapons got lost the same weapons got rebought
N*gga giving verbal, n*gga let the street talk
My accys don't fuck with no pigs
Cos you can't say As-salamu alaykum and eat pork
Wanna see my brothers ballin
Yaya and Kolo
If they don't grind then Imma roll on my solo
I get the cheapest Zs from my Ghana brother Kojo
They say I fell off but I guess I found my mojo
Me I tell the truth no lies
Tryna turn my trackies into suits and ties
You've been grinding for some weeks and you're still on the same Z
Me and Grumpy cop a 9 bar then we break bread
She calling me handsome, please stop pretending
J Hus butters fam, I never been a peng ting
We used to be doggs, fuck that I refuse to know
Man a poke him up like a voodoo doll
Cos I rap for the gyal wanna watch face
I ain't playing no games if I touch waist
J Hus slash JuJu J, nutcase
Bust gun, bust juj then we bust case
Uuh!

INTERLUDE
Bear man hating, they don't wanna see me shine
Imma shine regardless
J Hus, next up, next beat

BEAT 2

J Hus
East London's ugliest
Hustla Baby!
Uh!

Where do I start from
Jakes in my Marge rum
Tryna get my paws on, any type of large funds
People took the flicky but Hus took the large one
People took the flicky J Hus took the large one
Damn! I took one for the team
Do you know how much shit that we done for the cream
I keep telling myself I gotta jump on the dean
Meanwhile I'm tryna leave a n*gga slumped on the scene
Bless all my n*ggas with peace and salam
Still gotta roll with the heat in the palm
My part East isn't calm
Ask man broad day beat and they calm
Yo my n*ggas ain't phoney crooks they'll blaze if they nervous
They don't know holy books or places of worship
Money, burners, we grind for a reason
Out here for a purpose, out here for a purpose
One day I'll leave this whole life and jump on the dean
But I'm stuck in the scene that corrupted my dreams
I constructed a team
No one round me's bummy
My brothers trapping six ways well rowdy and scummy
I was up and down, you only found me with Grumpy
I'm just pissed my connect never found me the pumpy
Jallow be a nice guy, yeah he might act savage
End up in the court full of white lies and black magic
My soul be filthy and dark
I might bust case but I'm as guilty as charged
And if Mum knew, all the stuff I do she'd have a heart attack
If I lose it all I'll cop a Q, then I'll start from scratch
I was born in era, causing terror
As long as there's beef I'm with my sword forever
I ain't rich yet, but Imma stay patient
I made the whole hood say, 'I need a vacation'
Stuck in the ends, lost a lot of friends
Still some n*ggas that I gotta make my shank dance for
I still boogie with the Devil on the dance floor
Still out here with the rebels and the outlaws
Money on the table
Investments are pistols or pumpies
Ride house it was me, Pizol and Grumpy
Nowadays I party up in Bristol and Pumpy, Bristol and Pumpy
All the Ps that I lost was a piss take
Fake friends I used to trust, mistake
I can't tell you bout a kiss or a cuddle
But I'll tell you bout the shit that I risk for the hustle
Came back from Bris with the newest parcel
My n*ggas got the piss like a urine sample
You think for the Ps he won't clap your dome
You think he won't uyyyhhggg like snap capone
We grind hard in the East End
No part time shit, I'm in the deep end
Graveyards shifts, the hours were peak
No showers, no sleep, devour the streets
I came from the dirt, hustlings the only way
The devil took my soul away
All Mummy does is hope and pray
I'm sorry that I let you down
Might not make it home today
Listening to bills or its miles on the motorway
I was with the accys in the kitchen like a yardie chef
On the grind all day and we hardly slept
And these girls don't lie cos they used to give line ups
And now they tryna get us lined up
But I can never get sarped by a bukie yat
Tryna tempt me with her tits but I ain't falling for no boobie traps

Ayyyy listen, the beef gets cooking
