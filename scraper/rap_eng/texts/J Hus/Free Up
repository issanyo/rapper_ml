[Verse 1]
Your ex couldn't treat you proper
But he didn't know no better
That's  why i stroke it better
'Cause ones mans trash is another mans treasure
We could of made all the moneys together
But you can't mix up the business with pleasure
Mami I'm a different fella
And i see the difference in her
Niggas travel distance for her

[Pre-Hook]
Hood princess your body looking interesting
She standing still but her arse shaking
Mi never knew you could do dem tings
I just sit back and view dem tings like
Who taught you dem tings?
Baby girl Ur talking my language

Now she wanna make me a sandwich

[Hook]

You need to free up the free up

[Verse 2]

Oh don't you get shy with me
Keep rolling it nice with me
Oh don't roll your eyes at me
Attitude girl, island girl
I just wanna feel you
Lemme see the real you
Tell me whats the deal boo?

Shake your bundah
If your daddy saw this he would kill you
But i'm your daddy right now
Shake your body right now
She put it on me right now
Do it for me right now
Your bundah looking like what did you eat
You make me haffi grab it up in da middle of the street
And you've been so stubborn recently
Rude gyal don't kiss your teeth at me
Like you want a piece of me
You wind me up easily

[Hook]
