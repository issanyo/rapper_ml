[Intro]
J Hus
Hustler baby

[Hook]
Baby girl come through
Show me what that tongue do
I won’t tell nobody baby girl I won’t judge you
Take it slow, tek your time, tek your time
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well

[Verse 1]
Yo I know this one hottie, She be from Totty
Real classy, she ain’t nuttin' like a thotty
She my north girl and I be telling her to fly down
Come Stratford baby, that’s my town
She talking dirty, Show me what you’re made of
Do it like a porn star, I ain’t tryna make love
No strings attached I just wanna sex and chill
Your soft lips and long tongue, crazy sex appeal
The old sex I was having made me vexed for real
She told me all her secrets, she knows that I can keep it
But I don’t ever open up these girls aren’t trustworthy
Fuck love all I love is that ya fuck curvy
Yo darling, know u hear me calling
Can’t let her pass me
Baby girl classy, body looking trendy
Everything trendy, everytin' everytin' trendy yo

[Chorus]
Baby girl come through
Show me what that tongue do
I won’t tell nobody baby girl I won’t judge you
Take it slow, tek your time, tek your time
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well

[Verse 2]
Kicking back listening to Ashanti
But when it’s that time I don’t say a word
I give her that look like
Tek off ya panty, tek off ya panty, tek off ya panty
Yeah she kinda feisty
Only a rude girl can really satisfy me
This ain’t puppy love no were past that stage
Speaking with my lingo, she love my catchphrase
Hustler baby, Shorty what ya telling me?
She wan ride on me like my enemy
I’m a breast man but I rate arses
I ain’t Giggs, I wrap it up I don’t take chances
She loves it when I call her my brown skin shawty
Stoosh for them boys but for me she get naughty
Don’t need juana, don’t need no Anita
Right now I got me a bad mamacita

[Hook]
Baby girl come through
Show me what that tongue do
I won’t tell nobody baby girl I won’t judge you
Take it slow, tek your time, tek your time
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well
She doing it and doing it and doing it well
Doing it and doing it and doing it well

[Bridge]
Yo darling, know u hear me calling
Can’t let her pass me
Baby girl classy, Body looking deadly
Everytin trendy, everytin everytin trendy yo
Yo darling, know u hear me calling
Can’t let her pass me
Baby girl classy, body looking deadly
Everytin trendy, everytin everytin trendy yo
