[Intro: J Hus]
Hustler, baby
JOAT

[Hook: J Hus]
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
Drive me, drive me up the wall

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Dem boy pretty, J Hus gruesome
Dem boy bowcat, I could never two's them
What's that smell? I think I smell bacon
You weren't in them cabbies, you was banging on them pagans
My don grips the strally, these Glock sticks I carry
I couldn't give a damn about no Tom, Dick or Harry
Ayesha with the batty, that's one chick I'd marry
Hit it from the back and tell her "cum quick for daddy"
You ain't been about if you ain't heard of my niggas
I'll never spill beans, I'll ride a bird for my niggas
And if that chick ugly, ugly like me
I'll take one for the team and ride that bird for my niggas
Looking for me? I ain't hard to find
My niggas ride out just to pass the time
Now my new ting bugging me cause I forgot to call
Babygirl, you know you drive me up the wall

[Hook: J Hus X2]
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
Drive me, drive me up the wall


[Verse 2: Fekky]
These niggas know my pattern
Fuck a bandwagon, I'll just bang at 'em, damn cannon
Fake friend and backstabber, dough-grabber
I bogle with my strap like Shabba
Capital F, I'm a capital G
I dare a motherfucker try and slap it on me
I'm a bad boy, I'll clap it in a batty boy's knee
I walk in that dance with that ratchet on me
Niggas phone my phone, you don't get no answer
You don't eat, no rice, no pasta
Don't lie, no jokes, no banter
Half my niggas in the can like Fanta
Real nigga, yeah, I'm really certified
Yeah, only rolling round with certain guys
What's all the talk? You ain't about that life
I've got that big MAC for these small fry

[Hook: J Hus X2]
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
And these niggas drive me up the wall
Drive me, drive me up the wall
