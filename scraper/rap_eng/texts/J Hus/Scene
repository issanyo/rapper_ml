[Verse 1]
In and out of rentals
Two bedroom apartment
2-2 jibs on my expensive garment
Keep a stick in the uni boy's basement
Any altercation
Business 'ffiliation
Money conversation
Build a foundation
This ain't no street gang, bitch this a mafia
Linking up in traffic with a drug trafficker
Mash in the car cause a massacre

[Hook]
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem

[Verse 2]
JuJu J in your face
Touching my waist
Spray up the place
And spray again just in case
Tried to play nice guy, that shit don't work
Mashing work
The mash works
Had to go berserk
Had to divert
I rob and I jerk
I camp and I lurk
Linked up with the Turks
Get merked from the Merc
If I reach in my pouch I'm on dirts
His last words were, "ouch that hurts"
You can't relate I'm talking broad day bait
One man escaped then we blammed up his mate
Straight
All the bread I had to break for my bredrin's sake
All my niggas in the can I just pray and I wait
Had a dream that my nigga, Pitch broke out
Girl get dicked down and get choked out
Keep screwing 'till your eyes get poked out

[Hook]
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem

[Verse 3]
Twenty bells, twenty bells, twenty bells when we drift by
The specs are a disguise
I don't like this guy
I closing my left eye
They think I'm winking but I'm aiming
Block invasion
I don't say Nathan
They making allegations
My creps alligator
No explanation for my bad behaviour
Your whole bloke baking, find a block that's safer
What's a reputation? Wig him in the elevator (fuck your rep)
Pure greaze coming through your speaker
I'm a clapper not a speaker
Ashed out my zoot with my Valentino sneaker
Local slanger
Neighbourhood dealer
E15 banger
Me and shank man, creeper
It only gets deeper
I'm a Laker
You're a leaker
How you make a song with a opps and ask me for a feature?
Look at this opper
Look at this creature
Imma do it proper
Somebody had to teach her

[Bridge]
This whole year is pull up season
Every disco, every fashion show, every barbecue we deyah
We taking all their food, in fact they are the food
Feed them to the fucking hyenas

[Hook]
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem
Don't make me cause a scene
Rudeboy, I'll clap you in your bean
Get away, get away clean
Long time, where you been?
I've been tryna find the machine
Everything ain't really what it seem

[Outro]
Don't make me cause a scene
Don't make me cause a scene
Don't make me cause a scene
Don't make me cause a scene
