[Chorus]
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering

[Verse 1]
You don't get gyal, fam you're bluffin'
Got gyal from Stratford to Dublin
Got gyal from overseas travellin'
Bring Creeper in with her cousin
Confidence when I'm boppin'
Two compliments had her blushin'
2 2 strokes had her bussin'
You're not my only gyal, I got options
Bein' broke ain't no option
See the whip I just hopped in
See the gyal that just hopped in
Say she don't do this often
Same thing she said to my bredrin
Can you imagine?
But do your thing, I ain't judgin'
Mash it up and start dashin'

[Chorus]
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering

[Verse 2]
Get dough like we're obligated
Dem man discombobulated
That's big boy grammar
Came with a big boy blammer
Then shake hands with a kidnapper
Might take the gang Ayia Napa
We used to laugh when we was bruk
You ain't laughin', now what's the matter?
16 plate, E15 on the plate, wait
Pull up in the Porsche
Creepers with me of course
The rest of the mandem in the caf√©
"Pass me the tomato sauce"
Only five man, but I'm rollin' with a genuine clique
Thought I woulda never of been shit
Then I gave the waiter a generous, generous tip

[Chorus]
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering
Don't think I'm shy 'cause I'm quiet
I'm just plottin', I'm plottin'
I got dem where I want dem
Still on tings if you're wondering
