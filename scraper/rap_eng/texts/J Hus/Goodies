[Intro]
Yo, hustler man
It's your boy man, long time no see man?
Where you been, man? You been ghostin' init? Hahahaha
Ah, it's nice to see you man
You know just the other day I was with Curtis and them boys there you know
They was talking about you
They say you be hiding, they looking for you, they wanna do you, you know
I don't know man, I'm just, I'm just the messenger you know
Yeah, listen, yeah

[Verse 1]
I want all the monies, nigga I'm selfish
My niggas sell fish with Hermes on their pelvis
This ain't no Tilapia, offset with mafia
Grafter no partier, born chasin' mafia
Money make me happier, stoosh gyal get nastier
Act like you're nicer, roadman but I'm classier
Bang from the passenger, I shoot the messenger
Previous offender on the run, no surrender
Fuck goin' Heaven with the goody, goodies
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
I'm no good, I steal candy from a fuckin' baby
Plus I read my future from a fortune cookie
My lifestyle's a dirty one, bang 'til I'm 31
Broad day bootin', anythin' movin'
Council housin', still rob Balmain
Big fast scram, make a public announcement

[Chorus]
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
It's a stick up, I want all
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
Bang from the passenger, I shoot the messenger

[Verse 2]
How we gon' maintain? Born in the fast lane
Where your best friend would probably shoot you then snitch on you
Where you own flesh and blood would put a hit on you
Dutty gyal, I ain't tryna hit on you
Mum thought I was a miracle, turned out horrible, lifestyle terrible
The whopper does what I say 'cause it's gullible
Turn man invisible, Biskit comes with every syllable
Swimmin' in a puddle
Your mum told you don't hang with me 'cause I'm trouble
The bonsam jumbo, get it done pronto
Splash the whole front row, I'm just makin' convo
(Hi Sir, how are you?)
I wanna ride out and cash out and all 'dem tings
The opps stay runnin' up their gums, I don't know right from wrong
Now I've gotta buss off my, what do you call 'dem tings?

[Chorus]
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
It's a stick up, I want all
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
Bang from the passenger, I shoot the messenger
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
It's a stick up, I want all
It's a stick up, I want all the goodies
Bang from the passenger, I shoot the messenger
