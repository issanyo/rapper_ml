[Verse 1: J Hus]
I don't want one wife, I want three of them
Girl I only love you at 3am
Callin' your line like it's me again
When your man not around I can be your friend
All I know is boy can't wait
I can't love ya, girl, I love cake
You think it's love then it's my mistake
You know my style
And I'm still out here, runnin' wild

[Hook: Giorgia Lo]
Boy
It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Boy
It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Post-Hook: J Hus]
Girl
I seem to love you now
But it's only for a while
Playboy smile
Then I threw in the towel
And you fell for me
You thinkin' it's somethin' but really it's nothin'
I'm really a wrongun, I'm feelin' your cousin
Before I cuff you, they'll put me in cuff and
I'm livin, I'm hustlin'
I'm runnin' through the city, be mumblin'

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Jumped out the hooptie to the Benz
Poof and disappear, and then we explore your ends
We was right there, posted outside of Burger King
When you went and told your friend that you're feelin' me
In the bed if I used my front would you like that?
You be waitin' on a freak to come try that
But listen, no I can't afford to get sidetracked
All I ever do is count racks, rockin' wave caps

[Hook: Giorgia Lo]
Boy
It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Boy
It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
