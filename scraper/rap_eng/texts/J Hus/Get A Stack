[Hook: J Hus]
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt

[Verse 1: Krept]
Man call me Matt, bros call be Akh
Said I'll never blow now I'm blowing out a back
Fuck her on the sink, I got pussy on tap
White girl said it's big, is it 'cause I'm black?
Heard man rap but it weren't facts
Talking online but you didn't act
Phone Sammy Max, everybody get back
Big hand ting, rat-a-tat-tat
Bro don't chat, ready with the wap
South of the map, city on our back
Girl said I'm buff even though I'm clapped
It must've been that hundred K plus VAT
Flex in the South, flex in the East
Man got the sauce, come flex with the G's
Man better stay clear, the feds drive me crazy
This is Krept, Konan, Hustler baby

[Hook: J Hus]
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt

[Verse 2: Konan]
Her pum pum fat, she showed me on Snap
On my WhatsApp, little leg tap
Saw him in real life, he said it weren't that
Ak got the butcher, pockets get pat
Had the dinger on lap, nearly shot skat
Ringer all white, bali all black
And when I pay tax, that's your whole stack
That's your new car, that's your whole flat
Tell me why ain't they rich? Talking 'bout bricks
Look at their kicks, don't take the piss
Rollie on wrist, looking all Swiss
Left with a brown ting, looking all crisp
She got work in the morning but she wanna come with me
I see your bredrin's calling but she wanna come with me

[Hook: J Hus]
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
If you see the back, I'm a pimp and a mutt

[Outro: J Hus]
Had to sell a pack, tryna get a stack
See the rucksack, get a boy whack
See the gal there, looking like a snack
