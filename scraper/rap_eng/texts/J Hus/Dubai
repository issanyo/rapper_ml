[Hook: J Hus]
You might see me in the village
You might see me in Dubai
I should've went to probation
But I got too high

[Verse 1: J Hus]
I told my booboo come roll one
And then we inhaled the dank-o
Cause she been juuging all day
Like Griselda Blanco
Tryna make a mill, you won't see me in the shubs
You might see me in the ville, you might see me in the Dubs
More time they can't pass the fifteen barrier
All we fear is God and a 16 carrier

[Refrain: J Hus]
You know that feeling when life's so good, life's so good?
Make you say bumbaclart chale, bumbaclart chale, bumbaclart chale
You know that feeling when life's so good, life's so good?
Make you say bumbaclart chale, bumbaclart chale, bumbaclart chale

[Hook: J Hus]
You might see me in the village
You might see me in Dubai
I should've went to probation
But I got too high

[Verse 2: Locz]
They say they know me but they don't know this life
I roll around with my wifey as my stick on my side
Bad B give me eye, she give me naughty eye
And I ain't ever told a lie on the words I write
And I ain't ever in Dubai, I'm in the village
Possessing something lethal with my hitters
If the beef gets cooking, I ain't gotta get vocal
And if you see blue tape, you know it was local

[Verse 3: J Hus]
And I could never be friends with them
Bare shots, I'mma send for them
Said I got one shot and I'mma take it
Cause I'm just tryna make it
But they will never understand
How I like the
Finer things in life for my baby
Like diamond rings and ice

[Hook: J Hus]
You might see me in the village
You might see me in Dubai
I should've went to probation
But I got too high

[Verse 4: Locz]
Rolling through the hood in my shades
From young, they've been telling me I'm big for my age
But I ain't too big for this gauge
Black balaclava, you don't wanna slip like
I just wanna trap and she just wanna trap me
And she gon' eat this wood if she a bad B
I give her naughty eye, she make me happy
But I ain't tryna be her baby daddy

[Hook: J Hus]
You might see me in the village
You might see me in Dubai
I should've went to probation
But I got too high
