[Intro: Lady Leshurr]
Look lukatar look lukatar
Look lukatar look lukatar

[Verse 1: Scratchy]
Scratchy's about look at him look at him
Big hair don't care never look a trim
Whatever I wear I still look alright (look alright)
From the outside view looking in (book a flight)
Look at this look at that
Look at me looking mad
So many lookalikes look like scratch
Look at her looking at me looking mad

[Verse 2: Frisco]
And they be like look at her look at her
Bare funny looks dem gyal wanna put on her
Pissed off true say they can't keep up
And they aren't looking at you like leshurr
I wouldn't poop on her much Less look at her lukatar
Lukatar avatar
And you already know my ting rude boi if a man try me i won't have a bar Sky

[Hook: Lady Leshurr]
Every where I go they be like look at her
When I do a show they be like look at her
Checking out my clothes they be like look at her
Look at her look at the lo
Everywhere I go they be like look at her
When I do a show the be like look at her
Checking out my clothes they be like look at her
Look at her look at her lo

[Verse 3: Flirta D]
This one's a banger and you already know
King Flirta D makes you already know
Rolling like stoners I'm already stoned
I'm Diddy Diddy bad but I'm really a pro
You're siddy diddy sad cuz your swags ghost
Look at him look at look at him flow
Watch how you look at him look at him though
And watch how you look at her look at her though

[Verse 4: God's Gift]
That girls peng (lukatar)
I can tell she ain't from the endz (lukatar)
And you can tell she is intelligent (lukatar)
I like the lioness dress sense (lukatar)
And I'm even feeling her friends (lukatar)
She would get the walalang next (lukatar)
Most peng gyal have got a dead cockblock friend but she ain't even got one them (lukatar)

[Verse 5: J Hus]
Look at her (ooh my)
I got my eyes on you
You got my head sweating and my boxers rising too
Wait hold up this ain't what it seems
That's my fat tooly poking out my jeans

[Verse 6: Bonkaz]
I got a new girl
She don't want a lot
She wanna walk off for me like dollybot
See them man there
They ain't on nothing (nothing)
They don't run nothin (nothing)
They just run a lot
They all talk bad
On the Internet
Don't believe them
It's all bullshit
And they all mad
At how my nigga flex
But when I see them
They all force it (weirdos)

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Jamakabi]
8 bars to look at her
Send for the tall up style no avatar
Leshurr can release the beast with a brudda bars
Me and couple dem from London took it her
Big badge a man can be no amateur
West man and high grade caliber
Flows free a thing from day and are really fast
And a brudda pree me ain't nobody look at her

[Verse 8: Bugzy Malone]
Look at her
Getting about and strutting her stuff like I'm not about
There nothing I can do so I might bounce
Fuck it I can't lie down
I meant to be some kind of a king wearing a crown
But now there's a queen in town
Into the devil I turn
Shut off the music
Still didn't turn round peak

[Verse 9: Grizzy]
Look at you look at you
Never seen you face round here who are you
I put my hand on my heart so jook a man down for the food
Look at him look at her look at you
I can have about 10 gyal in my room (10 gyal in my room)
You ain't been you been about you ain't been about just move
