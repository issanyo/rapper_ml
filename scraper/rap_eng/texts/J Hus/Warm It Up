[Intro]
Early in the morning
JOAT

[Pre-Hook]
Gyal dem lipse and whine
I like the girls with a thick behind
I was thinking 'bout you when I writ this rhyme
If you're looking for a good time then hit my line
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me

[Hook]
Early in the morning
Warm it up for me
I can hear your body calling
Warm it up for me
I ain't tryna make you fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Just warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up for me

[Verse 1]
Donny's all up in my space
I don't know man like that
Yo, I enter the scene, tek any girl that I want
Cause I'm the man like that
Now your man wanna do me
That's when my stick comes in handy
Then I'mma take a trip to you auntie
She's a freaky girl but we could do whatever tickles your fancy

[Pre-Hook]
Gyal dem lipse and whine
I like the girls with a thick behind
I was thinking 'bout you when I writ' this rhyme
If you're looking for a good time then hit my line
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me

[Hook]
Early in the morning
Warm it up for me
I can hear your body calling
Warm it up for me
I ain't tryna make you fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Just warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up for me

[Bridge]
If I give it to you, you gotta give it to me
You could be my trap queen and we be flipping them kis
And if I give it to you, you gotta give it to me
You could be my trap queen and we be flipping them kis
And I'm gonna call you up
Just make sure you're warm enough
However long I take
Trust me, it's worth the wait

[Pre-Hook]
Gyal dem lipse and whine
I like the girls with a thick behind
I was thinking 'bout you when I writ this rhyme
If you're looking for a good time then hit my line
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me
I can't give it to you right now
Warm it up for me

[Hook]
Early in the morning
Warm it up for me
I can hear your body calling
Warm it up for me
I ain't tryna make you fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Just warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up for me

[Hook]
Early in the morning
Warm it up for me
I can hear your body calling
Warm it up for me
I ain't tryna make you fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Just warm it up, warm it up
Warm it up for me

[Outro]
