[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Oh yeah, it's crazy how we blowing

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
I can smell something in the oven
Get it while it's on the zebra crossing
New whip, new chick, superfly
Ain't rapped, shit I want the same line, have you got it?
Said a prayer before I loaded up the session
Said I'm going Hamilton, I'm going Beckham
I was supposed to hit it one time
Told all my niggas I'm going back for seconds
You want a war then I'm ain't holding back my weapon
I thought I told you, I'mma teach you all a lesson
Amateurs try and fuck up the progression
In the end, you gotta suck up to the motherfucking legends
You ain't Dizzee, you ain't Kane, you ain't Mega
Trying to find the Holy Grail, the Holy Mecca
Trying to change the worst for the better
Make a bredda try and take his own life if you let the pressure get ya

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Oh yeah, it's crazy how we blowing

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Trying to get to this money
Baby why do you think I'm up late?
Ooooh
Got these OZs seeling like hotcakes
My hitters hold you for ransom
All they need is rope and the duct tape
You'll be looking at your life
Compare it to mine, now them niggas thinking 'fuck's sake'
Got a bad B that acts cruddy, says she wanna make money
She might just catch body, I just tell her sheg body
The way I beat up the hus, it must be forbidden
If she don't like Hus, then she must like women
Can't put my feet up, I'm not stopping
Overload the clip, then grease up the Dot Rotten
You don't see gwop, I'll rock bottom
Shawty all over me, she wan' crease up my jog bottoms

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Oh yeah, it's crazy how we blowing

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah & *J Hus*]
My agent said
'T why you be on that black shit again?'
Said I'll put out this mixtape for free
So they won't buy your wack shit again
I just followed 50 girls on my Insta
I'm getting distracted again
Chris Brown's here like a Karrueche
Hit her twice, now she's spraying like a uzi
Swimming pools, 20 girls in my Jacuzzi
Naija boy, but these women think I'm Cudi
*I used to have 100 friends*
Why's a 1000 people fronting like they know me?
I fuck with G Frsh, I fuck with J Hus
Only letting real niggas in the Ace club
Cause you couldn't walk a mile in my shoes nigga, settle
I just pray the Lord's with me while I boogie with these devils like brap

[Bridge: J Hus]
I used to have 100 friends
Now I count all my friends on my right hand
How can you be a pagan now
When you could have been my right hand?
Heard they wanna boogie with the boy
Heard they wanna boogie with the boy
So I put on my dancing shoes
Put on my, put on my dancing shoes

[Hook: Tinie Tempah]
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Keep going motherfucker, keep going
Oh yeah, it's crazy how we blowing

[Outro: Tinie Tempah]
Mama done raised me a saint
Strippers done build up my pain
Most of my niggas Havana
Deal with dilemnas like [?]
Pied Piper with the fiddles
Stiff as icicles
Used to ask my mama why Lidls?
You was too shy and civil
New guy up in the palace on my suit and tie shizzle
