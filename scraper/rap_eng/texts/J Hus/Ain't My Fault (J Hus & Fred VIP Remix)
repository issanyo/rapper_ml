[Intro: Zara Larsson]
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone
It ain't my fault I'm not leavin' alone
It ain't my fault you keep turnin' me on

[Verse 2: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
Yeah
Hustler, baby
You sing something (ha ha ha)
Came looking like a rockstar
Leave the club with a popstar
Girl, had to take a second glance
Why you got two left feet?
You can't do my dance (it ain't my fault)
Mash up the dancefloor (it ain't my fault)
Pour this juice on the floor (it ain't my fault)
Have to be an outlaw (it ain't my fault)
You know what, I'm not sure
I fell in love with Zara Larsson
Sorry, beg your pardon
I'm a different kind of person
He's the phony version
She loves my East London accent
I made ugly the new fashion
Cashmere, DaVinci
I don't know how it happened (it ain't my fault)
Mash up the dancefloor (it ain't my fault)
Pour this juice on the floor (it ain't my fault)
Have to be an outlaw (it ain't my fault)
You know what, I'm not sure

[Verse 3: Zara Larsson]
It ain't my fault you came here lookin' like that
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap
Certain bad boy smooth
Body hotter than a summer
I don't mean to be rude, but I'd look so damn good on ya
Ain't got time right now
Missed me with that
"What's your name, your sign" right now
It's light outside
I just called an Uber and it's right outside
Oh my god, what is this?
Want you all in my business
Baby, I insist
Please don't blame me for what ever happens next

[Bridge: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
Mash up the dancefloor (it ain't my fault)
Pour this juice on the floor (it ain't my fault)
Have to be an outlaw (it ain't my fault)
You know what, I'm not sure

[Breakdown: Zara Larsson + J HUS]
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, oh my, ain't my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if, oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, oh my, ain't my
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if
It ain't my fault
(It's not your fault) Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(It's not your fault) Even if I, oh my, ain't my
(It's not your fault)Oh my, oh my, oh my
(I say that) Even if I, even if, oh my, oh my
(It's not your fault) Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(It's not your fault) Even if I, oh my, ain't my
(It's not your fault) Oh my, oh my, oh my
Even if I, even if it ain't my fault

[Bridge: J HUS + Zara Larsson]
(Wait up) Mash up the dancefloor
(Wait up) Pour this juice on the floor
(Wait up) Have to be an outlaw
(Wait up) You know what, I'm not sure (it ain't my fault)
(Wait up) Mash up the dancefloor (it ain't my fault)
(Wait up) Pour this juice on the floor (it ain't my fault)
(Wait up) Have to be an outlaw (it ain't my fault)
You know what, I'm not sure
