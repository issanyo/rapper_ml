Dem a wonder if we do the miracle dem like Christ
Tell dem, a millions inna mi duffle, me a the Bouffy Daddy

Burner deh pon mi belly, so me ever a pree
And anyweh me go, mi say, me have it with me

[Chorus: J Hus]
I know one thing for certain
You better keep your eyes peeled, I'm lurkin'
'Cause I tour the city in an Addison Lee
And if I pull up, then it's curtain
I ain't had a good night sleep since God knows when
Keep your eyes peeled, I'm lurkin'
When you hear the bud line boomin'
You know the money had me ridin' brutal
Now they see me and say "Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy"
Everywhere I go they say "Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy"
In the ends I'm the Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy
Ya dun kno', ya dun kno'

[Verse 2: J Hus]
The mandem got no style
Go check my profile
My lifestyle is so wild
Gyal on my mobile
Gyal from worldwide
Cash in a big pile
Gyal with a cute smile
It's been a long while
Man, I've been hustling
Man flip an onion
Gyal with a nose ring
Gyal with a tongue ring
Big bum bum shaker
I swear she was made for a big money maker
Everything paid for
Dem calling we the Bouff
Tell you the truth
Gyal, I just bouffed
Dawg, I just -
Attack, and I spray
Beef man from back in the day
Man got three wives, the African way (The African way)

[Chorus: J Hus]
I know one thing for certain
You better keep your eyes peeled, I'm lurkin'
'Cause I tour the city in an Addison Lee
And if I pull up, then it's curtain
I ain't had a good night sleep since God knows when
Keep your eyes peeled, I'm lurkin'
When you hear the bud line boomin'
You know the money had me ridin' brutal
Now they see me and say "Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy"
Everywhere I go they say "Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy"
In the ends I'm the Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy
Ya dun kno', ya dun kno'

[Outro: Popcaan]
Tell dem say we a the daddy
Bouff Daddy, mhm hm

Bouff Daddy, Bouff Daddy
Woii yoii
