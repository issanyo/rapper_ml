[Chorus]
Told my nigga put down his balaclava
Would you not rather
Fuck with a posh tata from Upminster?
Her pops a minister, yeah, she's cute but she's so sinister
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her

[Verse 1]
Mashin' up the same ussna for like three weeks
Baby, I'm tired, I can't give you a good fuck
But for sure she gon' let me get a sneak peak
I'm her main screezer, that's my sweet cheeks
Bunda so big it can't fit in the selfie
She loud and boujee, won't shut up her mouth until I fuck up the coochie
Most of pretty gyaldem are mouthy
All up in business she's nosy
Big man like me, I sneak out on the lowkey
Got Creeper waitin' round the corner in the 'uss mobile
Jump in the ride and peel
This nigga can't drive, somebody take the wheel
Tell the bunda squad that we're gonna be late
Me and my nigga goin' on a double date
Why your cup's still full? Nigga, sip up
I need to wake up, rinse my face off with CÃ®roc

[Chorus]
Told my nigga put down his balaclava
Would you not rather
Fuck with a posh tata from Upminster?
Her pops a minister, yeah, she's cute but she's so sinister
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her

[Verse 2]
I like dem gyal with the cute faces
Dem prestige gyal that carry screw faces
Instagram got her feelin' too famous
Every man stare when she tie her shoelaces
She wanna complain, her friends are two-faced
Her mum's a lawyer, my don caught a new case
You think I can trust her? Bring her to my new place?
"Hus you're buggin', you've only known her two days"
Bring your gyal for my bredrin, he only wants the best
Said her friends peng, that's what every girl says
I am about to get loose, fuck what anyone says
Um, she undress to impress
The Henny comes out, then the truth comes outs
Girl, I've been waitin' too long now
Too much loud, I need some new lungs now
Take a friend from me and do man proud

[Chorus]
Told my nigga put down his balaclava
Would you not rather
Fuck with a posh tata from Upminster?
Her pops a minister, yeah, she's cute but she's so sinister
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her
When she give you that look, saying go finish her
Blud, you're moist if you don't finish her
