[Intro]
Oh Man!...
AuhAuhAuh, AuhAuhAuh
JAE5...

[Chorus]
Doing styles on them like it's common sense
Hopped out the Benz like it's common sense
Got a monkey on my feet like it's common sense
Got gorillas in the streets like it's common sense
Stack the money, heads up, like it's second nature
Gotta stay poled up, like it's second nature
Keep a chip in my ear, like it's second nature
Big bunda make me stare, like second nature

[Verse 1]
Zs disappear like second nature
Posted on the same block like an hour later
Whole team eating, but it's only right
There's a spare plate but you're the phony type
"J Hus ugly, innit", baby, one minute
Your bunda looking wicked
Ay-o, I started off gentle
My stroke game mental, my lifestyle eventful
I didn't mean to offend you
Fendi belt saying, "F you," I style like I'm meant to
Moving wild and mental, I made another five this week
Your money playing hide and seek
I don't even like to speak
I just tell 'em "Hi" and "Bye"
Slide off, automatic Hyundai, Hyundai, Hyundai

[Chorus]
Doing styles on them like it's common sense
Hopped out the Benz like it's common sense
Got a monkey on my feet like it's common sense
Got gorillas in the streets like it's common sense
Stack the money, heads up, like it's second nature
Gotta stay poled up, like it's second nature
Keep a chip in my ear, like it's second nature
Big bunda make me stare, like second nature

[Verse 2]
Said you're gonna do it, you haven't did it, nigga, I'm handling it
Handy with it, think I'ma do it? Let the hammer do it
Click, Bang!
Stick jam, like what happened to it?
Why's it not working, bruv?
Why'd you think I'm lurking, bruv?
Creep on him, lean on him, witnesses eavesdropping
Keep popping, and keep bopping like I ain't seen nuttin'
Don't make me upset, reach for an object
"Who's that in the passenger?" "Brown skin chocolate"
She's got big body, breasts in my face when she grip on me
Lick on me, jugg money, I got the lick on me
You're not popping, never popped nuttin', my nigga, stop bluffing
F your opinion, always destined for brilliance
Wouldn't rest in a million, hitters dressed as civilians
All them masked up, looking creepy
Park up, jump out, spark off, jump in
Skrrt round like it's too easy
If anybody ask, you didn't see me

[Chorus]
Doing styles on them like it's common sense
Hopped out the Benz like it's common sense
Got a monkey on my feet like it's common sense
Got gorillas in the streets like it's common sense
Stack the money, heads up, like it's second nature
Gotta stay poled up, like it's second nature
Keep a chip in my ear, like it's second nature
Big bunda make me stare, like second nature

[Outro]
It's in the genes, you know what I mean?
All types of fuckery
