[Intro: DoccyDocs]
Oi mate, If you out'ere
Getting this wonga
Then this one's for you
Entitled lean and bop by Hustla

[Hook: J Hus]
Lean, lean, lean, lean
Lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop
Do a lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop, bop, bop, bop
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side

[Verse 1: J Hus]
I step in the room
They all notice that
And if you know you're hot
Throw you're shoulders back
Like, they all notice that
And if you know you're hot
Throw you're shoulders back
Yo, my dance so cool
Even road men do it
Make a young boy and an old man do it
In the back of the B.M
Blasting out reggae
Pass me the zeggae
Nah, you're not ready
Yeah, all I need is gwop
Count another rack
Then I lean and bop
Girls do it with me
If you're feeling hot
If you ain't getting down
Make the beat, just stop
I love chocolat-o
But I never eat the KitKat
Baby girl, I ain't got time
For no chit-chat
You keep telling me to take time
And kick back
But I will be out'ere
Till it's pitch black

[Hook]
Lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop
Do a lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop, bop, bop, bop
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side

[Verse 2: J Hus and DoccyDocs]
They all clock my face
When I'm up in the scene
Do it reverse and do a bop and a lean
Just the other day
I met the girl of my dreams
Shawty, I love the way you twirl
In them jeans
Show me your Oooohhhh
All the sexy girls say AuhAuhAuh
Then I hit em with that
Then I hit em with that
O-O-O, Oh My
I love chocolat-o
But I never eat the KitKat
Baby girl, I ain't got time for no chit chat
You keep telling me to take time
And kick back
But I'mma be out'ere
Till it's pitch black
Ay yo, North side
Show me your lean and bop
East side
Show me your lean and bop
South side
Show me your lean and bop
West side
Show me your lean and bop
Ay yo, rude boy
Show me the lean and bop
Sexy girl do the lean and bop
Ay yo, rude boy
Show me the lean and bop
Sexy girl do the lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop
Do a lean and bop
Lean and bop
Lean, bop, lean, bop, bop, bop, bop
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your wooly hat lean to the side
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side
And if you're feeling the vibe
Make your woolly hat lean to the side

[Outro: DoccyDocs]
Cor' Blimey
Oi, Hustla
You got these birds and geezers going crazy out'ere you know
It's mad, It's bonkers
Do the lean and bop
Do the lean and bop (J.O.A.T)
Do the lean and bop
