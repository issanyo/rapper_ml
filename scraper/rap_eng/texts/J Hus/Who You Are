[Chorus]
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see

[Verse 1]
If I kept my enemies close what would it be like?
Unless there's a body, every night, I couldn't sleep right
I know niggas who retaliate twice
'Cause if two wrongs don't make a right then maybe three might
I'm not a bad guy, you got the wrong end of the stick
But don't end up on the wrong end of the stick
Let's not even mention this shit
Like I was meant for this shit, like I'm literally lit
I need head until I cum, two chicks instead of one
Two heads are better than one, long time since I had fun
'Cause every time I bring a new chick to the base
She wants to keep her motherfuckin' camera in my face
I just want one ting who's got my back
But there's not one ting I can trust like that
And all these other bitches come and go, just like that
I can't stay boo, I like you but not like that

[Chorus]
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see

[Verse 2]
Standin' on a goldmine, it might be a landmine
Cah your spot could get blown up in no time
Back window, when the cops raidin'
Makin' money now, so we upgraded
All the losses we dun taken, young bosses in the makin'
Freedom on the line, forget the time I could be facin'
Low life, hungry for the high life
Politicians, can't dictate my life, see me on the high-rise
Whoever don't wanna grind is gettin' disowned
My pockets ain't fat, they're just big-boned
I sweet talk my chicks on the flip phone
She wanna send me nudes, but ain't no Whatsapp on a brick phone
This is a different type of sweater, keep your hands to yourself
You should really make a plan, for yourself
You need to stand for yourself, become a man for yourself
They screamin' gang 'til it's every man for himself

[Chorus]
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see
Find out who you are by the company you keep
As kids we saw things that no man should see
Same time there's nowhere that I'd rather be
The tinted windows make it harder to see
