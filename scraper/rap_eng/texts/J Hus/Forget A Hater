[Intro]
(Look at this fucking wasteman)
You see this?
J Hus? J Hus? Fuck J Hus innit, fuck J Hus

[Chorus: J Hus]
They don’t wanna see me shine
You ain’t down for the grind, I’m about chasing mine
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
Forget a hater
All I need is money and a bad B, money and a bad B
I see plenty plenty girls
I only got my eyes on you

[Verse 1: J Hus]
I stepped out, fresh trim and my Nike outfit
Turn down a badboy, no I highly doubt it (no way)
I see plenty plenty girls
I only got my eyes on you
Break all the rules, then we run from the law together
She’s like ‘damn boy, you know I love you more than ever’
Bad B, body looking like danger
Come on over, baby girl don’t be a stranger
Brown skin babe, I gotta find her
Nigga you be fully dressed in designer
I’ll take your girl while I’m dressed in my Nike hood
When she heard my song she said that I rhyme good
Hustler baby, it’s like you never understand
She’s like ‘damn you got a boner already?’
Nah nah nah that’s my big fat tooly in my underpants
‘Cause these niggas wanna catch me slipping

[Chorus: J Hus]
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
Forget a hater
All I need is money and a bad B, money and a bad B
I see plenty plenty girls
I only got my eyes on you

[Verse 2: NSG]
Oh yeah, I'm a hustla baby

Forget a hater, you know me I'm all about that paper
Girl a pree me like Vanessa
Flexing and finessing on a hater
Oh she eye me, me ah know she want

[Verse 3: NSG]

Me I was born different, got the blood of a Hustla
Have your main chick running errands like a butler
Motherfucking niggas yeah they fuck wid ya
You see be NSG and J Hus
Even paigons wanna slide and they rate us
Back in the date you can catch me in Range again

[Chorus: J Hus]
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind

Forget a hater
All I need is money and a bad B, money and a bad B
I see plenty plenty plenty girls

[Verse 4: NSG]
They don't wanna see me shine
Trapping everyday, I get the money because I grind
See, I'm living my life making ladies want to whine
Kotch for me girl 'cause you know you wanna shine
When we step into the rave, champagnes will be popping
419 trapping, yeah I'm spending me money
See, I'm living my life, oh lord
See, I'm living my life, oh lord yeah

[Chorus: J Hus]
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
They don’t wanna see me shine, you ain’t down for the grind
I’m about chasing mine
Forget a hater
All I need is money and a bad B, money and a bad B
I see plenty plenty girls
I only got my eyes on you
