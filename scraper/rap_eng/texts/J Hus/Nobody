Nobody
Got all the talk, 'bout all the guns, but no bodies
Bitch look pretty, but some of them gyal deh, got no bodies
'Bout you bag grams, who’s your rap fans?
Nobodies
Nigga lets bark, don’t take talk from nobody
Cause I don’t know these niggas
My niggas don’t know these niggas
So no love I show these niggas
'Cah they're nobody
Make the lead spark, don’t take talk from nobody
'Bout you bag grams, who’s your rap fans?

[Verse 1: MoStack]
N/A inna 'dis
Banging out spades in the whip (wo, wo, wo)
Yo bro, if you’re ready for the ting
We gon' need space in the whip (bring that chrome)
I chat to gyal, when I’m taking a shit
Mo are you taking the piss? (no, no, no)
Yo I wanna wear this outfit twice
But I can’t if I take this pic
Oi, where you from where you live (oh, wo, wo, wo)
Are you bloods, are you crips?
What’s your name, who you is?
Why you lookin' like this?
I don’t know this prick
I don’t know these dons
Where do they know me from?
Got me feeling like Stormzy, still
Why's your badge on the right?
Where you get that Stony from?
I don’t think that shit’s real
The police said "we know, that you know the name"
"Tell us, and you could be home today"
At 7pm, I said "no" to Jakes
If that was you, you'd be home by eight
If that was you, you would'a told on me
Rumour is these niggas wanna roll on me
They hate my name, caught no body
It’s peak now, the hit mans owed money
Run up in your car like (doomp, doomp)
Get out me car like (vroom, vroom)
Your team sounds like (pew, pew)
And our team sounds like (Boom, Boom!)
(Bang), C4
One shot, two shot, three, four
Run hide, nee-naws
Them guys leave yours

[Verse 2: Swift]
I don’t take talk from nobody
Gyal give me ugh she too mixed up
She tell everybody
Man posting pics with a Nokia
That that ain’t making moneys
Talking about your line on line
Bring that phone to the cemetery
Trap all the time
I am no trap god
Get the brick and shut it
I like some times with more times
Man got the smoke
Got the smoke
Gotta get the fucking like fuck it
And whose strap’s longer than mine
Shorty too long
And to knows, jab it
My mans a cool guy
But there’s no way I’m brining to mummy’s
Bad b, she a thief
She take the buddy
Sitting in the T
Loads of eating, loads above it
Up party with the yuck face
You know she ucking
If she deader than me
Ima die before she get the body
Man’s stacking up Ps
Man cashing out there the money
Man do up that road
Them man do road for nuttin’
They know bro got smoke
Smokie got your bredrin coughing
Them gyal they’re hoes
Running up on the road for nuttin’

[Verse 3: J Hus]
Long time I’ve been hoping
They don’t kill me over this petty gwap
I’ve been sleeping with one eye open
Looking like Fetty Wap
But I don’t understand homie
Back in the day you was the man
You use to have it all
It’s so sad to watch you fall
Remember riding through the ends
Five man trying to hold it down
Now I don’t ever touch a wheel
Boo I get chauffeured ‘round
Paiogons caught me lacking
And I never got showered
J Hus still breathing
Cause the shooter was a coward
Mr ugly fresher out the fifteen section
My YG’s fifteen and he’s fresh out of detention
Take him with me
Do a broad day booting
Feds on me so I spent four days cooling

[Hook: J Spades]

[Verse 4: Grizzy]
Keep it cool, can’t keep the tool
He can’t somebody
Cause the jakes saw me
All my little niggas get it done for me (one fiddy)
If I got it with me then I’m definitely getting somebody
Couple riddims then I drop the tape now I’m somebody
Told you girls you can’t be my girls she just a fuck buddy
But she love the brothers and she still around
Calling us somebodys
I swear I know your face
A couple years back you was a nobody
And then the other day I must’ve woke up
And now you’re somebody
Really you ain't gettin now money really
Them man said they wanna beef man
I was like wait they’re really
Fuck all the talk on the net
You ain’t really banging out clearly
I heard their man they’re snitches
I was like don’t come near me
Realist, couldn't give a fuck if you don’t think I’m peng
But the cats they’re the realist
Me, J Hus, J Spades on the tune
Everybody wanna hear it
All them boys there just rap but
They think nobody wanna hear it
