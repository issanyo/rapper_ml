[Verse 1]
Call your girls, Imma bring my dons
And we can all be friends
Whisper in the air
And tell her it's that time
You know how the story ends
Imma give it to you, give it to you, give it to you, give it to you
Like you've never had it before all I want is some more
Hustla Baby
Like you've never had it before
Baby girl spend the night
Cus I don't wanna end the night nananana
Baby girl spend the night
Cus I don't wanna end the night
You miss my voice and you miss my smile
I've been on my grime and you ain't seen me in a while
Cus I'm married to the money and I can walk her down the aisle
But I've been waiting for you
