[Intro]
All my hitters
All my hitters
All my hitters
All my hitters

[Hook]
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[Verse 1]
Talk about Hus, you better hashtag Ugly
These niggas wanna try me, and that really bugs me
Let me show you how we ride out
Big fat dotty, ain't fitting in no Nike pouch
No WhatsApp, no ring, we no want pick up
Ridin' round with the baddest bitch doing stick ups
Don't make a sound pussy boy, don't hiccup
Girls on my tool, everybody get lit up
Niggas never killed me, but they should've
I bang, bang and I still get Mulla
I bang, bang and I still get Mulla
Revenge tastes even sweeter than sugar
I've already lost my heart
They wanna see me lose my mind
They wanna see me use my nine
They wanna see me boogie with the devil on the dance floor, go jail and do my time

[Hook]
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[Verse 2]
I be grinding all day, I make ninety-nine sells
I'm ready for war, I got ninety-nine bells
Go get her and let off the AuhAuhAuh
That's ninety-nine years if that pussy boy tells
You go get this work like you're jobless
Dirty girl, I must confess, I wanna see you get topless
I just like to suck breasts
Say you bust guns, we don't believe you
Say you push bricks, we don't believe you
Say you fuck girls, we don't believe you
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Say you bust guns, AuhAuhAuh
Me I can show you that
But fuck a hand out, cos I don't owe you that
They didn't wanna know me before, now they wanna spend time
Why you phoning me for?

[Hook]
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
All my hitters let off the AuhAuhAuh
All my trappers selling that AuhAuhAuh
Take your girl and give her the AuhAuhAuh
No lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
