[Intro]
JAE5

[Verse 1]
Little Kojo's scared
Kojo stressing
Kojo run off
Left his blessings
Left his pride
Left his bredrin
Kojo's lying, time for confessions
Kojo what?
Kojo who?
Kojo, ooh I make more Funds then you
And I don't like bragging
But, I be on the winning team
That's why the opposition white flagging
I made my first grand and never looked back
5 figures made me not like niggas
100 bags gave me sweet dreams
Opps are watching, I'm blowing bare kisses
Heard dem boys wanna pause on me
Man'a cook him off the block like Shaun
They got away with murder
They got away with murder
They got away with murder
And this is J Hus reborn
I wanna go there and Uhhh
Nah, I can't say that
Feds listening, I can't talk about payback
But please akh'
Don't play foolish
Cuz you know exactly what your crew did
Ro-Ro rolling with my new boo boo
You ain't seen her she's a foreigner
Pinky ring looking like real juju
Make Zd's disappear like Obeah
So what do you want from me?
What do you, What do you want from me?

[Hook]
Delajore, Delajore, Delajore
I want that long dough
I want that french bread
I heard them girls from Paris give the best head
Delajore, Delajore, Delajore
I want that long dough
I want that french bread
I heard them girls from Paris give the best head

[Verse 2]
Counting money in the drop-top
I swear I'm having deja vu
My princess... Counting paper too
French kiss to any bitch that wanna hate on you
And if you're working at 9 to 5
Or you gotta hit the trap
Just to try survive
Baby go and get that paper
Baby go and get that paper, paper
You wouldn't kiss your girl If you knew where that shits been
Yatties wanna get down with the fifteen
Get down with them OZ smashers
She a good girl but she a lowkey badders
I'm with the real heat clappers
Rolling in bangers
In them stoney swaggers
I don't know these rappers
And she ain't ever seen proper dough
I be busting on the collar bone
That's just how it's gotta go

[Hook]
Delajore, Delajore, Delajore
I want that long dough
I want that french bread
I heard them girls from Paris give the best head
Delajore, Delajore, Delajore
I want that long dough
I want that french bread
I heard them girls from Paris give the best head
