Hust-a-la-baby
Hust-a-la-baby
Ah-ha-uh-ha
Ah-ha-uh-ha
Yo, listen
Zoot in my right hand, dotty in my left one
Lock off the scene if my crep get stepped on
Now your girl wants woody from a rebel
Girl I don't wind I only boogie with the ah-ha-uh-ha
I give her this feeling inside
She love the way my woolly hat lean to the side
Brown skin babe I fell in love with the cocoa
And these niggas got me moving kinda loco
The beef gets cooking
Nah we don't hide
Im in the passenger side of my best friends ride
Two niggas in the front
Two niggas in the back
Past me the nines coz J Hus never scraps
Now i got your girl all gassed off my lingo
E-le-le-le oh my bad that was Timbo
I meant hust-a-la-baby, J Hus kinda wavy
Can I put my trust in you lady?
Baby gyal I need you, come to my gaff
Bad B plus a hustler, you can do the math
I used to be a little man
Now you see the kids grown
You ain't got no bricks, pussy boy you got a brick phone
Done a couple crimes now they label me a criminal
Hope and pray but I ain't waiting for a miracle
That's why I'm outchea baby, outchea daily
Stay with my tool 'cause round here's crazy
You ain't never been a friend of ours
I know some bad boys who go to lectures and seminars
I party with gangsters, and a couple Uni dons
I'll take your girl, no Prada, no Louis Vuitton
I'm in a tracksuit looking sporty
Banging Skrapz on a back road, doing forty
Chilling on the block
Nah, that's not me
Niggas wanna feature
Nah that's not free
Uh, yo and lemme show you the wave
Juju J slide through then I lock off the rave
Uh, yo and when you're talking 'bout artists
Hus better pop up in your thoughts as the hardest
Enter the party, Hus be the stick gripper
So I'm fully sober I can't sip liquor
But Aunty, I need you
Aunty come and whine 'pon my big tipper
