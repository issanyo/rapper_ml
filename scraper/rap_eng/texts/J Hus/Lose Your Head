[Chorus: Katy B]
Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone
Lose your head
Come on people let it go

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Yo, one two, check, is the mic on?
I keep on moving, keep on moving with the lights on
I'm in the club, having a good time, you get me?
And I don't drink, but I'll Bob Marley if they let me
Baby girl, you're flawless and it's funny cause you hardly try
That's why I'm sitting here, giving you the naughty eye
You claim you're bad, now it's time for you to prove it
I wanna see you go crazy, I wanna see you lose it

[Chorus: Katy B]
Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone
Lose your head
Come on people let it go

[Verse 2: D Double E]
Yo, I feel live tonight
The vibe is just right tonight
I feel to touch mic tonight
Security's tight tonight
I've got my weed in my sock all night
I've been drinking a lot
I'm on my third sambuca shot
Free drinks all night, got the bar on lock
I wanna hear you say ooh ooh
Then I wanna hear you say ooh ooh
Budubupbup
Girls and the boys better make some noise
For the lyrical super duper ooh
Dirty-ty, that's me-me

[Chorus: Katy B]
Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone
Lose your head
Come on people let it go

Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone
Lose your head
Come on people let it go

[Bridge: Katy B]
What is this the club's gone crazy
What is this I see
No one moves the crowd like katy
No one dows it like me, no

What is this the club's gone crazy
What is this I see
Cause I bring that sound they crave me
No one does it like me, so lose your head

[Chorus: Katy B]
Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone (can you hear me coming)
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown (feel the beat keep bumping)
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone (watch the people jumping oh)
Lose your head
Come on people let it go

Lose your head
When you hear me on the microphone (can you hear me coming)
Lose your head
Turn it up and make the speakers blown (feel the beat keep bumping)
Lose your head
Till we're really in the danger zone (watch the people jumping oh)
Lose your head
Come on people let it go
