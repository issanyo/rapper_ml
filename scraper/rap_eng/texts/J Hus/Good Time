[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Yeah
I've been doing what I gotta do
I've been working all afternoon
Hit the store, get some alcohol
Hit up my weed man, first call
People, plenty wey be say they hustle for money
Monday to Sunday
Bring your problems and I'll bring my drugs
And we'll have a party, we'll have a good time

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Even girl affi grind and stack
How you think she lookin' nice like that?
She's mine if she makes eye contact
Fresh kicks, still got the price on that
Everybody watch me like man some star
Big bunda babe in Manchester
Gyaldem churpsin, man like rah
Ya dun kno', she's a gang member

[Pre-Chorus: J Hus]
She know the squad, she know the crew
From long time, it's been overdue
From across the room, I noticed you
And out of all these girls, I've chosen you
She know the squad, she know the crew
From long time, its been overdue
From across the room, I noticed you
And out of all these girls, I've chosen you

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Yeah
I've been doing what I gotta do
I've been working all afternoon
Hit the store, get some alcohol
Hit up my weed man, first call
People, plenty wey be say they hustle for money
Monday to Sunday
Bring your problems and I'll bring my drugs
And we'll have a party, we'll have a good time

[Verse 2: J Hus]
Well let me get a private one
Thought she was soft, she's a violent one
Baby girl, you're too feisty, that's cool by me
But can you handle a dude like me?
Roll up in somethin' trendy
I'm so ugly that I'm sexy
And I'm silent and deadly
But I still wanna get friendly

[Pre-Chorus: J Hus]
She know the squad, she know the crew
From long time, it's been overdue
From across the room, I noticed you
And out of all these girls, I've chosen you
She know the squad, she know the crew
From long time, its been overdue
From across the room, I noticed you
And out of all these girls, I've chosen you

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
Yeah
I've been doing what I gotta do
I've been working all afternoon
Hit the store, get some alcohol
Hit up my weed man, first call
People, plenty wey be say they hustle for money
Monday to Sunday
Bring your problems and I'll bring my drugs
And we'll have a party, we'll have a good time
Bring your problems and I'll bring my drugs
And we'll have a party, we'll have a good time
