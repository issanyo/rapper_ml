[Intro: Fekky]
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke, they don't want no smoke
Let me show them how to make a banger
Say they do it like me? You're a bloody liar

[Chorus: Fekky]
It's a madting, sadting
My brudda it's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
My brudda it's a madting, sadting

[Verse 1: Fekky]
Madting, sadting
Can't mix up the road ting and rap ting
'Cause them niggas on the road darg, are rattin'
And them niggas in the rap ting, are acting
Ay cuz it's a madting, sadting
I walk up in the dance dawg, with mad bling
And we ain't inna scuffing or fighting
It'll be straight thunder and lightning
Catch me with my black ting, my white ting
With my shirt shoes, the right ting
Tell them niggas "low me, I'm flexing"
I ain't in the Porsche cuz I'm in a next ting

[Chorus: Fekky]
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting

[Verse 2: Mostack]
Dally
OK I'm coolin' with my squad, that's squadin'
Your bum ain't gettin big babygirl stop squatting
Came with thirty niggas, aw yeah that's mobbin'
I just killed that pussy then I skrrt like Scottish
Some gyal takin pictures I photobomb
My booboo she's dis l say it's Photoshop
Can't take booboo on a date because them niggas that hate me
And I don't wanna show my hood side to a lady
Dash my Nando's in a pagans face if they catch me eating
Let my bed bugs bite if they catch me sleeping
She saw a Insta DM and she saying that she leaving (How?)
Baby you can't leave cah you never caught me cheating
She's as bad as as mad is, she's in the crib with gangbangers
She like to bang us and bang us she like to suck on bananas
Might roll in bandanas, I let off 2 or 3 scrammers
Them niggas climbing them ladders
Thought you were bad what happened?
Bruh it's a mad ting...

[Verse 3: Abra Cadabra]
Still up on the block, still up on the block
Said goodbye now for anyone that beat an opp
Fuck one on ones, we don't do that
Kush where the broom at, you gonna need a new hat
I see these niggas floss when they hop out
Car with the top down, oh they looking icy
When they hop out, I just creep up in the beamer with the glocc out
Pussy wah ya feel like? Watch your soul drop out

[Verse 4: Young Spray]
Grumpy, leave man feets looking lumpy
Hit with the pumpy, man down humpty dumpty
It's my time are you dumb g? I can get you shot for like one g
I'll just come on your ends with a young g, tell me what you want g?
This ain't what you want g, you can bring two man I will bun tree
Then just bill up a one tree
Man will shot your tings dem on Gumtree
I will let shots fly, two days later cause I'm right in Dubai
[?] why? One gunshot in the eye

[Verse 5: Ms Banks]
Yeah bitch its mad ting sad ting
Anytime I walk away dawg, glad ting
Cause I out here whippin' real work, ain't a flat ting
In Jamaican with the real don, we ain't acting
Nigga, tell me who really with you ain't with the shits
Life a movie and getting it, me, [?] and  [?]
Eating good like a fat bitch, tactics
Cook clean and look good, thats a hat-trick

[Verse 6: Stefflon Don]
Rolling on the strip, bags on my hip
Niggas looking at me up and down [?] hella stiff
Five minus four, get to know who you fucking with
Ain't talking about no producer when I say there's forty on my wrist
Big piff from the E5th
Pretty chick with the blue wig and she slim tit
Titty big with a blue tick, thought you knew this?
Getting way more money than them niggas that been trappin' since 06

[Chorus: Fekky]
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting

[Verse 7: J Hus]
Ay yo, don't phone my line I'm fuckboy avoiding
The bonsam need oiling, my bobo need spoiling
Cute and caramel, when I bun she no like the smell
Inhale then exhale, blew up off a magic spell
Momma do [?], I'm parro, two uckers parallel
In the big puffa looking XXL
Looking like an astronaut, looking like bare money
But I'm not one to talk, don't know what the mandem thought
It's a mad ting when I bring the goons dem out
See the big ting that will make you shut up your mouth
Flexing on a next ting, your girl keeps texting
Sees annoying she want me and not my bredrin
Wanting wanting cause I'm getting getting
Flexing your face because I'm petty petty
The hitman done something dirty dirty
Running from the boys with the walkie talkie

[Chorus: Fekky]
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
It's a madting, sadting
(Bubububbang)
