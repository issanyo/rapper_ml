J Hus
Hasta la baby
Link Up TV, street heat, uh

The beef gets cooking, niggas start making phone calls
If the beef gets cooking, I ain't gotta get vocal
And if it ain't on me, then trust me, it's local
I won't beat around the bush, I'll get my beater out the bush
Girls 'dem on man, I'm anything but sweet
I know about grafting, I had food up in my butt cheeks
Plus I built a monk line, that rings like a cunch line
Made my re-up Ps back and it ain't even lunch time
These girls fuck with paigons so I don't really trust none
Put my shank in my waist before I even put my socks on
I've been up and down, money smells like body odour
You won't get nowhere sitting on that bloody sofa

Ohh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line
I said ohh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line

I'm rassclart paro, 'cause everybody's booky
They heard I'm doing juju, now niggas think I'm spooky
That nigga be a paigon, we used to go the same school
Had to buss' it at him just to show him that we ain't cool
They shanked my nigga up, that's what makes my blood boil
Pass me the nines, I'm fully loyal to the soil
Trust me, I'll drop suttin' like I'm clumsy
End up back in jail, writing letters to my mumsy
I might hit the can, tell Creeper roll a big ting
Tell my little bro, don't be nothing like his sibling
Tell that bad beat come here 'cause I'm feeling horny
If I drop a little game, I'll be beating surely
Yo b, what's your name? What's your number?
Face looking pretty but I'm staring at your bumper
I took the black girl, told Creeper take her friend
I can't really trust her, she be from a paigon ends
I tried to compose myself, I tried so hard
Her body make an atheist say "Oh my God"
She might line me up, fuck it, I'll just take a tool
Hit it from the back, like Rico off of Paid in Full
She loves the way I rap
She loves it when I'm talking grease
She needs a lift home
Baby girl, you shoulda' bought some Ps
J Hus, I'm the hardest out my borough
Roll in with a big ting, no it ain't borrowed
Why? It's 'cause these roads; they never show you love
And when it's peak, all your dons don't even know you bruv
Me, I'm from the fakest ends, I ain't into making friends
Fuck this life
I let my mum down, I gotta make amends
I gotta make ends meet like organised beef
I only showered ten times in over five weeks
I ain't got time for that
I got a grand to stack
You broke boys, I dunno where your mind is at
No word of a lie, this is all me darg'
But it's like they don't rate us
They say Potter, Bonkaz and Stormzy's hard
Next time you better mention J Hus

Ay reload the beat, reload the beat
Lemme kill it again, part two
Go on, reload the beat
Uh, listen, J Hus
Free Flamer, free everyone
Listen, Stratford
Newham, East London
East London's ugliest, take that I'm the hardest
Listen

I said "damn, homie"
Uh, back in the days you was the man, homie
Ahh man
You went from bricks to Qs
You got the trap confused
And now I heard he's scheming, I'mma put my shank to use
Like ooh
I don't wanna do it
But why all these fucking niggas have to keep putting me through it
These niggas wanna see me lose my cool
Lord forgive me if I use my tool

Grind hard for this shit
Get this money, try and move my marge out the bits
What d'you think I grind for?
This is mumsy's paper
All these niggas spilling beans like a clumsy waiter
Informer, sold a couple draws
Now he thinks he's Rich Porter
Like he don't know how the story ends
If I can't catch the pussy boy, I'll probably bore his friends
Three hundred bells, let the war commence
I stepped out in my trackie looking broke as fuck
I backed out a couple stacks, now she knows what's up
I couldn't get a boner, I might have to pop a V
Well I guess these broke bitches ain't my cup of tea
I need a classy girl, only wifey or spice
I need a girl with a body
25 to life
Show me what that tongue do, I ain't into French kissing
I need that brains that will have a nigga's legs twitching
I be in the passenger, bad b next to me
She gives the brain that will send a man to ecstasy
That's my rider
She keeps my tooly in her purse
I love her so much, I had to put her in a verse
Uh, type of girl to take the wrap and ride a bird for me
She gets worried whenever she hasn't heard from me
Course what I like
Jollof rice with the plantain
Fuck so good, I might treat her to some champagne
I be on my grind, so warn me if you see the ralis
All these packs I'm tryna' lick out, I don't even 'nani
Likkle teaser on her, soon you'll be a big boss
I wanna be rich forever, Rick Ross
You never gave me a drink when I was dehydrated
You gon' want a handout when you see I made it
Are you mad? You 'dey craze?
You better just forget it

They don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line
I said ohh, they don't wanna grind
Go get a day job, go bill a line

I said "damn homie"
Uh, back in the days you was the man, homie
Ahh man
You went from bricks to Qs
You got the trap confused
And now I heard he's scheming, I'mma put my shank to use
Like ooh
I don't wanna do it
But why all these fucking niggas have to keep putting me through it
These niggas wanna see me lose my cool
Lord forgive me if I use my tool, ay
