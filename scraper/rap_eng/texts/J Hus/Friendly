[Pre-Chorus]
Posted on the block like a low life
I like my Fanta with no ice
She said my lifestyle is no nice
But my woody so good it make her blow twice, ayy
Why you don't grind? You no like money? (What?)
We spend money like we no like money (What?)
She love a ugly man making pretty money
And I'm a ugly man making sexy money

[Chorus]
And I just wanna get friendly with her
Wanna get friendly with her
You see a big batty, where ya find that?
Make her pull up and rewind that
I just wanna get friendly with her
Wanna get friendly with her
You see a big batty, where ya find that?
Make her pull up and rewind that

[Verse 1]
I get fried with my jiggas
Or the bowcats can smoke the roaches
Mr. Ugly, what, you didn't notice?
Mr. Ugly even Mama knows this
And I got something for you cock-a-roaches
Them man move janky, you nah mean?
Them man move fishy like sardine
They wanna watch me while I'm watchin' Charlene
Ju-ju-jump in the whip and make the car lean, ayy

[Bridge]
Hey, big batty gyal, good evening
I can see that your chicken needs seasoning (flavour)
Big batty gyal, good evening
I can see that your chicken needs seasoning
Baby, bend over and break your back
Bring your friend over and break your back
The way she bend over and break her back
I nearly fell over and broke my back

[Verse 2]
Ugly man but the money look handsome
Sexy girl wanna hold me for ransom
But when the money callin', she throw a tantrum
'Cause when the money calling she get abandoned
She no understand where I come from
We grind so hard, Inner London
But without big batty I can't function
She put it on a plate and I want some

[Bridge]
Big batty gyal, good evening
I can see that your chicken needs seasoning (flavour)
Big batty gyal, good evening
I can see that your chicken needs seasoning
Baby, bend over and break your back
Bring your friend over and break your back
The way she bend over and break her back
I nearly fell over and broke my back
