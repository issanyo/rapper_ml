[Verse 1]
My girl dripping in lotion
I'm living so gruesome
They be thinking I'm joking
All the shit I'm involved in
Pop goes when the whip is in motion
My ting pop I'm a pop star
Then I popped up with Popcaan
I'm poppin off I'm popular
They're watching me through binoculars
Cause as you know I got a dodgy past
And he's beefin me aw bless him
When they told me I tried not to laugh
Madness if they cross my path
The same shit for your entourage
Man don't talk man pop
Oh wait hold up that's not the bar

[Chorus]
Doing pop with my hoody up
Ride to the guap like giddy up
I grab them up when I get the drop
When I see the guap I just clean it up
All the money
I want all of the monnies
Do it all for the monnies
More importantly monnies
What's more important than monnies

[Verse 2]
I step on your block with the Africans
Never been a comparison
You make no moves your a manakin
I swear beefin with you is embarrassing
I'm illegal ballin I'm travelling
I'm on probation no travelling
200 grams in Travelodge
Clientele come travelling
The baddest bitches wanna tour with us
They love my team they want all of us
If skivers here who wants war with us
Plus the kick back is marvellous
Oh whatchu thought you gon' spar with us
We beefin everyone apart from us
I beg you won't keep apart from us
The money can't stay apart from us
My hitters grew up all fatherless
He grew up and become a pharmacist
Just re-up the pack, just vanishes
He was born with this shit can't practice it
Nigga I'm back
Baby I'm back
Pat myself on the back
By myself in the back
Taking selfies and that

[Chorus]
Doing pop with my hoody up
Ride to the guap like giddy up
I grab them up when I get the drop
When I see the guap I just clean it up
All the money
I want all of the monnies
Do it all for the monnies
More importantly monnies
What's more important than monnies

[Verse 3]
Anything for the profit
Skeletons in the closet
Never been into gossip
More time I'm the topic
More time I'm not commenting
Ah yeah another thing
Didn't really wanna trouble him
Mana rob you and rub it in
All in your face
Look at your face
Don't even look at my face
I got lots and lots of face
From err what's her face
Looking fresh
I come clean like the truth
These old niggas wasted their youth
These likkle mans crying wolf
Get rich that's easier said
One verse that's easy bread
Most man wanna see me dead
Cah I came from the dirt like Vivi Said
I'm Aubrey with the one dance
The gyaldem only get one chance
She hates me but her eyes are on
The dick print in my sweat pants

[Chorus]
Doing pop with my hoody up
Ride to the guap like giddy up
I grab them up when I get the drop
When I see the guap I just clean it up
All the money
I want all of the monnies
Do it all for the monnies
More importantly monnies
What's more important than monnies
Ah Ah
Ah Ah
