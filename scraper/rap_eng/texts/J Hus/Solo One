[Intro]
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
(JAE5)
Step it on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one

[Verse 1]
White girl Carolina she be in the jook with them
She love dem' rides out and them beaters
Can't forget my white girl- Davina
You be looking curly in your black dress
Double barrel under the mattress
Turn your mandem to ash
My booboo cooking bangers and mash
Them boy pretty
J Hus gruesome
Them boy bowcat
I could never trust them
Whats that smell?
Think i smell bacon
You weren't in them cabbies, you was banging on them paigons
My don grip the strally
Long sticks I carry
Couldn't give a damn about no tom dick or harry
Alisha with the batty
Thats one chick ill marry
Hit it from the back and tell her come quick for daddy
Hit it from the back and tell her come quick for daddy
Hit it from the back and tell her come quick for daddy
Left a chick ugly, ugly like me
Ill take one for the team and ride that bird for my niggas
Lookin' for me i ain't hard to find
My niggas ride out to just past the time
Now my new ting buggin' me because i forgot to call
Baby girl y'know you drive me up the wall

[Outro]
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
(JAE5)
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
Step it,  on a solo one
Couldn't give a damn if i don't know no one
