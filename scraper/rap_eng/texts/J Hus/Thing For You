[Intro: J Hus]
Hustla baby

Small girl, you don't know the ting
If she ain't naughty, I don't want none
Good girls ain't no fun

[Verse 1: J Hus]

Trust another man's girl, no chance
I see everything crystal clear
That's why I brought my... here

Approach her, woolly hat lean to the side
Toking a zeggae, lean and I'm fried
Yo, the girls dem on man, I never been a peng ting
Niggas wanna beg friend, that's not my bredrin, nah (no way)
They clock my face when I step in
Uh, they clock my face when I step in

[Hook: J Hus]
You're not mine (hustla baby)
But you're just my type
And I know just what you like (Oooohhhhh my)
I ain't got a ring for you, but you know I got a thing for you
If she ain't naughty, I don't want none
Good girls ain't no fun

[Hook: J Hus]

If she ain't naughty, I don't want none
Good girls ain't no fun
