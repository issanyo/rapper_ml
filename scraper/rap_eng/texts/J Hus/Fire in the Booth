[Verse 1: J Hus]
I swear I love you and hate you at the same time
I swear I love you and hate you at the same time
I can't get away, she can't get away either
Now were outchea doing stick-ups shes my getaway driver
Hanging out the window, I love the thrill, I love the feeling
You can tell its me cos my woolly hats leaning
Bag full of money and a chick thats down to ride for him
Thats all a brother really needs in this life of sin
I stepped out the smart car, old shaped huaraches on
Smelling like the dankest piff, shout-out my yardie don
J Hus boogy dance, when I get my party on
Ayo my yute where you get your carty from
Oh it's gone missing it wasn't me, I was smiling wid him
J Hus pass by, swear I saw your wifey wid him
You gon' have a tiny temper
I just heard your wifey riddim
You gon' have a tiny temper (yo)
I used to ride for the 15
Yeah I'm really from here
Grind till I gone clear
You only grind for that Moncler
Seen my mother drop tears
No it doesn't stop there
Life they say it's not fair
Trap hard we don't pop squares
No, no no no no no no noooo no
You either prey or you get preyed on
Let me show you where I came from
This the belly of the beast
We're robbing bellies in the East
I swear I love you and hate you at the same time
I swear I love you and hate you at the same time
I can't get away, she can't get away either
Now were outchea doing stick-ups shes my getaway driver

[Verse 2: J Hus]
I got my knees in the dirt, blood on my hands
Tears in my eyes but the years made me wise
Death around the corner so I fear for my life
But they don't love me so I don't wanna hear all the lies
Yo, and if I wait for a bring-in
I'll be waiting till the cows come home
I've been through a thousand phones
Long time I ain't been crib, now it feels like my house ain't home
And big man wanna ride on me
They don't wanna grind for their daughter
Big sticks in a mans face
Boom boom turn a man water
My life spans shorter
Extra bells in my pocket when I'm coming with them tings
Jummah on a Friday to wash away the sins
And plus my section baiter
Clap man first, ask questions later
I know Burna Boy I don't know Whizkid
Draw for his tool he will turn a boy liquid
They wanna try man, are you kidding me
I'm rolling with a big ting that's bigger than Likkle T
Stay away from me, at least arms length
And when you're talking olders you're talking past tense (yo)
I don't look up to no one
No new beef so I'll cook up the old one
I'm in No Mans land in the coldest districts
My dons flip Z's and be throwing biscuits
Feds got me ducking and diving
I don't understand how we're fucking surviving
I gotta link the plug but I might be delayed
Feds taking mugshots for ID parade
I really should be outchea, tryna make mills
Instead I'm in a cell eating microwaved meals (Yo)
Riding out ain't paying me
But they went and put my bro up in A&E
I can't sit back, I got two guys with me
Kick back, make a brudda move like Grizzy
Bare live corn in a four door truck
If I came earlier I would have saw more luck
North Face jacket same one from the crib session
Tryna catch an M Dargg, you can hold 67
I knew I had to wise up from early
Trap money got my bruddas riding in Burberry (What?)
Oh my what a journey
20 man ducking like I got the lurgies (What?)
You can run but you can't hide (What?)
I had to show them my dark side
Mum told me love turns boys into men
For the love of the money I got boys in the pen

[Verse 3: J Hus]
Dead broke, sitting on my last tenner
Pray one day that my life will get far better
Fuck beefing with these cowards and neeks
Three hours of sleep and I ain't showered in weeks
I'm on my grind baby
Robberies or selling packs
Mummy went through hell and back
I love you with my heart
But I don't ever tell you that
I'm on my grind I can't afford to stay
But I'm only one phone call away (Ahh)
The hustles got me breaching bail
I need grub, I need scales
I'm pissed off that P's in jail (Ahh)
Plus I lost all my P's as well
And my uncle keeps telling me I need a girl
To teach me how to be a man but he won't ever understand
That I've already tried this before
She got on her knees, and said she never tried this before
Then she lied even more
And told me that she loves me, and we broke all the rules
Nah we don't abide by the law but she's a dutty gyal
And I can never trust you again
You said it was love, love till the end
Fuck that, J Hus unattractive
Man will bun a fat spliff and get fuckin' active (Uh)
Spent half of a grand, for this dotty in the palm of my hand
But this weren't part of the plan
'Cause I'm from the City of Newham
Where I'll bore my old friends like I never even knew 'em
Like we never used to play in the park
You'll get blazed when I bark
But your memory will stay in my heart
That's how things go
I got rushed last week the same day I let my ting go (Ahh)
That means he's here for a real reason
Cos he never got hit and hes still breathing
Shots won't get sent from the car
I'll let my ting go then repent to Allah
Long time, long time, I ain't been Jummah
Outchea, outchea, chasing this mullah
One day I'll leave this whole life and practise Islam
'Cause the music and trap its haram, no more straps in the palm
Mums crying i keep telling her to stay calm
Even though her son got gripped by the Shaitan
Boogy with the devil with my shades on
J Hus astalababy
