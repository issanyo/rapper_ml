[Intro]
I like your style
I like your style

[Verse 1]
Alexander McQueen with the roundneck
Told the promoter, I'll be two secs
Had to sex two chicks before soundcheck
She looked deep into my eyes and gave me proud neck (yeah)
That's my new broad, always text her when I'm too bored
Have her posin', Madame Tussauds
Baby, what's the craic? What's the story? (What's going on)
Baby, what's the craic? What's the story?
Fuck up the 'ussna in my sunglasses
Bartenders and pole dancers in my hotel with no trousers
Me and her, we're just alike man, we're so heartless
So you text her, get no answers
I don't text her, that's extra
Had her skippin' lecture
Fuckin' uni bitches throughout the whole semester
The bed ain't made for one so I'm sharin' it
Anythin' you need, tell Frank he'll take care of it

[Chorus]
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)

[Verse 2]
Bad B lickin' on my earlobe
Versace bathrobe, everytin' high-class
Pour the CÃ®roc in the wine glass
Big booty in the jacuzzi, just to let the time pass
Tryna take in all these W's (winnin')
Money come, now I do what I wanna do (anythin')
Getting brain while I eat my cereal
Skinny man, take on BBW
You know the big girls need lovin' too (yeah, they do)
And I'm the one they keep comin' to (I'm the man)
All the gyaldem wan' hookup
Even my next door neighbour came askin' for sugar
We on the same page, no need for a discussion
Then we do somethin' disgustin' (ewww)
Still ugly, but I'm not fussin' (what?)
J Hus, even your mum loves it

[Chorus]
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your style (I like your style)

[Outro]
I like your style (I like your style)
Baby, what's the craic? What's the story?
Baby, what's the craic? What's the story?
