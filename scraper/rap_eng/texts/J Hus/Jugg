(Chorus)

Said you wanna be my only one
Been a long week let's have some fun
Oh baby yeah tell you wants good I can tell you wants good x2
Yeah me and my darggs they jugg x2
Would you ride with me would cunch will you line with me
So baby tell me what's good

(Baseman)

Said you wanna be my only one
Slow whine no camera on cause
I've been jugging from dusk till dawn
I couldn't tell you what them man were on( Like oh lawrd)
Girl your my baby my baby we go far
If that niggas tries it I'll shoot him like oh lawrd
Niggas wanna ride on me
Lawrd I'm a menace to society

(J Hus)

Hustla baby
Them brudda don't jugg right
I've seen them packs get shot I'm Suge Knight
It's about 4 o'clock in the afternoon
Axeman got the ting and he'll will blast a goon
You know I love my brown skin babies
Fine with her and my white chocolato
Said her old man was an asshole
Now she wanna chill and vibe with Mavado

(Chorus)

Said you wanna be my only one
Been a long week let's have some fun
Oh baby yeah tell you wants good I can tell you wants good x2
Yeah me and my darggs they jugg x2
Would you ride with me would cunch will you line with me
So baby tell me what's good

(J Hus & Baseman)

No another nigga is breathing will every give her this feeling
I'm a humble geezer but when I go made I give her jungle fever
And she won't leave me alone and I can't get away
That girl is poison I try avoid her but she won't leave me alone

She a trap queen and my baby stays cooking
Like Ace boggie my darggs been jugging
Fam I hate it when she moans
But I love it when you get jealous
When them other girls are looking
Nigga tell why you made I slide in your bm's
Like oh lawrd she slide in my dm's
My hot gyal be the flyest we be counting money untill we get arthritis

(Chorus)

Said you wanna be my only one
Been a long week let's have some fun
Oh baby yeah tell you wants good I can tell you wants good x2
Yeah me and my darggs they jugg x2
Would you ride with me would cunch will you line with me
So baby tell me what's good

(Baseman)

Said you wanna be my only one
Slow whine no camera on cause
I've been jugging from dusk till dawn
I couldn't tell you what them man were on( Like oh lawrd)
Girl your my baby my baby we go far
If that niggas tries it I'll shoot him like oh lawrd
Niggas wanna ride on me
Lawrd I'm a menace to society

(Chorus)

Said you wanna be my only one
Been a long week let's have some fun
Oh baby yeah tell you wants good I can tell you wants good x2
Yeah me and my darggs they jugg x2
Would you ride with me would cunch will you line with me
So baby tell me what's good
