[Verse 1]
I got love for all my people
She said I love you and I need you
Yeah love, I believe you
But I gotta love you and leave you
Smile of an angel
Don't let that deceive you
'Cause sometimes I'm evil
I just, I just

[Chorus]
And then clartin' it off, clartin' it off (oh my God)
My friend wann' bang, my friend wann' bang, so I start passin' it off
Woo, wait, yo, rah, that's enough
Pass it back, pass it back, lemme start clartin' it off

[Verse 2]
Driver take a right turn
My turn, my turn
Babyface with no sideburns
Bruv grown man, get dumped on
Pull my top where my face is
Come through topless and faceless (surprise)
Tour your block like I'm famous
With that superstar status

[Chorus]
And then clartin' it off, clartin' it off (oh my God)
My friend wann' bang, my friend wann' bang, so I start passin' it off
Woo, wait, yo, rah, that's enough
Pass it back, pass it back, lemme start clartin' it off

[Verse 3]
Won't call it an early day
On your side where the Turner stay (alright)
Other side of your mother's ride
What you can't drive you gotta learn today
On a one way to an early grave
Recline my seat back anyway (relax)
Forgot to plan my get-away
Put your foot on the gas like andale andale
What? Is that what you're doing now?
Whole ting get ruined now (what?)
I don't even know half my opps
Why I'm permanently screwing now (who is he?)
Is he a pagan? Not certain
No time for any conversing
Nearly clarted up the wrong person
Had to try and test if my stuff's working

[Chorus]
And then clartin' it off, clartin' it off (oh my God)
My friend wann' bang, my friend wann' bang, so I start passin' it off
Woo, wait, yo, rah, that's enough
Pass it back, pass it back, lemme start clartin' it off
And then clartin' it off, clartin' it off (oh my God)
My friend wann' bang, my friend wann' bang, so I start passin' it off
Woo, wait, yo, rah, that's enough
Pass it back, pass it back, lemme start clartin' it off
And then clartin' it off, clartin' it off (oh my God)
My friend wann' bang, my friend wann' bang, so I start passin' it off
Woo, wait, yo, rah, that's enough
Pass it back, pass it back, lemme start clartin' it off
