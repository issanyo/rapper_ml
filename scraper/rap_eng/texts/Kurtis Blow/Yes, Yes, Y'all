[Verse 1]
We party up in my white limousine
I'll take you places you ain't never seen
Well, baby this is it, no time for messin' around
We got to go uptown so we can get on down
So let down your hair, I don't care
With a def mini skirt, all the boys will stare
All the dogs start barkin', MCs start to talkin'
In the place to be, everybody starts talkin' to girls

[Chorus]
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)

[Verse 2]
Now sit on sit on back, and have a banana
While I tell you 'bout my main man Dr. Bruce Banner
My home boy Bruce ain't all that mean
But if you raise his temperature, he will turn green
His clothes will rip and his body grows
His feet turn big and everybody knows
That he's The Hulk, one big body
The main attraction at your party
The brother that's strong like a thousand men
He can break brick walls and your bars he'll bend
Now Bruce was chillin' one Saturday
Was by himself with nothing to say
Then, this big hairy creature came from the sky
Bruce ran away thought he was gonna die
Then he thought to himself this guys just bulk
I'm gonna kick his butt as the incredible Hulk
Bruce came back all green and big
And he kicked his hairy butt, dig
You don't believe, run it through a scanner
And that is the story of Dr. Bruce Banner

Yeah, that Bruce Banner, boy
That boy is def
The Incredible Hulk
Run it down D

[Verse 3: Kool Rock Ski]
As I proceed to rock the rhymes you need
To any race or creed, I'm supplyin' the beat
'Cause my name is Kool some call me Rock
Last part is Ski 'cause I'm the cream of the crop
Now I'm the power Lord rocker the Chief of the East
As I get slower my rhymes increase
To a certain peak that break all rules
'Cause when I rap, sucker MCs choose
'Cause the words I preach for you to hear
To take a look with your eyes and open your ears
'Cause my smile is better than anyone ever
I'm chillin' with Lees and I don't wear leather
'Cause MCs can't be beggars, and beggars can't be choosy
I'm takin' out suckers like an MC Uzi
You push, you shove, you cannot move
'Cause I was made this big to crush MCs like you

[Chorus]
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, y'all (yes, y'all)
