[Prince Markie Dee]
Now you're coolin' at a dance standin' on the wall
But it's time to get steady and on the ball
Grab up a girl and get on the floor
And listen to Markie Dee's rhymes galore
Because the music is fresh, so darn funky
The highs are crisp and the bass is chunky
And the final ingredient, the movement of the feet
A complete street meet, a funky fresh treat
The jam is halfway through, you sit down for a while
A young lady approaches with a very big smile
She wants to dance, but your feet are sore
But later for that, you go and dance some more
You do the hustle, bus stop, and even the samba
You make up a dance called the islands of ramba
Yes on the dance floor, you're throwin' a fit
And that is a result when you, feel it!

Can you feel the rhythm of the funky bass?
Well it's kickin' it live in your face
The homeboys in the place are holdin' up the wall
While the girls are on the floor, giving their all
The man that's on the mic rappin' to a fresh beat
Is none other than the money-makin' Kool Rock Ski
The MC powerlord of the minion emcees
With the funky fresh rap that'll get you out your seat
So tell me can you feel it and relive to reveal it
'Cause if you do, my friends, you'll need a painkiller
Rock to the beat, put your body to it
Find a new dance and learn how to do it
So when you come in the place and feel our rhythm
You'll be on time with the def momentum
Stop perpetratin', get on the floor
And listen to the two with the rhymes galore!

[Prince Markie Dee & Kool Rock Ski]
Well now you gotta be convinced that the beat is fresh
So devastating, outlasting the rest
And our rhymes are fierce and always on fire
So get on the floor because it's for hire
A powerful sound that's so divine
Send a chill up your spine and rotate your behind
And we're [?] to the person who knows how to do it
So get on the floor and into it
So just start to rockin' when you feel the groove
And listen to us and bust a move
So move your body in every way
And don't stop rockin' 'til the break of day
We're the dedicated rappers on the M-I-C
One's Markie Dee, the other's Kool Rock Ski
And the question of the matter, we're asking to you
We can feel it, so can you feel it too?
