[Female Voices Echoing]
Fat (fat, fat) Boys

[Introduction: Shared]
Now, we may be a little chubby, but don't feel slump
We guarantee ya' one thing; we can surely come
To the party, and rock the house
As we harmonize, and start to turn it out
So bust a fresh move, and take it from me
Listen to the fresh sound of the Disco Three
Ha, ha!

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 1: Shared]
Prince Markie Dee (Kool Rock-Ski)
The Human Beat Box providing the beat
One-thousand pounds put all together
The disco brothers to last forever
And as we enter the room, you know the crowd starts waking
The crowd starts breaking
And my voice starts shaking to the funky rhythm
Of a beat so fast
To bust a fresh move to the rhythm of rap, Markie Dee

[Verse 2: Prince Markie Dee]
Now I'm Markie Dee, but you can call me the prince
And I have a slight problem
That I couldn't solve since I'm overtired
See I over ate
At a steady pace rate
Yeah I'm overweight
But it ain't no thing
Cause I'm always fresh
And guaranteed to pass any emcee contest
Like M&M candy will melt in your hand
So be a real live lover in where I stand
Now to some it might be funny
And some sort of boring
But listen to the words as I tell my story
Now it started out when I was very small
I devoured chocolate cake, plates, candles and all
For breakfast, it was teaser five pounds of bacon
And halfway through by stomach started shakin'
Toast on the side five gallons of juice
And that was just for breakfast when I start to get loose

[Chorus]
Fat Boys
You know they're down by law
Fat Boys
They givin' you much, much more

[Verse 2: Kool Rock-Ski]
Now my name is Kool Rock
Last part is Ski
And I am the captain rocker of the Disco Three
You see I get pizzaz, style, and grace
Just one slight problem; I'm a little overweight
But my walk is funky
My golden pop
Every time I touch a girl, they always yell stop
Because I'm down by law
I'm the king of the slop
But I know one thing my heart keeps inside
Says do the right thing and you will survive
People still put me down 'cause I'm the rest of the town
But I got one thing that's hard to beat by
I got class, yes; that's right, ladies
I'm a little overweight but
I'll pass, huh
I'm like glass
Yes I'm easy to break and if you get me wrong
Thats a chance to take
Yes my word is bond
And that's no mistake
Yes, you've heard my words
And that's my rap
So party people lock on to the beat called fat
The beat called fat will rock the spot
So party people rock on
To The Human Beat Box

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3: Shared]
To all the ladies in the place
I'm the prince of ease
And you have to scream please
If I'm on the freeze
Go below zero or steamin' hot
'Cause if you mess with the Prince, you're sure to get shot
'Cause I'm a ladies' man, a number one choice
Nominated five times for my platinum voice
Five foot eight, I got hazel eyes
And if you think I'm soft, you're in for a surprise
'Cause I'm hard as a rock and my name ain't Tom
Trying to battle me is like defusing a bomb
The red wire, the orange, the purple and blue
One emcee ain't enough, you're gonna need two
To beat me, so here's your chance
Get in your stance, make a little romance
Smoking things from plants
Taking pictures, I'm not a freelance, baby doll
Dominating emcee

And when I'm on the stage the ladies scream for me
We're fat We're fat
We can never be wack
And if you go for that
Then we'll be back
