What did you say your name was?

I see that its not clear
For you good buddy so clean out your ears
So listen very closely while I pop my game
Cause my name's in the Hall of Fame

The K-U-R, the T-I-S
The first is the best I must confess
The B-L-O and the W
Makes you wanna catch the boogaloo flu

Now, If your name is Annie
Get up off your fannie
If your name is Clyde
Get off your backside
If you name is Pete
You don't need a seat

Cause i'm Kurtis Blow and i'm on the go
I'm rocking to the beat in stere-ere-o

Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if your ready like Freddie to rock real steady
Somebody say, "Oh yeah!"

Young ladies, all the ladies in the house say, "Owww"
And you don't stop, come on, come on, come on, let me see you rock

Ah get down and stop messing around
When Kurtis Blow is in your town
I'm Kurtis Blow on the microphone
A place called Harlem was my home

I was rocking one day, it started to shake
It sound to me a-like a earthquake
I packed my bags, I said goodbye
I kissed my woman, and I started to fly

I came to Earth by a meteorite
To rock you all on the mic
So just kick off your shoes, let your fingers pop
Kurtis Blow's just about ready to rock

Now people in the back, if you're not the wack, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

People in the front, if you want to bump, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

People in the middle, if you want to wiggle, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

And people on the side, if you want to slide, say:
"Don't stop the body rock!"

Now a preacher or a teacher or a e-lec-tri-cian
A fighter, or a writer, or a po-li-ti-cian
The man with the key to your ignition
Kurtis Blow is competition

Young ladies, shock the house
Yes, the young ladies, shock the house

A-just throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

If you're really, really ready to rock the house this morning
Somebody say, "Oh yeah!" (Oh, yeah!)

Somebody scream

Young ladies, Mercedes, all the ladies in the house say "ow"
"Ow"

Say Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho-ho-ho!
