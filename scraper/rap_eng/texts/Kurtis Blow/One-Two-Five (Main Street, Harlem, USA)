Come with me and let´s take a trip
Where the scene is tough and the folks are hip
I can´t tell a lie cause it ain´t no myth
I´m talking about a Hundred Twenty Fifth

Foxy ladies everywhere
Skin tight jeans and jazzy hair
Clothes for the body, shoes for the feet
And lots of tasty things to eat

One Hundred Twenty Fifth Street
The people and the concrete
The hottest spot to work and play
Main Street, Harlem, USA

Original paintings on the walls
Music stores and bingo halls
Apollo´s gone, but that´s OK
There´s lots of music anyway

The Baby Grand is still going strong
Celebrity Club rocks all night long
Sikulu Records is on the case
And Bobby´s chillin´out in the same old place

Lots of folks have passed this way
Malcolm X and Billie Holiday
Fidel Castro, The Commodores
Heads of State and troubadours
The Count, The Duke, The Pres, The Bird
Have bought music and that´s my word
Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder
Have all come for Harlem´s thunder

Marcus Garvey and JFK
Meadowlark Lemon and Doctor J
And Doctor Martin Luther King
All came to Harlem to do their thing

Louis, Jack Johnson and Ali
The heavyweight to name but three
Bill Bojangles and James Brown
Spent their time in Harlem Town

Con-men, poets, saints and sinners
Three time losers and all time winners
Politicians, fools and sages
Enough to fill a million pages

So take the trip and come alive
The A train stops at One-Twenty-Five
Where I was born one August day
On Main Street, Harlem, USA
