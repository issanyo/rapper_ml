Throw your hands up, from my circle yard stand up
Get crunk, everybody keep dem hands up
Scream loud, this is the time to me rowd
Ima rock it til the music go off, please be proud
Stop playin, I want to see you shout anyway
Throw dem bows, off da wall, its a special occasion
Get yo dance on, wild out before the last song
Graba shawty, get crunk wit ya mask on
Ride quicker, and get on thee floor
I wanna see you do it like you never did it before
This the remix so you know I'm gone ball
Me and uncle Silkk came to spit it for y'all
Girls if you bout it, then get off the wall
Make em' bounce to the music ma give it your all
Party in, and party out right at da mall
If you got problems at the door then give me a call

Room to small tear the walls out
Shop til you drop mean shop til you fall out
You know how No Limit do go all out
Ain't my fault, we gotta get cash
Ain't my fault, ride bently and jag
Flashy type, like how we gone miss
Cause I got the baddest chick (Lil' Romeo:and I got her lil sister)
Silkk and Rome you know we stay off da chain
Concert pack you know they gone be screamin our name
Miller boyz look its all the same
If you love us or hate us its all a game
Say she heard about me and love that I ball
Love my height, she love that I'm tall
Then step one, now its time for step two
How can I ever go broke when I can borrow a million from my nephew
