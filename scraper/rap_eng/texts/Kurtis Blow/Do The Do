[Verse 1]
Sounds that you hear, so good to your ear
Have no fear Kurtis Blow is here
Ladies in the place with the bass in your face
Check out first place in the MC race
A motivatin', syncopatin', dominatin', hesitatin'
Rappin' son of a gun
And i'm lookin' for participation from the people of the nation
Making up a cut creation
Jam on the one

[Bridge]
Do the do (Do the do!)
Do-do the do (Do-do the do!)
Do the do (Do the do!)
Do-do the do (Do-do the do!)
Your mama (Your daddy!)
Your sister (Your brother!)
Your cat (Your dog!)
I'm just jokin'!

[Outro]
Do the do (Do the do!)
Do-do the do (Do-do the do!)
Do the do (Do the do!)
Do-do the do (Do-do the do!)
Say uh! (Uh!)
Say uh-uh! (Uh-uh!)
Say uh-uh-uh! (Uh-uh-uh!)
Now Scream!
