[Verse 1]
Hey yo, my man, I heard ya say
That I couldn't do the do
Well I can rock a spot, around the clock
While you're just the number two
And you can tell anybody, anything you want
But remember that I'm the man
So let's take it to the bridge, and see what's up
It's time to show your hands

[Hook]
Take it to the bridge
Take it to the bridge

[Verse 2]
I heard you say my game ain't tough
But you don't really know the deal
You can talk all day about how to drive
But it's different when you take the wheel
So come on up and take a chance
And pop your stuff all night
But people will still remember my name
When you drop out of sight

[Hook]
Take it to the bridge
Take it to the bridge
Uh oh
Take it to the bridge
Turn the horns on
Take it

[Horns]

[Verse 3]
I've seen 'em come and I've seen 'em go
But your good and you know it
But if you're gonna be the number one
You know, you've got to show it
You gotta take 'em up, you gotta take 'em down
You gotta turn 'em inside out
And when the deed is done, you'll be number one
And you'll hear 'em scream and shout

[Hook]
Take it to the bridge
Huh, huh
Ho
Ho now
Get down
Hey
Take it, take it, take it to the bridge
Take it to the bridge
Take it to the bridge
Take it to the bridge
Ho
To the baha, take it

[Horns]

Oww
Hey uh
Ha ha

[Verse 4]
I've seen 'em come and I've seen 'em go
But your good and you know it
But if you're gonna be the number one
You know, you've got to show it
You gotta take 'em up, you gotta take 'em down
You gotta turn 'em inside out
And when the deed is done, you'll be number one
And you'll hear 'em scream and shout

[Outro]
Take it to the bridge
Take it to New York
Take it to Chicago
Take it to LA
Take it to Boston
Take it to Philly
Take it to Cleveland
