Higher, flyer
Beatbox, my friend, how you doin' right now?
Right
[?] hey ya, [?] hey ya
And my friend, Kool Rock Ski, how you doin' partna?
Coolin' in the place to be, as we rock for hours a little something like this
And my name is, Markie Dee (right)
But you can call me the Prince
And right about this time, we're about to rock reggae with the Fat Boys
Hello teacher
Hello class
Begin

[Verse 1: Prince Markie Dee]
Now on the farthest island where corn was peeled
The father would work on the plantation field
But that was then, and now it is time
To celebrate the reggae man, with this rhyme
Now my name is Prince, code name Markie Dee
And the king of reggae, is the late, great Bob Marley
And there are other great men, and it must be said
That one of these men, is the one Sammy Dread
Also, Jacob Miller, and Dennis Brown
Michigan and Smiley, are the best around
There's also Sassafrass, and Welton Irie
And there's another great rapper, Colonel Desie
But let it be known, that I'm rapping OK
'Cause I am rapping, hard core reggae

[?]
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Part two

[Verse 2: Kool Rock Ski]
I be the certified rapper in the U-S-A
But I also like to rap to the beat of reggae
Peter Tosh is the man with the reggae voice
Worldwide musician, the people's choice
'Cause I'm takin' much control with the mic in my hand
I'm the reggae-rap chief like the King Yellowman
To soothe your body, with words so smooth
With beats so fresh, put you into the groove
Reggae music's so divine, it sounds so sweet
Guaranteed rock rhythm, to move your feet
'Cause it's me, Kool Rock, dominatin' MC
And I'm rappin' hard core, to the reggae beat
So everybody get ready, the beat is steady
And Fat Boys rap to the hard core reggae

Hands up, shoot 'em up, put 'em down
Shoot 'em up, now down, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em now, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em now, shoot 'em up
Hit 'em up

[Prince Markie Dee]
You got, things on your shirt
Girl you know, it hurt, 'cause it wasn't mine
Said it wasn't mine

Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
[?]

[Buff Love]
Reggae music is on fire, reggae music is so sweet
Reggae music got a funky, funky, serious beat
Vibrate your ears, and rock your mind
Make all the posses, move your behind
Ah-move, ah-left and then ah-right
You know reggae music, it sounds so nice
The people is fresh, the music is OK
Everybody to the beat called hard core reggae

[?]
Hit 'em up, shoot 'em up, hit 'em down
Hit 'em now, hit 'em up
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
That's on the parties and the fellas stand back
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
Do you like, do you like the way, the way
I walk that walk
Hard, hard, hard core reggae
