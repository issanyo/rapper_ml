[Intro]
It's party time (Yeah)
Woah it's party time
We live in a party (Yeah)
It's party time
Woah it's party time
It's party time
Woah it's party time
We live in a party
It's party time
Woah it's party time

[Verse 1]
In the capitol of the nation
There's a brand new sound sensation
It's gonna be a revelation
Gonna show you what I mean
They call it the E-U Freeze
Playin' pretty as you please
Beatin' on the drum and the keys
Rockin' on the Go-Go Scene

[Verse 2]
I hear your girlfriend just left town (Oh no, oh no)
And the bill collector's comin' around (Oh no, oh no)
To save you job you took a cut in pay (Oh no, oh no)
And you wife just said she's gonna stay (Oh no, oh no)
And the Russians may start World War Three (Oh no, oh no)
And things ain't what they used to be (Oh no, oh no)
Should we start a life of crime? (Oh no, oh no)
Then call your friends, it's party time!

[Chorus]
It's party time
Woah it's party time
It's party time
Woah it's party time
We live in a party

[Verse 3]
You're workin' everyday, trading sweat for tiny pay
Got no power, got no say, watch your life slip away
Tough stuff, five days, bad job, no raise
What'cha, what'cha, what'cha gonna do?
In the morning take the train
Bust your butt, and waste your brain
G-g-g-g got to be a better way for you
Hey fellas (What?)
Do you need a break? (You know we do)
Well I ain't got no break but how's about a party? (Well alright!)
Hey ladies (What?)
Do you need a break? (And you know we do)
Well I ain't go no break but how's about a party? (Well alright!)

[Verse 4]
Down on the street
They're cuttin' on the beat
They're livin' day to day on a nickel and a dime
But they've got the syncopation
To rock and shock the nation
They're ready to rock real steady at party time (Party Time!)

[Chorus]
It's party time
Woah it's party time
It's party time
Woah it's party time
We live in a party

[Verse 5]
Hey fellas (What?)
Do like those ladies? (You know we do!)
Well let's go downtown and meet them at the Go Go!
(Well alright!)
Hey ladies (What?)
Do you like those fellas? (You know we do!)
Well you can go downtown
And meet them at the Go Go! (Well alright!)

[Chorus]
It's party time
Woah it's party time
It's party time
Woah it's party time
We live in a party
It's party time
Woah it's party time
It's party time
Woah it's party time
We live in a party
