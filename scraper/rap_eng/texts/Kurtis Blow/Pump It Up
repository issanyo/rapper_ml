Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down

Now stop look and listen and check us out
'Cause we're the Fat Boys and we're gonna shout
At top of our lungs, until we reach our peak
'Cause our jams are strong, never weak
It's time to party, it's time to blink
It's time to get down, it's time to shake
It's time to show you why we rock so well
Because the jams we make are guaranteed to sell
Now there are many other crews that rock the shows
Like Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow
Whodini and The Force MDs
Grandmaster Melle Mel and Run D.M.C
But it's time to show you that we also rock
To feel the funky rhythms all around the block
So just start to rockin' everybody guess what
Homeboys and girls, we're gonna pump it up, ha!

Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down

Now you walk into the party, the place is jumpin'
Everyone is rockin', their bodies are pumpin'
You feel a certain somethin', to move your butt
From side to side, with the cut
You feel the release of so much grief
You don't have to sit around baby here's the beef
'Cause I'm gonna get on the floor, do my thing
And if I have to wobble then I'm gonna swing
'Cause I'm gonna serve me a freak like this and that
Serve her from the front, side and back
I'm gonna catch me a beat and keep that pace
Giggle and wiggle while I rock the place
Punch up something, to keep us going
Swaying to the side while the beat is flowing
Forget the emotions that you're showing
Hurry up, get funky while the beat is growing

Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down

Now I'm pumpin' it live, and tickle your brain
And when I finish rappin' you won't be the same
'Cause the bass is soothing, keeps your ground moving
And once you get started, you can't stop grooving
A taste of the trebles, on the right level
Funky fresh beat, a definite mellow
Chief dominator, rap innovator
Servin' MCs just like Darth Vader
Kool Rock SKi to keep the party jumpin'
If I deflate, I keep on pumpin'
Pumpin' up the party with the rhymes I say
Keep the girls on tip with no delay
'Cause the beat is on, cause much attraction
Never gets dull, always full of action
I get [?] while only in your dreams
Kool Rock Ski, all of y'all gonna see

Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down

Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
Let's get funky, get on down
