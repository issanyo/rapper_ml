Wait a minute, wait a minute! Rolling over the crest of the hill like a
Jet-propelled job comes
Kurt-Kurt-Kurtis Blow
Our parties are def and the girlies are pretty
In the boogie-down Bronx town in New York City
Like the sun will shine in the summertime
I don't do no crimes 'cause I just rhyme
I drive a Benz and I got a lot of friends
Up on the Concourse where Tremont ends
Or Jerome Avenue or Gun Hill Road
The place where rap started in the days of old
Called the Bronx
The Bronx
The Bronx
Hey Moe!
I have the Power
Coitainly!
The Bronx is the place where the Yankees play
We fans have the fever to the break of day
In '76 we used to have big fun
Chilling at the club 371
Blacks, Puerto Ricans, Italians and Jews
Bronx River Casanovas and the Ninth Crew. (called)
The Bronx is the place where I reside
I'll be a Bronx boy 'til the day I die
It's called the Bronx
The Bronx
The Bronx
Lotta ducks out in the pond. Ducks sure take to the water like, uh, ducks!
Hey! What's going on here? Suddenly I'm swimming in the air with a rope
Around my foot!
