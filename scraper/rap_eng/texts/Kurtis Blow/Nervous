[Intro]
You talkin' to me? You make me nervous

[Verse 1]
Now my generation
Has got this inclination
To think this ain't the land of milk and honey
Misiles every place
Can destroy the human race
And everyone is cryin' for more money
There's an actor and a spy
Who can't see eye to eye
Well who gives them the right to run the place?
There are brother's who are sisters
And misses who are misters
And things keep fallin' down from outer space

[Chorus]
And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous

[Verse 2]
Corporate leaders smokin' joints
Big time athletes shavin' points
And all the time they do it with a smile (Smile)
Middle class communters
Stealin' millions with computers
And they might just get probation for a while
But for ordinary folk
The legal's system's just a joke
They're laughin' from New York to the coast
They bargain on the plea
And the lawyer gets his fee
And everybody's happy
Well, almost

[Chorus]
And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous

[Verse 3]
If you're not a lazy slob
You go lookin' for a job
But I hope that you ain't lookin' in Detroit
Where they used to make cars
All they do is hit the bars
'Cause the Japanese have markets to exploit
The rich keep getting richer
Drink Martinis by the pitcher
While the rest of us are lookin' for a break
We play lotto and the number
While the politicians slumber
'Cause the politicians know it's all fake

[Chorus]
And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous
Really makes me nervous

[Verse 4]
The meaning is right here
Mr. Nixon made it clear
Make sure you hit record when you roll the tape
The stuff that gets leftover
Might just keep you out the clover
And you'll never, ever make your great escape
So I hope you've learned the lesson
It's the message of the session
You can take it, but you got to take it slow
Keep it cool and keep it clean
Do it all behind the scene
And if they ask you, just tell 'em you don't know

[Outro]
And everybody says they want to serve us
But the only thing they do is make me nervous
Really makes me nervous (Wo!)
Nervous, nervous (Oh, you make me nervous)
Nervous, nervous (All the time, always nervous)
Nervous, nervous (Oh, you make me nervous)
Nervous, nervous (All the time, you want to serve us)
Uh! Get down, huh!
Just make me nervous
Uh! Get down, hah!
Just make me nervous
Ner, ner-ner-ner-nervous
Uh! Get down!
Nervous, nervous
Nervous, nervous (Nuh-nervous)
Nervous, nervous (Wo!)
