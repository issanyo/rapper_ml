Once a year we celebrate
Washington and Lincoln on their birth dates
And now a third name is added to the list
A man of peace, (Drum Major for Justice)
Now, now, now every January on the third Monday
We pay homage to the man who paved the way
For freedom, justice and equality
To make the world a better place for you and me
It's a holiday, it's a gathering
For the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King

Dr. King tried to love somebody
(Do you wanna love somebody)
For his sake put your hate away, take a day
(Take a day to love somebody)
Don't play on the Holiday, work to find a better way
(Everybody love somebody now)

Oh, everybody sing
For Martin Luther King
Oh, let freedom ring (That's right)
For Martin Luther King, now sing

Holiday! Holiday!
King Holiday!
Not a day just for some
It's a day for everyone

He had a dream now it's up to you
He had a dream now it's up to you
To see it through, to make it come true
Now do it

Who do we thank for teaching us
That we all have the strength to love
Mmm, we thank the Prince of Non-Violence
For showing us the way

How do we show the children of today
How to live together as one
Oh... we'll sing of a King
And his words will light all of our tomorrows

Dr. King tried to love somebody
(Do you wanna love somebody)
For his sake put your hate away, take a day
(Take a day to love somebody)
Don't play on the Holiday, work to find a better way
(Everybody love somebody now)

Oh, everybody sing (Come on)
For Martin Luther King (Ah, yeah)
Oh, let freedom ring (That's right)
For Martin Luther King, now sing
Now do it Listen children of today
Don't think love has gone away
It's in your hearts and minds
(How long) Not long

New day will shine
If we just take the chance
Open up the windows

Let the hero shine
Every day in your life
Yours and mine
Everybody shine, whoa...
Let it shine, let it shine, woo... whoa... oh...

For the future generation, Dr. King's medication
For successful operation is peace for every nation
