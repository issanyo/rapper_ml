(Verse 1)
It was the first of the month and I was on my way
Out of the house to catch the subway
People pushin' and shovin' but I didn't pull rank
Cause I was in a hurry to get to the bank
I walked into the door, what did I see
About 50 people in front of me
Then all of a sudden from out of nowhere
There was a man with a gun, wavin' it in the air
He said this ain't new, ya seen it before
So why don't everybody just hit the floor
He jumped up on the counter said Don't act funny
Just do what I say and fill these bags with money
He was on his way out with all the loot
But the cops were there first, and they started to shoot
They shot him down, straight in the head
Homeboy was stupid, and now he's dead

Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid

Verse 2

There was once a girl, her name was Judy
She was so fine with the big fat booty
But Judy was a kind of stupid girl
Who only liked guys that gave her diamonds and pearls
Material things was all she was after
And if you had the money to hear her laughter
She would laugh in your face and call you a bum
And dis you in the middle like she was dumb
Then late one night, Judy went to the store
To get some bread and milk, and not much more
But on her way back pulled up a Cadillac
It was black on black, and black to be exact
Down came the window then Judy smiled
He whispered in her ear, can you talk for awhile
But Judy said she only liked rich men
But then nobody saw Judy again

Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
(Alright..)

Verse 3

I know a homeboy who like to gamble
But winnin' or (?) his life was in shambles
Blackjack, Poker, Cee-lo, Roulette
7-11 or any kind of bet
One day he went to the track with the daily double
Lost his paycheck (?) in trouble
Cause he didn't buy food for his family to eat
Any clothes for their back or shoes on their feet
So he stayed in the street to make the money back
When he played the numbers and tried a game a blackjack
Some hands win and he couldn't be beaten
But no one knew homeboy was cheatin'
When they found out, and they started to shout
Beat him down cause he had no clout
That's the moral of the story
It may sound gory
Don't ever try to gamble in another territory

Chorus
Stupid. Don't be stupid
Jack Stupid
Don't be stupid
