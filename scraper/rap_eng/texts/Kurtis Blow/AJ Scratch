[Intro]
One, two, three, four, hit it

Three- three- three- three
Four- four- four- four
Hit- hit- hit- hit

[Verse 1: Kurtis Blow]
Up in the Bronx, where the people are fresh
There was one DJ who had to pass the test
And now he's down by law and he's ready to play
That's right, y'all, his name is AJ
Never gets nervous when he cuts the beat
He gets top notch service in the clutch on the street
A complete elite treat that can't be beat
'Cause AJ never knew the agony of defeat
Sing

[Chorus]
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ
Ooh- ooh- ooh- ooh
Kurtis Blow
Ooh- ooh- ooh- ooh- ooh
Kurtis Blow
Ooh- ooh- ooh
Ooh- ooh- ooh

[Verse 2: Kurtis Blow]
Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa
Starsky, Spoonie Gee and Run DMC gotta
Gotta realize that he goes way back
And now he's down with the king
And we could never be wack
So just kick off you shoes and relax your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the Kurtis Blow beat
Yes, yes, y'all and just shake your butt
Because AJ is gonna cut it up
Sing

[Chorus]
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
AJ, I wanna see you
Hit- hit- hit me
Hit- hit- hit me
Hit- hit- hit me
Hit- hit- hit- hit- hit- me
