War

Well, from California to the coast of Maine
From the days of pickin’ cotton and sugar cane
From the mountaintops to the rolling hills
Baseball, hot dogs and all the cheap thrills
There’s New York City and Kalamazoo
White, black, red, yellow and of course the Jew
Democracy is the land of the free
But we’re all gonna die if there’s a World War III!

Lebanon, Beirut, Iraq and Iran
Arabians, Russians don’t like Americans
Revolutionary terrorists swarm like bees
Take American hostages across the seas
But how long Reagan go for that?
Before he really gets mad and then he goes for a bat?

War!
Yes I’m talking World War III!
Destruction! The end of you and me!

Good lord

Old soldiers never die, they just fade away

I see little hope for us

Good lord

Can we solve .. peace?

Can we solve .. love?
