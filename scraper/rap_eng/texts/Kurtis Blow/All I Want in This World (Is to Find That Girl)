[Verse 1]
A cute one, a shy one
A slim one, a sly one
A big one, a small one
A real of the wall one

[Chorus]
All I want in this world is to find that girl

[Verse 2]
A long one, a lean one
A just in between one
A short one, a tall one
I didn't need at all one

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I've searched this fine world over
Tryin' to find someone
A New York to California
On a journey that's only begun
I've been the Maine to Mimphis
The Motor City to LA
And you might think I get this girl is
But I know that I'll find her some day

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Girl I know you out there somewhere and there's one thing I want you to know
I believe that for every man there's a girl and you're the girl for me
And I know it may take a long, long time but I'm gonna get right on tryin'
Bacause you just never ever really know, you may be half-way round the world
Or you may be, you may be right here, right here tonight

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Chorus]
