[Verse 1: Prince Markie Dee]
Now baby listen to what I have to say
And if you don't want to, I'll say it anyway
Now I once had a lady, she was so fly
She was my girl and I was her guy
Now I loved that girl with all my heart
But little by little she would tear it apart
I'm talking ten dollars here, a hundred there
She wasn't ashamed, she'd ask me anywhere
She was one of those girls who didn't give a hoot
And tore my heart from the vine stem and root
Then I met you and you met me
And you're the brand new Ms. Markie Dee
And all I ask is that you treat me right
Through every lasting day and night
And I'll give you what you want
And in the right way
And there's one more thing I have to say

[Hook (4x)]
Don't you dog me
(Human Beatbox barking)

[Verse 2: Kool Rock-Ski]
I'm Kool Rock-Ski the dominating MC
Master of Disaster, the Chief of the East
A lime to a lemon
A lemon to a lime
I'm the MC with the fresh rhymes

And when I'm on stage and ladies screaming for me
Cause I'm the capital K known as Kool Rock-Ski
Better than best I'm MC successor
When I'm on the mic I cause a disaster- Go!

[Hook]
Don't you dog me
(beatbox)
Don't you dog me
(you know I love you-u)
Don't you dog me
(because I'm in love with you)
Don't you dog me
(Hey girl say you want be my girl)
Don't you dog me
(you look so sweet)
Don't you dog me
(and I love you)
Don't you dog me
(beatbox)
Don't you dog me
(I am the Human Beatbox)
