[Intro]
In jail, in jail
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

[Verse 1]
Now there was just one day that I will never forget
I got jailed for something that I'll always regret
It was twelve o'clock, midnight and I wanted a snack
So I headed downstairs, thought the fridge was packed
But when I opened the door, what did I see?
The back of the fridge staring right at me
I thought to myself I could almost die
Then an image appeared, a pizza pie
So I put on Adidas, headed out the door
As I pictured myself eating more and more
But the store was closed, I busted into a rage
So I went to the crib and got my twelve-gauge
Ran back to the shop, busted won the door
And all I saw was pizza galore
So I stuffed my face, I couldn't even walk
I couldn't laugh, smile, shake, giggle, wiggle, or talk
So I fell asleep with my face in my plate
And the next thing you know, I was headed upstate

[Hook]
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

[Verse 2]
Well, Kool Rock is my name, last part is "-Ski"
And I have the worst case of any MC
But listen to the story cause it's kind of strange
When I had this sort of hunger pain
Walking down the street with the bass of my box
With my stomach growling like a hungry fox
When I saw this scene or was it a dream?
A big restaurant sign called Burger King
So I went inside, started stuffing my face
Didn't even think about the things I ate
But when the bill came up, boy, was I shocked
I said, "I don't pay for nothing, I'm the King of the Slops!"

[Hook]
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed

[Verse 3]
But when our time is through, we'll rock you and you
We turn parties out, make you scream and shout
We're not demanding or very outstanding
We got something unique and in the middle he's standing
On the microphone, he rocks and shocks
Homeboys and girls, it's the Human Beat Box

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Now I'm sitting here alone looking at the wall
Just thinking about how I took the fall
I thought I was cool, I thought I was slick
And now I'm writing letters of being homesick
I lost my freedom when I heard the door slammer
And now I'm breaking rocks with a big, heavy hammer
I used to drive the streets with my big car
And now I look and all I see are bars
(In jail) Everyone's the same
You only survive if you play the game
You don't have knives, you don't have guns
And now you remember you're your momma's son
You made her cry and stay up all night
Coming home high, just leaving a fight
You always made her feel that you were better
But now you're a little boy just waiting for a letter

[Hook]
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
In jail, in jail, without no bail
In jail, we're in jail because we failed
