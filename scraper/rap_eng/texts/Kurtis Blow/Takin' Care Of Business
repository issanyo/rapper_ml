They get up every morning
From the alarm clock's warning
Take the 8 15 into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people push and people shove
And all the girls
Who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by 9
And start your slaving job
To get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been
Takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
I've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime
Workout

If things were easy as fishing
You could be a musician
If you could make sounds
Loud or mellow
Get a second hand guitar
Chances are you'll go far
If you get in with
The right bunch of fellows

People see you having fun
Just a-lying in the sun
And tell them that
You like it this way
It's the work that we avoid
And we're all self employed
We love to work at nothing all day

And we've been
Takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
We've been takin' care of business
It's all right
Takin' care of business
And working overtime

Take good care of my business
When I'm away
Everyday

They get up every morning from the alarm clock's warning
Take the eight-fifteen into the city
There's a whistle up above and people push and people shove
And the girls, who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time you can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed look at me I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

They get up every morning
From the alarm clock's warning
Take the 8 15 into the city
There's a whistle up above
And people push and people shove
And all the girls
Who try to look pretty

And if your train's on time
You can get to work by 9
And start your slaving job
To get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

And I've been
Takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
I've been takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime

Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Takin' care of business
Every day
Takin' care of business
Every way
Takin' care of business
It's all mine
Takin' care of business
And working overtime
Takin' care of business
