If I didn't have no dough, would you love meeee?

Now once the night wounds down, and the weed gets low
Players still playin', and I'm still on a float
I groove to the beat, 'til my feet get tired
I just want to be your desire
Eva Knieva, best believe-a
Your not a dime piece, your a diva
Take it from me you can be the, O-N-E
If you roll wit me

[Nelly]
Now if looks was the case, baby girl'll be federal
The top half - incredible, the bottom half - edible (huh)
I ain't telling you what I heard, mayne I'm telling you what I know
And I ain't telling where to stay, or where to go
And, if she, want me, we'll take a trip down, wit the homie
The D-O-double-G
And if I'm lonely, jump from a lil' town
And it's low-key, and guess who wear the crown (Whoo!)

Clap ya hands everybod-y
