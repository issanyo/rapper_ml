[Chorus]
Chill out! Transformers, born to meet the skies
Transformers, born to meet the skies

[Interlude]
T-Bone!, nasty, say what?
Say Go, go, Kurtis Blow y'all
Gimme the bomb!
I'm chillin' haha
Go through it!
Dance!

[Verse 1]
Now the next little item that I wanna discuss is about the sucker rappers
Who must be smokin' dust
When you make the kinda records that diss females – frontin' on a story
When it's just a tall tale
To diss a female is a lowdown shame, but you suckers make the records
Cause you wanna get fame
All you radio cats: don't play that crap. Can't you see they're messin' up
In all the name of the rap
Now all these years rappers worked so hard
To give rapping a name and all you rappers a job
But now you peasy-head B-boys get me upset
When you diss around and cut and then you just defect
Don't forget LaToya and the real Roxanne
Can't you think of something Else, you know what I'm sayin'?
But all you MC's just keep on illin'. That's okay, cause I'm chillin'

[Chorus]
Transformers – Dance! -- born to meet the skies
Transformers – Dance! -- born to meet the skies
I'm chillin'
Gimme the bomb!

[Verse 2]
Now wherever you go, I just want you to know
That I'm running the show, at twenty below
So let me tell you what it takes since the others are fake
It must've been a mistake but those are the breaks
I'm a Leo the Lion, the lion with desire, when I'm rappin' on the mic I set the world on fire
Devastatin', motivatin', complicatin', perpatratin' rappers who want to be, on top
Stop! Can't you see me in trouble bo? It's rockin' the spot, yeah!
And don't you ever forget it trooper! Workin' all day, it's time for
Superman just to give you a break
Along with a go-go band, yes yes y'all. Can't you understand? What's the
Name of this jam?
I'm chillin'

[Outro]
Get funky
To the bridge!
Get ready for it y'all. Get ready baby
Awright y'all. Awright. Here we go y'all
Here I go, here I go y'all. Say what?
I said dance! I'm chillin'
