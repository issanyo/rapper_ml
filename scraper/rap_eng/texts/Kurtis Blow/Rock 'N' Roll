Sound like a fat grippin' it

We are The Fat Boys!
And we wanna kick it
Well why you wanna kick it?
Who are we? Who are we?
We are The Fat Boys!
You wanna slide?
And we're not gonna take it no more!
We are The Fat Boys!
And we're not gonna take it no more!
Who are we?
We are The Fat Boys!
I said, and we are not gonna take it no more!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Prince Markie Dee, make your body rock
And I still got the same old [?]
Kool Rock-Ski, big and strong
To you sucker MCs this is our song
And the Human Beat Box, and once, twice, thrice
But otherwise known as Doctor Nice
Don't do that mic, the rhymes we write
And if you try to recite then we'll have to come fight
And do not forget the words that we speak
'Cause all of them strong, none of them weak
So just put your hands together and clap to the rap
And if you feel that rhythm let your fingers snap
'Cause feelin' the rock is all you need to know
And if it's fast you clap, it'slow you blow
'Cause the ladies of the way, [?] turn it out
It's an electric thrill, whoever shock the house

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Now we're takin' control, and even command
Well we can crush sucker MCs in the palm of my hand
We capitate their heads and throw them into the sea
'Cause I'm Prince (and I'm Kool) we're in the place to be
Now there's a lot of talk about the things we've eaten
But on the microphone we've never been beaten
[?] the Prince and I will state my name
But I'll never let another MC put me to shame
See I've traveled the world on a steady crew
I got the words to make you move
Just give me the mic, it's that I'll shock
I'm the dominator, and my name is Kool Rock
United we'll stand, divided we'll fall
Toppling us like a great big wall
The mic is my gun, the voice ammunication
To the sucker MCs we're the only competition
So feel the [?] when it hits the skin
'Cause when we're in a battle, we always win!
Your future's been decided, so take a rest
'Cause we're The Fat Boys and we are the best

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

[Beatboxing]

Now we can rock real loud, rap real low
We can rock real fast, or rap real slow
But any way you put it, we still rock def
Rock up and down, right to left
From a little house party to a very big jam
All we need is a stage and mic in hand
And one to a million, people to shock
But the [?] we just plain rock
Now our rock is complete, a devastating feat
And now you could head back to your seat
But before you do that, throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em around like you just don't care
Now you heard our little test, you listened to the best
I pass the mic [?] gonna finish the rest
Now your [?] over, your body relieved
And rest assured you know that we...

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!

Rock!
And roll!
