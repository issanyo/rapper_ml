[Verse 1]
You're all broke down, you're all depressed
You got no money to pay your debts
The biggest debt that you got
Is you gotta pay the boys from down the block
And they don't care about the worries you have
They only care about their own behalf
You never know where they may show
But one thing I do know, the boys are cold

[Verse 2]
So you walk around, smoke big cigars
Wear diamond rings, drive fancy cars
You think you're cool, you think you're good
You're gonna pay one day, you big time hood

[Verse 3]
You won't walk the street
The cops won't walk their beat
'Cause you know better than I
They don't want to die
Now that it's understood
Pray to god and knock on wood
This world's ruled for good
This world's gone for good

By the big, the big, the big, the big time
The big, the big, the big, the big time hood
Big , the big, the big, the big time
You're gonna get it good, uh-uh
You big time hood

[Verse 4]
So you'll jump in the car, you leave this place
You end up in another state
When you get out the car, you turn around
You're about to faint and hit the ground
'Cause a mirage it is not
It's one of the boys from down the block
With an open hand he say "Gimme the key!"
He smacks your face when you said please
You're lucky that he let's you go
'Cause one thing I do know
The boys are cold
