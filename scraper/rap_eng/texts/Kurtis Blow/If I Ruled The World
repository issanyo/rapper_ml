[Hook]
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, "The King is here!"
So I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, "Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, so goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party"
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: "La-Di-Da-Di"
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and voters too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passed I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeahhhhh)

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'mma rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love and happiness
In a world of peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (yeahhhhh)

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (if I ruled the world)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
