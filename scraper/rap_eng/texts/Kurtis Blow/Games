[Verse 1]
This is where the story begins
Her name's Beverly, in the hills is where she's forever been
She wants to explore so the young lady starts to indulge in sins
Rolling with her crew, ran a choo choo in the back seat
Of the train, what the hell was on her brain
Cause she wants a little fame
All the niggas to know her name, she could never know
Walking down the road in the morning it was four, leaning off the blow
Same niggas run up on her now she's raped left on the floor
What to do but see a doctor
Cannot tell her parents she ain't seen them since the foster
Doc said check back in a few months
Stressed and steady hitting these blunts
And on top of that none of her homies hit her back, not once
Lonely in the ruts, no money coming through
Now she's at you, bless who?
He said Bev you better work
Whether you slang it on the low or fuck it
Learn to twerk, pride tuck it
It's money first, don't ruck it she'll end up hurt
Easy on the eyes, speech smooth so eloquent
Hit it from above, thinking something like the president
Out committing sins still preaching like a reverend
It's like going in for surgery when they ain't got no sedative
Got to make it on her own cause she really got no relatives
Say cash rules everything, so the consequence irrelevant
Which ironic cause the way she do it so benevolent
But he got her out here working knowing damn well that's she pregnant
It's the

Games people play (x4)

[Verse 2]
She's sick and it's just sickening
Look at them and they're bickering
Wobbling wibbling, winter kicking it in her Timberlands
Breast feeding her little martian
No milk in the carton, people starting to
Fuss and grumble, evolution's a lie we still live in the jungle
Fiends begging all she hearing is mumbles
Supply dry, she tumbles down the stairs
She fumbles courage, left in despair
But all is fair in love and war
Feel it in her core like the son she just bore
Said her hours need more
Put him to sleep wait for the snore
And grabbed the pistol out the drawer, soar
Over to the spot, two pops in his top make his head rock
Cops in pursuit, she got the loot
Heart beating, breathing fast like she plays the flute
Players salute, in cahoots with none
Cold like a tundra, under the influence
Numb to the fact that her son will be tossed back to the system
Made to bend and twist him
Don't pay attention the rhythm but message within them
Doesn't matter wrong or right
She'll see him in twenty-five to life
But really guess it's just the
