[Chorus]
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out

[Verse]
Never mind all this gun talk
I got two [?]
I don't like to talk
Y'all some fuckin' cops
If you run up
You gon' get gun shots
Watch me run up on your squad and lay it down
Got a big bammer, call it [?]

[Chorus]
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
I'm a real shooter, I don't need no beam nigga
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
Run up on my squad you gon' get laid out
