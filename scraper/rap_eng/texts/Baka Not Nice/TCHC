[Chorus]
I'm in metro housing baby, we had no food in the refrigerator
When I pop that oven for some fuckin' heat
Ain't no countin' the next time we gon' eat
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, how you think you gon' motherfuckin' play me?
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, I'm no dirt kid, is you fucking crazy?

[Verse 1]
After I turned the age of twelve, my OG had me in the trap choppin up the scale
Now we had no fuckin carrot man, we used a coat hanger, that was my town
Yeah
I paid my dues in these streets
I'm on beast mode nigga, they ain't test me
Cause trappin' is a hobby
I got a couple fiends waiting in my lobby
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in metro housing baby, we had no food in the refrigerator
When I pop that oven for some fuckin' heat
Ain't no countin' the next time we gon' eat
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, how you think you gon' motherfuckin play me?
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, I'm no dirt kid, is you fucking crazy?

[Verse 2]
We out here serving ninety-nine
I got my youngens in the trap bussin' down a nine
A couple grown niggas still choppin' dimes
All my OGs dead, or they doing time
Cause these fuckboys out here dropping dimes
You can kick rocks bitch, you ain't no friend of mine
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm in metro housing baby, we had no food in the refrigerator
When I pop that oven for some fuckin' heat
Ain't no countin' the next time we gon' eat
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, how you think you gon' motherfuckin' play me?
Yeah
I'm in metro housing baby, I'm no dirt kid, is you fucking crazy?
