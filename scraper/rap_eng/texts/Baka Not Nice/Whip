That fish, water whip
She took a trip, we in the six
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks
My bricks, now she whip my bricks
My bricks, now she whip my bricks
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks, yeah, yeah
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks

[Verse 1]
Yo it’s not nice
He don’t got no chill
To be honest
You could grow on bill
My whole life
I kept that shit trill
If you run up
I make your blood spill
I’ma shit
I just popped a pill
Sent my nigga home
Fresh off bail
Already in the kitchen whippin’ up the scale
You ain’t hear we weigh that weight
On magic scale

[Hook]
That fish, water whip
She took a trip, we in the six
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks
My bricks, now she whip my bricks
My bricks, now she whip my bricks
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks
I took your bitch, now she whip my bricks

[Verse 2]
As a youngin’
They say you’d amount to nothing
Copped my first [?]
Before Easter Sunday
When you get thirteen
Ain’t no time for talking
If you [?] roof
You better get to walking
Got some youngins
Yeah, they with the barking
In my fitted
Turnt up for all-star weekend
Just remember
Ain’t no long talking
Just remember
Ain’t no long talking
