[Chorus]
Junior high I kept a tech 'round
I slap my burner, got respect now
Niggas never played around
I'm on Billboard cashing checks now
Junior high I kept a tech 'round
I slap that burner, no regrets now
Yeah, niggas never played around
I'm on Billboard cashing checks now

[Verse 1]
Flipping, running these Percs now
No need flipping all these birds now
Sippin' OJ, poppin' Percs now (yeah)
I'm so high, I have no feelings now (huh, yeah, yeah)
I feel like ooh-oo-oo
Diamonds dripping, lean like ooh-oo-oo (yeah)
We don't play them fucking games (yeah)
We don't talk to fucking lames

[Chorus]
Junior high I kept a tech 'round
I slap my burner, got respect now
Niggas never played around
I'm on Billboard cashing checks now
Junior high I kept a tech 'round
I slap that burner, no regrets now
Yeah, niggas never played around
I'm on Billboard cashing checks now

[Verse 2]
You wanna be industry (yeah)
I get love in the street
I've got security, he follow me (yeah)
You call her wifey, but she DM me (yeah)
Getting money, I don't play around
I keep big wads in my pocket now
I count a hundred 'cause I'm poppin' now (yeah)
I don't drive, I take car service now
Ain't no flipping 'cause no birds, ain't no birds
Ain't no flipping 'cause no birds, now (brrrrr)
Got a payroll and it's heavy now
R.I.P. Fifty bro

[Chorus]
Junior high I kept a tech 'round
I slap my burner, got respect now
Niggas never played around
I'm on Billboard cashing checks now
