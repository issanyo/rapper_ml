[Hook: Hypa]
Don't Par with a broke boy
If it's more money it's a go boy
Add it up and flip it up that spatula
Get it how we get it so they mad at us
Ninety-Nine problems but my lady drama
Coulda dicked down on your baby mama
Sipping in jacuzzis living cozy now
Make a lot of plays watch us throw it down

[Verse 1: Hypa]

Make a lot of plays watch us throw it down
Rent a couple condos watch me own it now
They freed us look i got my broski now
Hold a lot of weight but we hold it down
I love designer, i don't care what it cost
My balling on heat compared to Chris Bosh
Kick up in a foreign just got my shit washed
Skrt by and the kitties stare at my car
I spend a lot of bands on my feet
Your bitch mind strong but i got her weak
Lay that money on my tongue then i tweak
If it's money yeah i speak
Then fuck it, we can speak

[Hook: Hypa]
Don't Par with a broke boy
If it's more money it's a go boy
Add it up and flip it up that spatula
Get it how we get it so they mad at us
Ninety-Nine problems but my lady drama
Coulda dicked down on your baby mama
Sipping in jacuzzis living cozy now
Make a lot of plays watch us throw it down

[Verse 2: Baka]
Since a youngin i've been hold it down
On the corner tryna bust a brick down
Mamma told me don't be a waste man
Stack your chips high like a airplane
On the 4 out by the play now
That's when i caught my first trade pound
All you fuck niggas gon see me now
And all your bad bicthes gon want me now
Don't run up when you see me now
Imma big nigga with a lotta clout
Nigga say Baka rich now
Cause i'm riding in the six with drizzy now

[Hook: Hypa]
Don't Par with a broke boy
