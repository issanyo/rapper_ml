[Verse 1]
I got the baddest bitch and she give me top (ew, ew)
She workin' like magic when she give me top (ew, ew)
When I bend her over, she beggin' don't stop (ew, ew)
We keep it down low, she don't wanna get caught

[Chorus]
Baby girl, you know you cream of the crop
Only let bad bitches ride in my drop
I feed all my soldiers so they make the wars
I'm bangin' on track so we end up on top (said I'm bangin', Milli, gyah)
