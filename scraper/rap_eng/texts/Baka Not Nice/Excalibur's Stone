Composer Bulldozer
Fleet-footed, I kick a flow type Bettis
I toss fluid swearin you the sewer
Washed up, what I drew tough
Spit angry like ya new shoes scuffed
Act like ya knew us
Uhh, mental mind the illest
Was bread where the killas be
Was told to think BIG, can't live with limitations
Pen it lemony for they faces
Public Enemy brazen
Puff good the graceland
Remember gettin maced, annnnnnd
Them same hours had my Uncle pass
Valentine's formaldehyde
Put it in your frame when you die
Separate from the plain that you rise
A closed casket
Word to Crystal Seth
"Put My Ash To The Sky"
Yo, how did this happen?
Outspoken when I be rappin
Turn corners I'm with my faction
Big buckshots, ya back flip
Slayin entertainers on some rap shit
Y'all act sick
But couldn't catch a cold if you tried
Related to what Mulder said he saw up in the sky
I ain't from round here
Animated dummy
Spewing rhythms and they sound weird, (Huh?!?)
Starseed, far reach, call me Lennox Lewis
Snake bite when I write it'll stop your movement
Strap the muzzle on me, guarantee I'm chewing through it
My main concern is making great music
People persist, refute the fact that they should do it
Got the nerve to send me spam
Call them niggas Bland Vann Damne
Aiming for ya head just like Cass
Got hate yes
Pull me down I'm weightless
Tune up your style, it needs maintenance
See now it requires diligence and patience
Bound for a certain destination
My spittin' remains latent
Consolidating flows making new flame statements
Chef Rick Ramsay, you know I souffle the makeshift
Chill with them wack ass bars
Erase em, too basic
Waiting for it to fall in your lap, take it
S'Why I hit that mic like the town, straight ragin
Divie out intelligence from madness I was raised in
Had me bringing quarters back, head swivilin like Peyton's
Manning up for revolution
Plan it out
So how we do it?
Disclose that later, wins like the showtime Lakers
Advanced courses when canoeing
Keep Your Grades Up
Uhh
Excalibur is what I pulled from the stone
I'm just a sharpened young wordsmith
Holdin his own
Yo!

DC:

Dang man
They got me back in here...
Wearing purple
Smoking purple
Drinking purple
....Huh? Ya know? Let's go!

Eating crab all day
Stomach full of Old Bay
Top notch pack
It can't go another way
I be sittin back chillin smokin good Mary Jane
Might get a call from shorty say she wanna give brain
I tell her don't forget ya friend that go the other way
I jump in and splash on em
Back to gettin cake
I'm a lion huntin
You a clown and monkey
Bet your stomach feelin funny
You ain't out here gettin money
Ya girl want a teddy bear, I'm out to get her honey
She know the tune to every song
She in the bed hummin
Twerkin, suckin, humpin, that her main function
Taught these niggas so much, I son em
I'm Phillip Drummond
Might hit the stage live
Give the drummer somethin
I'm shining out here like the rising sun or something
The Son of Sam
I'm killin these niggas, they like, "Damn!"
Ehhh....
