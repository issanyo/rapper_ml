[Chorus]
She wanna fuck with the squad (shooter)
She say you niggas ain't hard (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm in the foreign body (woo), I got that thirty on me (thirty, thirty)
I slip in the party (gyah), I dare a nigga test me (gyah)
I might just teach 'em lesson, I might just give the Wesson (gyah, gyah)
I might just call this bitch (woo), she might just call up her best friend (call her)
I'm in the trap with my dawg, he got the pole by the entrance (pow, pow)
I had to switch up my dance, I might just grip with my left hand (gyah, gyah)
Whip,-whippin' it raw, sh-sh-shippin' it all (ship, ship)
Say she real, she down to catch a charge

[Chorus]
She wanna fuck with the squad (shooter)
She say you niggas ain't hard (yeah)
Might cop this Benz for my dawg (yeah)
Jump in the Benz and we gone (yeah)

They wan' fuck, come to my loft (yeah)
Gotta watch out for these broads (yeah)
Gotta watch out for the law (woo, woo)
She wanna fuck with the squad (yeah)
She say you niggas ain't hard (yeah)
Might cop this Benz for my dawg (woo)
Jump in the Benz and we gone (yeah)
Bitch I'm a dog, watch me ball (gyah)

[Verse 2]
I got the clout, so my name in your mouth
Trippin' and nippin' and servin' before I was twelve (yeah)
Birds in the couch (yeah), I'm the man of the house (yeah)
I'm good with the plug, it don't matter, my nigga, we handle them all (serve, serve)
I was sixteen when I copped the beam (yeah)
Pull up on you, nigga (yeah), thank you for your tings (aye)
And I walk in the [?] whippin' soft in the bowl (gyah)
Niggas ain't up to par (gyah), only want that million (gyah)

She wanna fuck with the squad (shooter)
She say you niggas ain't hard (yeah)
Might cop this Benz for my dawg (yeah)
Jump in the Benz and we gone (yeah)
Bitch I'm a dog, watch me ball (yeah)
They wan' fuck, come to my loft (yeah)
Gotta watch out for these broads (yeah)
Gotta watch out for the law (bow, bow)
She wanna fuck with the squad (bow)
She say you niggas ain't hard (woo)
Might cop this Benz for my dawg (yeah, woo)
Jump in the Benz and we gone (gyah, gyah, gyah)
