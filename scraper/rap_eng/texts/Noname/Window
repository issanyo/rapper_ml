[Intro: Noname]
Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me

[Verse 1: Noname]
Here with him a little ways from now, empty
Everything we ever was was empty
Empty fucking, cussing, I know I'm your bitch
But you're my bitch too, making money little TM
DM your resume to industry
Sympathy held you down, down down, we love you
Ain't nobody around, masquerade like I'm empty
Empathy was empathy only when you was into me
Kiss me back to savior
Happy, happy
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
Laffy taffy, daffy ducky, fucky all around
Fuck me on the ground, fuck me in the bed too
Skip, love me with your eyes closed, cigarette, cruise ship
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
This song gon' make me go fuck your daddy
This song the reason I be cleaning 'fore I send him the addy
This like a remedy for nothingness, me frenchin' a tabby

[Pre-Hook: Noname]
Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me
Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me

[Hook: Phoelix]
Quit looking out the window, go find yourself
Gon get the bag with your kinfolk, don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window, go find yourself
Gon get the bag with your kinfolk, don't doubt your wealth

[Verse 2: Noname]
I knew you never loved me but I fucked you anyway
I guess a bitch like to gamble, I guess a bitch like to lonely
Oooh niggas know me, God atone me
Oh I'm really feeling like I made this bitch
I know that's my ego, I know I'm just empty
The sentiment for the people
This sacrifice for my wholesome, I'm bought the church for the steeple
I bought you Game 5 tickets, made my pussy the sequel
So you really don't think about me?
And you really don't miss me?
The way I lullaby your brokenness, believe me I'm Ripley
The way you struggling to love yourself, believe me that's karma
You want a nasty bitch, psychiatrist that cook like your mama
And all you got was me-me-me
But I love you even though we're not meant to be, I still love you
I hope you find everything that you want, and she loves you
Everything is everything just know that I love you

[Hook: Phoelix]
Quit looking out the window, go find yourself
Come get the bag with your kinfolk, don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window, go find yourself
Come get the bag with your kinfolk
