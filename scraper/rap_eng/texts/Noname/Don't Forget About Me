[Verse 1]
Your family looking like a prayer song
Your momma at the table cryin
All her hair gone
Feeling fishy Finding Chemo
Smoking seaweed for calm
These Disney movies too close
You title email "Noname thank you for your sweet Telefone
It saves lives"
The secret is I'm actually broken
I tried to raise a healing kneeling at the edge of the ocean
Somebody, somebody said it saves lives
Who holds my hand tonight? I think the glass half full
Who pray me back to Inglewood, I shouldn't bleed this good Holy conundrum
I'm the prayer, the hope, bank account wishin' bone for my loved ones
Tell ‘em Noname still don’t got no money
Tell 'em Noname almost passed out drinking
Secret is, she really think it saves lives
Somebody hit D'Angelo, I think I need him on this one
Brothers and sisters, mommas, cousins, uncles, everyone
Missing somebody
Dancing daylight

[Hook]
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my daddy don't forget about me

[Verse 2]
Let's get down to the nitty gritty, changed my city
Titties 13k, the pretty costs these days
My doctor really love me, how I'm only half awake
I just came from the funeral, my ugly passed away
Welcome to Beverly Hills
Welcome to Vicodin, I took the pills
I think they save lives
I just hope that they right
All I am is everything and nothing at all
All I am is shoulder for your heart to lean on
All I am is love, all I am is love

[Hook]
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
