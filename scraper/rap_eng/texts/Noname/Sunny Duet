[Chorus: TheMIND]
Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I’m not around

[Verse 1: Noname]
I used to have a name that look like butterflies and Hennessey
I'd trade it up for happiness but joyful don't remember me
I'm sitting on my front lawn waiting for him to call me
He said he knew my name
Shame on me, fool me once, shame on you
I got my candy cane, my name is hella pimping too
You could watch a player move
Oh we could call this ice cream on my Sunday sweater
Patent leather tethered to a fancy car
I know you wanna touch me in your old religion caviar
Holy water avatar, blue like the tears when I left you
I met you on Saturday morning
It's raining, it's storming
I approach me with caution, I come with a warning

[Verse 2: TheMIND]
If you sweep me off my feet
I'll probably clean my act up
I swear I'll be on my best behavior
From this day forward, a lifetime after
If you're my baby
And I know this world is so damn crazy
(And I know this world is oh so crazy)
But that don't mean a thing
You can forget me, hate me, call me crazy
As long as you know my name

[Verse 3: Noname]
I use to dream in parables, partially love you naturally
Happily ever after, cigarettes over blunts now
Miracle Whip at Funtown, summertime delight, delight
Mississippi over ice, Janet Jackson and flashing lights
We can dance a little, if you'd like to
My vagabonds is a lonely road, a celebrated haiku
Contemporary overzealous think I really like you
Sing with me, sing with me paranoia light blue
Piano was a deep red, your fingers were a green hue
I should make a rainbow out of sacrificial love in the club
Off the ollie ollie, feeling holy
The DJ was religion, I swear on the Pope he know me

[Chorus: TheMind]
Name is just a name
But don't call me crazy
Rain don't feel like rain
It's been so calming lately
Love is just a word, unless you show it
So tell me, what you call me when I’m not around
