[Hook: Joseph Chilliams]
If you always speaking from the soul, that shit ain't gon' sell, my nigga
Collard greens in my bowl, that shit ain't no kale, my nigga
Put money on Jimmy phone when there ain't no bail, my nigga
Label after my soul, you know I ain't gon' sell, my nigga
If you always speaking from the soul, that shit ain't gon' sell, my nigga
Collard greens in my bowl, that shit ain't no kale, my nigga
Put money on Jimmy phone when there ain't no bail, my nigga
Label after my soul, you know I ain't gon' sell, my nigga

[Verse 1: Noname]
Uh
They say I'm not turnt enough, don't go to church enough
Telling my mama I need it
Gypsy No-na-me believed it and [tweeted/tweet it?]
The industry don't fuck with me and it's laughable
They wish my music was taxable
Slaves to the companies labeling luxuries
Ooh they so masterful, look at they dynasty
Built on the backs of the artists in line with me
Come stand in line with me
Fuck these label executives
How they gon' tell me my excellence
Loud in the background of blogs, steady hecklin'
"Noname's a one hit wonder"
Oh really, I am?
So you a taste maker for culture you don't have
Calling yourself a renaissance man?
We invented jazz jazz
We invented cash flow in y'all economy
Dark anomaly, booty-clappin' on niggas
Counting up figures like Jigga-man
I am a black goddess
Imperial wonderland
New dimensional reasons for finding myself
Removed from my African

[Verse 2: Joseph Chilliams]
Bringing sexy back like a shower scene starring yours truly
All them goofy's say we'd never win
Always put that shit on element
Niggas never wanna see me hoopin'
Know I got the chopper like I'm Cody Banks
In the crib but my woadie ain't
Free my niggas like it's juneteenth
Sending kites like I'm Ben Frank
Hold me down, I been losing homies like I'm switching schools in the fourth grade
Syncing Google Calendar with court dates
Give a fuck about a cosign
Good without it like Lebron hair
I can never sell my soul
Rather lose my manhood on a lawn chair making good music
Like when Common [let me?] try to steal my youth
Like Madonna breath
On my momma I been tryna find nirvana in the diamond powder since when Jimmy left
Still good in the hood like... so-so def
Drop a solo with no more guests
Want me to hold my breath for a Bow-Wow feature and keep my logos fresh
Fuck Bow-Wow

If you always speaking from the soul, that shit ain't gon' sell, my nigga

[Verse 3: Supa Bwe]
New greenroom who dis who are you?
Only day ones and a couple day twos, black youth
A reckless weapon destined to transmute
Hatred into blessings
Speak from the soul, dance lil mama
I got places to go, got plans lil mama
So roll up and smoke, grass lil mama
You know what I want, some ass lil mama
Periscoping, hanging, I can't tell the difference
That's how you know a nigga living
Criss crossing globe like baseball stages
Going back and forth, no politickin'
And he sipping, real nigga, mint condition
My sauce on my chicken, that's law
White man mad, not my fault
My watermelon better with all that salt
