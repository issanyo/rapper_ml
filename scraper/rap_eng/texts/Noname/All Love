I wonder if the money I made changed you
I wonder if you look at me the same
I don't need your validation
Im a black bird with no name
Im free

It's all love It's all love
It's all love It's all love
It's all love It's all love
It's all love It's all love
Im Free

So um apparently a lion can have sex more than 50 times a day (Ey)
But funny fact is my father Mufasa this saga to short
Lets write a different chapter
Lets go to the church and let's meet john the baptist
Get it crackin
He had a little cousin
Who wrote a killer blue print
And baby we should use it
I don't even smoke marijuana I just abuse the music
My existence maybe to confusing but before you lose it
If we look into the future
I spit one rap
You unpack in my apartment two years later
But then we subtract cause we didn't get along
But three months pass and you come back to figure it out
But we ain't figure it out
But since we done that
You just a teacher and I'm a rapper that's unsigned
But with one rhythm we can try to reinvent sunshine
You worried about being hurt cause you think I'm a lame
You think i'm gonna shot you cause you think I'm a lame
But the first bulletproof vest was invented by a women
See you probably didn't even know that I just put you on game
And I just think its a shame that niggas stuck in a trance
Like Mary had a son but they denying my man
And I don't know everything
But even if I missed a lay-up Taylor Bennett right behind me to alley-oop for the slam
And me and NoName at the pentagon sketching these plans to take over the world
For no reason just to say that we can

Ive got no time for the rain in the middle of summer
They say they want much more, much more I give up my slumber
Im out of my mind to high and they say my hours are numbered
I should have told you to listen
You should have told me start running, running
Feet breaking, dreams vacant, life changing so ancient
Need a vacation
Run-a-way slave from the corporation
Hard to think in incarceration
Heart be racing altercation
I caught a case of suitcase vacation
Im running away from a lot of things
Do you ever think about the world and
How I'm trapped on the map
With a backpack and a snapback
I mean snap back shits changed
Everybody wanna get on top
Everybody wanna take a shot
Everybody wanna get a shot
Crabs in the bucket get me a shrimp
Niggas go ain't but I ain't no chip
I ain't no chump, no bitch, no punk
Bitch ass niggas don't want no smoke
Don't know what I wrote
Killed that illed that
You should feel and still if not
Your ass is getting stained
You know the name you know the game
Find me in the hall of fame
Rolling loud and blowing on that fire flame
My Nigga
