[Intro]
It by the way Tentacion sang on that.....khmmmmm

[Verse 1]
Tell me why did you do this
After all, she herself and without knocking came into my house
I did not ask for myself the poet's suffering
But you promised to sing a song together

[Verse 2]
Tell me why did you do this
After all, she herself and without knocking came into my house
I did not ask for myself the poet's suffering
But you promised to sing a song together

[Outro]
Together-together, together-together, together-together, together-together, together-together......
