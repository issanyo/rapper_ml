(Woman talking)
She’s so caught up buying tomorrow
And I just wanna make a day
He got us caught up pullin’ the sorrow
When all we do is make a way

[Chorus]
We should be into you
So good to you
I know, I know, I know
‘Cause I am so into you, so into you
I know for sure , I know (oh)
If my [?] so
[?] and diamonds
Would she have been this beautiful
No I can’t imagine
Don’t go around no angels
Unless like you they scanned it glow
It could be so easy
To let them get you
Drowning in material

[Verse 2]
No it never make no sense to me
You will always royalty
Fine through a [?]
She’s so caught up buying tomorrow
And I just wanna make a day
He got us caught up pullin’ the sorrow
When all we do is make a way

[Chorus]
We should be in to you
So good to you
I know, I know, I know
‘Cause I am so into you, so into you
I know for sure , I know (oh)

[Bridge]
She’s lost in the age of livin’ forever
He’s stuck in the age of needing’ forever
But you never, never , never see it all
Oh you can never, never , never live it all

[Verse 2]
I am so into you
My beautiful darling
The day that we ate forbidden fruit
After the interview you said that you knew me
Interlude intimate, lilacs and rubies
Tangible joyfulness kisses and matches
Matching my laugh
It's contagious and rapid
You lady your guyses will love you
My God it’s the only above you
Like it’s a summer tree
Some will imagine us
Sacrifice kickin’ my synergy
Fold of the section of sanity
Endless donation secure your everything

[Outro]
Seeing off
We should be into you
So into you
I know, I know, I know
‘Cause I am so into you, so into you
I know for sure, I know (oh)
