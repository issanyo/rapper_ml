[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay

[Verse 1: Ravyn Lenae]
How's it feel to be on my mind?
I can't believe I found you in time
I had a dream across seas for you and me
Sun ray on my lap, I love it on my back
Oh sweet bae holy sun
Oh future husband, undress me under the moon
Sweet bae someday will come soon

[Chorus: Ravyn Lenae]
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay

[Verse 2: Noname]
My lil' baby wanna smoke with me, dread head in a party getting close to me
Said hol' up, slow up, roll up, roll up, dance slow, baby, dance slow, baby smoke
Niggas off the gasoline, smoking backwoods in the backwoods, living lavishly
Ooh ooh, that's my Montego Bae
I know my nigga like me, I know he cook his curry spicy
I know he eat me like I'm wifey, he know my hotel over pricey
So he gon' fuck me like I'm Oprah, classy bitch only use a coaster
Now I'm swimmin' in the money with a ducky or 2
Reading Toni Morrison in a nigga canoe
'Cause a bitch really 'bout her freedom 'cause a bitch suckin dick in the new Adidas
And yes and yes, I'm problematic too
And yes and yes, I lick 'em up, oh yes I really do
Protection is a wave, wave 'cause we be open too
Jamaica thank you for my baby, I'm in love wit' you
