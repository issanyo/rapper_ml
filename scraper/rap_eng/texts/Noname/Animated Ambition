[Intro]
Can you turn the beat up a little bit more in my headphones?
Yeah...
Runnit'

[Chorus : theMIND]
When I was young
Thought I'd grow up, be a cartoon (cartoon)
Used to be Rugrat
Now I'm black Tommy Pickles
Trapped up in the costume (costume)
Trying to get out of that pardon my reach
But I need to change the channel
Non eyes I have seen my battle
These scenes ain't made for children
Lord help me, I've been feelin' grown

[Verse 1 : Mick Jenkins]
All I ever wanted was a young Patti Mayonnaise
Thinking we can make some cold cuts
Like planters we go nuts and plant seeds
And grow us and take naps, no, you can't comb us
Never met Wilder, young T.J. Detweiler
I mean what I'm trying to say is I'm an advocate for recess
To prevent a rapid regress, trying make it last forever
Young Keith Sweat going beast mode
Niggas feel so close still far away and I'm only one yard away
So I can't be in it for the pennies
Other niggas learn the harder way
I see nothing godly 'bout Charlamagne
It's either hot tea or it's water out the flutes like a Chardonnay
So pardon me for coming at a jagged edge
With a grill like Cardi B, but I will hardly be
Just a Gerald to some football head, nigga, hardly me
No Tom and Jerry cons, fuck a hit, I'm not Barry Bonds
That's on my soul til' they bury me

[Chorus]
When I was young
Thought I'd grow up, be a cartoon (cartoon)
Used to be Rugrat
Now I'm black Tommy Pickles
Trapped up in the costume (costume)
Trying to get out of that pardon my reach
But I need to change the channel
Now I have seen my battle
These scenes ain't made for children
Lord help me, I've been feelin' grown

[Verse 2: Noname]
And you can really think
That the money don't matter when the drugs come in
All my raps are for sale and my cigarette bleeding
Like the hallelujah catalogs of lungs I'm in
I've been drifting for a minute
With my body in the water of slaughter
Like they really might give it to the Donald
Playing the Trump card
I know White America dreams in all black
Dark conundrum for genocide happy as Kodak
Smile for the picture like you safe and they love you
Smile for the picture like they love you, lonely
Nina Simone, envision her like Zoey
History would die in the empty of a shadow
A battle in the war zone on the forefront of the news
Blues, blackberry tragic and tragic
I know I'm getting money when the drugs come in
And I know my mama safe for a minute, a minute

[Chorus]
When I was young
Thought I'd grow up, be a cartoon (cartoon)
Used to be Rugrat
Now I'm black Tommy Pickles
Trapped up in the costume (costume)

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
The money never make no man like me, man  like me
Lately the money is all I see
The money never make no man like me, man  like me
Lately the money is all I see
