[Hook]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady baby
If you were my man
If you were my man
If you were my man
I'd give my all to you

[Verse 1]
I'd give my all to you if you were my man
Like I'm a child of Destiny, I don't think you understand
I'd cater to you, learn to cook, be a waiter for you
Get too cocky then it's later for you
It's late at night, we laid in bed, you looking nice
Close the blinds, and the window, and bring out the ice
Whip cream, strawberry, fantastic
Edible arrange arrangement in my basket
Is this what love feel like? I like the way it feel
I like the talks on the telephone, the way that we chill
I like how every time he laugh it makes me laugh
I like the little smirk he get when he be, ;ookin at my ass like
She don't need no ass just to hold me down
Like she got a brain, bet I wife her down
Bet I take her to IKEA and start cashin' out
Nigga smoke a black and mild, who yo daddy now?

[Hook]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady baby
If you were my man
If you were my man
If you were my man
I'd give my all to you

[Verse 2]
We two peas in a pod
We too blessed to have each other we be thankin the gods
Show em' much love for much love they put in my life
Alleviate the stress of clubbin', try'na find Mr. Right
All my friends say good men ain't common
But he great, he's the epilogue for romance
Sometimes you should wait, 'cause
When the end come, it look like spasm
It sound like curled toes and slow orgasms
Oooh wait a minute, we should wait a minute
I ain't married, you ain't married, maybe this is sinnin'
Or maybe this is good livin' on a Tuesday
Puttin' in work getting thirsty

[Hook]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady baby
If you were my man
If you were my man
If you were my man
I'd give my all to you
