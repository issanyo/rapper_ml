[Intro]
He's good, but I’m better
You ain't gotta worry ‘bout me
‘Cause I know that I should be fed up
Fearing that he's over me
Baby I’m good, don't regret it
Standing on my own two feet
Single never tasted so sweet
But you ain't gotta worry ‘bout me, nah

[Chorus]
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he’s good, he’s good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He’s good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He’s good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better

[Verse]
Heard he got a new girl, no pressure
‘Cause baby she got nothing on me
Should've taken your time, reconsidered
‘Cause you weren't fully over me
Does she know it's a lie when you tell her
There's nowhere that you'd rather be?
‘Cause you be always calling me
When you know I don't wanna speak
You're tryna make me jealous (Jealous)
With pictures of your next ex (Next ex)
I know you just pretending
Really I couldn't care less
And now you're tryna see me
You think it's so damn easy, uh (Easy)
‘Cause boy I'm done, ain't going back there again, no

[Chorus]
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better

[Bridge]
And you know those days are over
Ain't nothing left for us to say anymore, no, no
And you, you know I am better
I'm doing better then before, before

[Chorus]
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
He's good (He's good)
He's good (He's good)
He's good, he's good, he's good
But baby I'm better, better, better, better, better
