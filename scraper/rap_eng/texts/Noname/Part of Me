[Chorus: Phoelix]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave

[Verse 1: Noname]
Riddle me this, Mona Lisa pizza pepperoni
Smilin' over phony speakers, gettin' a fit
Often of the shits, it's a party at my granny house
Now birthdays and funerals will only bring the family out
Riddle me new, politician do a dance for me
Hot potato, milly rock, devastation of kiddy bop
Idiot, itty bitty resentfulness
Riddle me gone, Chicago go go bye
Chicago Eastroom savage
Ashes for backstage passes, ashes to house on Ashland
Chicago go go cozy, move to LA county
Riddle my old life dead, riddle my new life dead
Riddle me, Lord, forgive me

[Chorus: Phoelix]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave

[Verse 2: Benjamin Earl Turner]
Shaking the dust off my heel as I get infected
Weekend trips to my aunties was an antiseptic
The fat boy anorexic ain't admit 'cause my complexion
Wrist like an Etch-a-Sketch, I'm sculptin' the pain in 'em like Edmonia Lewis
My notebooks less Jesus, more gospel to it
Let's holler and hoop and my niggas is stupid, my niggas is shootin'
Your interpretation of that last bar will tell me where you was rooted
Me and mines amongst the poplar still
I'm talkin' moonshine, night walkin', underground, high stakin'
Cop'll put the choppa on ya, make the pupils dilate
Oh what a drug is fear, oh what a love is close
Oh at the crib with the Coupe DeVille with the overdose
That made jealousy dance on the crowd
I been everywhere, everywhere let me down
Worn every hat, every hat with a crown
Now every head bowed, dear God

[Chorus: Phoelix]
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to be
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go, wipe your shoes 'fore you leave
