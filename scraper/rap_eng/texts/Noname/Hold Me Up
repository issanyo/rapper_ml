[Intro: Noname Gypsy + Kiara Lanier]
Mama hold me up, when I fall
Mama give me a place to call
When I get cold
And I get hungry
And I get weary
Nobody loves me
Mama hold me up, when I fall
Mama give me a place to call
When I get cold
And I get hungry
And I get weary
Nobody loves me
Mama hold me up
Daddy pays the bills, but mama holds me up
Daddy pays the bills, when that ain’t good enough
She holds me up and tells me she’s a soldier with two hearts
She got that love for me and she got that love for papa

[Verse 1: Noname Gypsy]
My mama holds me up, she loves me like I’m good enough
To put me down or pick me up
Don’t make me feel holy like an ice cream Saturday
Sad to say it’s true
Sad to see you blue, so I blew up the balloons
And I send it to the sky, super high, let it fly a bit
You got a vegan cupcake, let me try that shit
Mmm, scrum-diddly-umptious
Bump this at my little cousin’s first luncheon
He 'bout to graduate, life’s too good
And I wish you would step on my new K-Swiss
Somebody cop me that DRose jersey dress
I’m trying to swag, swag on these hoes
But actually he’s not a ho, he’s just a king
And that pinky ring bling da bling da blaow bling
Icy, I see you wanna talk shit
Now you wanna shake my hand cause I know Chano
That’s a damn shame, is that Noname
Nigga, you a damn lame
You could've changed the world while you studying me
Man I could've changed the world if it wasn’t for these

[Hook: Noname Gypsy + Kiara Lanier]
I’ve been trying to find my way
I’ve been trying to find my way
My way home

[Verse 2: Noname Gypsy]
My confessional, handwriting be regrettable, illegible
Somebody help me right my wrongs
We all pretty, so beautiful
Manicure, manifest all the right cuticles
Now my nail game Cee-Lo Green pretty and shit
Pretty in pink, pretty ready for David Chevy
Butterfly doors like stuntin' is a way of life
On my soul, when I get my check, I’mma get a chain
All gold inscription with no name
And a gypsy tattoo
And then a rubber ducky tattoo
Cause what’s cuter than a little rubber ducky
Swimming on my backbone in a sea of chocolate
Damn near nothing
But like, damn near nothing
But like damn near nothing

[Hook: Noname Gypsy + Kiara Lanier]
My happiness will hold me up on the darkest day, I say
Hello to sunshine
Hello to good times
Goodbye, goodbye
Yesterday, tomorrow look so new
Tomorrow look so new
Tomorrow look like me
Tomorrow look like you

[Verse 3: Noname Gypsy]
Two steps forward and two steps back
That’s too much poetry, like you can’t rap?
You can’t act hard, you can’t Trap God
You came from the other side of the black card
So how you gonna try to be a rap star?
Well, I do like to rhyme
Give a penny for your thoughts cause I’m not chasing dimes
And I’m not an activist, so my rap’s picket signs
A little, a little when they get time to
In between the lines where I’m trying not to find you
Two steps forward and two steps back
Then that nigga go again, popping up in a rap

[Hook: Noname Gypsy + Kiara Lanier]
I’ve been trying to find my way
I’ve been trying to find my way
My way home
My happiness will hold me up on the darkest day, I say
Hello to sunshine
Hello to good times
Goodbye, goodbye
Yesterday, tomorrow look so new
Tomorrow look so new
Tomorrow look like me
Tomorrow look like you

[Outro: Noname Gypsy]
My mama hold me up
She said I’m good enough
My mama hold me up
