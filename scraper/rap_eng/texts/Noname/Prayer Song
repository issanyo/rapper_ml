[Verse 1: Noname]
If you wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me later
Gentrify all my people, there's emptiness on the table
If you wanna help me to put me inside the cuffs
Put the cigarette in my back
Keep the hospitals overrun-run-run-run, Chicken Little
How my city gonna run off shits and giggles?
Politicians overzealous with the provolone
Ishkabibble's and incidentals
Dont crash the rental, its God and temple, and bible
Don't nobody got no holy, everybody got an iPhone
If you wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me
Good-good-good tonight, Inglewood tonight
LA be bright but still a dark city
So come get your happy and your new titties
Said go find your doctor, you can get Kimmy
Said oh how we used to love you

[Chorus: Adam Ness]
America the great, this grateful dead and life for me
Apple pie on Sunday morning, obesity and heart disease
Can you hear the freedom bells?
Can you see the rusty nails chip chip away on all the coffin?
Approach with caution, hallelujah, amen, amen
I was lost but thinking I was truly free (amen, amen)
Darkness lingers in the wake of slavery (amen, amen)
Hold me close, don't let me fall into the deep (amen, amen)
The lost have risen, a new religion, hallelujah, amen, amen

[Verse 2: Noname]
Put your hands behind your back, ante up all your crack bitch
I seen a cell phone on the dash, could've sworn it's a gun
I ain't see a toddler in the back after firing seven shots
A demon 'bout to get me, he watching me kill his mom
The hood is overflooded, these niggas is on the rise
Bake a cake with flour, it's better to gentrify
Why, oh why my dick getting bigger, this violence turn me on, me on
My mama finally seen her baby on Channel 2
She love me better when I be keeping the streets clean
Why, oh why my house getting bigger, corruption turn me on
Ain't no police locking up these niggas better than me
And my wife think I look like a man, I feel manly
I tell Stanley, when you grow up you gon' be like your dad
A free man in the land of the noose
They ain't tell me how to cry, just shoot
I did, they only taught me how to check her pulse, she dead
When I win it's like confessional, trying to find me a therapist
They taught me how to say amen, amen

[Chorus: Adam Ness]
America the great, it's Grateful Dead and life for me
Apple pie on Sunday morning, obesity and heart disease
Can you hear the freedom bells?
Can you see the rusty nails chipping away out on the coffin?
Approach with caution, hallelujah, amen, amen
I was lost but thinking I was truly free (amen, amen)
Darkness lingers in the wake of slavery (amen, amen)
Hold me close, don't let me fall into the deep (amen, amen)
The lost have risen, a new religion, hallelujah, amen, amen
