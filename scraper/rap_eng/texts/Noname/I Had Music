[Verse 1: Mont Jake]
You taught me how to roll up
Roll it up
While Nas would beautify my four walls
Exhaling white clouds through my mouth
And just dreaming 'bout a future so far away from these:

[Hook: Mont Jake]
Classroom tyrants would hit me again
When the questions bout' my weekend began
Staying out of neon lights
Put you right into an open spotlight

[Verse 2: Mont Jake]
I could never shake off
Shake them off
When I spent the days alone being off beat
Fifteen, too green,  anxiously
And excluded from the clique cuz we're too eccentric

[Hook 2: Mont Jake]
Classroom tyrants would hit me again
When the questions bout' my weekend began
Acting like a mystery
To everyone around me

[Bridge: Mont Jake] x 2
I would never let it show
I had nowhere else to go
But I was never all alone
I had music, I had music

[Verse 3: Noname]
Me and you and everyone would tag along
Me and you, a shadow [?] a memory of everybody's favourite song
I'm living my life like it's golden
[?]
Nice to meet you on nights like this we fall in love
[?]
[?]
[?] a simile for overdose
This is what love is
The music and the openness

[Hook: Mont Jake]
Classroom tyrants would hit me again
When the questions bout' my weekend began
Staying out of neon light
Put you right into an open spotlight
Monday morning was nothing but pain
Isolation I could never explain
Acting like a mystery
To everyone around me
