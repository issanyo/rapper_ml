[Ramaj Eroc]
Ohhh ohhhh ahhh ahhh

[Hook - Ramaj Eroc & Hannah Renee]
I know you lovin' me (yeah)
She know I'm lovin' her
I say I love you more (Say that I love you awww, yeah)
She says not like she do (Not like I do, nooo)
She do

[Verse 1]
I never knew this type of love could exist
This is more than sex appeal & wide hips
You're the apple of my eye, fuel to my flame
I swear I pray today because tomorrow it may change
Just look at chu, you're so unique & far from typical
The moment I laid eyes on you, I knew approaching you was pivotal
See, I'm not the type to speak first, I'm pretty shy
But i couldn't let the moment of my life to pass me by
Whoa, my soulmate
I feel I'm finally in paradise, shout out to Coldplay
Uh, yeah that's her favorite band, see i know where we stand
Baby If this here's a game, then I'm your biggest fan
If life is like a plane, then I just hope we land
I can be your Ronnie and you can be my Sam
But we gone make it work, our emotions on that 9-to-5
If I let you know whats up, will you be down to ride?
And No one's stopping you, when I found who I wanted to spend the rest my life with
I wanted the rest of my life to start as soon as possible...well...uh
We can not fail
And by your face expressions & a body language, I can tell...

[Hook - Ramaj Eroc & Folayan]
I know you lovin' me (I know you loving me)
She know I'm lovin' her (He know I'm lovin' him, lovin' him)
I say I love you more (He love me, he love me more)
She says not like she do (I say not like I do...I do)

[Verse 2 - NoName Gypsy]
I know my soul committed all, religious in a vivid afterlife
Was half the price of yesterday, a penny for your sorrow
Canary yellow diamond daffodils, I took the sun
And made a pillow for tomorrow, illuminated dream
Just before the breaking of a dawn
Fabricated blankets of us praying on the lawn
I bought a pack of cigarettes, the internet was mighty kind
Intercept pettiness with a naked state of mind
Love is love, love forever whether or not
We see the sun, underneath a hard rock & hard place
Cynical mind state, but my heart in it
Neither love in it always giving you a pretty smile
After while, we just sit and meditate
We can celebrate the new life we discovered
The only lover, who can love me back to paradise
My sweetie pie

[Hook - Ramaj Eroc & Folayan]
(together) I know you lovin' me
She know I'm lovin' her

She says not like she do
