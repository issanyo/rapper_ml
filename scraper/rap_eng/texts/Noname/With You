[Verse]
This is my happy ever suicide
My hands tied behind my breast
My silhouette did pirouettes
The curtains are closing
My baby was my ooh-lah lah, neverlasting
My baby was my cry me rivers and shadow casting
Who could be my lovely, my lovely?
Who could be my only one, my only?
I'm almost just as empty as you think I am, a penny for your thoughts
A witty pear of happiness, a pretty Ricky Ross
A maid black music, I woke up in my sympathy, became black Judas
All my everythings for sale
All my secondhand discoveries, Dungarees faded pale
All my halfway hallelujahs that tippy-toed in the mail
All the fluctuations on scales
And the missing therapy sessions of bullets treating me well
Well, we don't drink that
If it ain't the top shelf, nigga you can keep that
Shared my life on Telefone, room 25 and 306, and 809 became my home
Gave you a taste of my redemption and now I want my drink back
Somebody hold me like I'm almost enough
Somebody told me pray for heaven, saw how tiny it was
Little love from me, we can build this home alone
Alone
Forever with you, forever with you
I'm a home away from home hold me and promise you'll keep this secret
And promise you won't forget me, the telly that smells like peaches
He who leeches on lovers lane, change their laughter for London
Wireless festival reparable, so good when he wasn't
