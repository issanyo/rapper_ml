[Hook]
Every time I feel alive I think about dead friends
The rest is just dead to me
Sleeping couch to couch just to find a way in
Living on my own now
Living on my own now
Living on my own now

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
And the truth is over-ridiculed
Verdict never human, but something more spiritual
But put it through the physical
It's enemies and animals and generalist Hannibals
And gotta be acceptables, I never took the corners
I was way more diagonal, corner power
With the power that he held in the streets so intangible
Look up to the kin, know the color of the skin
More like a correlation with the nature that's within
Told everybody I was related to him
Big homie that is, blaze one up to this
I was in a battlefield with the neutralist grounds
He was born on the wrong side of the gun sound
Intentions, never knew, never seen him pull a trigger
But I knew when he came around he never show that figure
But the gang signs around him
Always gonna make him think of better ways of living life
Let me show this little nigga
Change directions, reach a popular view
Don't be a knucklehead on Crooks Avenue
Don't be like me, nigga, fight for your dreams
I know you do music that will bring your needs
Left my comfort zone for two years now
Working on career now
Then you heard news of the same child
Cause I'm around you, lost hope
But I made it possible, take your advice
Bro, I heard you paint well
Dope, don't do the block, nigga, keep doing you
My outlet growing bigger, I support too
You did me a favor and I made the move
Now I'm a star, least I could do is just pay all my dues
News just in, another fallen angel
The world is so cruel, my heart turn in two

[Hook]
Every time I feel alive I think about dead friends
The rest is just dead to me
Sleeping couch to couch just to find a way in
Living on my own now, living on my own now
Living on my own now
Every time I feel alive I think about dead friends
The rest is just dead to me
Sleeping couch to couch just to find a way in
Living on my own now, living on my own now
Living on my own now

[Verse 2: Noname]
I was partially standin' beside him when they parted the Red Sea
See the blood on the hydrant and the leaves like 'Ye said
They dead, funeral, newspaper like a brand new obituary
Rapping my contemporaries, I ain't gotta think about it
I dreamt about it; what's a demon to a ghetto now?
Move around, heard a couple shots in my solitude, hallelu
Went right past, that's what God'll do
They found nutritional value at the base of my conscious
It taste like peaches, no nonsense
No Noname, no tickets for purchase
My market was marketing Gypsy for prophet or profit
Cause everybody speaks truth, believe in your words
Believe in yourself, the things we dream about
And let them feed you

[Outro: Noname]
Living on my own now
Living on my own now
Living on my own now
Living on my own now
