[Chorus]
Make my wrong turn right, make my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me, make me look like reverend
Make me look like regal, Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal, I swear I look so regal
Make my wrong turn right, make my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me, make me look like reverend
Make me look like regal, Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal, I swear I look so regal

[Verse]
Oh my baby got to know me, I'm looking like I'm the homie
I'm tatted from head to shoulder, I'm colder when he don't hold me
I'm warmer inside the casket, basket atop my head
Africa's never dead, Africa's always dying
No more apples or oranges, only pickles and pacifists
Twitter ranting for martyrdom unified as capitalists
Give 'em death be gone, give 'em Teflon Don
Give 'em Rice-A-Roni politics to bear more arms
And watch the bears come out
Yeah

[Chorus]
Make my wrong turn right, make my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me, make me look like reverend
Make me look like regal, Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal, I swear I look so regal
Make my wrong turn right, make my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me, make me look like reverend
Make me look like regal, Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal, I swear I look so regal
