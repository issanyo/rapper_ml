[Verse 1]:
No sadness, we was past that, me money get the last laugh
Me ASCAP, get cash back, see Venmo, see cash app
We came by San Francisco knowing that you couldn't match that
But everything is everything, I'll merch that, I'll tat that
So new to throwing ass back, but watch this nigga moan
Got some pussy in the resume, like look who put you on
Mrs. Petty, Mrs. Pettigrew, lived for one day, all in all I loved you
Airport malls and empty walks and tele with the late view
Almost tried to hate you but I love to love to love to love you bae
Mr. Lonely, Mr. Distant Man, Mr. Bad Decision make this home again
Mr. Loney, Mr. Distant Man, mister mister mister

[Verse 2]:
All my walls are painted apathy and let it be
And remember you were good for him and bad for him
And savage him was sweet to me
Flowers always remedy when they be out the blue
All me walls are painted purple
All my walls are painted baby gray
You know this nigga hurt you
All everything for nothing
All cigarettes and breakfast and fucking before the paint dries
Maybe I was knee deep, I can't lie
Maybe I was chasing the safe high
Always fucking you in the daytime
