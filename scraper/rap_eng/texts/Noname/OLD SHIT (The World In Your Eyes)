Sounds like a dimming lantern when a man turns alcoholic
Post apocalyptic narcotic, I swear it feels like sin
I swear I only drink the violin I meant the gin
I meant to ask Tiny Tim
To crawl up my limbs, then under skin
Understand, makin' holidays with the fam
Christmas don't feel like my wishlist no more
There's no snow on the floor, but there's snow on the counter
New Year party, better ask somebody to dance
Raise your hands, grab the ceiling fan
Know you're a helicopter, hella proper
No one stop her
Let her fly, let her fly, let her fly, let me trip
Nothing feels better than the falling, bathroom stalling before the vomit arrives
Watch the commit orbiting in my eyes
I'm still wishing him here, fuck this stupid rap career
Fuck this stupid rap career, I'm still wishing him here
I'm still oozing dead shadows stitched in tears
Blanket me in forgetting
Don't let me get live past 31
I bleed sugar for practice, you just bleed for fun
I'm just bleeding funds, warm and cozy
Need no clothing
It's time to ascend
Great Granny where you been?
Uncle Henry where you been?
Uncle Maine where you been?
Ben where been? Where you been?
Seven deadly dwarfs called sin
The fairies don't tell themselves, a re-blessing
And pressing upon the good word
What it were, what it may
What is read, what it say
All that is holy is not
The only thing holy is your heart when it
The only thing holy is your soul when it stops
The only thing holy is my heart when it drops
