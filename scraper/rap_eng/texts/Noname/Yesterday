[Refrain: Noname]
And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul
And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul

[Verse 1: Noname]
Who am I? Gypsy rap, Gypsy need her dollar back
And all of that, my devil is only closer when I call him back
Liquor in a limelight, look her in the limelight
With fine wine and ecstasy, you can have the rest of me
Basket case silhouette, cigarette, internet
Check my twitter page for something holier than black death
Who am I? Gypsy black, the vacancy of hallelu
Me hollow in my interviews
Me only wearing tennis shoes to clubs with dress codes
Cause fuck they clubs
Everything is everything, me Noname, you niggas doing cocaine
Me missing brother Mike, like something heavy
Me heart just wasn't ready; I wish I was a kid again

[Hook: Akenya, TheMIND, Noname]
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday

[Verse 2: Noname]
When I remember memories don't last forever
When I deny my empty with an open letter
Who gon remember me? My satellite, my empathy
The wheels be chrome, chrome spiffy, the Lord with me
My halo said goodbye and the floor hit me
Fill the lining in the pine box, my granny fill the time slot
"Don't grow up too soon
Don't blow the candles out, don't let them cops get you"
My granny almost Sparrow I can see the wings
The choir sings, and la da di la di da da da, dah
Only he can save my soul

[Refrain: Noname]
And I know the money don't really make me whole
The magazine covers drenched in gold
The dreams of granny in mansion and happy
The little things I need to save my soul

[Hook : Akenya, TheMIND, Noname]
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday
When the sun is going down
When the dark is out to stay
I picture your smile, like it was yesterday

[Outro: Noname, Akenya, TheMIND]
When the sun is
When the sun is
When the sun is
When the sun is going down
