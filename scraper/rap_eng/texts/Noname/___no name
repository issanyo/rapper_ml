[Verse: Noname]
No name for people to call small or colonize optimism
No name for inmate registries that they put me in prison
I sewed the answers in linen, phantom under the thread
Tandom riding in your cities where niggas scared of the feds
There's a ghost on my bike, said he laid with a bullet
Re wrote the scriptures for living in all the ways that he couldn't
Gave up the profit for pennies, no taste in mystery pudding
When labels ask me to sign, say my name don't exist, so many names don't exist
Moved into Inglewood and the trauma came with the rent
Only worldly possession I have is life, only room that I died in was 25
What's an eye for an eye when niggas won't love you back?
And medicine's overtaxed, no name look like you
No name for private corporations to send emails to
'Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody's name gon' exist
Just boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiance

[Bridge: Yaw]
Through all the joy and all the pain
Don't forget from where you came
The avenue remembers you
Your song, your truth, your light is proof
That love is still with you

[Outro: Adam Ness]
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
Your life, you life, is your life, baby
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
