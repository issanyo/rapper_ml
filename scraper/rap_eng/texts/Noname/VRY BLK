[Verse 1: Jamila Woods]
Black is like the magic, and magic's like a spell
My brothers went to heaven, the police going to
... yeah, they're going to, hello operator, emergency hotline
If I say that I can't breathe, will I become a chalk line
Line up to see the movie, line up to see the act
The officers are scheming to cover up their
Cover up their...ask me no more questions, tell me no more lies
Your serving and protecting is stealing babies lives

[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
I'm very black, black, black
Can't send me back, back, back
You take my brother, brother, brother
I fight back, back, back, back
I'm very black, black, black
I made a pact, pact, pact
You take my brother, brother, brother
I fight back, back, back, back

[Verse 2: Noname]
Everything is everything, a mantra says the guillotine
A missionary commissioned misery into angel wings
And all he wanna do is be still and cut bread
Never know the dead, how they whisper "Forgive me"
Everything is relative, politicize the evidence
I heard a politician reiterate all the messages
And all he wanna do is feed family, be famous
Never know the poor, how they scream out "Redeem me"
Everything is casualty, a song I heard, the bullets sing
I know a couple babies gon' see 'em fly tonight
He wish he wasn't magic, all he wanna do is be a passage
In a book titled "America the Savage"
Symphony is symphony, when everything was meant to be
Piano man and drummer boy just invented a song for me
And all I wanna do is find love and be happy
And all I wanna do is find love

[Chorus: Jamila Woods]
I'm very black, black, black
Can't send me back, back, back
You take my brother, brother, brother
I fight back, back, back, back
I'm very black, black, black
I made a pact, pact, pact
You take my brother, brother, brother
I fight back, back, back, back
I'm very black, black, black
(Double, double this)
Can't send me back, back, back
(Double, double that)
You take my brother, brother, brother
(The trouble trouble is)
I fight back, back, back, back
(I'm very, very black)

[Outro: Jamila Woods]
And that is all I, that is all I know
And that is all I, that is all I know
That is all I... is all I know
And that is all I, that is all I know
