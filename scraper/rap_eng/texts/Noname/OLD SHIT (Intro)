Telefone tell em' bout my vertebra
As crooked like my smile was
But braces got me hella straight
As if I were the quickest distance between
Two points. Align me holy in the cherry field
Am I a hero for saving myself?

Telefone tell em' I ain't saved yet
Telefone tell em' I sat and drank Whiskey
With the sun until the day left. Just
Like papa, just like MF DOOM

If I'm majestic like a star
Or a gypsy
Telefone, why you don't ring no more?
Who hit me up the other day? Was it a label?
No No...just the alarm
