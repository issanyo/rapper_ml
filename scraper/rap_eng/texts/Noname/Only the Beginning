[Verse 1: theMIND]
Yeah
Embers
Falling from the incense that's burning
Timbers
Caught up in a deep thought yearning
For answers
I'll never get, I can't forget
I often sweat, when haunted nightly, by regret like
Why I ain't kill that nigga when my sister told me what he did to her?
Like, I often fear for her
Not, for her safety, she damn near like
Really crazy
More like her living out her full potential
All of her constraints are often mental
Over indulging, insecurities, poor planning, lack of vision
It's really simple if you break it down
Shit I'm no better, but I know together we're made of magic
Nothing's impossible and anything we need, we have it
The world is yours in the space above
And I know you'll do nothing more than fill this space with love
Take the opportunities that come to you
And if they don't come, run to them

[Bridge: theMIND]
Ooooooooo
Ooooooooo
Ooooooooo
Ooooooooo

[Pre-Hook: theMIND]
Don't look no further than over your shoulder, I'm here
You been wasting all your time
Afraid of all your fears
Don't look no further than over your shoulder, I'm here
You been wasting all your time
Afraid of all your fears

[Hook: theMIND]
I been waiting on the moment
I finally realized that I'm here
I finally realized that I'm here
I been waiting on the moment
I finally realized that I'm here
I finally realized that I'm here (I'm here)
I been waiting on the moment
I finally realized that I'm here (I'm here)

[Verse 2: Noname]
I'm here, it's clear I love you
I put no one above you
I left my baggage back on beverly when I travel
When I paddle, testimony, tell the gavel
We don't need no judges, I don't need no lawyers
I got lemonade, far away from here
From me and me and amore
The morning after
The after the masters and money
The coffee and actors
Who did we become, who did we become?
Transcend the moment run away from fear

[Break]
Wake up!

[Verse 3: theMIND]
Vows in front of pastors
We're slaves avoiding capture
I love you past the rapture
This is only our beginning
Atoms made up Eve
Ego made man fall
Our world is rather young
In the grand scheme of it all
I was born in pieces
Love done made me whole
Devil stole my childhood
Now God won't make me old
This is only
The beginning for you and I (I said)
This is only
The beginning for you and I (Yeah)
