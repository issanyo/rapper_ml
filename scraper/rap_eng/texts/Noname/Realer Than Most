[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I keep it realer than most, this phrase is often used too loosely
Amongst these niggas puttin' pencils to this loose leaf
Makin' stencils of each others shit
They take a virus from that mother board, straight back to their mothership
I've been on some other shit, grew up fightin' on some lover shit
That moms ain't seen my uncle's brother single mother shit
Don't tell me you familiar with the struggle if you clueless
Rhonda got a second job after diagnosed with lupus
We survivors nigga, give a fuck about your rider niggas
Cause it's always dead minds that's the livest niggas
Cause it's always dead minds that's the livest niggas

[Verse 2: Dally Auston]
All I ever need was a little bit
Tell me that it's more than I got to get
Well obviously you know I break it down like a prophecy
Roll more weed to get more high, birds I seen they just don't fly
Lives I seen they just don't shine
Keep it realer than those
Save the lives, that's a hundred to boast
And when we die thats a hundred or more
And where I'm from they don't love you enough
Thats why my mind tell me get it and go
Nigga run, get up out of the 'Go
They don't love me but it's low where I go
And if I want it nigga take what I want
Nigga face it, hit a light of the blunt
And when I die, roll enough to one up

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]
Hey tell 'em
Start up the whip, spark up the joint
Start with the movement, homie, start with the point
We keep it realer than most
We keep it realer than most
Hey tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
Start up the whip, spark up the joint
Start up a movement, homie, start with the point
We keep it realer than most
We keep it realer than most

[Verse 3: NoName Gypsy]
Luminescent campaign, dark red bubble coke
Make her toast and a coke, Effervescent champagne
Chandelier pipe dreams, niggas that's real shit
Osteoporosis approaching my granny's heels quick
Who gonna change your life and the life of your future babies?
The reason these niggas love me, the reason these I'm goin' crazy
Mixtape ain't comin' out until Moses learn how to save me, forreal
I ain't gotta lie, I ain't gotta lie

[Hook: Mick Jenkins]

[Verse 4: Saba]
Enough, yeah that's enough
They say I'm about to have a breakout year like my skin actin' up
Yeah I be readin' what they talkin' about, and that's whats up
But I can give a fuck about niggas and they opinion
Poetry in motion how my haikus movin'
Fan base universal not just high school students
Fuck your targeted audience
Everybody nod to this shit and I'm callin it quits
If they tell me that my message lacks enough direction
I'm the voice of this city, thats the fuckin' vessel
And y'all ain't bleedin' enough to be competin' with us
So who better than me to literally be the leader
I'm Peter Petrelli, a hero
Good in the hood like Pelle Pelle, I'm ready to rock
Like Redman drop shit like confetti
Drop bodies they deadly go with the flow like a lefty
Levi rockin' rockin' steady
Hush little baby don't you cry
