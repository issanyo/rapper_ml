[Verse 1: Noname Gypsy]

I'm bad at reading
I'm not the brightest
I've got bronchitis and asthma
A pump in the purse if you ask her
Talking in third like a personal master
Of I, me an unwritten happy goodbye
The secret is staying away from the liquor
I love it, I'm sicker than you
I'm the apathy that you left at the crib
I will happily give you sunshine and kids
Every song is a sweet little baby
I am the lady that lives in the shoe
A Gypsy, an allergic reaction to all of your petty
A simple ah-choo

[Verse Two: Jean Deaux]

Throw some confetti
For paintings and galleries
Making a salary, drinking their daiquiris
You a light-weight, count in' your calories
I can tell why you mad at me
I smoke too much, stretch marks cause I grow too much
Hay fever, I'm hard to touch
You a lame, I go hand in crutch
I'm a bookworm in a garden maze
Just a ghost inside the face
Inside your mind like the weed was laced
Death to fakes and I dig the grave
But it's just for taste, I might disappear
You can save the chase
If a nigga move fast, better fix the pace
Before he get replaced
Head in the clouds, still stuck in space
Dead in the crowd, living through the bass
Working on my anger
Found love with a stranger inside a time chamber
He only smoke papers, doin drugs until noon
Took a walk on the moon, and dissolved into light vapors

[Chorus: Jean Deaux]

I know you hear me talking to you
I know you hear me talking to you
I know you hear me talking to you
And you can feel it too
Feel it too
I see right through you, yeah

[Chorus]
