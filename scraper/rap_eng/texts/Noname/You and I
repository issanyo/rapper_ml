[Verse 1]

I lost you to Guatemalan summertime
Damn, we was just beginning
Our city feel like water over inexperienced swimmers
How we sink into the emails, so easy so swift
I didn't know you could write like that
I keep thinking about the nights we had
The lights go black
You handsome, like
Buttermilk pancakes, but less tan
On tandem we'll ride out
Had a dream about that
How you know your girl was keen on jazz?
I leaned on Jack
Daniels dismantled my solitude
Bryce went and build me a new house

[Verse 2]

We be naked on the rooftop, chillin' and shit
Tumultuous relationship, French vanilla incense
I didn't know I could burn so good
Oven hot baker boy, golden crust
Stovetop cherrywood
Sweet fascination, little adaptation
To a story never written
Ascend with my palms in my hand a letter
Understand me better
Always chainsmoke butterflies for rainbow textures
May your words be colorful
Girl on the southside Chicago, let you go

[Hook]

All I am is summertime, birds and bees
All I am, is you and I
All I am is summertime, birds and bees
All I am, is you and I
