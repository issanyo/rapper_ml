[Verse 1]
Sweet Mary Jane, Mary-Kate and Ashley
Two twins rolled up, I think it was a Saturday
After they learned to wear pearls all pretty
Backwoods, back porch, trees so fitting
Grass so green, so sticky with the dew
Some optical illusion, imaginary blue
A secondary lullaby that's sittin' in the pew
Breakin' down another hue
My first love, so how you goin' leave and let the roaches in?
I ain't got a bunch of money, walls is closing in
Remember, the winter, December? You made me crazy
Everytime I smoked, it looked like everyone was bald
I could see my insecurities depicted in the fog
Run run rabbit, don't follow the clock
Tic-tac totally, undermining your thoughts
I need more exes, I need more hoes
I need less contentment, I need more clothes
Run run rampant, vapid, acid, candid
Smell too loud, my family couldn't stand it
A little weed is a little more love

[Hook 1]
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
I love you, I love you

[Hook 2]
Sour patch, lemon drop
Bubble Gum, cherry pop
Swisher cocoa blanket, you done gone
And got me faded again

[Hook 3]
Oo-wee oo-wee, doobie doobie
I break the law, I smoke my weed
I had to stop 'cause I hate to tweak
Bet next week I'mma do it again

[Verse 2]
14 hours
14 blunts like a morphine shower
You ain't ready for that
You ain't re-writing Leviticus and call it a rap
Alphabet, Alcatraz, I'mma letter the map
And national caps, I'm cheifin'
Where the governors at?
I know 14 ghosts and they chasin' the pack
That ain't shit to coy with, shit to toy with
These paper airplanes made a beautiful joystick, oo
Smokin' a cloud, throw in the towel
Boxed in, boxed out, Mr. Pacqui-di-ao
Pack of the loud, good as it gets
Couple of hits
One more cypher, then I'm callin' it quits

[Hook 1]
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
Sweet Mary, Mary Jane
I love you, I love you

[Hook 2]
Sour patch, lemon drop
Bubble Gum, cherry pop
Swisher cocoa blanket, you done gone
And got me faded again

[Hook 3]
Oo-wee oo-wee, doobie doobie
I break the law, I smoke my weed
I had to stop 'cause I hate to tweak
Bet next week I'mma do it again

[Outro]
A little weed is a little more love
Bet next week I'mma do it again
A little weed is a little more love
Bet next week I'mma do it again
