[Hook]
I know
I know
I know

[Verse 1]
Here we are, inside of the movies
The last time you touched me
The last time you knew me
It's a doozie how we jump back
Lungs fat with a coughin, how often
Everything you said to me was dead to me
Let it be a bygone how you python
Mama said never dance wit snakes wit the lights on

[Verse 2]
Watch me shimmy 'til the lights go dim-y
While I leave him the juice and I drink all the Henny
Anybody probable seen me at the open mic, pissy drunk
Here she come with her little raps in her bottle
Genie gypsy booze,, booze she would swallow
Kiss the apostle when she couldn't find her Jesus
She's just a little lost, a little sad, a little lost
A little lonely after her and lover boy didn't hit it off
Off with the offering, properly ask the auctioning block
Nonchalant, cherry on the top
Who's a slave in the slave house made out pretty
Lost my love, found my city

[Hook 2]
Everything I ever was
I lost in the cigarette smoke tonight
I know this feeling won't last forever but
God damn it still hurt
It still hurt like
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
Everything I ever was
I lost in the cigarette smoke tonight
I know this feeling won't last forever but
God damn it still hurt
It still hurt like
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
