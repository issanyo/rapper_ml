[Verse 1: PlvXid]
I be Rollin with a gypsy she got no name
I bought the 40s she brought the gas smell like propane
In that old school shit like Rogaine
And I'm a rookie let me show you how I do things
Get ready for the new face of hip hop, it's my time homie go ahead and check ya wrist watch
But be mindful of just staring cause time is passing, I might sneak up and attack.. to my advantage and start causing some damage
You niggas can't really stand it, the way this youngin' spitting
I roar on tracks while y'all purr soft like kittens, freestyle or written
It really don't matter I'm Mario spitting fire and y'all goombas you better scatter
I hear a beat fall in love with and the I kill it
Get out of ya seat hands to the sky I want y'all to feel it and fuck a hobby this shit is my life it's why I'm living and I'm always sparing bars but the topics just how I'm feeling
And at this moment I wish that I could hold it was always told by people that I wouldn't be nothing
And got them same people having they hand out asking for something but they never have time to invest in the art
Just tryna make my pockets the same size as my heart I think I reached my peak and I'm about to jump off but not fearing of where I will go cause I know the vibes will carry me until I finally find my flow I think I found my flow

[Chorus]
I think I finally found my flow (repeat)
I'm feeling your energy (repeat)

[Verse 2: Noname]
I'm feeling you like black magic on saturday
Micro manage depression and pray the emptiness fade away
Everything is everything irrelative while happily ever after is cautionary benevolence
Who are you to know me and steady hold me accountable I found the God in you, it look like rain
On my granny's front porch we at the basketball court just chillin, chillin, chillin
It's easier to lie inside a rap song its easier to keep the caps on so I'm screaming all my statements
I hope you see me now
I hope you think I'm good again
I really hope I'm good again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I think I finally found my flow, I think I finally found my flow, I think I finally, I think I finally found my flow
