[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training
Chain snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and the pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one temptation that had Otis' back
Sparring is training this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor
Card cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited
You still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
"Wake up, wake up" like remember me?
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies

[Verse 2: Noname]
Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, non religious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D
But bet I sting, no die

[Transition: Chance The Rapper & Noname]
Sparring is training

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Jacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him
And he blessed him and he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

[Transition: Noname (Chance The Rapper)]
You giving back? (I'm giving back)
Tit for tat

[Verse 4: Noname]
Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum

[Transition: Together]
Excuse them, they know of what they do

[Verse 5: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be onnat elegant hella melanin
Pelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens

[Outro: Chance The Rapper (Noname)]
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
Aha, and you don't stop
Boom bap, and you don't stop
I told you that was gonna be fun though
