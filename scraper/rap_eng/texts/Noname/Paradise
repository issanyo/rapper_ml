[Hook: Queen SheCago]
Tony the tiger told me not to lie
I’m brain dead, I’m too high
I drifted to the other side of
Blue and white of paradise, of paradise

[Verse 1: Noname]
Good morning little ones under little sons
Licking lemonade crunchy curls off of little thumbs
You wanna grow up now, you wanna be a big kid
Pushing metal carts down a blank grocery aisle
Oh, child, stay young for a minute
I’m paying bills like I was only young for a minute
Life is different, golden ticket
Cotton candy, don’t you miss it? I know I do
I know I wanna get my songs on iTunes then see the world
Then write new music that feeds the world
I’m not black enough to go back to Africa; fast enough
Decaffeinated on the grounds of a massacre
It’s like that for real
Nightcap, right back to my record deal
I wanna help people, I wanna be rich
I wanna be the Bob Marley of this rap music

[Verse 2: Noname]
My whole-hearted melody, lost in amphetamines
Trapped in a box, I was drinking more Kerosene
Believe the reason why breathing is so appeasing
I met the angel of death in the breath of a gothic Eden
You not hearing this, you not Dilated Peoples
And a hand-etched to god like a lyricist, hear me roar
Metaphor, hypocrite, dear me lord, steer me 'fore I fly again
Die within, lie with him
On a top notch bed of locusts
I’m ready to make good on a bed with the roses
Oh this is life, empty bank account and a kitchen knife
I quit the weed, I had to leave a friend in need
It’s been 30 days since she looked at me

[Bridge: Noname]
And I’m sorry
Good things come
Good things come to an end
Good things come to an end
Good things come to an end
Sometimes
Good things come
Good things come

[Hook: Queen SheCago]
Tony the tiger told me not to lie
I’m brain dead, I’m too high
I drifted to the other side of
Blue and white of paradise, of paradise
