[Verse 1: Noname Gypsy]
If Spike Lee had a girlfriend who could rap she would be me
Mo' Betta natural
But mo pretty weavy
Socio political individual black with a perm
3 dimensional naps had to burn
Slave life
Shimmer and sparkle in day light when the money come in quick
And you hair lookin real nice like
I might take you back, I'm feelin pretty
Eggs on the table and the stove lookin gritty
Itty bitty on the main line
Tryna get to Noname
Vagabond gypsy bitch, never did cocaine
Only smoked cigs, only did weed
Then quit
Shit
Wasn't supposed to say that
Rap relax wit loud packs fillin laid back
Oohh how I miss that
Marijuana Smoke

[Chorus 1: Noname Gypsy, Via Rosa, and Akenya]
So I'm having second thoughts
And I really wanna get back together
With you, if you will have me darling
I never should have let you go
Never should have let you go

[Verse 2: Noname Gypsy]
First things first I miss you
And your paper thin lips
The way I kiss you, the way you hit back
Smack
Why you gotta love me so hard
Bae, I'm already faded
All dressed up in your smoke
Favorite vacant parking spot
I sparked the bark
And lit the tree, the aftermath in after dark
Was all the love of sympathy
You feel me?
And when you see my name in the lights
On the night when the moon bright
Carve out a piece of my soul
It’s gold like blunts in the summertime
And taste like a bitter sweet memory
Member these metaphors sippin on Hennessey
I ain't never used to drink when I had you
Lullaby the paranoia with the cashews
If you gon get crazy
Go nutty
For real

[Chorus 2: Noname Gypsy, Via Rosa, and Akenya (2X)]
I might take you back
You belong wit me
It's been a long long time
Since I last smoked weed
I miss you if you didn't know
Telefone can we call up Mary Jane again?

[Verse 3: Noname Gypsy]
You ain't never see me get blunted
You ain't never seen me story tell
I L’Oréal, I beautify
Gettin' high like fuck tomorrow
Gettin' high, too high like bitch you tweakin'?
I saw you in the crawl space across from the hallways
Where crazy had two kids where sanity once stayed
They don't get it, they don't know you
They ain't seen a pale sky
The blank road, you got close to

[Bridge: Noname Gypsy, Via Rosa, and Akenya]
Ooo if I could roll another with my lover man I would
Damn I would smoke you out
Ooo if I could roll another with my lover man I would
Damn I would smoke you out

[Chorus 2: Noname Gypsy, Via Rosa, and Akenya (2X)]
