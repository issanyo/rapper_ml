[Verse 1: Noname]
Open apology for little black girl, don't you follow me
I'm never getting on, I look like empty yesterday or Anna Mae
My cake ain't getting money, dummy down a violent metaphor
Who be the magic in my magic hour
Baby, liquor gon' and lick the wound, baby masochist in afternoon
Catalog the vacancy and pray my fame is coming soon
Cause maybe I'm not talented enough for angel wings
I done done some things, I just hope the Lord forgive me
I'm a maple tree, got my niggas with me for a minute
Ode to Chicago, fuck a "Chiraq"
Ode to Chicago, and the Harold's chicken
Uncle Remus' duplex with the Cadillac
Utopian aristocats for cats getting money
But still smoke reggie, and love me sunny
Like carnations in a magazine, magazine pretty
Diamond cascade off the collarbone, watch it waterfall
Lemonade the happiness for niggas that ain't getting on
And pray, pray, pray, for the better of tomorrow

[Verse 2: Saba]
Humble beginnings, now they all look jaded
That shit doesn't exist, you almost famous
They'd give up everything to be acknowledged
Ain't left home in a week, I'm busy hiding
They keep telling me that I'm next in line but
I'm still at home and I live with my momma
If rap don't work, it's not too late for college
They think I got it better than I got it
What I got is...

[Outro: Noname & Saba]
Plenty thoughts of my star
Burning from the love I've found
We do it for the people, and my momma
And the city on my shoulder
And the babies on the come up
When your love is your job
Is it as hard as I've found?
I've found my city, I've found my love
I've found my city, I've found my love
Plenty thoughts of my star
Burning from the love I've found
We do it for the people, and my momma
And the city on my shoulder
And the babies on the come up
When your love is your job
Is it as hard as I've found?
I've found my city, I've found my love
I've found my city, I've found my love
