[Part I: Amphetamine]

[Chorus]
Moonlight disrupt the day
Been like this every night
Walking in stumbling
Fucked up some bread today
Though I said no no this time
Cycles on cycles
It's like an amphetamine
How it marinate on my mind
Stuck on me, yah
Got no doubt I'll be alright
If I just make it through the night

[Verse 1]
Pass me the amphetamine
Right now can't focus on anything
Why they take lil bro instead of me?
I hurt when you hurt, we was siamese
Nigga was seventeen, when I found out what that cheddar mean
Rats'll bite holes through the wall to get close
Watch for their trail, man they always be close
Back-a-wood rolla, really a smoker
This louder than when you drive on the shoulder
Stomp on the gas 'til I'm blowin' the motor
Can't 'ford to sit with my thoughts or it's over
Really but luckily, I got a real one, she fuck wit me
Shawty, she yellow, yeah keep me on my toes, stay mellow
She deserve a fucking ring

[Bridge]
I'm off the sedatives
Amphetamine
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed
Sedatives
Amphetamine
Sedatives
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed

[Chorus]
Moonlight disrupt the day
Been like this every night
Walking in stumbling
Fucked up some bread today
Though I said no no this time
Cycles on cycles
It's like an amphetamine
How it marinate on my mind
Stuck on me, yah
Got no doubt I'll be alright
If I just make it through the night
Moonlight disrupt the day
Been like this every night
Walking in stumbling
Fucked up some bread today
Though I said no no this time
Cycles on cycles
It's like an amphetamine
How it marinate on my mind
Stuck on me, yah
Got no doubt I'll be alright
If I just make it through the night

[Bridge]
I'm off the sedatives
Amphetamine
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed
Sedatives
Amphetamine
I don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm headed
No

[Part II: Krash Kourse]

[Intro]
God damn, [?]
Swn, swn, swn, swn, swn

[Verse: Smino]
Ay
Krash kourse into the world
This insular world
The culture vultures flock in every sense of the word
My nose can sniff the shit out but I'm never deterred
Never be scurred, scored through the downs, first and third
Grandaddy spittin, ain't nothing new bout the system
'Cause how they do me they did him
Appropriating the fellas
Sucking the fruit from my elders
Don't give a Chuck bout no Berry
They rather listen to Elvis
Woah, mama
And these kids know better, uh
I'm grand like abuela, uh
More hands than Coachella, uh
Lil hoe it's whatever, uh
Shawty cold as December, I still fold her, no Manila
B-b-b-brr wit me baby, I hibernate, smoke the lettuce
No niggas jammed off the reggie
Free all my dogs, fuck Kruella
Nigga need cream, vanilla, ele-vate
Coconut Beamer, oiled up, switching lanes
Chocolate interior, that's a belly ache

[Chorus: Bari]
I done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh
She on the payroll, he on the payroll
I want queso, I want the caseload
She do what I say so, now
She fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo
Send that RIP, out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo
Back when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow
Now I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh
I used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby
Yeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I think of me and you

[Verse: Jean Deaux]
I don't know what's better, I won't say what's worse
Pen is like a needle when I bleed these words
I could make a blessing if I spit this verse
That's why I be retching 'til I rid my curse
Black it be the sweetest
Secrecy up in the frequencies
That's why you feel the need
To look at me like I'm a deity
Duality is key, you see
That I'm seein' you seein' me
So now we seeing equally
Needlessly to say
I hate that we're meeting this way
Feel like I packed up to go
'Bout a week ago
I don't know
If I switch my flow I might tap into the pinnacles
I'm sellin' syllables, I'm losing principles
Lurkin', searching for miracles
Hurtin' workmen, curtain closed
Earn a million dollars just to owe it to some imbeciles
If they tell me no, I be dumb, all I hear is go
Crossfire coming but I'm pigeon-toed, winter froze

[Chorus: Bari]
I done went Murda Mike, on the may-a-ooo, uh
She on the payroll, he on the payroll
I want queso, I want the caseload
She do what I say so, now
She fucked up, yeah, she might do the Fabo
Send that RIP, out yeah, and that shit for Shawty Lo
Back when I was broke I had to pour that Bacardi slow
Now I'm on the board, niggas salty like margaritas, ooh
I used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I'm thinking bout when it was me and you, baby
Yeah, used to dream about the coupe, baby
Now I think of me and you

[Bridge: Smino]
Cunning linguistics
Punishing puns
Pumping the petro, gas in my lungs
Loving the low times, higher than a mug
Up in the cabinet
Imagine a baby reaching his hands up to grab it
A pipe done busted in heaven
And got to leaking out blessings
Reaching my hands up to grab it
Re'in my bands up
Uh, uh

[Verse: Noname]
Sunny metropolis, overzealous as telefone
Telefone a new continent, maybe rode me a rocketship
Copper all on my dash, and he ticket that lady optimist
Said I'm moving too fast, slow down, slow down
Opened up for Lauryn Hill, woah now, woah now
Woah now
Everything is everything and the object steady mystified
My allegories underneath the rock will only fear resides
I bet I'm gon' find it, I know I'm gon' find it
Happiness, bank account, white accountant
I found the fountain
I was born in all black, how could God denounce this?
I told Him, 'Give me my money, I need my money now'
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
I know you gifted me the gift of gab and simile
And simpleness, the solitude is loneliness
Been good to me
I told them, 'Give me my happy, I need my holy now'
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
Thank you Jesus, whoever you are
