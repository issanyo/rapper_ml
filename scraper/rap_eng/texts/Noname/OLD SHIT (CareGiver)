[Verse 1]

I write a song about my soul, and I tell you
I know the other side of mother side
Pulling up pampers til memories collide
You ever see a lost mind skip like a tune?
All time fade-away, Alzheimer's afternoon
In a room of walls get skicky as it's my house
The couch don't love me, the couch don't love me. It need me
I swear to God I don't remember my name. A gypsy
On the sidewalk with a hump, and a cane
What's a melody for art like this? Arthritis
Care-giver on a Sunday, a hood bitch JK
I left the hoodie in the crib. Fuck it

[Verse 2]

When I see my name in the lights, on a night
When the moon bright, and the stars out; You can carve out a piece of my soul
It's gold like Jay Elect
Presidente, El Camino to the Kinsey
Sixteen bars in sixteen seconds, I dream rap
All my metaphors got three wings it's angel pretty
Dangle with me from the gates unseen. Aunt Pearly, it's early
And my God says goodmorning. Smelling like dime bags
And rapping like young Lauryn. Prolific


[Verse 3]

Dark liquor brands, rap game, the new Grandy
Dark metaphors, Noname the new nanny
You got a dollar? I could watch your granny, and her kid's kids
Both where they live, both in a bib
Cause rap money ain't money; temporary stage life
I fell in love with metaphors, temporary page wife
First verse was about my old job
Second verse was about a new God, who gone be that
Half drunk profit; Profiting where the weed at?

New Jazz Similie....
Lullaby the babies with the Similac & Hennessy
Bitter sweet, cause everything ain't about twerking
Unless everything is about twerking
