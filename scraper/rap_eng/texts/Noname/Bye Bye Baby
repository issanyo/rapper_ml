[Verse 1]
Interview, interlude in the nude with my boo thang
Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
I swear he love me, my tummy almost got ready
For biddi-baby spaghetti and teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile
Before you leave, don't look down
God will help you spread your wings

[Hook]
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey

[Verse 2]
Ask me why she said goodbye, why baby dyin' white walls
Cigarettes over skyfall, writing this life, this my song
Ask me why she hesitated, almost waited, waiting room
Play date up to heaven soon, soon I will see the King
He reminds me, some give presents before they're even ready
I could see that she loves me, I know her heart is heavy

[Outro]
Telefone-ication nation, baby help me testify
Oooh you know I hate goodbye
Bye bye blue, somebody let the yellow in
Bye bye blue, I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
Telefone-ication nation, baby help me testify
Oooh you know I hate goodbye
Bye bye blue, somebody let the yellow in
Bye bye blue, I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
