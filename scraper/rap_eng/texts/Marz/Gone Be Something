[Intro]
Everything next level
Everything next level
Everything I do gotta be next level
Everything I do gotta be next level
Even when I die, I'mma be that nigga
Even when I die, I'mma be that nigga

[Hook]
I like to book first class one way flights
No looking back's the key to life, uh
I feel like whoo! Can't tell me nothing
Feel like whoo! I'm gone be something

[Verse 1]
Look, he talking crazy like he be that nigga
Nigga stop playing, you don't see them figures?
Everybody round wanna be that nigga
Weak ass squads wanna be my team

Nigga please, I been the nigga long time
Nigga please, I been the nigga, aye
Nigga please, I been the nigga long time
Nigga please, uh hey!
Shit sound good but you niggas only speaking
Nigga talking bout he working but I never ever seen him
I be outchea rolling stones, young nigga so it seems
See the baby ain't mine, treat her ass like Billie Jean
I'mma call the shots like a motherfucking king
See the shit only pop when real niggas hit the scene
Living lawless and never flawed, and sho I'mma ball
Came up ruthless, these diamonds flawless, we deserve all this
Ones that I was making and never taking up for
And that's a soldier, we always rolling close up on ya
Rise up, we waking niggas up like Folger's
Falcons, a desert eagle, and a holster
Coasting, this that loaded candy coat
On the block, they gon' call me E the Cosa Nostra
Fuck with me, I'm the hostest with the most
Nigga what the fuck you mean? I talk that dope, aye!

[Verse 2]
Bust a hole, this cap and ball, uh
Focus, I'm on Adderall, nah
That sound good cause that is all y'all
Police out here picking up and killing the chillin
That's no threat at all y'all
Looks to me like ya don't stand for this
Y'all niggas ain't that involved
Guess it's time for some street protocol, ears to the street
A dollar that you earned and you spent ain't shit
My attitude is "fuck it" cause motherfuckers love it
That ain't no pussyfooting, stick to the motherfucking subject
I swear there ain't no other niggas in ya trap like this
The world fucked up with the preconceived notion
That ya gonna make it if ya only act like this
If ya ask me, that's some fucking horse shit
You turn they fucking thoughts to a fucking force rip
Shit taught in class wasn't making no sense
My history gotta be bigger than a muh textbook
Let alone a motherfucking chapter
They fail to tell they children bout before and after
The prophet father tell me y'all some fucking bastards
Until we rally up and we demand for answers, hey!
I must confess, this shit outta whack, uh
Follow me, we gon get it back, uh
