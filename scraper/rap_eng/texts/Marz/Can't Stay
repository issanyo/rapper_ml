[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'ma take my time, baby I'ma do it right
Even if it’s gone take all damn night
Then I was thinking we could do it in my Jeep
Imma hit the spots that your ex couldn’t reach
And I put that on the set
I know what to do to get your little pussy wet
Bae why you flexing, you know why I came
Stop acting stupid, I ain’t with the games (You know I want you bad)
Don’t front you know
Girl you know you want it just as bad as I do
Don’t front you know
You know you want it

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I can’t stay till the morning
But I promise I won’t rush on you
Can’t stay till the morning
But I'ma take my time on you
I got you screaming yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: T.I.]
That’s right girl, all you’re gonna hear from me is, "Alright"
While you’re here with me
You say you want it all night, I say, "Alright"
So you think you can deal with me?
Say you want it all day, I say, "Ok, ok
"You say you like to be manhandled, I’ll give you all that you can handle
"I’m a rich nigga, no panhandle, alright"
Ay, let me holler at you, shawty
When you ask her could we chill after the club and she say, "Alright"
("What you mean by that?")
Well then I ask her if she do it with a girl and she say, "No way"
And then I say, "Is that a fact?
"What if I give you both a couple racks?
"Let her wear a strap on, give it to you from the back
"A hit of molly ought to make you change your mind bout that"
And she say, "Alright"
Take it right now if you want
Feel the pressure all in your rib cage, don’t it
Started kissing on her from the top
Getting hugged, get it slapping, let me see you go way down on it
(She say, "Alright")
Can you ever say no all night? ("Alright")
You ever think that everybody cum twice? ("Ok")
Get a bank roll right before I go cause I’m out of here before sunlight

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I can’t stay till the morning
But I promise I won’t rush on you
Can’t stay till the morning
But I'ma take my time on you
I got you screaming yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
If your girl’s talking shit about me
I’m debating which one I want to take with me
And I’m a greedy nigga so I want it all day
My stamina a go, girl you know I’m a beast
