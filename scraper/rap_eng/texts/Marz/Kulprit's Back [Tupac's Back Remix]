Kulprit’s back. Kulprit’s back
That’s all the people screamin’ that Kulprit’s back
All eyes on me. Swagged up and I’m riding
Ain’t heard the fresh to def flow. Keezy where you been hiding?
The love the way I be rapping. Yeah, they calling it crazy
Swagknowledged all over. Even the ones who hate me
They screaming Kulprit’s back. Kulprit’s back
That’s all the people screaming that Kulprit’s back

[Verse]
Kulprits back. Bet. Not fiction it’s fact
Blowing up mics like I was from Iraq
And if you heard my songs you know im never whack
I got them fans getting hype like the crowd was on crack
I got too much steez. Cruising on the Old Nash Bule in my T
Back with a vengeance they screaming “DKD”!
I tell em where I'm from you know. “It’s Tennessee”
Go against me, n****. Pay that price
Go on Roll them dice
Frostbite on my neck cause I got too much ice
I’m on this beat. Like white on rice
I got my music no kush. To get me high as a kite
Plotting on this new mixtape. Never retire from spitting
Wallet fat in the pocket. Having a hard time fitting
I see what rappers are doing and change my mind about quitting
Somebody gimmie a throne. I need a place to be sitting. They screaming
