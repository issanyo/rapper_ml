[Verse 1: Monoxide]
I hear the words are spoken, I think my mind is broken
I keep on steady smokin' hopefully I die from chokin'
Know what I was just thinkin'? Maybe if I keep drinkin'
The voice'll quit and I can escape from this demon deacon
My life's a living Hell, only the voice can tell
Oh please oh Christ compel, plead my from this evil spell
My body won't stop shakin', these voices keep on makin'
Me do things to people this must just be the work on Satan

[Verse 2: Jamie Madrox]
They want my mind and soul this shit is way out of control
I havn't been to sleep in week's, I'm sweatin' but my body's cold
I'm shakin' like a leaf, terrified to go to sleep
Pukin' from the medication, vital signs is lookin' weak
I seen him in a mirror, he told me come inside
He lives inside my head, so there's nowhere to hide
They want my soul to die, so they can come alive
Possess my body, so everyone will realize

[Hook: Dark Lotus]
They said they'll give me pain
They said they'll give me love
They said they'll make me bleed
They take me up above
They take me down again
This is my medicine
I cut the head off the Devil and i'll throw it at y'all x2

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Take so many Zoloft, I bleed my nose off
Run up in a church, and rip my fuckin' clothes off
The demon follows me right into the house of God
But then it swallows me and takes me to the Lotus Pod
What can I do? When my brains shakes my earth quakes
My lips crack, my skin dries up and flakes
Sleepless, 6 day's, and peep this
I pin my eyelids open, with rusty paperclips

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
The demons commin' for me, they wanna take my body
Hands reaching up behind me, suffercate the breathe, defy me
They squeeze my vocal cord, until' I want to scream
Call upon the dark lord, please wake me from my dream
I'm steady poppin' No-doze, I never wanna sleep
Mental pressure overcomes the brain, the evil creeps
Body shakes me out control, I need to pop another pill
Demons here to take my soul, to late I need a refill

[Interlude: Jamie Madrox]
Spoken are the words
In the hands of pythona
Are the magic spells
To unlock the keys to the universe
It awaits, it will be summoned
By the petals of the Lotus
The night candles clean mind and soul
Shall invoke the power

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I sit alone in the closet so I could hear what they said
I'm rockin' back and forth, helpless will it infest my head
My momma told it would pass within 17 days
The bag  of the Tylonal bottles don't say shit about a soul rape
Tell me what the fuck I'm supposed to do now?
Act how? Go where? Be with who? Listen more to me or you?
Father tell me when ever will I be back to normal? (never)
I guess I'm cursed to live with this headache, forever

[Verse 6: Marz]
I'm hearin' thoughts spin
Whispers screamin' voices from inside of my mind
I wake up in a day's blood,and scars on my arms
I feel sick, with someone else's memories
They beg me, to kill everything I see
I got visions of nun's being raped
With the barrels of guns, a young lamb crucified for the fuck of it
It fills me, I can't sleep
I can't eat, I can't breathe, someone save me!

[Chorus] - 2X

(Violent J)
Give me pain
Give me love
Make me bleed
Take me above
Take me down
"I cut the head off the Devil and i'll throw it at y'all" (4X)
