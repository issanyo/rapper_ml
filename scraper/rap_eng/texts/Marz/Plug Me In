[Chorus: Mr. Every Day]
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?

[Verse 1: Kharakter]
I got em mayne
Tell em I'm on one, I'm too fresh though
Ya boy Dre be on beast mode nigga
No playground my nigga slide bro
I'm sky high with my eyes low
Riding around with my day ones
Man I never trusted these new niggas
Niggas dead tried to stop my shine
But like a running back I run straight thru 'em
Man I’m so hot I cause a solar flair
Stay fresh no tupperwear
Man I'm on grass, no John Deer nigga
My flow cold, homie, polar bear
Man I'm sick without that flu
Man I'm crazy without that glue
Man it's light work, man I thought you knew
I get out of pocket like Michael Vick do
Nigga with clause dropped
After these verses your jaw dropped
Man I'm raw hot, man I'm atomic, nuclear, solar, supernova hot
Past Life up in this bitch
Nigga show me show me my opponent
And I am killing this game and will not give em no condolence
We don't brag and boast nigga
We just fly like ghosts nigga
Bars like we under oath nigga
Comedy Central roast niggas
Man I put my heart in this
Mayne I spit flames just like an arsonist
Come and dive in the talent pool man
The lake of these piranha fish
Man let's get the shit ....

[Chorus: Mr. Every Day]
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?

[Verse 2: Mr. Every Day]
Yeah man, yeah it's my time
Yeah I know you been waiting
I'm about to set it off
You should've known I was coming
You gon' learn today
Lets go!
Mr. Every Day, you know I'm in the mix
They just called me in, said to get it quick
Ain't got too much time, gotta keep my timing
Cuz you only get one shot with this fucking rhyming
So I kick in the door and I don’t care what the fuck y'all do
Cuz when I grab the mic I'm killing this shit, clap three or four
And then let's go, straight out the do'
I put it together, I’m the plug fa sho
I’m witnessing this game and it's full of shit
And I don’t give a fuck 'cuz I’m killing it (let's go)
I move like a beast in any weather
I tear up shit when I’m around, you see me, I can do whatever
I got carte blanche in this bitch
What’s a bro to do but get rich? (Rich) (Rich)
I’m rewriting the testament, my spirit's climbing
I can see right through your face, that’s how I know you lying
The force got me fearless in this game
I’m Mr. Every Day Kanobe, Luke’s in the plane
I’m so strategic, North, South, East, and West
I roll with Hennessy and that’s cuz they the best
You don’t give a fuck? Well listen up, I do
I can see right through your motherfucking side view
And now I’m down and yeah, its foreva
(Yo Ev, you wild)
Beheskedede! Whatever!
They pull me in
Is it a sin?
I’m in to win
God bless the chin
I’m in the light
I’m seeing shit / (Radio: "Are they Tweeting this?)
I’m the motherfucking plug
Now let's get in

[Chorus: Mr. Every Day]
Now plug me in, hey, now plug me in, hey
Now plug me in, hey, now plug me in, hey
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?
Which one of y'all up here is the plug?

[Outro: Mr. Every Day]
Yeah man, you know what I’m saying mayne. Its Mr. Every Day, you already know Kharakter. That’s right, we on that futuristic. Defiant, it's Past Life. I told you I got 'em, you already know I was the plug. Let's go! And if you ain't know, now you know. Nobody can do what I do. That’s a fact. The one and only, Mr. Every Day
