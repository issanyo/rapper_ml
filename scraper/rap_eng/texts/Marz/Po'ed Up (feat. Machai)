[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad and she bougie then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no

[Verse 1: Paris]
You ain't know, bet you know now
Fuck you mean you don't know us?
Fell in love with a bank, she wanna lay where I stay
I want all of my cake

[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah, I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad and she boujee then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no

[Bridge: Paris]
I keep losin' all my shit
All night long I'm on my way, yeah, so keep
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' all the time, yeah
Hope I see tomorrow, how the hell could I know?
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' all the time, yeah
Hope I see tomorrow, how the hell could I know?

[Verse 2: Machai]
I just be feelin' myself, uh
I can do better myself, uh
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, uh
I woke up today and I just broke another bank
Diamond choker, homie, yeah, your bitch just broke my chain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Chorus: Paris]
Ayy, watch me fade every day in the mornin'
2 a.m., yeah, I'm sippin' and I'm zonin'
Watch me move, watch me sway, watch me dip out
In a room full of girls I'm tryna dig out
I just broke all the banks and now I'm po'ed up
If she bad and she boujee then she know us
That ain't love, that ain't trust, that ain't me, though
Feel a way about you, I don't need ya, no
