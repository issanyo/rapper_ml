[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
But I'm calling all night and you ain't pickin' up this time
Thinkin' about all the things you've done
See, I done went to the point of no return, babe
Cause I can't take my actions back now
Oh, no, what are we gonna do now, the love is so lost, yeah
But I'm calling all night and you ain't pickin' up
Only God knows where you at
My friend's tellin' me to just let it go
Let you calm, let you take a break
And maybe things will turn around
I see I done went to the point of no return
And you don't even know
Yeah, I done fucked up this time, baby
Oh, yes, I did

[Hook]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
You had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night and I ain't pickin' up this time
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night, but I ain't takin' you back this time
Oh no no

[Future:]
But even roses die, I can see the light
When you're further
Deep in the valley of the shadow of death
I got yo back like you got mine, baby
And fuck everything else
And I just wanna fuck yo mind baby fuck everything else
And just as long as you ain't cryin', baby fuck everything else
Fuck everything else
I had a time when God has told me
These Audemar Piguets and rings don't mean a thing
I switched it up, got princess cut
That shit don't mean a thing
She on my nuts, she saying you can't keep yo dick in yo jeans
Free Band Gang

[Hook]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
You had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night, but I ain't pickin' up this time
Oh no no, every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night, but I ain't takin' you back this time
Oh, no no

[Outro]
Every time I looked in yo eyes, baby
I thought that you really loved me deep
But see that's some shit you don't gotta teach
Yeah, baby
Lovin' you all night long, it feels so good
But I gotta let it go, see I gotta practice what I preach
Oh, this is my love song
Y'all bitches wanted that didn't ya.....
