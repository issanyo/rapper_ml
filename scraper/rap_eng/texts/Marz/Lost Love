Im sorry I broke you to pieces
Im sorry I broke you apart
But lately I swear that I’m feeling
Some distance were drifting apart
From nothing to something
Our love is just painted on canvas
They call it pure love
Of all the emotions
We spill from our hearts
I wonder if well make it that far
We used to dream big
From children to marriage
That shit was so big
But now were not talking
I guess you don’t feel
The same way I feel
The pictures we’ve painted
Are shattered for years
And The way that i feel
Is nothing but fear
I need you to listen
I need you right here
I want you to tell me
That you’ll be okay
Without you I’m lonely
I need you to stay
I know you don’t love me
I’m losing my brain
I hated the fact
That you left me in pain

I’m lonely without you
You made up my world so complete

You tell me you love me
And then you pack up and just leave

I’m high off of drugs
A mixture of Norco, and Morphine and Weed

To kill of the pain
That broke me to pieces I don’t wanna breath

I’m sorry I tried to
Intentionally love you
It’s all just a lie to you
Im hating the fact that I’m breaking to pieces
For someone that’s like you

Yeah

Yeah
