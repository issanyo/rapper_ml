[Verse 1: Maryanne Dimech]
I've got a crime to commit with you, honey
It ain't love, it is pure sin
Sentence me to life behind your prison bars

Sing me your beautiful melodies under the blazing stars
Rock me, I'm falling from gravity
Under your spell

[Chorus: Maryanne Dimech]
I wanna be under your body, under your skin
Under your influence
Under your body, under your skin
Under your cool

This love has gone haywire
And my body's getting tired
Just waiting for you to turn me on
Plug me in and shock me all night long

[Verse 2: Maryanne Dimech]
My mind is a mine, honey
Ready to explode
With all the things that I keep imprisoned inside

Even maximum security could never figure me out
Aow-aow-aow! Officer down!
We're gonna be free now

[Chorus: Maryanne Dimech]

[Bridge: Maryanne Dimech]
Head over heels, body over mind
Losing my cool, mad over you
Head over heels, body over mind
Losing my cool, mad (mad! mad!)

[Bridge: Noah Fence]
I said fuck what you heard, I'm not like your ex
Push play, stop, rewind, there won't be a next
Got dirt on my mind when my mind's on the sex
So uncuff me, let's begin, take it off now, flex

[Chorus: Maryanne Dimech]
