Fuck the fashion boy this Glock what I'm rocking
Say you designer down when we know you window shopping
Acting like you bullet proof boy we hear you talking
Two to his chest lungs flooded now he coughing
On the block with the shots , call me oladipo
50-1-50 like my hammer from Home Depot
Treat my chopper like a baby riding in the back seat
12 pull up on me skirting off you can't catch me

(BRIDGE)

Look me in my eyes you ain't gone do it
Pull up on you boy you pussy we gone prove it
(Repeat 4x)

(Cameronazi VERSE)

Hold up let me talk my shit we sending shots at you boy and you know we don't miss
You a broke nigga , seen your ass in a lift while I was swerving down the block on my Tokyo drift
You a broke nigga, now shut up don't talk to me get your bread up
You a broke nigga, now shut up don't talk to me get your bread up
You a broke nigga, now shut up don't talk to me get your bread up
