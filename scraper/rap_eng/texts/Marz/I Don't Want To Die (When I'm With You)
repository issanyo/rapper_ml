(Intro)
She always was talking about these crazy things
And I never understood a word she said
All I understood, that she was the girl
I stayed up every night thinking about
And when I'm with her I feel happy to be alive, like I can do anything
Even talk to you like this
So that's what I think is love, mom
And I'm better because she's here

(Verse 1: B!rRCH TR33)
Yeah this lil boy he wanna go go
I gotta take my bitch to the store store
Gotta buy Gucci, gotta by her some clothes clothes
I need new shoes, and my new hoes
Oh my god we so close
Walking in a room and I'm feeling so close
Feeling right, I'm feeling right
Doing tons of drugs tonight
Mix'n up all that shit
Liquor with a pill in it
Oh my god, fucking shit
I'm gonna loose my fucking shit

(Verse 2: Marz)
With you I feel alive, for a second I don't wanna die (I'm scared)
You loved me when I couldn't love myself
Wish you could hold me like that when I'm by myself
You got me on your vibe, so I got you on my mind
Baby I don't wanna die, when I'm with you
Got me feeling so alive
Cuz I got you by my side
Boy you making me so blind
Cuz you're with me

(Bridge: Marz)
Stay with me right here
Keep me with you, near
Hold me, oh so dear
Hide me from my fears
