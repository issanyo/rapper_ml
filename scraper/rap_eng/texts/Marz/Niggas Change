[Chorus]
Niggas change, Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas change

Niggas change, Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas change


[Verse 1]
I was.. Reminiscing way back to the days
When my niggas had ways and they never got played

It was bout Grade 1 we were chilling with a bunch, 
Waiting for the minute to hit numero 30 for the lunch

We were homies in the day, but niggas during night
Going back and forth tile know the shit was right

We were close as fuck like a fam with no fuss
Nothing could stop or come right between us 

No problem no issues, goes above them
I had love for them niggas like why would i dog them

High school was up next, we were playing spots
Separating all the pentings, and the ugly thots

We would spit in a group as we dropping tracks
We brothers in the making had each others backs

  My one and only homies and never had a doubt
Had a future in their minds and it was all planned out
 
Number 1 was full of shit mostly all bull
They said gonna study hard and make it thru school

2 was a joke that can put u in ur bed
Never fuck around with them niggas called the corny as feds

3 was the worst cos it rhymes with hugs (they were like)
Better not get into them stupid ass drugs

And I’m like yh brothers thats how it suppose to be
Y’all thinking straight now y’all can clearly see

Follow those goals for urself to achieve
Then y’all live a sustainable life eventually 

But you know me I be talking to much I be joking too much
Speaking so messed up, you be thinking I’m dutch
  
Like Mamba splash clutch
Killin niggas so smooth like I’m starsky and hutch

Not a slayer Im a king bow down
Leave me lets get back to the story now



[Hook]
So tune in now matter fact its reality
Story so fucked, u be thinking its insanity 

Their dream left behind now they trynna be rich 
Drugs pulled them in quick like it was a hot bitch

Started of with a puff “like, nigga you want some”
Then ”Hmm I don’t smoke but yh, ill hit one”

“Just for fun” “But the fun is all done”
“Till you get caught lacking cos you puffed on that one”

ITS A WRAP SON!

[Chorus]
Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas change

Niggas change, Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas change

[Verse 2]
So as I stated well you better not change, Cos emma murk all y’all niggas from the top of the range
It ain't menace 2 society killing in hoods, Im just stating change can be bad or change can be good

You left school and work, your fam call you a choke, h;anging out with ur mate with no education and u broke

As the years pass by, you need the dollar dollar bill,but you broke remember, so now you going for the steal

You hustle all these people just to get a meal, I ain't making this up, you know this shit is real

But you don't listen, you think all of this will heal, next thing u get a gun bang you going for the kill

A nigga killed over here, a nigga killed over there, This rap tape ain't for laughs ghee cos this shit ain't fair

Playing your family blind bro its like u don’t care, don’t be betting on your life, cos your life ain't a dare

PEACE!

[Chorus]
Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas change

Niggas change, Niggas change I ain't preaching but we know niggas change
Hooked on the filth shit, actin like they not, but I ain't preaching cos we know niggas
Change
