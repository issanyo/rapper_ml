[Verse 1]
Nigga I just pulled off in the whip
Yo, I’m cool with Mexicans, but never on a fence
What would Jesus do? its always on my wrist
Solo para Dios, que sabe what it is
Devil thought he sold me guacamole and some chips
I know that I’m unholy Lord, my spirit need a cleanse
I just talked to pops and he said "Ryan how ya been?"
And focus on the job son, you gotta watch ya friends
Niggas claiming that they warriors, but they ain’t in the trench
They hate to see you scoring, bruh, now ain’t that bout a bitch
These niggas never ballin man, I guess they love the bench
Homie, Hundo in the game I’m bout to turn up like a wrench

[Hook]
You should know I’m really with the shits
Man they hating on the kid, its just an excuse
You should know I’m really with the shits
Dawg it is what it is, I got nothing to lose
You should know I’m really with the shits
Now they coming for my head, want me up in a noose
You should know I’m really with the
You should know I’m really…with the…

[Verse 2]
Teenagers turned into hashtags, I see kids getting killed
Aborted babies in hashtags, I know satan is real
Don’t breathe the air, get a gas mask; yo its chemical trails
Dark clouds over my back, they want me to fail
I know they want me in jail, I know they’d rather me die
I know they probably gon kill me, them niggas already tried
But you I’m feeling like Jesus, nigga I’m still gonna rise
You hang the man from the tree, the mission gonna survive
You should know I’m really with the…with the with the
Illest niggas, stay true…never switch up
Right intentions; live by a different system
God sufficient; we don’t need assistance
Turn the pressure up, I be stepping up
I leveled up the damn thang
These devils up, ain’t stressing us
Fuck Donald Trump’s campaign
I’m never ever number 2, but I’m with the shits all day
Man i never ever lose, cruising right thru the lane…aye!

[Hook]
You should know I’m really with the shits
Man they hating on the kid, its just an excuse
You should know I’m really with the shits
Dawg it is what it is, I got nothing to lose
You should know I’m really with the shits
Now they coming for my head, want me up in a noose
You should know I’m really with the
You should know I’m really…with the…

[Outro]
Really really really real
Yeah
Really really really real
