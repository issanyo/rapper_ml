[VERSE 1]
Started from the bottom(x2)
Swear to God I'm gonna Make it up
Started from the bottom(x2)
I was broke I ain't have enough
Started from the bottom(x2)
Swear to God I'm gonna Make it up
Started from the bottom(x2)
On the ground but swear I'm gone get up
Go make all the change
That I couldn't do
Remember I was struggling
I ain't have no food
Go get all the Jays
Yea I wanted shoes
Go do all the things that I couldn't do

[Chorus]
Yea I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
(X4)

[VERSE 2]
There was many many people
That would never lend a hand out
Now they always asking for a handout
Tryna show and tell
Like are we friends now?
Where were you when I couldn't put the lean down?
Going super San!
When I couldn't hear how
Kissing ass to the Prince
Saying bow down
You ain't digging in my pants
Get yo hand out
Talkin shit, taking xans
I'm the man now
Tryna roll it on me
Like I ain't Got heavy duty
Whistle come here to the rat
Is how they put it on me
Just tryna get it Where I'm at
So I say no to cutting
You can stay right where you at
Red light. So go with dummies

[Chorus]
Yea I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
(X4)

[VERSE 3]
Proud is my family
I swear I'm in demand
Put that finger up
The Malcolm like the middle of my hand
If the writing on the wall
Man You sinking in the sand
Oh Kirby Kirby you just lost a life
Cause in the Man
Do you see a troller on me
I ain't playing games
I'm talking game of life
That's What I'm praying
Listen to my sayings
Man they Said that I wouldn't make
Now I made it out the USA
Revenge is mines
Cause success how how I rue the day

[Chorus]
Yea I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
Now I'm up
Swear I'm up
(X4)
