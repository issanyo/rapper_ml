[Intro: Rama]
I want, I want someone just to stay and I know that it’s not possible right now like we don’t even know what love means

[Verse 1: TwoThreeFive]
Left me thinking all alone never called to let you know
And now I see you blowing up my phone gotta keep my distance yo I had these thoughts that led me on again,but I know that you need him

[Interlude : Rama]
Would you give up your fucking stubborn headass to say like okay yes let’s have a title

[Verse 2: TwoThreeFive]
And you lying but you break my heart, saw right through you from the start
And these feelings that I kept at bay shine right through and make a way
But lord knows we still walk our ways ( All alone I don’t hate you I still love you though)
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
