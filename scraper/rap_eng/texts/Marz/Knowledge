(Intro)
People have been fake
People have been hating on me
Been telling me what to do
I had many friends without knowledge
---- (Mars)
But now
They tryna tell me the way I should go
They telling me that my texts don't make any sense
It's obvious they won't make sense if you ain't got no knowledge

Hook:
I make you feel like I am fine
Young M.A makes my daily vibe
Your happiness like funny vine
Yea exactly not for long time
Y'all know I am always online
Watching Instagram for some dime..
I got the knowledge
I got the knowledge
I got the knowledge
I got the knowledge
Broke people tryna act like rich
Today's everything savage..


Verse 1:
Wanna achieve that for you granny,(peace)
For me
For our family,( la familia)
Wanna go really deep
Haters ask me oh really?( for real?)
Wanna walk like a simple beat,(poetry)
Teach 'em people like voluntary
Don't have to use a cheat
Wanna wear that gucci like a Jimmy..
History on me Carravagio
Wanna be happy like Lennon John
I'm still like where she gone, (gone)
Wanna talk to 'em, but they're like hang on,( hang on )
I'm saying who've set your throne
Why you tryna break my zone
Why you tryna hate my home ..

(Hope)

I understand 'em people like Frederick Skinner
I wanna be always winner
'Em people, like a simple printer, (copier)
I'm the real fashion killer,(skrt, skrt)
Distance of success like nile river,(long)
I Ain't got time for that liquor,( nah nah)
I Ain't got time for her
I'm just that advice giver
Who's tryna be just rap singer..

She wants me out on date,( date )
Girl wanna be my bae, bae gotta wait
This chick got horrible rate, (urhh)
I rather buy a another bape
I rather do a mixtape
I rather keep my name
I Ain't tryna be someone's bait
I Ain't tryna be her slave
I Ain't tryna be her fate
Don't wanna see her everyday..

(cuz?)

She ain't trippin
She a unique sko
There's water, she ain't sippin
This fake friendly flow
She should get some real whippin
Heartless girl doesn't feel woe
Father's girl needs a new thing
Broke friend isn't your bro
Broke friend equal no expensive shopping..
