[Intro]
Marz
Yuh

[Chorus]
If a nigga like me pull up in the hooptie
Would you think any different?
Think any different
And you pull up on me, new bags and new keys
Kinda funny how we don't talk no more
Cause you think a little different, think a little different

[Bridge]
I ain't seen you in a while, you looking different
And I don't know know know nothing at all
And you calling me when you know I'm not home
And I know and I know and I know know know know

[Chorus]
If a nigga like me pull up in the hooptie
Would you think any different? (think any different)
Think any different (oh)
And you pull up on me, new bags and new keys
Kinda funny how we don't talk no more
Cause you think a little different, (think a little different)
Think a little different

[Verse]
You don't wanna be alone, nah
You the one that a nigga wanna hold down
I bet you wanna post now, yuh
On the gram girl, can you put your phone down?
Girl I wanna talk to you, talk to you
It can be me, you, and your friends
It ain't even gotta stop with you, stop with you
I mean anything is possible
Smokin', drinkin', it's a lot to do
But of course this shit is optional
None of these niggas is obstacles
None of these bitches is on to you
None of these bitches is on to you

[Chorus]
If a nigga like me pull up in the hooptie
Would you think any different? (think any different)
Think any different (oh)
And you pull up on me, new bags and new keys
Kinda funny how we don't talk no more
Cause you think a little different, (think a little different)
Think a little different

[Outro]
Yuh
I'm back on the road and I thought you should know that these niggas ain't close to me
Text on my phone and your girl all alone and she tell me that openly
She not coming home, now you calling her phone and she answer that hopefully
Fuck all of y'all that switched up on the boy yeah you niggas are ghosts to me
Dropping my top and your boy out the top yeah I'm right where I'm s'posed to be
