Marz

[Verse 1: N3llie]
Wake up to my phone buzzing
Niggas in a cold oven
Niggas in a cold world
But Ima keep so hunned
Cuz I got my shawty with me
She said she gon ride with me
Through the struggle and the good
She said she gon die with me
If we broke she gon get fly with me
Smoke some more come get high with me
No one gon disrespect her in my city
Hustling grinding from the bottom
All these other hoes girl u top em
Here's my Instagram if you gotta block em
They all hating tryna stop us
But ain't gon do shit
Baby girl we to ruthless
All these fakes posting for the Gram
I swear to God, they so useless
I don't even know what we doing
We just sit back, enjoy the music
I just sit back and stare at her
She gon hold me down that's why I'm with her

[Hook x2: N3llie]
If I gotta steal she gon steal with me
If I gotta kill she gon kill with me
She gon hold me down
She gon hold me down
They all mad cuz she still with me

[Verse 2: N3llie]
I'm like in this generation
Getting out the hood is when we start vacation
Trappin' out the mud ain't no hesitation
She was with me from the start no playing
Flood her out with some red bottoms
She the main one call her Blossom
She gon shoot you if u start problems
She my baby call her Madonna
Sippin' this lean that she poured for me
When I fall she helps me to my feet
When I'm hungry she gon cook for me
And all this dope she gon smoke with me
She gon hold me down cuz no one did
She gon support me like I'm the bid
She gon love me like I'm her kid
We done fell in love no Cupid
Ima stick with her through the end of time
Im selfish cuz I keep what's mine
We in the dark we gonna shine
I'm loving her cuz she by my side
(God Damn, She gon hold me down)

[Hook x2: N3llie]
If I gotta steal she gon steal with me
If I gotta kill she gon kill with me
She gon hold me down
She gon hold me down
They all mad cuz she still with me

[Verse 3: N3llie]
Ain't no one can slay on my baby nah
My girl Curvy and thick as fuck
Hustling for this money we won't ever stop
I'm gon have the key she gon have the lock
With her pretty eyes that she always rolls
We gon never stop cuz we on a roll
Ima crack this blunt and shawty gonna roll
Feeling types of ways that I never felt before
And all i see is green and my baby
Counting all this money and smoking some weed
Gonna take her out everyday for free
We only shop expensive at Giuseppe
Get her some Vickie and an Audemar
On another planet I think we on Mars
She saw the ops came close and she rammed their car
Looking at my baby like a fucking star
(My baby a fucking star, She gon hold me down

[Hook x2: N3llie]
If I gotta steal she gon steal with me
If I gotta kill she gon kill with me
She gon hold me down
She gon hold me down
They all mad cuz she still with me
