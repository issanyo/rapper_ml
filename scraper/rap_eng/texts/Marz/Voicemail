[Verse 1]
Have you tried
Not to end my name with a sigh
You could blow trees down
With the air coming from your frown

[Pre-Chorus]
So please don’t lie to me
Cause then you’d cry for me

[Chorus]
So I’ll leave you alone
Like you’ve always known
You’ll be on your own
You wouldn’t even know

[Verse 2]
Have you tried
To look and find
A way to know
But then maybe you’d go

[Pre-Chorus]
So please don’t lie to me
Cause then you’d cry for me

[Chorus]
I’ll leave you alone
Like you’ve always known
You’ll be on your own
You wouldn’t even know
