[Intro - T.I. and Ciara]
Police where did you find this
I'm so done
I'm through
It's your fault
It's you

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear

{Verse 1 - Ciara]
I'm packing up boy I gotta leave
Gave you my heart and my soul I gave everything
Spend so much time in the streets
You lied you creep
And I stayed here with you
Don't wanna do this to my family
They wanna see us together living happily
But you are so unfair
You show no care
And that's why I am through

[Pre-Chorus - Ciara]
All the pain
All these years
I hate to walk away
But I gotta say goodbye my dear
I'm so done with you

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear

{Verse 2 - T.I.]
We've been going through
This so long and you
Don't listen to me so
Now I'm showing you

Think you will and it ain't nigga gonna do

All the years I've been knowing you
Look at how we live and look what you've got me going through

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear

[Bridge - T.I. and Ciara]
First we fuss and we fight and we break up
Then we kiss and make love and we make up
Do this over and over
But no more shorty this time I'm for sure
First we fuss and we fight and we break up
Then we kiss and make love and we make up
Do this over and over
But no more shorty this time I'm for sure

[Chorus - T.I. and Ciara]
Then you can never ever say I ain't game my love
And never say that I don't care
Since the beginning I've been here I ain't changed my love
Regardless of what you may feel
Us breaking up today it would be a shame my love
Don't think it's such a good idea
But if you won't show me that you appreciate my love
I'll have to say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear, my dear
Say goodbye my dear

[Outro - Ciara]

Even did it around for you
