[Intro: Future]
Ransom
Oh yeah, wizard
Know what I'm sayin'?
Feel like motherfuckin' avatar, nigga
Mercury, Pluto, yeah, yeah
On Pluto
Ear Drummers

[Chorus: Future]
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today

[Verse 1: Future]
I dab on these niggas with no doors
You hidin' the real, you behind doors
I can count every dollar up blindfolded
Beginnin' to end, I'm a giant (Freebandz)
I travel the world, change the climate (100)
My lil sister dealing with sickle cell
Hit me with a text just a few minutes ago
Say she love me, I told her I love her too
I can only imagine what she going through
And she got me on drank and the molly's too
Got that bitch out in penthouse and Follies too
Got a plug on the line with them models too
Got some trucks in the photo, a couple coupes
I'm a king and the one bitch will never do
I get love from Marcell all the way to Peru
Went through hell for this shit I'm long overdue
Have my youngin's pull up on you, sprayin' shit
I was coppin' it, buyin' it, weighin' it
All these foreigns, I drive, I'ma stay in it
Hit your bitch on the low, I'ma stay in it
I was so on the dope, hit that bitch on that dope
Gotta head in the door while I fucked on her throat
I smoke on an ounce and I pour up a 4
Hear what they like from the gutter, they got it
Love me or hate me, get richer than Pryor
No fronters, no necklace, my nigga will buy it
The plug tried to give it to us, we took it
I learned the game, nigga, then I got money
The chains and rings and they came from the pain
18 karat gold on my fangs
I hustle, deal with killers, stuck in my veins
Ran through 10 mil like the avenue

[Chorus: Future]
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today

[Verse 2: Future]
Fuck all these interviews, that shit commercial
Ayy, I run up with Murda
These niggas, they ready to whack so
Shit, I'm ready to stack some
I get money, young money hereditary
We had syrup in the 4 when they never did it
Had the molly's on Pluto, they never did it
Had them Percocets when you would never do it
Used to dream of the shit that you never do
Now I'm livin' the life that you never knew
Out my all red, don't open up every door
They got red on these carpets on every floor
Got a stash for them ratchets in every door
Took a half on a half, I went overdose
Sold a half for a bag, deal at your door
I go play in the place, they say, "Bonjour"
Knowin' knowin' exactly what I done before
If you shoot on command, I'ma love you more
All the dirt that I did, I try wash it off
When it come back to haunt me, I never know
Wish I knew all the day when the time would come
Ain't no friends in this game, it's another war
Put a whole 'nother style on another broad
Went to work for the love of my little boys

[Chorus: Future]
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today
I know I'm worth, I know I'm cursed
I hit the turf like a play on the first
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
You never mattered, no, you never mattered
Back and forth with that money like a paddle
Mollys and roxys, we call razzle dazzle
I'm making capital, I get collateral
Your head on a plate, we gon' come through today
