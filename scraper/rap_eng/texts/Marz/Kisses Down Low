[Verse 1]
You put in overtime, overnight
Doing everything I like, go so right, yeah
You hold me close, please me tight, look me deep inside my eyes
Baby, you know I love it
But nothing can compare to when you kiss me there
And I can't lie when I lie in your arms
Baby, I feel so sexy

[Pre-Chorus]
So boy just take your time
Send chills down my spine
You’re one of a kind
That’s why I gotta make you mine
Boy, you turn me on
Got me feeling hot
Now I’m really gone

[Chorus]
I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby get a little rough, that's okay
Baby go on ahead, do your thing
Ride on the wave
And I love it when we misbehave
Me and you together babe, we can do anything
Boy, if somebody could see the way you kiss on me
Oh, they won't believe it, 'cause even I don't believe it
But I love the way I’m feeling

[Pre-Chorus]
So boy just take your time
Send chills down my spine
You’re one of a kind
That’s why I gotta make you mine
Boy, you turn me on
Got me feeling hot
Now I’m really gone

[Chorus]
I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that

[Verse 3]
Speed it up, heat it up
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Till I get, get enough
You never know, never know, never know
I like that there
Yeah, that there
A little more to the left
Yeah, right there

[Pre-Chorus]
So boy just take your time
Send chills down my spine
You’re one of a kind
That’s why I gotta make you mine
Boy, you turn me on
Got me feeling hot
Now I’m really gone

[Chorus]
I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby, just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby, just like that

[Outro]
I like my kisses down low
I like my kisses down low
I like my, like my
I like my, like my...
I like my kisses down low
I like my, like my
I like my, like my...
I like my kisses down low
