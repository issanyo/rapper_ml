Hold on, I got my paper like a binder
Water on my neck might turn me to a scuba diver
I don't give a F like honor roll, i'm on a roll like tires
Running up the racks, but i'm never getting tired

She was sleeping on me, then she had a wet dream
Diamonds dancing on my wrist, I call it flex gleam
Can't take a L, cause I'm the shit like i'm digesting
Wait I only hit her up when I got an Erection

(Verse: Swaghollywood)
She goin' ride me like a bike
Baby come and get this pipe
I keep, lotta' guap yeah
Niggas mad they talk yeah

Can't fuck with you yeah you fu
I only be with my swoos
Cinco count up the loot
Pull off in a bentley coupe

Might put stars all up in my roof
They say lil swag he the fucking truth
We pull up hanging out the fucking roof
Dont make a nigga call up my troops

Yeah, these niggas they goin' shoot
They goin' pop at you
And your fuckin' dudes
You a fuckin' lame
You still sharing shoes
And I keep a bag
Like i'm in school

(Verse: CincoTheFlexGod)
Mix the comme des gar√ßon right with supreme
What you mean
Bitch I'm flooded, my neck hit you with a gleam
They wonder how I flex hard, I'm only seventeen
Watch me pull up in that *skrr* that you never ever seen (wait)

I just iced my neck I put a blimp up on my chain
They cannot believe it, yes I'm really getting paid
I say my pockets fat, i'm sorry for the weight
Just like they be eating wrong, my pockets out of shape

Bitch i'm on my way to the top now
You might catch me with lil swag with the top down yeah
I'm just blowing bands, I just forgot what I bought now
Damn my wrist so froze, yeah jack frost now

Why these niggas stealing sauce now
I just guess they seen me turn into a boss now
Got a couple chains, no telling what it cost now
Cinco flexing , so I cannot take a loss now
Yeah
