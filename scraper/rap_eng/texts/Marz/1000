[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hold up now listen
Hold up (oh) I want you to know how I'm feelin
(I want you)
We had a good thing going why you had to catch feelings?
And this the shit that I don’t know how to deal with
(I don't know how)
Now hold up shawty, why you trippin? I'm just keepin it a thousand

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
And you know what it was from the get go, you know what it was from the get go
Look how it was when we met, look how it was when we met
Man I wasn’t trynna kick it like that now
I told you that all fast now
No, you don't wanna hear none of that but I say with all due respect

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay let me kick something official to you
If you would take the time to listen to me
Look, [?] with honesty
And now said you weren't gon' act like this, you promised me
Did you forget our conversation where I told you you should manage your expectations? Be patient with me
Shawty I can't be your man but I can be a good damn friend
You know, hit me when you wanna hang out
Yeah you could pull up with your girl [?] the gang now
If it get late, you could stay here
But take your clothes, you don't stay here
I like you, I don't wanna bring you no pain so maybe you should just be doin' your thing (maybe)
And you things change, well one day it may but not now, not me
What can I say?

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hold up now listen
Hold up (oh) I want you to know how I’m feelin
(I want you)
We had a good thing going why you had to catch feelings?
And this the shit that I don’t know how to deal with
(I don't know how)
Now hold up shawty, why you trippin? I’m just keepin it a thousand

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
And you know what it was from the get go, you know what it was from the get go
Look how it was when we met, look how it was when we met
Man I wasn't trynna kick it like that now
I told you that all fast now
No, you don't wanna hear none of that but I say with all due respect

[Verse 2: Tokyo Jetz]
Yeah, I must be trippin', I know that can’t even be what you sayin'
Ain't ever heard it from no nigga, oh you must be playin'
And you be still [?] callin' like you sweatin me
You ain't the only one, you trynna threatin me? Sheesh
Maybe you busy, just make time for a nigga right
Bitch I ain't Stevie, can't be blind for this nigga right
Don't really matter bout that winin' and that dinin' either
Ain't gotta be a rock, cause bitch you ain't no diamond either
We out in public plus we naked when we fuckin'
And don't tell me that you love me when we touchin'
You wasn't just trynna cut it, kids in future we discussed this
Fuck you mean I ain't the bitch you feelin' and you lovin'?
Wakin' up we layin up to the next morn
[?] on trips, different cities, [?]
Shoulda knew they wasn't lyin you a fuckboy
And you don't do wifey shit for a fuckboy

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Hold up now listen
Hold up (oh) I want you to know how I'm feelin
(I want you)
We had a good thing going why you had to catch feelings?
And this the shit that I don't know how to deal with
(I don't know how)
Now hold up shawty, why you trippin? I'm just keepin it a thousand

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
And you know what it was from the get go, you know what it was from the get go
Look how it was when we met, look how it was when we met
Man I wasn't trynna kick it like that now
