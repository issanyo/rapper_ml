Y'all Know What The Fuck Going On

We back to having fun this time

Whole lot of that Hearts & Crowns gang going around

Live Famous Die A Legend

Marz

Wellssssss !


(Verse)
A lot of talking going on
But they just have some loose
Lips
To everyone like loose chicks
Hoping that I lose it
Everyone from my city rap
But I remain the truest
I like my money blue crip
Go to school you clueless

I invested in myself I had to get my stock up
Since me & ronnie shared a room
Was dreaming on the top bunk
In anything I ever did
I had to be the top one
Just know my bm top notch
If she ever get knocked up

(Hook)
Can’t wait until the summer time to
Pull up in my new whip
Playing all the new hits
They gone be like who’s this

Can’t wait until the summer time to
Pull up in my new whip
Playing all the new hits
They gone be like who’s this

Can’t wait until the summer time to
Pull up in my new whip
Playing all the new hits
They gone be like who’s this

Can’t wait until the summer time to
Pull up in my new whip
Playing all the new hits
They gone be like who’s this

(Verse 2)
I know that you be hatin'
That I count blue faces
I know that you be hatin'
Counting my moves blue in they faces
I been getting high feeling
Like I’m in the matrix
Back then i knew I was everybody’s favorite
But I wasn’t famous it was hard
For them to stay it
Now I got that flavor all the makers
Like tasting
Told em that my time would come
Still they ain’t believe me
Out this world like et
Ballin Michael Beasley
I remember ebt
Grew up watching bet
Videos on mtf
Visioned being who they see

I was down last night
But today’s a new day
Off white Jordan 1s
Bottoms red cool aid
Graduated College
And the street
Got it two ways
Even since high school
Trappin' in them hallways
