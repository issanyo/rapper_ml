Racha

Racha

[Verse 1: Exlord]
Living life like a playboy baller
Trading money for a bunch of hookers
I live the life that can amuse your wife
And make your daughter bear me a daughter
Making dough like casino owners
Realest rapper than a bunch of covers
I'm not golden state but I can steal your thunder
Get drunk even when I'm sober
Cruising my ride and they be feeling the whip
The music is blasting, and they loving the beat
Ladies are yelling, boyfriends are hating
Dj's are spinning, and they know is legit
Quoting my lines will damage your brain
Dealing with groupies, I cannot complain
This is the life I chose to live
Traded my soul for riches and fame
This is that Sriracha
Need some weed, let me show ya
Mix it with the weed, pour a drop
Call that shit, spicy Ganja
Getting high like a climber
Spitting verses like a preacher
Getting girls, off their clothes
Faster than a rapture
They'll be feeling all my game
We be taking shots like Klay
When I need some dome
Chicks kneel like I inspire them to pray[Yeah, Yeah]
Gotta get the hot sriracha some way
Even though I gotta rob a subway
Living large, taking charge
That's how I fucking make my own pay, like

[Hook: Exlord, Over9000]
Spice it up like sriracha
I'm blazing hot like sriracha [Over]
Make you bleed like sriracha [Ex]
Make her squirt like sriracha [Over]
Spice it up like sriracha [Ugh]
I'm blazing hot like sriracha [Ugh]
Make you bleed like sriracha [Ugh]
Make her squirt like sriracha [Frosty Frosty]
Racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha
Racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha
Racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha
Racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha, racha

[Verse 2: Over9000]
This OD, I’m the one son
So hardy I’m bout bump off
Jump off with a Swanton
Bomb then Boom,  just a soon
Like the fuckin’ bridge up in London
Yo OVER, do you want some?
Well that depends on ya buns hun
Uh, cause my anaconda don’t want none
If your bomboms don’t shake like
Cheerleaders do with they pompoms
Sriracha!
Spice it up with sriracha!
I'm coming at ya
With em rocket launchers
But Love & peace
Is the mantra
Once this flows active on the radio
Imma go Cucaracha! [ai ya yai]
Turn into the new Sinatra
Bay-bee!
Maybe!
Say cheese!
When they shooting at ya
Bout to transform
Like a new mecha
Kicks like Lance Storm
I'm the landlord
Of the dance floor
All I ask for
See my womb wrecker
Needs a woodpecker
Bitch you know I spice it up
Like sriracha
Bout to nice it up

Make ur boys bleed
