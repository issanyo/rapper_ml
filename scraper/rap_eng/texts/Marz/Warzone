(Yeah, John Brown.)
(We living strange times man.)
(I don't gotta watch the news.)
(I look out my window and I see a war zone.)
(My whole city a war zone.)

[Verse 1]
Aye, Yeah (YEAH!)
Good morning world, let me get ta couple words
And before you left, start in the dark
Like you one of 5 virtues
We lost our purpose
So I'm a get to church and everything's a mess
What we doing just ain't working'
They acting like the world just in the middle east
With the war up in my streets
In my mind and in my sleep
God, my preacher looking' bleak
That perception's so deep
Now woman thinking they men
And now men thinking they woman
And they love em' just to dance
Money justify the killing
Only love a self steady
Boasting not forgiving
We'd do anything for pleasure
Even sacrifice our children
And we saying love is weak
So we running from our villains
Thieves, liars, frauds, cowards
The enemy evidently got up in us mentally
It's simply elementary
Trade our lives eventually
But that ain't what I made for
So I finna make war

[Hook]
We in a War Zone
Welcome to the War Jo
Them bullets eaten by yo head out in the Ozone
The enemy tricking us to killing the story
But sir, if you focused, don't get focused you gon sing a sad song
(x2)

[Verse 2]
If you ain't here to fight, then what you here fo?
Popping bottles, puffin out, you looking like a WEIRDO
See what I mean jo, is you can't see the real (no)
Unless your mind clear
Eyes are of the near rows
The battlefield up in your mind is what they fussing 'bout
You yelling M-O-B, boy you don know what you're talking 'bout
No one engaged in war fare
Gets themselves tangled up in the affairs of this life, they just die for us
When I was a child, I thought I reasoned like a child
But when I became a man, I put them childish things behind me
Here's the truth
Saying Jesus Christ came to save sinners
I'm a loser, I'm the worst
When you see the truth it hurts, man
But in the last days, even men with fake friends
We're hunting words, bending truth until the day ends
We in the churches
God you pull us from deceptions
I'm not gon sweat it
It's whatever for the mission better

[Hook]
(x2)

[Ending]
A day is quickly approaching
Where the masses will be so dumb now
They will be more interested in fashion choices
Then in their own life choices
A day where children will be havin' children
A day where money will be worth it
And people would gladly sell their soul
For power and fame
A day where love and compassion will be looked at as weakness
A day where cowards will be praised
For degrading our woman
A day when woman will lose all self-respect
And prostitute themselves to the highest bidder
A day where we celebrate frauds
And kill our prophets
That day my dear friends and enemies

Came yesterday...
