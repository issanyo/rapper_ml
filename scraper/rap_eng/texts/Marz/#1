[Verse 1]
I promise that I won't play second fiddle
And no, I won't be caught in the middle, no
Don't worry about me 'cause boy, I'm not gon' miss you
Not even a little baby, no I won't

I'm not gon' deal with a little bit of that
Hell no, not me, baby that's a fact
Not at all
I ain't gon' lie baby, that's so wack
How you gon' try and play me like that?
When you know that I love you
So I hope that she can keep you warm, yeah

[Hook]
If I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two, two, two
Baby, if I'm not the one, then I guess I won't be loving you, you, you
'Cause I gotta be the only one, only one, only one, only one
I gotta be your number one, number one, number one
If I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two, two
And I guess I won't be lovin' you

[Verse 2]
I don't care, I don't share, no, no, not with anyone
Hear me clear, when I say, I'll only be number one
And no, I won't ever, ever settle
No compromise, not even a little
See having another woman laying up in my bed
Isn't the idea of us I had in my head
Since it ain't me and you, then it can't be you and me
Only time will tell, I'll let you see
So I hope that she can keep you warm

[Hook]
If I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two, two, two
Baby, if I'm not the one, then I guess I won't be loving you, you, you
'Cause I gotta be the only one, only one, only one, only one
I gotta be your number one, number one, number one
Baby, if I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two, two
And I guess I won't be lovin' you

[Bridge]
Anything you want, you know I woulda did it
Baby, you believe me
But you still played me like a deck of cards
And now I can't forgive you
Baby, this is so true

[Hook]
If I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two (you can call her), two, two (but it won't be me)
If I'm not the one, then I guess I won't be loving you, you, you
Cause I got to be the only one, the only one, the only one, the only one
Your number one, number one, your number one
If I'm not the one, then I guess you can call number two, two
And I guess I won't be loving you
Won't be loving you
