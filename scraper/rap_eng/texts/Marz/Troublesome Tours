[Chorus: Vic August]
If I lose my bitch then ima get another
Ima run this money up with all my brothers
If you lose me right now you won’t get another
If you lose me right now you won’t get another

Out the vault, bring it out the vault
We stack up a wall, then bring down the wall
Troublesome Tours I’m love with all my (woes)
Troublesome Tours I’m in love with all my (woes)

[Verse 1: MAR$]
Troublesome tours, stay in your lane
(Woah)
Hop out the coupe then I hop in the rafe
(Woah)
Pull up to the set this ain’t no game
(Woah)
Vic in the cut and we coming to aim boy
(Yeah)
I am the one that you heard about
I ain’t the one with the running mouthh
I be the one you be talking bout
But I ain’t the one who be stuntin now
I be the one who be stacking goals up on goals
Turning like a round about
6k on the move and we coming now
6k on the move and we coming now woo
Nigga just stay in your lane
How about just get out my face
I’m making moves like a play
Shoot a jumper nba
I’m in the mode of making bangers, crazy cos you know I’m feeling this way
I ain’t never gonna leave it till I get it cos I be killing this wave
(Woah)
Funny as shit nigga you making me laugh
506 get the money then I dash
Up in the stu, making bangers like it’s rad
(Woah) cos y’all know

[Chorus: Vic August]
If I lose my bitch then ima get another
Ima run this money up with all my brothers
If you lose me right now you won’t get another
If you lose me right now you won’t get another

Out the vault, bring it out the vault
We stack up a wall, then bring down the wall
Troublesome Tours I’m love with all my (woes)
Troublesome Tours I’m in love with all my (woes)

[Verse 2: Seup]
If I count the money you might end up in the plus
Been laze with the veggie
But I'm heavy with the sauce
If you lose the money they won't ever take my cut
They know a nigga cleaner
They already with the dust
Snow day, cold heart I'm surrounded by flakes
Role play, let's pretend you are what you say
Forte, I don't got to sweat just eat
If you ain't talking bout running then you can't move with me
Six times killed a vibe think you need a break
Next time you when you drive you won't see the brakes
They gon’ have to use the town just keeping you safe
Watch you slowly hit the ground when you seen my face
Seupy rolled with a don
Seupy run that joint
Seupy had to leave you smoked
Coz he heard an oink
Watch the smoke in the air when a nigga point
Ballantyne with the bomb
Man you get the point

[Chorus: Vic August]
If I lose my bitch then ima get another
Ima run this money up with all my brothers
If you lose me right now you won’t get another
If you lose me right now you won’t get another

Out the vault, bring it out the vault
We stack up a wall, then bring down the wall
Troublesome Tours I’m love with all my (woes)
Troublesome Tours I’m in love with all my (woes)
