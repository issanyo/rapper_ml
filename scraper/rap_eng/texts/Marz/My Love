[Verse 1]
Save your time
I'll tell you what
(This is my last goodbye)
You and I, we ain't gon' work
(No need to [?])

[Pre-Chorus]
Hol' up give me my phone right now
I don't need your shit right now
Way too long. I've been too down
Far too hard to keep you around
All on me now cause you're feeling the zone
Blowing my high cause you all in my zone
Don't need you. I could do bad on my own
I know you ain't gon' change and that's not what I want
Aha

I see you 'bout to fade out
Tell me how it feels now
I bet that shit feel real now
Uhuh

[Chorus]
This is the last time
You gon' get my time
You tryina act like, like you deserve it but
We both know I'm right
Don't need you in my life
Boy you know I've tried
It wasn't good enough for my
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love. You don't deserve my love
My love, my love, my love. You don't deserve my love
My love, my love, my love. You don't deserve my love
No, no, no!

[Verse 2]
Tears I cried, didn't faze you once
(Well, I ain't crying tonight)
Looked in your eyes. Didn't see no love
(You were colder than ice)
Ain't nothing new, boy
We've been through this before
I finally see you for who you are
Now you won't walk cause I'mma sit at the door
Bet you do better the next time around

[Pre-Chorus]
Hol' up give me my phone right now
I don't need your shit right now
Way too long. I've been too down
Far too hard to keep you around
All on me now cause you're feeling the zone
Blowing my high cause you all in my zone
Don't need you. I could do bad on my own
I know you ain't gon' change and that's not what I want


[Chorus]
This is the last time
You gon' get my time
You tryina act like, like you deserve it but
We both know I'm right
Don't need you in my life
Boy you know I've tried
It wasn't good enough for my
This is the last time
You gon' get my time
You tryina act like, like you deserve it but
We both know I'm right
Don't need you in my life
Boy you know I've tried
It wasn't good enough for my
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love, my love. You don't deserve my love
My love, my love, my love. You don't deserve my love
My love, my love, my love. You don't deserve my love
No, no, no!

[Outro]
You don't deserve my love
No, no, baby
You don't deserve my love
You don't deserve my love
No, no, baby
You don't deserve my love
Ohoh!
