[Chorus]
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah

[Verse 1]
Said she did more than a little molly
Said she's got a man but she don't hold down
She don't wanna be alone tonight, wanted me to get her right
So baby, we can dim the lights and have ourselves a party

[Chorus]
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah

[Verse 2]
There's nothing I could ever say to save you, I'ma bounce it, drive you crazy, speeding into you right now
Drunk fucking, like we're faded, all night and day, yeah, baby, I'ma break your heart
She don't wanna be alone tonight, wanted me to get her right
So baby, we can dim the lights and have ourselves a party

[Chorus]
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Baby, turn that ass around
Four seconds, four seconds
To take it all off, yeah
Oh baby, you got four seconds, four seconds
To turn that ass around, yeah
