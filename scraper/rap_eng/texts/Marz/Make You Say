[Verse 1]
You came to dance, dance
I see you got that look in your eyes
But the man to your left
No he won’t let you out of his sight

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby what you need
I know that this ain't where you wanna be
And I can save you if you come with me
There’s nothing we can’t do, tell me you want to

[Breakdown]
You’ve got something inside
I wanna let out

[Chorus]
So hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh
Hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You, you know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh

[Verse 2]
You’re holding back
But you ain’t gonna last for long
Coz you wanna be back
Can’t have it and it’s turning you on

[Pre-Chorus]
So baby what you need
I know that this ain't where you wanna be
And I can save you if you come with me
There’s nothing we can’t do, tell me you want to

[Breakdown]
You’ve got something inside
I wanna let out

[Chorus]
So hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh
Hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You, you know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh

[Bridge]
Come in close, let me feel you breathe
Make your move to my heartbeat
Have you sing a new melody
I wanna make you scream
Come in close, let me feel you breathe
Make your move to my heartbeat
Have you sing a new melody
I wanna make you scream
You’ve got something inside
I wanna let out

[Chorus]
So hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh
Hold on tight, girl
And we can go all night
You, you know that I can make you say
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh

[Outro]
OoOoOoh, OoOoOoh
