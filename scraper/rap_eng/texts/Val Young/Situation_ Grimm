(Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
All the players in the house better recognize that
Things are looking grimm

Verse1
It was a cold dark night full moon shining bright
Rain showers wind blowin' at 90 miles an hour
I could barely see my shadow
Sparked up a fat ol' Philly
As fat as free Willy really
It's kind of chilly in my brain
Rappers get nightmares like Dana Dane man
This type scares optometrist
Plain and simple it's all mind and wrist
On a tempt Oh my goodness could this
Be the format where I'm at
In the abyss underground other sound
Top ten list-erine just to keep my vocals cleanest
Meanest you ever seen this incredible like the Hulk
I stay awoke alphabetical twista mista
With a rap book guaranteed to leave a
Gloomy outlook

Chorus (Val Young)
All the hustlers in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm
All the players in the house better recognize
That things are looking grimm

Verse2
Oh boy watch me throw the bomb like Troy Aikman
And knock out eight men
Goddamn shit it's miraculous
This mysterious immaculate
History makin' rap sheet on a beat
Leavin' niggas shakin' from follicle to feet
With funkanisms shining like a prism SPINK
Sparkling remarkably glowing as I think thought thunk
Conceived off the skunk but funk
Best believe that it stunk
Not your ordinary fragrance
Wash cleanse your mind with Grimm
Squash wash watch out now
Here's me hear me Smack
Check your eardrum
Is it intact in fact?
[Coughing] when?
Approximately when the situation's grimm

Chorus

Verse3
Normally I formally introduce afflawed
Not true and technique and stick to it
Magnifique unique eek what have we
Mathematics for attics that equal cavi
And then some then some MC's make 'em crumble
When I mumble cause I'm fly like a bumble
C-O-V-I-N-A on the western area
Niggas are sick like malaria
Never smoke rock cause it's deadly
I just stick to Indo smoke and the medleys
Steadily developing on the constant
Causing a heat wave like Linda Rhimestead
Can't we look at how I hook it and present
Proof how the mind was took and shook in past tense
For ladies and gents here's the invitation
[Things are looking grimm] (over last line)
One way ticket to a grimm situation

Chorus with ad libs until fade out
