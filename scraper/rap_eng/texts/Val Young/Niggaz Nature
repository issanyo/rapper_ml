[Intro: 2Pac & Val Young]
One, two
To a nigga nature, haha..
(Oohhh)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin' surprised? You saw the bullshit comin'
Fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda thought about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom PÃ©rignon
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you be smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that "buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?

[Hook: Val Young]
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastards drop
Label me Makaveli, thug nigga with pipe
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

[Hook: Val Young & 2Pac]
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
(That's a nigga nature)
Why cry, when he do you that way

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin' bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature

[Hook: Val Young & 2Pac]
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's nature
(Cause that's a nigga nature)
Why cry, when he do you that way
(This be a nigga's nature)
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's nature
(It ain't my fault, that's a nigga nature)
Why cry, when he do you that way
(Don't blame me, blame my mama, a nigga nature)
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way
Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way
