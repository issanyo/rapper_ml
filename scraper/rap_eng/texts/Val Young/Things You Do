[Verse 1]
Struck me like a lightning, baby
I had to break down to be around
'Cause you're that special lady
Girl, you know how I feel about you
You can make time stand still
Unless we are together
Every time the lights turn out
I want you with me, gimme everything you got

[Chorus]
It's the things you do, the things you say
It turns me on, baby, makes me feel this way
It's the things you do, the things you say
It turns me on, baby, makes me feel this way


[Verse 2]
Honey, you're the sweetest candy
You got me fienin' to taste that
You know how to make me happy
Just keep on givin' me love, your sweet love
Night after night I found myself dreamin'
Oh, about you! Day after day I know
What I'm missing, you know the deal

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Swing up on me, baby
Sat down when I saw your face
Can yah flick it on me?
Invited me to your place
And you dropped the bomb
When you slipped on that lingerie
Yeah, yah got me, and I'm speechless
And the only thing that I can say
Is oooh eeeh

[Chorus]
