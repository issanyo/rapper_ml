[Intro: DJ EZ Dicc]
This is DJ EZ Dicc, and this is the Golden Shower Hour
Early in the morning
Wake your goat mouth ass up
This is 187.4 FM on your dial
And we flippin' it just like this
For all you motherfuckin' real G's out there, huh
Come with the real shit, 187.4 FM on your dial

[Verse 1: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Uh, to the tick-tock, ya don't stop
Uh, to the beep-beep and you don't freak
Uh check It out baby bubba in the place to be
My name is Snoop (say what?)
The one they wanna see, so um...
Blaze up the bud and break out the champagne
'Cause we rollin' in the fast lane trying to find the right lane
Doing it, just like players
Laying down laws, Governors, mayors
Pay us, to stay up on top of things
There's something ‘bout being in that Dogg Pound Gang
That makes me wanna have some type of hustle in life
If being wrong is broke, I can’t be right
Despite all the madness you hear nowadays
Stealin’ rhymes from super duper scenes to get you paid
But you played yourself, 'cause you can’t play me
I see through you but you can’t see me

[Chorus: Val Young & (Snoop)]
He's been watching you (he'll be watching) so smooth
Long Beach is on the move
(Smooth, like the motion of water)
He's been watching you (he'll be watching you) so smooth (so smooth)
Long Beach is on the move

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Now I’m a bona fide microphone technician with styles
I came to storm on these MC's like electrical clouds
Hear me now, a born killer like Mick n' Mall'
Down to trip and empty clips and permanently exile
The oppositions, competition, discrete and dismantled
Light ‘em up like candlesticks with the instinct of a vandal
Vandalize, how I reprimand MC's to freeze
Moving guarantees the temperature decrease degrees
Frozen stiff, 'cause what I’m holdin’ lifts the soul
This metal automatic weapon keeps me in control
Never fold, I scald like water in order
To let these MC's know I slaughter, so time's getting shorter
It sorta limit ya, but to me the sky’s the limit
Ya know I diminish ya, to dust, Tec's sinister
Bust one rhyme that’s like a voodoo hex
Connect complex styles, my vast high tech flex
'Cause when there’s, an MC like me who’s in there like swimwear
Don’t despite me, 'cause all the hoes like me, mashin’ in Nikes
I done seen niggas on TV, dissin’ to get deals
Now I got one question, nigga: how does it feel?
Check your game, but I ain't even sayin’ no names
Proclaimed lyricist dissin’ us for fortune and fame
Did I do somethin’ to you? Did we serve ya hoes?
'Cause your on TV rappin’ like ya knew me and know me
But you don’t really know me, that motherfuckin' nigga from the D.P.G
The K-U-R-U-P-T, I’m too smooth (motherfucker)

[Chorus: Val Young]
He's been watching you (he'll be watching) so smooth (you)
Dogg Pound Is on the move (is on the move)
He's been watching you (he'll be Watching) so smooth (you)
Dogg Pound is on the move (is on the move)

[Scratched Sample]
Everybody's got to hear the shit...

[Outro: DJ EZ Dicc]
I know that's right
Real smooth here on 187.4 FM on your dial
The station that's playing platinum hits, baby, that's keeping you coming
And I'm the DJ with the fattest sack, DJ E...Z
Look between my legs and you'll know why
On that station that's sockin' some soul to your ass
W-Ballz fadin' 'em all
And now we're gonna take some calls:

[Caller 1]
I wanna dedicate this one to my girl Cheryl
Out there, man, with a fat ass bitch

[Caller 2]
Yo, this is Barry White
Yo, Tha Dogg Pound, y'all muthafuckas sounding good, sho you right
Keep doing what you're doing, you players

[Caller 3: Kevin "Slo Jammin'" James]
I'm Kevin "Slo Jammin'" James from 92.3 The Beat
Man, this shit is so smooth
I'm switching up, get me an application
I wanna work for W Ballz
