[Verse 1]
Find what I was searching for, you're the perfect package
But you make mine and more
It's been hard to make
Hanging out with all these other girls
But it ain't my thing
I'm gonna keep it real, girl I know that you'll be on with me

[Chorus]
Hey lover, love the way you're workin'
Chemistry is perfect
Let's talk here over babe
So you can tell me what you like
Hey lover, lover
Fulfilling one another
Let's go on undercover
And break each other off, a little bit of love tonight

[Verse 2]
Wondering what you're thinking 'bout
But I ain't worried
Knowing that I'm gonna make you mine
But I'm not in a hurry
Honey just relax and vie, enjoy the lovely bed
Before the night is over
I'm gonna hear you say

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge]
Open your eyes, know we look sexy in each other arms?
Can you feel me babe?
When we together, ain't no pressure
When you and me
Ain't nothing
I want you, hey, lover
Don't think I'm crazy
Ain't nothing shame, I'm o this ground to make you my lady
Ain't nobody better, can't nobody do it
Can't nobody treat me like you do
Ain't nobody better, can't nobody do it
Can't nobody treat me like you do

[Chorus] x2
