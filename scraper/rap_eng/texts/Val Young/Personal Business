[Intro]
Handle yours
Ey... life is a Personal Business
This here what I'm handlin', it's Personal Business
You handle your Business
Before I handle you, you heard me?
Val holla at 'em

[Hook: Val Young]
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't never let the game catch you slippin'
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you, it'll drive you insane

[Bad Azz]
This here life of mine down this one way street, it's so unpredictable
Tryin' to run into a dollar, drama all I seem to get into
Can't rewind time, so the problems that's mine -
It's either solve 'em, or deal with 'em tomorrow
Can't borrow, ain't got a job, money ain't circulatin'
Cops hot, spot dropped, so it ain't no work in yay (what's up?)
What's up? I'm thinkin' "Damn, I need a dollar"
I feel stuck and the hard times make me wanna holla
God help me out here, oh no, I'm with my last
Knowin' I can be the next to die, gone with the pass that
I don't wanna feel like real life's hard and live fake
Cause when they do me, ay, this ain't no movie, ain't no "take two"
You ever think about where your life gon' take you?
Ain't you - grateful to be alive?
Oh, you wanna die cause life hates you?
Don't let it take you, or make you, or break you

[Hook: Val Young]
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't never let the game catch you slippin'
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you, it'll drive you insane

[Bad Azz]
Oh yeah, the game'll get ya, hit ya hard and make ya fall
And leave ya broke with no hope and, no get back
Let's try hard to see success and not to stress and get there
You stay persistent long enough, you probably have shit where?
Everything you need'll be exactly where it need to be
To me the streets and peace are never seen in gleamin'
We - seemingly forgot about the kids doin' what we did
Caught up gettin' high, watchin' time go by
Now they wanna smoke and drink and ride on by
Catch a case, be at their place, and it's a long cold ride
Judge just gave Shorty Mack 1-0-5
And I doubt that he'll live to be a hundred and thirty-three
They try to tell him that he gon' die off in the penitentiary
He mentioned he - needed me to send him a package
I'mma shoot it to ya, man I know the game'll do it to ya
Yes it will like that (like that)

[Hook: Val Young]
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't never let the game catch you slippin'
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you, it'll drive you insane

[Bad Azz]
For me, it's been a long time comin' with a stretch up ahead
And I ain't scared but I don't wanna be dead
I caught the game tryin' to kill me and found out it's been several attempts
It hurts to know this shit gettin' so personal
It's worse as though you know you can't do nothin' about it
Least you know the world will never be crowded (ha ha ha ha)
The same thang that make you laugh'll make you cry
The same game that got you rich will make you die
Fuck the truth, we like livin' in a lie
It ain't no time to try to find my lost mind
I'm on the grind, I got rent, I need nickels and dimes
Would I be sent, and life is a personal business
Sell your service, not your soul if you ain't got no doe
Nah, I ain't tellin' you to go and try to sell your brain
If you ain't got you a scale and a barrel of 'caine
I'm just sayin', got to use what you got to get what you want
And most folks don't, I gotta handle mine
You better -

[Hook: Val Young]
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't never let the game catch you slippin'
Take care of your Personal Business
Don't let the game get you, it'll drive you insane
