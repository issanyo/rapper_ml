[Napoleon talking]
Yeah, we gone dedicate this one, to the memory
Of Makaveli the Don, 2Pac
You know, we got these cats, re-makin' the songs
And nobody wanna give you a song, it's from the lil' homie
Strength of the strong

[Verse 1: Napoleon]
I don't know where to start, dear God can you open my heart
Let me share with this world my art, this not no R.I.P song
It's a tribute to the spirit of Pac, I still remember when you visit my block
I was a juvenile, in 94' I was stuck in the war
Didn't know the meaning of life or what I was breathin' for
You gave me a hand; you gave me your plan
Thug Life worldwide with expand
That was your dreams homie
Now it's present right in front of your eyes
They can't tell me your soul ain't alive
'Cause I can feel it homie
Dear lord please forgive these sins we all lost souls stuck in the wind
So let us in, 'cause we cryin' at the gates of heaven
I've been tryin' since the age of seven
Only God knows, we gone make it I bet'cha homie
If it wasn't for Kadafi, I wouldn't have met'cha homie
Try to—open your heart and feel me a minute
If it wasn't for you, I would've been dead or in prison
So I dedicate this song to you
My whole success truly belongs to you
And that's true

[Hook: Val Young & Johnny J]
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will

[Verse 2: Napoleon]
Me and Johnny in the studio, reminiscin' over you
Try'na put these hits down, thinkin' what would you do
In 2002 and 2003, the worlds going crazy, industry is lazy
It ain't comin' with it, like you came wit' it
You pass me the torch, so now I ran wit' it
I'm still a outlaw, but I'm doing it dolo
We all go our separate ways, homie you know
But I die for this thug-life
It ain't no thing I ride for this Thug Life
Know what I mean? And I humble myself
I ain't wild no more, but I don't leave the door without my foe-foe
Homie guess who I ran to, Val Young "To Live And Die In L.A"
She still singin' like she sung it when you was around
Homie sometimes I wish that you was around
Still puttin' it down
Come on

[Hook: Val Young & Johnny J]
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will

[Verse 3: Napoleon]
I still remember what you told me
Keep My Head Up, Are You Still Down
Don't never give up, do I Get Around
No I had to switch up
I did a lot of changes dawg I had to grow up
It's still All Eyez On Me
Oh yeah remember Shorty well he Still Wanna Be A Thug
Reminds me of meand I Ain't Mad At'cha
That you had to go
Oh yeah that Rose From The Concrete it did grow, and Brenda— she had another baby
She wonder why they call her a trick, Pac it's crazy
Once in a while we had gangsta parties
I still Toss It Up, but I don't drink Bacardi
The realest hit you ever wrote everybody's—
Favorite song I mean it played at every party
When Makaveli came to pop the party
Was the hardest music that you could find on the market
Yeah, ya legacy gone live through me
Every breath that I take, you gone breath through me
June 16th '71 was the day we got a present from heaven
Pac's spirit stays present
And that's real

[Hook: Val Young & Johnny J]
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will
I never forget what you said
Never forget what you did
I never will
I never will
I will never will

[Collision: Johnny J]
Yo Pac, this is to you man
You know that Johnny-J got love for you
I kept it going for you man
The legacy lives on
Its nothin' but love for you
Just remember one thing Pac
I'ma keep this ride the way you wanted me to ride
I'ma let them know, it never ends
I'll never forget you man
