Running away
Running away, love
Running away
Running away, love
Running away
Running away, love
Running away
Running away, love

Girl, it's so amazing
But it happens to me every time
That I look into your eyes
And I really wish that you were mine
Well, well, well

Girl, can’t understand it
That I never can get you alone
And everytime that I call you up
You never once picked up the phone

Tell me why
(don't you stop, don't you stop, don’t you stop)

Why you wanna keep on
Running away
Tell me why, girl
Running away, love

Why you wanna keep on
Running away
Tell me whyyy
Running away, love

Girl, don't be a stranger
You know you can't keep your love from me
I will getcha like I did before
And take you where I think you're up to be
Well, well, well

Girl, I know you hear me
So pay attention to the words I say
You can hide if you want to, baby
But you know you can't run away

Tell me why
(don't you stop, don't you stop, don't you stop)

Why you wanna keep on
Running away
Tell me why, girl
Running away, love

Why you wanna keep on
Running away
Tell me whyyy
Running away, love

Why you wanna keep on
Running, baby
Tell me why
Tell me why

[Val Young]
Tell you what I’m running from

[Val Young]
It's that thang, that makes you wanna do it
It's that thang, that makes you wanna do it

[Rick James]
It's that thang, that makes you wanna do it (x8)

[Val Young & Rick James]
It’s that thang, that makes you wanna do it (x8)
