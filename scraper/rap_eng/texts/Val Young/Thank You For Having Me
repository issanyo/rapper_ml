[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
If I never told you this let me say this to you properly
Momma you my everything, you taught me how to be this way
Devil is a liar so I'ma walk the Jesus way
You taught me how to lead so I'ma take the stand and lead today
I thank you for everything you've given me
More precious than jewelry and you could read it in my eulogy
Every day you pray for me and keep them demons away from me
I love you dearly, sincerely [?]
Love Snoop

[Chorus]
Momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up instead you raised a family
I wanna thank you momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up but you did it like a G
Momma, thank you for having me
Could've gave me up but you raised a family
I wanna thank you momma, thank you for having me (Mother)
Could've gave me up (Mother) but you did it like a G (Momma)

[Verse 2]
What can I say? What can I do?
I'll sit back and admire you
Oh what a beauty you are to me
(Woah momma)
This song to you I dedicate
The sacrifices that you made
And today's your special day, oh
Surrounded by your family and your friends
We want you to know you're a special lady
You are appreciated, oh (Momma)
You were always there for me (Momma)

[Chorus]
Momma, thank you for having me

[Verse 3]
How bout a musical for the beautiful
We should do something out the usual
Go pack a bag and we could hit the road momma

Woah momma
All of my life you was the back up bone
You taught me life [?] blacker tones
And you know poppa was a rolling stone
(M-O-T-H-E-R)
I wanna wish you happy mother's day
I hate to fight [?]
Taught me there ain't nothing like the family

We wouldn't even have no birthdays
If you ain't love us in the first place
