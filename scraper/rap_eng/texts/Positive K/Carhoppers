Speak on it now
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers

Uhh, uhh!  I call girls carhoppers
Cause I make em hit notes like they was singin at the operas
May I say, on anyday, yeah they with it
They're in a Yugo, if you got the Yugo kitted (say what?)
Stand by your man, yes that's what they all claim
You don't have a car?  Then you're fucked up in the game
They'll walk by ya, and say hiya
Is he drivin cause he cute?Â  Oh no, his shit
Is tired (oh no)
And they'll turn like you got the virus
Cause you didn't have a car, or the one had there wasn't flyest
But for the record I'm not trickin
But you can call me Timex, cause I'll still take the lickin
So if you're hot and bothered, or in a frenzy
I'll pop _The Mack_ soundtrack in the Benzy
And you can tell me how you choose me baby
Baby, this no time for you, to act crazy
You can't play me, not like Play-Doh
Don't leave me for the kid honey, in the Laredo (speak on it)
But if you gots to go, you gotta go, I can't stop her
That's the lifestyles of the carhoppers

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (uhh!)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (uhh!)
Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (yeah)

Mmm, uhh!  A yeah baby, things is kinda swivey
Ever since my dad put me up on his Rivi-era
Now I see things much clearer
When I'm in my ride, women wanna be nearer to the
Showstopper, yeah the profiteerer
Uhh, excuse me honey, it's not nice to stare
Dare, if you wanna get with this here
Put on your best gear, and step to the rear
I'll be there, say about 10:30
And know that don't be late honey cause my beeper, is loaded
And, if you're not there, by the toot of the horn
*BEEP* (kick it) Uhh, I'm gone.. carhoppers!

Carhoppers, car-car-hoppers (heyyy)

Uhh, now you think things is right; cause she's on
The next man's gooseneck and suckin his exhaust pipe
She's got him and he's got an erection
Just because of his fuel injection, system
All before yeah she used to diss him
Now she knows money on down to his pistons
And his engine, or let's say his chassis
Just blow your horn and she'd run like Lassie
Or better yet, she'd flip like Kujo
If you got a Jag, or a Porsche Turbo (once again, break it down)
They got more promises than Thomases
And I think they better go and call, Hoppers Anonymous
But I know, where to send em
Ah to the Hyundai dealer to gets the Benz emblem
