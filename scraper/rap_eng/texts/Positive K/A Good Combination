Ayio L, have you seen that girl lately
You know the one that we freak kinda crazy
We had 'em all, lay through 80
But this one, she was acting kind of crazy

[Hook]
Saying baby, I got you baby
She said baby, I got you heh

[Verse 1]
Now I don't mean to be or eff you to the fire
But never said I did, then I'd probably be a liar
It's been seven years and I still haven't retired
If I retire who would kids have to admire
Now don't front, just say that it's true
I'm like the [?] exciting and new
And now we're going to do, like we did in 82
To the Latin Quarter crew, you know how we do
We go, shamalama king the body slammer
Watch Pos K just grab you with the grammar
I hit your girl harder than a hammer
You say posi, why you slam her
Cause she's a bad mamajama
I'm from the land down under
Ride that butt like a Honda
Work it out, like my name is J Fonda (yeah)
You can't stop me, trip me nor trap me
I can stay around and can make Mad Cobra happy
So when you count it down you finna got to find a sound
You just grow wings out here in China town
So catch a flashback, sing a serenade
Ladies shop my name for the next decade
For the fall of Five pro I go toe to toe
I'm pushing my rhyme like a pimp push a hoe (yo)
I'm the thriller and manilla top biller
Who's chiller if rappers where Cops
Then I would probably be the Cop-killer
Not the Pop-singer, but the Mop-ringer
You get hit with quick
You got a girl than better not bring her
To my dick son, do you dig son
Like Fred Sanford said, "this is the big one"
You see you want it, I'm with it
I done it, I did it
And you can ask a [?] admit it
I gots to get it
I'm so excited, most rappers can't stand it
I'm like Captain Kirk I got a blue bitch on another planet
So won't buy me son, don't you dare try me son
When I rock Kids be like "Ohh mami can you go buy me one"
Don't break a flam, you know who I am
I'm the K, not some ordenary everyday type of an MC
So go quote me in your say
Now that'll happen, when he's rapping, when he's rapping
And Latin Ricky will call up like "Lucy what happened"
See I don't play that, I'm Pos the K
After me you won't even wipe your ass
To say, I got clout that you never doubt
And in a battle, somebody get knocked the fuck out (boy)
On the square dare I swear
I make love so good, I'll fuck the perm out your hair

[Hook]
Baby, I got you baby
I said baby, I got you
