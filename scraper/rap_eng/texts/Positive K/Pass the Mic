[Intro]
Uh, uh!
Yeah, yeah!
Uh, uh!
(Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!)
Yeah, yeah!
(Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!)
Uh, uh!
(Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!)
Yeah, yeah!
(Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!)
Uh, uh!
(Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!)

[Verse 1]
I give [?] to ladies who say that they need it
All you braggin' about perpetratin' pimp-hoes beat it
It's not my fault that I'm the man you wanna mimic
A gentleman [?] rapper, back off me, that's my gimmick
You're not dapper, your suit's not from the tailor
You bought it off the rack because you're wack and plus a failure
Grab my mic, no nah you can't reach it
A-be like me, you couldn't learn it if I teach ya
Now I don't know some rappers from Adam (yeah)
I won't brag and try to say that I can wreck 'em (yeah)
See I hold my own and protect my perimeter
I won't limit him or even limit her
I do what I do and that's for me
Nevertheless it sounds selfish but that's the key
And I don't hang with those people who likes to half step
'Cause that will result in me havin' a bad rep
And I don't need no bad publicity
Walkin' around havin' no names dissin' me
Sayin' I get taxes if I'm a salary
Knowing my songs [?] as if it was a calorie
'Cause I'm that man that ladies be glad to see
When it comes to women I specialize in the anatomy
Now talk about me like a Hollywood scandal
Uh! 'Cause I'm sure hard to handle, uh!

[Hook]
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Yeah, yeah!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, uh!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Yeah, yeah!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, uh!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Yeah, yeah!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, uh!)

[Verse 2]
Now life's a game and I live it accordingly
Brothers are jel' 'cause women are supporting me
They bought an album and plus the show ticket
They wanna see the original rapper who's praised by the critics
Not fall short because I don't fall short of
Every women's thought that means I'm always thought of
Take 'em slim and fat with a name like Jane Doe
Even take your hoe and put a tag on your toe
I'm giving women life for all those who wanna get it (and)
So cut your man baby, call the paramedics (what else)
Life's too short to be carryin' around dead weight
Make that move right now before it's too late
I'm hard to handle that means you can't grip me
I can't be whipped, baby don't try to whip me
I can't be blown, thrown or shown
I said the only thing Positive can be is known
Worldwide and even locally
Yeah, all instrumental and ya'know vocally
I got the voice that makes the almighty dollar
Get a ring around your [?] around your collar
When you mess with [?] Cinderella
If you see her tell her Positive's a smooth fella

[Hook]
Uh, yeah!
Uh, yeah!
Uh, yeah!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, yeah!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, yeah!)
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge! (Uh, yeah!)
I'm the best thing that came since grits!

[Verse 3]
Now back up off and stop jackin' off
And all my battles won were strictly by forfeit
Some saw the beginning but none saw the ending
With the thought of winning but the title's still pending (damn)
Then me, the holder, strictly 'cause I took ya
Said that you're raw, but nah I think I cooked ya
You're done, well done, matter-fact crispy
Now you hung around sayin' "Pos, why you diss me?!"
I'm not mediocre, the Batman or the Joker
Life is a game similar to poker
But I'm a flush, yes a flush that's royal
My girl is always loyal unlike they Olive Oil
Steppin' in the boots, I think I'll smack him to a finish
Popeye's a punk for relyin' on some spinach
I get fed up, I go head up
[?] I'm shoppin' I might pull the lead off (hmmm)
'Cause I'm a sinner with an itchy trigger finger
A bone so hot I got to turn off your ringer (c'mon)
I took all I could stand, can't stand no more (what else)
My house is decorated in a modern decor
My clothes have a Positive K signature
And I'm sure next year I'ma headline the tour
Like that y'all (that y'all), Positive K (Mmm)
Yes in the night and also the day
I say that I've done because I did it
I'ma end the song by tellin' Silver D to hit, c'mon

[Outro]
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
Pass me the mic 'cause I'm off the ledge!
