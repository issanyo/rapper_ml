[Verse One]
Now this one is for you liars and you jokers
You blabbermouths and you damn crack smokers
Someone's talking about my wrong subjects
And it's time for Positive K to flex
My muscle, and then for me to stick out my chest
[You gonna mop shop, pop?] Oh yes
But I'm mad, somebody said that I couldn't rap
[Hold up} Heh, who told 'em that?
Because I'm qualified
Plus you know I'm phallic
And all my fans casted their ballots
They voted me the number one solo sensation
A rapper and a fighter with a [Good combination]I got the baddest left jab that you ever saw
You want to riff? Then let me tap you on your jaw
So I suggest that if you've got a beef with me
To keep that thought in total secrecy
'Cause I don't care about you jockey busters anyhow
I just came here to say
It's all over now

[Hook]

{Over}
It's all over now
{Over now}

[Verse Two]
See, when I was young I used to watch Wonderama
Looked up to my dad, real close to my mama
Since then I was taught there's no future in frontin'
Being timid and shy would never ever get me nothin'
I transformed into a real go-getter
Prepared for the worst, but always hoped for the better
I'm not a success but I'll say I'm a successor
A real cool guy and a casual dresser
I'm dipped
Occasionally, I gots to flip up on a sister or mister
Who feels that they're equipped to deal
With me on my rapping field
See, I'm the best, so the rest must kneel
To Positive: the gentle-man, the rapper
Intelligent, clean-cut, and so effin' dapper
I gets the benefits, in other words the fringes
I rocks the house and the doors off their hinges
You get astounded, even dumbfounded
Smacked so fucking hard you'd think your ass was surrounded
I'll upset ya, wet ya, engage ya
Do it just like Ali did it to Frasier
So if you feel it's real, play me on the wrong note
And fuck around, huh, and get your jaw broke
It's over now

[Hook]

{Over}
It's all over now
{Over now}

[Verse Three]
I gets the red out, rappers is dead out
I'll put your head out and you better gets the hell out
'Cause I run 'em I ran 'em
I really couldn't stand 'em
I did 'em, I done 'em
And now all I can do for you is son 'em
'Cause I'm the badder dada
I kicks the data
You get mixed in the badder battlin'
It doesn't matter
So now, what's the scenario?
Where they go? Here we go
Give me your name and your number
Whiles me do you very slow
Who's my victim?
Watch me vic 'em and dick 'em
And I'll BRRDDDT stick 'em
Let my hooker trick 'em
'Cause yo I got the jism
I race in the race in the prism
Fly to your bladder
Just like a platter when I didn't miss 'em
Keep it together, I'm sharper than cheddar
Better than a machete, ready
Truncate it to the letter
I'm the enforcer, can't refuse my offer
Or you'll be over the bridge
Shit, who's the bosser
Cleaning your shit up because you was a quitter
Unlike the Pos K
They say I'm a home run hitter
Stripped, whipped, flipped of your title
Good golly Miss Molly, Little Richie needs your idol
But no, I'll be your tutor tutor
'Cause you're kind of new to
Me the pursuder of the man Buddha
You don't know my style and you're sorry
Kinda fiery, yours is tirey
Now go write that in your diary
'Cause I'mma can 'em, I ban 'em
I fix your papers on my annum
When I come natives start bangin' like a bantam
I gots the fluid, get to it, pursue it
You see I hit Nia Peeples but don't you tell Howard Hewitt
Because it's over now

[Hook x4]

{Over}
It's all over now
{Over now}
