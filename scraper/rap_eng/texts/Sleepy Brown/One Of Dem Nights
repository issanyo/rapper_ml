[Chorus:]
Everybody's ready, time to get it
'Cause it's 'bout to be ('bout to be) One of dem nights
Hope you keep it steady, time to get it
'Cause it's 'bout to be ('bout to be) One of dem nights
(It's about to be) one of dem nights (one of dem nights)
One of dem nights ('bout to be) One of dem nights
(It's about to be) one of dem nights, one of dem nights
(You will see) One of dem nights

[Verse 1:]
It's time to get it on, we got it laid out for you
Whatever turns you on (on)
Don't stop from dusk 'til dawn, even then we'll keep partyin'
And vibin' to this song

[Bridge:]
Whatever your groove, we got it (alright)
Ain't nobody leavin' 'cause it's time to get on board
We're gonna groove, 'til morning
If you got to leave then you just might as well go home
'Cause it's one of dem nights

[Chorus 2:]
Everybody's ready, time to get it
'Cause it's 'bout to be (it's 'bout to be) One of dem nights
Hope you keep it steady, time to get it
'Cause it's 'bout to be, One of dem nights (it's about to be)
One of dem nights, one of dem nights ('bout to be)
One of dem nights (it's about to be)
One of dem nights (one of dem nights), one of dem nights (you will see)
One of dem nights

[Verse 2:]
Can't you tell by the moon, that it's a special evenin'?
We're about to leave real soon (soon)
These here say shubble acts, that you're about to witness
Girl ain't no turnin' back

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2]

[music, Bridge 2:]
One of dem nights, one of dem nights
One of dem nights
One of dem nights, one of dem nights
One of dem nights

[music to end]
