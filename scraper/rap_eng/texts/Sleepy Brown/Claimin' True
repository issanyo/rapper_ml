[Intro dialogue]

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well it is I, the pimp player nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and playa rhymes that I fuck with
And bury amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit
I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000]
Our heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me?
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap or dap from niggas slinging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about Barack, strap myself and keep on danking
'Cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I paid my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Break]

[Chorus: Big Boi]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Rico Wade]
What y'all fuck niggas know about that?
OutKast, Goodie Mob, P.A
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me

[Kawan "K-Axe" Prather]
Yeah, it's K-Axe, here to let y'all know
Ain't shit changed, just a couple of more names
Yeah, that's right
Organized Noize, JOI, Big Gipp, Big Rube
CeeLo, Goodie Mob, P.A., and the muthafuckin' OutKast
That's right, nigga, we taking that bullshit no mo' in '94
Shit

[Outro: Big Boi & (Rico Wade)]
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
(Peace to the Godfather ass, gangsta ass niggas, Antonio Reid)
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
