[Intro]
It's showtime
Tryna make the money fall in line, yeah
Time to stack, hit the track
Time to make all our moves

[Chorus]
Say, if you want it, just please understand
Say, if you want it, just come be the man
Say, if you want it, it's all in your hands
Say, if you want it, the devil will dance
That's if you want it

[Interlude]
See, baby, it's a lifestyle
You got to be born in this thing
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm talkin' about cars and jewelry
Women everywhere, baby
This ain't nothin' for lames, y'all
You got to know what you're doing
And know how you move
Let's get back on it, baby

[Verse]
Everybody wants to be the man
But they don't understand
That comes with consequences, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no guarantee, but you better believe
That shit don't last forever
So you gotta be careful

[Chorus]
Say, if you want it, just please understand
Say, if you want it, just come be the man
Say, if you want it, it's all in your hands
Say, if you want it, the devil will dance
That's if you want it

[Bridge]
All your wildest dreams can come true, yeah
Keep your third eye open and play by the rules
'Cause it's yours, you got it
You got it, it's the score
It's all yours, you got it
You got it, this is yours

[Outro]
Believe me, it ain't easy, no
Watch your back, pay your dues
Respect the streets and keep it cool
Cool, cool
Say, if you want it, just please understand
Say, if you want it, just come be the man
Say, if you want it, it's all in your hands
Say, if you want it, the devil will dance
That's if you want it
