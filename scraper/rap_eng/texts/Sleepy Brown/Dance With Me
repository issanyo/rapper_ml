[Chorus:]
Come dance with me... come dance
Come dance with me... come dance
Come dance with me... it's yo' chance
Come and dance with me... come dance
Come dance with me

[Verse 1:]
I see you lookin' so sexy
Ah, baby why don't ya let me?
Get a little bit closer girl
I, I got somethin' to show ya

[Bridge:]
And, ooh, I like to hit the floor
And move (and move) with you (with you)
And, ooh, I think there's so much more
That I (that I) can do (can do) but for now just

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Now ya know that I like it
Girl, got me so excited
Our bodies are so close on the dance floor
That I can't deny it

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge 2:]
Come dance with me (come on baby) come dance with me (dance with me lady)
Come dance with me (dance with me) come dance with me (dance with me)
Come dance with me (come on laby) come dance with me (dance with me bady)
Come dance with me (dance with me) come dance with me (dance with me)

[Chorus x2]
[music to fade]
