(feat. Joi)

It's time to get freaked... oh it's time to get freaked...
It's time to get freaked... oh it's time to get freaked...

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down with me (whoooaaa)
Oh ho hum, your body feels so good I wish that
We, could stay like this forever
Oh ho hum, fingertips move across you so slowly (whoooaaa)
Oh ho hum, the freakiness inside me wish that
We, can stay like this forever

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Joi][with ad-libs]
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Oohoohooh... ooh ooh ooooohoooh... hmmm

[Verse 2: Joi]
Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down on me (whoooaaa)
Oh ho hum, My body feels so good I wish that
We, could stay like this forever
Oh ho hum, fingertips move across me so slowly (whoooaaa)
Oh ho hum, the freakiness inside me wishes
We, could stay like this forever

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown & Joi][with ad-libs]
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Mmmhmmhmm... whoooaaa
Oohoohooh... ooh ooh ooooohoooh... hmmm

[Bridge: Joi]
Oh ho hum... oh ho hum
Oh ho hum...
Oohoohooh... ooh ooh ooooohoooh... hmmm

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown & Joi]
Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down with me
Oh ho hum, your body feels so good I wish that
We, could stay like this forever

[Outro: Sleepy Brown & Joi]
Oh ho hum...
