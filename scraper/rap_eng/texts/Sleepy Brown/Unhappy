[Intro: Unnamed Man + Big Boi]
Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!
Lucious! Sir Lucious!
Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered

[Hook]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 1 - Big Boi]
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

[Hook]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 2]
Once upon a rhyme one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce!

[Hook]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Verse 3]
1979, Dirty South, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the game plan 'cause we got that hot sauce

[Hook]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
