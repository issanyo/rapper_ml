[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

[Verse 1]
Sometimes when it's late at, when it's late at night
And you have no one to talk to
Here's what you do
You go through that raggedy cell phone 'bout two or three times
Tracy ain't home, Tina ain't home
The Love Below starts talkin' to ya

[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher

[Verse 2]
The circumcision has already begun
Desensitizing the very thing or thang
That brought you into this motherfucker in the first place
And when I say "motherfucker", I do mean "motherfucker"
Because Mother Earth is dying
And we continue to fuck her to death
Play with your own score sheet
Become the master of your own 'bation
And yes, God is watching you
But no need to be embarrassed
For the future is in your hands
No, the future is in your hand
Play with your own score sheet

[Chorus]
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
Every boy and girl, woman to man
When you feel you've done about the best you can
Motherfuck the wagon, come join the band
Vibrate, vibrate higher
