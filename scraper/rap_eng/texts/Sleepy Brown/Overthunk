[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
I can't ask nobody nothin', really who know more than me?
Really who seen more than me?
Really who make more than me?
I'm just overthinking now
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Kept it gangsta for forever, just call that my energy
I'm just overthinking now

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Goin' back and forth and back
Goin' back and forth for what
Conversations with myself
Overthinking is a drug

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
And I'm overdosing, train off the tracks, locomotion
My way, big, spans like the ocean
Peace be still, ain't no commotion
Hocus pocus, watch them jokers
Keep my focus, 'til the locusts
Swarm, no harm done
'Twan, calm in the middle of the storm
I'm in the eye, also a pupil
Of the game, but don't stay neutral
Follow trends, now that's what you do
Jedi Master, they that booboo
Here that new new, Claimin' True to
Never fake, authenticate who
Fuck a password, hack the hackers
Back to the future, never backwards
Average bashers, new dimensions
Middle classers, losing pensions
Higher taxes, rules for women
Lower learning, lose the children
Lose the feeling

[Bridge: Big Boi]
Trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me
I said, trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
I can't ask nobody nothin', really who know more than me?
Really who seen more than me?
Really who make more than me?
I'm just overthinking now
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Kept it gangsta for forever, just call that my energy
I'm just overthinking now

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Goin' back and forth and back
Goin' back and forth for what
Conversations with myself
Overthinking is a drug

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Old school players to new school fools
But new niggas play without no rules
It's true when I say that I don't lose
The crew been on flame since Tri High School
Barbecue lit, light the coal
Tiptoein' through the two lips on swoll
Bold, cold, sometimes throwed
Only when I'm in Texas on Vogues
Candy paint, swangers swangin'
How these entertainers bangin'?
Cut the grass, kill the snakes
Fuck the past, fulfill your fate
'Cause hate don't make the day go great
Them folk gon' think what they gon' think
Just float yo' brain as your think tank
Attack like shark, don't take the bait
Octopuses spill the ink
Pop that pussy, kill the beat
Still a freak of nature when this ballpoint hit this paper
Boomeranging, 'cause I'm...

[Bridge: Big Boi]
Trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me
I said I'm trying to get it back, I think it's coming to me

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
If I ever got a question about how it's supposed to be
I can't ask nobody nothin', really who know more than me?
Really who seen more than me?
Really who make more than me?
I'm just overthinking now
They know who I am and they all got love for me
Kept it gangsta for forever, just call that my energy
I'm just overthinking now

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Goin' back and forth and back
Goin' back and forth for what
Conversations with myself
Overthinking is a drug
