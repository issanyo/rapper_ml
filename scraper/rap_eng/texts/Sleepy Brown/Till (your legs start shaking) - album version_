Uh uh uh, You know it's on right

Now that I've got you home with me tonight
They say I'd rather love cuz this feels so right
I'm on top of you, you're under me
There's no place in this world that I'd rather be
Oooh
I got my arms upon your legs as
You hold on girl don't be scared just
Tell me the secrets in your head as
I get into you
Must express your every motion
Fallen deep in who I chosen
You keep tellin me keep going
I know what to do

I won't stop till your legs start shaking
Keep on going till your legs start shaking
Every motion till your legs start shaking
To what I know till your legs start shaking
You're so good till your legs start shaking
Like I knew it boo till your legs start shaking
I don't stop till your legs start shaking
Till I reach the top till your legs start shaking

Oh now that the moment's here
Baby lift my cup for you to drink my dear, Baby
Oooh I know that you're lovin me
Don't be ashamed baby, go on and take that thang

Now that you're on top of me and
I caught up in your ecstacy and
I know that you're feeling me and
Every part of you
Must express your every motion
Fallen deep in who I chosen
I keep tellin you keep going
You know what to do

I won't stop till your legs start shaking
Keep on going till your legs start shaking
Every motion till your legs start shaking
To what I know till your legs start shaking
You're so good till your legs start shaking
Like I knew it boo till your legs start shaking

Till I reach the top till your legs start shaking

Keep on going till your legs start shaking
Every motion till your legs start shaking
To what I know till your legs start shaking
You're so good till your legs start shaking
Like I knew it boo till your legs start shaking
