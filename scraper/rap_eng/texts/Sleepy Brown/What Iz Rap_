[Big Rube]
It's the heart and soul
Of the niggas, and these dirty red walls and toes
It's a story of the day we lost all control
Not the times we boss balled with hoes
Not the rhymes we crossed-jawed with those
They flossed all they golds, and platinum too
Lemme school these motherfuckers on what rap been through
Whatever happened to, "Wave 'em side to side"
"Throw 'em in the air, lemme see yo' hands"
Now we smoke and ride, niggas ganstafied
Now all they wanna show is straps, ice, and brands
Niggas might be fast, they mistreated enough
You think they need they own brother to mislead 'em another inch
Lead 'em another inch, keep in most suspense
They need to just fuckin fence, these people is so intense
And fecal like full of shit, the say that yo' shit is a hit
And play you a whole lot, but pay you a little bit
Once you make 'em a whole lot, they started shakin the spot
They fakin the whole lot, deaf to 'em
I pray for the day that God lay rest to 'em
If I was him I wouldn't send one more breath to 'em
But that's best left to him, I won't digress for trim
I don't dress fresh for them, I ain't impressed by them bows
The devil can miss me with them hoes
Niggas wanna build they career on videos
That ain't rap..... {echoes}

"Ya don't stop, ya don't stop"
