[Chorus:]
One
Don't mess with the radio
Two
Don't tell me which way to go
Three
Just leave it up to me cause
Four
You riding with a pro

Five
You gotta leave it all behind
Six
We bout to get up in the mix now
Seven
Everyday is a blessing
Eight
Don't make no mistake about one

[Verse 1:]
I'm just riding out trying to figure out
What's up
This feeling can't be controlled
Trying not to look so fly

And it's 3:25
But I'm ready to roll
'Cause I've been waiting all week just to find
A party just to get out and jam
My destination's unclear
'Cause I know the party's wherever I am

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Now that the hour is 9:00
Time to check for this dime
Breaking hearts at the door

No time for standing in line
The beat is playin in my spine
And I can't take it no more

Throw your hands up
Let's cut this rug up
And party like it ain't no thang
We can do it all night 'til the daylight
No, it ain't no shame in my game, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
