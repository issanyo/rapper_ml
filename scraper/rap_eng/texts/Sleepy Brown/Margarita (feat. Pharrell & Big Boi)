(feat. Big Boi & Pharrell)

[Big Boi:]
5 O'clock
But I Stopped @ 4:59
Twist A Jay Of Some Hay
Got A Call From Sleepy Brown (Brown)

Say Its Going Down (Down)
Town, At The Lounge
Defintley Crowed With The Happy Hour Crowd
Drinks For A Dollar
Everybody's Buzzin, Cuzzin
Spittin Like A Major Leauge Pitcher
Tryna Cut Somethang
Only Throwin Balls No Strikes For Tonight
So Walk Up To Tha Chevy For Some Heavy Thinkin
Lets Ride
To My Underground Bungalow
Uproach The Mounds
Baby Im Tha Head Coach Now
Wow! Baby Need A Wet Cold Towel
Pharrel's On Tha Way So Stay And Play Awhile
(Sleepy Brown)
(For Real, Big Boy)

[Chorus: Pharrel]
I've Been Workin All Day
Now Im Done So See Ya
It's Time For Play
Name The Place, I'll Meet Ya
We Can Do Tha Bar
Sip Margarita's
Stay On Tha Floor
Go With Me 4 A Ride
Arent You Feelin Nice?
Dosent It Feel Nice?

[Sleepy Brown:]
Oh Baby, Do You Think That
Sittin In The Bar With What You Hangin
I Wonder If You Kno Im Watchin You
Cuz Everythang You Do Is So Bea-Ti-Ful
Oh, The Way U Run Your Finger (Over That Glass)
Oh, The Way You Look Over Your Shoulders (When You Dance)

So Maybe We Can Find Sum Place To Go

[Chorus: Pharrel]
I've Been Workin All Day
Now Im Done See Ya
