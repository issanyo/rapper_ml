Unh... yeah... you know uh... it's the A baby...

[Chorus: x2]
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (watch me) it's me (watch me)
It's me (girl, I'm so)
(Soul) so real (soul) so fly
(Soul) so wise (soul) so right
(I'm soul) so grown (soul) so on
(Soul) so on (soul)

[Verse 1:]
Cadillac night and caramel cake
Sittin' on vogues with golden flakes
Kangol tilted t'wards yo' way
Ridin' slow down M.L.K
I'm soul... I'm soul
That's soul... that's soul
A-Town's gleamin' 'cross my face
Everybody's watchin' me
Say pretty lady, are you hungry
We can go somewhere get some buff'lo wings
That's soul... that's soul
I'm soul... I'm soul
Later on we can do our thing
Sippin' while we're cuddling
Baby makin' love by the fireplace
While I'm whisperin' in yo' ear
I'm soul... I'm soul
That's soul... that's soul

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge: female singers]
You know that he's the soulest brother in the A, Town
The girls call him Pat, or Sleepy Brown
He got a mean ass walk, straight gangsta stroll
When he walks through the girls point they toes
'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him)
'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him)
'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him)
'Cause they love him (I love him) 'cause they love him (I love him)

[Verse 2:]
Women want, men wanna be
Oh so clean from my head to my feet
Out here hustlin', on these streets
Ain't nobody bad like me
I'm soul... I'm soul
That's soul... that's soul
If you hatin' gon' yo' way
If you want me here's where I stay
Where everybody knows my name
When you see me baby, throw up the A
I'm soul... I'm soul
That's soul... that's soul

[Chorus x2]
[music to end]
