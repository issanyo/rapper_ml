[Verse 1: André 3000]
Me and everything around me is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing back and forth
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say 'forget it'
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick...Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt
What am I s'posed do?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See, from bedknobs to broomsticks, we looking to start some new shit
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from West Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, "I'm proud of you people
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them mighties really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart
You looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour
These niggas, they leaving me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, 'cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch
