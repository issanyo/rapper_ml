[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew—'cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dickin the ho down, never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck; I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mama beeped me too"
She said she understood and everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning, dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home, to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

[Hook: Sleepy Brown + Big Boi]
It's like that now, you better go on
And get the hump up out your back now
It's about four or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

[Outro]
Grandmama – Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!
Keisha – Uh, Alright
Children – Grandmama, what’s all that noise? (I’m scared)
Grandmama – Baby don’t be scared, it’s gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' his work, okay?
