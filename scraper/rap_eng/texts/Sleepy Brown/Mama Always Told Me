[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Mama always told me
Where there's angels, there are demons
They just feed you what you lust for and try to shadow what you believe in
It's often pain you can't describe it
I see your eyes boy you can't hide it
Just remember hustle smart not hard
And he is here for guidance, always with you

[Verse 1: Sho Nuff]
My lifecycle is a rifle, shot and misguided
Praying to the savior it is he I must confide in
Grinding, took me from the streets to the studio
Plottin' with a dangerous mind like Coolio
Lurking, trying to figure out what's working
Hustle on the blacktop like Sam Perkins
Shifted, divine intervention, could've took my soul but instead bullets missing
And mama tellin' me, patience is a virtue, keep ya enemies close to, they might hurt you
Remember on the block, street lights was the curfew, you had to be inside or the belt would oblige
Listen, everybody living for commission, money is the object, survival of the fittest
Wanna live righteous but sin is committed
Backwudz, Dungeon Family is complete

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Mama always told me
Where there's angels, there are demons
They just feed you what you lust for and try to shadow what you believe in
It's often pain you can't describe it
I see your eyes boy you can't hide it
Just remember hustle smart not hard
And he is here for guidance, always with you

[Verse 2: Big Marc]
As I wake up, giving praise to my maker
Lord please don't let me fall apart like the Lakers
I hustle with my third eye watching soul takers
The root of all evil got me selling to my people
I'm pleasuring their pleasures but at the same time
I shorten up the lifespan deactivating minds
But shit what I'm pose to do if dinner ain't a problem
And shawty ridin' roun slippin' asking me to rob him (too easy)
But something been rattlin' my perception
As I see mo niggas in prison I'm learning lessons
As I see mo niggas get murdered I'm sending blessings
Hoping that your family coping and you in heaven
It's time for a switch like Caesar's for the reason
The road that my life leading has no meaning
Trying to paint a picture soul food read scripture
Mama say pray, you least expect it when it hit ya

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Mama always told me
Where there's angels, there are demons
They just feed you what you lust for and try to shadow what you believe in
It's often pain you can't describe it
I see your eyes boy you can't hide it
Just remember hustle smart not hard
And he is here for guidance, always with you

[Verse 3: Sho Nuff & Big Marc]
I do dirt by my lonely I let money console me
Homie but I would never let it control me
Or take me over, God please make me over
Mood swings up and down like I'm bi-polar
And now that I'm older, I see things differently
Learn from mistakes then erase em out my memory
Vividly you can see I'm sleeping with the enemy
Watching over backs for niggas who act finicky
Remy, in my glass drink away the problems
Look up in the clouds towards heaven he'll solve em
Call him, when you feel that sudden fear of falling
He right in arms reach, move your feet stop stalling

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]
Mama always told me
Where there's angels, there are demons
They just feed you what you lust for and try to shadow what you believe in
It's often pain you can't describe it
I see your eyes boy you can't hide it
Just remember hustle smart not hard
And he is here for guidance, always with you
