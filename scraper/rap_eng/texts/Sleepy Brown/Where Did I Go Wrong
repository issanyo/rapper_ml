Intro
Oh! Baby where did I go wrong do you know who
I am when my heart is nothing to do for
You set me free I am all alone in the rain and dark
With so much pain
Verse
Did you even see me crying here without no reason and
Never changed the season tell me why
It doesn't matter to you how much it hurt for me
And keep on asking me
Bridge
Say what you want from me don't stay here I will set
You free now and I get nothing for you
Go for it have another one and no more calls
And talks for me without halls
Chorus
Where did I go wrong say something for me please we need
To talk about these and don't go yet where not
Yet done talking to each other hey! I am so pleased of you
We don't walk in the park together in a
One place and cold or dark
Intro
I am sorry baby for making you mad please forgive me
And I have something to tell you
Just 1 thing 2 do 3 words 4 you " I Love You" don't ever
Forget the word that I gave to u
