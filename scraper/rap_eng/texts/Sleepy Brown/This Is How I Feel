[Intro: Big Boi]
Alligator shoes greener than that Gecko lizard
I post up on girls in the club from my pivot
They be with it, cause B-I is P-I
Frigid like a blizzard and see I be over they heads like midgets
But this is how I feel like a blind man reading
Is it Miss, Ms. or Mrs.? Gimme the rhyme or a reason
Gimme the time and the season
Earth,-wind-and-fire-breathing dragon when I'm skeeting
Goin deeper and deeper and deeper

[Verse 1: Sleepy Brown]
Ooh... what a night
It's time to party, do your thang and make it right
Don't stop, do what you do
Just relax and let the groove take over you
Cause you know that..

[Chorus: Kelly Rolland] (Sleepy Brown)
I can't help the way I feel, cause I'm so right tonight
(This is how I feel - how I feel now
Music moves me in every way now)
There's a party going on in here
And it don't stop 'til the morning light
(This is how I feel - how I feel now
Music moves me left and right)

[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown]
Girl, I like what I see
Just sip back your drink and slide right next to me
The way you move, you look so fine
Makes me wanna get up on you one more time
Cause you know

[Chorus]

[Spanish interlude]
Ooh, esta musica, me hace sentir tan bien...

[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]
Ooh, gone and shake your body baby (shake it to the groove)
Girl, you got me sweating (by the way your body moves)
Temperature is rising (cause there's nothing else to do)
Do your thang (do your thang), do your thang (do your thang)

[Chorus]
