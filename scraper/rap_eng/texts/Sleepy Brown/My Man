* Carlos Santana only plays guitar

[Intro - Big Boi]
Booooooom, boooooom, booooom...
Santana's in the room
Booooooom, boooooom, booooom...
Mary J's in the room
Booooooom, boooooom, ba-BOOM booom...
Big Boi, Beat Bullies let's ride, WOOF!!

[Chorus 2X - Mary J. Blige]
I got a man and he's so good to me
I give love and he gives it back to me
Say it for me once if you know what I mean
I said, my man's what a man's supposed to be

La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
Aaaaah, la-da-da-daaaaa

[Verse One - Mary J. Blige]
He opens his arms, and holds on to me
He tells me he loves me, and ohhh I feeeeel it
And all that I am, and all that I'll be-ee
Is there in his eyes, when I hear him sayin' pleeeeeease

[Big Boi (Sleepy Brown)]
(Who loves you baby?) I do, I do trust you
See see this ain't just bout havin sex, I don't even have to touch you
But you lustful I'm buggin, you feel me bulgin while we huggin
We all over one another - scattered, covered, smothered
You're my choosey lover, never lovin others, only rubbin me [me]
Satisfy Big to the utmost mentally and physically [-ly]
Every king must crown a queen to make his kingdom mean anything
Thro', thick and slim we gon' win, we a TEAM by any means, shy'all

[Chorus 2X]

La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
Aaaaah, la-da-da-daaaaa

[Verse Two - Mary J. Blige]
The TOUCH of his hand, the sound of his voice
The way that he loves me, 'til he knows I feeeeel it
And all through the night, forever rejoice
The angel above me, starts to sweetly sing to meeeeeeee...

[Big Boi (Sleepy Brown)]
(Who loves you baby?) I do, I do adore you
I'm the best man for the job, another man couldn't do nothin for ya
Cause you're spicy just like me, we come together like thunder and lightning
With all of that scratchin and bitin - so excitin it's frightening!
I'm your do-right MAN and you're my do right not my just for to-night woman
Makin me feel just like a baker - quick to put sumthin in your oven!
Not no dumplin's or no stuffin but our own lil' flesh and blood'n
A bouncin lil' baby sumthin, pretty gurl or handsome son chiiiiild..

[Chorus]

La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
La-la-la-laaaaaaaaa (laaaa-laaaa-laaaaa)
Aaaaah, la-da-da-daaaaa

[Outro - Mary J. Blige]
He opens his arms...
And hooooooooolds on to me...
I got a man, yeah..
I got a maaaan, yeah yeeaaaaaaah, yeah
(My man's what a man's supposed to be...)
It's what a man's supposed to be
Yeah, 'ey, eyyyyyy-EYYYYYYYY
