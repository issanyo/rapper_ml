I lose all control
When you grab a hold
And you do your trick
I love it when you lick

Lick
You've got lock and key
Every part of me
Know what makes me tick
I love it when you lick

Lick
I'll put my heels on for you baby
The ones that wrap all around my leg
Your every touch excites me
And damnit I ain't too proud to beg
And even when you're not around me
The tingling just won't go away
Don't make my body wait no longer
Because this pussycat's ready to play play play play play

I lose all control
When you grab a hold
And you do your trick
I love it when you lick

Lick
You've got lock and key
Every part of me
Know what makes me tick
I love it when you lick

Love it when you lick
Lick
It feels so good I'm going crazy
My eyes roll back inside my head
Explore my inner warmths of pleasure
And hold on tight
Hope you ain't scared
I promise I'll return the favor
I'll do that trick you can't resist
Two rights don't make it wrong
Makin' love 'till the break of dawn
Emotions all up in a twist twist twist twist twist

I lose all control
When you grab a hold
And you do your trick
I love it when you lick

Lick
You've got lock and key
Every part of me
Know what makes me tick
I love it when you lick

Lick
I'll put my heels on for you baby
The ones that wrap all around my leg
Your every touch it just excites me
And damnit I ain't too proud to beg
And even when you're not around me
The tingling, the tingling won't go away
Don't make my body wait no longer
Because this pussycat's ready to play play play play play

Oh oh sing
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da
Ba da ba ba ba
Ba ba
Ba ba
Ba ba

I lose all control
When you grab a hold
And you do your trick
I love it when you lick

Lick
You've got lock and key
Every part of me
Know what makes me tick
I love it when you lick
