[Verse 1: T-Mo]
Let me get a chop at this lumber
Niggas from down Underground they hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or livin' lavish yet, but you can bet
That when I do, nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to brawl 'cause I fall a victim
So I still be slangin' them fat pillows to make 'em meet
Each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been a part of this mess
'Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men, if you black, you in
Food for the soul, listen to what I tell you
It don't matter young or old, it's time we loc' up
And do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We trapped off in this world's society with no place else to go
So how you feel?

[Verse 2: Khujo]
Frustrated, irritated
Sometimes I don't know myself, I be too numb
To feel something sometimes, so I dig deep
Get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness
So I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes
It keep me from snappin', keeps me calm
Keeps my mind open, keeps me fond
Of what I gots to do off in the studio
To get my old bird back on her feet
And my little bro in Statesboro
And my little cuz Mark Twain, all my folks that hang with me
When I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only God knows
What I go through, so I get down on my knees
Sometimes I come home too high to pray
But I get on my bed, lay on my back
And meditate, anyway, in the ceiling
The four walls, it's like cell therapy
Got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E
Put it down on paper...
Man, so what you feelin' like?

[Bridge: Cee-Lo & Khujo]
I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
There's people killin' in the street to eat
Survivin’ the day is the only goal that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
My head felt swoll, messed up, couldn't see past my mouth
“What route did you take, man?” Got me by the loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' the traffic pass me by
No questions, I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin' the law, naw man, Gipp
Showed him my shit, closed my mouth then I dip
See to me a G is a person who understands the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for the hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Fowlkes made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in this place for ‘96, shit's slick
Car be clean lookin' fresh, dog be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who, ain't none iller
Than Miller, wanna 1-2 your ass
No more life what you gave is the past, cause ain't no future
Wanna “Miller camp” your case, disgrace your face
Make it seem to be safe, ain't no place to run

[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on TV
But hell, it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone
God dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have more but I kinda like bein' poor
At least I know what my friends here for
I wanna lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I wanna tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's niggas hurtin' and uncertain about
If they gon' make it or not, that's why we got niggas killing
Feelin' like they comin' up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
'Cause without you, there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess
And it still won't relieve your stress
God bless... my thought process

[Verse 5: André 3000]
The thought process... Now-
Now as an Outkast, I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of ups and downs like it ain't nothin'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking
No, I'm sittin' on the Lincoln 4 AM thinking
That in reality the world is like a ball full of players
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayer is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing, that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play, right?
Huh, the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never thought about hittin' licks or slangin' 'caine
Did not think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me "murderer" because my ass is scorchin'
Hot from the Glock that sits under my seat
Yeah, it's real fucked up that my folks come to get me
And it's like dat...yeah, uh-huh, yeah, and it's like dem!
