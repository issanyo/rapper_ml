[Intro]
What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

[Verse 1 : Andr√© 3000]
You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

[Hook]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Verse 2 : Sleepy Brown]
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get every drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

[Hook]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Verse 3 : Big Rube]
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

[Hook]
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
