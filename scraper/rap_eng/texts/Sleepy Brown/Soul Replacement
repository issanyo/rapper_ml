[Intro: Sleepy Brown]
Ah, this is Boonchie
Coolin' with Pebbles, Society of Soul
Looking for your soul, yeah

[Chorus: Society of Soul]
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing

[Verse 1: Pebbles]
Take a look around at all the things that are going down
I can't help but think that you might lose your head sometimes
Don't get caught up in the bad things this life can bring
Be encouraged by the message in this song I sing

[Chorus: Society of Soul]
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing

[Verse 2: Pebbles]
There are days we see the harshness of reality
Why let it be a hindrance to your positivity
And with this thought in mind, don't hesitate to try
To make it easier for someone who gets lost along the way

[Chorus: Society of Soul]
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing

[Bridge: Sleepy Brown]
Ah, please don't fool yourself after all you've gone through
Not knowing where you've been, but baby, you still don't have a clue, woo
To where you're headed in your life, take those blinders off your eyes
You'll always be two steps behind, ah, until you realize

[Chorus: Society of Soul]
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing

[Spoken Word: Big Rube]
Soul replacement
The direct opening of the eyes of someone engulfed in the negative
The soul is what makes human beings more than the sum of their parts
It's that essence deep down in your inner self
A voice that tells you right from not right
My existence is dedicated to the full reinstatement of my folks as the original and true heirs of the planet Earth
But first we all have to go through a soul replacement
Though you aren't responsible for the displacement
You cannot continue to ignore your true nature once you obtain knowledge of self
The Black man and woman are kings and queens that master the art, science, mathematics, physics, and just about every other asset that we enjoy in so-called civilization long ago
The only luxury we didn't enjoy was future great men and women dying by the hands of other future great men and women
This is Big Rube from Society of Soul
Letting you know the way we going ain't the way we need to be going
Peace out

[Chorus: Society of Soul]
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your time you shouldn't be wasting
But in reality it's your soul that needs replacing
Take a look at what you're facing
It's your mind I'm embracing
Don't you that it is your soul that needs replacing
