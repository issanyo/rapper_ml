[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Got me moving slow as a love ballad
All up in the club she like all her thugs tatted
As the radio plays return of the drug addict
Mama youngin was raised they taught me that love matters
I can see all your flaws, hiding them not at all
Niggas reaching new heights then shortly they fallin off
Michael I'm off the wall, typical art of war
Everybody's the plug but none you niggas in charge
Criminal still at large, fatal just kill em off
Niggas is closed minded the label should get involved
Bitches cheating on you, ain't no lovin' on the menu
Now she with the other nigga like you with the hotter single
Mama got another favorite, daddy disappointed in you
And they came to get the caddy, how you gettin to the venue
Need of revenue, please never let em Jerry Heller you
As the regret screams, I pray that the weed settles you
Nothing is worse than having it and then losing it
The hunger starts fading and then you become cool with it
Overnight pjs to coach class stewardess
Nothing change I can smell vh1 moving in
I'm the one you should ask for
It's all the same song what you spinning it back for
I swear your last record should've been your last choice
Shit is looking like radio made the trap star
The sing along

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Niggas talk about keys and we sing along
Preach
Niggas talk about bitches and we sing along
Ohh Preach
Everything codeine, and ya bankroll mean
Nigga I'm sleep
You didn't even sell your soul it was free
It's like you got the same shit on repeat
Niggas talk about keys and we sing along
Preach
Niggas talk about bitches and we sing along
Ohh Preach
Everything codeine, and ya bankroll mean
Nigga I'm sleep
You didn't even sell your soul it was free
It's like you got the same shit on repeat

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Ima sight for blind eyes, ribbon in sky
Vision 20/20 nobody gifted as I
Gotta take care your people my nigga sit and divide
Gotta be bout the love and only spit when inspired
Lyrical genocide, forever immortalized
Numb to the fame, never succumb to the corporate ties
Rappers are borderline, stuck in a normal mind
I kill em all and lay em in front as the organ cries
I'm alive pay your tax never let a comma slide
Crazy like lookin In damas eyes
If I say it all they plotting on my demise
Phenomenon, I'm a god
I arrived in all black nigga cause they don't follow the format
Of raw rap, tell me what the fuck do you call that
Quiet nigga better believe I'm bout all that
They all whack
It gets worse cause the niggas that we love gave you niggas a hall pass
Same song and we all dance
Why you dropping the ball uhh, another dark cloud on a poor black
Brother trying to make it so I gotta support the sing along


[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Niggas talk about keys and we sing along
Preach
Niggas talk about bitches and we sing along
Ohh Preach
Everything codeine, and ya bankroll mean
Nigga I'm sleep
You didn't even sell your soul it was free
It's like you got the same shit on repeat
Niggas talk about keys and we sing along
Preach
Niggas talk about bitches and we sing along
Ohh Preach
Everything codeine, and ya bankroll mean
Nigga I'm sleep
You didn't even sell your soul it was free
It's like you got the same shit on repeat
