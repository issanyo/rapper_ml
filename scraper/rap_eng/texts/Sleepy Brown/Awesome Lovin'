[Verse 1]
Baby, here we lay
Staring at each other
Girl, I love to say
Your love me like no other
I'm so here to stay
Play from day 'til night, baby
Loving as we lay
Hearing each other say...

[Chorus]
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it gives me chills
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it's such a thrill
It's such a thrill

[Verse 2]
Loving here again
Taking our sweet time, baby
Can't remember when
Love felt so right now
Tell you once again
You're all I need, baby
Burning candles in
While we say it again

[Chorus]
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it gives me chills
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it's such a thrill
It's such a thrill

[Bridge]
Love, love, love, love
Woo

[Chorus]
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it gives me chills
You got that awesome lovin'
Girl, I'm for real
Every time I think about it
Girl, it's such a thrill
It's such a thrill
