[Verse 1]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she's by his side
I'm so sorry I hurt you so much
Please answer my prayer
Can't keep himself out of trouble
Can't keep himself out of trouble
But these prayers ain't helping at all
I made my way
The best way I know how

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
Going

[Verse 2]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
She's so good to me
She's so good to me
One day he goes and take a look at the mirror
But doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
May we all find peace
In our final resting place

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

[Spoken]
Stop moving so fast

[Chorus]
Don't go
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

[Outro]
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
