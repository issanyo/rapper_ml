Lord it's so hard, living this life
A constant struggle each and every day
Some wonder why I'd rather die
Than to continue living this way
Many are blind and cannot find
The truth cause no one seems to really know
But I won't accept that this is how it's gon' be
Devil you gotta let me and my people go

Cause I wanna be free, completely free
Lord won't you please come and save me
I wanna be free, totally free
I'm not gon' let this world worry me
