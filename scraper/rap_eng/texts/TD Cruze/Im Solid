[Intro]
It's Lil B, bitch

[Verse 1]
Pussy niggas fuck, but you better have them Pampers
I had to clear my mind out, took a trip into the Hamptons
A mental trip, and I slept up in the mansion
These niggas drive me crazy, I started to feel like Charles Manson
I need the fucking ransom, make him stick his hands up
That nigga' hands up, make him look like a dancer
The piece will pull your pants up, bitch, or make your ass run
Silver barrels where I'm from, Tate taught me how to shoot first
School was for schoolboys, I wanna learn to move purp
Niggas see I'm eating, niggas see the dude jerk
My job to watch niggas, shit, that was like my schoolwork
But only did night school, nighttime was glide time
Early...up before the sunshine
Eat before it's lunchtime, and smash before it's crunch time
Yeah boy, I was knee deep up in the bloodline
Uncle was a gangsta, brother was a gangsta
Mama was a savage, and daddy was a prankster
So what the fuck that make me? The product of a prankster
The product of a gangster, I'm something like a anchor
Talk in front of niggas like: What the fuck? You ain't shit
Ain't never been a gangsta, my moral-like relations
I fuck with the gangsters, we ride around and pace 'em
Throw 'em up, the B-Unit with the rangers
Niggas park with Range's, limo's with the...
Busting up these faces
Ben and big faces, niggas can't see us
I love you, I'm stationed

[Outro]
I'm solid nigga
Let's go, we good
