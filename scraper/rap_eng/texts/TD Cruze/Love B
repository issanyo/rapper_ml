[Intro]
Yea man it's ya boy Lil B
Worldwide, I love you
Ya feel me?
I know ya'll been waiting
For the rawest rapper alive
Ya feel me?
Hands up, yeah, one time
You know what im sayin
Ya'll gotta fuck with the real
Check it

[Verse 1: Lil B]
I'm hotter then hot; nigga my blocks is hot
My watch is cold, watching out for the front
I'm out the front, nigga, I'm through the back
Your past is back, threw it back
I'm shooting the packs; went through straps
At Wal-Mart, nigga, them customer classics
I seen dope rock, same color as ice
Dope so big it look like Zeus
Oakland got crack like Big got Juice
I hold straps like Dykes with the cooch
Tired of the streets, all night got the roof
This shirt so hot, the same price as my coupe
500 cash, nigga that's the fucking truth
Tell the whole world that I did, they wouldn't move
If there wasn't no me, nigga, there wouldn't be you
If there was no you, hell, there's no me
Tell the world about that
Speaking off zips not knowing what to get
Summer was the best: had money, new checks
Pounds of the weed mean lots of respect
Respect got me the new house with the bitch
Beat niggas up like uncles or your cousin
I'm gutta like them niggas in the hood that's thuggin'
Still in the bathroom, still in the classroom
Still wanna learn about how I survived the drought
Nigga first hand, first glance, can't judge
I'm an American Idol but i can't judge
I'm solid like your door but I won't budge
This the code of honor; nigga don't break or budge
I wanna find real then until I love me
I love the people
But do you really love me?
I love the people
But do you really love B?

[Outro]
Put your hands up if you do
Lil B for life
05 Fuck Em
Let's ride
