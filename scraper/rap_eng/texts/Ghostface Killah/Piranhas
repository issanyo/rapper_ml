[Intro: Raekwon]
Hey yo
Hey yo man, come on, man, stop playin' man
Hey yo, get busy, nigga
Don't know what the fuck you be doing over here, man
Let these niggas know how it pop off, man
Word up, man
Yo take my card, my nigga
Hey yo

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
He was a serpent, too many foul moves was made
No love amongst the wicked, gotta get his head severed
I caught him in Miami, I was heavily armed
Blew an O-Z of that Blue Dream, I'm ready and calm
Fiendin' just to do him dirty, already got the plan mapped out Snatched him up and headed back to the hideout
Welcome, here some exercised torture
This is everyday work, ice cold grills with no smirks
Seen em' frontin' with some skeezers
Actin' like he's a boss with no rank, pussy posin' as a leader
Had a bitch with me from the island, a true man-eater slash diva
Dark skin Geneva, I sent her over, told her to persuade em'
Walked him outside, tossed him in the trunk and then we slide
Got to the house, tied him up, plastic on the carpets
Tub full of piranhas, I threw him in and watched him holla

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah
Yo
Caused hell on your receptionist, a foreigner's pharmacist
You all in my face, who wanna put a star on it?
Scarface, big tour bus with the bar in it
Jets with the escalator steps with your moms in it
Electric stove, she holdin' my gold medals
Hairy chest, don't mistake me for Burt Reynolds
This is baller alert, confetti fallin', I'm no taller with work
Spit bars that's enlarged in the earth, keep my gun cryin'
I don't mean clarks, when I say, "Yo, there's so many dyin'"
Starks' second to last, nigga on triumph
Rob me, I'm comin' with bears, no lyin'
Step outside with that Michael aura
Me and my team jumpin' off yachts in Bora Bora
Hennessy privileged, Tito's goose water
Motion picture screens crack when they record us

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Same old bullshit, ya'll respect ignorance
Niggas, I'll split your fuckin' head with the quickness
Sure improve intelligence, back about my business
As far back as I can remember, it's been gangsta
Had to hustle hard make it better
Kept a nickel plated .32 behind the dresser
Show me where she kept it in case of any pressure
Friends all fresher, tired of havin' lesser
Workin' wasn't workin', 40 hours overtime, pockets still hurtin'
Big decision makin', knew a few Jamaicans, brung me in
Showed me how to win, camouflage blend, watch for the shark fin
Osiris of the sea cypher, circlin' the serpent 10% sellin' you a dream
Fiends comin' to cop, I won't stop till it's got, gettin' it
I won't stop till it's got, gettin' it

[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
(Keep your mouth shut)
When I see that guppy I'ma give him the business
We all know, he be talkin' to the witness, smell the foulness
He a trader and all that, he all out of his space, put him in his place
I can't give up the grace, I can see the devil in his face
I'm in the hood, comin' down the fire escape
A lot of cats can't see me, I'm the great ape
Machine gun in my hand, headed down the fire escape
Yo Rae, if they violate give 'em set date
Because tomorrow I'ma be movin' to Cali
Gold teeth nigga, bring back Ballys, I'm out here
Pumpin' these mafuckin' raps, yo eighty, show these niggas what we do to wax
Hip-hop nigga, don't make me come out my starter hat
Blow all these fake niggas off the face of the map
Then I'ma hit syllable up, call up the cartel
Doin' hot shit, goin' through hell, police popped my homie, now it's time to rebel
Real niggas, no matter what, don't tell, ahh
