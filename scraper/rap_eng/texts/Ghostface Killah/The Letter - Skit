[Skit]
Yo, whattup fam?
Ain't nothin yo, just thinkin and shit, you know what i'm sayin
I know you ain't fine over there fam
Nah, nah, nah, nah, just chillin and shit, you know how shit be
You know what I'm sayin?
Just wrote my moms this letter, think you should check this out

[Outro]

Sunday was a bright day, yesterday
Hoo, but he's gone today
A dark cloud has come into the way
Hoo, is taking him away
Why did he leave me?
Why did he go?
Didn't I tell him how much
I loved him so?
Now all I'm left here to do
Is dream about you

*Paper crumbling*

I'm sorry [?] I can't take her back
