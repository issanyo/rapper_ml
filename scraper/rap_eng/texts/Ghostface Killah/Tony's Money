* Bonus track on the LP Version of "Put it on the Line"

[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, ain't nothing man
Niggas, niggas just should of paid me my stacks, man
You know whatimean, these niggas sending me tracks
And ain't try'nna not to pay the kid, man
But fuck that, fuck 'em
I don't give what producers -- who produced, what
I'm deading niggas on they tracks, what
Cock suckers fucking with me..
Yeah, yo, this what happens when niggas send me shit
And don't pay me my fucking money

[Hook 2X: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo (come on), Pretty Toney should of got his dough
We was rhymin through the brooms and street, with eight years old
Take us back to eighty eight, you couldn't catch our flow
A group of kids, so original, (you heard?)

[Ghostface Killah]
Tony 'Tana with big hammers, for bad manners, who got 'em
We kiss cannons for Scrams and his crew, and his wack dancers
Biting is forbidden, pa, pay that tax
And don't you ever look at us funny, come on, boy, we'll bring rap back
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men
With dynomites, real hip-hop'll do you in
Floor you like Dyu Ku Kim, I'm loo-looing
Hoola hoop on bitches, cuckoo for brand new pins
Cut Masta Killa, make sure we cut classics
Buck bastards in broadday and tuck caskets
Next to Uday and Qusay, hopped in the coupe, shoot the P.A
And just lay, whooptie, whooptay
Use to loose spaldings, and snatch a dude's toupee
Since tuning in, to T-La Rock and A.J
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of O.J
Girls you can go cruisin in my O'Jay

[Hook]
