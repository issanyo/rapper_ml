[Hook: Bilal]
A resurrection morning
The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the Ghost controls the soul

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear, touch, and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my seed and start healing these scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Kane, you better show me
You a man of your word, fuck the criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
Fuck it, I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamt about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I offer my soul to be relinquished

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Lifeless, his body left slumped in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, let alone a ruthless killer
Crime boss syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seed in this cold world, my heart's aching

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels all thick and clusty
Me, the father, and rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Kane or did I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life of running in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you as one force
There's no limit to where we can take it
Time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dine on exotic foods
Help the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
Son you hesitating - I didn't hesitate for you
When it was my time to go, I cocked it and showed prove

[Hook: Bilal]
A resurrection morning

The sacrifice
