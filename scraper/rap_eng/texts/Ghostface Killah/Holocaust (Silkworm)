[Intro: Holocaust, (Ms. Roxy)]
(Bobby Digital) Wu-Tang Killa Beez
(It's all about Bobby, I'm floating in your galaxy)

[Verse 1: Holocaust]
You falling down a endless tunnel of doom reality
Graphically my Killa Bee family stings the galaxy
Insanity, titanium stomach devouring Guinness
My flesh is solid stone despite my outer appearance
Still disease kills viruses, planets and racial creatures
Made MCs sprout tumours so bad, lost facial features
Waste your peoples left out in the rain, fountains of pain
Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shouting my name
Holocaust, black man whose veins littered with thorns
Back smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed
Swarm dorms, sting birds, fling verbs like mean curves
Strike three, mics flee, I infect 'em with green germs
Ringworm cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly mastery
My felony melody has to be a bastard's masterpiece
Stop grafting me, chump-ass niggas eyeing me, tempt me
I'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty
Spitting darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hideout
Rock crush or German suplex, watch spines slide out
The side route, forearm bash with twenty jabs
On the ave or your lab, get stabbed and bloodied bad
While I'm sipping herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds
Bitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees
Circle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus
Got Oscar nominee MCs stuck to my hatchet
Drastic indescribable pain, I injure bars
While Bobby's throwing razor CDs like ninja stars

[Break: RZA]
Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh
Yo, yo, drop down a manhole, yo I rap ammo
Blows out your candle, check, yo

[Verse 2: RZA]
Drop down a manhole, I rap ammo, blows out your candle
Have Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Gano
Release the info, .44 increase your heart tempo
Scared your ass, you jumped through a closed window
To a hundred beats per a second, my mic's secret weapon
Infuriate your style to that of Led Zeppelin
Encyclopaedia Britannica, Hanna-Barbera
World of Super Adventure couldn't give a proper word
Of the scripture of my manner
You're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal
MCs delight popcorn, we popping every kernel
Jot this in your journal, we hot like a thermal
Nuclear explosion, undermine control of your country
Like the Federal Enforcement Management Agency
My technique be vocabulary freak
C-cyphers say my divine is like Dante's Peak
At most, you'll be trapped off in Patmos
Get smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast
King Cobra black brew pack and bare foot
On the roof dusted out, waiting for chariots
Popping like Orville Redenbacher or Betty Crocker
The Pop Secret is the .45 Glock popper
Control men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard
American Express privileges, blood spillage
We got more bars then billets, Star-Spangled Banner
Soldier stand up, Cobra Commander stop the propaganda
Thirty shot banana clip, full-loaded, radar scanners get decoded
Digital warfare torments your head, eyes bloated
Heads exploded, poison darts quoted
American eagle stinging up Blue Beetle Bailey
On the rocks mixed with Hennessey daily
Keep thee scaly Israeli niggas from the Clan
We bide the Amish that'll harness the promised land

[Verse 3: Dr. Doom]
You can't escape from the Doctor of Doom, my lyrics zoom on buffoons
And take flight like witches brooms at full moon
On all you Dum-Dums, wash your filthy rhymes away like soap scum
The warlord swing flaming swords just like a shogun
Of the darkness, my scriptures cause arson like flaming arches
My Killa Bee sting remains accurate like a marksman
So take precaution, we attack like black Martians
Corner the market by using digital strategies
Reefer sparks my acid battery, y'all niggas flatter me
With all that tough talk, I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock
From the outside or the inside, create intense rides
When my pen glides all MCs will get their head fly
For talking shit, lyrics always strike throughout my dungeon pit
Killa Bees must reign supreme throughout the continent
We conquered it, motherfuckers

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
The beat terminal, exquisite young Cooley High production
Caught up in the hollow head suction
Ten pogo sticks, two black belts that break bricks
Diet Coke meetings with the rich, I'm faithfully
Married to Rap, we've been engaged for twelve years
Tyson bit Holyfield's ear, we love the sport
Look out your window, now see, pull up the shade
Y'all be amazed, me Tony Starks spaceship
Ran by a Duracell, the only man out walked through Hell
Dick swinging like shit went well
Call it the mighty Joe Young, double swirl slush
Wonder Woman's sapphire shit with the pearls
It looked real nice yo, heavy on the gravy
Dirt bagged the secretary in the graze
She typed eighty words from whirlwinds to whirlpools
Openly sea, watch the Earth spin, Sunny dance with the serpent
Who shot JJ it was Mudbone, the same nigga riding the train
Same nigga with his name on his jacket
Swift and changeable, inhaled the bad bag of that Jason
Fell out twice in the basement, straight up and down y'all
