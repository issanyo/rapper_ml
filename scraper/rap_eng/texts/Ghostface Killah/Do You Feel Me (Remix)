[Anthony Hamilton]
Wish I could see through, see deep into you
And know what you're thinking now
And if I'm what you needing
I need some kind of sign
Let me know cuz I can't read your mind
Are you in? Or am I in this on my own?
I need some clue from you, let me know babe

[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Do you feel me? Do you read me?
Tell me am I gettin' through to you
I wanna know, are you with me? Are you listenin'?
Baby, is my message gettin' through?
Do you feel me baby, oh babe, cuz I can feel you

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, can I ask you one question? How you feel about the prince of love?
You start buggin', when I ask you, for my back to rub
With no response, I gave you my heart
Your mind seem like it's all over the place like art
Hold on, this ain't the girl I met, you used to stay focused
We'd laugh, we did the apartment, and bombed the roaches
If you really want me to bounce, would you let me know?
Don't cold shoulder me and have me figure it out on the low
Cuz that's not fair, I wouldn't do it back, I sware
And when we get old, I'll be the one, pushing your chair
And the way you making me feel, I can drop a tear
I need a hug from you, baby, like you hug your bear, come here

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, baby blue nine in the night box, stacks of cash
Rubberbanded up, stuffed in some all white socks
Fuck a detox, the Doe Rehab, got me signing my gun
So if any nigga try to come to the lab
I let the AR fifth bang, the streets is leery
We movin' eightballs through hands like the Fists of Fury
Ya'll blow five d's a week, just to clean my jewelry
Another hundred grand, to pay off the judge and jury
We flood the streets like bad news stars, blow our Nextels all night
Even though they taping our codes, fuck The Wire
I inspired them Cocaine Cowboys, muthafucka
