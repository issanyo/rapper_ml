[Verse 1:Josho Osho]
Sweet, sweet were the memories
Song and the symphony
That we had yesterday
Ohh, free, free were these city roads
But now I feel so over grown
And hard to escape
But deep beyond the surface lies ..
Before it’s so unjustified still you carry on
You’re a soldier, oh you’re a fighter
Now don't waste another day just take what comes your way

[Hook]
If you know what you want to feel how high
Do you want to feel it
If you know what you want to say oh I wanna hear you say it
If you know where you wanna go how far, do you wanna take it
‘cause no matter what mistakes you’ve made
These are your redemption days

[Verse 2:Josh Osho]
No white flag outside your door
Never gave for the sure for an easy get away
You’re mind looking out for circumstance
Is really gonna make the difference
To know the right game to play
And voices tell to be hold
Upon the wreckage lies soul
That knows the path to fields of gold
It’s where you wanna reach
You’re a soldier you’re a fighter
Don't go and waste another day just take what comes your way

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Ghostface Killah]
For the Holy day cometh when you chose your desitnation
The day come when you choose your destination
A man sacrifice his life for salvation
So we can sing Bob Marley songs of redemption
You a believer or non-believer, there's no exception
I walk through the ashes when the Lord burn the sinners
Bare footed, all draped out in linens
Repentended, I lived though sacrifice
And now I wait my eternal residence in paradise
I walk the righteous path through the garden of eden with the enlighted mind I got from the knowledge of readin'
Hard to believe I achieve through the devine intervention
I’m a soldier I’ll be standing on the day of redemption

[Hook]
