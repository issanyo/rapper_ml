[Intro]

NBA Finals 1992 MJ "The Shrug" sample

[Raekwon]
Wall to wall.. that's my word
I own approximately.. everything you got
The verdict.. that's right

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yo...
Call me the black champion, Guess down, wanna test now
So let's grab the mack and vest, bless him if he stressed out
Amazing, blazing Purple Haze spaceships
Blazin asians in Mercedes Benz stations
Yo, moving through the tavern, guns that burn, sons that learn
Stabbin an intern, corporate book of words
Iceatollah Motorolas, gun reloaders, broads with rollers
When wet lens stole us, Lex glowers who owe us
Call up Comissionary Gordon, son go warn the Warden
That the lord is back, rolling with his sword again
Mixtape, masturbation mate rate plates ice traits
Guns with bitches jumping outta white cakes
It's on for real, indeed, Lex Leonardo
Shells that's hollow, six whipper through the 52 globe of horror
Carry the stainless steel armor
Nurture the church avenue drama, yo, African gold from Ghana
Puffin these marijuanas make Allah catch Alzheimers
Feedin bread to birds yellin fuck old timers

[Hook: Raekwon]
It's called game, I'll get ya life killed, game recognize
Right wills, game slight chills things stay the same
Game, subliminary mills, smash grills, night chills
Regardless what pah things won't be the same again
I'll get ya life killed, game recognize
Right wills, game slight chills things stay the same
Game, subliminary mills, smash grills night chills
Mic skills baby pah won't be the same again

(check this out, one two)
(yeah-yeah… this is me, P… no doubt)

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Segregate those fake poems
Separate the bullshit from the authentic
Vintage rhyme division got the globe listening
My rap scroll belittled your goals and visions
Prohibition got my whole block pissing Christians
One-fifty-one Dunn'll have you off balance walkin
Don't let your emotions get involved, talkin
To the wrong culprit, the killer be the soft spoken
So what's ya intentions, you want to glow for the moment?
Throw on your two pennies, then you bolting
I rock for the few chosen, who got their third minds open
Write a page that'll engage war and encite fights
Be on the look for the bright lights and North winds
The trumpets be the mics, the size malevolent
You don't belong in my eyesight, P's a powerful soldier
Other life and things won't be the same again
It's over!

[Hook 2]
It's called game, I'll get ya life killed, game recognize
Right wills, game slight chills things stay the same
Game, subliminary mills, smash grills, night chills
Regardless what pah things won't be the same again
I'll get ya life killed, game recognize
Right wills, game slight chills things stay the same
Game

(You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be...)

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
MC Ultra high-brolic bank roll alcohol vulture
Garlic balls dice the shield of ocre
Tally ho pitty-pat backgammon pro
Pink salmon five spring rolls know me, you love my intro
Half a face wig sewed together like Manhattan Chase
Looking like snatching the place, check behind the drapes
Castor Troy layin for Travolta mic gun pump
Laying on the floor Clark's bleeding watermelon chunks
Hold up... sprinkle the hash, Tony chapstick
Snatch RZA last piece of fish right off the glass dish
Butter roll beats bagel tracks wavey hair decks
Lay it down straw hat style, Butterball crown
Time life investments, when broke I wrote the old testament
Crashed domes now perform excellence
Words with the President, brunch with Yeltsin
Gorbachev under Meth's nuts, he out in Belgium
Six and a half monkeys, twelve nazis
Four disappear, three eight two one flash to thin air
God's replica no wheel drive motionless mind cresica
Tilt the hat like Escher

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Pete Rock]
Aiyyo, I rumble into action, son I'm right on target
Legendary status with the way the track started
It's on, at any second with the high stakes
Drama, the game's teeth sharp like piranhas
There's a million style biters who try to create
Make no mistake real niggas challenge the fake
Most valuable SP-1200 gold medals
Rae Prodigy Ghost rhyme professional
The original, Pete Rock is like Soul on Ice
Dynamite with the mic device
Now roll the dice, for the game of death
Snake eyes baby pah, the Boy Wonder's a threat
