[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo
Get the money, they keep it tucked away in a safe
In the back room by the wine bottles and grapes
Hit 'em where it hurts, they can't find shit and they broke
Snatch chains, wallets, bitches, fur coats
Tear the clubs up, all social events
If a nigga act tense put a hole in his fence
This ain't for fun but it's fun though
I gotta run though
Money ain't shit and watch me burn a few hundo
Tear the DeLucas down like the legend of Tone Starks
Tie bricks around his ankles, have him swimmin' with sharks
Dynamite they safe, lookin' for heirlooms
It's personal, I want the keys to the tombs
Kids college funds, crack the foundation
Connects to the banks and the police station
I want those faces rolled, truth behind the legend
Did it really go down, or it's just my obsession?

[Hook]
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Day dream of a Ruger to the Luger 'til the city is ours
Money, power, and the powder I would murder with y'all
In the name of King Kane "New York, New York!"
The city of dreams, stained sidewalks, and Mac 10s black as my fist
Search 'til it hurt, records from the wretched abyss
Murdered them, they scurred, wreck him 'til he wreckin' his shit
If he alludin' his life worth losin'
Kane said a record earned is a pot of gold
Prize a loan, put a marble floor in my momma home
Never need a loan, put the rest in the bank
We a army, only thing we missin' a tank
Couldn't harm me, keeper is my brother for the record
I'm a crazy muthafucka, blood stains on my knuckles
I'm a slugger, fist kill his brain
Load up a weapon in the name of King Lester Kane

[Hook]
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo
We crushed 'em, last spot left on the list
Crack the safe and peeled out twelve sealed discs
Lookin' illmatic, wrapped up in a robe
They were records, each one marked with a code
It said "Do Not Play" in big bold letters
The DeLucas pressed, stamped, engraved Vendettas
I think we hit it, ressurection of Ghostface
Shoulda known they had that shit hidden at Tone's place
Hit Logan, sip chilled Don Maretta
Big glasses of wine bringin' sharp chedda
Get the vinyl to headquarters, ASCAP codes
And tell Lester we hit the mother of all loads
Pagin' 911, meet back at the burghs
They gonna want revenge on the squad and all that space
We crippled 'em, but they go deeper than white meat
We got blood on our hands and war in the streets

[Hook]
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory
Get the money, we out here to pillage and loot
Crack safes, watch DeLucas' blood gettin' spilled
You can't take over the truth behind the story
Let Ghost legend live on in all its glory
