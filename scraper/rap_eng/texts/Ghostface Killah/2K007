[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
NBA 2K7
Word out
Ayy yo, yo

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayy yo my jump shot, crossover, slam, I break backboards
Even score, burn up them hardwood floors
Got them ear walls, guard number, stocks in my jersey
One man team, I swear the NBA so worthy
I could easily hall of fame, break all records
Alley-oop to myself for three points in last seconds
Win games 'cause P-Tone was raised on street ball
Throwin' it back to classics, a total recall
NBA 2K double-oh seven
I'm the James Bond of ball son, I run like the reverend
Sky hooks, fly game plans, shakin' off the best of 'em
Footwork so fast, you'd think y'all had debts in 'em

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Ayy yo it's dead, we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes
Yo it's dead we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes

[Verse 2: A.G.]
Me and Ghost is like Kobe and Shaq in '01
Me all love me 'cause I know Pun
Back to back like Shaq in '02
If she knew I knew Big L she'd probably bring the crew
It's a dream team nominee, MVP
I'm an east coast all-star in MP3's
And nothin' but legends be on my CD
We hold the title when it come to vinyl, D.I.T.C
A.G. --- hotter than iron ----, huh
I crossed him left, he went flyin' right
Keep it a hundred like Will, my mind is right
No rules, blacktops, Fab Five, black socks
Padlocks on the game, we own the key
Man to man, I penetrate, if you zone I three
It's the NBA 2K7 high roller
Once I hold a controller, 21 is over

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Ayy yo it's dead, we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes
Yo it's dead we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
You can bench me, I claim the most valuable position
And I move basketballs like a man on a mission
Best on Earth, best on Mars
You make a decision, I shoot from all around the court with precision
Look it's iron holdin' the Atlas
I just sleep on the offseasons Paul, 'cause I don't need practice
Got championship rings, a hook that stings
Watch me glide to the hoop like a bird with wings
Torch free throws, ayy, yo yo there's so ----
[?] the dress and your boy's a free agent
I'm ballin' in a velvet robe, eighty pounds of gold
And in my hands G, I'm dunkin' the globe

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Ayy yo it's dead, we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes
Yo it's dead we hit bullet
Numbers on the scoreboard
Teamwork, three hands on the ball like ---- boards
Crunch time, nailin' three points like punchlines
Ballin' out, stadium courts and slayin' rhymes

[Outro: Dan the Automator]
To me, Ghost is like holdin' it down in his own way
AG, a lot like AI, lil' man with a big crossover
And me? I'm kind of like Kidd or Nash, controllin' the floor
I'm from the Bay, I'm gonna have to say J. Rich, Baron Davis
