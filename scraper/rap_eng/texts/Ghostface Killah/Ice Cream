[Intro: Method Man]
Ma, Ma! Throw down some money!
The ice cream man is coming!

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins with a bunch of chickens how you're clicking
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love hon, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
God damn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
Back to you Maybeline Queen let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except C.R.E.A.M
So what you wanna do, what you wanna do
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Shaolin's finest, what up boo, peace your highness
Yo I'm lounging, big dick style y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making too fly jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good fly colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square dear
You better have C.R.E.A.M. to share, Ricans, ven aqui yeah

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like Thunder
Politic to your deficit step, gimme your number
Your sexy persuasive ta-ta's and thighs
Catch my eyes, like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time, Ice Cream you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh baby I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Chicks are at each other for the sting, who want the most of me
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you want to get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

[Pre-Hook: Method Man]
Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas, what?
It's the afterparty and bitches want to fuck

[Hook: Method Man]
Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is gettin touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And want their titties sucked, ice cream
Yeah...  your guts
French-vanilla, butter-pecan, chocolate-deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream

[Outro: Method Man]
One love to my chocolate deluxes, keep your nails done
And your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter-pecan Ricans for calling me Papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes, with the cherries on top
Yeah and big up to my French Vanillas
Parlez vous, francais, mi amor, merci, oui oui, bon bons
And all that good stuff, that good stuff
