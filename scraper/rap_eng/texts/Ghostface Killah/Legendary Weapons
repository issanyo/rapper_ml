[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
I flip goods like a stock trader (Get money!)
We gon' rush the floor, we attack like Al-Qaeda
Suicide missionary, black activist
Nice with the tongue, I'm a verbal type masochist
Tall body, my skin got Teflon fibers
Dodge bullets, rock chains the size of barbed wires
Rolled Big Pun, a whole ounce of reefer
Rock that black and yellow before Wiz Khalifa
It's a Killah- B color scheme
I blow mega cream
Been Ghostface before Scream, know what I mean?
Like Billie Jean, lighting up the floor when I walk
This is Staten Island, New York
'87 Cheeba Hawk
No pork, no swine on the rider
If your chick loose or tighter, I'mma still get inside her
Rebel porn star, thick like dick swelling then
Beat the pussy up, leave it soft like gelatin

[Chorus]
(What the hell is going on here?)
(M-m-m-man I'm not playing, I kick the rough shit)
(Say what?)
(I--I-I-I'm n-n-not playing)
(Direct from the Shaolin Slum, here I come)
(Right now I'm teaching school)
(There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes)
(You don't wanna get too close to that man, you about to get cut up)

[Verse 2: AZ]
You know the MO, could never be in limbo
No lie, I rather die ‘fore I cough up info
Boss shit, intro, horse dick, nympho
Smooth on the chicks like a Robin Thicke Tempo
In-point flow, make your bottom bitch En Vogue
Soft cushion insoles stroll on tracks
In the back of the car when they told on Plat
Plaques on plaques, got racks on racks
So no need to ask why he act "All That"
King Congac got a thing for them Gats
A Hades offspring, I'm a fiend for them facts
Swing on the map, overseas with the G's
South Cackalack trying to squeeze me some cheese
Pleased on the d's when they telled on the pipe
Around the same time I excelled on the mic
The name "AZ" rings bells on site

[Chorus]
(What the hell is going on here?)
(M-m-m-man I'm not playing, I kick the rough shit)
(I offer you reality!)
(Direct from the Shaolin Slum, here I come)
(Right now I'm teaching school)
(There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes)
(You don't wanna get too close to that man, you about to get cut up)

[Verse 3: Lil Fame/Billy Danze]
I take money like a pool shark, put the eighth in my right pocket
Hella-cool dude and I won't hesitate to pop it
Still a rude dude, try to replicate my doctrine
Roll with mad killers, my niggas regulate the projects
I'm hard body, I keep it John Gotti
You keep it Bon Jovi, you wear thongs probably
Nigga you fucking with a sick puppy
We fill up in this bitch, it's about to get ugly
I could tell you I’m hood, but ya'll should already know
My affiliation of wolves could trip you to the globe
I'm worlwide with it for sure
You better check or get laced up from the face up and left off
We don't just do it, we do it to death
Pay some respect, some shit will go real when you rap
The realness, we spit this, Killah B Kill
Shit I still Killah B Kill, should of never concealed it

[Chorus]
(What the hell is going on here?)
(M-m-m-man I'm not playing, I kick the rough shit)
(Say what?)
(I--I-I-I'm n-n-not playing)
(Direct from the Shaolin Slum, here I come)
(Right now I'm teaching school)
(There it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes)
(You don't wanna get too close to that man, you about to get cut up)
