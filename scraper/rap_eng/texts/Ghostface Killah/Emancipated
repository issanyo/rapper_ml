[Intro]
Yeah, uhuh
Just right, uhuh
Fix this shit
One, two, yo, yo

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I'ma bring it to your door like sure enough
Little niggas can't stop the rush
You would think my gun just like bottled up
Beer in the freezer the way the fold busts
Red hoodies, Yves Saint Laurent on my nosebone
Make sure there's digital lights up on my tombstone
Suited out with SWAT teams, AR-15s
With manpower that'll kill your ghosts and your big dreams, shit
Y'all know how I do this for a livin'
Throw your head in the turkey fry on Thanksgiving
It's me, the G-H to the O-S-T
With more cocoa to nut 'til I'm better than Nestl√©
Strip search your reverend, hit 'im up next week
You don't give me everything in the plate, you gon' weep
See two killers far left, the land's too ceased
The thin one got the same shaped head as Bruce Lee
And both of them niggas is wearing Coogi

[Interlude]
Who wanna size me up?
I got a 40 cal. chillin' right beside my nuts
Shit is real hardcore
All my people from the front to the back hear

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, ninety pound pitts, lockjaw on your femur
Kamikaze, I bomb like Hiroshima
You a lemur, I'mma get that monkey ass mutilated
Arrest the president, we emancipated
You gold plated niggas can't fuck with the solid gold
That Wonderland shit got you stuck in the foxhole
I rock slow, push the four fifth down your tonsils
Fucking with the murderous clique that get hostile
Coke in the nostrils, bottles of Beluga
We movin' that weight from here to Chattanooga
Ruger, dress Prince down with a semi
Bulletproof glass, the trucks is double hemi
With more horsepower than Raceway Park
Fuck a spark, I'mma blaze like light in the dark
Move like a shark in shallow water, verbal slaughter
I hang that nigga Trump head south of the border
