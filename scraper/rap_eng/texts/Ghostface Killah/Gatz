[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, come on duke, pass that shit, man (I just got this)
Come on man, what the fuck you mean you just got it man?
You doggin' that shit, Ricky Steamboat ass muthafucka
Yo, lemme get that booze, pass me that booze, for him
Aiyo, Kay Slay, drop that shit, baby

[Wigs]
This ain't your biggest score, son, this is verbal war
Too much endurance, you never had a chance on tour
Watch me perform, I say some marvelous shit
I got the whole crowd screamin' like "Yeah, that's it"
I'm mack-a-docious, guerilla in the hood, when I wrote this
You know The Source gon' give me a few mics and quote this
No average white boy, my style's too ferocious
Puff trees on the block and I've slept with the toasters
Dug out Janet, jacked off on the posters
Sold explosives, bottle rockets by the grosses
First taste of big money, now I need double doses
Don't need no features, we got Ghost to host us
Theodore Unit, we the new Sammy Sosa's
Guns too big, they won't fit in the holsters
And we sittin' on top of the world, killin' ya'll roaches

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Staten Island got gats, the West got gats
The Jungle got gats, the Killah got gats
The New got gats, the Town got gats
Niggas gon' bust back, come on, what
Medina got gats, Mecca got gats
P-Long got gats, The Desert got gats
Jersey got gats, niggas gon' bust gats
Niggas gon' bust back, fuck it, come on

[Solomon Childs]
A powerful imprint of crimes, Hall of Fame
Not only a killer, but a mastermind
From the Hall of Fame, screamin', who deliver the impact
To strike like the lights in the yard up north
(Get 'em) Music for them entrepreneurs
Who made it with the ki's of coke
All the way back to New York, New York
Fed magazine, they don't wanna come to my hood
They don't want the interview, lyrically able to pen a few
Shit, It'd take a million of you, to hold me back
I'm learnin' how to live lavish, triple digits
I'm learnin how to move past it (get 'em)
I'm learnin how to clean my ratchets
Fuckin' with the Theodore Unit, is drastic
Blizzies, half metal, half plastic

[Chorus]
