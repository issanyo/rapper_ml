[Intro: Wiki]
Yep
What’s good
Been all around the world and back baby
We home
Shout out Gill
Mario come on let me get that bacon egg and cheese right quick
Look

[Verse 1: Wiki]
I flip it today’s paper
Cadence making deli life entertainment
Acquainted with
Old heads miscellaneous
Motherfuckers ain’t gon’ drift
They stay put, they ain’t gon’ miss
At least not every shot that they took
Y’all look not a day past six
I aged like six years in the last ten days I lived
Cats trying to say I’m sick, I am
The game ain’t been the same the way I spit, y’all can’t
Y’all can’t checkmate the kid
I got a check that say I’m lit
I gotta cash that
Turn it to a fat sack, face that shit
It’s basic, I’m made for this
I'm made for this

[Hook: Wiki]
Beef and Brocs we made for this
Leave the spot bathed and kissed
By angels we made for this
Hip Hop we made of this
I don’t want to have to say this shit
Again we made for this
Trying to hate on the kid what he did?
Bring it on man we made for this
Whether we taking trips or we staying in
Man we made for this

[Verse 2: Wiki]
Room messy I get paid to kick
If you don’t get me you ain’t made for this
Not concerned if my clothes piled up
Cause if my dough pile up I’ll get a maid for this
I’m patient shit
Bitch in the back like
Please don’t get that black light so you can see the stains I left
Don’t worry mami half them stains is mine
Don’t stress we had an amazing time
You trying rest you can stay the night
But when I wake gotta make a flight
I’m out
I couldn’t count the amount of days I stayed in my house
But now it's show night goes wrong goes right
I been gone so long alright
Slow down supposed to be the pro type
Tuck in my gold type kid
I ain't gotta show off shit
Shows go off, bars come off my soul
And they waft up on all y’all’s thoughts
Head look like
It’s goin’ explode when i’m charged, but I get those off
The bars
It was planes, that’s the thing now we back so its trains and metro cards
Made for this
Heard you're acquainted with some of these kids, but you ain't met the god

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I was made for this my bones is titanium
Thoughts that marinate I swear through the cranium
The Porsche is flossless I’m live like 5 bosses
I’m warning each and one of ya’ll niggas, be cautious
Shit is serious, no Eddie Murphy Delirious
No Da Vinci Codes, death comes from being curious
I ain’t playin son, rap is detrimental
Knowledge is power, let loose on the instrumental
Made for bitches, made for the money too
Made for the Wu Tang Clan, we comin’ through
Close my eyes, and I still can’t go to sleep
Fox News got these wolves dressed as sheep
You can’t trick a tricknologist, smooth criminologist
Me and Shallah Reakwon, go head and follow us
We Prophets, profitable, no question to this
You can look me dead in my eyes, I was made for this

[Hook: Wiki]
Beef and Brocs we made for this
Leave the spot bathed and kissed
By angels we made for this
Hip Hop we made of this
I don’t want to have to say this shit
Again we made for this
Trying to hate on the kid what he did?
Bring it on man we made for this
Whether we taking trips or we staying in
Man we made for this

[Outro: Wiki]
It was planes, that’s the thing
Now we back so it's trains and metro cards
Made for this
Heard you're acquainted with some of these kids
But you ain't met the god
