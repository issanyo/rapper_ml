[Verse]
From the righteous mind of Allah, he powers my soul
Teaching me positivity in the whole
How to walk amongst the evil and smile in the face of death
To speak knowledge and wisdom 'til my last breath
I'm a humble brother, got love for another
Body heaters wouldn't keep you warm under the covers
Make peace not war, make babies some more
Keep a smile when you travel from shore to shore
Superficial, don't get sucked into the scene
The grass ain't always green, the meat ain't always lean
Make sure it's halal, no pork on the fork
No swine in the cupcake, feeling we know it's pork
Keep your Qu'ran handy, keep it close to your heart
See the dumbest fall from smart
I spark a light in the dark
Follow me, I'ma pray 'til the sun shines over me
Pray 'til the righteous ways is taking over me
