[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage
In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I ain't letting nothing live, horrific the ghost risen
Stigmata scenery ill visions of being villains
The taste of blood is left on my tongue
Walk through the valley of death
I see the reaper waiting with two snakes kissing
Can't believe they took my wife and my kids, and straight lynched 'em
Word to God, once I get 'em, I got 'em, the moments priceless
Decapitating heads like a journalist snatched with Isis
I want revenge now!
Spotted one of Delucas men, at a restaurant
Eating spaghetti, drinking on Dom PÃ©rignon
With two other goons laughing, probably joking bout the murder
I calmly approach them with the burner
When they realized the real live G was about to serve 'em
60 pieces blew through his jaw, closing his curtains
Now it's total chaos, the people running for they lives
The other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
But they was slow on their draw so I blammed 'em
Taking they tops off like a convertible drop burgundy phantom
They say the taste of revenge is sweet, well let me see
Prepare the table for a feast, take a seat, now let's eat

[Hook]
In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage
In the beginning, it's time for a new chapter
Twelve more reasons to die, after the laughter
It's relevant, the legacy lives on lavish
Ghostface Killah, return of the savage

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Beast mode, I'm resurrected, I hear the record spinning
Early 70s, New York Kingpins
And I see street life, the only life I know
I see Liberty, I see the motherfucking Verrazano
I see gangstas getting money, bitches acting funny
Stacks upon stacks, and not one nigga bummy
Something ain't right, these ain't the greedy streets of Italy
Where Logan and my seed? C'mon son, you kidding me?
Who's calling me? Who's looking for the killer with no face?
Who summoned me into this place? I need answers!
Behave chancellors, I'm a vigilante killer
No time for games and there ain't no nigga realer
Let's talk business, you don't wanna leak your own blood
State your name, before you get stretched like a rug!
