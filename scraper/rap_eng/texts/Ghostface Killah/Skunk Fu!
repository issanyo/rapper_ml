[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo
Skunk Fu, balancing the earths and the heavens
With an old wise panda and a whole pack of bredrins
Rabbit, fox, pig, snake and killer bees
Duck, crane, tiger fighting off ninja monkeys
And baboon, that evil dragon won't prevail
Over young skunk skills and that old stink-tail
Defender of the valley from the dragon in the lake
Use your mind, body and soul to fly as you levitate
The Yin, the Yang, the shadowboxing technique
Then monkey flip, tiger-style train of defeat
Disappear with the teleportation in the trees
This is kung fu mastered by infinite degrees
With an army of the animals created by God
Supernatural, believe in the sun, moon and stars
Lead the resistance, not just do as they thinkers
If you smell something funny, that Skunk's letting off stinkers

[Chorus: Shawn Wiggs]
Skunk Fu! Rocking that Fu Manchu
Learning how to defend like the rest of his crew
Slap a ninja monkey, learn all types of techniques
Swing that old stink-tail and watch how it reeks

[Verse 2: Cilvaringz]
Yo Ghost, welcome to the Spartan war room
Where the killer bees sleep till it's time for the swarming
We skirmish, skunk's like the monks
Of the Shaolin temple who fight, never run
It's fire, water, stone rocks and earth
Five elements deep like the ox and the bird (you heard)
Banana swing, flame swords and darts
But make sure the kid stay good in the heart
And if by any chance things get adrift
(Surprise!) Dropped at the whiff
Of a stink, I'm fighting, six ninja monkeys is easy
Ask the fox if you do not believe me
Defeat me? You wilding, resistance
We fight old baboon and the dragon, so listen
To master, the panda, his grammar is kung fu and tongue fu
The way he swing daggers? He loves you

[Chorus]
