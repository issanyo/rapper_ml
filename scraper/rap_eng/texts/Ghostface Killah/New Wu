[Intro: Raekwon]
Uh-huh, what up, son? Yeah
Maintaining, maintaining, you know?
You good, right? Everything proper, still, right?
Of course, come on, man, what's the matter with you, man?
Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on

[Hook: Method Man]
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You know how to dress a lad, get rocked
Hundred bags, black doorags, ski masks is on, g-rags
Don't try to take pictures, relax, still in the grass
You'll learn respect, burst when I ask
Rhyme master busy Rizzy on the subject
Love Deck, thug buried, drug vest, snub sets, iller than most
Night time toast, gorillas in boats, three votes
Realers is killa, gangsta feel notes
Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information
Vivid vacation, deliberation moments
Move like '91 Romans, cloning everything
Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome
Maxed out, Amex style, my team brand bandits
Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby
Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit
Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it

[Hook: Method Man]
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill
They call us Bin Ladens, laughing, turbaned up
Faggot niggas get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef
So watch how the kid turn it up
Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering and busters
Eighteen niggas is bringing the ruckus
Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work
The trey eight'll blow one of your dojas
When theres mad heat, he the mad calm, walk around
Gold collect, 36, so before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered Qi-Gong
Ya'll Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong
Forensic file, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bals
Laying niggas like ceramic tile
I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile
Kneeing niggas in the nuts, nigga, damn I'm foul

[Hook: Method Man]
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu

[Verse 3: Method Man]
We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things
Look for me, grams in my pocket, Chef cook for me
Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble
I'm a good dude, don't short change me, seen as a hood rule
Beer drinking, Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct
This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock
Then let these niggas go off top
We rock fitted, dropkick it, I lived it and not quit it
I pithed it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished
I'm *burns himself* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken
I'm shitting the Glock, spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching
Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing
And two divas wit they tops missing
Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be
But I don't want my children to be

[Hook: Method Man]
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a Soo!
Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in
All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin
Here we go, yo, ya'll already know what it do
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu
