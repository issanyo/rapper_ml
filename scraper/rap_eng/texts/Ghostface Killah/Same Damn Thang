[Verse 1]
You are the real one
You know, everything we thinking about is good
But like when all the goodness comes outta you man
You only got one alternative, man
That’s to turn around and look at each other
I can’t look at the man sitting up in the office
Cause I’m down in the south Bronx
But I do have somebody man and I look up to him
And that’s how we save each other (save each other)
[?? Forward to forests in South Sudan]
But shorties love stuntin’ the [?]
On the acid tabs and denim [?] South Park (juice clans)
Rubble kings in this concrete kingdom
Fifteen with the killers, Mystique and the chic villain
Covested warrior, baby face but his heart devoid of
All remorse of days of Genocidal Holocaust
Can’t tangle loose of the grips of this fixed system
Twisted guns on ourselves cause we mixed in misvision
Chapelle and angel dust
Tore my halo and devil horns
Scorned by this country’s swords
Since the day I was first born
These politicians lining their pockets with our blood
Snub our mommas cries to call us rebels and thugs
Chaotic outlaws and battling the trap
Don’t raffle shit with my pack
Strikes on my back and now I can’t turn back
The same song echoes through project halls
Amid the [?] in Senegal
The Compton in Chirac
Where killers crawl - where killers crawl
Where killers crawl - where killers crawl

[Hook]
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island
Wilding, riding on the train
Same, the same damn thang
Same damn thang that you see today
Detroit, L.A., B’More, Houston
Trooping, shooting
It’s the same, it’s the same damn thang
Same damn thang
Same damn thang and it’s a shame

[Verse 2]
He didn’t know that Hershey kiss
Was an ‘X’ fax
The ‘OG’ push woo woo is the extract
Stuffed in fly jeans, it’s tough
Middle o’ the lane
Supported by live grains it’s rough
The Mink, the collars
Snow White rubbing my earlobe
In the caves of Guyana
I’m wearing that rare gold
Pardon me, I’m here for the life
I’m a OD, I’m killing this nigga
Like [? Lynn Bayer]
Drop his head in the turkey fire
Fry this niga real quick in his whole attire
Finish, back to the trap house
Filet mignons is being flipped
Getting down on the black couch
The low budge’ low go flex we into
Serial killer who axe swings like a pendulum (yeah)
We come together like bible study
The plot, the plan, the conquer
Just to get money - just to get money
Just to get money - just to get money
Just to get money

[Hook0]
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island
Wilding, riding on the train
Same, the same damn thang
Same damn thang that you see today
Detroit, L.A., B’More, Houston
Trooping, shooting
It’s the same, it’s the same damn thang
Same damn thang
Same damn thang and it’s a shame

[Verse 3]
And it’s the same damn thing
Same damn scene
Same soldier from the field
In the same fatigue
With the same M16
Same cup, red here sipping Lean
Out the same canteen
With the same regime
Dirty by now niggas can’t stay clean
Keys coming from overseas
Ships straight from Beijing
Smoking weed, selling ‘Yay’ to the feds
Living life the high speed
While I’m chasing this cheese
Put in one for the team, my youngest sixteen
He was carried home from the bench
Screaming with the med IA
With felonious dreams
Can’t let any and everything
Four pair 23’s and the eight of the green
He let any green involved in the entasy ring
Ran from Detroit to Shreveport
L.A. to Queens
From B/More to E. Quest
Philly to Palm Springs
[?] Savannah back to Tampa
S&S to the grid
They wanna hear my long J
But not this too far, fall between
In Detroit, city of kings

[Hook]
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island
Wilding, riding on the train
Same, the same damn thang
Same damn thang that you see today
Detroit, L.A., B’More, Houston        Trooping, shooting
It’s the same, it’s the same damn thang
Same damn thang
Same damn thang and it’s a shame
