[Verse 1]
I formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slipping
I'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position
Bitches are sneaky, trifling and not to be trusted
A weak link in the team and the chain will get busted
Don't trust her, love is for suckers
Too many enemies is out there son, tryna bring the ruckus
Keep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade
Keep doing what we're doing, getting money and getting paid

[Verse 2]
It's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it
Fuck the past, let's put the present in perspective
That's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me
Stand butt-naked in the storm, sipping the frosty
You force me to choose, I'ma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart
No more DeLucas, straight Killa Bee on the Swarm
And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on
