(Yeah, Yeah)
Tony Starks ya'll
Ghost, Bini and Case
C'mon, yeah
Sing that sh*t
Let'em have it

(Case)
Been around the world ladies come and go
Still I tell myself that you weren't one of those
That's what I get for being polite
I'm not upset or headed goodbye

Tried to love you tried to please you
It never made a difference I see
Shoulda known betta
I feel so dumb
Made you the one
It never made a difference I see
Shoulda known betta

Such a perfect love or so I thought it was
But you were lovin' you, girl instead of lovin' us
That's what I get for being polite
I'm not upset

Girl, I can't believe how much I really loved you
And I really don't believe how much I cared

So I guess I made a fool out of myself
But believe me, it won't happen again

(Ghostface Killah)
Your part of me son, yo let me jump in Case
We do the same sh*t girl watcha talkin' about dog
Stopped this young thief from eatin' pork
Now she on the phone hollerin', you want child support
Too bad I ain't got no cream and the kids they go and get it
'cause as soon as she get it, she go and spend it
And that's what I get just for lovin' her more
Got me feeling like a stranger when I walk in the door
Lookin' at me like it's my fault, (word)
With devious thoughts in the back of her head
Wishin' the kids were on morphine
Get laid off or get sprayed off lose my face
But I refuse like a plane I'm a take off
Induce my career now that I'm alone I
Think without stress for the moment Case
Y'know I'm a
When I love I love too hard
