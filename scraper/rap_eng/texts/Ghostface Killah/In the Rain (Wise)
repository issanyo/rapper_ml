[Ghostface Killah]
I think it happened on a Saturday
I heard the phone ring
Vling, vling, vling, vling, vling
Who this? Ron?
Yo, Wise got killed last night by the tracks
It was the same Ohio niggas teamed up
Sent 'em back, we shoulda drilled a long time ago
We went disaccordin, now we owe
The devil slid through, without an intro
Yo Ron, it can't be!
Wise guest-starring me!!
Can it be, we both got hit
God legendary!
He a General, he survived Adolf
Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs
He stated his word
And he solemnly sweared to tell the truth
That his bond was like pure addict, pure roof
Wise God Allah, warrior
XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne
Touched something for ya
Ya Steubenville niggas fucked up
Because bitches is talking
They live at, I'm twisting your alley back
You killed my man
You killed my man and you sent him back
After this day, watch your head
Slugs flying everywhere
You smell havoc in the air
You can never get the god emphatically
Now Cipher
You've been vibin' off the same battery
We had, back in '91 that got you hyper
God been beautiful, god been great
God fed you, you'd die if he survived that take
You killed your king
Rakeem Allah gave him his light
He was your offspring
Camouflaged all day with green
One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil
Yo, that's my fam, he snatch me out of big head van
We taught you how to get game, from sayin' "peace god"
Islamic translates Allah's tounge, spit the language art
Alex Haley thoughts, identical twin
My A-Alike gasmate, the hay grows
The days close, hide your lobe!

[The Dramatics]
Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone..
I know I'm gonna see, a better day
I know I think I'm crying, becouse of you
I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry
Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise!

***Chorus (x3)***
I wanna go outside, in the rain...
It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside, in the rain...
