[Intro: Raekwon]
Fly, fly, up against the wall stand off, Killah
We here, we here, nigga, you see us
You see us nigga, flyin' through your city
In the mean shit, word up, just analyze it nigga
Yeah, realizin' the world

[Hook 2X: Raekwon]
My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, aiyo Rae, check out the bangle (uh-huh)
Where niggas brought to an angle
Look how it shine, arm is like thank you

[Raekwon]
Yo, pa, yo I already peeped that
But did you peep the cream of wheat
Oatmeal seats that hugs you like bean bags?

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, he had ads in the Staten Island ad
He bought a Benz, a Bentley, his promotion was the best
In Queens, throughout, all coliseums, right
Mint condominiums, bitches, premium shittin' on millennium
He was a master when he bought Henny
And, good at plaster and he taught many
Thinkin' like fuck bitches, can't stop me now
I'm legal, like the feds can't knock me now
Shoulders is cocked d., plus he his donuts where the cops be
His bitch on the M.C. tip, is Foxy
Chop shops is where his pops be
Blow his money on hoes, plus he O.G
And he quick to paparazzi

[Raekwon]
His sweaters is the steel version, cut the commercialism
Go hard, jumpin' out of Saabs, writin' ill verses
Represent towns and vallies, all rallies and ballies
Rolled down, blowin' Cali weed
The Hennessey pourin, remixin' it with Crown
When egotistic get down, the hundred wolves in woolie coats
Niggas throats is heavy, he's used to wearin' ropes
Sailin' in boats, the goats let me live and standin' loyal like the kid 70
I'm ancient, zippers is made of gold, I prevail well
Who be rockin' them steel wells
Yo, it's us, a hundred busters, three hundred barrels of dust
Lustin' discussions, the world will remember us
Catch me poppin' sweats and Timbs, with gats, iller brims
Take ups is matchin' all gold ratchet
A hundred villains, billion assets
Smashed up my last jet, blood on my jumper, flood it with gas wet
Catch me poppin' sweats and Timbs, with gats, iller brims
Take ups is matchin' all gold ratchet
A hundred villains, billion assets
Smashed up my last jet, blood on my jumper, flood it with gas wet
