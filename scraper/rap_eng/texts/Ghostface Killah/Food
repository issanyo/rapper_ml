[Verse 1]
I used to rob and steal, now I make food for thought
Fresh like the air you snort
I drop jewels, little nuggets of wisdom
Seeds that keep growing
Paying my debts to society, so no more owing
Now it's showing and proving, keep the body moving
Exercising the mind is scientifically proven
To increase your life line, strengthen your heart
Eat fish, that brain food will get you smart
Yoga, deep meditational tactics
You no good then just practice, cause practice makes perfect
Stop burying your lies and bring the truth to the surface
Money is the root to all evil, that cash rule
Will have you out there looking like a damn fool
That's the devil's bait, the all mighty dollar tree
Will have your mind fooled by tricknology
Make the right choice, no need for an apology

[Verse 2]
Them light is the Sun, the Sun's the Father
The Father is the man on Earth, we try harder
To teach one, preach one, just acknowledge the wisdom
Can't figure right from wrong, it's a tough decision
My vision is light, some come to me when yours black out
Follow the footprints as I lay the tracks out
He's a righteous God, I want the best for mankind
Navigate through this war without blowing a landmine
My light shines from the east my brother
Verbally I spit, I'm a beast my brother
March through the blackness, search for the ray of lights
Don't walk bare footed through the grass 'cause that's where the snake strikes
Protect ya neck, evil lurks in the shadows
Darkness is best where the Devil wins battles
The weak fall victim, the strong sound diligent
Guerilla, we gully but manage to stay militant
Super stars, our ego is so top billing it
Follow me son and I'll show you how I'm killing it
These wolves is vicious, assigned to danger
The changer, I'm 'bout to pull you all through a chamber
