[Verse 1: Kendace Springs]
Never wanted to get left alone
I didn't know how to go along without you
Is it too late?
Did I make a mistake?
Think about the times we shared
Through the good and bad. Don't feel so sad
Is it too late?
Did I make a mistake?

[Hook]
Yeah yeah, did I make a mistake?
No no, is it too late?
Oh oh, did I make a mistake?
Yeah, yeah, uh
