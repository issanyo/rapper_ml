Intro:
I can't fall down on my knees
(i thought you loved me)
(if you really loved me you would have stayed with me)
And apologize to you
(and apologized to me thats all i'm askin)
But that ain't my style
(well let me hear wat you had to say earlier)

Verse 1:
I remember how me met
It was on the train
How could i forget
You smiled when you looked at me
The soft of your lips that captured me
The whole ride down
We kept our eyes on each other
And then me sat, down together
You gave me your number
Said 'give me a call'
I thought i wouldn't call at all...
But here we are
Fell in love
Like hand to glove
Pure bliss from above
Now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
We never seem to get it right
See there's too much fire so much desire
So i took a little pill to take me higher
I'm sorry if i hurt you when i ran astray
I guess i got caught in the day- heyey

Chorus
I can't fall down on my knees
And apologize to you
It not in my style (x2)

Verse 2:
I remember the night
When we were all alone
You were on the sofa
I was on the phone
You over heard me call out my best friends name
Thats when you went crazy
Started going insane
Grabbed the phone from my hand
Backed me against the wall
Shouting and askin 'who was on the call?'
You would believe me
When i said it was just a friend
Thats when all the madness began

You kept yellin while i stuck to the floor
Cryin all these tears, i can't cry them no more
I knew you had a temper
I wish i didn't see it
You wanted me to be faithful
I said i could be it
But that didn't stop you
From puttin your hands on my face
You said you simply had to 'put me into my place'
At the end of every tunnel
Theres always a light
And the door will show whose right

Chorus:
I can't fall down on my knees
And apologize to you
Cause it not in my style (x2)

Hook:
He's got you begging on your knees
Crying in you sleep
Making you believe him
But you're stronger
Then you'll ever know girl
You control your own world
No need to take no more! (x2)

Verse 4:(Rap)
Hey yo yo yo
I asked you to calm down
Asked you who was on the phone
Put the horn down
Had a glass of wine
From a 99 yeah a green one
Which i bought for you from the cruise you won
I dun approve of those male friends
I told you back then when we first got together
That i don't trust those men
And you did it again
I lost my temper
Blinked out and wrecked the house boo
Thats all i remember i'm sorry (sorry Sorry)

Chorus:
I can't fall down on my knees
And apologize to you
Cause that not in my style(x4)
