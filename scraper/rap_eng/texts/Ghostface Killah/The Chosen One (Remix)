[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Mm mm mm, look at you, still look the same after all these years
Baby you ain't never changed, that's what I'm trying to tell you
Sun shining, you looking all good standing up there
Toes look, you know how I do ma, I lick my shits all day
You know what I mean? Word up I'm a don, sweet I chose you
Jaheim gon tell you

[Ghostface Killah]
Ayo your smile is a hundred thou
The crystal balls on your earlobe make Oprah throw in the towel
Your eyes are power, your breathe smells like vanilla spice
Running off with grandma's yams, we held hands at Summer Jams, and watch
Jamie Foxx, around the fifth song's when I gave you the rock
Your ass was in shock, you kissed me, grabbed me held meb efore I popped
The questionm you said yes right on the spot
We moved to North ?Cack?, though the house is large
Seated up where your breasts can't fit in your bra
And if you can't do the natural, don't worry, take a c-section, I rub
Coco butter all
Over your scars
And I have a lil somethin somethin to lay me out
I promise I won't let it hit the baby's scalp
And pork yo can ever enter into the baby's mouth
Stop wobbling baby and sit your ass on the couch
Come here

[Chorus: Jaheim (Sample)]
Oooooh (I coose you baby)

[Interlude: Ghostface Killah (Jaheim)]
Ayo Ja yeah, tell em daddy

[Jaheim]
I can push that whip off the showcase floor
Into these strings and the headrest store
Something a little more mature
Preparing for the future, ut it down on something with a fence, or even a door
All the jewelry stores, a pinky ring or a ring for her
Show her something I adore, what could be better
Save it for myself, or for my baby
All the kisses I can give, and people I can see
The onl one for me, the decision is easy to make, I choose you girl
Over everything

[Interlude: Jaheim singing wtih Ghostface & Talib Kweli talking]

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, I'm so glad I chose you to hold, not wifey
I'm so glad you chose me  just like that Ronald Isley (word)
Met you at the Jaheim show, like what the deal?
I usually don't fuck with R&B but yo I keep it real
I love the way you walk and talk as heavenly ghetto
Sneakers or stelletos, if it's beef, I'm ready with metal
The way that you pull my strings is very Gepetto
You say that I'm not a real ill than I'm ready to settle
Your beauty is the subject that I love to speak on
I love every body part, from the toe to the cheekbone
On the bed, she scream harder than the beast mode
Freaking off like we grown, somebody better turn the heat on
The way my love got me walking through flames for you
I aim and I beg for you, I change and remain loyal
Ain't ashamed to give you my name cus I adore you
My earth, I plant the seeds, we come from the same soil

[Chorus w/ Jaheim singing in background]
