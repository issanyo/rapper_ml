[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Cream- five- five- five stars- cream up in the
Rock- rock- rockstars

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
If I had it my way, I would sing all day
And never say a word to you
If I had it my way, I would laugh all night
And never feel a shade of blue
If I had it my way, I would be fine
Wouldn't be thinking all the time
I could just do, mhm, whatever I want to, mhm
I would be free to do whatever I want to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo, if I had it my way, the high way
Supreme Clientele, 365 days in the telly
Five stars, rockstars, laughing with Dirt
Me and Osiris, son, putting in work
Mornings in the mosh, afternoons at the juice bar
Bentley coup√©, Maybach, haters, I rebuke y'all
Little who call, cigar may be a pre-roll
Fake room service knocking at the door, they wanted Migos
If my way, I would play the Reverend Al Green
With Super Fly playing on a 90 inch screen
Every chain would have rocks the size of gumballs
And my house would have Basquiats hung on the walls
My way like Sinatra, little butter on the matzah
Nothing but cream up in the crib, I mean lots of
Rubber bands stack, private securities
Smelting down gold, 24K for the purity

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
If I had it my way, every day would feel like Friday
No cell phones would vibrate
Clutch on this SM58, everything moving at my pace
Focus on the path that I pave for myself
I ain't worry 'bout no-one else
Nothing but a vision in my lane
All BFFs in MySpace, all VVS, my top eight
Free (Bitch) to do what I want to

[Bridge: Jesse Rutherford & Ghostface Killah]
Hey, hey (Rock- rockstars)
Hey

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
If I had it my way, I would sing all day
And never say a word to you
If I had it my way, I would laugh all night
And never feel a shade of blue
If I had it my way, I would be fine
Wouldn't be thinking all the time
I could just do, mhm, whatever I want to, mhm
I would be free to do whatever I want to

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
Free like birds
I wanna be free like birds
Free like birds
Tryna be free like birds
