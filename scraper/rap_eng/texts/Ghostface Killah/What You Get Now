[Intro:]
(Instrumentals)
Ha ha ha
Grind over matter
Yo it's all about snow goons
[horn blowing]
Ayo ayo whats up this is sean stubs
I got ma mans Aspects and Coyote
They'll let you know what it is
We going in on shit
We about to burn it down ya'll hear the voice scratching

[Verse 1:]
Yo i'm unstable i'm fatal just read the label
Got a lot just like a just like a j i'm on point
Like a scare ferocious the flow is [?] overdosing
I'm dosing something is potent
Like when i'm smoking rolling like a locomotive
If fear is loading got me flying like Boeings
And getting paid is the motive
And it's sold in the slogan they say
Cash rules everything, everything and anything
Packi died hit the red beam with a steady aim
I'm getting head like decapitation ma [?] amazing
Ma lust for guns got me fascinated i'm captivated
I'm mad rich i'm ambitious so vicious with it
And bad bitches they ass kissing to get with this shit
I keeps it moving i'm fluent but what i'm doing
Truth is we never lose you can't fuck with the movement
So just take on or just get down yo body might not get found
You see it then your stake is what you see is what you get now

[Chorus:]
What you see is what you get now
Get down or just paid
Get maid or just get laid
Hustle hustle everyday
What you see is what you get now
Get down or just get killed
Get still or just get real
Hustle get them dollar bills

[Verse 2:]
Ayo ma arms got a similar aim as james bond
Every boss have got her, one bad blonde
Flying down slowes in the Auston
[?] split them two hundred dollar bills in the napkin
Lusting over guns big house on the beach front
Slick Rick's mouth dirty diamonds on east front
Uh ma squads very articulate
We order those sackies at the bar burn a wicked spliff
This ain't a myth metropolitan acknowledging
I get pussy like a gynecologist been on [?]
Rumour has it ma jewelry is magic and rubies flashing
I sound so clear I should be digitally remastered
Tone I stay red down like valentine
Rest ma head in the palace out in palestine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I banged a bitch like 80 times in ma 85
Cause I'm a ladies guy all the bitches pay to ride
You gotta pay to play nowadays hustle hustle everyday
Yea I been around the way made my way from A-Z
Now i'm back up on the track I keep moving like crack
I ball atomically I drop it on them like Iraq
[?] the devil doubled all of his struggles
I hustle in the jungle with bottles and all I see is trouble
I keep it moving  not losing I do what I do
Original aboriginal indigenous crew
I got ma [?] split them like and Auto bot
Decepticons running don't spots where the ladder at
They moving slow like an avalanche pimping in the cadalac
Stomping on the block homie just like the battle act
What you see is what you get well you just get got
So get yo dollar dollar bills homie go get lots

[Chorus]
