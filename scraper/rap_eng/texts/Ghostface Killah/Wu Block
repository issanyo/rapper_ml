Wu Block, Wu Block, Wu Block..

[Verse 1 - Sheikh]
Sitting at the table legs crossed: I'm bossy
High top Louis' chain on em: I'm flossy
Mommy Hermes bag - her lips is glossy
Dondon shades on dark as coffee
They coming through staring, I'm like "bitch get off me!"
Hater get off me, police get off me
We're sending the hood, deal with it, I been gone
The money been flowing for months, I've been tourin
I buy a new whip every time it gets boring
Motorcycle pipes: I'm coming through roaring
I'm fucking this money every day: no Trojan
Donnie G Bobby B. Ghost is holdin

Wu Block, Wu Block, Wu Block..

[Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah]
Who's the kid with the gorgeous neck Who hit Mega?
Lion heads laying on them Bill Cosby sweaters
The eyes it Rubed out, the nose is glass
Put your ear to my waves you can hear the splash
Me and Sheek we don't buy the bar, we do dips on it
The cardiovascular boys get whipped on it
Head cracked, red dice roll triple sixes
Flustered out, eyeballs low in the trenches
Besides hoes, I ain't fly clothes in the kitchen
Lil niggas that don't smile is my lynchmen
Disposable Uzis imported from Panama
We rob niggas dressed up like grandmama
We got slammers y'all, test it one, two, one two
I say "Cristal" you say "Cristaal"
And you ain't even rich nigga
Get the fuck out of my face, puffin on cat litter

Wu Block, Wu Block, Wu Block..
