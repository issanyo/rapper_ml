[Chorus: Autre Ne Veut]
Can't stop spacing, oh, no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing, and when I'm on the ground
My feet square on the ground
My head up in the clouds
Looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh, no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream

[Pre-Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yeah, nigga
Shoot 'em all, show 'em right now, yo, yo, ayo

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Starin' at ya sweatin' my Wallys
My mind got vivid thoughts of what I'm supposed to be doin'
Got the blue and the cream, me and Rah blowin' steam
Sittin' with Tarantin', nigga stackin' the green
Roll rockin', fan fuckin'
Snatchin' up mics at award shows, rollin' up O's
Wu clothes, my flows are so detrimental
Space cadet keep a cassette of instrumentals
Sling-slang the track like dick the hoes
Super intelligent, verbally diminish the pros
A visionary, my mind's like a rhyme war zone
You can't postpone the inevitable, king of the thrones
Ghostface

[Chorus: Autre Ne Veut]
Can't stop spacing
My head up in the clouds
Looking down, out of this town
You know I gotta try
My fuckin' brain's on fire
Just gotta toke again, after that
Can't stop spacing out, oh, no
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
Can't stop spacing out, oh, no
Can't stop spacing
Can't stop spacing, on a daydream
