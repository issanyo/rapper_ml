[Intro: Ghostface Killah (Trife Diesel)]
That's right, y'all
Theodore, Ghostface in the buildin
Yeah, yo, eh-yo..

[Ghostface Killah]
We out here in Amsterdam
Blowin weed up in the coffee shops, the munchees give me massive cramps
In the red light district, carryin biscuits
The Mac-11'll take plutonium, crisp shit
In the Benz cab, we got hash in little plastic bags
Flabs of chalk, we buyin up halves
And we got hoes, we ain't buyin no ass
With mad trees, we don't sleep, we just lie in the grass
With Henny bottles and bad models, foot wears and pharagamos
Ghost master the rings, entertain 'em like Lou, I'll battle
The afterparty's at the hype hotel
Y'all could all slide through, just bring me an L
Look, Amsterdam, just follow the smell
We got condoms, y'all, and we doin it well
(Yeah) Doin it, doin it, doin it well
(T.U.) Doin it, doin it, doin it well

[Chorus x2: Trife Diesel]
Eh-yo we out here in Amsterdam
Theodore came through in a Benny Hill Astro van
Big rope chains, son, outlastin ya man
Knockin out bottles of Henny like it's part of the plan

[Trife Diesel]
Eh-yo I flow like the Nile River, my style's bitter
Spit sixteen bars that'll make the crowd shiver
The White Al splitter, sprinklin the haze
Blowin on that good chronic, got me blazed for days
Zonin out, gettin high as a rocket, mad Euros in my pocket
Theodore Unit, you can't stop it
Trife Dies', I keep the bitches on their knees
Du-Lilz playin the back, yo we twistin them leaves
Niggas better freeze, when I step in the place
I'm like acne, my bare hands'll fuck up ya face
The most proliffic, the most high rated in ya district
With a hundred goons takin mushrooms blazin their biscuits
Staten Island, the most thorough, we keep it gully
Black Timbs, black army fatigues and a black skully
Last but not least, yo I gotta say peace
To all my peeps here in Amsterdam bringin the heat
.. Kubus beats

[Chorus x2]

[Shawn Wigs]
We got flows for days, purple haze, broads that fuck to The OJ's
Son we get busy, the first ones to pop off the party
With the Red Bull, bottle of Goose, Lime Bacardi
And them cannibis kept fades with the bricks of hash
Fell buyin out the bar like he holdin that cash
Master class, we go fast, ball like Yanks
We in Amsterdam, son, I want Euros not Francs
And ya girl mad, no dick, lookin so sad
She like eight pounds of shit in a two pound bag
We blow models but endure some more slow neck
This is Staten Island, we top of the line, what you expect?
Fall back or man up, our jewels are King Tut
If you down with the Theodore movement then stand up
.. Just stand up

[Chorus x2]
