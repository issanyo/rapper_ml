[Intro: Ghostface]
Tommy Hill rocking ice niggas
Tommy Hill ice rocking niggas who fuck...
Mira, aprende
Take a one on one to this shit y'all
Get your nostrils clear
Come on, sniff your brains out
All my Al Capone, Al Pacino niggas
Who's down with drug smuggling
Cappadonna, Golden Arms

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Check out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to half-moon Caesars, and all the bitches in the bleachers
Hot weather, sex on the beaches
Jewelry shopping out of the country, deluxe luxury
People saying that my chains look truck on me
But what about the Wonder Woman bracelet
Two-oh point three diamond cut engraved rubies kid, I laced it
My sweet tooth gotta nigga throbbing, ready for robbing
But first hit Maria's for a butter almond
The bionic microphone is Smack Mechanic
Move like a bunch of Mexicans with bandanas
Son it's on, so we can just max a million
I got the spot sewn so we can make a billion
The God's tropical, ladies call me black fruit punch
Rainbow flavor niggas murder niggas for lunch
Peace to the Paris Crew in the avenue, and my nigga Jay Love
Who carry switchblades on the reg, duke

[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo, the first branch, the third leaf, whoever want it got beef
I politic, show love, crush those who dare creep
Into my realm of sunshine I praise divine
Fine line between Donna dumb, deaf and blind
He ain't mine, he shook like the faggots in daytime
Crossed over grain while we was bubbling moonshine
Sipping on a Moet, laid up, Rae-Gambino
Mastermind the plan, Tony Starks, Cappachino
Developed while your head be swelling up off of the Nation
Blinded by the ice while I release the confrontation
Donna holy fat bags of weed, ravioli pasta
Bodyguard the Killa Bee songs like Kevin Costner
Infra-red all inside your bumbo, rasta
Cappadonna pimp the derby like the mobster

[Interlude: Big Un]
Yeah, yeah
Eight spaghetti lame brain ass niggas
Quarters, nickels, and dimes bitch
Except for overtime nigga
Any ass money suit me fine
Cause I'm coming strong, breaking niggas backs
Keeping shit real
If you haven't noticed bitchy ass rusty, ass nigga
Let me tell you this one time
Tony Starks, Raekwon the chef
Cappachino and Golden Arms
Is coming through mad strong
From the isles of Shaolin
For all them faggot ass
Rusty chickenhead bitches too
Shup Shup baby?

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo back in the days, bagging cracks, scraping plates, flipping cakes
Who them heavy head niggas hating Jakes
It be us, wall to wall soldiers, hanging in halls getting over
City niggas shoot for blood money rocking Rovers
Stay dipped, don't have no money in your pocket in the streets
Why these people mob money in they Jeep
Crack bums watch your back for jums
Cost me for a fake twenty dollar bill
Get 'em son, we ain't the one
Politicking, plus vicking, sick of these Dominicans
Eating good, had to shoot my way up out of Bennigans
That's life, to top it all off, beef with White
Pulling bleach out trying to throw it in my eyesight
Yo what the fuck is on your mind?
