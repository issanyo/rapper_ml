[Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'

[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Don't give a fuck, poppin' bottles in the club
Tryna fuck Atlanta bitch but let her lick the pussy up
Turn your bitch into a dyke, finna need her baptized
Pool full of liquor, finna dive in her eyes
Bitch I don't care, finna fuck a bitch with no protection I be ignant
Pray to God I'ma die with my nine on my side
Mothafuck cops, bustin' like a pork, better hide
Put my dick in her mouth, call that shit a metapo
Cigarettes to my lungs 'til I let the pistol go
Look into my eyes, tell me what you wanna do
'Fore I kill you in the street with the rest of your crew
I did this, you know this, the mark on my cheek
Where the bullet grazed, and it almost took my life
Forgot what day feels like, I only live at night
Like a bat, not a rat, never die where you at, hoe

[Verse 2: Pouya]
I canâ€™t see, walk, talk, been straight hoe breakin
Ain't nothin', the energy I generate
The underground underdog 'bout to fall off
Into another generation
I was workin, bussin' tables, now I got my own squid on the plate
Fuck the fame, baby, I don't wanna live in L.A
Back to the M-I-A to the M-I
Gon' lay with a ho, face in the coke lines
Toe taggin' rappers thinkin' that they're snappin'
Goin' bar to bar with me is suicide
You or I, do or die, baby, don't even worry about who am I
Bank account go stupid now
You should know about the whip situation (aye)
Tour been feelin' like a damn vacation
Germ fucked up, wakin' up not knowin' where he at
You was blacked out in the damn basement

[Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I don't give two fucks, I blow big bucks
Strip club, white pussy marks on my black tux
'Cause after the party's the hotel lobby
And that bitch gonna give me more head than Steve Harvey
I keep a duffle bag, not like the money team
All coked out on a scale of a triple beam
Nah mean? Fuck a team of guerrillas
Silverback stomp out your gang of chinchillas
Suitcase, military scopes
Korean shotty up the sleeve of my coat
Each slug is like one big egg roll
Impact, you could lose half of your leg, bro
'Cause we don't play those games
Franco hit the deck, click, clack, take aim
Guns never jam, we don't waste rounds
Best shot's behind the ear like chhhk BOW

[Hook: Rich Brian]
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do'
Man, I don't give a fuck about a mothafuckin' po
I'ma pull up with that stick and hit yo motherfuckin' do' (yeah)
