[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine and I like them slick
Them slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans, when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony, pinned over the ledge
Been a few days but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and rent over your head
Not the same hoes to rescue anybody
But a nigga knows what stress do to the body
And no they see me on the best shoot buzzing naughty
Shit be looking fresh like shoes and Bugatti's
And I don't know why you been in high heels
But I swear we all on one
And if you do know that man, girl
I be like, where you know 'em from
You so slick, so small, curvy
Teeth all pearly, hair all curly
When it's time for it, you look all girly
Never look tired, but you wake up all early
Hit the gym, to keep it toned up
Progress, keep picking your phone up
Ah shit, waist getting smaller, niggas all on Instagram
Like damn I need to call her

[Hook: Jeremih & Fabolous]
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything lookin' just fine
You got that blessin' in disguise
You Wouldn't know it, girl you got me

Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Damn, you got a fat lil' pussy
Meatloaf gangsta, real good nookie
Only love hard rocks, tough lil' cookie
Leave a nigga balls all blue like a tookie
Yeah pretty walnut skin, pistachio an guinness, got me 4 nuts in
I record what is dome busting
Stay going raw on Forbes Hustling
The ass in the kitchen, hash for the Simson
Butt naked clean up my gun and you're all vintage
You loaded it up, cocked over the sink
Cock in my hand, while I'm pouring your drink
Yo, yo watch how you hold that lady
Eighteen hundred grand hammers, I'mma throw that baby
Flying through the city in the old ack navy
While he green peril with caves in the state key
Now bouncing your butt up, milf queen vadge better built
We can make love real slow cuz it's better felt
Yeah surely murder that thing as we slept that night away
I had to swerve out of king
Off the chain work out chick that do yoga
Leg over her head, finger in her chocha
That's my type of chick
Ride or die body, ride body, yo' them are slick
