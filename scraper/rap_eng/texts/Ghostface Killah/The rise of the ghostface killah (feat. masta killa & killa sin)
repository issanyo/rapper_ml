Young aggressor born into the life of crime
I would walk down the street strapped with two 9s
Bitch smackin' jackin' niggas, g-dub stackin' figures
Police drive buy I was click calckin' triggers
Jay DeLucas put me with the fam to grow
I was the boss amongst white boys, rockin' the fro
I had hoes, bank rolls, and minks by the dozen
My rise to power was quick they just wasn't
Tried to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan
I blacked out on em and started my own clan
Black gambino, black suits, black syndicate
My crime fam was tight every move was intricate
The coke was brought in from bagged Columbian mules
Gorgeous women that I draped down in jewels
Street fights started, mafia wars in Italy
Crime fam against fam and no one can do didely
Do the dirty work
Bring in the coke by the boat loads
Go against the grain nigga, i feed nose hoes
Follow no family rules, rules are for fools
Chase the paper cause it's the cash that rules
Fuck the law of the fam
Mr. law of the land
You don't like how i'm moving then try to force my hand
I'm moving keys them DeLucas couldn't touch my pianos
Putting pressure on them gambinees and varazanos
They love my money they hate to see a nigga gettin' it
Sellin' drugs is taboo but I ain't fuckin' sweatin' it
Dirt got to get done so I took my position
One day I'm black to em with a lot of ambition
The next I got status dinners with all courses
Flights in and out of the country they gettin' nauseous
Money, power, and respect
Rise of the black suits
Talk shit behind my back but to my face salute
Hugs and handshakes they can't stop my reign
Got the coke in they collars bring the shit on the plane
It's a shame they didn't have the balls to make moves
They pussy couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
