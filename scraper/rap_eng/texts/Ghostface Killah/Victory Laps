[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
AH-HEM!
Bust off your straps after Victory Laps
For a rhyme-o-cidal maniac, rap run runners
Kingpin numbers they kick knee-slap skat
Dreidel loose, Villain on the track in your town
Like Ringling Brothers, bring rings around clowns
Got ‘em bowin down in surround-sound, drown (WORD!)
Pawn somethin for a small fortune
Go broke, sell portion to an auction, caution
Name your price and that time's fourscore of course
No love lost, enter the town on tour de force, cost more
Give or take the off day, short stay
In case the gaudy shorty need the horseplay
Raw hay, rakin' in the dough, no connection
Came home lames bidded, still payin' protection
Villain no kiddin' when he ain’t rhyme checkin'
Or in the sunshine with a fine dime neckin'
He lightin' up the Olympic torch with sparks glow
A gimp god's corso, pass it off... Starks go

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Bringin' it home it’s the relayed laps; twist cats, put ‘em on they ass
The other half on they neck and they back
Prepare your vest for the Victory Laps
Take titles and give ‘em back, World Series Hummers
Veteran numbers, still spit that crack
Bottles of Goose in the backpack
Niggas talkin' like ‘Yeah Tony Starks, don’t you dare let us down
Your hits be immaculate, and accurate’
Like the targets of Jake Plummer (word!)
Started all that talk of bein' a gunner
Beef in the winter leaves the death in the summer
Switchin' the Franks, army tanks
Fuck a bodyguard, it’s me and the iron
I’m secure like federal banks, pirates
Y’all niggas better walk the plank, motherfucker!

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Bluka! Bluka!
Compliments of the gentlemen in all black
In the back, softball stack off the wall plaque
For all slack, track who diss is tricky
Hope to fix the problem with the rack & pinion doohickey
Not too quickly, they softer than a gooch
As I proceed to pop the clutch like a cooch, brooch
It broke loose, scratched the side slidin'
Disappeared off of the horizon, glidin'
You’re now ridin' with the rude gin and ginseng drinkin'
Sing a Sting song smooth as mink skin
Drop a jewel to keep the king’s men thinkin'
Filthy Metal Fingers leave the ink pen stinkin'
Move! The lab is in a mess
Wreakin', speakin' from the heart like a stabbin' in the chest
Leakin' in a cab in distress, blinkin', home
Poems ringin' in his dome, clingin' to chromosomes
