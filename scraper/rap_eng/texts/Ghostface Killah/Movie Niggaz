Naw I say uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

[Sheek Louch]
Aced out yached out not givin a fruck
West side highway doin over a buck
Broad day its like Curtis May shotgun wit me
White airs, blue jeans this the top of dickie
I ain't picky, some sticky in the bitch to roll it
Phat ass Lui or Gucci or work to hold it
50 thousand big heads kind of hard to fold it
And I don't need needle or threat to say I sold it
Big money, big guns and all that stuff
Black brief case, one wrist handcuff
You get you man snuffed
Fuck 'em like G-O-D
Got that white boy sellin like pOD
And I ain't tryin to sun ya'll
Or some tough guy shit I just ain't scared to none ya'll
Run ya'll
Ten years strong, you one year weak
Ya'll ain't fuckin wit Sheek
Bark at the frawg

Yo I get married in crutch Velvet
Diamond chip shit that'll squash elders
You know the steez when I come through steamin my stones
Through on eight floor studed it out cleanin my chrome
I disinfect niggas, wash 'em, rinse 'em and hang dry 'em
Bang iron, to all top is pro-long cuz it takes science
No larceny, murder experts in the feds, yo they on to me
Like I murdered Vonny, me and Sheek Louch
We can regroup, we can recoupe
We eat leak soup, speed race across country in the mean coupe
We got whips and big chains at the day back routes
Enron money, they say we goin down on tax invasion
Tellin cops if they try to cuff us the max is sprayin
Finally the head in they hats where they badge is layin
On the floor right along where their colleague is prayin
Nigga, this is Theodore and D-Block
Fuck 'round and get your meat chopped

[Hook: Ghostface Killah & Sheek Louch]

[Sheek Louch]
Ease back, whats that all about, huh?
I dare ya'll niggas tryin to play Sheek Louch out
Like I don't find talent like a Yankees Scout
Like I ain't still got it when papi on the drought
The hood got swear tryin to be circle
I don't give a fuck I'll leave a bunch dead Urkels
I don't pillow talk, I'll tell a ho what she need to know
I don't care if she thicker than pizza dough, I'm out standin
I ain't even landin in the same place I use to when I come down high
I wake up wit two bitches in between my thigh
And I ain't hollywood or rich, bitch I ain't Mcky
I just mad at tellin a good ass lie
Yo, nuttin 'bout me soft, I don't care if you got cake
Whateva, go'head go on brush you shoulders off
I be in the hood, Sheek Louch good
