Hey miss what up, Tone got luck
I wore a lot of jewelry and I never got stuck
Cats like the way I write, dress like a superstar
Take car of family so I don't have stupid cars
Peace to all single ladies struggle with a ruff life
Baby daddy fronting
That's aight check out my man Trife
Represent Stapleton, raised in the West
780 Anderson now I'm the best
Stopping all bets slamming niggas like Barkley
Back in my reefer days sellin you parsley
Always kept aluminum bats in the car seat
Then I showed Doo and them, That's were the narcs be
Came to play no games and stay in your lane
And the ratchets on your brain and fuckin to aim at yall
Big spender, Rock a robe in November
I never broke bud I throw my trees up in a blender

[Hook: Ghostface Killah]
How you like it baby
You wanna good time, You alright you alright
Come on, How you like it baby
Can I roll with you tonight

[Verse 2]
Yo, You better shoot spots, Red and blue drops
I used to serve those, those maroon tops, (Go head)
Then crack the window when the fuckin rooms hot
If my CD was skippin get a different boom box
New socks full of polo chet, rugged low mocs
So hot, Right before I pop the fuckin show stops
You can't box, I Seen better hands on an old clock
The old ox never marked you, Ima blow pops
Prophesize Don, it's me
Aqua blue mink, In my bitch arms and feet
20 g's real niggas like pardon me
Ima be honest to your man with the Dom P, More like Sean Connery
Heard he fight crime like the old man Barnaby
Giving you the business, Crack heads and wannabes
And I keep drugs in the Toney Starks pharmacy
Desperate house wives slobbing me cause they honor me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now if it wasn't for the Wu
Tell me if this rap shit would really carry on
Now tell me where you from
Staten Isle baby, Up town baby
Boogie down baby, Brook-Don baby
Now if it wasn't for the Ghost
None of yall rap niggas would be writing songs
Now tell me where yall from
Queens bound baby, Long Isle baby
New Jerus baby, Connecticut baby
Hey mister, please let my niggas in
Thugs and my women in, You don't want no problem wit me
We got them burners on the dance floor
Goons is already in, Shanks and Machetes in
3 to the head again, Ghost Remy Hennessy
All yall haters what yall mad for
