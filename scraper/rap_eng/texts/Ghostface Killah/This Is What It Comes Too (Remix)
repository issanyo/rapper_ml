[Intro: Raekwon]
Get the fuck up out the spot nigga
Burn that nigga feet up man
This nigga in here man
Fuck this nigga doin' b
Black nigga in Boston by fiends you wild ass
Get this motherfuckin' giraffe ass nigga outta here man
Sheet skin socks ass nigga right here b
What the hell is goin' on man?
Light that nigga feet up son, c'mon man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I done blacked out, no man is safe, your crew is cornered
Why did you think you could step over me? I'm too enormous
Plus I heard you was an informant, cold brew sell 'em
Roll out the plastic, I'm about to catch a body on this
Low threat [?] I don't make those
Soak my bullets in cyanide so when they touch you, that's a case closed
Dime pieces I bag 'em, follow this pen scroll
Hoes, I don't chase those, too much drama with 'em
Not alone, I don't have time for, I'm raw, fuck a bitch feelings
I'm on some old goldie shit chillin'
Business man baby steak, be deucin' them dollar signs
Line for line, I'm dope don't mix me with Kwana
When the spike hit, it'll make flatline, period
One word to describe my grind, son I'm serious
Shank doctor with choppers, rainin' on ya militants
Guns drawn, blowing out ya back ain't concealin' shit

[Chorus: Raekwon]
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, later on when I die I wanna fly
I'm a warrior with my shirt sleeves
Slip me a few rounds of oreos
Can't go tilted and you just like "Ghost he killed it"
Sledgehammer, rap the whole damn Clan we built it
Brick by brick corporal dryin', the oxi work miracles
Pray for the healthy from alphabet cereal
I was taught to bang on niggas that's quick to talk
Moment of silence, bow ya head get it blown off
Rose, roxie and [?] plus [?] background
Hammie still shootin' when the song's off
Wow wow like a dungeon dragon
Coaxed by a cop downstairs don't stop the baggin'
Clips hangin' like a strawberry, Charleston frut
Strawberry shortcake, great lemonade and goo
Whether the projects or a drive by, bodies on the drog neck
Lightin' up the ass bettin' niggas on a side bench yeah
Stack chips like legos, pop up on you niggas like egos
Two hands on the draco
Hole in your back the size of a miniature bagel
Livewires with ya girls still suckin' our huevos
We back at it, stack habits, still servin' crack addicts
Louie baggin', we the baddest, 24 karat atlas
Tell [?] I'm aware 29 savage is [?]
Rock niggas bite the head of a bird like Black Sabbath

[Chorus: Raekwon]
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
I'm nice, targets get hit whenever I squeeze
Don status, get my dick sucked whenever I please
Above the law brick, beat cases, don't cop pleads
I buy my cars, bet y'all niggas whips be leased
I'm a wolf off the loose, somebody find his leash
I'm a star, you a starburst sweeter than fruit
No kinda background claimed killer, then who did you shoot
Must've imagined that, with your far-fetched raps
Shit is real over here, say we blast on Satan
Take trips in and out of the country
Turn dark clouds to sunny, I'm livin' good, my paper got me comfy
You in the hood jokin' you wanna war with me
I get your project shot down while your land lord sleep
Now you in too deep, no turning back from your actions
You a killer then show me, if not then meet my savages
The general, I'll have my goons tear up your establishment

[Chorus: Raekwon]
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare
This what it comes to, wilin' like the west and down
In this concrete jungle, homie hope you got ya vest on
And ya weapon is oil don't it jam but if it do
Leave ya crew when it's time for that warfare
