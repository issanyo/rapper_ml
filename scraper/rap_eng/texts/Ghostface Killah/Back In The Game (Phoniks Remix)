[Hook]
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope

[Hook]
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind

[Verse 2: Raekwon the Chef]
Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, coolin' with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin' with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin'
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin'
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Most people say the Clan was missin' since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines

[Hook]
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind
Do you believe it's morning
I'm alive
But thats the last thing on my mind
