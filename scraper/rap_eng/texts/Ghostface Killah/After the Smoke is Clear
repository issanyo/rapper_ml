[Intro: Ghostface Killah (The Delphonics)]
(After the smoke is done)
Yo yeah
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, what, what, who wanna do it, what
(After the smoke is done)
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats, yo

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, god show these niggas how we get deep, down and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back, for 5 birdies
Yo they gotta hit placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews?
Never that, don't ever look at me out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck, like the poor part we watch Hart To Hart
They used to push me in shopping carts, now I'm writing darts
Like Ebenezer, the porno teaser
Saying words like sheeba, ____ rapper valet the visa
My team got rides like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own DATs
Don't touch this crackling hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half, laugh and pop shit
Reader's Digest passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
It got back that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it, booby-trap raps cover the track like ADAT
Sharper than cuts laced on Marley
Scratched supreme clientele, my cartel
Willie Stargel passed this shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh well, signing off as usual
The arsonist leaving niggas lost in the stairwell

[Break: Ghostface Killah (The Delphonics)]
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
Yeah, yo, yo, represent my projects Stapleton
(After the smoke is done)
He represent that project Park Hill
(Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one)
You represent that project Murder West Brighton, Now Born
Arm banging into that will (ahhhhh), word up
(After the smoke is clear)
Yeah, what, Stapleton
(Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral IV plus three describe me
My son move like the toad, get drunk, speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold, got beef with the globe
Met my comrade, go half on this lab down in Baghdad
Flipping like a meth's tab, get money like an Arab
The tight niggas snapped six legs on the crab
Now hush, you wanna do what? My clique better bust

[Verse 3: RZA]
Underprivileged, grew up in a Stapleton house village
Where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
My front door was blowing, the debt man spotted 55 boa
Niggas was still flowing, voice was echoing
I rise high like an octave
The proctor wouldn't gamble the sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run round like Shaka Zulu
Some play peace like Ganj the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Tutu
Undisputed champion belt holders, shaped and mould us
Soul controller of the lunar, solar or the polar
I blow hash smoke through my nasal, my brain with worth 30 billion
Wu-Tang third battalion was like  Hannibal raiding Sicilians

[Outro: The Delphonics]
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Delphonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang/Delphonics number one
Ahhhhh (Wuuuuuu, wuuuuuu)
