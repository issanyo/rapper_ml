I'mma go hard on ya'll niggas
Dart ya'll niggas out, dropping science
To let ya'll know what the kid about
I hang like the disco ball, on the floor
I'm like John Travolta, suade blazing with my chest showing
Rings and them hard jeans, please, I'm comfy in the spot
So I'm never handcuffing my queen
It's a Theodore movement, Glock holding kids
With the chocolate boomers, aiyo fuck those rumors
Leave your chick around me, I'll get those bloomers
Bang that like des' gun, mask with the cowskin Puma's
Keep staring down the eyes of the champ, anywhere in this rap shit
Punk muthafucka, I get you blamped, word life, my throat is high
See RiggaTone with the velvet mask on
Cleaning his glass song, when ya'll niggas get ya feet done
I'm in the whore house with my man Wigs, getting his beak on

[Chorus 2X: cartoon sample (Ghostface Killah)]
"Ironman"
"The world can't touch Ghost"
"Ironman"
"Who the hypest in New York City"
"Ironman"
"You can't destroy this"
"Ironman"
"Big Ghost steps off laughing"
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I've done walked on fire (fire), never got burnt (burnt)
Slept on glass (glass), never got cut (cut)
And broke a few nose bones, yo, light off a round or two
At certain dudes where they dropped they phones
Yo this straight crack (yeah), even my hand got tooken to jail
For writing murder, my wrist couldn't take it in bail
They left my fingers for dead, told 'em
"I ain't have nothing to do with the writing"
I hold you down when you be squeezing that lead
Shopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's
Rolling in threes, in them purple capri's'
A gritty bop, my watch is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels
Your old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle
And I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out
Poofed the nails off, ya faggots can figure the price out
It's chump change, ya'll bitch niggas go get my coco
Get my slippers, before I go gun ho!

[Chorus 2X]
