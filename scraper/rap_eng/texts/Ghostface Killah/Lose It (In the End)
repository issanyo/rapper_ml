[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Can't let you go, huh

[Chorus: Mark Ronson]
Yeah, I've said too much again
Yeah, I've pushed too hard again
Now I wanna stop, but when?
I always lose it in the end
Stupid once again
You wanna be my friend
I've pushed too hard again
I always lose it in the end

[Post-Chorus: Mark Ronson]
I don't know how I can let you go
How will I let you go?

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo
Ayo, I keep my guards up when it come to the women
Tone knew that ever since the beginning
That's why I stay in clubs, down in the white denim
'Cause y'all girls is poison, peace to Mike Bivins
I couldn't let you go and you know that
I can't see another man trying to blow that
That's critical, love shots hurtin' me
Doctor Winfield said I need therapy
Torment, misery is killing me physically
Why murder me legally? I loved you convincingly
So I'ma close my eyes and just pretend
'Cause word on the street's I'ma lose it in the end

[Chorus: Mark Ronson]
Yeah, I cared too much again
And you stared too much at him
And this must be a sin
I always lose it in the end
"Just chill out" is what you said
"Take a pill and go to bed"
No matter how or when
Always lose it in the end

[Post-Chorus: Mark Ronson]
I don't know how I can let you go
How will I let you go?

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I do what it does when it come to the ladies
'Cause things ain't changed since the early eighties
A few babies but I'm still pickin' them crazies
You wanna battle in court like Kim and Slim Shady
I ain't havin' that, nope, I ain't havin' that
You just tryin' to get rich like Miramax
Forced my hand, girl, to let you know
'Cause gettin' over on starks is real unnatural

[Chorus: Mark Ronson]
Yeah, I said too much again
Yeah, I pushed too hard again
Now I wanna stop, but when?
I always lose it in the end
Stupid once again
You wanna be my friend
I'll push too hard again
I always lose it in the end

[Post-Chorus: Mark Ronson]
I don't know how I can let you go
How will I let you go?
