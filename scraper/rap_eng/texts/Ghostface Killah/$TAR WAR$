Back to school shopping bought a Rambo

I eat the soup no Campbell

Slither yo bitch like randell

I be so jolly, I ain't on no molly, but I wanna suck your bitch sandle

Green, green, bay no lambeau

Green green green my lambo

Yo shawty blow me like a candle

Riding my bike with no handles

Put my strap up on the mantle

Scheme with the boys that’s a scandle

Spray up your home like a vandel

We might strike down like an anvil

If you touch me, call handball

Surfing on waves like they channels

Yoppa on me got an angle


Run wit me i got the rambo (got it)

Lil bitch i got on gucci sandles (aye aye)

I get the money don't gamble (slatt)

I'm in the field no Randell (touchdown)

We could sword fight with some paddles (aye)

These hoes is snakes without rattles

We on kamino fight battles (gang)

Playing these bitches like scrabble

We run it up in the trap

Got your bitch right on my lap (okay!)

Count up the bands, take a nap

Ballin hard pramit jagtap

This pistol gon turn you sap

In the endgame it’s a wrap

You ain't on shit boy you cap

Fucked your bitch put it on snap

Cooking i'm whippin the pot

You thought you cool but you not

You buy your views you a bot

Flashin the gram like a thot

Flick off these bitches like bic

Walk in the store hit a lick

Keep the k on me like swiss

My yoppa hit it don't miss
