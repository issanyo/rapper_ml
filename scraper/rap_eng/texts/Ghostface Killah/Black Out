[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Kane, let's get 'em
I'm talking blackout
Put lives to an end, fuck a tapout
All in together, we gon' wipe 'em
Wax in revenge mode, time for some action

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Yeah, relentless, murderous intentions
The henchmen's garments is all black, that's the winners that pimp this
Caught up in my spell, smell exotic, blunt from different trees
Black gloves, bullets will fly when the 9's squeezed
Ghost and I thick as thieves, robbing the whole globe
Black polo, hooded, with Gucci robes with a nice grip
So when the blood hit the floor, I won't slip
Dynamic with my dialogue, you faggots is hog meat
Crack your cranium like crab claws if you cross me
Raging Bull in the booth, Mr. Kane is so raunchy

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Death Row shit, fuck the lethal injection
Execute him and chop up his body in sections
Clean-cut butcher knives
X their eyes out
Nail 'em to a billboard
Let 'em dry out

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Let me show you what crime about, I'm blowing your minds out
If you ain't ready to throat a nigga, then sign out
Nickel-plated 40's are blowing your spine out
Old-school Caddies with coke, come take a line out
Stingin' niggas for their jewels in their stash house
Snatch a nigga up by his butterfly, sing him a lullaby
Closed-casket, make sure his mother cry
You fuckin' with grimy guys, tunes are suicidal
And now we ain't homies, they call us the homicidal
Get ready for the mayhem, just call it my arrival

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Bash him with a disco ball, it's the 70's
Drop a set of the Daily News so they remember these
Black bastards, ruthless killers

[Verse 6: Raekwon]
Watch me thrill ya
Party killers, we won't die
Hard-body, bitch-made cats is gonna fry
Solidify we're champions, youngins, we're bona fide
Wanna swim with the sharks, be my guest, go take a dive
The name of the game is Bloodsport
You won't make it out alive
I see what you trying for, so give it up
We terrorize shit, Kane and Ghost, lit it up
