[Pre-Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
One, two, three, four
Blaka blaka blaka ah

[Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
I got bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I keep shit right, eat her pussy, tight
It's okay motherfucker, it's chill, chill
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real

[Verse 1: Ivan Ooze]
Bills, bills
I fuckin' got them bills
I ain't talkin' 'bout them stacks
So get back to movin' them pills
Do you really think we wanna drug deal?
Do you think we wanna lie, cheat and steal?
Ransack, fill the backpack, jump into the hatchback
Move them wheels and off we peel
These streets don't give you nothin'
That's why I gotta take me somethin'
I mother be strugglin', hustlin'
Payin' her mortgage, rent, water, debt
Torture, dis-order, never been poorer
Hard to get employment when you're always on tour
Fuck this system, that's what I oughta do
So I preach this to ya daughter

[Pre-Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
One, two, three, four
Blaka blaka blaka ah

[Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
I got bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I keep shit right, eat her pussy, tight
It's okay motherfucker, it's chill, chill
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real

[Verse 2: Ivan Ooze]
Real, real
Till I'm pushin' up them daisies
Yeah, I tell it how it is
Live this shit up on the daily
See I'm tryna stay positive
But when your bank account say negative
You feel the whole world be your nemesis
I know one way to reap benefits
Mask it up
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
I never say never, but I never say much
Collect dirty cheddar then I send it in a letter
To my mother motherfucker, just to get her through the winter
So bitter damn, I'm a bitter man
But since I've been immoral had time to plan
While the sand fall my team expands
In high demand, fuck a reg program ergh

[Pre-Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
One, two, three, four
Blaka blaka blaka ah

[Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
I got bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I keep shit right, eat her pussy, tight
It's okay motherfucker, it's chill, chill
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Babies cryin', homies dyin'
That's one of the reasons I keep that iron
Every little hollow-head get to flyin'
Protect where I rest at like a lion
Bills, bills, for it I kill
How could I let my kids sleep with no meal?
You don't even know how much blood I would spill
If I can't put meat or grilled cheese on the grill
My landlord want that rent
Baby mama screamin' she broke
Car dealer need that note
My old lady need new coat
Listen, I need that green like a bottle of scope
Every month take care of my folks
Flow like clear blue water under a boat
Before I leave the game, they like "That motherfucker, he spoke"

[Pre-Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
One, two, three, four
Blaka blaka blaka ah

[Chorus: Ivan Ooze]
I got bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I keep shit right, eat her pussy, tight
It's okay motherfucker, it's chill, chill
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
I stay one-hunnid while I split these bills
You don't know what it's like to not eat three meals
Bills, bills, I got bills
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real

[Outro: Ivan Ooze]
Yo, y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
Yo, y'all motherfuckers don't keep shit real
