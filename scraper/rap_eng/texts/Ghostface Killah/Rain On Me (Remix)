[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, uh, Ghostface, Ashanti, uh-huh, yeah
Aiyo, baby, I want you to
Explain to me everything you just been going through lately
I know you been dealing with a lot of problems
I'm here, just talk to me, please

[Ashanti]
I'm lookin in the mirror at this woman down and out
She's internally dying, and knew this was not what love's about
I don't wanna be this woman, the second time around
Cuz I'm wakin' up screamin', no longer believing, that I'm gonna be around

[Hook 2X: Ashanti]
Over and over I try, and over and over you lie
And over and over I cry

[Hook 2X: Ashanti]
Rain on me (Lord won't you take this)
Pain from me, (I don't wanna live, I don't wanna breathe til you just)

[Ashanti]
See I don't wanna hug my pillow late at night no more
I'm tossing and turning, and thinkin' about burning down these walls
I don't wanna feel this fire no more, no more, no more
See I made up my mind cause I wasted my time
Ain't nothing here to keep me warm
[Hook 2X]

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo Ashanti, don't let this young boy stress you and shit
Put the knife down, I said, put it down here
Take this tissue and chill and come here now
If I was the real last month, I would've broken down
On the strength, seein' you cry, is like havin' visions of watchin' you die
And you know I can't take that, so
What these brothers lack is grown man experience
They too young, and can't love and won't take you serious
Baby, I come to you, on this very day, that's my word
I promise to cherish, promise to love
No more lonely nights, no more wet pillows
No more empty hugs, rub your right earlobe
The sweat off my body'll be a rain when the touch is yours
I promise to wait for you to drop them drawers
And there is one thing, you must understand
We gon' dance in the rain, can I be your man?

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah baby, you know
Sometime you gotta go through hell to come out right
Youknowhatimsayin, and I know
I understand everything you goin' through, youknowhatimsayin
It's like, through this full rainstorm, you gotta be strong
Youknowhatimsayin, you gotta be understandin' the raining
Youknowhatimsayin, it's like everything's gon' be alright
The sun always gonna come out, youknowhatimsayin
That's why I'm here, I wanna just bring a little smile to on your face
And just rub your back, and just, massage you a little bit
Rub your earlobe and, kiss that neck of yours, and
Rub your feet, tell you to chill
Youknowhatimsayin', baby, this is me
Straight from Staten Island, baby...
