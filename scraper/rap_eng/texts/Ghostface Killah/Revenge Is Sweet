[Intro: Sample]
"You asked me to secure a place for you in history. History is watching, waiting for a decision. This is your moment"

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, revenge is sweet, that's why I take my time with it
Like good pussy I just stay when I'm up in it
Evil plan, my mind functions well off spite
I don't do that tit for tat, I blow your shit up like dynamite
Take my life, I'll take every one you love
Have your kids thrown out of a plane, “Look out cuz”
My plots are like movie scripts, they well planned
Snatch you off the land and drop you off in the Sahara sand
So don't scam, don't try to double cross me
My Tennessee goons'll nail that ass to the cross, B
Revenge mode, I live life by the sword
And if you live by it, die by it, I'll still kill your horse
Set me up, coming back, like a thief in the night
I'll have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight
You couldn't take my life, my mask done resurrected
And I'm Ghostface Killah, way more than you expected

[Interlude: RZA]
Those involved with this tale cursed the day they ever heard the name Tony Starks, and wreaked the day they heard the music was played from the records which comprised of his flesh

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Yes, but what they didn't expect
A hundred ghouls from the projects
Armed and masked with flamethrowers and gas'll blast anything
Hung him by his tongue ring, till he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk
Made him sign the ransom, then gave the note to his grandson
Bust the shot and made him run fast back to his family
News of his discovery would set off a chain of events
That would then lead to members of DeLucas to bleed with no exception
They sent the wrong message so kill everything, no exception to the media
There would not be a retire or cease fire till every Luca has expired, in entirety
Wishes of the god, Tone Starks to eternity, respectfully

[Interlude: RZA]
Cutthroats, murder sprees, and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing. So it'd only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life

[Verse 3: Killa Sin]
I keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards, cutting outside the benches
Got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
Four years, five flat post-release supervision
For niggas spitting in the wind, but that's what I get for missing
So soon as I hit the bridge again, niggas is finished
Ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
Think I'm sitting up in prison with a tin of L, in a cell, sick ass hell, listen
Everyday is like Christmas, I miss my seed and my missus, but I see ‘em on visits
I ain't stressing over pussy, beat my dick to her pictures
When they free me I'mma see you, leave you food for the fishes
Hope the Luca crew is in for the fixing, now get the henchman
Line ‘em up, Tommy gun ‘em down, the muzzle extension
Tear they flesh off if one of ‘em flinching
