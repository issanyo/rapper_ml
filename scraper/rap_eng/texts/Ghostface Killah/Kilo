[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
(Yo, Oh, Yo Rae... I can't feel my face
My heart pounding and shit (audible heart)
Paranoid as a motherfucker right now, who the fuck?
Close them blinds and shit! Who that? Captain Kirk?
This the fucking Stark...enterprise, enterprise outside and some shit?
I need some pussy though I'm ready to fuck Catwoman or something
F-fuck it, lets go!
Aiyyo shareefa go to the store for me. I need some razors and a fresh box
Of baggies, the ones with the tint in them!
Aiyyo son turn that water down a little bit, just a little bit..Thank You
I need two waters, a dutch, and a cranberry Snapple)

All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Whoever got the kilos got the candy, man!)
A kilo is one thousand grams, its easy to remember
(You never catch the kid going hand to hand!)
All around the world today, the Kilo is the measure
(Once you got the funds you got the panties, man!)
A Kilo is a thousand grams, its easy to remember
(Throughout I-95 I'm the Handyman)

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Bricks, Tar caps, powder, cooked up crack
Phones is tapped over franklin's stacks
Kingpins put in bullpens, old connects get paro'
Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharoah
Reason, He was moving that peruvian white
Blowing coolies in the hoopties , slamming cuties at night
Big heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order
A Kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants
The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Yeah
Aiyyo peace to those cooking that raw, powder white
Get your sniff on, scarface niggas, we getting right
Some call it bricks, some call it birds
How many niggas get they lives tooken playing with shit, then catch a curve
You would go to jail
Get caught with this, niggas'll grow to fail
Stop playing, pot slaying, baking soda and scales
They lived like brothers, word life, connects discovered
Most niggas get hard, from fucking with them pipes and hustlers
Kilo is one thousand grams
You know your ammo better be heavy cause soon kids is coming in camo
Protect your land daddy, I'm an announcer
You get caught with an ounce and its over
Matter 'fact they takin you down, son

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin the ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks
When they wrapped and stuffed
Four days later straight cash, two million bucks
Strictly powder, no cut
Your coke is vialed in, whats up?
Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
Kilo is a thousand grams
A pile of sand is equivilant, to the eye
It's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars
Therefore, you check for wires
Dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters

[Bridge: Raekwon]
Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops
Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops
Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops
Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops
Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's
58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks
Big rocks, coke spots, two Glocks, one ox
Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot
