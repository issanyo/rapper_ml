Modern girls!!

(sung)
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to for..

[Mos Def] - speaking over sung vocals
I say girls, girls, girls, girls
Reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan
And, bring the breeze, bring the breeze

[Mos Def]
And from the moment that I saw ya, I knew you was trouble
But I disregarded, detour signs
And did not stop til you was mine
I guess God was like, aight fine
Careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it in heaps
Try to give it back he be like - nah that's yours to keep
So poetic baby girl you make it hard to speak
My dream lover make it hard to sleep
.. I wrote a little song about it

In she came with the same type game
The hairdo, Prada shoes, brand new Gucci frame
Big thangs, so big you can't hardly explain
When she done crossed her legs, she make mind turn insane
Had seen her on the ave and spotted her, how I wanted her
Ass so fat she think police tryna follow her
What you lo-lo-love, expert in the bedwork corridor
Man see a touches her, man you'll feel sorry for
Hustlers, bubblers, jugglers, sufferers
All wanna know what her name and phone number was
They're spendin up their money like, post them up and touch her up
But it don't (?) tough, X-amount of (?)
Son, bwoy, African and tough, all nice and decent
A-yeah yeah, I'm tryin to ride with a diamond like you
Lookin pretty in the club, plus she love Mos and Wu

[Ghostface Killah]
Ass wide and fat, breasts mad, hair wrapped
Wilma style, chunky, that's how I like my batch
You a rose from the hood, smoked out of 89
We headed back, you had a baby by Ron
But that's irrelevant, bygones is bygones
Calgon is Calgons, love it when you jump in Ghost thongs
Steppin out of B-B-Q's
'Member when we licked the cream out of Suzy Q's?
Spaghetti jewels, the big word on the street
You like Millie Jackson in the new Mack flick carryin heat
Or say with Oprah with a makeover, Billie Jean slash Dairy Queen
Fantasy is, can I eat you on the swing?
See it's written all over my face, Daily News
Big bold lettered, front page, Starks how it taste?

(sung)
.. forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to for..

[Mos Def] - speaking over sung vocals
To all the fine-ass ghetto troublemakers from all over the world
Ass from New York, to L.A., Miami to Atlanta G.A
Cakalaks, to the Bay.. any place in the world that they stay
Even Japan and the U.K., you know you got to

[Mos Def]
Watch out! Louisana jug wine and conk out
Throw her hands high and make her backside pop out
Watch out! If you don't have the V.I.P. lacq' out
Them big dollars they talk 'bout, just turn around and walk out
You better watch out! Exotic fabrics, speech in larynx
Think it's mid-day traffic, runnin game like the Mavericks
Makin time seem elastic when we stretch out and smash it
Then vanish like a phantom and hurt my understandin like WHAT??

(sung)
.. forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget
I know, I can't afford to stop
For a moment.. that it's too soon.. to forget

[Mos Def] - speaking over sung vocals
Special, special dedication
To all the fine-ass ghetto troublemakers, out in the world today
Some in this very party right here right now tonight
Some of them listenin to this song in they jeeps
Some of them listenin to this song at they job
Some of them runnin game on some cat right now
I want you to just rock and bounce to that
Rock and bounce to that

{*music comes back in*}

[Mos Def]
I say girls, girls, girls, girls
Reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan
And, bring the breeze, bring the breeze
Say girls, girls, girls, girls
Reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan
And, bring the breeze, bring the breeze
