I play hard for nine innings dressed in fine linen
Cause pussy is the best next thing besides women
All the position I've been in couldn't explain how I'm living
My vision my intuition has risen
Here take a listen I'm hitting
Up to bat with precision
Sealing bags in the kitchen
Slinging crack to these pigeons
For the fact that I'm driven
My linebackers is missing
Send you back and good rides
Trapped in this mission where snakes and rats is forbidden
Keep my gun hidden niggas is bitches signing petitions
And they providing convictions
See I survive through the system under the livest conditions
My riders ride on a mission for snitching
You get your back blown right out of commission
You'll be missing like them crazy Christians and swimming with all the fishes
Your misses will come and visit your body with hugs and kisses
Now tell me is that nutritious we party with chips and liquors
Your wisses is coming with us for real kid they bought me presents
The difference is this is business big biscuits big figures
We click on religious niggas for acting too superstitious
Move cause the group is viscous
Shoot if you want your wishes to blow
See trife in the Bentley with a group of bitches

My design is already made
So young an so strong
And just waiting to be saved
My life's no longer in the hands of district attorneys or envious niggas
Who thirsty cause I'm OT with prince with thirty moving like magic
But niggas ain't worthy like Michael cooper when I shoot I aim sturdy
Mother maiden mother fuck em
Rhymes so dope I hope I make it through customs
We can take it to the streets like a game at the rucker
They claim they love us but all that changes
When you on and they fucked up dog ain't no flaws in a hustla
I ain't no longer in state greens and chuckers
Waiting for the beach port and the breaks streets oughta relate
I see it all in your face the window to your soul ain't tinted
You want to see me falling from grace
No way nigga I'm stretching my weight like cocaine dealers
What they gonna say now the flow way iller
If dough change things I'm no longer the same
But what I became does not conflict with from where I cam
I was dealing with caine like cold chilla back when lyricist rained
And dope was killing em, any MC who think they ill as me
Or real as me should chill I mean that's your opinion
But my raps is relentless like a mac with an infra
And I'm back with a vengeance, like Sprewell smashing the Knicks
After they shipped him despite the fans resistance
Big and 'Pac is up top so the nicest man living is right here
Its quite clear like diamonds that glisten
