Aiyyo, make sure y'all turn that water down
Y'all watchin over there?
Is that the Honeymooner marathon?
That shit been on all night right?
Alright

I smell the coke cookin, Dr. Glove with the eagle in the safe
Woodrow the Basehead I surprised him with the first taste
He reached for his pipe, pulled his sleeves up
Told him it was no cut to be careful, he took a hit, Woodrow damn you
His head hit the table, a few rocks fell out his pipe
He's bleedin fatal, he smell like it's so ripe
Told Trife to get him some ice, Raekwon keep your eye on his wife
Tell her to chill, feed her some white
I heard a knock three times, nervous me dropped the raw
Ol' Dirty dropped his straw, he put his fronts back
And snatched up his coke napkin, with thick snots hangin from his nose
Had Woodrow bitch on the floor laughin
Goodness gracious, Tony gosh
Put away the Frosted Flakes, you're killin us
The residue from the last batch we all was straight
Got my son ten spent five, stayed in the house look I lost weight

See that was Crime at the door, he got mad
And I don't give a fuck what he got
Niggas can't keep comin up here, this the spot

Aiyyo Crime you know the spot be bumpin, pardon me
Plus I'm paranoid, and you know the narcs be huntin
Niggas probably think that Starks be frontin
Cause I spazzed out, rolled up in the stashhouse and barked on Justin
Had to size him up for bein on point, stuck now he's fucked
Told him play the window, keep your eyes on that Verizon truck
Every fiend that walk through the door, check if he wired up
No shorts, only give him a play if he buy enough
Cop ten, hit him off with a brand new stem
Our shit is mad potent, one hit they coughin up phlegm
Make sure you get that hundred beans from Pam
She popped shit in front of you daddy? Bet we gon' lace her old man
He came through sellin his TV's
X-Box and PlayStation 3, all we wanted was three
Big Frankenstein holdin his MB's
Socks hangin out, followin me
I'm tryin to hide from the D's, nigga
