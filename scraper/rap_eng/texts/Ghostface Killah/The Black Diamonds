[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Freedom of speech, watch how I reach my potential
I still know hunting for, dope tracks and instrumentals
Travel the world, found black diamonds in the Everglades
Fought Temptations, slap-boxed in The Devil's cage
Globe Trotter, spot-rusher, I bust in your mouth like a Gusher
It's Wu Tang motherfucker!
I ain't mad , I cock My music in the chamber
I'm God's gift; heard I was born in a manger
Danger! Cosmetic face rearrange you
Leave you slumped on the chestboard found by a park ranger
Burst of adrenaline, bungee jump off of the Verrazano
I skydive in some sky-blue Ferragamo's
In the streets heavy, my charms chunky
You damn right I fuck fans
And I keep the munchies

[Verse 2: Roc Marciano]
Loose cannon
Forty-deuce flicks to Paris, way back at the Palace
Like Mike Harris
Callous
Fly nicest, metallic, bang mallets
Fly your whole carriage to Paris
The Black Pat Garrett
Carats on Donna Karens
Guys die trying to drive the McLaren
Islamic, burn chronic out on the terrace
Angelic body lie cold without spirit
My finest hour, you sacrifice to a higher power
Fly from the tower, I fly sour
And buy powder, .40 cal give your pal a shower
You shit in your new Calvin Klein trousers
The night prowler, your life is ours
Knife your Eddie Bauer, leave you
Push up flowers
You ain't counting chip-counters
Niggas is pimps your bitch shouted
The 650 get cloudy

[Verse 3: Killah Sin]
When it comes to beef I don't discriminate
We dudes black and blue, smack on crews
Like they're food, taking space up
On my dinner plate
Depending on my mental state
The mood that I'm in'll make me charge like a bull
Pull the tool out and ventilate you
Sinner taste you down
Make your crown face your frown, full of
Rounds from the pound that detonate when
They penetrate
Tell you always been a snake
You don't move like I do
Imitators hate the fact
That they can't do what I do
I'm mindful of my rivals, I can
Smell em when they slide through
? my arrival, they won't even get a side-view
Won't know that life is over
Til I'm standing right beside you
It's not that I don't like you, motherfuckers
I despise you. The other different pedigree
Not cut from the same cloth, stay G'd up
From the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce
I love it when they tough talk
My guns love to bust off, but every time
I squeeze they call police, they bus me up north
Sinister the finisher, they label me a menace
And got mad when I laughed at the judge
During sentencing, not glorifying prison but
I'm built tough for bidding
It's survival of the fittest shit
I live it every minute every hour to the second
I'm gaining my respect
Never catch the god in the yard
Sharpening the weapons, got shooters
On demand, new recruits for the Clan
Sticking everything moving, more loot for the fam
Ain't a damn thing changed, just say the name, bitch:
Wu Tang
