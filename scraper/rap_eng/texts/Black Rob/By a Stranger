Father dear (I know you wanna touch me)
Well if you hear me (You know you wanna touch me)
I've been.. father dear (You know you wanna kiss me)
Well if you hear me (I want you to kiss me)
I've been.. father dear (I know you wanna fuck me)
Well if you hear me (Why can't you love me?)
I've been held, closely by a stranger

[Verse 1: Labba]
We came to give love to our die hearted real bitches
That stick through they man through the bullshit with
Good loving and good fucking all night long
What makes a young killer feel strong, you know
You went from black thongs to black stem hope, you know
With a lifestyle bigger than door knockers
With a left hand body guard like John Rocker
Kill the cracker, you served pain but that didn't stop ya
Offered the money, gotsta prosper
Blame me for the babies we kill, ain't that ill?
I'm the one who wants to go to hell with it
And I'm acting kinda selfish

[Verse 2: Ilacoin]
She moved above the law, 50 G's in the floor
Type to bring Whitney a key right to her door
Wife of a druglord, living the China white
If you got her high enough, you could fuck her with a stick of dynamite
Tie her up, smack her butt, have your way
I met her Wednesday, had that by Saturday
She was half black, born in Seoul, Korea
Raised in an orphanage, the men would often come to see her
The nuns didn't stop the soldiers from raping her
Which is why she had panic attacks like Kim Bassinger
Months went by, I heard she put base in her stogs
Lit it with a stove, stole all her grace and her soul
I saw it in her face, she was losing control, confusing her role
Her cash flow disintegrated like her ass, yo
She fell victim to the Rotten Apple
Say goodbye to the Porsche, kingpin wants a divorce
She was diagnosed with cancer, heard it from the Source
Now she wonders from, manger to manger, looking to be held

[Verse 3: Black Rob]
Saw me running through, gun inside the face
Goose saw what the struggle do
I mean you act like your fake friends is loving you
They undress in front of me and I'm uncomfortable
Figure I'll just come to you and try to confide
But then I start thinking 'bout the last time you lied
Boo, don't care what you got to hide
What I saw burned my eyes like chloride
All I wanna know is why, I wasn't even tryna spy
Come home dice from Bed-Stuy all inside
Shoulda known, all you did was was pull me down
I shoulda grown, canceled the mortgage on the home
Dead, the diva bust the cellular phone
I let you roam, but now I gotsta leave you alone
Harsh reality is the case, like when you spit in the wind
It might come back in your face
I just came to get my shit, no anger
You was the one kissing a stranger
