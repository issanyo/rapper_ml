[Verse 1: Black Rob]
I remember that day clear, the month and the year
I was hustlin, '89 Downtown in Times Square
With ten niggas, but you recognized the Commander
You went to school and worked part time at Alexander [???]
Chain [???] and kiss on the cheeks
I said some slick shit like, 'we can do this on a beach'
You laughed, straight teeth, mines was all crooky
You walked away but kept turning back, laughin and lookin
I'm gassed, I said Pity she ain't want me to leave
Then she the one, I also waiting to see
Not called you, you called me we on the same tune
I'm Uptown me and June in the game room
I was glad to hear your voice, you choice
Brown sugar, 5'5'' a body was moist
And on top at all, personalities to match
Had a lot in common, yeah we still took it from scratch

Having a couple of drinks, me and you on the [???]
I'm calling quits, cheatin, no matter how you call that shit
My stomach hurtin now, on the pit
And that's nonsense, you told you I was fuckin on tour
Not true, [???]
You know what, boo? I think I showed you too much feelings
I ain't believe when he said you fucked [???] from the building
It's cool-o, I let you kick me in my culo
I ain't coming back now matter how much you scream [???]

[Verse 3: Black Rob]
I admit now, time is hard
Fucked out, I was locked up, you [???]
We missed each other, guess it's so used to you
Everything about the shit that we used to do
It's spice you cookin, you give a nigga real good lovin and
That's why we still snap back, like a rubberband
Another man can't do what I do, I got you
I said the sky is blue and is blue
You fam, you know was better enough you fucked with Scram
Got you actin up for [???], smuggling grams
What you want, ma? Ha, the house or the car?
Yeah I know I'm locked down, but I'm still B.R
