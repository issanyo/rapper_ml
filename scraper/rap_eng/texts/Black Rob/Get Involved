I got hundreds for the ménage
The big house with the 8 car garage
Hurry up and get your drinks from the bar
But holler at Rob if you trying to get involved
I been doing my thing
Since I came home from the swing
I want the money y’all can have the bling bling
Cause diamonds don’t define me and none of y’all design me
Look behind me, phantoms and …
Man I’m used to grinding for chatter, you hate me, whatever
When I was doing bad y’all was happy
Now I got you jumping up and down this bitch like little Scrappy
I hit a chick off now I’m a big pappy
I do it out west then it’s back to …
I get involved wherever I go, always in the after party after the show
Yo, you can say I came back for the dough
Back for the flow, but y’all know it’s worse than the …
Just recognize … hard shit I’m getting involved with
I got hundreds for the ménage
The big house with the 8 car garage
Hurry up and get your drinks from the bar
But holler at Rob if you trying to get involved

When I’m down in Miami all I’m saying is 3 words
Who got birds?
Plus … on 8 mile to whip my swerve
… hotel I got rooms reserved
Sugar land … poke you out of…
Sing the words to my song like karaoke
Album DC, I holler at … she one of them … she stay on a low key
Make them stop… everybody so fresh, styling and profiling
Hit the shot no couple of big fish
Reminds me of Los Angeles nothing but realness
Arizona and Texas, the weed aroma’s the best
Something like Oklahoma Dakota, they on that next shit
They rolling out the black carpet for me
Get out the Maybach and let somebody park it for me
Mc’s … pull up in the tour bus, we love … wanna rush man, get involved
It’s the money that we touch, we stack it and pile up
You stack it and pile up more, get involved
We pushing them big trucks out west rocking the chucks
We dealing with big bucks, man, get involved
Chicks getting … we putting our people on, the song
We getting it on
I got hundreds for the ménage

Hurry up and get your drinks from the bar
But holler at Rob if you trying to get involved

Out in Vegas we up all night
Ain’t hard to find some females to fuck all night
Out in atl the same … all right
… pretty women get down for the right price
Hard know I seen it, Tennessee and Phoenix
I made it rain in Seattle…
Couple players in Cleveland that’s getting cash
I met some real dudes in Hawaii and Boston ..

When it’s time to go to war with them things I’m coming to get ya
And Utah I got some Utah ass
And if you like the way it’s going down then move your ass
