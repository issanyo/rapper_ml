[Intro]
The world ain't no different now
The world ain't no different now

[Verse 1]
Never had a dime, my life a crime
Had to be when I was nine, Moms drunk off wine
Running with all kinds her mind stayed in the stupor
'til the point she paid no mind to the super
Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles
Stayed on the growl and eating once and a while
First day of school never had nothing too style
Mister Colondre stressing, I ain't coming in a while
It was a bummer, rocking the shit I rocked all summer
On the first day, I was feeling some kind of way
And she wasn't trying to do nothing, you would think
For the sake of the kids, she'd enroll in school or something
Now I know then was even harder
'specially for a single mother raising me with no father
Shit living up in this tenement, eating stale Entenmann's
Talking wild shit to Spanish immigrants
I speak in codes, man tú sabe
Always cállate bendición to my madre
Even though she never did nothing for me
Acknowledge me as I run down my life story

[Hook: Cheryl Pepsii Riley & Racquel]
You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried

[Verse 2]
Check the skit, nobody never gave me shit
If anything a nigga framed me and made me get
3 to 6 my first bid, no doubt up in Spofford
Had to be 12 son, trying to make a profit
Remembering robbed my Moms with no guilt
Eating pork and beans, old corn flakes with no milk
Bitter, in school I smacked cats in a hurry
Moms ain't care she busy getting drunk with Mrs. Berry
On the first floor, I used to thirst for greenery
Picking pockets with Seth and Jay from 106th Street
Yo, fuck home, I'm tired of getting punched in my dome
Tired of hearing this faggot-ass nigga moan, I started roaming
My hustle game is deep, cats ya heard
From San Fran back to Manhattan to Newburg
Notorious tell your friends to spread the word
Glorious, my life story is absurd

[Hook: Cheryl Pepsii Riley & Racquel]
You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried
I know I haven’t been the best
I’ve shown you things you shouldn’t have seen
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Oh, my baby

[Verse 3]
Home from Elmira, got a little brighter
I'mma keep it real still a schemer and conniver
Recognize the struggle, living like a thug do
Hatred in my heart but inside I love you
See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you
Knowing that I'm just like you, I am like the double
All I wanna know is how you pound me down
Yo, this shit is real and you really jerked me around
But any way I am getting paid with Puff now
'Bout to cop you a house I can send you some stuff now
So many levels jail take you
I appreciate jail 'cause it made me appreciate you
I've been through fire and brimstone
Used to be diplomas in jail, now I cop the gem stone
I remembered when you rushed me
The time you said you should of flushed me, I forgive you ma trust me

[Hook: Cheryl Pepsii Riley & Racquel]
You don’t know, how crazy it is outside
I’ve died inside so many times
Oh, I’ve cried, oh, I’ve cried
I know I haven’t been the best
I’ve shown you things you shouldn’t have seen
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive me? Oh, my baby
