[Verse 1:] [Black Rob]
Yo
When they see the R (let em know)
I remind them of an ill piranha
Right now
Everybody going bow like Rihanna
Few years
I admit my hands was tied
Certain dudes they wanna see me back inside
I’m a threat
Fuck you and the powers that be
Imma bet
You’ll soon see the power is me
Me
I’ve been everywhere dog
It don’t stop now man
Mad dudes pay homage to Rob
They buss shots
How can I be what New York need
I’m a hustler
The kinda dude that New York breed
And everybody hate New York
But ain’t no way in hell ya’ll can shake New York
So all you haters with the snap on smile
Hallelujah the man be all back on file
And he back with the situation
Diamond the heat maker
And I buss off then go forth
Five peacemaker

[Chorus:]
Mad respect BR
I go home when they see off
Said fuck the whole
I’m on a flight straight to DR
When it’s up to par
And everybody telling me
Dumb down, then screw all
I guess I raised the bar
Most anticipated
Black, he back
Throwing back a few shots of Cognac
Man these high school cats
My whole team can scrap
And if I gotta clap
I’ll take em off the map

[Verse 2:] [Diamond D]
Man I feel like Flav
For all the times I don kissed New York
I’m a fish New York
What is this New York
Heavy everyday
I’m ballin’ up my first New York
Now tell me
Is this what you miss New York
Just know ya’ll in the presence of greatness
Be all icon
I don’t spit that fake shit
But just to be here with ya’ll
I’m so gracious
And this joint won’t sell at Macys
When you see me do my thing
Do my thing
I swing
I’m a one man show
Bernard King
Five O’ think I’m the head honcho
Walk through Bronco like Bilonco
Money talk like your album is
Scratch that
My life on wax
I’m monogamous
Are you sure I’m the one you all problem with
Range Rover
Convertible Truck
Something I gotta get
You telling me just not to shine
Messing with my Al Green
Imma get the grits
So these newcomers
Leave without a pot to piss
And that’s threat the fam
And forces going to stop and frisk

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:] [Black Rob]
Nosy ass local cops
The fun dont stop
50 first
Always with a gun hold block
Been up
Dudes play hard and bend up
Now go rounds
You ain’t hurt
So get up
This shit is unjust
Why you run
Yo gun ain’t buss
I see you
But my thing is
That I don’t trust
Haven’t reached the point
That the mattress
[?] the actress
I do Black Rob backwards
Do Black Rob backwards
Far back
I mean they came through
With them hard cats
And the large gats
And then they came
Crashing through without it
Wanna do crime
But dudes ain’t passionate about it
Most shit I did
Was that hotel garbage
I’m still ill figure regardless
The [?] knew exactly what
I was dropping off
And next time I see
My people was popping off

[Chorus]
