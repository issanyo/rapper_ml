Chorus
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Everybody know that I get money
Never kiss me with no .. honey
I won’t stop beat but my team cross gun it
Holler at dollar is holler at money
Come on Sunny you brought your girl
Walk into the club look dummy
Everybody .. at you look funny
Checking out shorty with an ice on her tummy
My shit bring… she got a whole … I don’t see how
Duch bring wife with a rule tonight
This boy is lied down is eh doing this right
Big talks bottles attract top models
Never bring your chick to the club .. model
I don’t need wify at the crib I got her
All up in the VIP like I just hit the lotto
Chorus
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Best thing that I have this trip plan for weeks
My whole feet trying to move the …first seat
My honey is .. the position is not fun
Got a new bubby in the house we got one
Chicks so – they want me to bring sweet
I beat the regime I leave them with a recipe
My relationships has been as sweet
All are cheating so therefore I cheat
Black chicks white chicks ..
I don’t know how many chicks will follow
I used to . my boy ..i don’t bring sand to the beach
My motto
Chorus
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Have it low when you ..
Your wife won’t be ..
Got off to the sunset
All I am trying to say is leave bubby at home
Don’t tell her where are you going
Turn off your phone glad six feet doctors won’t check up
.. have a good time get of my blessing
Is not fare .. breathing with no air
They want to kick it too even if they don’t see it through
Ask them something they look at you like it’s three of you
You look like what you want me to do
Bringing up the names all a hundred in a random
It’s all a game I don’t bring sand to the beach
And chicks feel the same I know the shit
But I ain’t saying no names with you busy at the bar making it rain
Chorus
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
Don’t bring sand to the beach
