[Verse 1: Del]
Before androids were considered sentient beings
We extended the region
Powerful century
We deploy our infantry
Landed on the planet, switched chaos to simplicity
The Galactic Civil War made us feel like whores
Wondering "what we live life for?"
I was plotting to elimate the admiral
Deltron, well-versed historian and I have no known weakspot
I have heat shield and protection
A group of tribes that are loosely connected
Through the primary language of banging
Establish a foothold but barely maintaining
Part of the overall alliance with the cartel
Right before the central reactor started to melt
I don't bargain with hell-spawn, I'm Deltron
I rendezvous with Diplomats with laser gats
On Mars

[Hook]
Talent supersedes when I be at warp speed

[Verse 2: Del]
The humanoid race feels that they should rule the whole space-time continuum
Decimating villages
Deltron, the hero of alliance is sent forth
To insure chief aids don't catch a heat ray
I just scoped this fiber rope
It looks like a good conductor of electricity
Use it for a stun net for anyone stepping in the vicinity
Living within the walls of our buildings
Impervious surface, industrial strength
Heavy-duty shield generators for hater attempts
Metallic content within the star ship
Computer system shoots us through parsecs
Light years, astronomical units
NASA couldn't fathom the havoc they producing
Measured in fractions involving objects from a single star system but yet so complex

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Del]
The horizon of the observable universe
Too far away for your goons to search
We got music that is truly worth
Occupying your finite time of life
Deltron, to locate me is like driving blind at night
Or diving right into a supermassive black hole, no luminosity
Getting through for eyes to see how I climb so free
Up the cosmic distance ladder
That mediocre chitter-chatter
Will get you shattered
Observations of the transits of Venus
Crucial in the determination of degrees
In astronomical units, the solar system is huge
And space crafts orbit around the sun trying to take cash
Slash lasers back at trigonometric parallax
Appearing to shift slightly from where you at

[Hook]
