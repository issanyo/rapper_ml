[Sample]
That's it John, practice makes perfect

[Intro: Black Rob]
Yeah, man
Okay, let's go

[Chorus: Black Rob]
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya

[Verse 1: Jon Murdock]
I let it jolt, Colt 45 to your throat
Esophagus exposed from the poem that explodes
Like C4 detour, quick from the three-four
Spit, we need to eat more, prepare for the speech war
So Jon laced me, Murdock, not the A-team
I'll Hannibal most of your team if you make me
I'm not impressed what you spit on commercial beats
You hot, I guess that's why your man wants to work with me
I'll merk your team, then send 'em to emergency
Purposely, you irkin' me, I'm watching nervously
Shaky hand style, Newport smoke, inhale, exhale out
Take a breath and let it air out
Circulation circulatin', fuck the work you makin'
I burn the basement while you in the club and perculatin'
R&B style, now prepare for termination
My props is done, yours is in the house and germinatin'
Strangulation occurs, if you hang with hatred
2005, your clique will all bang the 'dation

[Chorus: Black Rob]
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya

[Verse 2: Jon Murdock]
I let it sore, a shot blown from the M4
Kid, I spit raw, yes y'all until the threat's gone
Like a terrorist, out for Americans
Because they stripped their heritage and ain't no one prepared for this
Heavyweight title, fight for the gold belt
A heavy gauge will take your life with a whole shelf
And Zodiac, well brody that, now where's your homie at?
I blow the track, can't hold me back, you fuckers owe me that
Jon's murderous, hot coke and thermoses
Crossed the check point, commas fucked without nervousness
Fuck the words you spit, I really ain't concerned with it
The burners click, verbal shit, I'm staying permanent
You can't erase me, MCs can't faze me
Jon Murdock'll burn your block, explosive lately

[Chorus: Black Rob]
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya
[?] crazy drama
Watch me [?]
[?] bless me, save ya
When I feed the lost ones, he tried to save ya
