Black Rob get the money
With or without yall, I doubt yall
Know I'm punch'n niggas in there mouth ya'll
5 minities niggas wanna require
Understand this BUCK! BUCK! gunfire
Be yourself do wanna be boss
When I come thur with the phat G series
Ya'll niggas step leerie
Knock it off, take my teams motto
Alcohol out the bottle
Live' like we just hit lotto
Bitches do'n their thing
Sip'n Singapore slings
Mercy-less like Ming
Phat diamond rings
Plus drugs
Female thugs
Sip on Gin & Tonic till they vomit
And still driving home from the clubs

It's about playaz max live wires
Riot insightors
Go 10 rounds with real prize fighters
With beef thats deep, throw hunderds..
6 pack
You just throw your panties on the gods stomach
I'm not the boss but I'm the man
I lounge in parts of Japan
Were going on tour with real live bands
I got it off you, Yes the double breast
Keep the vest on my chest
'cause I'n runnin round with the best
Black man
Cop a Lex for my lady
3.25 carats, we talking Ice baby
Ayo chill.....
