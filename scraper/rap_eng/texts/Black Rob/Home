[Intro: Ron G]
It's the mix king Ron G
Brand new from Cormega, featuring Black Rob
Home...

[Verse 1: Black Rob]
I couldn't wait to get home
My flow live like Madden in the zone
That's 10,000 homes daddy
Beep beep the focus ain't changed
Like who controlling the streets
Man this records are leaked
Everybody else spit obsolete
I'll show 'em the agony of defeat
Never wake a bear when he sleep
Cause the first thing that he gon' wanna do is eat
Big stages, I don't give a fuck we there
Fake thugs sticking 'em up like Buckwheat hair
Pour rank man these dudes is franks with sauerkraut
I turn they power out like fam this our house
Daddy, you wanna be the box [?]
Now your chances are slim like clothespins
No gun laws fam I'm holding
We axe all they do is scratch like Logan, y'all

[Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home
Home, home
Home, home

[Verse 2: Cormega]
I couldn't wait to get home
My flow live like Melo in the zone
I am ready to explode
Black Rob and 'Mega
You already is the code
I'm in rare company yet poetically alone
Saying life's a bitch is getting old
If your life ain't in order, seize control
Adversity's a lesson, be composed
Above all spread love hate stains the soul
Those with no purpose are afraid to grow
He who walks in small steps has a way to go
On the road to the riches you exposed to resentment
Everybody wanna eat but they won't do the dishes
My whole view is different since I rose from the benches
The goal was to get it and I showed true persistence (uhh...)

[Chorus]
Home, home
Home, home
Home, home
Home, home
