[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
It's just the same shit different day
We pretend to work while they pretend to pay
Daydreaming all day after day
Every minute, every hour, that im spending awake

[Verse 1: Ghostwridah]
Blue collard green dreams roll it up and blow steam
Clocks ticking, pop's tripping, different day, new scheme
No jobs, rent due when all I got is hope saved
If I fail man, well at least I got this ropes made
Suicide, suicide, someone read that note I left
Im just trying to stay afloat but I can barely hold my breath
Sinking bitch, thinking rich, why should I think otherwise?
We just getting over therefore we are hardly sober
So I think I need a shot, dose of ?, couple of gin
I will pick this fucking lock if you don't let my people in
Not a burglar, simply trying to get that much you stole from us
Tripping acid, pop a pill, and you still cannot roll with us
Fuck you very much of course
Can't wait to show my supervisor when im up in Source
Oh you can't feel my vibe, bitch turn your faders up
They selling dreams, wanna buy but I ain't made enough

[Hook] x2


[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Okay I wake up with this feeling that its the same season
And the world is run now by demons
I got you babe im bleeding
And for no reason baby's heads been spinning on my ceiling
Train spotting, my pains plotting to murder me
The game's rotting im play-calling emergency
This record label thinks the joke cause im broke
And the suits still trying to cope with the fact they never heard of me
Im walking 'round the grocery aisle trying my hardest not to work
I rock a broken smile, the supervisor riding on me with some open file
And getting closer now just trying to hold me down
Im aching and my lazy friend ain't been making ends
This wage is make believe but I ain't here to play pretend
I had enough but you'll never hear me saying when
Ill rewrite anything to never see this day again

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Same shit different day
Twist it up, light it up and watch it fade
I done wrote the book but still im just a play on a stage
Acting out of place, mouse inside a cage chasing cheddar ? rhyme pays
But motherfuckers still insist that its a phase
Even though they honeys know the lyrics to the throw aways
I ain't the type to rain on no parade
So I let em hate if that's the type of shit that'll put smiles up on they face
Pace car, burnt star in a bar
Down and out gutter rats splitting packs of 'gars
Anyway and every way even after restart
When they open up the books we gon' get a chapter on secret arts
This deja vu all over again this time I called some friends
Flipped the beat, added some strings
Before the haters come and get me I hope they get me some spins
Maybe Cee Lo on the hook with a beat that's catchy as shit

(Wait, ain't that what we just did? I swear to god this is groundhog day
Keeps repeating and repeating and repeating
When will this day end? I don't know just bring the present in)

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
Oh shit, feces, turds
My words are absurd
I blame it on the herb when I got the urge to splurge
I just splurge with the nerds put my dick up in your ear like
Fuck what ya heard!
Im a motherfucking hip hop, rock star narley
Puffing on that Marley, cruising in a Harley
Ziggy when I get jiggy
Mobster, shota, roster, choppa, pop ya, blocka
Hello there momma ill be your big poppa
Christopher Wallace pissing on a pilot
Kicked off the plane, I admit it im deranged
Mack Maine is so lame that Cypress Hill should be my name because im
Insane in the membrane
Politically incorrect nympho im into sex
1,2 mic check
Love alcoholic, no phone I can't call it
Same shit different toilet
Mr. Green
