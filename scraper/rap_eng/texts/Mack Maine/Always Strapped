[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yessir! Check me out, look

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unorthodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got it covered like a coke top
Okay?

[Hook]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm
Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

[Verse 2: Mack Maine:]
I'm Mack Maine, hey
Hey, to a man with a ho with some pop trunk
I fuck over you like I'm sexin' on the top bunk
I make alot of noise, boy, like a cop car
The whip got the dicks out like a pop bra
And you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams
The new hip-hop landlord I'm 'bout to buy the buildin'
And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back, yessir!

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Yeah shawty, the last MOB
Flyin' the Bugatti with the tool on the seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blaze
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the young 'un when we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes and the new Merced'
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay
Uptown made man out the hallway
Crab in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way
I thought they knew shawty, Like Father Like Son
Ball till you fall, stuntin' wit them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eat steaks
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday
We grind for the shine, nigga, gettin' big money
Got a fleet tossin' chicken, nigga, get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface
I'm in the Impala droptop, chunky
Ice man birdman rockin' red monkeys
Already, nigga, neighborhood superstar
And  we gon' ball til we fall

[Hook]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
