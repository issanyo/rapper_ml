Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore

[Verse 1:]
Shit! It seems like yesterday I was only five
And my mom used to put out my clothes to get shavvin
These days I gotta get dressed myself
But let me go back in time, like Michael J myself
Well, my moms was a fox, she's still a fox
But my sister grew up, she took her spot as the fox
But it still was all good
My dad used to work all the time, he was rarely home
Sing this song
You see, uh I used just to watch cartoons
Back then my homies didn't have war wounds
You fast forward a little, older when I got
A lot of my homies see that they all got shot
But I remember the days, I remember the times
When we used to listen Eric B and Rakim for rhymes
And we used to shoot ball at the park everyday
But now things changed, I'm on my way, see
I'm on my way, see

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, you see, I used to like snack time
And pre-kid I used to like when it was nap time
I used to get my mat out
Chyeah I remember when we used to have to do math like one plus one equals two?
I remember when I learned my A, B, Cs
And my one, two, threes, it was just so eased
And my dad sat me down
And he taught me about the birds and the bees
Then I used to bring home bees
And then I started bringing home seeds
Even brought home dees and I saw the way
That my mom used to cry when I brought home the dees
So I got up on my GOB
And I used to shine like the sun
And I used to sip on Capris
I used to like the gummy bears
And I used to like the fruit gushes
And I used to get snowballs with rome
But fast forward I used to watch The Flintstones
But it's funny how time go and my homie long gone, but uh

[Verse 3:]
Remember your first kiss
And your first girl that you really made love with?
That was the shit
Remember how you used to need her fit for the dance?
You was running around trying to get something for the homecoming
Then you went to your prom
See that was just your time, that was your time to shine
Now everybody trying to work on their 10 years anniversaries
And half of your homies stay up in the hearse you see
Remember the "rest in peace" T-shirts and the second line
Hardy hard a lot of smiles when we was at that Marti Grass
Chicks was trying to get the bees
I remember back in the day
When you ain't had to worry about trying to worry about feeding yourself
Now you feed your seed and you're getting what you need
You can't get what you want
You used to have an allowance, you used to watch TV
Hot day during the summer man back in the days
Plan back in the days, you know
I remember back in the days, let's go

[Hook:]
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore, anymore

[Outro:]
Grown up huh? You know
I wish I could hop in the same time
Machine, that Michael J Fox got in it
And go back in the days
I ain't really had to worry bout nothing
Peanut butter & jelly sandwiches
You know, lil debby cakes
Put your lil uniform on girl let's do it, that's it
I'm a 80's baby
It wasn't really that hard to please moms and pops
I love the 90's too
Remember they had too much to worry bout
That's what it used to be like
Girls was uh
Sometime I still wish I was like girls is uh
But love licks, and a nigga really got turned up you know
Mack Maine's a ay
Back in the days, back in back in back in the days
When I was young, I'm not a kid say
Back in the days, see I remember way back in the days
When all my homies they was kids
I wish that we could really be kids again
I wish that we could really be friends again
I miss my homies, I just wish that, I just wish that...
