[Intro: Lil B]
And she's a very freaky girl
A very freaky girl, a very freaky girl, a very freaky girl...
(But let me tell you somethin')

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Me and my niggas pop bands at the strip club
(Why?) Cause I gotta get my dick sucked
Bitch get money, stacks on cake
Ass on deck, racks on face
SS bitch, put the mask on face
Black on black, put the cash on face
Bitch get chirr, Too $hort taught me game
I'm in the fuckin' game, I'm rollin' like a train
New school vamp, niggas know I'm the mane
Based boys clique bitch, rats on chains
Rats on ass bitch, tinted up rings
Rats on ass with the tinted up Range

[Hook: Lil B]
Ass on deck, ass on deck (Biyaaaaatch)
Ass on deck, ass on deck (Biyaaaaatch)
Ass on deck, ass on deck (Biyaaaaatch)
Ass on deck, ass on deck (Biyaaaaatch)
Got the golden ticket, I'mma pop the mag on her
Got the golden ticket, I'mma pop the mag on her
Got the golden ticket, I'mma pop the mag on her
Got the golden ticket, I'mma pop the mag on her

[Verse 2: Lil B]
Bitch got loose cause I got her off the matrix
(Why?) Because I'm cleaner than my Asics
Genuine, bitch I'm so anxious
Pack flicks, a full presentation
Thick bitch, thicker than the nation
Don't drive, I don't got no patience
Put me on, bitch I'm motivation
Spend money, I don't got no patience
Ill get it, faster than the ski slopes
Real niggas don't look through the peephole
Where he go, a little does he know
Where he go, a little does he know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Pimp tight, pussy popper, paper getter
Good pussy pusher, discount giver, the gold digger
They know my name from New Orleans to O-Town
If you hear I'm showin' up
This how it go down
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
Walk in the club, keepin' it crackin', nigga what's happenin'
I see them hoes, shakin' that ass, they 'bout that action
Them niggas they laughin', they spendin' that money
My bitches ain't laughin', cause they nothin' for me
Ain't nothin' that them hoes gonna get from me
They give to me, you should get like me
I know your wifey, she probably like me
I call that ho Drano, she be suckin' my pipe-y
She love the nigga, yeah you can tell
I ain't fuckin' the ho, if the pussy smell
Is that a damager? You can ask Tamara
I tell a ho with dick-sucking talent, "I'll be your manager"
Put her on a track, and I ain't talkin' rap
Don't bring your ass home, until you got my stacks
Too $hort, Lil B and Mack, we don't play by the book
If your ankle hurt hop on your good foot bitch and keep that

[Hook]

[Outro: Mack Maine]
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I said, bitch I'm Mack Maine
I said, bitch I'm Mack Maine
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
I got hoes all on the bunny ranch boy
I got hoes all on the bunny ranch boy
I got hoes all on the bunny ranch boy
I got hoes all on the bunny ranch boy
