(Intro)
You see
Every hustler gotta story to tell
I know I do
You see everybody think they got what it take to make it
A lot of niggas won't make it, huh we made it
It's that rich gang shit, that YMCMB shit
That get rich or get wealthy shit
Ainâ€™t no other option for the mob nigga
Lil' nigga doe

(Verse: 1)
Now I'm clutching on my toast
While I'm ridin' in my ghost and I'm puffing Cali smoke
While I'm headed to the boat
Got two bad chicks with me I'm bout to fuck 'em both
I remember when I was broke man I couldn't fuck a ho
YMCMB dog you know I took a oath
I'm getting bread by the loaf and I get greeted like a pope
That Louie V purse ain't the only thing she toke
So you better use caution when you approach
Stay in line nigga ain't no need to encroach
Break your legs player and have you running to your coach
I need to feel some fingers since God got a hand
And what's a calender when they say God's got a plan
I already know what's part of your tradition and it's part of your religion
When you brought up in conditions that's considered hard to live in
So you're addicted to the paper
And I ain't treach homie, but I'm naughty by nature
And niggas try to erase you like you was born a mistake
And haters be like slow down on the gas, pump your brakes
Them niggas that are fake I leave them floating up a lake
Mow the lawn for the snakes, set a trap for the mice
I've been heavy on the dice
I only sleep on my flights
My baby needs shoes, and my momma need lights
And my hommie got life, man in jail he got left
So he lost all his rights
Now all I could do was just write
Tell him that he ain't dead yet
He can live through me, and back to this crazy world
He can give through me
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, I'mma keep flossing
And since life is a marathon, I'mma run it for Boston
I'm in the garden, bumping up the best of Marvin
Food for thought for you niggas starving
Up until then, I'mma be duckin' behind the project buildin'
Smoking that fire we with the ghetto children
Plotting on a way that we can make a million, million, lord
Up until then, I'mma be duckin' behind the project buildin'
Smoking that fire we with the ghetto children
Plotting on a way that we can make a million, million, lord
Up until then
Up until then
Up until then, lord
Up until then
Up until then
Up until then, lord
