[Intro]

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Said She Know She Bad When She Walk Up In The Club
And The DJ Start Playing Her Song
And She Know When She Bad When She Call Me On My Phone
And I Catch My First Flight Back Home
Cause Baby I Need It Cause Shawty Is A Killa
And I'm That Nigga You Better Believe It
From The Bed To The Floor
Never Scared We Can Go
Just Let Me Know What You Want

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Shawty Over There Looking So Hot
Got Me Dreaming Of Us Leaving Heading Right To My Spot
Gotta Open Up The [?] Cause You She Gonna Pop
Tell Me What It's Gonna Be Tonight
And I Know That You Feel The Same
So Let's Go Why You Playing Games?
Sloow It's How I'm Doing Things
So Tell Me What You Waiting For?

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Said She Know She Bad When She Walk Up In The Club
And The DJ Start Playing Her Song
And She Know When She Bad When She Call Me On My Phone
And I Catch My First Flight Back Home
Cause Baby I Need It Cause Shawty Is A Killa
And I'm That Nigga You Better Believe It
From The Bed To The Floor

And I'm That Nigga You Better Believe It

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Yea Girl I Wish We Were Siamese Twins So we Could Spend our Life Together
And I'm a Only Tell You Once Or Maybe Two Or Three Times
That You Could Be My Wife Forever See I Know You Used To Like Girls Now You're A Ex Dyke
Pussy So Good I Pray For It In The Next life
Carl Pockia Like We Coming To Your Next Fight
If You Miss Me Too Much I'll Get You On The Next Flight
The Only Time You're In Coach Is When You Look For Bags
[?] On The Plane You In First Class
Hair Gang So Insane She Need A Straightjacket
Baby Tell Me What You Think I'll Be Your Shrink
[?]
Ain't Tricking If I Ain't Got It I'll Put Grands in Your Hands
The Gold Is Your Heart I'm A Man With A Plan
See You're A Superstar I'm Your Number One Fan
I'm Trying To Cuff You Put You In A Headlock
Young Money Girl I Could Make Your Bedrock
I'll Be Your Fred Flinstone Be My Wilma
You Platinum In My Eyes Them Other Bitches Just Silver
I'm Feeling Like A Kid Again On You I Got A Crush
I'm Trying To Make Your Heart Smile And Your Soul Blush
I'm Trying To Be Your N.I.2G.A So We Can Make Love And Smoke Weed All Day

[Chorus/Outro: Lloyd]
Said She Know She Bad When She Walk Up In The Club
And The DJ Start Playing Her Song
And She Know When She Bad When She Call Me On My Phone
And I Catch My First Flight Back Home
Cause Baby I Need It Cause Shawty Is A Killa
And I'm That Nigga You Better Believe It
From The Bed To The Floor
Never Scared We Can Go
