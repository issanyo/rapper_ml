[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Look, Rockwilder on the beat
1-7 in your face
Mack Maine, you my nigga
Cash Money, what's up?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Check me out
Young Money motherfucker, where the cash at?
I put numbers on your head like a class hat
See I done been through every thing like a lab rat
Can you swim cause you sleepin' where the crabs at
I stand before you bitch niggas with the fifth cocked
Damn, you can hear a pin drop
Bulletproof vests cannot defend tops
Wanna walk in my shoes, you need ten socks
But these niggas is actors like Rick Fox
Stick to the script or fuck around and get written out
We in this motherfucker, throwin' up the set
G4 boys, throw 'em off the jet

[Hook: Lil Wayne (x2)]
And me and Mack is two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
See I'm the young lion and he the young bull
Welcome to the zoo, you are in the zoo

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Warnin', Mack on the dollar hunt
I'm feelin' real slick bitch, I got my collars up
Spread the word boy, I keep the kush bottled up
.40 cal pal, you can get hollowed up
If you ain't talkin' 'bout money homie, than that's cheap chatter
I'm pissin' on the game, feel like I got a weak bladder
And y'all fallin off, y'all climbin' up a weak ladder
And I'm too high to try to reach you son
I rock shows every day with Miss Cita's son
Then I'm uptown baby like I'm Peter Gunz
And Lord Tariq to the lord I speak
I got game, I got a veggie tryin' to eat my meat, naw

[Hook: Mack Maine (x2)]
Me and Tune is two niggas from the same hood
Fell from the same tree cut from the same wool
He a young lion, and I'm a young bull
Welcome to the zoo, you are in the zoo

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & (Mack Maine)]
Now bring it back to Hollygrove, yeah Hollygrove
Around park had work by the slidin' boards
(Around park, you get murked by the slidin' boards)
(17th ward animals and dinosaurs)
Tyrannosaurs Rex test me
It's M.O.B. 'til the mortician dress me
(And that's deep, you run up on Eagle Street)
(Belfast and Monroe be right at your front door)
Knock knock, hello, there goes several fellows
With clips to the elbows, hell rose
(And tell them niggas he was hustlin' 'til hell froze)
(Hollygrove ain't no motherfuckin' Melrose)
Hollywood ain't no motherfuckin' Hollygrove
And they can find your ass Monday in your Friday clothes
(Or they can find you part dead on Father's Day)
(Hollygrove, U.S.A. where Maine and Carter stay)
