[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, don't knock it ‘cause you can't stop it
Your woman done jumped out of pocket
Looking at my rings and my watch
She so off the chain, somebody call the locksmith
Shit, that’s your girl? You’d better get her, mane
Before I leave out this motherfucker with her mane
One minute y’all was kissin’, takin’ pictures mane
Next she forgot that she was even with you, mane
Damn, y'all was a cute couple
Just because I hit that don't mean that she don't love you
Hate to bring trouble to your world
But the Hot Spitta’ll quick duffle bag your girl
I didn't even try, ‘cause she was in the club, fuckin’ me with her eyes
I get her to the crib, she fucking me and my guys
She ain't gonna leave ‘till me and my niggas tired

[Hook: Curren$y]
Yeah, she must like something I'm doing
She having thoughts of us screwing
She got a boyfriend, she right next to him
But every time he turn his back, she looking
Every time he turn his back, she looking
Every time he turn his back, she looking
Every time he turn his back, she looking
Every time he turn his back, she looking

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
Yeah - boo snatcher, happy home breaker-upper
Homeboy, I make life tougher
For Simpson, fake pimps and handcuffers
Type of niggas that smash once and say they love her
Haha - I laugh at y'all
Go ahead and wife the freak, I ain't mad at y’all
See I don't know if you ain't handlin’ your biz
But if looks was sex, me and your girl done had some kids
And no, this ain't a joke, and no this ain't a riddle
But homie, look, you gettin’ played something like a fiddle
Bet your man can’t do it like this, uh uh
He can’t work the middle, ‘cause his thing too little
You see, I've been diagnosed with Realnigganittis
And no I ain't a Spartan but she call me Leonidas
It's funny how I used to just chill on Lee Anders
My first girlfriend, see her first name was Candace
We used to chill and play the cut like a praying mantis
But you know how love go, it don’t go how you planned it
She used to love me high, she used to love me sober
Now she probably somewhere with a counterfeit Casanova
Damn - you could've had a mack, baby girl
Oh, Casanova
Yeah – Spitta, bring the hook in, let's go
