Curren$y, the hot the spitta flow outrageous, making haters sick
So I guess that I'm contagious, why would you uncage this beast that lies within a peaceful guy, who just trying to get by
Occasionally I'm high, shit you got to feel me man! you niggas is under me I'm fucking ceiling fan
You got to look up to me, divas calling my label they tryna hook up with me
Young money motherfucker I'm more than a company and if a nigga come for me
Heater slow em' down like that shit weezy keeping in the Styrofoam cup yea!
And your boo heard my verse on that carter 2 I got my grown man on and now she wanna fuck
Straight cooking that pure cokeezy, got fiends going crazy like them dope boys do when they hear that new jeezy this shit too easy!

See when my team start to blitz you, ya bitch you, shit john stockton could even much assist you
See y'all ain't play with magic y'all ain't worthy, I'm a throwback nigga! you's a swing-man jersey
Let's say my dough low, I'm a move in slow mo and Pistol Pete your chest with a all black four four
Or I might send a bitch at ya named coco to knock at ya front door, murk ya on the low low
See coco will catch you sipping hot coco, you'll be hollering coco I don't want it no more
See I was taught not to be an average joe blow, my flow ain't so so and I don't talk to po po's

When your mom was dressing ya ass in polo, my money stayed up like I feed my pockets no doz, mack!
