[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Hahaa, yeah
Young Weezy Baby
Come to tell you all today about a lil’ problem I be having, oh man see its like…

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
When I’m down in the studio tryna make a track
My girl be at home all over my back
And every time I say that’s what I’m doing
She don’t think it’s what I’m doing
When its her that I’d rather be doing
But right now I’m in the studio making this track
My girl at home all over my back
She blowin’ up my phone
She tells me she’s alone
I say I won’t be long, let me finish this song
But right now I’m in the studio eating this track
My girl at home begging me to come back
Okay I’m coming home, and when I get home
Girl I’m gonna kill it like I’m killing this song
But right now I’m in the studio

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Man just record me
And even with a equals sign you couldn’t pause me
Haha
Yeah, this is the office
Come be my secretary baby this is the office
And my office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10
I’mma say it again
My office hours are 9 to 5
But you can be my 6 to 10

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2 - T-Streets]
Man just record me
My girl at home all discombodied
Lady, but baby I’m just recording
And you gotta know I’d rather do this than party
Man, don’t get me started
You think I’m crazy, my bitch retarded
But that’s my bitch regardless
Yeah

[Hook - Lil Wayne]

[Verse 3 - Mack Maine]
Man, just record your boy
If I sound a lil’ pissed, disregard ya boy
My baby girl really acting like a baby sending text
Stressed, tryna make it hard for ya boy
I’m like shawty better use your toy
See a nigga never absent but I might be taughty
Lordy, Lordy, I likes to party
See I could be with two freaks about to have an orgy
Or I could be with Pamela, could be with Audrey
Instead I’m telling the engineer: “dude just record me”
And as soon as Angel records me
That’s more Gucci, more Prada, more Louie V
See every verse bring us closer to our dream house
Now we closer to the things that we dream ’bout
And when I get home I ain’t tryna go to sleep
You know I’mma dig deep but right now I’m OT in the studio

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
