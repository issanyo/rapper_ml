[Intro: Mack Maine]
Cool and Dre

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pull up on ‘em bitches, get out, walk
Way to many holes, like I play golf
She’s somewhere in Wayne’s world, stranded, lost
Bitch catchin' feelin’s like Randy, Moss
Young Money shit, got the bathroom door locked
Tune go hard, y’all softer than my car top
Hank Gathers, I’ma ball til my heart stop
Nice red bone in a thong and a bra top
Lookin' for a queen from a king-size bed
I can make that pussy stand up and drop dead
Fuckin’ with Lil Tune then a nigga get murked
A nigga get kilt like a muthafuckin' skirt
I do it like Nike, I’m psychic I knew you like it
Run up in ya ass, than I dash like a hyphen
This is priceless, not for sale
And I unveil, Ms. Shanell

[Hook: Shanell]
The feeling of your arms around me
I swear that I can’t get enough
I’m staying up all night, wishing you were here with me
And when I’m with my girls
They trippin’ cause it won’t be long
Before you have me rushing home

Cause, boy you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

And when ya gone too long
I’m waiting with your T-shirt on
Playing love songs

You make me feel good
You tell me love is crazy
I guess that we are too
There ain't a thing I won’t do to prove that I’ll be here for you

[Verse 2: Drake]
You know I wake up like a king, get up, stunt
Take advantage of the day, this shit won't happen more than once
Know I’m ready for whatever, ready for the action
I’m still focused on my shit but girl I’m up for a distraction
Got a body like a stripper, but tell me she a student
But some strippers are students, so I tell her ass to prove it
Ya know, yeah show me all your books and some id or somethin'
I just wanna know that you can teach me somethin'

[Hook: Shanell]
Boy, you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo
Cause Im dedicating this to you

Baby our song is on the radio
Our song is on the radio (so turn it up)
Turn it up on your stereo
Cause Im dedicating this to you

Boy, you’re everything I need
I don’t wanna see you leave
I got time if you got me
Don’t you know you make it feel
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
So good, good, good
Soooo gooood
