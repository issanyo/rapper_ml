Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean
The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen
Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either
And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper

She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye

(Yeah, born rich, yup)
Gucci bag poppin' tags
New crib brand new jag
Birdman born to shine

Bad bitch all the time, stay fly, ride fly
I'm stuntin', stay high
Straight G, just like that
Blow 100, bounce right back

Red hot, hard top
Cash money, hard knock
Bentley frame, drop top
50 G's, the bottles pop

Iced out, so we chill
Tunin' up every automobile
Tatted up, life of a G
Counting stacks and five star suits

Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean
The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen
Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either
And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper

She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye

(Yeah, yeah)
250 on the dash, yeah, I'm livin' fast
Yeah, I'm gettin' cash, I need a bitch that's bad
Shawty play your role, we slammin' phantom doors
She be like drive slow, we burnin' purple smoke

I said I'd never fold, I promise not to stop
Just like my rolls Royce, the way that girl drop
I need a hot girl, the way the girl hot
Dollar signs tatted on her on her private flight

Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean
The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen
Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either
And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper

She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye

I wanna be all over your body like it was Miami with tattoos
Baby, I have to, I ain't playin'
And I needa some good girl in front of me baby
You drivin' me crazy, yeah

Yeah, she got it written on her, her swag on lean
The way she dancin' on me, can tell that she a queen
Her mama wouldn't like it, her daddy wouldn't either
And the way she grindin' on me, you can tell shawty's a keeper

She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
She got it written on her, aye, aye, aye, aye
