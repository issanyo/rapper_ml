[Chorus: T-Pain]
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Money to blow, I’m limpin' off tour
Boatloads of cash, bitch, I’m overboard
I got money for these whores if you open up the door
Company accounts and they all on one accord
Real talk, I don’t speak, even if it’s “Hi, hater”
I’m on top and I done locked the elevator
All these bitches say I'm fly and I can never touch the ground
I’m not tryna be in your circle cause I don’t fuck around
I get that money, that money (money)
I live it, I want it (want it)
Drop the top on that Ferrari, now I’m in California
I let the hardtop down and the wind blow through
All I do is win, what the fuck you gon' do?
I'm good, good, good and
I do this for my hood, hood, hood
Yeah, and ain't nobody gonna stop me I doing it right now
So bang, bang, pow, pow, everybody say

[Chorus: T-Pain]
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I go so hard they call me go so hard
You ain't a king, you a joker card
Fuckin’ up the Church money like a alter boy
I got them yellow Xannies, that's them Tonka toys
I go bonkers, boy, I put that on my mamma nem
These hoes are all alike, they put the 'ho' in homonym
I think all these niggas sound like me, that’s a compliment
I told a midget "Bitch, I do it big, hippopotamus"
Put that on my Slime and ‘em, no b-ball, we stop and pop
No b-ball, we got shit locked, swagger ill, wassup, doc?
Make that pussy pop like the gun I went to jail for
Shoot the doors off that Jeep, that bitch look like a mail truck
Ya pussy, keep ya tail tucked, real niggas in this bitch
Get that pussy wet, fuck her than I jet, Kenny Smith
T-Pain voice, all I do is win and shit
Young Money in ya muthafuckin’ face, blemishes

[Chorus: T-Pain]
My money right (my money, money), my bread good (good, good)
Shawty fuckin’ (wassup, girl?), that head good!
Bang, bang, pow, pow
I do my thang, thang, look at me now, now
My money right (my money, money), my cash up (up up and away)
Face down (face down), ass up
I rep my town, town, that’s where I’m from, from
So, nigga, pow, pow, bum, bum
