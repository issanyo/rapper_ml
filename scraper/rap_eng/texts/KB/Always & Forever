[Intro: Christon Gray & Tasha Catour]
I can't imagine no one else right here with me
You got the magic potion scent all over me
Girl we got something special
Take me to my knees when I see you
When I see you
Oh, boy, it ain't nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you want babe, want babe
It's on me
Oh, boy, it ain't nothin', nothin', it ain't nothin'
I put that on me
I put that on me
Forever

[Verse 1: KB]
(K to the second letter)
To my summertime fine
Sublime mind, you're fine wine
Kind eye, shine wild, let me drive by
My kind, my, my
Defy time, I'd die fine knowin' on my side you're here with me
And as long as I live
You got both eye lenses, got 25 kids (I'm jokin')
But I love the way you mother's the dopest
No hocus pocus, a lot of focus to biblical women
Now, spark the romance, got my heart on demand
I pull over, let's park and slow dance
How far, let's advance
Let the divorce hit the fan
I leave you when the Lord leaves your man
That's...

[Hook: J. Paul, KB and Tasha Catour]
Always
Always and forever
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Always
Always and forever
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

[Verse 2: KB]
I don't know what tomorrow holds
But I know who holds tomorrow
I wanna be with you forever
But I know this marriage is borrowed
I'ma give it back, give it back
Remember that I presented that
At the throne that He be sittin' at
Only little acts and the grand drama divine
Let the world all see how He loves His bride
Listen, bad girls ain't no good
And the good girls ain't no fun
Girl, you ain't either the one
Your identity is soaked in the sun

[Pre-Hook]
I can't imagine no one else right here with me
You got the magic potion scent all over me
Girl we got somethin' special
Take me to my knees When I see you
When I see you
Let me love you...

[Hook]
Always
Always and forever
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Always
Always and forever
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

[Bridge: Tasha Catour]
Why don't you come with me?
Forever 'til the end of time
Why don't you come with me?
Forever you'll be mine

[Hook] (x2)
Always
Always and forever
Don't hold back, don't hold back
Always
Always and forever
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
I say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go

[Break: J. Paul]
Say, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go
Say, don't let go, don't let go
Always and forever, ever
Forever, ever?
Forever, ever
Always and forever, ever

[Outro]
Always
Always and forever
Always and forever
Forever
I can't imagine no one else right here with me
You got the magic potion scent all over me
Girl we got something special
Take me to my knees when I see you
