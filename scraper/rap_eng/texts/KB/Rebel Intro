[Verse: Sarah Reeves]
Tell 'em bring the guns out
Send my city up in flames
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
My hope still remains
Whether dead or alive
This is do or die
And Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight we fight for our King
Tell 'em bring the guns out
Send my city up in flames (flames)
And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
My hope still remains
Whether dead or alive
This is do or die
And Christ is the gain
So raise your torches up high
Tonight is Rebel Rebel 88
