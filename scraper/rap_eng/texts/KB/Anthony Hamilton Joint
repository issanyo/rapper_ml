[Chorus: G-Haze]
Give me one chance to make
Gotta make you make your body wet
Gotta make you make you say my name
Gotta make you make your body sweat
Gotta make you sweat, make you say my name

[Verse 1: Millz Davis]
It's funny how I understand life now
It's better that I never think twice now
All I need is for a girl to give me one chance
And like Drake said, I need one dance
Slow jams, soundtrack to romance
This a juke jam like I know Chance
I'mma make your cheeks do the sun dance
And get it on film like Sundance
Themed out Retro '80s
I won't stop 'til I get me a Mercedes
My new girl ridin' on safety
We go to war like military navy
She enlisted and I recluted
I'm the champ, undisputed
I don't question, I just do it
No talk, straight to it
Give her one more chance on her Faith Evans
'Cause this right here is a notorious
I'm blessed and victorious
I'm glad that I have you unfurtunate
Niggas want what I have, that's unfortunate
My life is a line raised by the unfortunate
Plus the love came free, not to extorsion it
It took me one time and now it's over with
These rappers not to play like Hamilton, but I had to use Anthony for the sampling
I wrote a dice for a chance, that's gambling
Because she loves my black-ish Anthony Anderson

[Chorus: G-Haze]
Give me one chance to make
Gotta make you make your body wet
Gotta make you make you say my name
Gotta make you make your body sweat
Gotta make you sweat, make you say my name

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me, Charlene
