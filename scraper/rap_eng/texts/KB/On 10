Yeah ooh, Yeah this K homie
HGA, take it that way homie
I've been on ten for a decade homie
Me and bae courtside like a Nets game homie
Who is that with the tack and a fresh name on him
Going to bat for the cats that you laugh at homie
Spit a dash on the track
This is AK homie
With immaculate facts for His namesake only
Holy solely only rolling lowkey
Kobe on me homie, don't be nosey
Obi-Wan Kenobi in my Roshe's
I don't want a Rollie, I am so Cheap
Rather dip my chips in underprivileged
Giveaway like I could pick a winner
Gary Vee is not a mentor in here
But you'd think he was by how we livin'
Oh yuh Rep gang uh
Please don't call me faith-based
Cause all of this mug is Yahweh
All of us up like all day yuh
Rep gang, rep gang, rep gang, ooh
Truth radiate like X-ray, ooh
Squad locked in like French braid, ooh

Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Ty Brasel]
Oh yeah, it's the kid
But they already know who that is
Smash the dash in, I'm on 10
Yeah I'm back in Shine with excellence
Yeah my essence uh huh I been balling playmaking
Big shot since conception
Pull up and wreck it, I show up, do damage
Bounce back, recession
Don't slow up go legend
Young Vick at Virginia Tech no capping
Making big time plays, Lamar Jackson
It's young t from the south with the accent
Yeah young 01 lyric assassin
I'm Back, running the track like a 40 dash, yeah for the passion
KB told me write free on your casket I ain't got no chains, that's everlasting
Oh yeah, look man
You can't stop what God planned I see all the hatred
But I'm gone shine regardless
On the runway I hit space go galactic
I'm back on 10 so, bring the hook back in
