[Pre-Chorus: KB]
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em go off in the zone
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em go off in the zone

[Verse 1: KB]
Okay I’m in here so what’s up now? End zone like touchdown
KB and I’m dressed out and I won’t move like tough crowds
Seven years I done stuck out got death threats, pushed down
But how they ‘posed to hurt a man that’s been dead since ‘05?
Beat drop and I’m goin’ in, preach so hard that you know it’s him
He fills me up and then he pours (pores), this might go underneath yo skin
I promise dawg I’m on it (ha) to the praise of his glory, homie
I’ma get it in, no woulda or coulda been but fully be full of him, I’m hungry homie

[Chorus: Chris Lee Cobbins]
‘Cause I’ve got tunnel vision, yeah I’m focused on the light (he’s with me)
Can’t see a thang ‘cause I’m focused on the Christ (come with me)
You can try to kill me but you can’t hurt me
You can bring whoever you want, want
You’ll never break me, won’t penetrate
Once I get off in my zone, zone yeah
I’m in my zone, I-I-I-I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
I’m zonin’ out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out
(I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out

[Verse 2: KB]
Hey, don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
I ain’t dissin’ Oprah, but I’m never on my own
Well let me say this, I’ma live forever regardless how my doctor feels (Dr. Phil)
Call it Willow Smith, my Father’s will
I’ve seen the Lord, the same I’ll never be
Some say they’ve seen the Lord but live on casually
I don’t know what-what you saw but the Lord ain’t what you seen
Once you really seen the Lord, you’re obsessed with what you see
Obsession boy that’s said right, love him more than dear life
Wanna know how you can beat porn? Let him give you new web sight (website)
I promise dawg I want him (ah), mind set on his glory
I visualize him crucified both hands wide 3:45

[Chorus: Chris Lee Cobbins]
‘Cause I’ve got tunnel vision, yeah I’m focused on the light (he’s with me)
Can’t see a thang ‘cause I’m focused on the Christ (come with me)
You can try to kill me but you can’t hurt me
You can bring whoever you want, want
You’ll never break me, won’t penetrate
Once I get off in my zone, zone yeah
I’m in my zone, I-I-I-I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
I’m zonin’ out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out
(I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out

[Post-Chorus: KB]
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em go off in the zone
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Zone, out
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em
Black out on ‘em go off in the zone
