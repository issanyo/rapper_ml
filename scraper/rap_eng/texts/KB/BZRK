[Intro: Family Force 5]
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
Go berzerk, go berzerk

[Verse 1: Family Force 5]
Hyped up on adrenaline, feelin’ like a kid again
But then again
It’s a win, win, win again
So genuine, oh, so genuine
Pop, pop, pop like a firecracker
Crack that back like a chiropractor (oh)
I go berserk on a daily basis
Y’all recognize me? I’m meltin’ faces
B-Z-R-K
Gonna get your heart rate
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
B-Z-R-K
Gonna get your heart rate
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky

[Bridge: Family Force 5]
B-Z-R-K, goin’ out of control (out of control)
We are that FF5, goin' digital gold (digital gold)

[Hook: Family Force 5 & (KB)]
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K (I want every one to say go berserk)
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K (everyone tell me to go berserk)
Go berzerk, go berzerk
Go berzerk, go berzerk

[Verse 2: Family Force 5]
Somebody call that fire department, flames turned up at my apartment
Gotta stop drop ‘cause it’s gettin' hot
Yeah it’s gettin’ hot, hot
B-Z-R-K
Gonna get your heart rate
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
B-Z-R-K
Gonna get your heart rate
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky
Up to the sky, up-up to the sky

[Bridge: Family Force 5]
B-Z-R-K, goin’ out of control (out of control)
We are that FF5, goin' digital gold (digital gold)

[Hook: Family Force 5 & (KB)]
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K (I want every one to say go berserk)
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K (everyone tell me to go berserk)
Go berzerk, go berzerk
Go berzerk, go berzerk

[Verse 3: KB]
Let's get it
So authentic
One sixteen and the fam in the building, homie
You know we gotta kill it, keepin’ it cataclysmic, chaotic
Calm and cool, and you kiddin’? Come on, come on
I know you feel it when the beat drop
Girls like, “No you didn’t!” (that’s my song)
Handle my business, God my witness
Give it a minute I promise I'mma (wild out!)
When I get that feelin’, that feelin’ of pure adrenaline
Spirit’s fillin’ me up, ain’t no tellin’, homie, when it’ll end
I know the fire marshall gonna’ be comin’ around to shut this down
He entered the building and got his hands up to the ceiling now
B-Z-R-K
Goin’ off like Yeezy on stage
All the 808s, don’t need the heartbreaks
Juiced up on faith, don’t play
Everybody in the building go

[Bridge: Family Force 5]
B-Z-R-K, goin’ out of control (out of control)
We are that FF5, goin' digital gold (digital gold)

[Outro: Family Force 5]
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
B-Z-R-K, B-Z-B-Z-R-K
Go berserk
Go berserk
Go berserk, go berserk
Go berserk
