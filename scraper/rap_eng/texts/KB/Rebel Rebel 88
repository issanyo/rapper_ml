[Pre-Hook]
This ain't nothin' to me
You can write the rules, we never do 'em
You put up the walls and we'll go through 'em
Yeah, we'll refuse
No, we won't do it
No, we won't do it
Do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1]
Young rapper with a conscious
Native North got the compass
You not Jesus, boy, stop it
What you see, you can't calm it, get it
What you see (sea), you can't calm it
Over my dead body, you can have all of my money
Before you gon' get my obedience
I am American, Black is my heritage
But, before that, I'm a child of the kingdom
And that is my country, that is my country
We have a leader and none of your votes are persuadin' Him either
I give my taxes to Caesar, but not my allegiance
Who you more loyal to?
Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel boy
Level Bevel, sharper, never settled
Long as He is rose throw the pedals boy
My God, Democrat or Republican
Know that God isn't none of them
Oh, you lovin' your party?
Can you love folk, regardless?
We gon' love the people that you never had the time for
You forgot 'em, I'ma find 'em, I'ma guide 'em, 9-to-5 'em
God will crown them, God will crown them
Rebel the norm, embrace the scorn, rebel the porn
You been warned, we won't conform, that's it

[Pre-Hook]
This ain't nothin' to me
You can write the rules, we never do 'em
You put up the walls and we'll go through 'em
Yeah, we'll refuse
No, we won't do it
No, we won't do it
Do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2]
I might buy a condo in Miami now
Make it free for Refugee family now
Went to Bible College with no plan b boy
Semper Reformandi and we and we and we standing
My brothers still in the field Peyton Manning
Choice between two evils on my people, I'm rebelling
This is what I live for homie, this the hill I'm buried on
If Jesus is the truth, one of us is very wrong
Know that our God reigns, precipitates grace
Since the day that the fall came
Abel, to call Caine for the fame, he parts waves
Broke in the arcade, not a token for y'all games
Only one mantra, HGA to the coffin
Holiness this with no options
Are you finished or done?
I am merely a sinner
I'm just really forgiven
Respect our existence, respect our existence
Or expect our resistance, yeah

[Pre-Hook]
This ain't nothin' to me
You can write the rules, we never do 'em
You put up the walls and we'll go through 'em
Yeah, we'll refuse
No, we won't do it
No, we won't do it
Do it, do it, do it
