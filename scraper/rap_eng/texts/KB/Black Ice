JB: (You look so dumb right now)


(Chorus) KB: Black ice, ain't no blue ain't no white, black ice, I keep it heavy ain't no light. Black ice, ain't no blue ain't no light. Black ice you tryna jump me man you starting a fight

Verse 1: KB: Winter is comin, and you be slipping up but I'm homies with the ice so I'm filling up my cup. Haters saying man that looks like muddy ice, but actually you jelly because inside you think it's really nice. We rockin' with king ice, their name is in this title. Making me fly so I can get myself a bridal. Wearing Jordan 3's on the day of my wedding, and rasta marijuana leaf on my king bedding. Uh!

(Chorus) KB: Black ice, ain't no blue ain't no white, black ice, I keep it heavy ain't no light. Black ice, ain't no blue ain't no light. Black ice you tryna jump me man you starting a fight

NB: (yeah baby!)
