[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, everything, everything, everything gon' be all right this morning

[Verse 1]
K to the second letter
If it’s one for the money, two for the show
Three to get the honeys, you're forsaking your soul
But when my enemy's enemy is divinity endin' the enmity in between God and me, I’m good to go
This is real with your soul, cause we know life's hard
Pain's easy to remember, happiness don’t leave a scar
Tears fall from our eyes, paralyzed from his life
And conscious your conscience, sufferin's common
We ain't gotta act like we got it together, no never
But homie I know the one who can come get us
Look at us, look at us
Step but we're not pledgin' but we pledge to rep when it gets hectic
Even when it gets hectic we bless it, baby our blessin's are definite
Homie I can lose it all but that all's really false
Cause I ain’t lose nothing if I still got God
That’s why I tell my dogs, hope in what you can’t lose
Life is hard for us all but we found who to turn to
He turns our mourn into morning, we know that

[Hook]
Everything gon' be all right, everything gon' be all right this morning

[Verse 2]
Yeah, even when they write us off
“Church full of hypocrites”
Then you should feel right at home
Like you never been a hypocrite
Why you think we all here, we need Jesus to deal with this
See that morning after kills, like that morning after pill
We all fall, that’s why I’m into mourning after Him
He been making me new since the moment I began
There is pleasure in His presence, any moment I can dance
There’s trouble in the family, my homie's on his second strike
And Frankie's life fell apart the week that he accepted Christ
I tell my little dudes, "Succeedin' is up to you"
But it’s hard when they got twelve years of wack schools
Ooh, how do we deal with this mess
And abandon a damsel's distress
While the world turns to Novocain for numbness, I hope the same
But Jesus has promised us that this world has been overcame
Now we wait, it may not be today but...

[Hook]
Everything gon' be all right, everything gon' be all right this morning

[Verse 3]
Everything gon' be all right
Even though I struggle, it may very well be all life
But you ain’t gotta go to Africa to see dark nights
But it won’t be dark for long, one day it'll be all right
Rappers call us fake, they call us arrogant, and they call us narrow
But we just know we heal from the bottom of the barrel
I might be in the Caribbean, top down in a Camaro
But if I ain’t have jack my eyes still be on the sparrow

[Hook]
Everything gon be all right, everything gon be all right this morning
