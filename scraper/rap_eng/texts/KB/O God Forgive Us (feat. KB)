[Verse 1]
We've prayer the prayer with no reply
Words float off into the night
Couldn't cut our doubt with the sharpest knife
O, O God forgive us

Silence isn't comfortable
We want drive through peace and instant hope
Shallow faith, it has left us broke
O, O God forgive us

[Chorus]
O, O God forgive us
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us

[Verse 2]
Young and old, black and white
Rich and poor, there's no divide
Hear the mighty, hear the powerless
Singing O, O God forgive us

[Chorus]
O, O God forgive us
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us

[Verse 3: KB]
Forgive us
Yes, we have ignored You
So busy doing Your work that we forgot that this was for You
Arms wide to our homeless Savior
But arms crossed to our homeless neighbor
On bended knee, unite us all
Set us free

[Bridge]
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hand up and open wide, open wide
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide

[Chorus]
O, O God forgive us
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us
