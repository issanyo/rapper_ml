[Verse 1]
This is so anomaly
Cause all they want is hotlines, 1-800 callin’ me
But I’mma be paintin’ pictures with the Scriptures so that all can see
Politely got my attention when He came down and pardoned me
Instead of orderin’ me or Sodom and Gomorrah me
Orderly showed His heart to me, holdin’ me to His following
I come from the hood too, used to smoke that good too
Now I’m testimony homie, what the Lord could do
I fear for rappers who blaspheme when they spit
I called a spade a spade homie, you don’t know who you dealin’ with
Jesus ain’t playin’ games, the second comin' is still legit
The lamb that was slain'll be sleighin’ like Saint Nicholas

[Hook]
This is an anomaly
(Cats don't wanna rap about this, do they, huh?)
Look this is an anomaly
(This ain't too good for your career
But I'mma warn you like someone warned me, man)

[Verse 2]
God is still there regardless if you think He isn’t
Like jail doesn’t disappear cause you stop believin’ in prison
When it’s all said and done, when everything He said is done
All that mess that you said is done is over cause He said it’s done
Get the truth when I flow always, I’m on it, get up on it
And you know my crew gotta boast in the Lord only, and I flaunt it
Then I show this proof when I go back and forth with these dudes, but I know that the Lord
Is the one who can straighten out your boy, then make a move to the Lord of glory
They ain’t hearin’ me, they don’t sense this urgency
Think you got time, you’s a flat tire from eternity
Or a diagnosis, you know God is in your hindsight
YOLO, only live once, but you can die twice
Offendin’ you, trust me I’m a friend of you
Though my message is ignored more than the surgeon general’s
This is pinnacle, though you count it as miniscule
It ain’t cool to be criminal, the Judge’ll get to you

[Hook]
This is an anomaly
This is an anomaly
(Let me calm down a little bit, nah, forget that)

[Verse 3]
I’m likely not probably gonna be liked a lot
And everybody likes to be liked, they like he will more than likely stop
And I might be hot, but I fear a mighty God:
The boss, next to Him all other bosses are jokes, Michael Scott
Truth in the flow always, I’m on it, got focus, or I’m croakin'
But I know some cats think that I’m bogus, I’m open, come forward
You gotta prove that the Lord didn’t send Jesus to the world and bore
All my sins and He straight saved your boy from the same wrath that you will endure
For sure, I’ll face the music like Pandora
We’ll stand before the Judge, you need Jesus as your lawyer
I know this might annoy ya, I’m that voice you’ve been ignorin’
That tells you you in danger, something serious is comin’
They tell me not to judge but they mean don’t be offensive
If I judge you as cute, you call it wisdom
Look, every mouth will cease to run, we beseech you to believe the Son
Even PETA will need the blood of the Lamb when His kingdom comes
I ain’t worried about my legacy
I love you more than safety, I’m tryin’ to change your eternity
I was dead and I believe somebody brought this call to me
Loved me enough to tell me truth, this is so anomaly

[Hook]
Anomaly, anomaly
This is an anomaly, this is an anomaly
Anomaly, anomaly
This is an anomaly, this is an anomaly
