[Intro]
Aye, aye

[Pre-Chorus]
I was running with the set (yeah)
Running with the set (yeah)
We don't ever flex, we just rep
Hear me, no, what did you expect? (what did you expect?)
I don't need respect
I'm the threat (ah)

[Chorus]
Tell em I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie

[Verse 1]
Running through the, aye
Right back where I started with it (aye)
I've been on since college with it (aye)
They hit the club, I hit religion (aye)
Jesus, Jesus I'll admit it (aye)
I just give 'em livin' raps (aye)
You just give 'em Insta snaps (aye)
Do we need another post? (aye)
You insecure, you do the most
My side we revive God through the WiFi
T'Challa partner, never colonize 'round of high-fives for the top guys
Made us dangerous
Aim to bust, flame to dust, every idol bring to us, gangs of us
Trained to trust, the name that's blood stained on us, Christ gained us

[Pre-Chorus]
I was running with the shade yeah
I was running through with chains yeah
We don't flex, we invest hear me, yeah
This is what you get, yeah
I don't need respect
I'm the threat

[Chorus]
Tell em I'm so free I got no chains homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains
Look at my neck
No chains, no shame, rapper

[Verse 2]
Yeah come get your opinion, it don't matter
Money or the faith, I chose the latter
Ohh, I can see them trying to keep us on the outside now
We pull up and watch you scatter, yeah
Running through the woo (aye)
Heaven got a playlist
I promise that's my favorite placement (woo)
Faithful over famous
Yeah faithful over famous
New rappers that's sure to blow are really drug addicts with a studio
You gotta pop pills on the usual then that paradise ain't really coolio
If your world is really that flame then why you always high, tryna to escape?
Gram flexin' that's too fake and them money phones really money loans
And that real life is you coming home, empty house and a heart of stone
Bad chick super savage but for a bigger bag she movin' on
Oh yeah you making moves but these folks don't really love you
Industry only love dudes that they can use, don't get confused
Interviews that don't tip toe
Go on take down my info
His glory that's simple
Riding around with that tempo
That's liberal that's conservative, that's charismatic and reformed too
My wife happy and Jesus love me ain't nothing left to conform to
Haha(no chains on me, I got no chains on me)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was running with the set (yeah)
Running with the set (yeah)
We don't ever flex, we just rep
Hear me, no, what did you expect? (what did you expect?)
I don't need respect
I'm the threat (ah)

[Chorus]
Tell em I'm so free I got no chains on me
I'm so free I got no chains homie
Nappy hair, nappy hair, no shame, homie
I'm so free I got no chains on me
