500 for these shoes I'm a walking lick
Stomp him out with these Pradas if he talking shit
He say he on my head why he talking sick
He got a 30 on his hip but he ain't popping shit
500 on these shoes I'm a walking lick
Stomp him out with these Pradas if he talking shit
He say he on my head why he talking sick
He got a 30 on his hip but he ain't popping shit

[Verse 1: KB]
Why you lying nigga

Pulled up on your block had you shy nigga
Why you faking nigga

We on the block nigga, still hot nigga
Late night all about a pill nigga

[Verse 2: Mike Sherm]
A nigga try me he a dumbass

If a bitch broke, I'm like fuck that
We seen your main bitch choosing we gon' run that
You say you got a 30 never bust that
You the type to get shot at don't even bust back
These niggas always hating, where the love at?
I hit my cousin G-Bo Lean like where the sluts at?
You say you on my head, why you talking nigga?
No bite all I hear is that barking nigga
You hella soft like cotton you ain't rocking nigga
Over me my niggas broad day sparking nigga
