[Verse 1: KB]
Yeah, yeah, K to the second letter
How you want to do it homie?
I'm all up in it, down to the bone I feel it, uh
Coming and breaking it down with that wiggity wiggity style
Man we really be living it out on mission, uh
Flow God, no lie, oh yeah
We bust rhymes, one ride, no stops
Take 'em to show dog, see the most high, so high
Leave 'em so shocked frozen face like botox
Ain't no, ain't no, ain't no stars up in this tour
See, the stars that my dogs love to applaud
Are the faithful saints that endure
You could never stop 'em
You got a better chance winning the Tour de France
With no legs against Lance
Or seeing Mr. Edward Scissorhands
On Instagram taking a selfie
Your hell freeze before I'm ashamed off in my LP

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
All them really wanna come see
This beat 1-3-1-3
Get eight when I speak
I'ma say my piece
Throw the peace sign with some boatload of truth if you can't see
Yeah buddy, rollin' so deep it ain't funny
My beliefs on the back of that money
And I promise I ain't frontin'
I'm just tryna jump up on the track and let 'em know I run it
Yeah buddy, uptown be the place I put on for
Faith got me living risky like I'm going for it on 4th & 11
I ain't talking 'bout them Concords, do you want more?
Blake in the paint I'ma bang for the cause
Unashamed be the lifestyle more than them tours
Oh Lord, he coming back like an encore
If ya' don't know now ya' know boy

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't even know we was out here (Nah-ah)
They gonna find out what we 'bout here (Check)
'Cause everyday we turn up (All day!)
Yeah lights out 'cause the sun up (I know you see)

[Chorus]
And now they know, now they know
Say now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, yeah

[Verse 3: Derek Minor]
I'm done with hiding
We won't be denied no more (Denied no more)
Now they know
Always on my job
Y'all better check my resume
Numb to all the nonsense
Let's just call that novocaine
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so RMG
Light of the world when you look at me
Reflecting my King like he made me, never caged me like
Like Cujo, I'm off the le-le-leash
Give 'em fire in the booth it don't matter who you asking
Ra ra ra ra like a dungeon dragon
Doom doom doom, hear the bass beat blastin'
All up in your face, unashamed for the masses

[Verse 4: Tedashii]
Woo! I heard they needed to know
My whole crew spittin' truth
Yeah you needed it though
Hold up
Can't keep it closed, that's cruel
It be cold, like the heat was low
Hold up
Yeah this is it, your time baby get up and show 'em you with us
What burn at the core, like when you doin' sit ups
Unashamed, that's the message that we give 'em
I live it (Woo!) 'til the day that I'm finished
Copy what he did and I'm still authentic, winning (Woo!)
H-town my city, put it in the air let me know that you with it
Like mayne, hold up, unashamed with my gang I told ya (Uh)
My aim, no bane, no soap bruh (Uh)
In pain, my game, his hope 'cause

[Verse 5: Lecrae]
U-N-A-S-H-A-M-E-D we be goin' in
Recognize a real squad when you see mine
Don't it seem odd that we live our lives to please God
Press pause on a raw explicit (Now you tripping)
Unashamed of the truth but unafraid to live it
Still afraid of the leaven though I see my dough rise
One of those guys actin' like nobody know God like I do
Speak my piece, keep my peace
So I ain't gotta keep my piece, capisce?
Click thick like a chain, try to take a link up out it (Yeah)
We ain't unashamed just because we rap about it, nah
We unashamed â€˜cause we live it
I'm throwing out the real so they probably catching feelings
Give it away, give it away now, now nah that ain't it
I don't feel them 'til I hear them holla 116

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't even know we was out here (Na-ah)
They gonna find out what we 'bout here (Check)
'Cause everyday we turn up (All day!)
Yeah lights out 'cause the sun up (I know you see)

[Chorus]
And now they know, now they know
Say now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, now they know
Now they know, yeah
