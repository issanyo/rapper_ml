[Verse 1: KB]
Everyone knows the struggle
How many more songs to comfort
I don't know how to comment
I don't know where I'm going
All of these doors are closing
I don't know what you're doing
Will it go away

[Pre-Chorus: KB]
'Cause we don't have the answers
'Cause he didn't take the cancer
We can't pay the ransom
Are you far away

[Chorus: KB]
When sorrow's falling down like rain
When I can't hardly take the pain
All I know is
I will sing to you
(I will sing, yeah)

[Verse 2: KB]
How dare she still sing with the sting of prognosis
Scars will not close and the wound will not open
How can he still dream with a string of felonies
That's realer than Tel Aviv
A settled deep emotion
But a caged bird has a song and
Lynda, you had the heart of God and
Until your last breath
Never seen someone seem so alive on their deathbed
Saw you singin' of His promises, yeah
Saw you singin' in the darkness, yo
We'll sing until our problems end, yo
I'll sing over you, my friend

[Pre-Chorus: KB]
'Cause we don't have the answers
And we gon' fly forever
And we still have a heaven
I'll come back to You

[Chorus: KB & Casey J]
When sorrow's falling down like rain
When I can't hardly take the pain
I will lift up my voice and choose
I will sing to you
When I don't understand it all
When all my strength to fight is gone
I will lift up my voice and choose
I will sing to you

[Bridge: Casey J]
Glory, glory, be thou exalted
Lover of my soul
We owe it all to you
We owe it all to you

[Verse 3: KB]
He who has a tear, let him hear, that I'm here
Kneel when nobody else will, I'll steer
Let my voice carry you through the void
I carry you
To the force that buries the fruits of that fear
I will ask for you across the diaspora
Taking you back home like that foil
Can't foil the plan
You can't spoil the advance
The lamb royal
Hand toil
Every lily in his field
He that loyal
All night I couldn't sleep
Thinking about all the joy that I couldn't keep
All these holes in my heart, it just seeps
I've been pierced more times than I can speak
Got another hole from a friend last week
Lord, Lord, why so many holes in me
Then I saw the hands that were holding me
He said I know you
Son, I got holes too

[Chorus]
When sorrow's falling down like rain
When I can't hardly take the pain
I will lift up my voice and choose
I will sing to you
When I don't understand it all
When all my strength to fight is gone
I will lift up my voice and choose
I will sing to you

[Outro: Casey J]
All and all
We owe it all and all
All that is and is to come
We owe it all to you
We give you all and all
We owe it all and all
All that is and is to come
We owe it all to you
