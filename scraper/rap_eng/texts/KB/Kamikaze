[Verse 1: KB]
So, what I might fail and this might not work
You still gon' get this work
Been given this work, and it ain't based on my work
So applause ain't necessary
Trapped by all these critics
Errbody got a better way I shoulda did it
Boy, I didn't wanna go and witness
Scared by opinions, opinions
Wait, hold up!
Man, I am not the sum of what they say
Did they make me?
Liberate me? Save me?
KB's gotta be okay if they don't okay me
Might play for the A-team and be great
Or I might hit a wall like Beijing
May not mean much to ya'll
But I know it means the world to my God
So in

[Verse 2: KB]
Get it all
I am showing out, showing out
Been called boy, and I know it now
What is it that I got to fear?
Can you point em' out, my homie?
I'm going out (goin' out)
Even if it's pouring down (let it rain)
How could it be stopping me when this God is inside me
He controls the clouds
This time I'm a tip great things
No more safe kid
Take risk, aim big for the nameless, go kill everyday to the dead like May 5th
Cinco de Mayo
We going higher, my ego gone be on this bio
Minor or major, success is not a number it's faithful labor
