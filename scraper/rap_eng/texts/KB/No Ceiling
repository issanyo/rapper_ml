[Hook: Fedel & KB]
I don't see no ceilings[x4]
My God ain't got no ceilings
Grace for a sinner (Grace for a sinner)
My God ain't got no ceiling
Grace for a sinner (Grace for a sinner)

[Verse 1: KB]
Watch me
That dude with the tattoos
That rude attitude for the step, so
22 sittin' on 22 with 20 dudes packin' 22s all lookin' at you
Couple Street Fighters, boy it's some Ryus
Helping catch you, hidin' in the back room
Even sneeze wrong and them boys gettin' at you (bless you)
I'll take him in a catsuit
A medal
So what, she's the best?
Everywhere she go, boy, it's a burden
Her man buying Hermes
Boy, she only purchase Kermits
So they gotta have green let me sip this tea
Cause Iâ€™ll take [?] like a bow to the king
That ain't my business
(I can take on anybody. Anybody.)
You done went too far (went too far)
Change you, I make you anything he can make you
Anything he can say to you
Everyboy ain't the same
Colleges say that I'm talking famous
They offer 95 degrees but still miss the right angle
I had dinner with a murderer

[Verse 2: Fedel]
I feel like Paul, I'm the worst of all
Sinner boy or [?] boy
I was raised with them killers, boy
And I'm best friends with them triggers, boy
We gon see who realer, boy, when I pull up like, "What up?"
Oh I hope that we be talkin it
Lord please forgive me
I heard you've died for bad people
I fit [the Scripture? the description?]
Oh Lord I don't know nothing better
My work's still working, I ain't getting no better
I need your love, I don't need nothing better
I need your love, I can take their head
I bet he won't say [?]
Pray for me
Big sin, it's all sin in God's eyes
I have secrets, I tell God, "I'm tired of frontin', I'm tired of lyin'"
Sinner saved by grace, boy
God put in my place, boy
That's grace, boy, that's love, boy
A King all in my case boy
I'm on fleek and I know it
Screaming "I Will Be" I ain't going
I'm the new swag wearing strapbacks
I serve God and I show it
We all sin we all fell short
[?] took them nails for it
[?]
