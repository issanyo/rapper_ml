[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up, glow up, yeah
A lot of y'all still don't know us, so what?
Nothin' but Saints here, Nola, get no love
But hate talk, that's my bonus
For my quota, (What's that?)

[verse 1]
Boy, don’t nobody own us
HGA that's the law, here
Spurgeon with the Baldwin
Commas way after callin'
Patrick Ewing in the Garden
Groin' for my people starvin'
Keepin' up with no Joneses
Generous with my goal, yeah
Boy, don’t nobody own us

[Verse 1]
Squad needed merch so we bought our own shop
Free as my own hair, but I got it on lock
Count it all loss, count it all loss
Excuse me, I'm just tryna trust God
Finished off my last bit of debt, before the money
Got sent had to write it on the check
Don't nobody own us
This right here ain't a loaner
I move forward, too focus
All out of games, no tokens
No token, what's that?

[Chorus]
Boy, don’t nobody own us
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Boy, don’t nobody own us
Back to back with myself, yeah
In a lane with myself, yeah
In a lane with myself, yeah
Boy, don't nobody

No nonsense, (No nonsense?)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I taught KBj no nonsense, yeah
Don't you ever skip my process
Does it honor God and conscience?
You owe nothin' but your love man
Boy, do what you want man
Was trappin' out apartments
Now I'm takin' off on Tarmacs
Don't be driven by a contract
Have your lawyer check the CARFAX
Not amazed with contact
There ain't nothin' that my God lacks
I don't need none of your star stats
I was good way before rap
Wrote these so my God claps
I want fame where my God's at
Hip-Hop won't involve this
Radio hasn't bought this
Way, way too exhausted
To tap dance for your profits
I'm in love with my core fans
Hold it down before the door slams
Write free on my coffin
Christ rules on my content
Race, faith, and fashion
Free sons and the daughters
Free sons and the daughters
Boy, don't nobody
I'm in my bag, I'm back to back compassionate
With a pastorate, with a fashion sense
Don't try to tell me how to act in this
I'm black and rich and in the Nazareth
And passages attached to Him
Little activist with a dash of risk
But I'm back to biz, and impacts some kids
And the facts are lit, the immaculate fact that is
That the master is backin this
Cannot fathom this, born again
Only want manumit

[Pre-Chorus]
Woke up, show love
A lot of y'all still don't know us, so what?
He said death can't hold us
Nah, I'ma tell y'all my motive

[Chorus]
Boy, don’t nobody own us
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Bet the bag on myself, yeah
Boy, don’t nobody own us
In a lane with myself, yeah
In a lane with myself, yeah
In a lane with myself, yeah
Boy, don't nobody us
