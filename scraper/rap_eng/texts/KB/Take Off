[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Runway, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off

[Chorus: Ty Brasel]
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ

[Verse 1: Ty Brasel]
All things work for
My good I know
Big dreams, top flow
Eat good, combo
Just give me some time
All my life I been
Waitin' for my chance
Have patience, Young Ty, man
They want my soul and the glean (yuh)
They want me switch up the team
Lucy just want my allegiance
Run in cahoots with the evils
My God, I pray
Your blessings, my way (my way)
Light beams, Kanye
You lead, Sensei

[Verse 2: Canon]
Take off, get ready to go
Young Moses with the glow
I'm livin' color, check my skin tone
Dressed in all white like the pope
Young Joseph with the coat
Dream big 'til they hate you
We don't do it to get famous
Knock it off nah, bruh
I'm just tryna be faithful

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Runway, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off

[Chorus: Ty Brasel]
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ

[Verse 3: Canon]
I "skirt", whip in the coupe
Don't try to walk in my shoes
I'm Superman with them tight jeans
I teach life in the booth
She say she want the guala, guala
Check, this ring on my finger, no holla
I had to leave them genies in them bottles
Found a model now I'm full throttle
Woah!

[Verse 4: KB]
One way, downtown
Oh me, oh my
Sauce, sauce, Alfredo
Buckets, kango
Take off, they know
I land, Caicos
Start up then invest
Three stacks we, break out cast
Peak of the vibe
Daily I die, Cinco de Mayo
I come on down from the side
Intellectual thatâ€™s quick to get with you hype
Don't go to hypin' that boy, yeah
We will not lie to that boy, yeah
We do not wait for support, no
No vultures allowed in my courts

[Pre-Chorus: Derek Minor]
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off
Runway, take off, take off, take off, take off
Take off, take off, take off, take off, take off

[Chorus: Ty Brasel]
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ
Clear the runway
Take flight, MJ

[Verse 5: Derek Minor]
Minor in the pocket
Won't you come take off wit me
This United, if you blocking
We might move you out yo seat
You must be sippin' on sake
Boy, I ain't worried 'bout nobody
I know, I know that God got me
Float on this beat like a 'Rari
Wow, mane I see the devil on prowl
Yeah, he want to hold me down
He don't want me way up in the clouds
He don't want me way up in the clouds
I could never ever come down
A lot people online, tryin' to flex for a check
Always talking 'bout birds but it's never verified
None of my business, I just worry 'bout mine
The wave a tsunami, everybody run and hide, take off
