[Verse 1: KB]
My aggression, it’ll make me punch through a mountain for real
All this pressure and this pain make a killer wanna kill
I’m a product of the Killer Clan
That’s why my energy keep coming like a running
My adrenaline is pumping like a machine
It’s been a long time coming
That’s why I’m hyper like a viper when I strike or beat, I’m bringing heat
I’m spitting venom, and I’m aggressive like a king cobra
I’m KB The Kidnapper, playtime is over

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Let me start by saying fuck George W
I hope a grizzly bear sneak in your bedroom and smother you
Bush is the Devil, if you follow him, stop
Shadow of death over America, take all of ‘em out
And all you sellouts, although my right hand’s fast
His lips swole, not from the punch but kissing the white man’s ass
Scared of the police, but quick to murder your brother
Why don’t we buck up to these laws the way we do to each other?

[Verse 3: KB]
My aggression, it’ll make me bust through the penitentiary wall
And try to free Pharaoh, even though I know him
Outnumbered by the guards, I don’t care
‘Cause we tryna make another street military CD and that means
The guards, the warden, they’ll all have to lay it down
Killer Clan trespassing on federal grounds
With them automatic rounds without making a sound
The government is scared of us, them hoes don’t want no war here

[Verse 4: K-Rino]
Now when I finished him, the water in his bath was red
He hemorrhaged and bled and fell dead with half a head
I’ll make you dream you felt my wrath and got stabbed and begged
The right half of my head was bald, the left half was dreads
I’m a champion, I possess the pantheon
Of unreachable mind levels that you can’t be on
I’m the crypt keeper, the beef eater, breather of a street sweeper
Reaper changing beefers from shit talkers to deep sleepers

[Verse 5: KB]
My aggression, it’ll make me start beef in the streets
’til there’s nothing left on my plate to eat
Kick Bush in his motherfucking teeth
Walk in the White House and piss on the First Lady
Then take a shit and wipe my ass on the furniture
I don’t give a damn, I’ll go to war with the government
I’ll be the first nigga in history to kidnap a president
Put his ass in the pot, light the fire till it boil
Bitch stop lying, you took us to war for some oil

[Verse 6: K-Rino]
I know this bitch in Indiana, his name is Cash
Fuckin’ with the SPC, boy we’ll hide your ass
If you ever come to Houston, motherfucker you’ll know it
How you gon’ try to sell my verse and you ain’t paid me for it?
Making moves like you make it's how fools get shot
You named yourself after something that your hoe-ass ain’t even got
You’ll leave this place with a wrecked face
I’ll send your motherfucking spirit to Hell wearing a neck brace
