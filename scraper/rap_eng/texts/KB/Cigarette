[Pimp C]
I'm comin' down candy, I'm leanin' on the switch
I'm hangin' out the window, cup of barre, I see a bitch
Ho, money is no object but you think that it's a game
Steady try'na clock the diamonds in my piece and chain
Wanna rub on the grain, wanna sit on the butter
When bitch you will discover I'm a pimp and not a lover
See all the things I did as a kid off in the game
Made sure in '96 that I'd would be gripping' on the grain
I traded in the Fleetwood, in with the new
Got a '96 drop AMG, that bitch blue
Officer pulled me over but bitch you must be joking
That was a cigarette I was smoking

[Hook (2x)]
I ain't no joke [2x]
That was a cigarette I was smoking
Officer you must be joking
That was a cigarette I was smoking

[Bun B]
Too Hard to Swallow, Super Tight, plus Ridin' Dirty
Ever seen your weed as big papi
That leave your shit sloppy
I ain't hip hoppin, it's big player parlayer
The payer of the bill for the simp and the ?
So let's dip through the hills
Grip on the wheel, for the trip that's so real
We flip, can you feel, we pop the clip and the seal
Now how the fuck you figure you can handle what the trigger do
Stupid ass nigga you
I'm getting' bigger through constant elevation
Stay patient, one day I'll rule the nation
Live on your radio station, locin'
Officer, sir you must be jokin'
That was a cigarette I was smokin'

[KB]
ATL's the place
559 parking lot was the scene
Smoking big green with a bitch named Vicki
Ho dance down in Nikki's steady slipping
As this bitch give my dick hickies
Till one time pulled me over in my old school Oldsmobile
Officer, what's the deal?
I'm just ridin' round here on chill
With my dick on this ho's grill
Got the 98 smelling like straight kill
He said sir you know you're ridin' with one headlight
I've been rollin' for two months with them hoes on bright
He said your girl friend here is doing an awful lot of choking
It must have been that cigarette she was smokin'

[Hook: KB]

[Too Short]
Deep in the hood, I ain't driving too fast
Got my beat up loud and my ghetto pass
Why you pulling me over, what I do?
Got a funk full of dope, nationwide too
We in stores and we independent
That's why we always ride new benzes
I was smokin', yeah I did that
But it wasn't no weed, it was a cigarette
Now I gotta get out, I already know my part
People stopping' and staring, cause they know I'm a star
Ghetto legend, I know ya heard one about me
Got a stable of 'em, I never run outta freaks
Ridin' through the hood, high sidin' lookin' good
I blow a bitch mind every motherfucking time
With these pimp lines
Spittin' out the window
Car full of smoke but it wasn't no indo

[Hook: Too Short]

[8Ball]
Saturday night, we in the mix
A whole lotta bitches and a whole lotta tricks
I'm upstairs at the bar with hoes taking flicks
Try'na pick out the one that love to suck dick
I got two or three blunts rolled already
Two or three chicks ready to go already
I'm fired up, startin' to blow already
These hoes take one puff and blown already
We trippin' and we kicking' it
Drinkin' up, smokin' shit
DJs bumpin' hype shit, getting' a bitch open shit
All of a sudden police niggas walkin' up
Nose in the air sweating a nigga 'bout sparking up
Fuck what a nigga do, fuck what a nigga is
Fuck you and all the rest of these niggas in the rap biz
Before I knew it they was rushing me up out the club
All I could say is one thing and it was...

[Hook: 8Ball]
