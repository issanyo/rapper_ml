[Intro: Lecrae]
Whoa
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin' to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
On the reel
I'm a man
But I guess it's just my gender
When it comes to manhood
Man we leave it to our sisters
What a tragedy travesty passive in our actions
Living absentee
Stand and wait while asking them to marry me
We wait left into death saying next what a mess
Beating on my chest and thinking I am strong go flex
If you gone take charge for the Lord then you'll lead out
Being one who serves like the one who chose to bleed out
Submitting to authority government that's over me
And to the Father who is sovereign real men stay orderly
I learned to submit because God gives the command
While she follows me cause I follow him with holes in his hands

[Hook: Lecrae (Tedashii)]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority
(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority
To authority
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
(Bow down
Bow down)
To authority

[Verse 2: Derek Minor]
Hey I don't care what they tell you that cat's trying to sell you
You was made in the image of God his craftsmanship is in your cells dude
You are not a animal or just a foolish beast
You were made to oversee this Creation of the King now
Flashing your badge like a cop that's got some power
But you should be a tool to encourage and empower
And stop runnin' round with women like a little dog in heat
If she disrespect herself show her who she's supposed to be
She a queen and the scriptures say she is the weaker vessel
It's more like fine china
Doesn't mean she's any lesser
The equal wouldn't smash fine art to the ground
So why use your body or your words to tear her down, heyyy

[Hook: Lecrae]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
A real man bows down to authority

[Verse 3: KB]
You ask em what's a man?
They say that dude that got them stacks on stacks
In rubber bands finger to the government
I want it I get it it's mine
Can't tell me nothing bro
My money my girl and my nine
These my rules (What you talkin bout?)
Not one man should have all that power
He doesn't have it cause power is not ours
Feelin like you in control no you are owned
God is running it do as you're told
Ok let me talk to him real quick
Let me get to talkin bout submitting to authority
Somebody being over me we say no no
But we gotta get that if we are not submitting
Than we missing the fact that we are not our own
God can judge me and the judge says
If you do not follow then you can't lead
Get it
Live it
Got it
Good

[Hook: Lecrae]
If you can't follow you can't never lead
And you don't run a thing 'til you runnin to the King
And who I follow's who they follow when they follow me
