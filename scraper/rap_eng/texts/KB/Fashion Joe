[Intro]
GAWVI, get 'em

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Fashion, woah
High fashion, woo
Fashion, ahh
Where'd it go wrong? Where'd it go? I don't know
High fashion, ahh
But I like it, now I fight back, that's a right kick

[Verse 1: GAWVI]
I've been blessed (Swish)
Papa gave me the coat (Drip, drop)
But you look stressed (Yeah)
I got dreams, I got dreams, yeah
Enemies, enemies, yeah
Family probably gonna hate on me (Hate)
Hit the dash (Dash)
Look it, they all come back (Come back)
Hey, call me Joseph, yeah, Fashion Joe, hey
Blood on my robe, yeah, God saved my soul, yeah
Ahh, pray for me like ahh
Take the breaks off, ahh, yeah, ahh
Yeah, hey, ayy

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Fashion, woah
High fashion, woo
Fashion, ahh
Where'd it go wrong? Where'd it go? I don't know
High fashion, ahh
But I like it, now I fight back, that's a right kick

[Verse 2: KB]
Bentley coupe, Jimmy Choos, I might get me two
Fendi, Fendi moves, tennis shoes, silly, silly you
I'm a Don when that Henny brews
I be killing dudes, woo, see me
Red dot, Hindi, Hindi you
Plenty, plenty choose, OG, OG, I got minerals
Intervals saw the gold mine, Emmy, Emmy dude
Timmy, Timmy too turned up, designer make us cool, man
How 'bout the designer that made you, then?
Woah, I got the newest drop, ayy
La ropa de Dios, si, si, me gusta
Get lost in the hues that are in my coat
Been a boss from the view from the Almight'
Done feelin' alright wearin' Off-White
'Cause it cost Christ, covered all life
Ain't no better fall line

[Chorus: GAWVI]
Fashion, woah
High fashion, woo
Fashion, ahh
Where'd it go wrong? Where'd it go? I don't know
High fashion, ahh
But I like it, now I fight back, that's a right kick
