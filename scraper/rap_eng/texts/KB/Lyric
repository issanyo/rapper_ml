[Verse 1: KB]
It must of been 3AM when the text came in
The sum of my fears
My stomach bendin', my thumb was tremblin'
No pun intended, but I wanted to die
When I saw it was him
Then it read, "KB, this time it's real, homie I can't live"
It was in all caps
But I knew he had no caps on his gun or his pills
So I ripped out the door
All the covers down on the floor
No shoes, I just walk on my tears
Callin' him over and over and over again
While I'm throwing the car in to gear
How could he be so selfish?
Will this happen, felt it
Why won't he answer, answer, answer, he answered!
"Jason, hello?"

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Who would of thought I'd step inside this train station
Then get hit with some inspiration
It's amazing
The most beautiful pieces of art come from the ugliest situations
So I praise Him, rejoicing in my suffering
Cause I know He's got a masterpiece in the making
And I ain't scared of death nor Satan
Cause I know whose hand that my name is engraved in
This right here is a proper statement
I am not the artist, I'm the canvas that He's painting
Like I remember last year being homeless
Sleepin' on the air mattress, but on the phone with
Three record labels, who to go with
I know that you like to fix things with them tools that are broken
So when them dark nights hit his soul
I know enough to know to trust you with what I don't

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Ooh, I promise you, you better come tell 'em, tell 'em
I ain't the one, I never was, I never will be
Somebody better come get 'em
I wonder what got in they head
Wonder what got in they mind (mind)
They got me mixed up, messed up
Click, hold on it's somebody on the line
Hello, uh, I ain't tryin' to build CHH
I'm in my own lane but they like he ain't safe
They rappin' in a bubble can't nobody see they face
I ain't worried 'bout a genre, the street ain't safe
I know some people out there probably envy my space
But envy is empty, come see my face
Full of scars, full of pain
I don't see much grace
Street Fighter, Ryu, catchin' heat all day, I'm good
And lately I've been hangin' in the hood
Everybody lookin' like, what?
You for the people, you pushin' back evil
Not just in the steeple, you out in the woods
Where the lions and the wolves at
Still waters run deep, but my crew run deeper
We already died we ain't scared of the reaper
We are too alive we don't fear what you're speaking
Seeing sideways, eyesight crooked
You ain't never seen us cause you ain't lookin'
And if I say Jesus, everybody start bookin'
Get out the kitchen when I'm cookin'
Pot sideways, whippin' that, whippin' that bass
That's what they wanna hear us say
Until we all get caught selling twenty dollar rocks
And we're just another slave of the state
Seeing sideways!

[Outro: KB]
I See You I Hear You
Hope is calling you
