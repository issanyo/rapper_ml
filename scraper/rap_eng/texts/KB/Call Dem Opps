[Intro]
Oi', Smilez
How come these bloggers talkin' like they know suttin' B?
What do they know?
Talk ain't good fam, I'm tryna show man, man
Wouldn't call dem man "opps"
Never that
Ya get me?

[Verse 1]
If he's strapped, when we see him then we blaze it on him
If my bredrin move shook, then I'll take his from him
I ain't got sense fam, I don't care who's watching
Man know I've got the juice like Johnnie Cochran
When Daze step on volts, or drop hints
And that Fizzy in his hand weren't no soft drink
Ask about KB and how I burnt man
Then I seen his bredrin in jail, and he firmsed man
You ain't got real beef, less it's back and forth
Had em' runnin' from the bull like a matador
You can't play upfront if you haven't scored
Scored so much goals, where's my Ballon D'or?
Listen, I ain't got beef with no pop star
He only talks rough, 'cause he got scars
When I seen them on the field?
I never seen them
Now they're on the net, tellin' people that we beef them

[Chorus]
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)
What's the word when we step through their block?
A mussi' dem' man, we just heard shots
Keep the engine runnin' fam, just kotch
Now drop the gearbox, dat there just dropped
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)

[Interlude]
Yeah man, mix up, mix up fam
You know what it is blud?
It's not even real blud
That's the whole point of the tune man
They're not opps blud
Evens with me, they're not "opps" fam
'Cause man been talkin' on the net
They're not "opps", they're not gonna do nothing blud
Do you get what I'm saying?
To the fans and that, they might think "yeah, yeah"
But, we know he's not gonna do nothing blud

[Verse 2]
You better think about your life choice
Til' I'm back runnin' shit like a Viceroy
Realist nigga that I know, is a white boy
He'll leave you on the floor, hearin' white noise
Everybody's saying KB's switchy
But don't check up on the blogs, check your history
If was you, don't approach me, it's risky
I'll shoot you in the back, 'cah I'm slippery
Done it on Gooch, and Moseley Road
Palmed it on the Drive, and Laxford Close
Carried steel through Cannon Hill
I beg you tell me, who done the most?
They ain't opps fam, we just ain't into them
And now they're talkin' wicked on the internet
I bet he's just embarassed 'cause we chased him
But we had a live wap
I would've done the same ting

[Chorus/Outro]
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)
What's the word when we step through their block?
A mussi' dem' man, we just heard shots
Keep the engine runnin' fam, just kotch
Now drop the gearbox, dat there just dropped
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
Nah G, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)
What's the word when we step through their block?
A mussi' dem' man, we just heard shots
Keep the engine runnin' fam, just kotch
Now drop the gearbox, dat there just dropped
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
I swear fam, I wouldn't call dem' opps
(Nah)
