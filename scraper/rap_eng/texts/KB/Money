[Verse 1]
Got ma song as a ringtone
Gettin' rich and gettin' mind blown
Better back off from ma zone
No childzplay cuz we all grown, and
Holla at me if u want some
Got dem goodies and u don't
Sittin' on ma throne, while u sittin' on ya stone
Better believe that i'm not overthrown
Haters only motivate me
Optimistic and a little sketchy
We can get down like i was hades
Me and my team, got over eighty, and we
Feeling kinda hazy
Say we kinda crazy
We in the benz and we poppin' them bottles
And all i can say is that yeah you amaze me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah you amaze me)
I go far for you (i go far for you)
I do it all for you (do it all for you)
I go slow for you (i go slow for you)
I do it fucking all for you

[Chorus]
But now im all for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money

But now im all for the money, for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me, fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read, wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money

[Post-Chorus]
But you played me (played me)
And now im solo (solo)
Im keepin you high
But you keepin me low (low)

[Verse 2]
So i was at the park, just written some lyrics
Started thinking bout' a plan, maybe going to Paris
I'm never underprepared, cuz i always got the money
I'm not gonna brag, not doing it for the dummies
Lookin' down from the balcony, seeing some faces
And now know where im at and im ready to face it
Whenever the dream seems to be gone imma catch it
No lie, im up high, so so like im
Standing on the edge now, ready to fall
Hearing some voices, sayin' it's not my call
Hearing adrenaline pumpin', yeah im standing alone
The stage is all mine, this is where i belong like

[Pre-Chorus]
(Yeah you amaze me)
I go far for you (i go far for you)
I do it all for you (do it all for you)
I go slow for you (i go slow for you)
I do it fucking all for you

[Chorus]
But now im all for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money

But now im all for the money, for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me, fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read, wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money

[Bridge]
Yeah you amaze me
I go far for you

Yeah you amaze me
I go far for you
I go slow for you

[Chorus]
But now im all for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money

But now im all for the money, for the money
I ain't playing, dont fuck with me, fuck with me
I got your text, don't wanna read, wanna read
So now im all for the money, for the money
