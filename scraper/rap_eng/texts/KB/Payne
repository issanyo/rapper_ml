[Prod. KB]

[Verse 1]
I ain't been working hard
I might just miss the bus
I ain't working enough
I ain't worthy of praise
I tend to worry a lot
I been worrying much
I been stuck in a rut
I been noticed my image is ignorance on a shrine
Introverted and keeping a distance hurting inside
[?]  all the emotion [?] you should be hiding
Kinda like there's a reason she posed to be in my life
But

[Hook]
I know I been pretty distant
Head in the dirt
I been straying from the pigeons
Pray for ya nigga airs is thinnin' by the minute
I might fade away
I might fade away

[Verse 2]
And lately I ain't eating strategic
Thinking maybe all this praise is ain't the shit that I'm needing
The pipes flooded the sinking here
For recent memory I couldn't think why it's thinkin' here
My entire perspective switch when I started being here
My mama call me to check on my presence
I don't answer the phone cause I hate to answer her questions
I’ve been feeling alone since the day i was out there
Sentence’s made, in that Nicholas Cage
I dropped a tape and didn’t notice the ceilings was raised
Peep a [?] they throw a bunch of shit at my plate
And since then my tendencies gray
And we been working like we expecting a fucking tentative pay

[Hook]
And I been pretty distant
Head in the clouds
I been straying from the pigeons
Pray for ya nigga airs is thinnin' by the minute
I might fade away
I might fade away

[Outro]
