[Intro: KB]
Lion King, yeah
Suzy, KB homie
Lion and the lamb
Yeah

[Verse 1: KB]
Uh, gentle Jesus, meek and mild
That's how they see Him now
Jesus of your convenience
Never heated, thumbs up when He smiles
Your so mistaken like He can't incinerate a whole city
Wrath more dreadful than all Jamaica
And any attitude, anything less than gratitude
Is rebellion, idolatry of proportionate magnitude
How can you figure you're gonna get with the dude you're attracted to
While the God of the universe is specifically mad at you?
I'm talkin' holiness holier than the holiest
Angels who are beholding Him, cover eyes or they won't exist
Knees are folded when they get close to His awesomeness
His presence'll send 'em repentance or their lives will be over with
Behold the Lamb, Christ Jesus, the substitute for the heathen
Only One that can stand the wrath of God and keep on breathin'
Righteous, resurrected ruler, redeemin' these rebel bein's
This lion's also a lamb for mercy for those who believe it

[Hook: Suzy Rock]
We all know-oh-oh, this world is a jungle
We only got one hope, oh Zion
Our God is a king, He's a lion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Our God is a king, He's a lion

[Verse 2: Suzy Rock]
I know this world is a jungle, baby this life is a forest
And we surrounded by beasts, they seek to kill and destroy us
They say we better take cover, and run for it like Forest
And while they prey on the weak, we just gon' keep prayin' for 'em
And fear can't be afforded, the God of Jacob's my fortress
And yeah I'm walkin' in pride, baby the Lion is roarin'
Persecution and sufferin', they raidin' our villages
They wanna push our wig back like the Indians
We got a King who hears the prayers of the indigent
Ending the fears and the affairs of the invalid
Thunderous power after the interment, and death was the instrument
So we can see His glory in a clearer lens
Its no drummer here but we're aware of the snares
Snakes on our heel but He was crushin' his head
Took the stripes of a tiger, He went out on a limb
I got a lion king so this jungles just a gym

[Hook]
We all know-oh-oh, this world is a jungle
We only got one hope, oh Zion
Our God is a king, He's a lion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh Zion
Our God is a king, He's a lion
