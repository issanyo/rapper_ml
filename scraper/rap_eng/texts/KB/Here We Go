[Hook: PK]
Here we go, we're fighting just see another day
To behold the beauty and the glory of His face
Here we go, we're fighting just see another day-ay-ay
And we know, that we gon' bring the trophy home to stay
Here we go, oh, here we go, oh
Here we go, to behold, oh
Here we go, oh, here we go

[Verse 1: KB]
Everyday I got one goal, to convince myself that there's one Lord
It's not me or the things that I long for or the world that awaits on the other side of the door
I would walk away, my faith would fail, I would fall today
My hearts so prone to go astray, every morning I pray, it's a call for grace
I don't miss this, I beg the Lord to give me vision
Lord, I wanna see beauty in the scriptures and not gibberish and just miss it
But God I wanna be hit with your glory, I wanna feel it
Lest our temptation will lift and we will win when we see Him
He's greater than pornography, taste Him you'll find like a harvest week
All will see for my God, who can find a match?, no eHarmony
He controls the economy, elects presidents from nominees
Every evil in the world can descend against me, not a hair will touch unless He decrees

[Hook]

[Verse 2: KB]
Cats are always asking us, I know you say "but He'll take all that"
Break your back for the Savior mayne, man He better be real off the way y'all act
KB, man you went to Brazil, don't trip man you know how fine them chicks is
Tell me you ain't wanna take a little, huh, you better wake and live
If they knew our God and what He does to a human heart
My God would light ways through the dark
No, He won't let us, we'll wait, yes He'll come get us
Jesus He's our treasure, yeah she look good but my God look better
And I know this, when I'm at my lowest
I ask the Lord to give me focus, I know joy comes in the morning
His weight and glory is how I fight depressions
They say God is our crutch, nah, He's much more like my stretcher
