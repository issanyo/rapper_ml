Lyrics from Snippet:
[Verse]
Y'all gon’ sing to us, but God did it
Then my God came through us and bought us, yeah
Let 'em mock
Look at the rocks
That they pickin' up and toss
Still pickin’ up the call
And then I go deliver with my dogs, homie
Itching for the ball
Comin' on, givin' it all, gettin' the call
Puttin' on for the Lord and the laws
Cause the word of God is not in Harlescott
That's the part we love the most
And if we lost we sauced on up

[Chorus]
My God
It's on its way
It's on its way, boy
Give me attention
