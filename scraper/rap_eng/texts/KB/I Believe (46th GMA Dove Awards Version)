[Intro: Mattie Montgomery]
I
I believe

[Verse 1: KB]
They tell my young dudes that success is up to you
But that's hard when you got twelve years of wack schools
So it's rap or it's packs, either way they get them bars
When they give up we get charged
What's the system to our God?
We don't fight for the W
But we fight from a W
Never said it wouldn't be trouble
But, but he bring trouble to whatever troubles you
A struggles do multiple valuable things that are wonderful
We suffer through, hustle through all the things he wants to humble you
Humble you, take you and break you and make you to another dude
Any other truth, he's the one that can comfort you, aight!
Makin' all things new
Tell the paralytic he gon' dance
Breast cancer, she won't win
Racism, he gon' end
What He doesn't heal now, He gon' then
Let's go!

[Hook: Mattie Montgomery & KB]
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win
I (I)
I believe (I believe)
I believe that (I believe that)
I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win

[Verse 2: KB]
Let's get it
I'm goin' with our voice
Where they got them bullets flyin' like it's PowerPoint
And then I'm going down to HiCo
With a chance of makin' it down to flocko
I'm with the kids on the Southside each day, reach age
And then head for the Keys like spring break
Breaking like I need a sold out concert
Kids can't hear pain
Let me talk about it
I get it poppin', pop it, you probably got a problem
'Fore they can stop me, gotta cut my power like I'm Amish
Hold the torch up high in the thick dark
Dream works no matter how bad the pics are
Cause I see how bad the globe is
But they don't know how bad our hope is
They don't know how bad we want this
It ain't where we at boy it's where we're goin'!

[Hook: Mattie Montgomery & (KB)]
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win
I (I)
I believe (I believe)
I believe that (I believe that)
I believe that we will win
I believe that we will win (turn up), I believe that we will win (turn up)
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win (turn it, turn it)
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win
[Mattie Montgomery and KB]
I believe that we will win, I believe that we will win

[Outro: KB]
We're better together
