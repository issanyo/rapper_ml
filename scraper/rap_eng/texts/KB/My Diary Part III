[Intro: KB]
My name is KB and this is My Diary, Part Three
There's so much I want to share with you
But I guess I can't put it all on a song
Truth is, I ain’t got too many friends in this Business
I guess that's the nature, right?
But it’s all good

[Verse 1: KB]
I took some time off and youngsters thought I was done
I don't know what charts y'all are checking, but we still number one
I heard you blowing hard
I'm from the era where CRI$I$ was a big dawg with a big dog
They wanna know  how I lost the award
Well congratulations to the winner, He won
I give him applause
I ain't losing no sleep, I hold it down to the floor
It's a shame that talent doesn't matter anymore
I guess that's the thanks I get
New producers throwing shade at every chance they get
I'm just watching from my throne 'cause I'm gone
A wife and some kids at home
Any day it's been suits over troops
If your fans feeling me, just excuse the massues
Name a career that I ain't started
In the booth, on the radio supporting the artists
(True) I'ma keep this flag in the sky
They wave 'cause we fly
We passing you by
You couldn't fit in my pants if you tried
I stand by the team, K-AMY till I die
.
[Chorus: Neo]
My diary, my diary, my diary
My diary, my diary, my diary
Pages of my pain
Pages of my gain
Diary
Pages of my pain
Pages of my gain
Diary

[Verse 2: Chef 187]
Young Chefy, we all over
Sounds so soulful
Listen
Daily ndachitapo let down umo
Pa impiya paka achite frown umo
(Alo ninfika pa Zoona) ni mu town umo
One day nka mufulilapo crown umo
Ala lishina Ili lisa nama pressure (sana)
Life is a … don't know how to face her
Abanandi, ba bululu, nama neighbours, all look to me for ama favours
Insokoshi nfyele fye ukutinta
Plus nalilaya nechupo Mutinta
Lubuli uyu so nfwile fye ukuchimfya
Akapimfya amatumba, kafwele dye ukufinfya
Bread winner ne chalo pakubeya
Lesa akabwesha amapalo pakubeya
Mwishikulu wabana ka pula fyalo
Sorry ba mbuya nami mwene fye ku burial
So napano mwambona ndi guilty
Nolo yali itaika kale milki

[Coda: KB]
I remember meeting Chefy back in 2010 when Alpha introduced me to him
I had a chance to sign him but then I thought he was trynna sound like his brother then
Well, that's one thing I regret till today
Well such is life
I have learnt one thing though: Never Underestimate Nobody 'Cause You Never Know What They Will Be Tommorow

[Verse 3: Alpha Romeo]
Mwenze mu 2010 journey pene ina yamba
Killa enze kuganiza ati ndine che wa viamba
So nenze navambili vo proova
Bantu mu Zambia fulu voba uza
Mu Game nenze kushota so siyenze complete
Nenze funikila kuti tizi chaya compete
First single President inaba tila mpepo
Bana dabwa nina imba vamene  sibana imbempo
Ninshi tabagenela a bit by bit
Killa ango pangapo che beat after beat
Yenze ni hit after hit
No chaya secure seat
Kwezelibe na debate olo ochaya defeat
Muphando ninautenga Slap ana Ulula
Ndiye pebana ziba ati nkhani ya lula
Apa abwela ruler kuba kolopa mulla
Basiya naku uhuwa uhuwa, taba shatapula
Nilibe time yo tomola bene tinathandiza
Bama yenda ma years, ba bwela no tipeza
Still tikaliko tichosa che vikali
Mu Game tikali tima sansamo vi curry
Wonder why sibama tichatako nominate
Sibakali nokuba bebachamaya Overate
But Ili che, Hood ndiye motivation
Bwela pa K-Amy ndiye pakali –Occupation!

[Chorus: Neo]
My diary, my diary, my diary
My diary, my diary, my diary
Pages of my pain
Pages of my gain
Diary
Pages of my pain
Pages of my gain
Diary
