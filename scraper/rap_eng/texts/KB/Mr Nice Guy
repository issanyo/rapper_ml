[Verse 1]
For years I've been striving
To make an art outta hiding
Smile real big
Like I'm doing alright
Pristine on the outside
But inside I'm dying
Trying too hard
To prove I'm fine
Can't stay
This way
No more

[Chorus]
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Welcome to the new me
Taking off my disguise
Chasing something risky
No more Mr. Nice Guy

[Verse 2]
I'm a grown-up now
Got a house and a family
"Better safe than sorry" ringing in my ears
Right about now I need to break out
To be what you made me
Free from lies, free from fear

[Chorus]
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Welcome to the new me
Taking off my disguise
Chasing something risky

[Bridge]
I never knew it could just be me
Now I'm never going back
To what I used to be
What a relief it is to be free
Now I'm never going back
To what I used to be
Nice guy

[Verse 3: KB]
Pretty smooth Jimmy
Nothing more risky than living risk free
Staying in the lines never gave us Sistines
Rather lose life than waste it
Keep the combination
No more playing it safe, kid
Second rate you or a first rate me
Rate me, rank me, praise hate me but KB
I'm living for what He would say
Only gonna be one me today
The one that's freed with grace
What did Needham say?

[Chorus]
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Welcome to the new me
Taking off my disguise
Chasing something risky

[Bridge]
I never knew it could just be me
Now I'm never going back
To what I used to be
What a relief it is to be free
Now I'm never going back
To what I used to be
Nice guy

No more Mr. Nice Guy
