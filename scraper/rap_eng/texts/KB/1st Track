Intro: yeah im here. this the moment you strive for. this the moment you live for welcome to the 1st track


Course:
Tryna ride through the gate
Push away all the hate

Verse
Yeah i pulled up in the game
Got my watch on heat so you know its a flame
This people be burnin
This workers be earnin
These haters be chirpin
And shit i still be turnin
Up into the past bitch
You should of asked bitch
Yall can hear me at last bitch
When im rollin the past bitch
Be rollin a joint
Wait a minute lets get to the point
Catch me up in the water
Pull up like a shark and  im gonna slaughter
And miss i just fucked your daughter
So i know im goin on need money sell like a pawn
Treat it like italy bitch i am the don
See ya later poof im gone


Course:
Tryna ride through the gate
Push away all the hate
Bitch this is your fate
Be pushin deflect and negate
Home boys tryna narrate
But you gotta remember the state
I put this all on my plate
And you will never escape
