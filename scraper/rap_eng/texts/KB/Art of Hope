[Intro: KB]
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over now
It's over

[Verse 1: KB]
Oh what I would do if I could change time back
Change my acts instead of change my facts
What if once a month I would of gave y'all back
Instead of finding new ways I can give y'all tax
If we celebrated faith like we celebrate gold
Sold out souls over sold out shows
Somewhere in the field I think I lost my goals
Who is that man in the mirror really I don't know
What if I told the truth about my doubts?
I been mad at God since my dad stepped out
I am not the man of God I'm paid to be
God saves sinners, oh, did He save me?
Strayed so far I'm a mess though (I'm a mess though)
I'm far-out messed up (I'm far-out messed up)
Oh God, I'm a wreck though (God, I'm a wreck though, yeah)
But can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
If you ain't never left us
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
(If you ain't never left us)
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
Can we pick up where we left off? (yeah)
Can we pick up where we left off?
If you ain't never left us
Then maybe it's not over
If you ain't never left us

[Verse 2: *unknown artist* & KB, Both]
Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought, by day by night;
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light
