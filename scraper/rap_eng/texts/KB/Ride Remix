[Intro: Lecrae]
I don't, heheh, I don't know if ya'll-yo, I was sittin' back there watchin' the HGA dudes 'fore they-'fore they-'fore they was up here...bless the name of the Lord, man

[Verse 1]
Uh, let me get that
Y'all boys gone sit back
If the mic is open I'mma grip that
Here's a clip from the clique
Then it's click clack then blast like (pow)
Might have been some foes (pow)
But it still ain't cold
But it's hotter than Peter Piper
Pickin' a pack of peppers
And puttin' it on your palette
I'm bookin' it, everbody better get it
Them boys ride for that
Trust me, don't nobody get in line for that
Lay your life down on the line for that
Gospel (ain't nobody got time for that)
But these boys got a survival kit
These boys bringin' the Bible in
Cause if they can breathe then they can lead
Show them to the Fathers door

[Bridge]
HGA off in this thing
In this thing, in this thing
HGA off in this thing
1-1-6 off in this thing
(I mean, what I'm seein' is young cats, 18 years old, who are sayin', "I'm ready to die and live like...like I wanna live my life centered around Christ!")

[Hook]
You know they gon' start somethin'
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Boys comin'
You hear them boys coming
Turn up, turn up
Turn up, turn up
Once you hear them boys comin'
You know they gon' start something'
(Them boys ride)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm so turnt up in this thing
Ready to work up in this thing
Sittin' dust to the worst to the worst
And we work to the birth of a church up in that thing
Better believe the Lord sees us
Haha, yeah, Spirit of God livin' all in us
I go off like my shift's done
I'm on that win that war for Jesus
More glory for my King
I ain't tryna be no preacher, I can't deny what I've seen
I've seen grace straight, shake, break
Tell 'em [?] make fake, place the hate
Man, I go ape, praise, praise the great God
Who can take a sinner and make him a saint
Amazin' grace

[Skit]
That young and sayin', "Yo, I got my whole life ahead of me and God can have it all"
And look at life through those lenses and see your life is here for the glory of Jesus Christ alone

[Bridge 2]
HGA off in this thing
In this thing, in this thing
1-1-6 off in this thing
In this thing, in this thing
HGA off in this thing
1-1-6 off in this thing

[Hook]

[Outro]
Them boys
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Them boys ride
