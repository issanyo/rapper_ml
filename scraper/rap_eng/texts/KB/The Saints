[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Ok
I don't know but I've been told, when the saints come marching in
We roll so deep that they can't believe we sold out seats and them CD's
Please don't sleep on the beat, I beat up these
Still don't get it, would you keep up please?
We ain't no heroes for sale, if you bought one better keep your receipt
Ok, I get it, I know what they thinkin'
We some kumbaya singing corny Christians, keep yo' distance
Buy a ticket to a concert, pay a visit think it's odd?
We them blues brothers, 116 on a mission from God
I don't think they get it I really think what they gotta do is see it to believe it
I wasn't plannin' on leaving them
Gimmie the microphone with no gimmicks I'm really livin' it so yeah
I may not condone it but I donâ€™t condemn it
You ever wanna get it well tell 'em to come and get it
I point 'em to a God and we tell 'em we really with Him
They thinkin' that I'm trippin cause I'm livin' for more than just rappin', but that's what happens when...

[Hook]
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in
Oh when the saints go marchin' in
Oh when the saints go (marchin' in), saints go (marchin' in)
Saints go (marchin' in), saints go (marchin' in)

[Verse 2: KB]
Oh no, here they go, go
Them boys sold out, no promo
Tell me give em' two years, it'll go cold
But them words got ate like ocho
I'mma keep it 300
Huh
Industry probably wanna see us gone
But we in it, we in it, we live it, we get it, our God gonna do what he want
We fragrant, The aroma is that our God saves
Married to the Rock and I'm faithful
To take these words, Beyonce
Don't it feel like we famous?
When the world don't know what our name is
But heaven knows us baby, and that book of life is that A list
Bravo
I'm so rich and I ain't talkin bout' cheddar
But I bank on Christ go and talk to the teller
Cut the checks that I get I'll be cashin' forever
Swing
Laugh at the saints that ain't a thing go
They be lackin' to pay that thinkin' straight
Man, we ain't lacking a thing wrapped in the faith
Paid by the blood of the Lamb
Debt is paid, debt is paid
(Where should we go)

[Hook]
Oh, when the saints go marchin' in

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
Now I don't know what you've been told about us bout' us
But we gon' love em even though they doubt us doubt us
We just visiting like we some out of towners
Got em' asking us how does this God turn ya'll into shouters (hol' up)
We don't really think we better, call us perfect no never
But we glad to be call saints cause Paul called us that in the letters
Set apart for the Savior, He's led our heart to the Maker
Forget the art that we making if we never love our neighbors
You might catch us whistling, marked to the spot straight glistening
Shining cause we filled with Him, you might wanna listen in(ha ha)
Messiah came down the He reigned and He rose
Here yeah they go with this again
That's what makes us love our neighbors
We knockin' so let us in

[Hook]
