[Intro]
Let's try it out baby boy

[Verse]
Uh, K to the..., straight spitta from the slum, J-Dilla
Faith in us, better come get us
Great spitta when we comin' to yo block, straight hittas
Little bit of nay say in the Bay, K straight
Never hate, never break nor kill him
Pull up in the middle of the industry and pull a Reggie Miller
Indie and I need ya to pace with us
Yeah, I wrote this at the mall
Spit it at the Mac store, they said I gave ‘em genius bars
Livin' to know Him and dyin' to make Him known
Like I paid Sallie Mae for ‘em, Jesus can't leave alone
Six years today, my queen is not a rental
Chicks looking green, I flash the ring like Ryan Reynolds
Never mind, I'm defined by divine, I’m a branch on the vine, just try this riddle
Rather be givin' one woman a hundred, than trying my love on a hundred of women
We got the God-head, we got the father, we got the pardon, uh
We got the pardon, we like to party without Bacardi
We go the hardest without the harness
[?] artist, anybody wanna get a little bit of peace I got ‘em
Melody is sweet I promise, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, Tempo Tour
Me and KB J comin' to your city
Can we say bye baby boy?
Thank you for this
We out, so gone
