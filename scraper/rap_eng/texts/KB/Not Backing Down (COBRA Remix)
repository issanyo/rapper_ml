[Verse 1: Blanca]
I walked the line
I stay out the way, yeah
Never speak my mind
Livin' in a shade of grey
But the more I got to know me
The more you start to show me
This isn't how it's meant to be
So I'll just keep on walking
And you can keep on talking
I'ma have to make a scene, yeah

[Chorus: Blanca]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
No I'm not backing
No I'm not backing down

[Verse 2: Blanca]
I've watch the game
I've stood on the side line
That same old same
But now it's my time, yeah
Cause if you don't stand for nothin'
You always fall for somethin'
This isn't how it's meant to be
So I'll just keep on walking
Let him do the talking
I'ma have to make a scene, yeah

[Chorus: Blanca]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
No I'm not backing
No I'm not backing down

[Verse 3: KB]
Coming soon...

[Chorus: Blanca]
I played it safe, been afraid my whole life
Now things have changed
Won't stay silent this time
No I'm not backing down
No you can't count me out
Nothin' in this world gonna stop me now
No I'm not backing down
No I'm not backing down, down, down
No I'm not backing
No I'm not backing down
