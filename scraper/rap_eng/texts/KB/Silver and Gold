Silver and gold
Silver and gold

[Verse 1 : KB ]
Aye, Last year man I made more money than I ever made in my life
Granted, it wasn't really that much cause we never had much
Just enough was enough for the guys
Jump in the truck, take a ride (take a ride)
And I went a bought a crib with my bride
It was a crib without a baby in it
Me and KB-J in the back y'all when I get back
Then we back to the back car, when I’m back to the start
Hold Up, I remember
That empty fridge apartment with no power in it (slip back)
Still we got, we will turn power steering
Your money’s too cheap to fund my joy
We had that work you can’t employ
I roll in
We had that work you can’t employ
We roll in
We had that work
Boy we got treasure, we’ll be rich forever
Look they can have it all
Let that money fall
But when it’s all said and done
We’ll still be countin' (we’ll still be countin')
We’ll still be countin' (still be countin')
We Rolling in it
Roll in, Roll in
All my Dawgs they go in
We Rolling in it
Roll in, Roll in
All my Dawgs they go in
We rolling in it
But still we can't

[Verse 2: KB]
Aye, I know a girl in that wall street, climbing to the top
She said Christ came and broke her
You know he a beast with the stocks (huh)
When you still making knots
And you’re not gonna flaunt
How they not gonna not
But she don’t care about what they’re about, she coulda got a yacht
But she stay giving her money to the mission on the block
Now That’s amazing!
Gave His life so we gave up powers
Daylight savings
Silver and Gold
It’s good so we tried to make it
Since our treasure’s in heaven
We cheerfully gave it
No Envy, That’s Vegas
Content G, with out Savior
We got everything in our Savior
And the New Earth is waiting
Better get what I’m on
You are not what you bring home
Be rich in good works
Cuz that’s what you bring home
