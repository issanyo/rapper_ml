Yeah all I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
Yeah all I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is

[Verse 1: KB]
(UH K to the second)
I be feeling like Jackie Robinson
Rocking the 42 in my dodger fit
Gripping the arm that was just took by a pitch
Crowd the opposite saying that I should quit but I done threw all of it
You can hate but you can't hurt me
You can hate but you can't hurt me
And my worth is safe I can leave this earth today
Gassed up on grace how they gon' circle K
I don't want no new Bugatti
Put me in Nimba County
Liberia I'm serious
Mosquito net and my Bible
Concrete bed I'm still smiling
Ain't eating much but I'm smiling
I'd rather be in the jungle and in the will of God
Then anywhere else outside it
Boy, I'm Bout It
I'm in this life
But my hope ain't in this life
A good career book for years, I book them peers
A good look just won't suffice
But homie my life is hidden in Christ
My life is hidden in Christ
Gimme 99 problems plus one Godhead
The result is

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Yeah all I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left

All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is

[Verse 2: KB]
OK, our God's never failing
Ain't nothing you can tell Him
Yes He's the generous type
But you face Him you will take that L in
No our God won't fail us
We know from where our help comes
So I put my life at stake
Though it might be blood I want that well done (100)
If we flipping burgers if we flipping houses
Man our bank accounts don't mean nothing
And if we paid a lot or if we paid a bit
We gon' be going in cause He's coming
We tryna be the best that we can be
And rest so that the world can see that He's done it
No matter who cuts the checks or where we working at
Man we work for Him and we love it

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Yeah all I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
100 till nothin' left
All I really know is
Yeah, all I really know is 100 nothin' less
All I really know is 100 till nothin' left
All I really know is
All I really know is 100, 100
All I really know is 100 nothin' less
All I really know is
All I really know is 100

[Outro: KB]
I just wanna hear that
Well done my faithful servant
A life full of pushback
At that moment will all be worth it
Cause my work is worship
And when He comes back for His church all over the earth
We'll be given no less than what He gave us first
