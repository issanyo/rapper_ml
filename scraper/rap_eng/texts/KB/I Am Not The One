[Verse 1]
Black boy, all white class
Call me the white boy with a black mask
White vocab on the south side
Boy, you better have a nice jab
You don't know, you don't know
My whole life I've been a type cast
And they never let me win free
So I'ma teach in that life class
I should be, I should be tired by now
I don't wanna cry no more
I should be cold from the marks that they throw, but
I will not, I will not ever go back and then forth with ya
Call me every name under the sun, but
You won't get a rise
I am not the one

[Chorus: KB]
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I am not the one
Oh I, oh I, oh I
I am not the
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 2: KB]
What they gonna say?
Too far, always gonna say you took it too far
That's cool but know nothin' finna move dawg
Cause we live for the opinion of the true God
Exactly who you not
It ain't thick skin, it's a new heart
Heaping burnin' coals on a woosah
Who can turn your enemies to a futon?
Too squad, lookin' like a military hoorah!
You can't regenerated soul on Luke Cage
I will kick it in the pain homie, Liu Kang
You might need a president but homie, who reigns?
Satan got a pin on me
So what you gon' pin on me?
A pen on me
Free, free, you can't put the pen on me
They depend on me
Win only when they already paid your penalties
Who is K to the second?
I am cool when they messy
They can't take my peace
'Cause they did not give it to me
The spirit of God is inside of me
You are not fightin' me

[Hook]
I am not the one
I am not the one
No, no
I am not the one
You don't know what I've done
The man that I've become
I am not the one

[Verse 3]
Cross 'em, they blackmail you dawg
Well, I am a black male and Christian
That's three strikes against me
And plus you ain't blackmailin' God
Counted out since I learned how to count
Count of cowards, no account, will not quiet down
I am gettin' louder now
For the great I am
The show ain't sold out but I am
And if it sells out homie, I can't
You callin' me and just know you gon' get you some Jesus
Cause tonin' down, I am not
Politickin' for no status
Kingdom got me feelin' massive
All we know is please the Master
I am not goin' backwards
Callin' me the Christian rapper
All I know, I just wanna be more Christian than rapper
I am not the one you should know
I am not the one you should know
I am invincible when I'm invisible
He is the one that you look for

[Hook: KB]
I am not the one
I am not the one
No, no
I am not the one
You don't know what I've done
The man that Ive become
I am not the one

[Outro: KB]
He is, He is, He is
He is, He is, He is
