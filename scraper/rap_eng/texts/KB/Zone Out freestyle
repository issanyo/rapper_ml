[Verse 1: Poncho]
It's funny how things; how thing things work out, for His glory, and for His praise. We thank God for freedom, we thank God for peace, we thank God for justice, we thank God for liberty, we thank God for what we can say, we thank God for what we can do, we give Him glory, and we give Him praise, 24/7 and we simply blazin'

[Chorus: Chris Lee Cobbins]
‘Cause I’ve got tunnel vision, yeah I’m focused on the light (He’s with me)
Can’t see a thing ‘cause I’m focused on the Christ (come with me)
You can try to kill me but you can’t hurt me
You can bring whoever you want, want
You’ll never break me, won’t penetrate
Once I get off in my zone, zone yeah
I’m in my zone, I-I-I-I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
I’m zonin’ out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out
(I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out, (I’m zonin’) out

[Verse 2: Poncho]
We give God the glory, we give God the praise; for everything that He does in our life. Jesus Christ He died for us; 24/7 so that we can live. We can have peace and we can have justice; in the name of Jesus everybody say amen. Hallelujah give Him glory and give Him praise for everything that He does for us. If it wasn't for Jesus we wouldn't even be here, if it wasn't for Jesus we wouldn't even be livin', if it wasn't for Jesus we wouldn't even have life, but thanks to God we get a second chance in life

[ Chorus: Chris Lee Cobbins]
‘Cause I’ve got tunnel vision, yeah I’m focused on the light (He’s with me)
Can’t see a thing ‘cause I’m focused on the Christ (come with me)
You can try to kill me but you can’t hurt me
You can bring whoever you want, want
You’ll never break me, won’t penetrate
Once I get off in my zone, zone yeah
I’m in my zone, I-I-I-I’m in my zone
I’m in my zone
