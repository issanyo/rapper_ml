[Intro: DAB]
I'm just tryna get through
Just tryna get through

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
People tryna keep me quiet
Scared I'll start a riot all up in the streets
They don't see me representing
They don't get it
They don't understand the reach
Slippin' in the darkness
Lord, I'm feelin' heartless
Can you help me find some peace?
Can't explain what's happenin'
But I'm livin' backwards in the dark where I can see
I'm poppin' pills to go to sleep
Poppin' pills to get it poppin'
Got a Percocet to keep the peace
Got a purple pill to feed the problems
And I'm fallin', I just might be here a while
So picture me wylin', I can't lose what's in your wallet
I got this picture perfect picture of a new indentured servant
I'm a slave to you, call me a surgeon but won't call a surgeon
Well, this is an emergency
I'm wretched soul, got a heart of stone, need another one
Tryna murder me, now I'm all alone
Hear the serpent telling me it's edible
Pray for me

[Hook: DAB]
War weighin' on my heart but I can't fall
Seekin' shelter from the storm in a bank roll
Tell me how you keep us warm when it's so cold
So sudden in the way
I'm just tryna get through
Just tryna get through

[Verse 2: KB]
In '05 we was young and wylin'
With the ladies runnin' never got flowers
Told Chris if you love her, tuck her
'Cause she'll be at the crib watchin' Rush Hour
My daddy used Bill O'Riley
Show cut him like Bill O'Riley
And it's cool rappin' 'bout the The Rock
Till you seein' your daughter lying blue on an IV
No lyin', that's bad reverend
Southside, I'm back reppin'
Gave us one leg to stand on
And get mad when they see us half-steppin'
Automatic weapon, automatic reven
Drivin' through the streets
You better call a medic
Man my dawgs are itchen
Better call a vet
And why the God of heaven put us in this hell and
New rappers, that's usual
Drug addict with a studio
It's ODD and we OD'ing
Like OD, we catch a bullet for more morphine
And that's empty (Montana, Montana)
Consume more what doesn't fill Im listening
Who got the plan?
Who got the plan to fix this?

[Bridge: Andreas Moss & KB]
In the valley of death, pray for me
In the valley of shadows, belay, belay for me
(Maybe the pain is a sort of message)
In the valley of death, pray for me
(You know that feeling you always try to escape)
In the valley of shadows
(Listen real close)
Belay for me
(It might be God saying)

[Hook: DAB]
Just tryna get through, through
Just tryna get through, through
Just tryna get through, through
War weighin' on my heart but I can't fall
Seekin' shelter from the storm on this blank road
Tell me how you keep this warm when it's so cold
So sudden in the way
I'm just tryna get through

[Outro: KB]
I know you just wanna get out of the pain, you know what I'm saying
But there's a lot of things this pain you gotta us
You see the voice whispers on the mountain tops but screams in the valleys
Listen, because when the voice gets through
When the voice gets through
It can change the situation
But it also changes you
