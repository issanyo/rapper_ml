[Verse 1: Mack Brock]
Out of the silence, from the void
Creation resounded in Your voice
Horizons awaken high above
Collisions of color, the world You love

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mack Brock]
How beautiful the stars
Imagined in Your heart
Silent in the darkness
How could it ever be
That You would choose to be

[Chorus: Mack Brock]
One like us
There's no one like Jesus
How wonderful is Your love
God with us
In glory, in power
I'll praise You forevermore

[Verse 2: Mack Brock]
Majesty humbled, Love came down (Love came down)
Unequaled surrender replaced a crown
Who died on a hill where grace was born
Humanity rescued, no longer torn (no longer torn)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mack Brock]
How powerful the cross
An altar in the dust
Triumphed in the darkness (darkness)
For it could only be
That glory chose to be

[Chorus: Mack Brock]
One like us
There's no one like Jesus
How wonderful is Your love
God with us
In glory, in power
I'll praise You forevermore

[Bridge: Mack Brock]
Your love is strong, and there's nothing stronger
Your name is great, and there's no one greater
Your praise goes on, forever and evermore!
Your love is strong, and there's nothing stronger
Your name is great, and there's no one greater
Your praise goes on, forever and evermore!

[Pre-Chorus 3: Mack Brock]
How precious is the name
That broke the heavy grave
The first to rise in glory (glory)
And You will always be
The King who died for me

[Chorus: Mack Brock]
One like us
There's no one like Jesus
How wonderful is Your love
God with us
In glory, in power
I'll praise You forevermore

[Verse 3: KB]
I know no other name
I need no other ways
I need no other grace
My God will find a way
I can go all of day
To the glorious God of Heaven
Needed a universe for His hall of fame
Give Him your life not a holiday
Pedestrian raps
I give 'em the righter way
I got the righter way
I could just ride away
Into the glory of inner and outer space
Into the story of how You can moderate
Sinners and sinners and sinners and God
You just walk into the dark
You just walk into the heart
Make it a home and a heart
Painting Your love on the walls
You finish whatever You start

[Interlude]
I just spend my days right here
I can put my faith right here
Livin' in Your presence
Wash away my shame right here

[Verse 4: KB]
The Son became one of us
And I became one of his sons
This is what I want for my sons
Don't matter whatever that comes
It's not what you did, it's what He's done
Lay hold to the One, He's holding you too
Three times as hard, because He foreknew
High-five the truth, six times we fall, but seven we're new
