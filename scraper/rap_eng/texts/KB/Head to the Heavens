[Hook (x2)]
You can knock me down
He gon' pick me up
Who can keep me down
When He gon' get me up?
I got my head to the heavens
Got my head to the heavens
I got my head to the heavens
Got my head to the heavens

[Verse 1]
Ay, I done lost my mind and I know it's true
You see me but I don't see You
My eyes are where the Savior's at, the leadin' role in how I act
But it ain't no act, Jack Black, I live for His Son
The star of my movie, I'm truly owin' my will, son
There'll be no sufferin', hated for makin' much of Him
Chasin' us through the jungles hear "Allahu Akbar" with guns and clips
Leukemia in our daughters, cancer came through and took our lives
While the world says that's a crooked God, we know He will be glorified
You wit' me calculatin' my steps, I count on You
In the womb You knit me with intensive care, call it ICU
So when we suffer let me take it and show the how much we value Him
Though the body they may kill, the truth of God abideth still

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2]
(Yo my marriage)
I done lost my mind and I know it's true, who marries at twenty-two?
Don't you wanna live your life? The last thing you need is a wife
One woman all ya days, sounds like a ball and chain
Well, if my wife's a ball and chain then boy I love bein' a slave
You don't know my aim but I'm on display, showin' the world how He loves His church
And it ain't easy, look at the cross homie, you think love doesn't hurt?
They treat they women like Mickey D's, select a chick and make 'em strip
We lookin' for a help meat I guess Michelle's my prime rib
Yeah, that's where I be on light to my home where I belong
Wanna give my sons and daughters more than child support and chromosomes
Girl, I made my vows a I.O.U. regardless if I'm lovin' it
Divorce is not an option, I will die keepin' this covenant

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
They say livin' for Christ is to limit your life
But when did we start takin' wicked's advice?
Livin' for nights, fights, women are nice
When the riches of life are in it in Christ
If your vision is right
You don't have to fear 'bout the end of your life
It's the end of your night, you enter the light
You go to be with the One Who is bendin' your sight
I used to be that boy, lovin' my sin is a trap boy
Trap boy, I would put I before everything, like a Mac store
I will be mastered by that boy, puffed up, bad boy
Flesh get whatever it ask for
Unless I keep my eyes on that Lord, Jesus

[Hook (x2)]

[Outro]
Eternal perspective baby
As we head to the heavens
We keep our head to the heavens
Focus on Jesus, Colossians 3:2
Was it Colossians 3:2 or 3:3?
Let me see...
