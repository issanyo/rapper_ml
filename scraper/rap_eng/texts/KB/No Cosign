[Hook: Flame & KB]
We do not need a cosign
We do not need a cosign
We on a different type of time
We on a different type of time
We do not need a cosign
We do not need a cosign
We on a different type of time
I don't need no cosign
We do not need a cosign
We do not need a cosign
We on a different type of time
We on a different type of time
People say we got a closed mind
People say we got a closed mind
We ain't hang around like clothes lines
We do not need a cosign

[Verse 1: Flame]
They don't see the clock we tick to
And they don't see the signs like a lot of icthus
We take long shots like we got a missle
And try to hit a few with these gospel issues
That's why the whole team on go
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't do it
Validate, allocates y'alls influence
And make us all obey what y'all say is cool
If God say no then He right
If God say go then green light
Don't look to the streams and to get likes
Doing things that will contradict Christ
Ain't tryin' be ride your way
Smoke this, drink this, pop this pill (uh)
Can't be out here tryna play
Trying to finesse me, no y'all just chill
Trick me out the truth
Fitting in the group
So that you approve
May it never be yeah it's on sight
Only one right
Got this clear sight
No apologies
And even if I'm solo (yolo)
And everybody proves to be a no show (no show)
I'ma do what he tell me do (speak up)
And I'ma say what he tell me to say

[Verse 2: KB]
This is a cold case
This is a closed case
Already made my bed
Full strength Colgate and the lights are out
I know what lies about
I know what rides about
Milk been spilled what you cryin' about?
Mamma told me go and buy the cow
Easy to me my boy I've been going off for three nights
Yeezy to me my boy I'ma be great by these stripes
Check it with the team like boy was left with nothing
That's less to trust in but left to trust Him
Invest in something
And let's get up then, the blessed be jumped in
Easy to me my boy
The blessed jumped in
Check it with the team like boy
I don't need no cosign
