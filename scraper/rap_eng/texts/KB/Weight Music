[Verse 1: KB]
It feel like fire in me, finna light a fire indeed
Light up entire cities with the glory, I got em trippin'
I'm standing awe with me, all other awes are empty
Better make haste to the great taste to the great faith
Man don't know what y'all been missin' (ha)
When you can feel it, this is more than music
The weightiness of the Savior can bury it and consume it
Yeah that weight got a weight to it, awaken you to God
That weight got a weight to it, come and see a Man who died
And came alive, Jesus the Son of God
I'm on the dot, He should be on the top of our little I's
I'm talkin' lookin', I look to the book, the book of life
And you can see glory, if it's boring you got crooked sight
Here for your joy, I'm on some other world
Earth can't satisfy you homie, you gon' need another world
Sin is a killer, vanity will leave you smothered girl
Death'll cause medics to come wrap you in a cover girl
(Yeah, Weight and Glory)

[Hook: Jenny Norlin]
Glory, all I see is you
Holy one, I love you

[Verse 2: KB]
There's this never ending thirst, it exists in all of us
Try to quench it with getting stuff but stuff has never been enough
It's only in Adonai, trust in the Son's sacrifice
You ain't gotta stay thirsty, Dos Equis will comply
If you gotta sip of this frequent living water
The world's most interesting man is Jesus, He's the author
They find it comical I make music to prove 'em wrong
Life isn't breathin', life is knowing God
From Him I get omission, that mission is my vision
To see the Son of splendor, if I don't then sin will eclipse it
My mission's to the Scripture, I feast on Christ and get so fat off of God I spoil sin's appetite
You were made for the secret Savior
The glory of your Maker, ya show Him off in behavior
This is what it means to be human, to be consumed with the weight and glory of Yeshua
And lead people to Him (and I'm goin')

[Hook]
