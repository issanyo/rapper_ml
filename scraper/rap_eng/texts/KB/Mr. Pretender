[Intro]
(Coughing)
What you mean you done with me?
Yeah, you for real? You finished?
Crazy, we'll see about that, we'll see

[Verse 1]
I be killin' it, I'm ill and legit
Whoever say I'm illegit don't say that when they hear my blessin'
Christians say I'm nemesis, go look at Genesis
But who cares? I'm friend with benefits innocent
I can, I can get you right
Me and my homie, endorphins are air tight
Pleasure's what I swear by
My one code is there's no code
Do what thou will, just for the thrill
Give it a go, don't let nobody hold you
So what you need with a God?
You made it this far, who is He to call the shots?
But did He really say I'm no good for you?
Then why I'm so good to you?
Forbiddin' me He shouldn't do

[Hook]
It's a shame that I can't say
That I know you when I've known you forever
When I've known you forever
Mr. Pretender, Mr. Pretender
Thought I knew you but I didn't
And even though we're finished
Can't believe you had me living in your fantasy
Mr. Pretender

[Verse 2]
I was tryna satisfy ya, deify ya
You do what you think is right, you be the God you bow to
I can take you higher
And those Christians are liars
River in Egypt, they in denial
But when you felt better
I know afterwards, guilty, dirty, and real pressure
But there was real pleasure
I'm here when it gets rough
I got website that'll get you fixed up
A blunt that'll make you lift up
Of course I told him he should go divorce her
He's a man, how he gon' be faithful to one girl?
And he knows it'll cost him his life in ministry
But I make him think it's worth one night gettin' in the sheets
I'm a beast, you can be a Christian and live in me
God can have the public but in private it will be him and me
We need liquor, need strippers, homie ride or die
Go put that bullet in that magazine and make it fly

[Hook]
It's a shame that I can't say
That I know you when I've known you forever
When I've known you forever
Mr. Pretender, Mr. Pretender
Thought I knew you but I didn't
And even though we're finished
Can't believe you had me living in your fantasy
Mr. Pretender

[Verse 3]
So what I might've lied a lil'?
And my good friend, Death, kills
But don't act like you didn't know
You love the way I make you feel, you know the deal
Look, I got wages, a paycheck
For instance, you thought you was havin' safe sex
I promote latex, get your wrapper dog
But a condom can't protect you from the wrath of God
I had the world deceived, then came Jesus
Thought I beat Him, but on the cross I was defeated
Imagine that, He deceived the deceiver
Left me on the ground bleedin'
While he leads slaves to freedom

[Hook]
It's a shame that I can't say
That I know you when I've known you forever
(**Cough cough**)
When I've known you forever
(Hold on, I'm dying)
Mr. Pretender, Mr. Pretender
(But I ain't dead yet!)
Thought I knew but I didn't
(Forget Jesus, join me in hell)
And even though we're finished
Can't believe you had me living in your fantasy
Mr. Pretender, Mr. Pretender
Thought I knew you, but I didn't
And even though we're finished
Can't believe you had me living in your fantasy
(I am the deceitfulness of sin)
