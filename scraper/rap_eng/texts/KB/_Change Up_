(Verse)
These niggas lie and they snitch, I cannot fuck with
Shit be apart of that shit
These niggas act like a bitch, claiming they real , but switch
On the niggas they with
Promise to God I won't change , fuck all the money this loyalty
Still stay the same
I swear to God I won't change its deeper then ever I'll never
Get lost in the fame 
R.I.P daddy and R.I.P momma, all of these pain got me going thru trauma
Delt with the bullshit I delt with the drama 
But I cannot do it no more
Came from the struggle I came from the bottom 
Been had them issues I been had them problems 
Tell me go get em , I'll tell you I got em 
These niggas don't know the story

I came from not having improvise (Improvise)
I see the jealousy in you 
They talking down on me they envy
I'm with them in heart but I keep my distance
