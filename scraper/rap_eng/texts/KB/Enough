Psalm 73 verse 25 and 26
"Whom have I in heaven but You? And earth has nothing I desire besides You. My flesh, my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion."
Even if my heart may fail
Doctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell
I wanna show that You're enough
If You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here
Imma show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough

Does God have a wonderful plan for my life?
Plans to expand and land me at heights
Possibly sovereignly and landin' a wife
And His hand in my life is an answer to my life
I don't know and I really shouldn't care
Cause what is any of that to His love and kindness?
Particularly giving me breath and my body
On top of you saving a sinner outer inner all that you given me
Jesus wasn't fly, Jesus wasn't cool
Isaiah 53:2 says that Jesus wasn't cute
He was poor sorrowful, Isaiah 53:2
He's the master you're the servant
What you think is in store for you?
Is He enough?

I'm all good, I'm so content
And I don't even gotta large house with a fence
Maybach, Benz, with A/C intense
Or courtin' a girl that submits till the end
(Nah) Cause this ain't a trend
And all that stuff could remain absent
So I'm persistent to stay consistent
To show the whole world that God's sufficient

Even if my heart may fail
Doctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell
I wanna show that You're enough
If You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here
Imma show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough

I don't wanna just talk, I got to show
Cause I gotta couple brothers in the hospital
And I gotta couple brothers from across the globe
Poor or sick, with joy you got to know
Feelin' bad, you tell em I wanna pray for you
But they feel worse sayin' they wanna pray for you
Oh you thinkin' we got it worse, it's a mistake for you
Livin' in America is what's great to you
No hatin' you, prosperity's replaced the truth
When God is only enough, if enough when He's gracin' you
Y'all don't value faith, you only value what your faith can do
Y'all love to eat but hate on the Person who made the food
So I'll pray for you but let's make a truce
When famine hits you won't ignore the light like an ambulance
Hold on to the Savior even in the midst of your affliction
Remember our condition your afflictions ya chance to witness

Even if my heart may fail
Doctors say all ain't swell, pockets ain't swell
I wanna show that You're enough
If You ain't there, You can keep heaven I don't care as long as You're here
Imma show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
Show that You're enough
I wanna show that You're enough
