[Intro: Flame]
I’m putting it all on the table man
2-P-1:3
I’m all in
2-P-1:3
The whole team all in too
2-P-1:3
Game on! KB! Let’s go

[Hook:Flame]
RIP to the old me (to the old me)
Raisin’ the stakes my chips in (my chips in)
We 50 deep and ain't bluffing (bluffing)
My poker face, got on my poker face

[Verse 1- Flame]
Man I’m so far gone like Pluto
Like a running back through that 2 hole
I’m putting it all on that line boy
9th inning grand slam, Pujols
All or nothing, no straight
Got the highest hand, no straight
Got a 10, got a jack, queen, king, and ace
That’s a royal flush, if you ain't know
What that mean? Man what that mean?
Rally around me like “Ven aqui”
All that mean is King Jesus
Gave His everything on that tree
Gave us everything when He died
Gave us the winning hand when He rose
2 Peter 1:3, all things, LORD knows
All or nothing see I ain't bluffing and I ain't flexing
I’m turning up
They pulverized Him, they brutalized Him, they crucified Him
They strung Him up
He resurrected, I rose with Him
That Great Commission, I go get ‘em
I’m so fishing, I’m so Christian
I still believe God can sober up
Any- body’s- sin- problem
Holy- Spirit - Gospel - got ‘em
We just- gotta- be all- in
It worked back then with Paul & them
I’m a stick to the script, I’m all in

[Hook:Flame]
RIP to the old me (to the old me)
Raisin’ the stakes my chips in (my chips in)
We 50 deep and ain't bluffing (bluffing)
My poker face, got on my poker face

[Bridge:Flame]
We all in (we all in)
A-a-a-all in (we all in)
Tell me we all in (we all in)
A-a-a-all in (we all in)
A-all in (we all in)
A-a-a-all in (we all in)
Tell ‘em we all in (we all in)
If they asking, if they askin
Then we all in

[Verse 2: KB]
Can you feel that?
Every breath, every pump in my chest
Is a blessin
I’m blessed to give back, back to back to Him now
Sits high, real rap
No lie, the impact
Oh- my- God
Cuz I saw God back in ’05
Want me to stay calm
You kiddin man the ???
Imm’a be up in it for a - minute
When the Spirit livin in me I’m a start and I’m a- finish
And you gotta deal with it- us
Making sure that you feel it whenever we step in the building
F-fearing nobody
Cuz He ain't beat by nobody
Checked the tomb and found no(body)
Get it? They found no body
That’s why I go so Canelo, Ward, and Cotto
I’m fighting for my country, that’s the kingdom
And you know though
Hold up, hold up, hold up
We can bet our lives that we win
Cuz He said He’d get out that grave
And look at where He’s seated
