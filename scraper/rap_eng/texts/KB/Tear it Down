[Verse 1]
Let me get that there
Living it holy I gotta get that first
Picking up the microphone and giving you that lyrical miracle biblical rhetoric in that verse
And I ain't letting up
Coming strong ain't playing bruh
Super serious about the glory of the Lord we livin it so we ready to give it to ya like (woah)
What you think we in bible college for
Studying for hours for
Spending up all kinda dough
Ain't just tryna be no scholars no
Wanna know my God and hit these streets
Break it down it's strength and weak
If I get labour in with laymans
What good is theology
So your university
(pro)ffessors making athiests
Everybody nodding heads
My dirties burley taking it
'ffessor call me out
Talking bout
How you deny the truth (truth?)
Shoot now I gotta Ravi Zacharias you (Lemme ask you a question)
They say it's wrong
To say someone's wrong
But that statement got contradictions all on its own
Their arguments we tear 'em down
This ain't judgement
I am not a judge I communicate what the Judge meant


[Chorus]
We gon' tear it down
Tear it down eh, we gon' break it down
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out yeah
We can do this now
Any thought that exalts itself
Against the God of knowledge yeah
Demolish it, I gotta tear it down
We gon' tear it down
Tear it down eh, we gon' break it down
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out yeah
We can do this now
Any thought that exalts itself
Against the God of knowledge yeah
Demolish it, I gotta tear it down


[Verse 2]
It feel like daily you got haters coming up to you
Tryna debunk you and pump you with scientific proof
See I've been backed into corners tryna figure out what to do
I know who I believe in homie
I ain't scared of none of you
See they ain't take religion from out of the public schools
No they just took Christ and replaced Him with Darwin and some other dudes
Now we all exist cause lightning one day struck a pool?
Naw B God was the cause
B, like the Huckstables
Air tight
Air tight
We don't fight with flesh and blood but with the Words of Christ
They say our weapons foolish
But it ain't no shame in me tearing down lies with the Truth
Even if it brings pain to me
Patiently we meek with it
Humbleâ€™s how we keeping it
That hope we got is strong
And they won't dig up nothing to weaken it
To this we give our lives
Live and strive
Th-th-the glory of God is on the line


[Chorus]
We gon' tear it down
Tear it down eh, we gon' break it down
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out yeah
We can do this now
Any thought that exalts itself
Against the God of knowledge yeah
Demolish it I gotta tear it down
We gon' tear it down
Tear it down eh, we gon' break it down
Bring 'em out, bring 'em out yeah
We can do this now
Any thought that exalts itself
Against the God of knowledge, yeah
Demolish it I gotta tear it down

[Outro]
2 Corinthians 10:5, yeah
The power of the gospel
Persuasive truth baby
(Capture Every Thought)
We Preach Christ
(Capture Every Thought)
We pray so hard man, (Air Tight)x2
We're men of faith
Idolatry and false arguments don't stand a chance
