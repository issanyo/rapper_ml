[Intro]
Anything you could do I could do better
I can do any I can I can do any I can I can do anything better than
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
I can do anything better you

[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Lego! I was the man on guard yeah couldn't tell me nothing
Smooth operator mic check pushing buttons
Seeking fame I was insecure somebody love me
Going backwards in my life call me call me Benji Button
Seek what I want yes sir got to have it
I don't care who it belongs to baby I'm a grab it
Coveting another undercover it's a habit
Tragic how this envy can turn you to a savage
I can do anything better than you
I wish I had what you had just a measure would do
Come bite the fruit ya it's good sin severing you
And now your wife ain't good enough any new one would do
Or your car or your job yeah your life seem wack
If it is the good life you still wanna give it back
But envy is sin and it will take charge
So don't be blind to the key like your boy Ray Charles

[Hook]
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
Better than you better better than you
I can do anything better than you
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
Anything better any anything better
I can do anything better than you

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, Tedashii, my verse is...(better)
Yeah...
Look now I been doing this a lot lately some undercover hating
A brother progress I give no congratulations
Maybe it's because I want the spot God gave him
Supposed to make Him famous while I wanna defame men
Crazy compliments are hard for me to say
I can't stand the thought of someone else getting praise
Wanting all the glory for myself what a shame
In the end it's really in vain like heroin
Check who I'm addressing no Vera Wang buddy
I thought we was supposed to be the same team funny
The Pharisees said Jesus did the same thing
When He tried to point 'em to the Father
On the tree's where they hung Him
Mark fifteen ten, yeah, see the heart of that sin
Only way to beat it through repentance and confession
Men fight for your joy killing discontentment
If you be satisfied in the sufficiency
Of the Lord then you are loving the next man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KB]
They ain't heard my verse yet...
Let's just admit it.... I'm better... hahaha
Simply you having more than me just offends me
Sends me after that capital like the Shift key
I'm Nevada, Sin City in the state of envy
You get it right? Like the the Ne... Whatever
They trying to be rich less I'm richer than you
The fun in number 1 is the point that I'm up in front of 2
I hate it when praises go to another dude
I grind to the T (teeth) to stay in front of U (you)
They should of put me on we raw..
You feeling me though right? Okay
They should've put me on me raw for eons
I'mma need my compliments with E-S-T or E-R
It's best or better when it's prime time I'm Deion
That's why I get excited when I heard you slipping off
I'm a B alphabet but I ain't been alpha yet
Then I realized I had it all wrong like Malcolm X
My entire life is entitled tied up and tired
Trying to acquire these titles with a wire for something higher
Messiah

[Hook]
