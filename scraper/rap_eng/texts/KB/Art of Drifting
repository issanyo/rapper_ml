[Verse 1]
You don't love the church no more
You don't love the church no more
You don't wanna serve no more
You just love the perks homeboy (yeah)
And countin' money from your merch homeboy
Ticket ticket ticket tickets (how we do it)
Ticket ticket ticket tickets
And we ain't got time no more
God is not God no more
He is just a job homeboy, oh boy
Where did we get off and where did it all go wrong?
(all go wrong)
We stop talkin' Jesus as soon as the mic is off
I had a dream last night, this is what I saw (yeah)
You can build a Christian empire without God
Livin' for the bus, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Breakin' out the cups, yeah, yeah
Hennessy by the tub, yeah, yeah
Loosen up, yeah, we ain't in the field no more
Just the dugout now
How you living?
Did you turn God to your little business?
Who cares? I'm winnin'
And now I gotta go on

[Vamp]
How y'all feelin' tonight?
Make some noise for Jesus, yeah

[Verse 2]
You are getting worse homeboy
You are getting worse homeboy
Play the church, take the birds home
Never hear you talk about the word no more
Except when you tryna defend your dirt homeboy
My God
You done let your eyes go
Started fornicatin' with your iPhone
She keep her body too tone, then vitilago
Send emoji eyes those
Said that you would never bite though
(Too smart for that)
'Til she showed up at the show in the front row, row
Probably would've panicked
But you gone off that zoloft
Wearing the same outfit that you left that comment on
Sayin' one thing to the crowd
But in your mind takin' her clothes off
Went down in the DM (told her)
Pushed the flight back
Knock on room 103 and
Came around, 1:03 a.m
Wait, uh-oh, hold up, she in, wait
Wait, where your wedding ring at?
Wait, can you keep a secret?
Can't believe it, my God
Yeah, how are we here?
Crucified Christ again that's that double treein' at the Double Tree
How many ended like me here?
Oh, not one did
You were dead before you checked in
You've been driftin'
Nobody wakes up addicted
Every great fall's from 100 bad decisions
Whole legacy passed, you just no-looked it
Lost in the sauce, didn't know you're slow cookin'
Remember when you didn't wanna be alone?
All you talk is numbers
Took the filters off your phone
When you stopped callin' on your pastor when you got home
Spendin' more time with Instagram than the Son of God, oh God
Miles from the shore now
Wifey left with both of the boys now
Daddy, daddy, daddy why you let it go down?
Was mommy not enough for you to hold out?
Tell me where we gonna go now
I don't wanna be here
I was just a man last weekend
Can I be a king after Bathsheba?
But David never danced again
He limped all the way to [the end]
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over, it's over
