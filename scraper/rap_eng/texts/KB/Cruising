[Verse 1]
Now lay me down to go to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die and I don't wake I'll be better than those who ain't
26, I'm a cool and an intelligent hooligan
Native American nubian, cruisin' with deuces in the whip
Yeah, they call me KB homes, I ain't talkin' real estate
Never wanted fame, I was taught, "Eat what's on your dinner plate"
I don't care 'bout bein' big and such and such, I'm in the faith
Think I'm reppin' Oklahoma, no matter what I'm still OK

[Interlude 1]
I'm still OK
(Ride with me, ride with me, ride with me, ride with me)
No matter what I'm still OK

[Verse 2]
Rollin' with my partners all through Tampa, feelin' like a boss
HGA behind me, I mean drivin', and I'm on the AUX
Take me to my hood so I can get that shrimp and garlic sauce
Let me go see my mom before you drop me off
Look, I remember just turnin' 'bout 13 I promised
I thought it was over, I'm losin' it all
I was ridin' my bike and then crossin' the street
And then, hit by a car
My head went through the windowshield
They pumped their brakes, I'm in the air
Knew they thought that I was dead
But that ain't what my father said

[Interlude 2]
I'm still okay, I'm still okay
Fractured a couple bones, but I'm still okay
I'm still okay, God had a plan

[Verse 3]
Uh, there was a boy
There was a boy on the same day
That got in the same exact accident
In the same hospital
And he never would walk again
What if it was me with the broken neck? (the broken neck)
If it was over then?
I'm afraid of what happens next
Livin' like you'll never die, you'll die havin' never lived
Worried over making ends meet, forget you'll meet your end
I'm afraid of dyin' but my death I almost welcome it
Approach it like I do my bed, that's just how I enter it
Got me draped up and then dripped out
Streets paved in that 500k
While He's throwing my sins out
No regrets, just righteousness
And I can't wait to be like him
Life only gets better boy
With eternity on your eyelids
Imma sleep well, it's been settled boy

[Outro] (x2)
I'm still okay, I'm still okay
This gon' be a good night
I'm still okay, I'm still okay
And we gon' go to bed fine
