Yeah, AK second letter with my range though
Yeah, I feel fly as TSA in plane clothes
Itsy-bitsy rappers swear they kings though
Sun came out and dried up all they rain though
I sound cloud high
Streamin' a track and you can spot the fire emoji
Cause I'm livin' all I got
Boy, I'm really livin' more than sentimental
Put it in the middle of a instrumental
Every jot and tittle from my brother, pencil riddle
With the riddles of my Father's vision
Boy, I know you heard me go off
Sorry for all the hold up
In the lab now with COBRA
Tempo, tempo, tempo
Homie, that's my quota
The album comin' soon

Puttin' in work, young T Chef up the stove though
I pull up in all black with the Rose gold
Microphone loaded weapon, spit a real rap
I just wrote this from the soul so I know you feel that
Put my life inside these bars, yeah
Metaphor a murder charge, uh
Metamorphosis, I still evolve
Write the sound of heaven, higher power
Light the valley, really I just hold the torch
I'm a freedom writer speak my peace up in the fire
I got angels all surronding just to hold me down
Yeah, hold me down, yeah
I'm a young wavy Memphis, raging shawty level up

[Verse 3: KB]
Oh, we just strange, full of grace, all my gang
Oh, HGA to the grave, that my faith, yeah
Jesus is allegiance here, won't pick apart a piece of this
The piece is His, when everybody wanna leave it here
We leanin' in, we eatin' here, that's it
We ain't great, but we ain't fake at all
Talkin' CHH to create faith in bars
Homie, we don't play like EA games
And we take aim to see they change to free they pain
We say "gang", but we don't stain
The key to...
