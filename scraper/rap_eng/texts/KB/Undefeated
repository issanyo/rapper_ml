[Verse 1: Tauren Wells]
Struck down, persecuted
Under pressure, man that's how we do it
We at war, we at war
But have you even looked at the scoreboard?

Scoreboard, scoreboard
W's all day, whatchu scared for?
Scared for, scared for
Ain't nothing comin' at us
That we ain't prepared for

[Hook: Tauren Wells]
Undefeated
There's no stopping us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're rising up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
We're undefeated (5x)

[Verse 2: Tauren Wells]
I'm countin' my losses up as wins
'Cause Jesus be three-peatin', beatin' my sins
Nah, the boy ain't talkin' 'bout rings, ain't worried 'bout the bling
I been crowned by the King

March, madness, cuttin' down the nets
While I'm marchin' past my past with no regrets
And I'm steady lookin' to the hills like The Weeknd
In my weakness, grace is sufficient

Infinity and 0, Infinity and 0
And you already know

[Hook: Tauren Wells]
Undefeated
There's no stopping us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're rising up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
We're undefeated (KB get 'em)

[Verse 3: KB]
I ain't takin' no L's
Singin' Noel in the summer boy
I ain't wanna go there, but oh well
'Cause we don't loose for nothin' boy

If we decease, indeed we will be again
Angels and demons, neither these heathens can
Ever get in between, I believe that we will win
Know the end like I cheated
Can't guarantee it, but Jesus can

Runnin' on Yom Kippur, this the fast track
On Yom Kippur, this the fast track
Even when they hatin' on me, homie I don't get mad
I just keep spittin' these glad raps

I came, I came, I sought, I sought
Conquered all, across the chart
And altered y'all, break off the wall
Hinges drop them off, taunt and flaunt
But homie all will awe (all will awe)

Flawless, flawless, flawless, God of all this
Is appalled with y'all installments of heartless altars
As they fall apart when God is faultless
Infinity ending the enmity between God and me, killin' the darkness

[Hook: Tauren Wells]
Undefeated
There's no stoppin' us
Undefeated
No doubt we're champions
Undefeated
Can't hold us down, we're risin' up
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know
Infinity and 0, unstoppable, you already know

We're undefeated (5x)
