[Verse 1]
You might be the favorite part of me
You're my season, Summer, Autumn, Spring
I wonâ€™t hold back you get all of me, oh
I'll come running when you call on me
Over mountains, underneath the sea
Bet your bottom dollar I will be here
I'm going through pictures in my phone of you
I can't wait to get home to you

[Hook] (x2)
Good morning to you baby
When I fall, I fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
I'm watching you sprout right in front of me
Wonder what your life will come to be
When you look back I will be behind you
And when I'm old I pray that you will find
Daddy left you all you needed
I love you with my soul, now baby you go
Oh, I hate being gone from you
Caught a red eye to get home to you
So I could sing...

[Hook] (x2)
Good morning to you baby
When I fall, I fall in love with you

[Bridge]
Let the horns play
Horns play
For KBJ
All my fathers can relate
Let the horns play
I'm going through pictures of my phone of you
I can't wait to get home to you

[Hook] (x2)
Good morning to you baby
When I fall, I fall in love with you

[Outro: KB & KBJ]
You know that feeling when they, when you hold 'em for the first time
This what my heart would sing
Thank you for grace, God, and babies
Say papa, papa, papa, papa. He can't concentrate on me. Almost
Papa
There you go!
