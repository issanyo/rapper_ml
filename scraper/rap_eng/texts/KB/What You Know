[Chorus]
What you know, what you know
What you know, what you know (K to the Second Letter)
I'm the GOAT, on the boat
I'm the GOAT, on the boat

[verse]
Listen that's Primetime, coming live in the nighttime
They don't feel us, get a high-five
Southside, recognize my type
Wanna charge light, catch me outside, (Woo!)

Cause the dream won't die
We gon' do the work, if they leave that's fine
I can't feel the air, but I'm breathing fine
?
(Cause I got the, I got the wave)
