[Intro: Taya Smith & KB]
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever you would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever you would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
I am yours, and You are mine

[Verse 1]
For Jesus, let me tell you 'bout me
I'm not impressed easily cause I've never been a place that my God don't reign
No way, no way, HGA to the grave
Gave all himself
All I wanna do is give him all of me, all of me, all of me, all of me
Struggling, oh, I be struggling
My idols are mimickin' Jesus
I bury my sin in 3 days, it's back up again
In the beginning we, in the beginning we, we would give anything
Value for ministry, missions, and bigger things
You could take everything you just give me the King
But the fire faded
I just wanna retire with savings
Are you the safest when the world loving you or had enough of you?
Who's in more danger, the persecuted or the comfortable?
Give us a crown
You can hold onto them thorns
I don't want them having more
Nobody will suffer no more
Only say things that will end with applause
Don't offend no one except for the Lord
No mas, you are too good to be throwin' your cross
I'm at the cross, do what you want!

[Bridge: Taya Smith, 8x8 & KB]
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
I am Yours and You are mine
I am Yours and You are mine

[Verse 2]
How does a man stay on top?
Become the servant of all?
When you the servant of all, no competition's involved
Cause who is knocking you off? There's nowhere left to fall (uh)
Progressive with the flow, that's a little one
As I'm insured, I'm sure you're missing these little puns
I'm insured, yeah, the settlement is finna come
He's still shining if I'm jacked for every nickel, son
Cause no way I'ma die slow, no way I'ma die slow
Won't break, I will not fold
Cancel my tour, not my soul
I'll go blindfold in and out of time zones
I'm in my zone, put it up on your iPhone
Leaving your mind blown, looking for his arrival
I can see Him ridin' down all on that white horse
Looking like OJ in the bronco
And I'm learning when I've flown
Flights make my respect much stronger
The higher that I go in grace, everything below is smaller
I'ma steward this well
He holds my airways, I breathe with a heavy flow
Forevermore, yes I'm willing and able
Like I'm sittin' in an exit row
I gotta make an exit though
What will they remember though?
How I was born? How 'bout my metaphors?
Man of war standin' in truth and I was serving strong
Bring it, they can throw violence
I'm in the back grinnin' like Joe Biden
He rose the ocean, Poseidon
To be frank, no ocean I won't dive in

[Outro: Taya Smith]
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever you would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever you would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
