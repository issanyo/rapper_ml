Lyrics from snippet:

[Chorus]
Run it back
All '19, listen
They gon' have to hold me back (aye, yeah, yeah)
They gon' have to hold me back (hold me back, yeah, yeah)
They gon' have to hold me back! (hold me back)
Yeah, I'm on really on God
Yeah, really on God, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ask me where my Roley at
Can I ask you where your soul is at? (Yeah)
'Cause they get funny with that holy rap (Right)
'Cause I could do this all day, though
My homies call me Thanos
'Cause that brother only snap
And I'm New Era when they only cap
South side and they lift you up in the holy plant
I like Jesus, I like Jesus over phono track
Different world, better preach it
[?] get him cash
And the boy looking like [?]
Just run it up, I got [?]
Won't you go and get another round, they gon' have to dumb it down

[Verse 2]
I don't dumb it down
I be getting 'em like God
Really living on on the sentimental
Put it in the middle on my instrumental
Every child and tempo from around the pencil
Riddle with the scribbles of the Father's riddles
Let me get a griddle, can I cook a little with theâ€“
I see 'em, I tell 'em I am not fighting, boy
Jesus coming back and I am not playing, boy
You love the money, ain't looking too favorable
Blood on my hands and then I'll say what I say to you
Promise that I ain't a [?] through her
And it's unbreakable
You better make a move
She gon' take what you own
I never switched up, I never ditched us
When they ditched us, I made them flinch up
Ask my sister, we don't give up
Ready to die for the Truth that clinched us
You can't bench us, get your weight up
