[Intro: Perfekt]
Sideways

[Hook: Perfekt]
Sideways, came in this thing sideways
Get turnt, get lit sideways
Haters lookin' at me sideways
Sideways, sideways
I ain't slept in like 9 days
Heard they be talkin' sideways
Leanin' in this thing sideways, sideways

[Verse 1: KB]
Better believe I bust with 'em, tell 'em to come get 'em
Try to keep up with the speed in my Jeep and dust with 'em
Enter, enter the vicinity, youth into the injury
Pistol poppin' with the pen and pencil, I guess it's [?] to infinity
Enemy entities couldn't hit to me
Got a better chance doin' a handstand on a bed of glass
With both hands, for the broke hand with about four man
Throw a coke can with a coke hand
With a moped from mo' glass
You get the picture, no chance
But I won't stand, I'm real boy
Pinocchioin' in the forecast cause I'm focused
I'm head about to go in
Hold the ego amigo, why you so PO'd?
Don't forget that this male can box, that's no PO
But no need papito, macarana with the chico
Man, I got mind control over Deebo

[Hook: Perfekt]
Sideways, came in this thing sideways
Get turnt, get lit sideways
Haters lookin' at me sideways
Sideways, sideways
I ain't slept in like 9 days
Heard they be talkin' sideways
Leanin' in this thing sideways, sideways

[Verse 2: Steven Malcolm]
Yeah, let me talk to 'em
You see the aim ain't the money and fame
But who's to blame, but the game and way I was raised
I put the shame all phased, they got me blind man
But now truth got me lit, turnt up sideways
A lot of times, man, I hate my ways
All the sin I gotta kill, Lord, mend my ways
Pride pumped up, Lord, come deflate my ways
Without you there's no growth like ay I praise, now turn up!
Given it's only for the glory, homie, given the honor to Abba, Father
My provider know that Alpha and Omega spirit inside of me
Honestly, probably properly shiftin' me up into His property (ha)
Let's get it shawty, what more shall I say?
Cause, bruh, we gon' turn up all day
Super saiyan, turn up, kame
Goin' in for the king, turnt up, insane
Sideways

[Hook 2: Perfekt]
Sideways, came in this thing sideways
Get turnt, get lit sideways
Haters lookin' at me sideways
Sideways, sideways
I ain't slept in like 9 days
Heard they be talkin' sideways
COBRA got me rockin' sideways, sideways

[Interlude: KB & Hollyn]
Came in this thing like
Came in this thing like
Came in this thing like
Came in this thing like, like
Sideways, sideways
Came in this thing like sideways
Came in this thing like
Side, side, side, sideways
Sideways
Came in this thing like sideways, yeah
Came in this thing like
Sideways, sideways
Came in this thing like sideways
Came in this thing like
Side, side, side, sideways

[Bridge: Perfekt & Hollyn]
Sideways
Came in this thing sideways, sideways

[Verse 3: KB & Hollyn]
Oh, man, I'm underestimated
Underrated, underrated
Came domesticated [?]
Look at the squad, elevated
Staircase, and never take it
Segregated lovin' like the talk of God has raised us, affidavit
Eyes wide [?] but you know I ain't playin'
Gotta give it up for the rhetoric [?]
I'ma line it all up in the hole in your head again
Better late than never, never let a [?] get you some medicine
Messing with them idols you'll be left with the deficit
Finna get it sideways, rip it might just give it to me sideways
I'ma need everything that my saviour intended for me
If they don't think you strange then you know we missin' the key
Normal's offensive to me
Normal's offensive to me
Sideways, sideways
