[Intro]
Yeah
Spazz
Yeah
Uh I make them spazz
Good work Charlie
K to the second letter
Yeah spazz
Spazz out spazz
Spazz out spazz
Spazz out spazz
I make them spazz
I'm about to spazz on em
I'm about to spazz on em
I'm about to spazz on em
Let me get this for a sec
Yeah yeah

[Verse]
Okay now truth knock in my speakers
I'm young wild and in Jesus
Got my mind set on his kingdom
He made room for us like Ikea
Mida, we livin la vida
Not a sip of macaita
My sisters don't want franklins
Boy you better come with aretha
My homies doing it and I know so
Missionaries, firefighters, popo
Every city across your globe
Courageous men that won't fold
We 2012 Justin Martyrs, Martian Luthers
We live and breathe that
Hallelujah (you know)
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
I'm the type of brother get up on the microphone
And give it you like I never had before
And you know this
I don't think that hear me though
Reject me but I'm 10 deep
And I bet we spazz out when we ready
Somebody come and get me
That gospels known to regulate, resonate, renovate, recreate, resseruct
Ain't no feather weight
Heavy metal melt away cause he rose check the petals
They thinking they a beast
You nothing he can't domesticate

[Outro]
Spazz out spazz
Spazz out spazz
Spazz out spazz
