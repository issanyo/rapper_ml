[Intro: Crowder]
Kick 'er off Wichita
Haha

[Verse 1: Crowder]
There is calm then there is storm
There is peace then there is war
There is love then we are torn, oh Lord
There's a void then there's a song
There's a death then we are born
There is blood then we are home, oh Lord

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're free, prove it
If you're free, prove it
If you're not, lose the chains on your soul
Come, freedom

[Verse 2: Crowder]
There are slaves and there are kings
All are bound 'til they are free
All misplaced then they believe, oh Lord

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're free, prove it
If you're not, lose the chains on your soul
Come, freedom

[Verse 3: KB]
K to the...
If freedom is free as they say it is
Where we go where they displayin' it?
We wanna start where the chains end
Is the promised land up for the takin'?
No one is free on them slave ships
Only a slave would enslave men
Egypt is still in our nation
It changes faces, face it, who liberates them?
I'mma need more then they payin' me
I don't need money, I need a key
I'mma need eagle wing liberty
Free indeed, hidden deep is a plea
I rather die than be steeped beneath tyranny
Just like I got it, I give it like oh
Grace to the nations, no hatin', you know
We integrated, we be interracial
You lovin' your neighbors then go let 'em know

[Chorus: Crowder]
If you're free, prove it
If you're free, prove it
If you're not, loose the chains on your soul
Come, freedom
