[Intro: Anelisa Motaung & KB]
You know what I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm going to do?
I do it
You, you, you, people have been talkin', man
You know what I'm going to do?
Ima just do it
Ima just do it
I do it (let me get some more vocals, yo), Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it (turn me up though)
Ima just do it
Ima just do it

[Verse 1: KB]
See the pretty young girl
At the church, maybe black, maybe Spanish (I ain't know)
Had a little vocal, only in the choir
Says she loves Jesus, and she has good credit (oh, Lord)
Few months in said, "I'm makin' you my wife, cutie"
She smiled and she asked me, "How?"
I said, "Shh... (Ima just do it)"
You been datin' that girl for like, huh, six years though
You livin' by faith or are you livin' by your fear though?
Oh you gotta be faithful, homie, ain't gotta be amazin'
Put a ring on dat girl like Muhammad Ali did to Laila
Like Fridays and Ezel, tell everybody that we will just do it

[Bridge: Perfekt]
I see what you doin' and that don't excite me
Get out of the way, I'm not askin' politely
I'm so 'filiated, I'm so 'filiated they know who the squad be (1-1-6, 1-1-6)
We do what we want, they too scared to try
So (Ima just do it)

[Hook: KB]
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
No hesitation, with no time to waste
And I promise, I promise that (Ima just do it)
Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it
Ima, Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it

[Verse 2: KB]
Dang, look, I'ma go in
Everybody stay down
I'ma go in, my dogs on both sides like a Greyhound
Bust flows, no pass
Wayne left Rikers Island in a phantom
That's pretty cool
But 'Crae went and preached the Rock of Zion
Same day was on Fallon
Number one album lookin' like (Ima just do it)
Ain't gotta make sense homie, you gotta make faith
Faith the only thing that make sense
The only type of life in this life that is really worth livin'
Is the life that will go and take risk
Ima go and be it, gimme my Jesus
You don't believe it, your man will, Jada Pinkett
Too many years trying not to rock the boat
I gotta quote, "I don't wanna rock the boat, I wanna sink it"
Ima just do it

[Bridge: Perfekt]
I see what you doin' and that don't excite me
Get out of the way, I'm not askin' politely
I'm so 'filiated, I'm so 'filiated they know who the squad be (1-1-6. 1-1-6)
We do what we want, they too scared to try
So (Ima just do it)

[Hook: KB]
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
No hesitation, with no time to waste
And I promise, I promise that (Ima just do it)
Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it
Ima, Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it

[Break: Bubba Watson]
Lemme talk about how I'm supposed to be a Christmas party right now, but y'all keep keepin' me in here. My wife's not gonna let me be on fleek if y'all don't hurry up!
(Bubba Watson)

[Verse 3: Bubba Watson]
Bubba Watts on the mic now
Can a golfer spit a rhyme?
Not a gangsta rapper, but my caddie got a nine
KB need a verse?
I told him, "Ain't nothin' to it"
Everybody ask me why, I just look 'em in the eye and say, "(Ima just do it)"
Country boy from the panhandle
Country boy from the panhandle
No golf lesson, just God's blessin'
Nothin' He can't handle
Left-handed, money swing
Driver's pink, ain't nothin' major
Got two masters, no double major
But one Master, I praise and thank Him
I do it!

[Bridge: Perfekt]
Okay, okay
I see what you doin' and that don't excite me (no, no)
Get out of the way, I'm not askin' politely
I'm so 'filiated, I'm so 'filiated they know who the squad be (1-1-6, 1-1-6)
We do what we want, they too scared to try
So (Ima just do it)

[Hook: KB]
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
I do it, Ima just do it
No hesitation, with no time to waste
And I promise, I promise that (Ima just do it)
Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it
Ima, Ima, Ima, Ima just do it
Ima just do it
