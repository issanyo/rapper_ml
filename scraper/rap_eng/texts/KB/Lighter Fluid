On that, on that lighter fluid
On that lighter fluid
On that, on that lighter fluid

[Verse 1]
All things movin' are by, for, and to Him
Born in Mary but Mary was born again through Him
Peace between the two, God and man, deuces
He removed the curse, this is censorship music
About His Father's business, ironically He was Jewish
Pisces horoscope can't touch what he did with them two fish
He's so fly, sinners wanna shoot him
Stranded on His relationship, carnival cruisin'
You don't wanna go toe to toe, with the one who's runnin' everything
Better hit them knees and forgiveness please
Go and get a little bit of truth ask him plea(x2)

[Verse 2]
Jesus is God, all of y'all are not him
One God known for the three, John Stockton
Run this play, handed off to Christ no option (football)
You can't pay your way, put the quarter back in the pocket
Narrow minded, headed straight, already in a better place
Sin gotta leave my head, DNA
I'll take an insipid place as long as my sins have been erased
I'm shootin with a Canon get the picture,scripture

[Verse 3]
I got a little more
Salvation is a gift but most men'll sleep
Or try to get it at the last minute like Christmas Eve
We are sick in need,I believe, anti-histamine
Is in the trinity,not your any way genegies
Check my symmetry, I'm balanced in the ministry
Simply livin' before the cross like Gethsemane
My enemy's enemy is Divinity
Endin' the enmity in between God and me, is you feelin' me?
Higher than I ever been,always tryna represent
Introducin' light to this world like Thomas Edison
Like ed knife, fall away? Yeah right
My inheritance is sealed, you can say I'm heir-tight
Live in community, I don't do islands
The Lord's army doesn't enlist privates
I preach one way,I pray that you trust in Him
It's black and white, He removes the gray like Just For Men (Get it?)
He was just for men, atonement was just for Men
He won't fit in your schedule I suggest you adjust to Him
