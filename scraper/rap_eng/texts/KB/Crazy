[Verse 1: KB]
He the man already
Got the plan already
In His hand all ready
Stop trying to be fly, you can land already
Face up off the floor
Actin' like you got no hope
Why you so downcast on my soul?
We digging out this slump
Let's go!
He's claimed and forgiven me
Man was an enemy
Grab your identity
You are not likes, retweets, follows
Fans or the mentionings
What you need with validity
When you be claimed by the Trinity
Quite literally
Who I need to know when almighty God is a friend of me
I know what you're saying but
I know what I'm feeling
I don't think I'm gon' make it
I'm so low
Self pity
Still pride in self, Really?
God like boy you got help with me
Wealth, with me
No Hell, Really?
Wanna be great?
Take the e and put it after the t and add 'ful' to it (grateful)
You're breathing love beyond reason
No reason to be salty in any season

[Hook]
Late night dinner with our silhouette
Table for two, Yet I'm talking to myself
Trying to figure out what I'm dealing with
Am I going crazy
I'm going crazy
My soul, God is always with us
Let go, You got to remember
Get up, Stand up
No, don't you bring me down
No, don't you bring me down
Get up, Stand up
No, don't you bring me down
No, don't you bring me down

[Verse 2: KB]
Can a brother get a break?
Can a brother get a break?
Anxiety driving me cray
Can a brother get a break?
Can a brother get a break?
Nothing ever works for me
And I know it always could me worse for me
Earth's curse in it's work hurts, irking me
But when it all be imagined like Mercy Me
I'm sorry
Did I miss the meeting where you decided your plans for you?
You ordained the number of fans for you
You got something better than what He prepared for you? (Me?)
Stop with comparing dude
If no one else is aware of you
Remember that God is a fan of you
And cares for you therefore you covered in blood that is rare
My dude
I know everyone seems more advanced than you
But that ain't your business
You stay faithful lift your head and move
Turn up, turn up
Your best days are still ahead
More God, thatâ€™s more than that false list of more important things
You wanna be great?
Take the e and put it after the t and add 'ful' to it (grateful)
You're breathing love beyond reason
No reason to be salty in any season

[Hook]
Late night dinner with our silhouette
Table for two, Yet I'm talking to myself
Trying to figure out what I'm dealing with (what we got here)
Am I going crazy
I'm going crazy (with God on my side)
(KB) My soul, God is always with us (Yeah, yeah)
([?]) Let go, You got to remember (c'mon)
Get up, Stand up
No, don't you bring me down (God with me)
No, don't you bring me down
No, don't you bring me down (Cobra)
No, don't you bring me down

[Outro]
God with me (x3)
No, don't you bring me down
God with me
No, don't you bring me down
God with me
No, don't you bring me down
God with me, God with me
