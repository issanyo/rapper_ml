Woah I'm that suicidal lunatic/ All these drugs I'm losing it/ Don't ask for the old d brooks he's fuckin dead and ruined bitch/ Catch me in the cut with my girl I call her super chick/ Super ass super tits some shit that'll have drake viewing this/ Give me a reason to not fuckin snap/ Dressing in black with a gat to my hat/ I just might pull it and watch you react/ And fright all of you fuckers that don't cut me slack/They asking me why I sound suicidal/ Crucifixes when I step in arrival/ Middle finger fucking all of my rivals/ They jocking my style/ It's holy like bibles/ Catch me in the darkness I'm plotting don't know which way to go/ Cuts on both my wrist sitting watching white bitches doing blow/ She say that she love me she lying can't trust a single soul/ This world turned me cold my heart black with rage reaper took my soul/ She think that I'm crazy/ I'm calling her baby/ But this ain't my lady/ You like nirvana..well lucky for me hah I tell her to rape me/ Tired of waiting/ I'm back from the dead bitch and nobody saved me/ City need saving/ Looking like its some patients time for resuscitation/

Day in and day out gotta get this fucking cake now. Took ya bitch and then I eat her like some motherfucking Chinesse take out. I did it all on my own so you what the fuck these niggas gotta say now?
Vibes ,We  finna take off like we on a motherfuckin plane now. All I see is rats like I'm in a subway, all I know is money
,pockets fulla tubmans. Count  up the 20's stash away the hundreds
Shoot a fuck nigga like I going huntin. Sending shots at me but then I dodge em. Talkin shit on Twitter won't pay yo rent  with all them comments. I'm Not a cocky nigga Man, I just gotta keep it honest. The kinda drugs that I'm on,You hit it once it  make you feel like you Nostradamus I'm a shark in the water you niggas piranhas. Taking shots like I'm the black mamba
