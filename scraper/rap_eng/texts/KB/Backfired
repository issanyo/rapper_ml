You know lately I feel tired
Keep my head up but feel uninspired
Like everything I've desired
Lost its meaning and backfired
​
I walk around this small town
And I always dream of going out
They look at me like I'm a clown
But that's better than settle down
​
Sure I always talk of leaving
Guess that's why you can't believe it
Have a guitar to say my feelings
That's pretty much for what I'm living

You know lately I feel scared
And I always act like I don't care
It's not the first time that I just stare
Just to be pain spared
​
Sure I always talk of leaving
Guess that's why you can't believe it
Have a guitar to say my feelings
That's pretty much for what I'm living
