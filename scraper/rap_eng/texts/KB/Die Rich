[Intro: KB]
I came, oh, I came (I came, I came)
With nothing, with nothing
I came with nothing
But I fought for something
And I'll leave with everything
(Go, go, go, go!)

[Chorus: KB]
Yeah
Homie, I got that glow I cannot hide it, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I got Heaven printed on my eyelids
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I’ma die rich"
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich"
I got that, uh, yeah, finessing with the kindness (Kindness)
What they talking about?
We're forever financed (Financed)
I’m thinking, "Whoa, we the ones to die rich" (Die rich, die rich)
I'm thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich" (Die rich, Die rich)

[Verse 1: KB]
Aye, just the queen and I, I'm Martin Gina vibes (Yeah)
Didn't need a dime to know that we arrived (No, no)
HGA the law that we abide by
Bye bye, got *NSYNC with Him and came alive, yeah (Alive, alive)
Told my bro that it ain't what you make, it's what you keep
He told me, "Bury me in Louis sheets!"
Uh, run it up (Run it up)
Run it up, run it up, run it up (Run it up)
Double up money, they leveled up
Bet it up, let me just sum it up, money just not enough
Audemars, Audemars, bust down, yeah
Money dance, money dance, touch down, yeah
Adonai not impressed and you gonna die
What am I gonna bribe God with a hunnid' dollars?
Hunnid’ times I’ma tell you how to levitate
How to put stocks where they never sink
End the day in the faith, give away anything
Any day, it'll pay many more in the Name
Woo, yeah, I’ma die lit (Die lit)
KB, KB charged up, I've been indited
Yeah, I'm the baby daddy with no side plate (No side plate)
Yeah, my BMW's like the i8
Winning, winning, eternity is underneath my eyelids
So every time I close my eyes I just get reminded
Just turn the lights off (Turn the lights off, turn the lights off)

[Bridge: KB]
I came with nothing
But I fought for something
And I’ll leave with everything
And that's all I'll ever do
(Go, go, go, go!)

[Chorus: KB]
Homie, I got that glow I cannot hide it, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I got Heaven printed on my eyelids (My eyelids)
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich" (Die rich)
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich"
I got the, uh, yeah, finessing with the kindness
What they talking about?
We're forever financed (Financed)
I'm thinking, "Whoa, we the ones to die rich" (Die rich)
I'm thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich" (Die rich, die rich)

[Verse 2: KB]
All my friends were buying Louis
All we wanted was some Gucci
Keep our closets stocked with brands
That we don't own a stock or two in
God bless the entrepreneur
Pastor taught me how to steward
Cooking bars, Martha Stewart
Business deals and flipping units
I was taught by Martin Luther
Get the bag, but don't abuse it
Every dollar, we accrue it
Belongs to God and not the jeweler
Jesus, Jesus help me through it
I will not be young and foolish
Cash rules nothing 'round me, homie, just Yeshua
Is it crazy thinking we give more to people than ourselves?
Inheritance for my children or our wives that never fail
If my businesses go under and my property don't sell
Did it for the Kingdom, served the people and my soul is well (Yeah)

[Chorus: KB]
Homie, I got that glow I cannot hide it, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I got Heaven printed on my eyelids (I got)
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich" (Die rich)
Thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich"
I got the, uh, yeah finessing with the kindness
What they talking about?
We're forever financed (Financed)
I'm thinking, "Whoa, we the ones to die rich"
I'm thinking, "If I die tonight, then I'ma die rich" (Let my little brother go)

[Verse 3: Ray Emmanuel]
If I die tonight, homie, I'ma die rich
No, I ain't talk about the money I get
Only 14 years old, but I set my goals
And I don't really care about diamonds and gold
It's all about what's inside your soul
I don't wanna go down that wrong road
Materialism can make you a victim
And put you inside the mass of the prison
Put in the physical work and that spiritual work
'Cause life'll make our spiritual hurt
I'm not the best, but I'm not the worst
I do what I can to please God to come first
So money is cool, but when I die I'll be a millionaire times 2
God is the answer, Who's stronger than cancer
The Master is waiting on you with the juice!
