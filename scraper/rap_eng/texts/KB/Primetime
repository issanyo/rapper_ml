[Hook: Ty Brasel]
Yeah, yeah, woah

Now it's time to grind

Never stay down
Yeah, jump back right it's primetime
Primetime, yeah, I took them losses
Now it's time to grind
My momma told me
Never stay down, yeah
Jump right back it's primetime
Primetime, oh primetime

[Verse 1: KB]
Goya packin
All I wanted was a La Toya Jackson
Started college at age of 15, reppin'
They say, "Young K, you'll be a corporate savage"
Jehovah snatched me
And I laid it down like 21-0 in madden
And I took some losses
But I know that they didn't damage
Man, that's supernatural, I'm madd organic
No, that's Google Map on you, I got direction
Don't get advantage when you been abandon
Nothin' handed, daddy wasn't comin' back
Yahweh, Padre pass the calamari
All He need is nothin' to bring something back
That's just a humble fact
I see L's like new Lexus
And every loss I gain like the bench press
I'm not even looking for no new lessons
Suffer now, in Heaven I'll be countin' blessings

[Hook: Ty Brasel]
My my, I took them losses
Now it's time to grind
My momma told me
Never stay down
Yeah, jump back right it's primetime
Primetime, yeah, I took them losses
Now it's time to grind
My momma told me
Never stay down, yeah
Jump right back it's primetime
Primetime, oh primetime

[Post Hook: Ty Brasel]
Took a L
Jump back right
Deion, Deion, Deion
Yeah, it's primetime
Took a L
Jump back right
Deion, Deion, Deion
Yeah, it's primetime

[Verse 2: Ty Brasel]
Prayin' hands, mama, prayin' hands in the bedroom
2 AM, 3 AM, bended knee, you
Held me down always held me down, I was reckless
Pourin' the fo', swallow the Xan with my breakfast
Young and wildin', young and wildin'
I remember blasphemin' God, cash fiendin' hard
Hash demon, raw, trash treatin' broads
I'm a pitiful, poor, blind, naked, wretched, and redeemed man
They say, "T, you got the sauce and the seasonin'"
Cause I'm Thomas Brady with the comeback
When you used to strugglin' you know how to jump back
Just took another L, okay, I jump back right
Yeah, Deion, Deion, Deion, yeah, it's primetime

[Hook: Ty Brasel]
My my, I took them losses
Now it's time to grind, yeah
My momma told me
Never stay down, yeah
Jump back right it's primetime
Primetime, yeah, I took them losses
Now it's time to grind
My momma told me
Never stay down, yeah
Jump right back it's primetime
Primetime, oh primetime
