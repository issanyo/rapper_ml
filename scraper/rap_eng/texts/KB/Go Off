[Intro]
You think bein meek is weak, huh?
Try bein meek for a week
Ain't that right, Shai? Ha!
I go off

[Verse 1: KB]
I go by K to the second letter
But my name is a second matter
Give me a second
I'll bring you from Cain to the second Adam
For His fame, boy, I'm up and at 'em
For the pain, boy, I'm up to bat
And patient for the win cause we win slow with these family matters
Ah, ah, I'm so convinced
That you won't find no bolder men
Than those of them that's goin' in for holiness
God goes with them
What you know about goin' harder?
Walk with me through these martyrs
And fathers, dead for they Father
For the Father, boy, don't get me started
Let me try to break it down
I thought I'd be doin' it if I moved a couple pounds
Made a hundred thou, bunch of women in the house
But that ain't doin' nothin' but f-f-following the crowd
Everybody's doin' what everybody is doin'
You cool with doi'n the opposite of everybody's doin'
You goin' hard for Yeshua, you goin' hard in the truest
I promise

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
I'm goin off
Goin harder than I've ever been
I put that on everything
I'm goin off
Goin harder than I've ever been
I put that on everything
I'm goin off (for the glory)
I'm goin off (of the King)
I'm goin off (it ain't for me)
G-goin off (it's all for Him)
I'm goin off (for the glory)
I'm goin off (of the King)
I'm goin off (it ain't for me)
I'm goin off (it's all for Him)

[Verse 2: KB]
I was a hothead, bad attitude
Woulda, coulda, shoulda been shot dead (ok)
Always runnin' my mouth
I'd rather die then be soft, man
I've been slammed on my back just to prove that I'm not scared
(Turn the other cheek), stop playin
'Til I met Jesus and really seen just what He's about
He endured the cross, to kill 'em all woulda been the easy route
When I first got saved had a dude come up to me, talkin, tough to me
Wanted to duck and swing but I walked away, that was the tougher thing
See a Godly man acts different when he's been wronged
He knows how to overlook offense like a peepin' Tom
Easy to smoke your problems away with that Cheech and Chong
It's hard take 'em head on, who mans up before the Lord?
What about the brother that discovered that his lover was under the covers with another man? (That's hard)
With everything inside of him he wanna go and body him but he givin' him grace instead (That's hard)
What about them brothers who are wanted by multiple women but they married and they know they gonna be there
For their children so they willin', they livin', they've faithfully given they wife everything?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tedashii]
I go off, hard for this
No holds barred, good Lord this it
No arguments, keepin' my cool
Faith on fire, no arsonist
It's hard to miss, 116, yeah
Unashamed, rep it mayne
Even when they disregardin' this
I told you g-go hard for this, ah
I know it's tough when your eyes and your mind seek lust
And your pride is a must
And the lies rise up to skies, what's what?
And you feelin' like quittin' cause what you tried ain't enough, ah
That's when you take heart
God got it, still God
Harder, harder I go for the Lord
Go hard 'til the day I depart, ah
Go harder for the Father even if it means I'm martyred, assaulted, departed
Doesn't matter He bought us
He chose us and called us somebody planted and watered
All these seeds He increased with ease bearin' fruit like trees
Breathe (ha) breathe, breath in my body
Of the King, I'm a product
Chance is slim without Him, I'm saltless
But He called us, all us, guaranteed He got us
So I live in His name, give Him the reigns
Even when I know the temptation is tryin' to slip in this thang
It's so much easier mayne to give in to sinnin' like men and the many of women I know who caught up in chains
Steady livin in vain and they sin with no shame
Man they stuck in the prison until they meet up with saints
Who be bringin' 'em change, yep all in His Name
Until they unashamed

[Hook]
