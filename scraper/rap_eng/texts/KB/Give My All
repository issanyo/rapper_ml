[Hook]
I got 100 different reasons
100 different ways to go
And they say I'd never make it
Baby I’m already home
100 that’s the only way I know
And they said I’d never make it
They don’t know who I’m working for
100, 100, 100

[Verse]
Look, I ain’t down with my feet up
I don’t care where you bury me brah
Running hard till I drop
So bury me in my free runs
Funny how I don’t want the stuff people dream of
Rich living in a beach front, eased up with my E's up
So what if they think you the man
That don’t mean nothing in the kingdom
So what I want ya’ll to remember me for
If you forget my name, please remember my Jesus
They can have it all, we content
I know they tripping over nothing, this a horror flick (It's empty)
I know how this ends like I authored it (we win it)
That’s why I’m waiting on my Savior like he's ordering
Time after time, I wish I could get time back
I’ve wasted so many years I can’t rewind now
But God is over time, I ain’t talking a tie
He runs the clock, call it time lapse
You can’t go back to the future, now your futures back
401K where your future after your future at
Go invest in it, and give your all
Cause life is short but eternity is long
Yeah, that's why-
Can I, can I
Get a little ignorant with
Boy I'm feeling this
Killin' this yeah I'm still legit
And I'm going in
(Hol' up) I know God watching me
(Hol' up) I know they watching me
(Hol' up) If it glorifies the King
I'm like dame ven aqui mira
I’m a be looking to keep whatever you put us through
Given us everything cuz you know we got a mission
I know they don’t get it but gotta go with the vision to do everything we doing unto the one who has given us life
Its all cool we passed bars like law schools
100 my dogs don’t do 50 like Ja Rule


[Outro]
I got 100 different reasons
I give my all, 100
I give my all, 100
I give my all, 100
At the end of it all
That’s the only way I know
That's the only way I know
