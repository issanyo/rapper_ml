[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
What you wanna do, act loco?
Hit 'em with the old to the flow
That I grew up on then I grew up on
I'm funny now how I flow for Hova
Heh, words twisted, but you know I'm sober
Never really been the type to pour up
When I get this thing going I don't like to slow up
Mouth moving like a motor when I bite the flow up
But I bet they won't stop let me go let me go
Woo! I'mma show off every ability God's giving me to go off
And ainâ€™t nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and tabernacle
So, when I'm rapping you can add it in
Breaking 'em with the shatter
They're gonna wanna put me in a place with padding
I'mma damage 'em every time like a player that's on the cover of Madden
God be the original, we brag
Look at Him

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
I feel like I'm Paganini

[Verse 2: KB]
Uhh, lemme do it
K to the second letter
Finna get it popping
Coming out the pocket like oooo!
Everybody get to rocking doing the Paganini
Killing the beat, my tongue is like a violin
Give it to them like I'm not a human
When I'm doing what I'm doing, keeping it coming like an automatic shooting
When we get to ripping it ridiculous
And everybody gets to speaking about these riveting brothers that's going in again
But they don't know, even when they got that flow (when they got that flow)
I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed
Look, producers, directors, skilled architects
Just do what they do to whom they're connected
True was the God that chooses to bless them
Who is the one you think they reflecting

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canon]
Canon, Yo, hey Andy, okay
So down for my clique, shut up, y'all corny, oh shoot, shut up
I've been itching to stick 'em up with this killer Canon coming to cut 'em and hit 'em harder Ooh kill 'em
Hold up, I've been hitting everything up in me like I'm Paganini
Hitting every rhythm like a milli chopped ya
I know you heard Twista, and Tech-a-Nina hitting ya but Canon's original
I'mma Midwest Monster, Kill em!
Blaaaat! blaaaat! Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline
Coming to drill em with real gospel
Coming up to the game
Still the same
Bringing the name
Bringing the fame
To the glory they follow Him and the father
While I'm coming and killing the game
I'm breaking 'em off and we know
They steady tryna imitate the steelo
I'm hitting with fire, spitting super wild
Running with the young and unashamed
I'm Paganini on a kilo amigo

[Verse 4: Eric C. The Tempa Tantrum]
"It's that
Colorado Demon Killa comin' to kill every demon up inside of yo body...
Reppin' the name of The Name Of The Father in Heaven when I be covered up in the blood dat drippin' to attack illuminati..          Steppin' up into the party and pullin' out a fully automatic weapon that  be ready for whenever you thinkin' that you be ready go to war witta brotha from Colorado because I'ma hittem up witta million bullets (Yeayuuuh)

Tantrum" feelin' the Holy Spirit up inside of me, demons betta get ready to ruuun

Ain't nobody that be stepping to the Father, gotta get rid of any demon that wanna argue rippin' the tongue up outta yo mouth, you lookin dressed to kill, gotta Columbian neck tie for you
Already knowin' that we be winning, copping the "W" to the wisdom of the Father Father in Heaven given His only begotten to be crucified on the cross for my sins,couple of days later arisen
