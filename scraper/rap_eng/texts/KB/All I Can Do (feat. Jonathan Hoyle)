Verse One

Alright the albums finished now it's time to relax

Sike I'm already working on my new one face facts

I decided to close this out with a chill one I'm writing this to reflect

I wanted to let my ideas out and let y'all know how I feel

I found it's hard making an album when you have no time

I can't wait til I'm out of school and can do this on the dime

10 cents is all I've really seem to made but it's ight I can live with it as long as I Make an impact

I figured I could write this and make it the last track

People are gonna ask for a stack but friendship is the one thing they lack

I admit I'm not always right, I wanna do things my way

But I know I gotta trust the process

Get rid of anything excess

Things change you just gotta accept

People are gonna hate on me either way except when I shut them down no wait they still here oh Lord bless that

My lifes a mess that God still works on everyday

And the chorus sings



Hook (2x) (Jonathan Hoyle)

I went out with the old

Came in with the new

I'm doing what I love

It's all I can do



Verse Two

They been tellin' me to keep it chill

But I'll only keep it real

I got different views from y'all

Only wit the ones who been through it all

My problems seem big

But I know they all small

They say I sound repetitive

All y'all do is be negative

Maybe y'all need a sedative

I know I'm blessed

But sometimes my life is a mess

Sometimes I got that stress

But it's all good bc Ik who's the best

It ain't me it ain't you

Playin' life like a game of pool

Yeah that living water is so cool

It don't matter how much the girls drool

I'd rather be criticized than praised by a fool

Call my haters animals bc all they do I talk bull

Not gonna cuss so I'll finish that line off on a stool

Lacey's the girl of my dreams, her mom didn't lie when she said I have a jewel



Hook (2x) (Jonathan Hoyle)

I went out with the old

Came in with the new

I'm doing what I love

It's all I can do



Bridge (Jonathan Hoyle & Greg Hartley)

People say we changed up

But now we got our pay up

Forget what people say yeah

Do you, never worry bout the haters



Verse Three

Growing up I was told I'd never make it

When I got hurt I had to fake it

Started off singing I had to Drake it

All this time made me patient

Went through a drought my mind was blank yeah

Now my entire team got a blanket

This upcoming year is mine. Best believe imma take it



Hook (2x) (Jonathan Hoyle)

I went out with the old

Came in with the new

I'm doing what I love

It's all I can do
