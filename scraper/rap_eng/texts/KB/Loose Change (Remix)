[Intro: Joey Jewish]
Initial D
I do it for my team
Woo

[Verse 1: Joey Jewish]
Quick to pull my trigger
Got spare clips inside my Supreme
Bape from crown in hill, I got that sizzle like a rare meat
Oh no when I run up on a sucker tryna dare me
I came back from Paris feeling foreign like my girl be
Pull like a V, we gon' treat you like P
Back of the line you ain't standing with me
Don't need a hand when I get it for free
Did it myself and you won't get a piece
I took that loose change from my pocket and I came up
Say it's triple-digit figures or I'll hang up

[Pre-Refrain: Joey Jewish]
Call it what you want but I bet you'll never tame us
I feel it coming like a main buzz

[Refrain: Joey Jewish]
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Put it in the slot, triple seven on the dot

[Verse 2: KB]
I just got the vision, 20/20, already planned
I can narrate your whole story, Morgan Freeman
AK-Second letter, I am crazy wit' that range though
I feel fly as TSA and I'm just wearing plain clothes
I get the check and I cut it up
Invest it right back in other stuff
You do not want it with none of us
Little bit, little bit, little bit
Kingdom is looking phenomenal
We don't want "good", but "phenomenal"
I think the crowd going nuts
I need a top hat and a monocle
What you call a icon livin', whoa
Yeah, he got an icon denim, whoa
And I'm on that fight called livin', whoa
Snapping like a Nikon in him, whoa
You could really swear I'm in the kitchen, whoa
Gordon Ramsay, so explicit, woah
I don't need a nice job with it, whoa
You can't son me, God did it already
I'm irrelevant, right?
(I heard what you thought of us)
Rosa Parks wouldn't give up her seat
So now I tour with the bus
(Whaaaaaat)
Now I tour with the bus
(Skrrt skrrrt)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: KB]
Loose change in my pocket how I came up
Yeah, loose change in my pocket how I came up
Yeah, yeah, they just told me "chill out with that faith stuff"
Yeah, yeah, please get out my office with them lame dust

[Refrain: Joey Jewish]
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Put it in the slot, triple seven on the dot
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Loose change from my pocket, how I came up
Put it in the slot, triple seven on the dot
