[Verse 1: Royal Ezenwa]
These dudes they hating us
These [?] they [?] us
They stacking up that false hope
They lost souls, they laugh at us
They attackin' us, they cray
Because they don't really feel like [?] us
Asking us just live it up
Don't [?]
Don't blow up now, hol' up
Won't turn down, turn up
Passing up that full cup no drink but we still serve up
To be on that livin' water, no Nemo, we on the most high King Jesus
Not mean we spit it like [?]
Young dudes with [?] (wassup)
Tattoos and snapbacks (wassup)
That [?] and back packs
That narrow road we fast track
That gospel dawg we pass that
We got the wheels and we the [?]
We brag and spit for the King who died for my sins let no [?]
[?] we passed that
And YOLO's such a no-no
And we livin' twice and our soul glow
Bro I'mma live solo
Live for the King but they don't [?] us
[?] because they don't [?] us
[?]
Unashamed [?]

[Verse 2: Princeton Marcellis]
Time out, time out, [?]
Blindfold, I've seen what I've seen where the King's at
Brrrap
Where the beans at
Can I get a say when they leave that, back
Better change my [?]
God glorified and I'm in to that
With these bad back raps I spit that [?] like a Green Bay fan
I ain't even worry with what you thought of me or tanking me
I'm just thinking what your thinking, Jesus I pray You take up me
Now I'm so gone
I'm free
Off the chain Django
Say look dead it's the same old
[?] it's resold
[?] my emotions
When my problems come I'm still hopin'
Saying God has spoke out life ain't metaphor
Moses split the ocean
Tell 'em I'm B-O-C 'til I D-I-E He came for me and now it's devotion
To the cake I eat 'til at least 'til the old people are struggling

[Hook: KB]
So they say you young (they say you young)
Live your life (live your life)
Do what you want (do what you want)
I think they right
So they say you young (they say you young)
Live your life (live your life)
Do what you want (do what you want)
I think they right
So they say you young (they say you young)
Live your life (live your life)
Do what you want (do what you want)
I think they right
So they say you young (they say you young)
Live your life (live your life)
Do what you want (do what you want)
I think they right

[Outro]
So they say you young (they say you young)
Live your life (live your life)
Do what you
