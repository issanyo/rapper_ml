[Intro: KB]
Oh why!
Oh why Oh why
Oh why you so serious
Why you always gotta a problem man
(it’s not good)
Oh why you so serious

[Verse 1: DA' T.R.U.T.H]
It’s saturday morning I'm up and I'm yawning
But still kind of out of it
A knock on the door well it’s a Jehova
This time I'm not dodging em
But this time I'm invite them in
Am hoping that I'll be quick
And boy I just better be
I just spent six months
You searching these counterfeits
This ain’t a matter for personal taste
Providing different I shared the debate
I've seen peaceful discussions that turn into hate
How bout them topics divide us
That drama divided church and the state
Sex and divorce they’ve got questions about it
Abortions and babies that’s birth out of rape

[Hook: KB & (DA' T.R.U.T.H)]
Oh why Oh why
Oh why Oh why
Oh why you so serious
Why you always gotta a problem man
I'm here to go oh no not again
Oh why you so serious
(Why y’all so serious)
Why y’all so serious
(We all need to lighten up)
We all need to lighten up
(All I keep hearing is) yeah yeah yeah
(We all need to lighten up)
Can’t find no fear in us
(They all got us fired up)
Now I'm just curious
Why you so curious

[Verse 2: DA' T.R.U.T.H]
My manager called with an interview
I told him give me a second (wait a minute)
I don’t wanna talk if there's gon be trivial questions
I just wanna go to colleges and sit on panel discussions
Get in on whatever
I don’t wanna spend twenty minutes talking about [?]
Too much going on for the talk to be superficial
The people are hurting and maybe that’s to hell to deal with
Deep rooted issues let’s get to the heart of it
The talk is too small I guess
Let’s get into something deep I never have to sign another autograph (yeah)
Got off the stage and a girl just walked up to me
With tears in her eyes she broke down and cry
Said man I no longer wanna live
Another one came she grew up in the church
Said I don’t know what I believe in
Another came and said would you pray for my friend
She keep cutting and I don’t want her to bleed

[Hook: KB & (DA' T.R.U.T.H)]
Oh why Oh why
Oh why Oh why
Oh why you so serious
Why you always gotta a problem man
I'm here to go oh no not again
Oh why you so serious
(Why y’all so serious)
Why y’all so serious
(We all need to lighten up)
We all need to lighten up
(All I keep hearing is) yeah yeah yeah
(We all need to lighten up)
Can’t find no fear in us
(They all got us fired up)
Now I'm just curious
Why you so curious

[Verse 3: DA' T.R.U.T.H]
Who left that open door
Supreme court is doing exactly what I talked about
Enough hope war I need a mental vacation
But how can I take it when I just saw standing ovation
From people that just literally sold their soul
At the temple of satan huh
Still need a reason why
He dressed like the Joker and shot up the movies
And innocent people die
Guess he was in his feelings
Church shooters and there’s campus killers
Media they will not call it hate
They just keep saying it’s mental illness
Ouchhh! People are panicking they need us to answer them
If I don’t put truth in my music
They gon go to the streets and get it from faracons
So why be so serious life is too troublesome
People are dying from hunger and thirst  why would I give em bubble gum
I wish I could [?]  but I do not want that blood on my boots
I will not [?] I just want them to see the sun again
I just want them to see the sun again
