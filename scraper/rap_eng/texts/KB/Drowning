[Verse 1]
Trap
It's a trap
Been a trap from the start, boy
You don't trust lies, do you, do you?
Then why you trust your own heart?
(Do it, click it, feel it, drink it, pull the trigger)
It's the last time
Same thing that you said last time brethren
We forever drinkin', but the thirst is never leavin'
Searchin' the earth for what you only find in heaven
So insane

[Hook]
Tell me, can you catch me, I'm fallin'
Tryna make my way to the shore, but I'm callin' out
I'mma be gone by the mornin'
I can feel the end comin' now
Don't let me drown, throw the raft
Before I drown pull me up now
Before I drown, pull me up
Before I drown
(Can You save me now?)
'Fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me 'fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me

[Bridge: Natalie Lauren]
I can feel the water all around my head
Around my head
I can feel the waves all around my neck
Come, won't you, come, won't you
Come, won't you, come here

[Verse 2]
Hollerin' YOLO!
If tomorrow we may die, shawty
Then the kid 'bout to play
We need to plan house parties
I know how it feels, at 15 I ain't wanna live
I was at the bus stop, ducked down, sparkin' up the spliffs
Thinkin' if I die tomorrow no one care
Followin' these rappers
Brag about my status
Am I makin' people jealous?
I know I ain't happy
Never found joy, I could only find distractions

[Hook]
Tell me, can you catch me, I'm fallin'
Tryna make my way to the shore, but I'm callin' out
I'mma be gone by the mornin'
I can feel the end comin' now
Don't let me drown, throw the raft
Before I drown pull me up now
Before I drown, pull me up
Before I drown
(Can You save me now?)
'Fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me 'fore I drown
Save me from me, save me from me
Save me from me, save me from me

[Outro]
Oh, He saves
Let Him become your life
Feelin' like you gone too far or you're too far gone
Oh, my Lord loves your type
Feelin' like you runnin' out of answers
He wants you right there
God only helps those who can't help themselves
Behold the beauty of the King of the pleasures unseen
From the desert of me to the meadows upstream, drink
There is no feelin' better, never won't be satisfied
Supreme, everyday no fleeing, I'm safe
