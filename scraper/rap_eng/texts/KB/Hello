[Verse 1: KB]
Hello
What do you do when the guilt doesn't cease the morning
After a fall, crying Lord would you send relief
Relief, relief
Depression is setting in
Constantly feeling down
What's this really about?
I'm recommitting the sins I feel most guilty about
I'm weak
Spiritually my bones sticking out
I want holiness, but I ain't got the power to live it out
That's why I gotta preach
Cause the gospel it gotta hit me
Jesus has died for my sin
There's no power without belief
Believe

[Hook: Suzy Rock]
Oh, I'm letting go of my yesterday
Grab a hold free in your grace to live
There's no more guilt
I know that I've been forgiven
Hello new mercies
Hello every morning
Every day I live
Is another day I know that I've been forgiven
I know that I've been forgiven
I know that I've been forgiven

[Verse 2: KB]
After life, there's a judge that we face
With no Christ, then the lawyer is bringing a brief case
Guilty
But not for those who are truly underneath the grace
That's making me chase knowing my sins have been erased
After we stray, we see no point in praying
I can't go to God, I'd rather hide â€˜cause he's angry, what?
Who told me that? The Gospel lifts me from my fall
I have no sins to pay; Jesus has paid them all
That's why I preach
Better get that Gospel to me
You see the power indeed is available through belief
Believe

[Hook: Suzy Rock]
Oh, I'm letting go of my yesterday
Grab a hold free in your grace to live
There's no more guilt
I know that I've been forgiven
Hello new mercies
Hello every morning
Every day I live
Is another day I know that I've been forgiven

[Bridge: Suzy Rock]
I am His
He is mine
Bought with the blood of Christ
Every sin
On Him lay
I'm spoken for
No condemnation
I am His
He is mine
Bought with the blood of Christ
Every sin
On Him lay

[Hook: Suzy Rock]
Oh, I'm letting go of my yesterday
Grab a hold free in your grace to live
There's no more guilt
I know that I've been forgiven
Hello new mercies
Hello every morning
Every day I live
Is another day I know that I've been forgiven

[Hook: Suzy Rock]
Oh, I'm letting go of my yesterday
Grab a hold free in your grace to live
There's no more guilt
Hello new mercies
[Hello every morning
Every day I live
Is another day I know that I've been forgiven
