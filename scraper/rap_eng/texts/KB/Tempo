[Intro]
When I placed all my burdens on him, he washed them all from me
Ok, let's go
All the way up, way up, way up, way up
All the way up, all the way up, all the way up
All the way up, way up, way up, way up
All the way up
K to the...
All the way up
Second letter
All the way...

[Verse 1]
Jiggy witty kid with his own style
Chillin' in the city, we should simmer down
Comin' from the Grammy's with a semi-smile
Cause we done had more fun servin' people in the city, ah
Let the window down
Go and let the beat knock
Squad is in the house
Smash your windows, I call it Steve Jobs
We ride, we ride, atta boy
I'ma go Bobby Boucher in the city
Handin' out that livin' water, boy

[Chorus 1]
I just hit my rhythm, boy
This is not your tempo, boy
I just hit my rhythm, boy
This is not your tempo, boy

[Verse 2]
HGA, it's simple boy
Louie Free, he with me, draw a crowd, no stencil boy
They got Drake to play it safe, I think they conned him
I love God, do what I wanna
Got to deal with it, wheels spinnin' and I still live it
Never chill with it, still winnin' in the field with it
Put the real in it, no concealin' it
Point to Him with it, every spill with it
To the Hill with it
For the kill with it, You could still get it
How a Seal feels in the field
Its is sealed in us
Really ain't no fear in us
Really ain't no fear in us
You might wanna get with us

[Bridge]
Way up, way up, way up, way up, way up
All the way up, way up, way up, way up
I am as free as my hair
Cut it or comb it, forget it
I'mma do what I've been called to do, not what's expected
Just for the record, just for the record I know

[Chorus 2]
I just hit my rhythm, boy
This is not your tempo, boy
I just hit my rhythm, boy
But this is not your tempo
This is not your tempo, this is not your tempo
Don't nobody own us, don't nobody own us
Don't nobody own us, don't nobody own us

[Verse 3]
Pull up to the meetin' with ripped jeans and Adidas
The new intellectual what you seein', homie
We can go toe-to-toe with any summer
So we got a pen game and we just bowling' dawg
Explicit as ever, vicious as ever
Christian and clever, diss it, dismiss it, this is just better
Vision is better, makin' high art
But high art can't revive hearts, I'mma do this God talk
Don't need a pity party, my people pity ya party
The party I'm a part of imparts partials of pardon
Can't pick apart any part of the picked apart
They won't part with it
I played the artist, now pardon, I brought my partners in
I think I know what we revealin'
Life is over, easy, everybody's shell cracked
Holdin' my dignity, never sell that
We got bigger fish to fry, no way to scale back

[Chorus 3]
I just hit my rhythm, boy
You can't match my tempo, boy
I just hit my rhythm
And you can't help but fear love

[Outro: KB & Nancy Honeytree]
Think I found it, I think I found it
I, yeah
I think I found my rhythm, boy
Think I found it, I think I found it
Not one blemish does He see
When I placed all my burdens on Him
He washed them all from me
