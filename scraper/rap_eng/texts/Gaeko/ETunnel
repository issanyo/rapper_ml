Korean (Original)

[Verse 1: Oh Hyuk]
까만 밤 속 새어 나온
의미 없는 불빛들은
알 수 없게 주위를 밝혔지

[Verse 2: Oh Hyuk]
조용했어 다들 그래
다해봐서 그런 건가
다들 잘해 참는 거 하난

[Chorus: Oh Hyuk]
Are you ok? Cause I'm ok
Passing tunnel we are
Are you denying? the fact we are
We growing up once again through the scars

[Refrain: Oh Hyuk]
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me

[Verse 3: Oh Hyuk]
어느 샌가 주황색의
물길들을 흘려 보내
무심한 듯 적절히 수놓아

[Verse 4: Oh Hyuk]
그래 우리가 언젠가
맞닿음을 알게 되면
걸어가는 중인걸 알까

[Chorus: Oh Hyuk]
Are you ok? Cause I’m not ok
Passing tunnel we are
Are you denying? the fact we are
We growing up once again through the scars

[Verse 5: Gaeko]
다들 잘 스며 들어서 사는 것 같아
오 나는 분리되는 일을 반복하는데
아픈 상처 받은 후 아무런 배움이 없을 땐
술이 몸 속 터널 안을 지나 구석구석 깊은 생채기를 내 (sign said)
여긴 위험지역 당장 속도를 줄이시오
어떤 의사는 경고해 이젠 술 좀 줄이시오
도로 위를 무심하게 굴러가는 무거운 쇳덩이들
내 마음도 그렇게 되나 봐 연거푸 쌓이는 잿더미들

[Verse 6: Oh Hyuk]
또 우연히 말이 통해
뭐 인연인 줄 알았지
나는 그런 오해를 좋아해

[Verse 7: Oh Hyuk]
손으로 세몰 만들어
햇빛에다 빗대보면
그럼 마음이 한결 편할 거야

[Refrain: Oh Hyuk]
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me


English (Translated)

[Verse 1: Oh Hyuk]
Meaningless light seeps out
From the black night
Mysteriously shining around me

[Verse 2: Oh Hyuk]
It was quiet, they were all like that
Maybe because they’ve all done this before
They’re all good at holding it in

[Chorus: Oh Hyuk]
Are you ok? Cause I’m ok
Passing tunnel we are
Are you denying? The fact we are
We growing up once again through the scars

[Refrain: Oh Hyuk]
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me

[Verse 3: Oh Hyuk]
Suddenly, I see orange waves of water flowing down
Laying it down just enough
As if it doesn’t matter

[Verse 4: Oh Hyuk]
Yeah, some day
When we come in touch
Will we be walking?

[Chorus: Oh Hyuk]
Are you ok? cause I'm not ok
Passing tunnel we are
Are you denying? the fact we are
We growing up once again through the scars

[Verse 5: Gaeko]
Seems like everyone is doing fine
But things keep separating for me
After receiving painful scars, when there is no lesson
Alcohol passes through the tunnel in my body
Making deep scratches in each corner (sign said)
This is a danger zone, slow down right now
Some doctors warn me, cut back on the alcohol
Heavy steel parts rolling around meaninglessly on the highway
Guess my heart’s like that too, heaps of ashes build up

[Verse 6: Oh Hyuk]
When I coincidentally clicked with someone
I thought it was meant to be
I like those kinds of delusions

[Verse 7: Oh Hyuk]
If I make a triangle with my fingers
And look at the sunlight
I feel like my heart will get calmer

[Refrain: Oh Hyuk]
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why always me
Why me why me
