[Intro: DΞΔN]
Love-love the stars
Love-love the moon

[Verse 1: DΞΔN]
Nothing’s really different
It’s the same air
It’s the same bed
Looking at the same ceiling
Why do I feel so empty
For no reason at all
It’s been a few hours
Since I’ve been spacing out

At first
I thought I was just hungry
No way no way no way
These days
I listen to Kanye’s new album
But it’s just typical

I leave the TV on
But I’m just flipping the channels
But bae, there’s not much meaning

[Chorus: DΞΔN]
Nothing comes even close
To half of you
It can’t fill me
It doesn’t fill me up, yeah
Just half
If only I had just half of you
Then I wouldn’t feel like this

[Verse 2: DΞΔN]
On a night without you
Even when the moon is up
I can’t see it
It’s hidden by thoughts of you, yeah

Just like you can’t make a fair call
If your heart is slanted
Just because you’re not here
There’s no way I should be like this
But I keep going back to those times

In the place where you used to be
I can see the night sky
That half-full moon
Looks just like me right now

[Chorus: DΞΔN]
Nothing comes even close
To half of you
It can’t fill me
It doesn’t fill me up, yeah
Just half
If only I had just half of you
Then I wouldn’t feel like this

[Verse: Gaeko & DΞΔN]
If tomorrow’s darkness
Takes one bite of the moon
Then our world that we made
Would become smaller too
Only longing will fill it up
After I spend a boring day
When the full moon rises to the sky

When we used to go around
Saying that we were one
I didn’t know it’d be so clear
That you are you and I am me
Time to think is up
Is what it feels like

If more time passes, I can’t ask you to come back
Just like Don Quixote
I’m crazily dreaming of your love
If only I can see your eyes
I would be able to fill up my empty heart

[Chorus: DΞΔN]
Nothing comes even close
To half of you
It can’t fill me
It doesn’t fill me up, yeah
Just half
If only I had just half of you
Then I wouldn’t feel like this

[Outro: DΞΔN]
Love-love the stars
Love-love the moon
Nothing comes even close
To half of you
If only I had just half of you
If only
