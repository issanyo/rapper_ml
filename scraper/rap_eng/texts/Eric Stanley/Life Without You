[Verse 1: Nay Nay]
Never thought that I would meet somebody like you
Perfect appearance with personality too
You’re the type of person that everybody pursues
So when I got you for myself felt I had everything to lose
Held you close, it made me blind not to notice
All those times we spent together I was not your focus
Hard to get it through my mind that you were not devoted
But I guess it wasn’t hard for you knowing the path you’d chosen
At first I felt that I should blame myself
Every time you did wrong you blamed me as well
Manipulate each situation just to put me through hell
And training me to feel at fault every time that you yelled
It’s so ironic, cause you were so demonic
But I only saw the best in you, I guess that it’s symbolic
For how ni’eve I was, I guess I should have used more logic
But I only wanted love you only wanna be psychotic, I got it

[Hook: Bryan Mahon]
If I could still love you
The way you want me to
I wouldn’t be confused
My mind is doubting you
Need to stay or move
But either way I lose
So now I’m left to choose
To live my life without you

[Verse 2: Nay Nay]
It’s just lovin' and losin' or it’s just nothin' at all
I drew myself to conclusions but it just left me appalled
I know that love’s an illusion with some confusin delusions
Which had brought the solution that I should not get involved
But you drew me in like I was stencil
Tied each blood vessel to my heart into a pretzel
Toyin with emotions while you messin with my mental
Wishing that I had a loaded 45 next to my temple
It’s actually quite simple
The way you think is wrinkled and twisted
Where to start? I had your heart, but quickly became your victim
In a cruel love game full of sick and wicked witches
You tore my heart in half and left me bleeding without stitches
How can you be a goddess When you never kept a promise
You're just sneaky like a snake and as vicious as the Loch Ness
Fictitious stories got you wrapped up like them chocolates
So you can kiss our love goodbye, can’t do a thing to stop this

[Hook: Bryan Mahon] x2

[Bridge: Bryan Mahon]
If I could still love you
The way you want me to
I wouldn't have to choose
To live my life without you

[Hook: Bryan Mahon]
