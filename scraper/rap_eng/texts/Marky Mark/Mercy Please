My rap is nothing but the truth, so God keeps let me spittin'
This game is like a marathon, there's no need to be sprinting'
Pack the bowl, roll to the left, and let your homies get a hit
You're all brothers in Arms, when shit goes down, your real friends will not split

Martin had a dream and at that time that dream seemed crazy
The world got better, the world got larger, and now the future's hazy
I could rap against the world and put them into a mental bind
But i'd rather spit at home and smoke that Carolina Pine

I show no mercy on the mic, all day all night, I'm the almighty light
Don't get it twisted, I am no God, but God told me that my bars are tight
Versus that burn to the third degree are nothing more than you perceive
Let it be known that I am the King, I have no throne, I got people to lead
Yet people say that i'm nothing more than a  stepping stone that sets them forth
But take me lightly and i'll be forced to make you knock on Heaven's door

I set them up in a reasonable fashion, lock n' load and their dreams start crashin'
Everyone knows that your sore out of luck
You may have raised the bar before, but now the bar is stuck

Controversial lyrics, but no one seems to care
I got the feds on up on my ass, where the fuck is this Laissez Faire
All it takes is a broken pose, and the whole world knows that what you compose, is nothing more than broken flows. Now the  door is closed and your left behind as someone else's fame grows
I only rap about the truth, it is the path that I have chose
