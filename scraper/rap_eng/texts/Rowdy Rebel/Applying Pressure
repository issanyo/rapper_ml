[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
It be them same niggas you was down for
Praying on a nigga downfall
But that's why they want you around more
Bought them extra rounds for
That shmoney got a nigga paranoid
My shmurdas ain't tryna hear that noise
Kill that noise
Go and kill them boys
That shmoney talk
And I don't hear them boys
And I'm Rowdy bitch
The only Rowdy bitch
I'll beat a nigga with a hockey stick
And this my style
I ain't copy shit
I'll teach these niggas how to body shit
Now niggas think they body shit
Until my niggas go and body shit
Cueno make a nigga body flip
Mollied up on some Gotti shit
Matter of fact, on some Rowdy shit
Cause way before I was rapping nigga
I was clapping niggas on my Gotti shit
Now I'm on my 'lluminati shit
Oops, I mean my Makaveli shit
Tatting 'Thug Life' on my belly bitch
Now a nigga on your television
I'm worldwide, you can't tell me shit
Cueno steady in [?]
Tryna take what a nigga did?
Step back and pull a nigga wig

[Verse 2: OnPointLikeOP]
30 shots all in the 6
Kill a nigga
Then kill his kids
The trap house where my niggas live
And that work steady
Yeah coming in
Hollow tips in this MAC
He try to run?
In his back
No shoelace
We take straps
And none of my niggas act
Okay like all this money and violence
Free Rowdy and Bobby off the island
Even though they locked a nigga got 'em
Even though they locked a nigga got 'em
Like 4 5s in that 6
We spinning blocks in this bitch
And head cracks we don't miss
And head cracks we don't miss
Okayy
