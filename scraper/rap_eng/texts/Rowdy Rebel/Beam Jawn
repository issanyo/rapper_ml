[Verse 1]
Niggas say we make drill music
Stupid nigga we don't do that, we just spit the shit that we live nigga
(Blow Blow) Yeah we do that!
Hop out then we shoot back
Crako  go spin the coupe back, blue steel on that new mac
Tell him "Grab a 40, go use that"
Thats ya' bitch, get your boo whacked
When I (Brr), nigga better (Brr) back
Cause my ahh ahh ahh niggas shoot that
Screenshots get your crew clapped
They like "Chill Bobby, why'd you do that?"
Pussy nigga should've knew that
Beam jawn make him move back, send shots to a niggas bulls cap
Pull out, better pull that
Talking shit like they all that
Take all my niggas on a field trip, and tell my niggas "Go and kill that"

[Hook]
Beam Jawn (Red Dot, Red Dot!)
Beam Jawn, beam jawn, beam jawn (Red Dot!)(Blow!)
Beam Jawn (Red Dot, Red Dot!)
Beam Jawn, put it on his beam jawn (Red Dot!)(Blow!)
Beam Jawn (Red Dot, Red Dot!)
Beam Jawn, beam jawn, beam jawn (Blow!)
Bean Jawn (Red Dot)
Beam Jawn, beam jawn, beam jawn put it on his beam jawn (Surprise!)

[Verse 2]
Some pussy nigga started
Beam jawn on his beam jawn, red dot him while he parking
And if the D's come, put that beam jawn in the back seat and park it
If he tell my niggas take the keys out, 50 shots a sergeant
With the police got a bail release and I ain't trynna' bargain
Beam jawned your party
Beam jawned your shorty
I got beams on the .40's
The type that'll drop your shorty, call it Robert Horry
Freaks just caught a body, cause we don't know karate
I just bought a new gauge, put beams on the shotty
Free murder out the cage, and free my nigga Gotti
I miss my nigga Kane. No backyard parties
Show up to they place, and put beams on they mommy's (Gang!)
