Pookie, girl I might bust a juice in your eye
Tell her go and get a room key, girl Imma get a room for us
Hit me, she told me bout my groupies
Girl that’s just groupie love
Then I told her bout my two seat
And who I had in my two seater
I was rolling like I'm Drake from Degrassi, I think I’m fancy
I won’t let em feel this cash me, I let em pass me
A nigga all about that cash see but if you ask me

[Verse 2 – Rowdy Rebel]
Late nights, great sex
She came first, I came next
Fucking up this telly
Watch the walls in this room sweat
Took a train, I called a jet
Tellin' niggas come correct, Abilly’s home so cut the check
Put a foot on nigga’s neck before a nigga disrespect I disconnect a nigga’s neck
Took a trip out west just to help me with the stress
Girl excuse me for my foolish thought cause I’m just getting used to you
Before we grab this bite, grab a room for ya
I swear to keep it true to ya
Because true was all she knew before she met me, now it’s two of us
I got her riding in the newest stuff
I bought the Bentley coupe, baby girl says she wants the Beamer truck
Fill her tank up, I fill her bank up
Kiss her, make up, we always break up
Girl look what this world do to us
Let’s go and get lost baby, I got a room for us
