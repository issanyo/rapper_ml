[Intro]
(Girl he got Shmoney) And that's a fact
Shmoney, Shmoney, right here, right here
Bitch on it bad bad
Try niggas, ain't  shit go change with this Shmoney nigga
Money our lifestyle dog

[Verse 1 - Rowdy Rebel]
Gang, we still in tall which is all shit
But now I am feeling like a boss bitch
Put my gang on on some ball shit
Am still drinking Balel, Amaror shit
Don Perignon in the morning
Early in the day, that's how I start it
And to the game, we still charge it
Burn 'em cop, state park it
I put that "shmoney on the target
(Now a target, Now a target)
And to the top, that's how I target
(That's a target, that's a target)
Burn those chocolate smelling start shit
Man dying, yellow tape for the cursion
Put your life off on auction
Fuck what it cost, for an offering
Tell your mommy fuck a brand new house
Tell your mommy going and get her brand new coffin
