[Hook]
They say them boys turned crazy after Shyste died
Look around bitch, it’s shyste time
But shyste ain’t dead, he just went to Vegas
With his .45 and a couple Haitians
Bitch you ain’t ‘bout that life, so why you keep on faking
Don’t make King County have another patient
Harlem Zoes I brought with me, bitch them niggas Haitians
No green card don’t call immigration

[Verse 1]
I’m on the road to the money, bitch I keep 'em chasing
No conversation with these bitches, see these bitches later
I’m racing to the shmoney that’s my destination
Lajan lo, I let Bob translate
Black on black Audi thats my transportation
Bitch act like I’m fronting bitch no hesitation
No one-on-one with the squad, ho, no isolation
I’ll have you on the doctor table getting operations
Oh yeah my highs with the shits, that’s cooperation
And we don’t tell the cops shit, no corroboration (not at all)
Oh yeah it's shmoney on my mind, that’s my occupation
Oh yeah my Shmurda in this bitch that’s why them guns was sprayin'
Oh you ain’t heard, you ain’t heard I get that shmoney bitch
I bust that shmoney dance now she on a shmoney dick
Oh you ain’t heard, you ain’t heard I get that shmoney bitch
Oh you ain’t heard, you ain’t heard she on that shmoney dick
Got a pocket full of shmoney like a pocketful
I got a pocketful of crippies  that’ll pop it to you
I got a pocketful for a nigga, got a pocketful
And they buy out the bar when they want to

[Verse 2]
Its Kokane time when I’m in the field
With my shooters bitch it’s game time
See a fuck nigga, open fire, I don’t aim mine (why not)
Let that thing fly, we hitting niggas with the same nine
Who let a word fly, all my niggas do the same time
I hit that ass with the same nine
When Jordan went and hit that hang time
And Monte went and he just banged five
Cueno caught a fuck boy and he slang nine
Even Sha Sha gave it up, I heard he slang fire
Larry Bird that’s that shooter, he get face time
All my niggas in the field, bitch the gang nine
We making 'Kane smile
