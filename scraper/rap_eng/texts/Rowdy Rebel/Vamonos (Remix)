[Hook: YT Triz]
Pull up and drop a nigga like a domino, v치monos
I'mma tell a nigga bye like adios, v치monos
Why you talkin' on the phone, bitch?
Ain't no talkin' on the phone, bitch
Ain't no talkin' on the phone, bitch
Ain't no talkin' on the phone, bitch
Pull up and drop a nigga like a domino, v치monos
I'ma tell a nigga bye like adios, v치monos

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Riding baby
The hood near me
Go crazy for pussy, they tryna play me
So I ride on them niggas til 380's
And I even put a shot in they [?]
Then its M.I.A til it Lil Haiti
Not my 16's by Mercedes
And my 16's still kill babies
Nigga ain't no talking on the phone
We slide on em niggas til they homes
Shawty calm to they dome
Adios, [?]
Drop a nigga like some dominoes
Swimming on a table like a volleyball
Hang up a nigga like a dial tone
Now everybody screaming who like I'm Mike Jones
Man I wish a nigga would, on my Pac shit
Or he gon' get shot when the Glock kick
Take the mother of the moth spit
Then your block on my eyes on some hot shit
In the 9 where you find me though
So when the body drop, nobody know
So when you in yo funeral
I'm in the studio, tell em boy adios
