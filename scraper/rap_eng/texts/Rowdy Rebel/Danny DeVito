[Chorus: Desiigner]
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
I said my pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
D-Danny Devito
If you getting money, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The fifties and hundreds, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The bitches they love you, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
So fuck all the haters, the block is on Danny Devito, Danny Devito

[Verse 1: PHresher]
Pockets on Danny Devito
Feelin’ like Papi when he sell a kilo
Jordan when he hit the jumper on Ehlo
I do my thing, might kick out on a Lilo, Stitch
Snitches get stitches for real
If you knew better you’d keep your mouth sealed
Bitch give me face while I’m steering the wheel
Wait ‘til she find out I ain’t got a deal, oh no
That beat goes on but I ain’t Sonny Bono
Sexting each other like I’m making a porno
Girl in the place and I feel like I’m Romo
Pretty [?] bitches be giving me coño
Look to her left, she was sucking a dude
Stepped in the [?] looking impeccable
Phenomenal far from regular dude
Time money, don’t got a second to lose
I bet you wish you was me, wooh
I bet you wish you was me, you
Just let me be, what could it be
Cause you fallin’ off significantly
Keep it [?] while whipping the V
Love me or hate me, no difference to me
That shit why [?] she listen to me
Suck me or fuck me, no difference to me
Goddamn, as long I come bitch
How you get it [?] dick and bubblegum bitch
Shawty said it ain’t tricking if you got it
You’re damn right, but I ain’t the one bitch
On to the next nigga, ‘cause I’m on to the next bitch
I’m the wrong one to mess with
Drop bands on a necklace
Cause I’m young, restless, and reckless

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
I said my pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
D-Danny Devito
If you getting money, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The fifties and hundreds, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The bitches they love you, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
So fuck all the haters, the block is on Danny Devito, Danny Devito

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
Bitch I got hundreds on hundreds, like I own the casino
Bitch my pockets so fat, they Danny Devito
Call up my boy Quentin, they on Carlos Santana
And I might get a kilo, just to put on his neck if he catch a [?]
Bitch I’m dirty my reefer
Just dirty my Sprite, yeah my two liter
If she saucy I eat her
Sike I’m just lying, that’s a [?]
I just roll up this Keisha
Pop a new ride, kick it with Keisha
Bitch I’m riding a teacher
All them hating ass niggas, I made them believers
It’s the takeover ether
This the crack that Bobby was selling to Rita
Now it’s taking your feature
Send me the money, I go fuck your beat up
Nobody can beat us
Ballin’ on niggas, go tell ‘em to D up
I run like a cheetah
Choppin’ the [?] on the blunt of your beater

[Chorus: Desiigner]
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
I said my pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny, pockets on Danny
Pockets on Danny Devito
Pockets on Danny Devito
D-Danny Devito
If you getting money, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The fifties and hundreds, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
The bitches they love you, your pockets on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
So fuck all the haters, the block is on Danny Devito, Danny Devito
