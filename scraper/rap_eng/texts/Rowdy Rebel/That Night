[Verse 1]
When I was young a nigga couldn't sleep at night
I used to hear them shots go off beat night
I lost Kaine i couldn't believe that night
Strapped up a nigga ran into police that night
In the precinct man I couldn't sleep that night
Me and Bobby we was on beam that night
And I was rolling barely couldn't breathe that night
I even seen Johnny P and Two G that night
As time past I boy tote my heat all night
Cause if it go down at any time i can't sleep at night
Lost the homie french why you had to speed that night
I lost my nigga Jah why didn't you leave that night
I was right at the crib and try to get that key that night
I tried to strap up and load that .16 that night
I even lost my nigga Boom didn't see that night
But know my nigga Boom went out like G that night

[Chorus]x2
If i could lend you my eyes could you see my life
If i could lend you my kicks could you walk in my nikes
If my boy was alive would you roll with shyste
I got a story to tell about what happen that night

[Verse 2]
Oh that night shit was crazy
Rowdy baby
Strapped up with .380's
Going crazy
But that nigga ran into them cops
And Oh boy was next up
But I been Oh boy like NO boy
Knowing everything
Spankings
Throwing up my gang what you Thankin'
Patient wanting for that bill this Vacation
Next week I was out hitting them train stations
Thinking of Call of Duty no PlayStation
Had to that that block with a Glock
I was racing
Pacing back and fourth
Didn't see no faces
Waiting just to put a pussy on the pavement
Fuck Cocaine, I go all in
Like how Jordan treats spodin
We live or die for the 9
Not the [...]
Put the clip in that 45 and go right

[Chorus]x2
If i could lend you my eyes could you see my life
If i could lend you my kicks could you walk in my nikes
If my boy was alive would you roll with shyste
I got a story to tell about what happen that night
