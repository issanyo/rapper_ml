[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
2014 Nigga my life done changed
Look at my city nigga, that shit on flames
Big up to Brooklyn nigga like shotta days
But everyday I'm with my hatiens, sapase
Used to ride on them niggas block everyday
Tryna go rock, niggas tryna rock me
But how you gon' stop a nigga that ain't like me?
We still in cocky, get it with the posse
Calmly, shitting with the army
Tryna get in touch with my mommy
Just to see her sons living properly
I tell her, "me and Fetti good", thanks to Poplottie
No more bandos or public lobbies
It's big house, big couch with a balcony
And I bet them hating niggas still doubting me
Shout out to Meek Milly, real OGs always look out for me

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
Do you see my vision?
To the top we go, to the top of the ceiling
What about them buildings
No heat, no water, no toilet to shit in
So now when I get it, with me and my brother
Nigga we shitting
Kemar got a prison
Build pops a home, just to go chill in
What about my living?
Everyday with a Glock 'cause them niggas was killing
But I was commited
To all of my niggas so yeah I was with it
I was strapped with a glizzy
I mean strapped with a glizzy, looking for niggas
If I see him, I swish 'em
I'll let Cueno go get em 'cause Cueno so with it
If he move, we blitz it
He 'gon end up missing
My niggas so different
Better mind your business
Don't start no shit, if you ain't 'gon finish
Bet it hurt your feelings
'Cause the day you lack, my niggas is killing
When I get that million
Take care of the killers, the hood and the children

[Bridge: Rowdy Rebel]
I do this shit for the ghetto nigga
For my block, for my hood, for my gang, for my niggas, for all my fallen soldiers
RIP all my felons, free the felons
I do it for the real
GS9, we too 9
Ain't no chill button
I come from the 9 hoe

[Verse 3: Don Q]
I'm the crack when the coke cook
I'm the dope that the boat pushed
Google me nigga, just go look
Who are these niggas? They so shooked
I got a bag, I pile up the stash of hundreds
That shit about 4 foot
Nigga that's a C-note book
My chain hot, Kilo look
Just say a prayer if you care for me
'Cause I remember who was there for me
I'm famous so I move carefully
I'm taking drugs for the therapy
It's only one
It's not a pair in me
I don't know why they comparing me
I am the one
Look how they staring me
Wishing that they can get near to me
I keep a gun
It ain't no fear in me
Nigga this must be a parody
My chain is a ton
All of this clarity
Raising my funds like a charity
My dog on the run
It is not fair to me
He said them folks tryna bury me
He just had a son but apparently
We never speak on the phone cause they hearing me
It's clear to me
That I'm the nigga that the streets praise
Catch a charge then I leave state
I got killers waiting on release dates
Put in work nigga each day
And it's overnight
I don't sleep late
I'm in the alley with the free base
For the niggas tryna get they weed laced
Philipp√© plates when I eat steak
Remember I couldn't afford it
The rent due and we couldn't ignore it
Furniture put in the storage
I throw your bitch in the whip and I floor it
Shades? I Christian Dior it
She was just under my pics and he saw it
Then he went tryna report it
Gotta watch who you trust nigga
Nowadays it'll be the close ones
Shit changed when the folks come
They gone tell em all about your coke run
Pay attention, gotta see the signs
Gotta read in between the lines
Certain things you gotta keep in mind
Real nigga, free the 9

[Interlude: Don Q]
Yeah, came in from nothing nigga
I know how it feel to take loses
Put your niggas in position to make bosses
I took over the streets single-handedly nigga
You gotta respect that
I put my hood on my back first nigga
Yeah, free GS9 nigga
Free all my niggas locked down
I ain't forget about none of y'all, gang
