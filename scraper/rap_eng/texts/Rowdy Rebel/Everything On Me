[Hook: Abillyon]
She gon' cry for a nigga
Know a nigga keep it by his side for his niggas
She gon' die for a nigga
Early mornings I’m gone

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas
[Early mornings I’m gone x4]

Shmoney, Shmoney. . . Rowdy Baby

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
I came up from the hard knocks
Thats why I took the drop top, off the car lot
Early morning going all out
On the road to the Shmoney till a lil' nigga fall out
And thats why they hate me
But they could never break me
Two pennies they could never change me
I'm Rowdy, I'm Rowdy, I'm Rowdy baby
The same niggas from the start
They wanna put the pain in your heart
They wanna make your heart turn cold
Turn around and put the flame in your heart
She heard about me getting busy on the road
I got a feeling she gon' take me out
I heard this girl real crazy on the low
But thank God I made it out

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas
[Early mornings I’m gone x4]

ZOE GOD

[Verse 2: Corey Finesse]
Everything is on me
Gotta keep doing my thing
Everything is on me
I got people dependent on me
Everyday on the road
Daughter need new clothes
Mommy need new home
Cueno need new tones
We don’t know how to act
All we wanna do is ball
Smoke weed with my dogs
Shit fuck with a nigga thoughts
And I lock that shit
Then when I come around niggas like Corey got that shit
Don’t stop that shit
Girl pop that shit
Hold it down for a nigga
Still stay around when its cold like winter
Ride for a nigga, she’ll die for a nigga ‘cause

Everything’s on me

[Chorus: Abillyon]
Cry for a nigga
She gon' die for a nigga
Fire in the hammer always ride for a nigga
She don’t wanna leave me cuz she down for my niggas
With the homies so we know that ima ride for my niggas
[Everything’s on me x4]
High with my niggas
I get high with my niggas
Any nigga touch me ima die for my niggas
Know you niggas know the hammer fly for my niggas
Rolling with the 12.45 for my niggas
[Early mornings I’m gone x4]

Early mornings I’m gone
Early mornings I’m gone
