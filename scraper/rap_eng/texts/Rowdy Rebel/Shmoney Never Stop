[Hook: Quavo]
Benjamin hundreds cash out
Shmigo money never stop
Walk around with extendos and Glocks
Fuck with Shmigo gang nigga get popped
Shmigo money never stop, Shmigo money never stop
Shmigo money never stop, Shmigo money never stop
Hundreds of knots, walk in the bank and cash out
Shmigo money never stop, Shmigo money never stop
Shmigo money never stop, Shmigo money never gang
Walk around with extendos and Glocks
Cash cash coming nigga now stop

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Shmigo gang from New York to the A and we got plugs in LA
Walking around with blue hundos young nigga I don't give a fuck what you say
Breaking in we want the safe, Bobby got the choppa to his face
Shmigo gang fuck nigga spray the whole squad like a can of mace
Getting brain in the X6 I haven't seen the nasty bitch since
Call me young Quavo Obama I got secret service with president tints
Pinky ring pay your rent
There go twelve jump the fence
If a nigga say he got the whole thing tell the squad send a blitz

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset & (Rowdy Rebel)]
Money coming like a train
Diamonds moonwalking Michael Jackson chain
(Diamonds honey glazed you can see the diamonds dancing in the shade)
Taking shots like the paparazzi, hundred million dollars no Illuminati
(So don't be afraid pull up Maserati put a shotty to his body)
Coco-Cola, baking soda, remix the dummy brick makeover
(Shmigo gang take over we pull up in Raris no Range Rover)
Safari Balenciaga make her [?], dunking the brick Amar'e Stoudemire
(Shmurda Migo gang empire), leave a nigga smelling sweet and sour

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takoff & (Bobby Shmurda)]
Thirty round clip on my hip so you know its about to be a murder
Hit a nigga with the hundred round drum make him crank the Bobby Shmurda
(Flipping niggas like burgers, hitting up town switching up burners
These niggas they nervous, if it ain't bout Shmoney then it don't concern us )
Pull in a Maybach in the president a nigga riding with the curtains
Red dot on your head pop the cherry pussy nigga was a virgin
(Pussy nigga ain't learn, of that burst spit
So surprised when they heard hit yellow tape the block when I curve it)
Yellow taped the block when they curved it
I'm in my Lamborghini swerving
Offset bought the Porsche and put it on forgis
Cartiers on my face lookin' like Morpheus
(Pablo Picasso paint a portrait that bitch nice but my bitch gorgeous
I got hundreds they enormous, youngin on that corner)
