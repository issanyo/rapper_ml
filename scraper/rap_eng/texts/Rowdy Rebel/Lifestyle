[Intro: Rowdy Rebel]
(Girl he got Schmoney)
I ain't got shit through this player nigga
All about nothing nigga, am just a productful, checkmate

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
Gang, If you live by that gun, you die by that gun
Ride where am from, get that money, never hide where I'm from
Break bread with my niggas, every pie every crumb
Passport pics, just the sound of that click you the slums
Man am tired of that lifestyle, everyday is a kind of retire
Man look at that boy lifestyle, how those bitches high and out
Thinking cause they know me before, that they go get this pie now
Tell them bitches pipe now, quit it
Fuck them bitches,was when a nigga had no chicken
Fuck that down ass chick that was so witty, got admit it
Am like a real nigga, boy you know I stuck with it
So I take care of home base
Got my new car and it's parked outside of my own place
Everybody too stress, new lawyer for my new case
Am just tyrna live, truth says

[Hook: RockyRich]
All bitches high now, few holes on me right now
But I be tell these bitches pipe down
Is it cause of my style, or they just love a nigga lifestyle
Yeah they just love a nigga lifestyle
All bitches high now,few holes on me right now
But I just tell these bitches pipe down
Cause they just love a nigga lifestyle
Only in it for the moment, they just want a nigga right now

[Verse 2: RockyRich]
Yeah, want some hood burgers with some cheese dough
With seasons and scallions
Best dresser nigga, you can throw me on a salad
That's why these rules don't just top on my dick
These bitches gallop, so when am done I'll be on another one like am Kalid
Cause these sunny days bitches never around when it's cloudy
Mad like R.A Ratter round town in Audi
She heard about vacays, how it went down in Saudi
Or maybe heard the song I laid down Aburabi
She's from Florida or somewhere in Boca
Skin complexion mocha, she beg for me to choke her every time that I stroke her
Money like a Broker, her my chips like it's Poker
Or maybe Cause she heard I made a hundred thousand off a Joker
Everybody sly now, shopping sprees and splurging
Givenchy, Coast to Shearling, Chanel back to Burkin
I ride the bus, she curving, A.M.G coupe the swerving
Flirting, open up for certain, glove on like am a Surgeon

[Hook: RockyRich]
All bitches high now, few holes on me right now
But I be tell these bitches pipe down
Is it cause of my style, or they just love a nigga lifestyle
Yeah they just love a nigga lifestyle
All bitches high now, few holes on me right now
But I just tell these bitches pipe down
Cause they just love a nigga lifestyle
Only in it for the moment, they just want a nigga right now
