[Intro]
Rowdy baby, squad
Nigga my block hot, nigga, my block burn
Nigga my block on fire, nigga, what about yours?

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning, bitch, the birds chirpin'
Narc's on my block, yeah, them boys lurkin'
Just keep your head up lil' nigga, don't be lookin' nervous
And don't panic if they run up and they try to search ya'
You feel a flame fucking with the gang, chick-a-bang
I put ya' brains on ya picture frame
And everybody on my block know I up them thangs
But nobody on my block gonna up and sing, pussy
There's rules on my block, a few done tried and a few done got shot
So don't get it confused on my block
Gettin' rude or try to be cute on my block
Like, early in the morning, go and check my blood
Oh my nigga Boss man got that work strapped up
I tell my nigga all the fuckin' time like bro, you the next best chef up
My youngins in the kitchen, they be water whippin'
Short a gram, you can find ya' daughter missin'
Picture orderin' just don't get ya order different
He wasn't swimming the sharks because I caught him fishin'
My hot boys tote Glocks, boy
And they don't just tote, yeah, they shot boys
Body twirl, watch him drop boy
Oh, I ain't tell you them niggas was hot boys?

[Hook] x2
Nigga, my block on fire, nigga, what about yours?
My hot boys rollin' and them boys don't care
Catch a fuck nigga slippin', run up on then wait
They don't want me, Allen or D-Wade

[Verse 2]
Nigga, welcome to my Zoe life, should I live a cold life?
IPhone box wrapped up, nigga, with all rice
I done seen shit that make a nigga live the wrong life
Good die young but ain't nothing bout' them boys nice
I done seen sons sell a gun for the right price
In the long run, the same gun take that boy life
We had a hard life, fought for hard white
But niggas charge it to the game, credit card swipes
Fresh mikes, probably do the all whites
Giuseppe down when I get the cash right
And I ain't fucking all these bitches from my past life
Unless the register is lit or I'm cash right
And I be waiting for the cash, waiting all night
Once the shit clear, I be there, on sight
Heard these lame niggas moving funny
Just don't jack squad, nigga, all Shmoneys

[Hook] x2
