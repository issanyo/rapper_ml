[Hook: Rowdy Rebel][x2]
Bitch that Shmoney keep on calling, bitch I got to go
Adios, bitch I’m gone, next stop Mexico
Touchdown on that work, bitch I’m Plaxico
Touchdown on that work, bitch I’m Plaxico

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
I’m in Cali smoking Cali kush on that boat
At LA, call up Chi Money, tell him bring that smoke
Call that nigga Rob Dank, I need Cali smoke
I need that Cali, aw shit I’ll probably cop an O
Head back to Mexico, with two sexy hoes
Touchdown on that work, bitch I’m Plaxico
This a no flex zone, bitch we vagabonds
My [?] castle’s [?], bitch it’s Gaga show
Don’t matter where we go, we tuck that 44
Tuck that beam jawn, drop that body-o
I’m in Mexico, flexing with bros
Finessing foreign hoes, once that Shmoney gone

Bitch that Shmoney keep on calling, bitch I got to go

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]

Computers is [?], niggas is shooting them rugers, clueless
Better Stacey Dash when I chase your ass cause I’m flexing, Lex Luger
My pockets is fat, buddha

Little nigga from my hood that ain’t up to no good
