On your your block with a semi
Cueno, give that boy a figi

RIP my lil bro Speedy
Give us the shmoney, boy we greedy
Or we gon' keep killing for Speedy
Cause we kill for the squad if it's necessary
So this lil boy gon' get his figi shot
Now start hangin' in a cemetery
I post up with the squad on the fifty Glock

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
These bitches shut up
Bank bank crazy, get them wad up
Tell a nigga catch up, no let up on his ass with riders
Choppers and MACs with lasers
RIP Nuskey, free Nine, and bitch I pull a caper
Finger fuck the nina, I rape her
Smoke opps out a swisher sweet
Headshot if you think I'm sweet
10K, you dead in a week
Put one in your head, you sleep-in'
And bitch I feel like cops and robbers
You try one of my niggas and get caught like lobsters
I just spent a band on Robins
All black like Batman but ain't no Robin

[Hook: Rowdy Rebel]
For Kokane, we still get trippy
Cause for Kokane, we still get busy
But RIP my lil bro Speedy
Tomorrow night we giving figis
Cause for Kokane, we still get trippy
And for Kokane, we still get busy
But RIP my lil bro Speedy
Tomorrow night we giving figis
Tomorrow night we giving figis
Tomorrow night we giving figis

[Verse 3: Rowdy Rebel]
I done lost too many guys, I lost plenty
Get some Henny, load them things
Tell 'em that you're busy, now your boys gon' run 'em down
From a youngin we tote Glizzys
We them boys out in our city
Shooting Glocks 'til it's empty so don't even fuck around
Tell the pussy if he tempt me
I design 'em like a Fendi
Slide up on him real gently
Figi shot, I spin around
Cause it's G.U.N. 'til the end nigga
So tell a friend, tell a friend nigga
