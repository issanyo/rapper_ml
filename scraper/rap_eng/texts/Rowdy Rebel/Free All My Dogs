[Hook][x2]
Free all of my dogs, dope dealers
They serving that raw, them coke dealers
Thats killing all of them boys, free all my killers
Free all of my squad, I love all my niggas

[Verse 1]
Roll that roll that beam joint put that on his beam joint
You can put my team on for some cash and lean on
Grab some space to peeon no more smoking ping pong
Free slice billy top dog , you know we some hot boys
But for my family I focuse on that main thang
And for my family I even stopped that gangbang
And for my family I even put away some change
But on my family Rowdy you'll never change
I came a long way so fuck what they say
Copped me a [?] im riding to the bank
Spend it a hunnid cop me a plate
[?]

Free all of my dogs, dope dealers
They serving that raw, them coke dealers
Thats killing all of them boys, free all my killers
Free all of my squad, I love all my niggas
