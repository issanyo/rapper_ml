[Hook: Manolo Rose]
It’s two dope boys on the avenue
Hopping out the G ride, chain glisten
Mink dragon on the floor, not to mention
The bitches they love us, they want to fuck us
The bitches they love us, they want to fuck us

[Verse 1: Rowdy Rebel]
It's two dope boys on a mission
Hopping out the G ride, chain glisten
And these bitches they love us, they want to fuck us
GS9 all my niggas, man they my brothers
I remember late night in them trenches
On the corner ducking deals, jumping fences
Class clown, man I stayed up in detention
So when I ride by, keep the top missing
Man you never seen nothing like this
Scratch that, I’m past that, look at my wrist
And free my nigga 730 K Tone
Get busy with the Glocks, I get busy on my block boy
It’s all about the man, not to mention
I keep a dirty .80 round me, no extension
All eyes on me, feel their attention
Hopping out the G Ride, chain glisten

[Verse 2: Manolo Rose]
Me and my crew be on a mission
Remember when I didn’t have a pot to piss in
The nina, that’s my bitch, I be tricking
So you know I had to pay for extensions
When the finger hit the trigger call it kissing
Extra clips in my pocket made it last longer
I learned from the 9, oh yeah
Cameras watching when I’m shooting, keep your mask on
Splash brothers with the aim, fuck that
I’m past that, yeah nigga, Manolo wrote it
Young bosses in the game, oh yeah
I want my nigga [?] told him how to get it gone
