Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Verse 1: Bobby Shmurda]
Let me tell you I'm conceited, bitch, I don't need a bitch
They be begging me to breed a bitch, but I can't keep a bitch
You know me, right after I beat it bitch, Imma leave it, bitch
I ain't even with the screaming shit, Imma freeze a bitch
Then ask Monte where my sneakers went, with the Beamer whip
Shooting niggas front of Keisha crib, right where Keisha live
Homie, tell me if you need a shift, I'm at Rita crib
CC2's like every weekend, bitch, ain't no sleeping this
Let me tell you 'bout my reckless life
I was selling white, homies 'bout to cause some wreck tonight
Ain't no check tonight, police looking for us left to right
Ain't no rest tonight, we on the run until the check is right
You get the message, aight?

[Hook: Rowdy Rebel]
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life
Now what you know about that kitchen life
When we was pitching white?
People saying that our vision right, but we ain't living right
I told Bobby keep that pistol tight the way we living life
Niggas turn into that jealous type when you start living life

Ah, uh

[Verse 2: Rowdy Rebel]
I'm living life like a boss
Bitch, take a photo and get busy with a star
I'm living large so don't know the total to my car
But I just know that shit real fast when it start
Shit, watch me take off, I'm a fool, I'm a dog
I'm a nigga that make music for a job
I'll drop a bomb on your beat but it costs
Nigga, what you thought? Bitch, I'm Rowdy, I go hard
With 30 bands then I blow it on the squad
Give a little bit of shmoney to my moms
Remember when that nigga used to jugg and rob?
Now we living large
