[Spit Gemz]
Gemstar General, Lo Life assassin
Cell block scholar, the Professor and the mad man
You're now facing the face lifter
That tattoo on your face just gives me something easier to trace nigga
Career bitter, still smell like the yard
Play hard, I play your card son, I know what you are
You a big for nothin' King Kong rockin' a pink thong
Fly swatter, slap your face if you blink wrong
My team strong, Double L's, Lyrically Legendary
We still son suckers for ITs when necessary
You was John Doe, rode a couple horses
Now you John Lo, perpetratin', taintin' the God's flow
Ho, do the history, this is authenticity
Don't let your ignorance be the catalyst of your misery
So what it is Brother Lo, let me know where they at
Put me on, I'll bring it to 'em, that's a go

[Hook: Spit Gemz]
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
I was raised in a broken home
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Being real is all I know
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
For my Double L's I'ma let it go
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Just wait until I get off parole

[Sadat X]
First off you should know
USPA is not Lo
If you holdin' that down then you're fuckin' up the flow
Every time you see me at a show, see the horse
We're married for life, fuck gettin' a divorce
Whether purchased, snatched, credit or fraud
Bring me the card nigga I got the broads
Extra bait and I'm taking it there, I'll catch a case
Open up your face with a vase, you're a rookie
Box Lo tatted my cookie in the East
Walk with a new piece, a fleece
Now everybody wanna live the life
But you never went through the pain and the strife
Fuck the police and mall security
Getting shit past the hood was an insurance you see
Trading coats like, like it was currency

[Hook: Sadat X]

I'll take cash, no checks
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
See the whole world through my specs
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Lo Life, who's up next?

[Thirstin Howl III]
I took my Double L's all across the globe
Became a legend in jail with my Polo robe
Born leader from porn star to preacher
Felony pedigree, pork chops and pizza
Child walking, pound for pound portions
My resume levitates, a nigga now corporate
Flame spitter, to Twitter, tank spitter
Clorox drops mixed with paint thinner
Polo branded established in MGV
Willing to die in the war, fuck it let me bleed
Gucci skin tats and we Cross Flag
Polo flip flops and a big straw hat
I'm Big Vic Lo anywhere I go
Love and Loyalty always been my code
Miami Fam and the Ayak brand
Original Founders and the Outdoorsmen

[Hook: Thirstin Howl III]
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
From the Garvey right on Bristol
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Thirsty, Thirsty, Big Vic Lo
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
I claim the crown and I claim the throne
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Ralph Lauren and them, they already know

[Meyhem Lauren]
Welcome to the great outdoors, we break laws
And never wore condoms when we used to rape stores
Hit Sach's from the back
Macy's got touched missionary
I got a piece for every verb in the dictionary
Blow up crowd, a P-Wing for every noun
My Lo-Wife is draped in a silk Lo gown
Always extra, emphasize extraordinary
Fly shit, my steeze with ITs was never ordinary
Been doin' this since way back, black, for reala
Polo Bear on my chest but I'm a fucking Lo gorilla
Gators on my feet, got suede on me too
When I come through my self it's like welcome to the zoo
I rep for Q-U, BK's my second home
Sportsman hat with the big bill covers my dome
Classics and new items all get flipped
It's a fact from wayback to right now, I stay dipped

[Hook: Meyhem Lauren]
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Know my steeze dog, I shine, I glow
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Niggas can't rap, you can't fuck with my flow
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Sex, drugs, money and shit, you know the deal
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
I don't give a shit or a fuck how you feel

[Fi-Lo]
I'm a Lo Life General, I'm not changing my L's for nobody
Put me on a beat with the best emcees and watch me catch a body
I'm original, I could never be a copy
Now it's time for me to spit acid rhymes
If you didn't understand my flow the first time then you wasn't using your mind
You wasn't using your imagination
I'm a black Cuban but I spit voodoo like Haitians
I'm a rudebwoy like Jamaicans
My icepicks will send you to hell
Tell Lucifer I don't sign deals with the Devil
I'm the son of God, in my lifetime I never got robbed
You know where to find me, with a bottle of ? drinking at the bar [2x]

[Hook: Fi-Lo]
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
I was born with a Fila sole
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
And you know that I'm outta control
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Lo Life, money, hoes and clothes
(What it is Brother Lo!) [2x]
Lo Life, money, hoes and clothes
