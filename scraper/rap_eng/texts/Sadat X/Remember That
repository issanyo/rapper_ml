[Intro]
Yeeah! It’s been a journey man
This is some feel good right here, I, I remember a lotta shit!
Yeah! Thinkin’ back yo, you done a lotta things you gotta remember though!
You gotta remember… I remember
Understand!

[Verse 1]
I done had many cars, many bars
Remember the first whip you grinded for? Stack!
Went to the dollars with a fistful of dollars
Knowing nuthin’ about the paperwork… Bring the car jerk!
I’m going to the carwash and the club, and I'mma bounce with summin’
Remember the first time? The first rhyme that made niggas say, “Son! You got summin’!”
Remember planning the day out, the whole layout
Precision every hour, taking that shower?
Clothes already laid out!
Remember that first time you stayed at a honey crib?
And came home with the sun…
Remember that son?
Remember break night, Remember break white?
Remember you sold in front of the police like it was nuff, remember that?
In December that year, remember when you failed to appear to the court?

[Hook]
Do you remember!?
When we used to play shoot ’em up, Bang-Bang?
Shoot ‘em up, BANG-BANG!
You remember!?
When we used to play shoot ‘em up, Bang-Bang?
Shoot ‘em up, BANG-BAANG!

[Verse 2]
Do you remember when the used to have house parties?
And you’d find that girl that was the most in your world?
And for them fine slow jams, y’all got it in!
Remember your first chain?
You’d go out when the store closed
I’ma kill these hoes!
Remember boosting clothes?
So you was fly on Easter
Playing the goose
Remember when son died? How we all cried
And for his daughter we provide
Remember Rikers Island on the inside?
Remember the boat parties we wouldn’t let in?
You swore you was winning
Went home spinning
Remember Flex first dropped the bomb?
Summin’ nice on your arm?
You didn’t wear the glove, so you made baby love
Remember that!?

[Hook]
