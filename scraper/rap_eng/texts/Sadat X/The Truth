[Intro: Sadat X]
Yeah Dot X the Wild Cowboy
Here with my main man the Beat Bop Scholar
Holla y'all
Understand where going with it
You know, let's go, check it out

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
The Superbowl champs live here (Giants)
The city goes live this year (you know it)
I'm from the apple with the statue in the water
It don't count if you living on the border (that don't count)
Let's blow a quart and get right into this groove
Look like New York's back to be in the mood, holla
I'm with Scholar, and our goal is to teach
But if you come into this reach
You gonna learn this jewels
From Brand Nubian yo I got the tools for civilization
The Five Percent who know the truth (Peace)
But I still take header on the roof
And get bread up in the booth daily
Check it out I'm the cowboy, got the style, right now boy
Shining just reminding all of y'all
I started in the hall
And banging on the wall
20 years later still a raider

[Hook: Sadat X]
The Cowboy and the Beat Bop Scholar
Make a little dollar
So we can keep going
Scholar made the beat and I'mma keep on flowing
Let the lames keep hoeing they playing themselves
Right about now you gonna see us on the shelves
The Cowboy and the Beat Bop Scholar
Trynna get dollar
So we can keep going
Scholar made the beat and I'mma keep on flowing
Let the lames keep hoeing they playing themselves
Right about now you gonna see us on the shelves

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
Ok the Beat Bop Scholar grabbed X by the collar
I came for my friend cause we stand as men
The beat is done up with the western blend
Me I still write with my pen
The Blackberry please
I made to the rap freeze
I took the bird overseas and came back
They playing the same five joints
You don't get the same points
For piggy backing, hacking
Cover's what you lacking
Make my fish black and the goes
The Beat Bop Scholar make 'em all follow
The world can't swallow
We should be kings
Give us property, fuck chains and rings
I'm first person
To fuckings to no cursins
Award-winning stunning
16 bars keep the car running
When I was young double gunning
I was wilding
Then I seen the city from the Island
Racial profiling caused the god to be swift
I will smoke a little something but I will not snift
I can't fuck up this gift

[Hook: Sadat X]
The Cowboy and the Beat Bop Scholar
Make a little dollar
So we can keep going
Scholar made the beat and I'mma keep on flowing
Let the lames keep hoeing they playing themselves
Right about now you gonna see us on the shelves
The Cowboy and the Beat Bop Scholar
Trynna get dollar
So we can keep going
Scholar made the beat and I'mma keep on flowing
Let the lames keep hoeing they playing themselves
Right about now you gonna see us on the shelves
