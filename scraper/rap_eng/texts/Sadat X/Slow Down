Slow down (repeat 3X)

[Sadat X]
Hey baby your hips was getting big
Now you're getting thin you don't care about your wig
Now Woolie Willie got a pair of my sneakers
Wonder where he got 'em cause I hid 'em behind my speakers
The object of your affection is the tree-top connection
Where basically you love to smoke your wools
The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door
I don't smoke jums so what they knocking for
Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you
Street time is limited to days
On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back
Damn it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials
With a wide-eyed look and a rotten-toothed smile
Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger
From one spot on to the next spot on to the next spot on to the next
Stunt get a job, from me you won't rob
Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand
Now give that to the crack man
You was fly once now you're losing all your fronts
Started off light only tipping woolie blunts
But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe
Took a long pull...hype
Yeah, head crack head crack
You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back
(Hey yo X, wasn't that your girl?)
Yeah I had to drop her
Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her

[Edie Brickell]
Slow down
What I am is what I am

[Lord Jamar]
I knew this girl named Tropicana
She's always juicing
Producing cash from her sexual tasks
She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat
You ain't paid then your grade is incomplete
You've got to flash dollars, to prove her
And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover
Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes
Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive
(What I am is what I am)
Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt
And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram
I've seen your kind before you're not original
Just a sick mixed up individual
Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch
Marking off the goods you get going up another notch
Your ways and actions are like those of a savage
If the price is right, then anyone can ravage
Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order


Slow down x7
What I am is what I am x2

[Grand Puba]
As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt
A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants
But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic
And if you swing an ep you'd better wear a prophylactic
Cause things are getting drastic
Slide up in the wrong one you'll end up in a casket
(Slow down)
Sister, there's no need in speeding
She was doing lays before she started meeting
What makes a stunt want to act in this fashion?
Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson
A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner
Lay the Bed over there and then you run right in her
Puba makes no mistakes
She said, "Rock me tonight (for old time's sake)"
Picture that
(Slow Down)
You little hooker
Honey got a problem with the bends
Meaning she likes to bend over, and then she spreads the skins
The Door is just Open and that's without no controversy
She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy
Come on toots you can take a thousand douche
You Been Making Up a Scoop And 40 Dueces Troop
Honey’s Being Foul Or About Catch A Foul
But You Don’t Know Sucker It’s Just Where It’s All About
Scrub that It’s Just Have A Thinker
I Wanna Know Is Put Ring On Your Finger
(Slow down)
You're living foul
(Slow down)
You’re Ain’t No Style
Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing
Cause it's not the season
So if you want to live foul and be a dumb diddy dumb dumb bitch
Well go ahead, Baby

I'd like to give a special shout to my DJ Alamo on the help out
Right by my side

Slow down (repeat 12X)
