Verse One: Lord Jamar

7 in the mornin, they kickin down my momma's door
Now tell me what is this motherfuckin drama for?
Can a nigga get rest after rest without the stress?
Then they put the Glock to my chest
Best think 'fore I twitch or I'm popped
Off to the clink with this bitch ass cop
They gotta nigga locked like the dread on my head, jack
And if I try to fight back, well then I'm dead, black
I got the right to an attorney and to stay silent
They got the right to try to burn me if I play violent
I know the game so I just roll with the procedure
Illegal search and seizure, somethin that they're doin at their leisure
Down at the station, interrogation is takin place
Overcrowded jails but for me they're makin space
Tell the devil to his face he can suck my dick
It's the whole black race that they're fuckin with
Come to find my crime was lettin brothers know the time
Only the devil is stoppin me from eatin swine
And plus my prior record sealed my fate
One For All and In God We Trust got me sent upstate
But still I won't bite my tongue
I just write tight shit to incite the young, to fight the one
Who keeps them on a level that's minimum
That's the number one reason

Chorus: (sample of Luther Ingram's "I'm Tryin To Sing A Message To You")

(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat*

Verse Two: Sadat X

I was frustrated, I can't do no more push-ups
Niggas be swole up, locked down cos of a hold-up
"The devil made me do it" is what I say
Got some bad news on my one phone call the other day
"I love the kids and I teach em to love their father
I'll get you some kicks and try to send some flicks
But it's over, baby, yes it's over"
Ain't much you can do when you're holdin a phone
A million inmates but ya still alone
You're not cryin but inside ya dyin
You might cry in the night when ya safe and outta sight
Damn I miss my peeps and the rides in the jeeps
And my, casual freedom, where's my crew when I need em?
A visit ain't the same like being in the game
But I'll take it, at least with that I'll make it
The beast is a bitch and I see it
I do the knowledge to em, so next time I can do em
"Yo X, I got ta lock it now but write me real soon
I know that you're a busy man, give me a minute"
You can never know the penal til you been locked the fuck up in it

Chorus:

This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
(*They claimin I'm a criminal*) (x12)

(*They claimin I'm a criminal*)
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat to fade*
