[Lord Jamar]
Well everytime I rock a rhyme that show Jamar is intellectual
Girls, STILL wanna get sexual
They try to pull me offstage, hopin
That we can engage, in some sexual escapades
Grabbin for the jewels of the fam
Actin like they never seen God rock a jam
In they lifetime, grabbin my lifeline
To flow fluid like Alaskan pipeline
Now brothers get jeal' when they see the God swell
Mad, cause we got your girl under a spell
Me and her had a talk, and yo she said she wouldn't tell
Now I got her on a train on her way to New Rochelle
Your girl wanna stroke but yo I didn't provoke
Now I got a leg behind a head and a yolk
("Now girl flex, time to have to sex")
And next time bring a friend for my man Sadat X
And Sincere, who's hittin honies from the rear
Goin strong, lastin long, cause he drinkin a stout beer
We don't fear if your man blood boil
Cause we know a place with some nice soft soil
So check the heartthrob, proceed to rob ya 'ho
By the way, we rocked the show

"One for the treble, two for the bass"

[Sadat X]
A quick move at a jam, homegirl got her hand
In my pocket, yo' girl, the one you call squeeze
Dreamin bout the X and ruinin her sheets
I'm kinda cool black, aight?
I mean I'm straight on the girl tip, but when your girl
Do a dip with her skirt on you know I puts a hurt on it daddy
So check it.. you know the crew that wanna act like that?
Wanna play the front with the poom poom fat?
Talk about your man, yeah yeah he got a gat
But at the end of night, you in the ho-tel
And if you ain't alla of that, you play the mo-tel
Yo I ain't the one for it if you can't control your girl
Take her by the pants and put a lock on it
And if that shit don't work, then throw the Glock on it
Mad stacks and numbers but I can't remember faces
Much less places, but I DAMN sure know the races
Strictly for weaker or a sweet soul sister
Be thankful that I didn't hit your girl I coulda DISSED her
But I lounged and maintained
But don't front cat, yo don'tcha slumber
I still know honey and I still got the number
So you be cool aight?
