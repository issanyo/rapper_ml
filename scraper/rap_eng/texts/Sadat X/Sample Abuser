[Intro:]
Sample abuser-er-er-ers [x3]
That’s what you are, you're abusing your sampling privileges, o
Nly sample two samples a month you can't just go on sample
After sample after sample- (continued)
Wake up in the AM, compose a beat (beat-beat)

[Verse 1:]
All I see is blinking lights, track boards and fat mics, nine-fifties
SB-12’s MP sixties , It’s Mr. Berry yeah i'm a warrior, so
In the booth see me dressed like Steph Curry. Heh, imprison
Me cause I sold crack, we made history turned a sample into
Soul clap, clap. I’m like casada if I gotta and I do it for my
Culture- fuck a dollar. It’s JS-1 so now we get into the theme
So genuine she let me fit into her jeans, the pain seem mute
To a fiend fiend just like the underground is to the mainstream
I claim king, and the aim is to make all these niggas think the same thing
The prince of thieves still a show to leave, so please believe im always there
And you ain't never here like weaves, breeze

[Chorus:]
Sample abuser-er-er-ers [x3]
That’s what you are, you're abusing your sampling privileges
Only sample two samples a month you can't just go on
Sample after sample after sample- (continued)
Wake up in the AM, compose a beat (beat-beat)

[Verse 2:]
My timeline stretch (stretch-stretch-stretch )
Diamonds still lived on paulie and I just left the school
Yard from playing with a Spalding, buck wild let me even more
P’s and we was young emcees strollin MP’s, track meet the beats
Feet to get the latest those days the greatest but that’s what made
Us (aw yeah) Pete Rock had niggas learning he was earning pool box
Meant to me that was korea turninG used to have Jamaican rum
We’d be in the basement he’d get busy on his rum
That’s where a lot
Of the wild cowboys come from
Back then studio sessions was packed
In, manhood was put to the test
When I first met Ness I heard the boy
Duck for things rare, well our professor was there
Forget this act here
The records I want sitting out, old man with grey white hair

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Did my first demo tape in Pete Rocks basement
SP 1200 yeah that nigga laced it, tapping on them buttons
Doin shit like it was nothing, makin hits that was back in 90’s
Something and my man extra P also known as my professor
One of the first niggas to make paper on them records
SP 1200 S-nine-fifty MP 2000 yeah he get shifty
Large Pro Premier P-Rock and Q-tip. Used to always get
Together building them beats and shit I remember Large to
Sample all types of shit putting together like hominy grits
Yeah Large and Show biz yeah they kicked it too, both of them
Livin legends what they supposed to do peace
To the Rock Steady Crew, true pioneers we followed
Yall for years yall mother fuckers dope

[Chorus]
