(Intro)
Yeah Dot X
Alter production
Wild cowboy
Alter production
Past to decay

(Verse)
In Paris and Marseille that guy wrote that blue and white
The solution, french revolution
In war there's death and blood, valles in mud
My grandfather fought his way in France
And now you got to darker dance nobody see
On the french Virie average Jess Joe Sally and me
Now ya knew what I bring
I'm the peaceful God, but I will back then
Connect Paris to decay
Alterbeats sent me yo I love it that way
These dudes is main men
The time is now, when your done,they shray me
Live every day like it's the last
It's good bread out there I need it all fast
Why didn't I last
I'm the God born from the nation
Civilization will never be the same
And as long as I'm healthy I say fuck the hall of fame

(Chorus x2)
Let me keep the sky goodbye, let me live me life
The way I wanted to slide, just set me right
From side to side without the bribe
Would takes somebody ,let's unite
Let us all survive

(Verse)
I'm eager, stall I'm a leaver
One in a million, you can even quote Aaliyah
From Paris to Geneva
Got a pocket full of bread same colour as my sneakers
Purple and white , shell toe adidas
Minnesota fit it , viking with a rebuff
I make you pay for what you say, so shhh
It's cheaper, the tequila and the margarita
Make me feel like Ike, when I beated up
I don't need that
I know tips so I gotta meet Banida
She laying on her belly, I'm right beneath her
I don't mess with lolitas or no skizzers
She get no bread or no refund
For Paris got me leaning like Pisa
You know the tower, they can't front
They know the power ,see my talk is foreign
Settle the score like Cliff and Lauren
'Cause I'm a G ask warren behind so many bars
I really need a barn

(Chorus x2)
Let me keep the sky goodbye, let me live me life
The way I wanted to slide, just set me right
From side to side without the bribe
Would takes somebody ,let's unite
Let us all survive
(Outro)
Travel across the globe
A tour to France
Bid with the elders
Ain't cheap
Travel across the globe
Pass the cane
Undeground hands mass
Wild cowboy
Wild cowboy
Wild cowboy
Wild cowboy
Andre the motherfucking giant
