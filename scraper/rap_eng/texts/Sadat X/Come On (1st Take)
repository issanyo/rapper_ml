[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Nigga was motherfuckin' hyped up
Nigga just grabbed a nigga and snuffed a nigga
And it was on from there wasn't nothing stopping him holmes
(What did the rest of them niggas do)
Them motherfuckers was ready for anything
Them niggas was packing burners, niggas ready to fight with them
Niggas doing what they had to do holmes
Niggas on the real flip mode homes
Niggas coming out like a motherfucker
Niggas was antsy, like come on, come on, motherfuckers!

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Let's go deep into the phrase, feel the sun rays
Off the forehead, everything is real
Biggie put me on this joint, so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it spin, hey dad, placed your bet on seven
Peace to 106, 108, 110 and 111th
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
With .22s in your shoes, yo, keep this joint cooking

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat?
Release the brainstorm to make your motherfucking brain warm
A strange form, something kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well, in God we trust, guns I bust
Got that disgusting, sewer-style dumping
And, uh, do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an MC wanna sing for a living
Take the beatdown we fucking giving
C'mon, motherfucker!

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 3: Sadat X]
I walk slight but I carries a big stick
Nobody pay me close, hey Biggie buy another toast
My shit is set off
Somebody screaming somebody is shot
Is it over Crack, or a nigga will try to act?
The big city don't spare no bodies
Call me papi chulo, to all the Spanish mamis
I'm in real form, ready to rush your dorm
Hold back your mom 'cause I came for your daughter
Is it time for slaughter, or should I pull the plug?
Sometimes I get wild lifted, and niggas tell me I bug
I claim now, this my set, somebody could be wet
Ayo Biggie, give me the word and I'll let out the herd
With that Uptown spliff, 45th inside the gift
And we can do this
Check it out

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on

[Verse 4: Notorious B.I.G.]
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
Huh, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lambsbread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give MCs the runs dripping
When I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello

[Hook]
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
Come on, motherfuckers, come on
