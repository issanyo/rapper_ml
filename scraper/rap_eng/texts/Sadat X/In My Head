[Lord Jamar intro]
Come on
Peace to the Gods
Peace to the Earths
I be the Lord Jamar
My man Gensu Dean on the track
Let's do it, come on

[Hook: Lord Jamar]
The knowledge in my head
Built the pyramids of Egypt yo
It's not a secret
The knowledge in my head
Its God knowledge, I ain't talking 'bout college
The knowledge in my head
Is given out freely to those that need me
You can't read me
The knowledge in my head
No!

[Lord Jamar]
It's what started everything in the Universe
No need to ask me the question of who was first
The Alpha and Omega, the Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head
Eighty five percent are born dead
Cornbread, Earl and me
Except now I'm the G-O-D
I'm the cream so I rise to the T-O-P
Y'all ten percent niggas can't fuck with me
I represent Five Percent of the tribe that know who they are
The sun, moon and stars
Put me on your track and I'ma run through your car
Show the knowledge in the head of the Lord Jamar

[Hook: Sadat X]
The knowledge in my head
Keeps us healthy and fed (Peace to the Gods)
The knowledge in my head
We alive, not dead!
The knowledge in my head
Combined with my passion for bread
Makes me go hard, that's why I call myself the God!

[Sadat X]
Peace!
You can too, the Five Percent Nation is a hell of a crew
A way of life, have a seed and a beautiful wife
Walk the sand, walk through the ghetto with the mic in my hand
I want the best part of all of the land, y'all keep the caves
Where do we go when they put is in graves?  Who really knows?
I want mine now, fuck waiting for shows, pay the God!
Don't eat that yo I think it got lard
Who dares to step in front of this squad?
Be shown, the Wild Cowboy, come get hit with this stone
Get too close and you gon' bury your own
Walk with the Father, why bother you ask?
Damn, you couldn't complete the task
It's like you walking around with a mask
Walking around dead

[Hook 1: Lord Jamar]

[Lord Jamar]
Is infinite like the number 8 laying on its side
Got the Gensu tape playing in the ride
Beats from the SP 12, you can judge for yourself who the best be
Ignorance don't affect me, knowledge is my shield
That's how I politic my deals
And eat meals from the cake that I chef'd up
We goin' digital now, nothing to press up
Nothin' to ship out, nothin' to store in a motherfuckin' warehouse
That's all I care about, keeping the overhead low
This my business plan, I'm a businessman

[Hook 1: Lord Jamar]
