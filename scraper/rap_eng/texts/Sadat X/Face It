Yeah
You Got Your man here and Sadat X,worldwide, J Rawls..peace
Talking bout whenever you came up
Yeah i came up in ah, in that time, when rappers first generated
Came up in a strong household. two parent household
All the black men did run away
Learned who i was from some good brothers
Original men
There's always gonna be nice
I was destined
Student
Enrolled me - and shaped my frame
The god slow a grown man i became
I was self thought but from others i caught
Mic styling and groundbrakers
Broke rules and took chances
Start it like out of few glances
Further engrossed me
Watched all - Followed nothing closely
Looked into my self and became a man
Got with the brothers grand
Seen the land
Build with my fathering skill
A machine
Supreme being
The all eye seeing
That's why i survive
I'm not saying' that i'm the best to lie
I say that i believe that i'm one of the top
I'm not going to sell myself short
See thats the life you bought
I knowledge wisdom
I'm understanding
That the world is demanding

Yes
Yes
Peace god yeah thats what im talking about.yo We've gotta let the young people know what this is what this hip hop thing is
See this new hip hop it don't cost you no though, it don't spread no knowledge it don't give them nothing man
But it's up to us to give them that knowledge, that wisdom, that understanding. my man Wise Intel
Drop a jewel on 'em


Why do we try to believe
Crackers ruling public schooling' doesn't impede the seeds
Wasn't it these that gave us 3/5th MC's
The recipes to manufacture dumbed down rappers
This is why i keep my hip hop tip top shape
My shake I speak awake, asleep
I hate to se ya lacking
Like my fish black and girls blacker
Poor, black and hated
But i'm proud to be that
Marcus Garvey, Bobby Marley make me proud to be black
Some prospectors have suggested my commercially defective
Black aesthetics needs an edit just so white folks cans get it
(inaudible) twice as hood as little weezy
I just rather drop a jewel or watch a whomb to plant my seed
Soon to pamphlet all my teachings
While i cough at all of yours
Each and all poor righteous teachers
Had to learn before they taught
Its like the seeds if you'll agree
They had to crawl before they walk

Sadat X and J Rawls, and how ever that falls
Let freedom, justice, equality be taught in the halls
Preached in the pool-halls where the black men frequent
I'm tired of seeing my brothers in the precinct
Im just saying
We got history god
There is no mystery god
The true or living
A civilized mans ghost teach wise living
For the babies im giving
They're the best part
Black man and a woman thats how the families start
Please educate our lost children everywhere
I'ma say peace and leave that in the air
Walkin 25.000 and be back on my square
I pollenate the seeds when im there
I'll die for mine
Freedom mentally and don't never eat swine
Cause thats foul
