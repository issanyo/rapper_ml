[Intro:]
Yeah love is love, you know, it's what it is
Had a rough year, got caught up in some bullshit
But my dudes told me, you know squash that X
We gon' go to Miami for Memorial Day
And play for a little while
Yeah we played, yeah boy did we play

[Verse 1:]
Now mind you, my shit ain't plush
But I get up in the morning, and catch the early rush
Listen yo, I'm playing with time
New York state say I owe for the crime
But at least they let me rock for the whole hot  Summer
Get my affairs in order, then some gwap to my daughter
My dudes took me to Miami, did we play?
Killed Memorial Day
Stayed at the Sagamore, had a penthouse suite And one on the fifth floor
Ate and partied with a crew of bosses
Cabana on the beach, liquor at arms reach
Came to town with a bag full of pills
Niggas real icy, and broads caught the chills
My dudes ain't no rap niggas
Just real grown men, who can manipulate the figures
Bitches throw in New York and Greensboro
Niggas couldn't front, we was thorough
Seen kids sing Jamal, cause he heavy on the wrist
Boy with a five day spread
Ten star dining, and ten star head
But still kept that thing on cock
I  ain't gon' front, I ain't trying to get rocked

[HOOK: Sadat X]
I'm still the untraceable, they can't rate 'Dat
One of the baddest niggas to ever grip this here
The Precog, read the blog
Still get a loose from Ack?
Nigga I'm from your block
Nigga I'm from your block

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I rip up body, if it smell real good
I might want to taste it, Ma I could
Let's get to mingling, mix chromosomes
Bubble type baths, oils and foams
I really love a reggae, all types of lust
Powerful hips man, I'm about to bust
You open up the door, she could see the seashore
Tempt me, make me want to stick it raw
Brought her to the crib, gave her her own drawer
I'm really quite happy, need I say more?
Will we get married, I'm not really sure
Tracey give me babies, at least 3 or 4

[HOOK: Sadat X]
I'm still the untraceable, they can't rate 'Dat
One of the baddest niggas to ever grip this here
The Precog, read the blog
Still get a loose from Ack?
Nigga I'm from your block
Nigga I'm from your block

[Verse 3:]
Now I'm the man among boys, the street settler
I hit you, and then hit your man, cause he being such a meddler
The Untraceable, went to war with the whole block
Squalor [?] no English for the Dollar
I might holler, let me call my dudes first
More local than mainstream, with my main team
We globetrotters and real grimey
I'd rather them be that way than bein' some-timey
You pretty niggas'll crack, at the first sign of a dust-up
Built non-certified, they brains is fried
You smack her cause he lied, you's a wild boy
Know the Wild Cowboy and where I am, and where I be at
See that grown man shit and be aware
Throw it in the air, might get lifted in the air
I come peaceful, but I will flip cabs on you
Don't say I didn't warn you, you should of joined the army
I'm about to arm me, set my niggas free

[HOOK: Sadat X]
I'm still the untraceable, they can't rate 'Dat
One of the baddest niggas to ever grip this here
The Precog, read the blog
Still get a loose from Ack?
Nigga I'm from your block
Nigga I'm from your block
