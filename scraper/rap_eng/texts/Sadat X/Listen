[Verse 1: MC Zuko]
Alright let me talk to you yeah? Listen
Whatever you wanna do you can accomplish it
But you can’t do it alone without a few accomplices
Turn your talent to practice and then you polish it
Whether you in the block or studying at them colleges cuz y’all too strong to be kept in as mental hostages
You shine too much to not be showing your prominence
2Pac said to keep our heads up and I’m fed up, cuz our heads down all on the ground just like a bunch of ostriches
I don’t do this for the awards or the acknowledgements or to brag about adding to my achievements and accomplishments
If mother-puckers are in the way then I’m bustin’ out the hockey sticks!
That’s a goal right there (Mark that)
The fruits of my labor, I savor my antioxidants
Nourish the body, nourish the mind
Nourish your soul, your life will flourish in time
Have purpose
You ain’t worthless
You deserve this, yeah

[Chorus: MC Zuko]
The clock is a time bomb tickin' down to our doom
It's a lifelong reminder that we goin' down soon
It don't only tell time it shows how much time we got left
Unaware that it's passin' take for granted what we spent
Here's my two cents, pay attention, listen

[Chorus: MC Zuko]
The clock is a time bomb tickin' down to our doom
It's a lifelong reminder that we goin' down soon
It don't only tell time it shows how much time we got left
Unaware that it's passin' take for granted what we spent
Here's my two cents, pay attention, listen

[Verse 3: MC Zuko]
Growin’ up I always admired the elder wisdom
I figured that’s why they always called me an old soul
Treat ‘em with disrespect then the kids will never listen to me especially when karma hits as I grow old
I’m on a miraculous expedition
Los Angeles is where I live in
The journey don’t stop because you met your distance
Go that extra mile like you at Church’s Chicken and decide why not cop some extra biscuits (Juicy!)
Shout out Notorious BIG
He got a flow so pneumonia sick
Being kind is the soul of my pitch
Whether I be on the mic or in a classroom on some podium shit
Respect the hustle, respect the vision
Respect the muscle, respect the mission
Expect a fumble, but learn from it
Don’t burn from it
Just work at it
Earn from it
Disperse of it
Immerse in it
Let's go

[Chorus: MC Zuko]
The clock is a time bomb tickin' down to our doom
It's a lifelong reminder that we goin' down soon
It don't only tell time it shows how much time we got left
Unaware that it's passin' take for granted what we spent
Here's my two cents, pay attention, listen
