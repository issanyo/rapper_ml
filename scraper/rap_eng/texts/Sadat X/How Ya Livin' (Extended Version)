X4

[Grand Puba]
Hey yo check it out
I'm livin' lovely - lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Peter bust her up and Grand Puba kicks the rhyme, G
Come on hun, you know my status
Get past them Pips that swung with Gladys
Nineties the right time, and I'll bust a right rhyme
Put it all together it'll work just fine
The style ??? sat on the bleachers
??? contemplate ???
Derek X, how do you feel about this motion?

[Derek/Sadat X]
We can proceed because I have the same notion

[Grand Puba]
You see it's ???, the style can't be taken or tooken

[Derek/Sadat X]
Brand Nubian is good for the booker
Raise your hands to the fans on the grand stands

[Grand Puba]
Because the fans pay a fee to see the two slam

[Hook]

[Derek/Sadat X]
'nough respects to the Puba, but let me get this wreck
And 'nough respects to Pete Rock, coz he's the dope selector
Selector, in fact that Pete Rock is a ???
Game on the stage on the ladies with the bigger butts
Yeah do a two step dance and be sly
Gave a wink to a G, raise her hand in reply
View to the front, clear the path for the mayhem
The next day ya see her, ???
Marriott, roll that ass like a chariot
Straight from here to Nevada
Oops get the ???
Hotel chain, ??? the lane
???
Here's ??? from the north, so MCs - step off
I'm paid but I don't live on Park Ave
Now when the 90s is here, then my style is to be ???
??? turn into a war
It's time to drop a bomb and my ??? is ???

[Grand Puba]
See I'm hot like an oven, Pu is good for lovin'
I could use it right now, to make this strong and proud
When push comes to shovin', it's Puba that you're lovin'
With Grand Puba in the game there's no need for the stubbin'
??? Myrtle, and as I jump a hurdle
??? wore a girdle
Hun was on a tuckin', but good for the... (ey yo yo hold up chill man)
Now bust it!
I had ladies in the eighties, but heinies in the nineties
Throwin' game on a dame is probably where you'd find me
(Hey yo Pu you's a bad mother)

[Hook extended]

[Grand Puba]
Hey yo check it out
Grand Puba kick the height to a dope beat found by Pete Rock
Who hooked the beat from a flick called ???
Of Tom Sawyer, ??? Puba's lawyer
Gettin' paid in the nineties ???
So lads check the stats, send it on a fax
??? max then they gotta pay the tax
I had a gift with this honey, she used to call me Billy
I told her she was silly as Milli Vanilli
See hun ??? the gopher, Puba's not a loafer
Not concerned about the skins I'm knockin' boots on my sofa

[Derek/Sadat X]
??? a pub, with a friend from my club
And Pete Rock is on the skins, there's no need for a shove

[Grand Puba]
Coz it's just the right person, never rehearsin'
To get paiiiiiiiiiid

[Derek/Sadat X]
Unless the person's ??? and begone
Find my boys and get on

[Grand Puba]
Get a case of the black and relax on the lawn

[Derek/Sadat X]
So give an A for the way I show this rhymin' display

[Grand Puba]
You see we gotta get paid, not in the minimum way!
