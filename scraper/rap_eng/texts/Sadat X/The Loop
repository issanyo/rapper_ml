[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Thug out
Fuck around pull the rug out
Drink nigga pull the jugg out, handle the liqour though
The end will come quicker yo
The muzzle guzzles and drinks blood
The east est character whole
Side of head was swool from the impact
I heard the crack the calico was heavy
Fired out the chevy as it screeched off
Dude reached off into the heavens
Seen the bottom, of his 11's
Man down can't stand down the steel
Ain't no appeal when that box get closed
No money or hoes is comin with you
When that thing come and get you
Yeah that shoe fit you thats the catch
Throwin dirt down the hatch
Soon forgotten, bone turned rotten
Gots man is plottin you an after thought- caught
Blood sport what the fuck you thought
Real niggas can't be store bought

Chorus
Born alone die alone, no matter where you roam
Born alone die alone, no matter where you roam
Born alone die alone no matter where you roam, I need a new nigga

[Verse 2: Stan Illa]
To be conscious is the last real trial of the new age
Wolves baboons lions roam around the concrete stages
He ain't look up the car muffled his shotgun
Babies outside no coats wind blows and they snots run
Esoteric knowledge that contained in these jeans
No true religion was presented ever be what it seems
TV lyin to your face how you believe the screen
It be that mirror on the water that reflectin the beam inside
Close friends died from pressure on the gas peddle
And pack hit me like the shrapnel from the blast metal
4th down safety scrammblin' for some more chips
Players might see the more tish if they hold slip
The game salty and sweet like the corn in the kettle
Niggas that know the time but ain't concerned with the bezzle
It be the pressure of poverty put the heat on the kettle
Type pressure create a diamond on a whole other level

Chorus (Repeat)

[Verse 3: TABLEEK]
They having a hard time
To hear the heart beat
Cries through the street
You layin on the concrete
Thoughts of being unbeatable
Undefeatable
Never ending was your story seem agreeable
But that ain't the truth biz
The truth is
Your physical be gone like the space in my tooth is
You want a long life
Maybe a kid and wife maybe a dog with fence named picket
Instead you cricket with the crabs
Sick with the scabs
Those be the breaks on the ave
And now here you
Where's the cape, the man just missed me
Glad I penned my escape
I guess its not your plan that the world evolve with
Lifes for the living and we all are forfeit
You get it, if so you live better
Its not a fly style
Bullet holes in your sweater

Chorus (Repeat)
