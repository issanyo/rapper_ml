Yeah you know what it is ,DJ Koss and my main man A.G. Andre the Giant present a new thing ,Natural High ,that's right a natural high ,get with that, AG,DJ Koss
You know what is it
Verse 1 :A.G
See the vision,touch it if you can
Complete the mission ,stick  to the plan
Here Ben consider me the  black hand
Good dude but when I write i'm a bad man
There's a difference from a hater and a mad fan
Use a  hater nigga face it
Took so many trips but i never fail
I know this road very well,yeah
I'm heaven send but I givem them hell
Now reader of a story only I could tell
Surrounded by babies but baby you'r the one
Room full of stars ,I'm the sun
And I rap so hard feel like  I cum
Once I said I'mma do it then it's done

Sadat X:A natural high ,what is a natural high ?a natural high is a good feeling ,a feeling of accomplishment ,a feeling of achievement ,mentally and physically ,you ain't got to be  smoked to get a natural high.I'm talking about getting high on life and good things ,good feelings ,good people
Let's go!
Verse 2:A.G
You should see my black berry
Her moma called it  a brendy
No passport ,they stamp me
Never had  a plan B, one man stamp (?)
In my zone stuck off this damn weed
Every verse it's a broadcast
Andre it's a Giant when my tour last
Guarenteed I forelast
Those the one's I called trash
No ? or gas
And I have the same view that Lord Jamar has
I rap raw cause  I had a raw past
Saw (?)and I saw flash
I saw Melle Mell and I saw cash
The high it's all natural defining all the rules
I made the work despite not having all the tools
Even  though we got more to lose we're not worried
That's the reason we look all amused

Sadat X:
Yeah you know what it is ,DJ Koss ,my man AG ,natural high,naturally fly, get by, know what it is ,get natural with yourself baby


{You can never make it rain or stop my sunshine
