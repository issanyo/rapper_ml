Shit, fuck this shit

[Hook]
Who's is those niggas makin' all that noise
Wild Cow-boys
Who's is those kids makin' all that noise
Wild Cow-boys
I say the uptown kids got to say something
To let the hash blow without coughin' mo'
I said the cowboy kids have to say something
To let the hash blow without coughin' mo'

[Sadat X]
Relax B, cause ain't no got damn problem
Ever since I was born it was Hell up in Harlem
Hot like 9-7 and I'm still point one
Fuck with old school beats like oh check me now
Coup Deville for this late night poet
Used to live on 7th, I rhymed about eights
Kidnappin' MC's who could not relate
Uptown has been my home for 25 years
20 real niggas make 40 million a year
Block to block, ya gotta bubble like shampoo
Niggas is gettin' ugly and life is still a gamble
My crack won't sell these niggas got a lower price
It's all good so I gotta get shiest
AK spittin' or should I do the street sweep
We be strapped in the tinted down black Jeep
Until X throw them lights on the low beam
We started buckin' off shots at his home team
He wanted money but he didn't want to murder kids
He wanted props but he caught slugs in his face
Feels good representin' for my crack turf

[Shawn Black]
Ah cat daddy what have we here
Wild Cowboys scheduled to appear
Life's no game, I'm like the travelin' man
I'm not a gun slinger but I bring my lil' man named Rueben
He'll do the poppin' then hop on the AmTrak
And see ya in September when the high school starts back
I'm like the fun packin' rapper
Like to work the art, Napoleon Bonaparte
Couldn't lead a war to party like the General X
The one who protects, respects, and signin' checks
And we leavin' and everybody's tore up
And nobody tells you, my style can't be stored up
I sound like another nigga WHAT!
Beat cha' ass down WHAT!
The Great X right here is like a monument
Wild Cowboys is runnin' the government

[* Various people talking *]

[Cool Chuck]
This one here is for the West or the East
I roam streets, ride beats, ride freaks
Dust rappers like a Hoover
I wanna buy land, groovers just for the buddha
The microphone demander
I get into shit, get out shit call me Barry Sanders
Wave your hand if your playas
I got the gat watch me blaze ya
Or cut cha' face with my razor
Tryin' hoo-rake mine, how the fuck I'mma shine
Corny rappers leave the mic alone
Cool Chuck style, stay cream like the cream on ya corn
I made ya girl moan, sexin' me when we at home
Tryin' to sex me when we on the phone
Style stays tragic like Magic
Some of you rappers just don't got it
Copeland Ave. makin' noise
Cool Chuck signin' off sayin' peace to the cowboys

[Tec]
I'm the ruffneck, cruise on maneur to the prosecuter
Glock 9 shotter leave you stunk like a sewer
I pack rhymes like a 9 in my holster
Put cha door up, I leave ya broker than a crack smoker
Little league MC's will freeze
Put my voice on wax and blow it up like the Japanese
Cowboys and we do it like Texas outlaws
Lettin' off four pause in the Legend
Cool Chuck, D-X, and Tec runnin' wild
Portland Ave style bury six rounds in ya crown
Fuck the hoes in the limos
It's all about the demos, order a dime to keep my mind stimo
A lethal, desert eagle, so whatever people
Ya be a cold corpse when the paramedics reach you
Cause I leak lead and niggas sleep
Get his head feet deep
Into the concrete street
Do whatever boy, do it like the cops fuck the crack slingers
Cause ain't a dollar gettin' spent when the gat stick ya
Uptown that's my project, can't stop Tec
While the triple X bin got my nine wrecked
Wild Cowboys makin' noise on the track, flip it
We represent for my boys with the gats, kick it

[Hook]
Who's is those niggas makin' all that noise
Wild Cow-boys
Who's is those kids makin' all that noise
Wild Cow-boys
I say the uptown kids got to say something
To let the hash blow without coughin' mo'
I said the cowboy kids have to say something
To let the hash blow without coughin' mo'
