[Intro: Sadat X]
Yeah yeah, 1-2-3 in the place to be
Emcees and DJs
Introducing my man Fokis
From the L.E.S., Lower East Side now

[Verse 1: Fokis]
Stand on my own, never let another pimp me
Boss status, bow down and kiss the pinky
Ring; lyrically Leonardo da Vinci
The music y'all making is shakier than a Slinky
All hail the chief, Fokeezy el capitain
Never make a move unless I got me a plan
General Sun Tzu, supreme strategist, analyst
In the trenches, preparing your banishment
Off in the XL, I'm living that young wild
Pretty little thing from the hood that got style
Plus keeps it gutter
Ass softer than butter
Give a nigga the business under the covers
Freak shit, sleeping with the enemy
Money's a friend to me
I keep it in the fam like a Kennedy
Jacqueline Onassis, Mark Ripo sunglasses
Sticking and moving like a young Cassius
Float like a butterfly, sing you a lullaby
Please don't compare me to none of these other guys
I'm in a class all by myself
I got the kind of music that's good for your health

[Interlude: Sadat X]
Yeah, throw your hands in the air!
Brooklyn, stand up
One of your own, your boy Livin' Proof
This is how it's going down
Check it out now
Check it out

[Verse 2: Livin' Proof]
Coming out of Brooklyn, I came to get gutter
Sucker emcees know the name, word to mother
Livin' Proof rock, it's bound to get hot
And these flows that I got make your stereo pop
Heavy be the game that came out of the borough
Chilly city NY, Airs white yellow
Chicks, I don't spoil 'em at all, I shot call 'em
And my black tees got the little man horse on 'em
Work price heavy, I'm getting it for the low though
Send Smith and Wes with my brothers, blowing cocoa
Fitted, nice brim on tilt right on the strip
And you know the True jeans got a whole lot of grip
Niggas always saying, "Livin', how you rock rhyme?"
I tell 'em like Run, I'm way ahead of my time
Like Rakim hook, the flow always amazing
I get the job done, call me Big Daddy Kane
No half-stepping, I'm about to be a legend
Smooth operating in the nine-oh-eleven
Mics got torn since long back in the days
Paid a whole lot of dues, now it's time to get paid

[Outro: Sadat X]
Yeah, party people in the place to be
Check out your man Fokis, Livin' Proof
Sending love out to Run-DMC
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay
