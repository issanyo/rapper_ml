[Chorus x4]
"Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops"
"Kick a little step as the Ep gets swung"

[Verse 1: Sadat X]
Yo, this is the stick-up boom music for styles to flow free
Did y'all know it's me or could you tell by the speed?
The Deuce Crew of the new, yeah, makes the whole shit clear, yeah
Give the question, I'm tired of brothers guessin'
The Nubian name brought the X a lot of fame
But wouldn't it be a shame if it all up and ended?
That ain't the plan I had, shit like that ain't intended
For the slick headed wonder, wearer of saggy pants
Old school kicker, reviver of the circumstance
Got a backpack with a fat stack of fact
I got a three-oh, so P.O. step back
I'm with the uptown baldies, kids that were low once
I kick for kids that's paid, I kick for kids with no funds
Whole blocks come for classes
Kids with contacts, kids with glasses
Hard-rock punks, crack-heads and even drunks
Wanna know the truth, so they flock to my roof
New York, I got the grip - I told ya, I told ya
This means war, as said by Sister Souljah
To think that the X would ever take a fall after gettin' all of this? Man, you're crazy!
The only way I'd fall is if I got fat and lazy
And I won't 'cause I work real hard
Wake up in the mornin' at the hour of God and make beats
Later, hit the streets for some 45th sweets
So, all y'all been told, black youth essential
From the hard urban blocks of Now Rule residential
That the God rocks real hard

(1, 2, 3, 4, hit it!)

[Chorus x4]
"Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops"
"Kick a little step as the Ep gets swung"

[Verse 2: Lord Jamar]
Goddamn right, the L-O-R-D J-A-M-A-R
Says peace and Allah U Akbar
Back like a motherfuckin' head to crack
Brand Nubian tracks are filled with black facts
Now, I ain't Humpty Dumpty, chump
See, I ain't fallin', you can go callin'
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Try to knock me off, you'll never see another day again
My seven-twenty-one-fourteen's ready
And my scope with the laser beam steady
So, if you're feelin' lucky, then come and catch a buck
How could I kill a man? Well, I just don't give a fuck
So, check out the dreadlock, make the dead rock
With my bald head, a-alike the tongue twin
We're bound to win 'cause God don't like ugly
You get slugged, rushed, raped, robbed and mugged, G
I don't wanna be the man, I just wanna make jams
Cuttin' sharp like Edward Scissorhands
It's '92 and of course we grew seeds
They're planted like a farmer, so let's reap what we sew
And if you're thinkin' that we're a hoe in the game
We gettin' wreck to your brain (to your brain...)

[Chorus x4]
"Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops"
"Kick a little step as the ep gets swung"
