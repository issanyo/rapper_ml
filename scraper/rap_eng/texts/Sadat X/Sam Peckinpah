[R.A. The Rugged Man]
I walk in the Pentagon with a blood soaked hatchet, leave the president's nose
Shattered, stretch his neck like go gadget, and toe tag it

[Vinnie Paz]
You a stone cold faggot, I hold the chrome in a jacket
Go toe to toe with a savage and roll you over a cactus

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Funerals are closed caskets, coke addicts, chrome ratchets
The whole package, I'll beat Moses on the head with them stone tablets

[Vinnie Paz]
I killed Kennedy, brains blown all over Onassis
I'll hold my own with the axes and turn the pope into ashes

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Designed frequency, I'm a holy divine lyrical deity
Even atheists and heathens and non-believers believe in me
The punk-ass devil was born soft, I'll piledrive you like Paul Orndorff
Steal his pitchfork and rip his horns off, I'm the born force

[Vinnie Paz]
Sick fuck, I'll skin you alive and then carry the bones
Load the Ruger up and shoot you up like I'm Marion Jones
Vinnie is out of his dome, Guinea that carry the throne
Gimme, it's that or be stoned, Trinity, that'll be home

[Chorus: Sadat X]
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
New jack pussy, young rappers think their rapping is good
Young rappers get treated like fetuses in planned parenthood
This ain't no Mickey Mouse, zip-a-dee-doo-dah Disney, it's the claws of a
Grizzly, it ain't Wayne and Drizzy, it's Thorburn and Vinnie

[Vinnie Paz]
And R.A., that’s my brother there, anyone who unaware
I'ma leave 'em stumbling as if they had a ton of beer
I'm from Philly, it ain't a sucker to ever come from here
You a pussy, you see confrontation and you run from there

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
What kind of dirty bitch did your daddy put his sperm in?
Kiddie porn web searching, pervert jerking, you serpents is Satan's servants

[Vinnie Paz]
You get slain for certain if you put your faith inside of Satan serpents
Stick the blade in you while I embrace you like my favorite person

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Stay in Hell burning, slaves with chains on your brain like a turban
I make Abel kill Cain and get bible pages reversing, brains
Bursting

[Vinnie Paz]
It takes a taste of bourbon for me to rape a virgin
And Vinnie deal with mathematics like an Asian person

[Chorus: Sadat X]
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck

[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Hands like Roberto Durán, it's the flight 103 Pan Am
It's the Gulf War between Iraq and Iran
Treat you like Indians I'm snatching your land, I'm more dapper than Dan
I'm Rakim I master the plan, I bring the roots without having a band

[Vinnie Paz]
Without having a fan I coulda never took care of my fam'
I coulda never done all the tours on the shores of Japan
Still would've slaughtered your man, still would've aborted the plan
Still an apostle from Sham, still I'm like God in Sudan

[Chorus: Sadat X]
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck
We 'bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fu-fu-fu-fuck

We 'bout to spaz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We 'bout to spaz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We 'bout to spaz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We 'bout to spaz
R.A. and Vinnie Paz
