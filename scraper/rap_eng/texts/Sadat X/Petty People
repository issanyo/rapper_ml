Yeah yeah yeah this is for my people in the BX
Where they still call me DX
And this is for my people in the Rou
Where I grew like a screw, like this

[Hook]
Petty people and petty individuals
And petty situations that my crew goes through
Petty people and petty individuals
And petty situations that my crew goes through

[Shawn Black]
Ya see, jealousy fraudulent, cats fucked up
Longevity, so I stay down lower
Till I blow up, still destroy
All these Shawn Black decoys
Plans done changed due to conflict
Cowboys, we bomb shit
And I put that on my kills
Let my rap skills feel
It's the Shawn B. black is in the second letter
I stay wetter for that green and white cheddar
And all my niggas locked diggy hold ya head up
The rap game, will never ever warden me
Cause I'm a rip from 96 to eternity
Stay focused, right days, nights paid
With X assistance, now we're whippin'
850's with the Mo Mo's dipped in

[Hook]

[Sadat X]
I've seen lip-syncing that's done fucked that up
They live show looks better on the video
But they can start with the hip-hop mess of MC's
Holdin' back wages from a nigga like me
Just burned, black burn cause he want a turn
I told ya it would happen to this comin' attraction
Let the billboards with plastic, all I have is this Massenburg
And they can't talk no more, I'm gon' keep on livin'
Fueled by the microphone and ass cash driven
Need to blow shit up so I can rest myself
In the best of health and have sex with my lady
Hey you don't get no ass cause you always lookin' shady
Sick nigga like you talkin' about bonin' Jan Brady
Lady stand by your man
Even if he beats you with the back of his hand
Ah, Sadat X is like the size of Texas
And more, cowboy quick to the draw

[Hook]

[Shawn Black]
You can talk to me, I walk with a ten
I love shorties, plus red heads, Dominicans
Cool Chuck and X brought me through
We good people
Separate all the evil
I say things that make ya bounce like springs
Bust my caps let them thug cats sling

[Sadat X]
You would have tears in ya eyes
Cause you thought you would rise
But ya side reads small again
Actin' like a hooligan
Wanna act a fool again and front the party goers
Hey alot of niggas know us but that don't make us soft, I snatch
I don't rely on this rap shit I always keep a stash

[Shawn Black]
After a rough game, I see them willy niggas flossin'
Next time I see em' they be layin' in a coffin
It's all off top, you know my rhymes guns and clips
Read my spandex, I'm all about chips
Evaluate, Harlem blocks hot steppin'
I crack a weapon before the nickel plated check in

[Sadat X]
Harlem the game is something I'll never leave
Crack stamp on the head be, vacation switch to plan b
If ya live in a glass house, don't throw stones
Hey I'm a made man done earned my bones
Been on the wax with the sick vocal tones
Fled Deleware got jammed in school zones
Ran into a tree at the university
Got into a gun fight at the skate p
Brave say division with my man 8-V
Smoke a dust plug is you crazy

[Hook]
