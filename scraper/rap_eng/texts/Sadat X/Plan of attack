Don't remember what to say
Don't remember what to do
What up, better know
I gotta just to let 'em know
Better have some type of method
Break it down for them though
Some type of plan of attack (in this rapbook here)
Some type of man u need to follow
Master Ace, Sadat X, Marco Polo
Understand
The plan of attack is crack
Did your man know there's (inaudible)
A work in progress
What's the meaure of succes
In laymens terms
I slay mens terms
Make my own rulebook
First in a cool hook
Now you acting like a winner
The advertiser don't make the whole dinner, standing in the center
Of a riot
Nobody buy it no more
The downloads is a easy score
Just like a greasy whore
The jerker opportunity
New York where's the unity
It's dog eat dog
Hog eat hog
How i beat the fog
It's a sign??
Everything I do is by design, the complex mind
Being a super ego
Ace you know how we go
At least I know how we flow
We last!
Forget days past
It's what we do now
The skill and know-how is the winner
Now we eating dinner
But that's something that seperates us in this rapgame
Something that's make you different from that next rapper
I'm not in for the short hole - I'm for the marathon
We still here, Sadat X and Ace
From then to now (2X)
Hey yo, you gotta have a plan
You won't make powerplays nowadays dawg
You gotta have a brand
Plus have a team
And it can't be all about the benjamins
You must have have a dream
Can't just rush on a scene (nope)
Thinking all you really gotta do is touch on the pream
And everything will fall into place
Cause it don't take much for you to fall on your face
There's is a whole lot of pressure
When it seems like
Everybody's soul sounds a whole lot of fresher
Wanna find your way through rap without a map, you
Get lost like them keys on a dressoir
Cause you know you made it when your name stays in the news
And you take your whole team eight days on a cruise
Everybody pays on them dues
And right now kid you lookin' kinda dazed and confused, c'mon
Now Imma let u know....if u wanna be a MC
My advice is to you
You better get a plan of attack
Plan of attack
Plan of attack
Only the strong survive
So update your plans
Or be broke just like your mam's
Don't remember what to say
Don't remember what to do
