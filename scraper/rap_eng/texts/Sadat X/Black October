[Verse 1]
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
And the way that I reacted might of caught me the case
But at least I get to be out for that New York Summer
And the court ain't hit me with a real big number
But I'm froze for the winter, it's a fucked up thing
Forgive them father, they know not that I'm the King
So from April to August, I'mma beat up the streets
So when I come out in June, I have something to eat
By then I'll tired of detention food
And who knows, maybe I'll be a changed dude
My Mother's heartbroken, and my aunts are sad
And since November 8th, I been tweeting my Dad
Will I be on the island, or bidded out on the boat?
It's up to Corrections, I don't get no vote
Had to cop to the plea, no grounds for trial
For eight months to a year, I won't see my child
In the fall, no blowing trees in the hall
No OT trips, no shopping in the hall
No slides, can't get out the insides
I read a psalm, and make love to my palm

[HOOK: (sample)]
(There comes a time when you want to be older)
(There comes a time when you want to be bolder)
(I love you more when it's over)
(I love you more when it's over)

[Verse 2]
Keep my commissary full my dudes, get my little snacks
That's why I'm doing joints now, to keep my name on wax
No fear, they didn't hit the God with years
But it's a shift in my plans, if you really my man's
If you really my fans, stick with me and ride it out
You know what I'm about, fuck what the papers  said
Radiohead, It's no street-cred
And please, don't send me no ghetto books
I already know about fights and hooks
And I ain't really trying to bang
Getting heads my thing, making bread's my thing
And yeah, I might need some new shower shoes
And damm I'mma miss, reading the Daily News
And I'mma need a big jug for juice, and maybe put the weights to use, no swine
They can lock the physical, but can't lock the mind

[HOOK: (sample)]
(There comes a time when you want to be older)
(There comes a time when you want to be bolder)
(I love you more when it's over)
(I love you more when it's over)

[Verse 3]
Mark this October date black, let's see if I fall in the crack
For shit like this, you can never be prepared
But in all honesty, I'm not the least bit scared
Maybe I'm afraid of the boredom
Can't walk with my girl in the fall, down Florida
Damn I'mma miss my class
If I could kick my own self in the ass, I would
And I'mma miss all my dudes
Miss drinking beer, and eating home-cooked foods
Laying with the body till noon
I'm already counting the days till next June
Make the time, don't let it make me
Take my girl somewhere, put her feet in the sea
Wow, this is really real, they tried to get a nigga to squeal and snitch
Tried to hit me with a lame sales-pitch
Keep the God name deep in your heart
If you do that, I played my part
This is no farewell, my genes can't be confined to a cell

[HOOK: (sample)]
(There comes a time when you want to be older)
(There comes a time when you want to be bolder)
(I love you more when it's over)
(I love you more when it's over)
(There comes a time when you want to be older)
(There comes a time when you want to be bolder)
(I love you more when it's over)
(I love you more when it's over)
