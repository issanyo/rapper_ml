[Hook x2]
C'mon, word is bond, we got it goin' on
(C'mon, throw ya hands in the air, in the air)
Brand Nubian'll rock to the break of dawn
(In the air, in the air)
It's like that, y'all, ya don't stop
(C'mon, throw ya hands in the air, in the air)
Brand Nubian'll rock the sure shot
(In the air, in the air)

[Verse 1: Lord Jamar]
Well, let me get a piece of the track, peace to the black
Peeps on the streets with the beats in the Jeeps, comin' back
In '94 with the raw that's against the law
It's the G-O-D, my delivery is C-O-D
Word is bond and bond is life, we got it goin' on tonight
Don't nobody wanna fight, they wanna see a tight show
Where some brothers might go for broke
Utilizin' the effects of the smoke

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
I pull cash to smash, make the blunt last
Fill it with hash, too and pass, don't even ask
In a flash put that ass in the grass
Flag is half-mast, somebody must've passed
We're makin your ass drip into the stands
Fold my cash at last, my task to teach the class
And receive somethin' more than brass and some glass
Make a brother work hard, long and fast

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Dreadlock, I set to rock for my block
Clock wax like crack, samplin' from old stacks
That's where the soul's at in this whole rap universe
We kick the funky tunes with a verse
Sun, moon and star, some boom for Jamar
To get me in the flow, now I'm read' to go
Set to show everybody in the party that we're nice
Without sippin' on Bacardi and ice

[Verse 4: Sadat X]
This style flash, Jamar'll be the shinin' star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
I'll rape the tape, drive along the interstate
With weight, wipe the slate and mob the gate
By fate, I'll avoid the court date, no legal aid
Everythin' is paid, why cause a tyraid?
If the money ain't made, talkin' millions
But spendin' pennies and gettin' cheap shoes from Kenny's

[Hook]

[Lord Jamar]
Now, let's take time out to say peace to the Gods (Peace!)
Bust how I release 'cause this beat is hard
We be the squad Fard taught to rule
Take a thought to the top, now I drop the jewel

[Verse 5: Sadat X]
I push the Cadillac DeVille and still be real
I drive a garbage truck and not give a ...
I need to earn a buck fo' the year
I'm through with buyin' wild gear
Just somethin' I can wear, somethin' fly when I appear

[Verse 6: Lord Jamar]
Well, now we're here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold
I told their ass to chill and they're still cold
Frozen 'cause they're not amongst the chosen one
Sun shines like a beacon, similar to how I'm speakin'

[Verse 7: Sadat X]
As I receive the mic for the last time, I clear up your past crime
All felonies can go, as long as you know
Brand Nubian will stand without the use of a band
We always work with a plan

[Hook x2]
