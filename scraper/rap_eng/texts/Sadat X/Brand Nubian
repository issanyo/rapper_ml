[Verse 1: Lord Jamar]
Brand Nubian function
A junction of three, collaboration in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms, tap a soul
Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo black it's kinda ill, we don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is "Brand Nu"
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
Four hundreed years and we're made to feel cursed
But now it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
You have to stand as a black man, Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of my force
See me riding on a jet black horse at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides the picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel
Brand Nubian function in conjunction with the three

[Verse 3: Grand Puba]
Brand Nubian, not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind, deaf, dumb, and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold (The black, the beautiful, the bold)
Now if this falls short, I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasa Kuma(?), Achmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To put it exact, dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on, gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup, 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel
Brand Nubian

[Outro]
Nubian, a native or inhabitant of Nubia
Nubian, A member of one of a group of African tribes that formed a powerful empire between Egypt and Ethiopia from the 6th to 14th century
Nubian, any of several languages spoken in the central and northern Sudan
And that's why we call ourselves Brand Nubian
As the midnight oil burns, our minds turn
Make a mistake and be fake and you'll burn
We're here to teach so you'd might as well learn
That the tree has the knowledge for what you yearn
Brand Nubian
