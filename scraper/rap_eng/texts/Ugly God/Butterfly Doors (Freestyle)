[Intro]
Bitch!

[Verse]
Bad to the bone, hate me now, boy, don't be sad when I'm gone
Took a break, yeah, but I'm back in my zone
I keep it real, never cap in my songs
I dip when I finish you, see me on TV like Dennis the Menace
My dick in her mouth, she can't finish her sentence
I ran up a check and then dipped for a minute
Your bih let me hit it when she wanna kick it
I'm young and I'm rich and I'm dripping like liquid
When I shoot my shot, I'ma swish it like Pippen
I ran up a bag and then whipped it and flipped it
Yeah everyone thought I was finished, I get it, forget it
Every label tryna give me a loan
Be all on my dick and won't leave me alone
24/7 stay ringing my phone
I don't need help, I got me on my own
Pull up to the party, get geeked, then I'm gone (Bitch)
Went ghost and the people still streaming my songs
Man, I swear y'all gon' hate me when I'm on (Bink)
Ouu, damn, ya dig, this year I'll be in a Lamb, ya dig
Ma'am, you know who I am?
She eat me like ham, I spray you like PAM, ya dig
I get the bag and then scram, ya dig
25 thousand, put that on my necklace
Hating on me but your statement irrelevant
Thanks, Ugly God
Honestly, I made this song for the hell of it (Bitch!)

[Outro]
Thanks, Ugly God
Thanks, Ugly God
Thanks, Ugly-
