[Intro: Ugly God]
Nikko Bunkin in the trap, yeah

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Ayy, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Aye, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Bass bumpin', bitch I'm lit, say somethin'
Late night, early morning, cake thumbin'
What the fuck? What you mean I ain't stuntin'?
I make cake like a easy bake oven
Look me face to face, don't tell no lie
Get your shit together, please don't throw me to the side
Don't pay me no mind, if you just gon' waste my time
You hear this all the time but I think you should be mine
(Wit' yo' sexy ass)
Ain't no rush, take your time be patient
Tell the truth, save them lies goodness gracious
Lizard Man, Ugly God, Pussy Bacon
Booty Gang, underground sensation

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Ayy, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Ayy, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Let's go to Catch, go to Bootsy's, go to Vegas
Go to work, young Khalifa on your playlist
Go to church, but she still smoke papers
Go to Cannes, go to France, go to Jamaica
Eyes low, it might look like I'm Korean
Diamond chain it look like somebody peeing
Hoes know, niggas know so they don't try me
Keep it on me, you never know, these niggas grimy
Playstation, Dreamcast how I be ballin'
No games, fucked your bitch and now she callin'
Six rings, I'm the best like I'm Jordan
No look, catch the pass then I'm scorin'

[Chorus: Ugly God]
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Ayy, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck
Keep it real, what you doin', where ya at
Don't tell me no lies, don't waste my time how 'bout that?
Come get what you deserve, what's the word, what's the catch?
Ayy, what's the word, what's the catch? I'm at your neck
