[Intro: Yung Gravy & Lil Juice]
Go 'head, O
Oh, ay, ay, ay
Gravy Train
Danny, I see you
Uh, Yung Gravy on the gas

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]
I got MILF's at my meet n greet, I think I came up (bitch)
Flash flood every time they bring my name up
I was fuckin' with your mama, but I guess she changed up (whoa)
It's all good, Gravy switch 'em up like K cups
Ay, and your mama get nexted
Pull up on your sister, hit it twice and make my exit
Fuckin' on yo exes, just so I can flex it
Ay, god damn that's aggressive

[Verse 1: Yung Gravy]
Ay, this some heat shit lil bitch
Working out with some freaky bitches doing freak dips
Tandem bike wit yo mama told her she could keep it
Gravy get it poppin bitch I think I’m Pop Secret
Yeah I’m that clean
Gravy so sick bitch I think I need a vaccine
Yo mama getting Gravy withdrawals like I’m caffeine
Now I got a new bitch, think her name is Kathleen
Must be Kathleen
Matter fact, now I think about it might be Maxine
I’m in the backseat
Pull up on your mama in the Asics like an athlete

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]
I got MILF's at my meet n greet, I think I came up
Flash flood every time they bring my name up
I was fuckin' with your mama, but I guess she changed up (whoa)
It's all good, Gravy switch 'em up like K cups
Ay, and your mama get nexted
Pull up on your sister, hit it twice and make my exit
Fuckin' on yo exes, just so I can flex it
Ay, god damn that's aggressive

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Booty gang captain bitch my swag is so atrocious
I pull up on yo bitch and leave her hopeless I'm ferocious
I don't drive a Rarri but I pull up in a Focus
Ima fuck yo bitch and I split the ocean like I'm Moses
Wait hold up
Get the fuck up out my face give me a break, hold up
Ay, she gon cook me steak and say my grace, hold up
I put some gravy on her plate she love the taste, hold up
I touched your granny then I rub it in in your face, hold up
I play sick so I could flirt with all the nurses, ay
Take yo bitch and leave you hurt because I'm perfect, ay
Imma drip and she gon squirt and leave me surfin', ay
She gon suck my dick in cursive, ay

[Chorus: Yung Gravy]
I got MILF's at my meet n greet, I think I came up (bitch)
Flash flood every time they bring my name up
I was fuckin' with your mama, but I guess she changed up (whoa)
It's all good, Gravy switch 'em up like K cups
Ay, and your mama get nexted
Pull up on your sister, hit it twice and make my exit
Fuckin' on yo exes, just so I can flex it
Ay, damn that's aggressive

[Verse 3: Yung Gravy]
Chef-boy flexing like the Pillsbury dough
Pull up on ya ho
Turn off the lights and i glow
Paula Abdul with the flow (whoa)
Lately i been rapping fast but I’m driving slow
And lately I been clapping ass at the grocery store
I shouldna gone there, she got the blonde hair that don’t belong there
I think that weave needa get cut, need some lawn care
My timepiece freeze every time I put it on there
And everytime yo mama through she fold like a lawn chair
Whoo, yeah you know that chick foldin'
And then she cook the muffins up until that shit golden
I shine that booty up before I slide, like I'm bowlin'
Ice on my wrist 'cause that whippin' got it swollen
