Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus]
Hey, listen up, damn, I had to switch it up
All these bitches blowin' up my phone but I don't pick it up
I'm in first place but you ain't quick enough
You a goon on Instagram, in person you gon' stiffen up

[Verse]
If that booty lookin' good then I might grip that
Ain't no time for no games, bitch, let me hit that
You said you like chocolate, baby, let me be your Kit-Kat
I'm the goat, bitch I drop my own diss tracks, big facts
Fuck your backwood, boy, I can't hit that, ayy
Fuck your double cup, boy, I can't sip that, get that
All that shit you rappin', you ain't with that
Choppa with a scope came with a big kick back, get back
Fuck your house party, fuck your kick back
Let's get to it, ain't no time for no chit-chat, sit back
She suck on my neck just like a Tic-Tac
I'm a dark nigga, I blend in when it's pitch black

[Chorus]
Hey, listen up, damn, I had to switch it up
All these bitches blowin' up my phone but I don't pick it up
I'm in first place but you ain't quick enough
You a goon on Instagram, in person you gon' stiffen up
