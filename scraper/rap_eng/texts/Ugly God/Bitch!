[Intro]
Thanks Ugly God

[Hook]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch

[Verse 1]
No, I'm not a rapper, this the first page of the chapter
Bitch, I'm a disaster, bite your bitch just like a raptor
Booty gang pastor, I'm the hash slinging slasher
Pussy Bacon Escobar, plugged in like an adapter
All my music slappin', make you dance just like a Kappa bitch
Boy I'm broke as fuck, 30 bands straight from FAFSA bitch
Hoe give me some space, no I ain't talkin' about no NASA bitch
Gucci head to toe, you wipe me down just like a napkin

[Hook]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you know my handle, hump your bitch just like a camel
Bitch, I run the scandal cuz I'm lit just like a candle
I can't trust a bitch, I'm flippin hoes just like the channels
Young ugly god play these hoes like a piano
I'm colder than your cooler, deeper than the sewer
All my niggas shooters. piss me off they'll have to do you
I brought her to my room and spread her legs just like a rumor
I fucked her with no condom. but no worries, bitch, I'm neutered

[Outro]
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch
