(Intro: Michael Kurten)
Hello. Never really thought I'd be doing this, but...you know. It's for the Black Jesus thing. It's cringy but...okay. Uh...

(Chorus: Michael Kurten)
Make it rain like Noah’s Ark, make it rain
Got the crowd, jump around like House of Pain
Got this music thing, it keep me entertained
And I ain’t rappin’ ‘bout a girl or a chain
‘Cause I lack both
Not Lil Boat
I suck, but just know I quote
I’ll make it rain, make it rain
All I need is the cash like Gucci Mane

(Verse: Michael Kurten)
Always spit it raw like salmonella
Flow so black, but the skin vanilla
Last name not Jackson, but it’s still a Thriller
Going ape on the track like my name Gorilla
Yeah, I’m white, the sky is blue
But y’all suck worse than 'Culture II,'
Sneaking on my prey like a vulture do
Don’t know trash rap? Let me culture you
Ok, let me slow it down
Hittin’ on girls, like I’m Chris Brown
“Music” is my favorite noun
So I tried it out and already took the crown
All my lyrics contradict
Set the standard, make it strict
Then outdo that, but what’s the use?
It’s all a joke, that’s my excuse
Try so hard to make decent raps
But all these bars just table scraps
Stole the beat from Ugly God
But this whole song is super flawed
For instance, that horrid hook
Use the same bland flow, I can’t cook
All these pros, I’m just a rook
But with all the effort that it took
I accept I’m mediocre
I don’t have money, and I’m not a smoker
Compared to other raps, mine are just plain
But just know that I still make it rain

(Outro: Michael Kurten)
*exhale* That felt good. Let that beat run...
'In The Beginning,'
Whole team is winnin'
Black Jesus...yeah
