[Chorus]
Aye, 3 A.M. bitch I'm motherfucking tired
If we on the same page, I might motherfucking slide
Don't give me the wrong message girl, I'm trying see what's up
I don't mean to burst your bubble bitch but yes I'm tryna fuck
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck
I'm tryna fuck
I'm tryna tap that ass and bust a nut
Don't give me the wrong message girl I'm trying to see what's up
I don't mean to burst your bubble bitch but yes I'm trying to fuck
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck

[Verse]
Baby stop teasing
Baby girl I know you hit my phone for a reason
If you don't get loose or start freaking then I'm leaving
Girl you know I'm fiending, eat this meat you ain't no vegan
I ain't never begged a bitch for shit but bitch I might need it
I'm tryna fornicate fuck the shit that you believe in
Bitch you better twerk or I'm snitching that you're cheating
Bitch I wanna see a show, throw that neck and show some cleavage

[Chorus]
3 A.M. bitch I'm motherfucking tired
If we on the same page I might motherfucking slide
Don't give me the wrong message girl I'm trying to see what's up
I don't mean to burst your bubble bitch but yes I'm tryna fuck
Baby girl I'm tryna fuck
I'm trying to fuck
I'm trying to tap that ass and bust a nut
Don't give me the wrong message girl, I'm trying to see what's up
I don't mean to burst your bubble bitch but yes I'm trying to fuck
Baby girl I'm trying to fuck
