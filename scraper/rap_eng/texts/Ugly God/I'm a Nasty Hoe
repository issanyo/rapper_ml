[Intro]
Thanks Ugly God!

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe

[Verse 1]
I made yo bitch say "uh"
I put my hand on her butt
She said, "boy I'm on my period."
I said, "I don't give no fuck!"
All I said was, "I'm Ugly God"
Now her pussy wet like a duck
Take advantage of me bitch I wanna be yo slut
Face, Titties, Booty, and Toes
What I'm eating for lunch
Sit upon my face baby, I ain't ate vagina in months
I'ma dip your titties in Koolaid baby watch how I lick it up
I'ma gamble witcha' booty baby, lemme try my luck

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe

[Verse 2]
Ugly God A.K.A. Nigga Too Nasty
Come here baby put your phone number in my gadget
"Little Dick Clique", until they lay me in a casket
Young Ugly God toss yo booty like a salad
Same shoes everyday but bitch I'm still swaggin'
Motherfuck yo fashion, I could win a beauty pageant
Ugly God a legend, take notes in yo tablet
I'm ugly as the fuck, but bitch I'm still a coochie magnet
37 booties in my face, boy what's happenin'
TV screen, shawty on the scene like an actress
My hair on point but my clothes stay ratchet
Young Ugly God, bitch my dick game disastrous

[Chorus]
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe
I'm a nasty hoe, I'm a nasty hoe

[Outro]
Thanks Ugly God!
