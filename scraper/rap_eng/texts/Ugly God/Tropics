[Intro]
Nikko Bunkin in the trap, yuh

[Chorus]
Ayy, I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped

[Verse]
Everyday we lit (lit), baby, you the shit (bitch)
Knick knack paddy whack, suck a nigga dick (suck a nigga)
Leave him in the ditch (why?) 'cause he a bitch
Drag my name through the dirt, I'm swervin' down and shootin' shit
Lil' groupie bitch, huh, on my dick 'cause I'm super rich
Stupid bitch, I know the game, baby, all I do is trick
Ruler dick, got her crazy on some cuckoo shit
I'm with your bitch, and she blew this dick like a hookah stick
Hold on, I walk inside the party, I might spike your juice, huh (I might spike your juice)
I pull up with your bitch, whip ain't got no roof, huh (whip ain't got no)
I pull up with no roof while she give me roof, huh (she gon' give me)
Sippin' on this Goose, kickin' shit like Bruce, huh (kickin' shit like uh)
I put that bitch to use, then she get the deuce, huh (she get the deuce)
She give me head like moose, then I'm gone like poof (then I'm gone like uh)
Niggas playin' games, this ain't duck duck goose, huh (this ain't duck duck goose)
Bitch, I'm for the youth just like Dr. Seuss, huh

[Chorus]
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap, ooh
Take a step back, don't get clapped
I'm takin' off like rocket, lay back in the tropics
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drip just like a faucet
Now that bitch in my lap, she make it clap
Take a step back, don't get clapped

[Outro]
