Ugly God - Bumps and Bruises

Back to the bone
Hate me now but don't be sad when I’m gone
Took a break yea
But I'm back in my zone
I keep it real, never cap in my songs
I dip when I'm finished
You see me on TV like Dennis the Menace
My dick in mouth she can’t finish her sentence
I ran up a check
And then did for a minute
Your bih let me hit it
When she wanna kick it
I'm young, and I'm rich, and I'm dripping like legal
When I shoot my shot, imma swish it like Pippen
I ran up a bag and then whipped it and flipped it
Yea everyone thought I was finished, I get it, forget it
Every label tryna get me a loan
Be all on my dick and won't leave me alone
24/7 stay ringing my phone
I don't need help I got me on my own
Pull up to the party get geeked and I'm gone
When ghosts and the people still streaming my songs
Man, I swear y'all gon hate me when I’m on
Ouu, damn, ya dig
Bitch I be in the lamb, ya dig
Wait, you know who I am
She eat me like ham
I spray you like pam, ya dig
I get the bag, and then scram, ya dig
25 thousand, put that on my neck
They was hatin’ on me
Hanging on me but your statement irrelevant
Honestly, I made this song for the hell of it
(Thanks Ugly God)
