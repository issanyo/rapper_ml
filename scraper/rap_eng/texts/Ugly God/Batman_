Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Thanks, Ugly God

[Verse]
Bitch drinking all this lean
Got poured on my wrist
Stupid bitch you don't get no ween
I just want the head
Put yo bitch twerkin for the team
Baby we the shit
Make yo bitch do it for the gram
Everyday we lit
Yeah I'm runnin round like Pac-Man, I'm a black man
Call ya baby momma up and break the bitch back man
Now she need a catscan, and you a mad man
Ugly nigga new wave, bitch I'm up like Batman
Freshened up
Wipe me down like Mr. Clean
Winter fresh
I'm in her mouth like Listerine
I ain't never stressed
Might take long like limousine
Get it off yo chest
We gone smoke like nicotine
