[Chorus: Swamp G]
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th

[Verse: Swamp G]
We some motherfucking young shoguns
Shoutout to the motherfucking loners
Shoutout to the molly poppers wake up in the morning
With the shirt ripped open like Hulk Hogan
Shoutout to my people staying zooted
Shoutout to my people going through it
The day those motherfuckers said I couldn't, off top
I said it, motherfuckers gonna rue it
Yoshimitsu with the metal mask up, turn the metal flask up
Homie light the gas up, ladies used to pass up
This alien, from Saturn
Now they begging me to lay 'em down on the mattress
But I ain't a piece of meat, but I'm grade A
Pop more pills than FDA
I'm rolling hard, like FDR
And I'm fiending, for that 4-FA
Sit back, light a blunt, blow trees
When you in the gutter, man you gotta love leaves
When they counting on you, man you gotta do numbers
Some turn on you after just one fumble
But all I gotta say is just fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Fuck 'em fuck 'em fuck 'em, one time, fuck 'em
Cocaine and adderall solving my problems
I'ma pull up and say "aye" like Fonzie
Smoking a blunt while I watch Always Sunny
Alien baby so you know they shun me
Like I came from another planet
Marvin the Martian, he be my parent
Blackened eyes, into the abyss you staring
LSD seeping into my bone marrow
Dropping the acid and dropping the classics
Crashing my ship rather than let you pass me

[Chorus: Swamp G]
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th

[Verse: Ugly God]
Ugly Swamp making moves
Bitch you know I keep a tool
My bitch hot but I'm cool
Based vans, fuck your shoes
Best decision that I ever made, was to rap and drop outta school
Now I'm sitting on a half a million, no record deal, what it do? (aye)
She wet like a pool (aye)
Shoutout Lil Swamp we pull up on your hoe
And we make your bitch drool (aye)
Now keep playing games I'll record your bitch ride my dick just like a mule (aye)
Based till I die, nigga shout out Lil B one incredible dude (aye)
(Yeah) Now I done started the wave
Ugly God dark as a cave
I don't know how to behave
I got that work like a slave
Pull up on me if you want
I'll leave your ass in the dump
Ugly God don't got no cunt
I whip my wrist like Lil Swamp

[Chorus: Swamp G]
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th

[Verse: Acid Jonze]
White tee, I'm a born stunner
White powder, my nose running
White pill, I'ma go slumping
White ghost, I don't know nothing
White boy but I stay thugging
Fuck 12, I won't say nothing
Tiny phone and it stay buzzing
You pay up or I take something
Kick in your door like a raid
Taking your bitch and I make her my maid
Make all that money, put that on my name
Shonen Mulah been away for 3 days
Munching a bean like my life is a rave
I am so gone I said fuck being sane
Came outta closet, your pussy ass gay
Came outta jail and I ain't been the same
Paid off my bail but I can't break the chains
Might as well ball and just flex in their face
Running up bands while I'm standing in place
You are so broke and your life a disgrace
But it don't matter, we all gon' get paid
I am so crazy and my life the same
Got all that money but I cannot change
Only keep cash, my pocket heavyweight

[Chorus: Swamp G]
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th
Bitch we making moves, putting numbers on the board
Shonen Swamp came through with the samurai swords
Power Rangers, Megazord, fueled by Coors, weed, and spores
Spit that heat, like Al Gore, blowing up like July 4th
