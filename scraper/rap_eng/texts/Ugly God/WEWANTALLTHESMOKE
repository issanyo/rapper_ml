[Intro]
RED DRUM on the beat

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em, smoke 'em like a Optimo
You can find me pullin' hoes at the stop-and-go
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drop it low
Say it with your chest, nigga, we want all the smoke
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch, bitch, bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (brrr, bitch)

[Verse]
Hold up (what's up?)
Lately you been reachin' (you been reachin')
All the sneak dissin' and the subtweetin' (what's up with that tweet?)
When I see you, that's a bet and I ain't speakin' (I ain't speakin')
I'ma pull up to your block and get to tweakin' (get to tweakin')
I'ma pull up with the Glock and get to squeezin' (get to squeezin')
I'ma pull up with the mop and get to sweepin' (brrr, get to sweepin')
I'ma pull up with the chop' and get to eatin' (get to eatin')
I'ma pull up on a opp and get to reapin' (get to reapin')
Big drip (drip)
In that water like a boat (okay)
Sorry baby (huh), but I think it's time to go (huh)
What I do? (what's up?)
Oh, this your bitch? Probably so (huh)
Bring it on (huh)
Nigga, we want all the smoke (huh, bitch)

[Chorus]
Pull up on 'em, smoke 'em like a Optimo
You can find me pullin' hoes at the stop-and-go
Coolin' with ya bitch, I make her drop it low
Say it with your chest, nigga, we want all the smoke
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (bitch)
We want all the smoke (brrr, bitch)

[Outro]
