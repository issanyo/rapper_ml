[Chorus]
Big bag, big green Peter Pan, aye
Diamond chain, left wrist 20 bands, hey
Boujee bitch, clean nigga dirty hands, wait
One mansion, plenty bitches bring a friend, aye
Oou, (what's up?) and all these niggas mad whack
Runnin' with my sauce, bitch, give me my swag back
When I up this pole guarantee they bag back
I'm a big dog nigga you a lab rat
