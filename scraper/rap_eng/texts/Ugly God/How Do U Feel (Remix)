[Verse 1: Wintertime]
I been ballin' like a Florida Gator
Damn I coulda been a Power Ranger
Wintertime the new Anita Baker
You ain't talkin' money I'll see you later
How do I do it? I know they wonder
Almost got drafted by the Thunder
Wintertime I need a TV special
Wintertime I got a busy schedule
I see way too many opps (okay)
Pull up in the droptop
I like my Sprite chillin' on the rocks (thanks, have a great day)
Anywhere I go the hoes flock (wow)
I had grams in my tube socks (sock)
Pull up to the show, all the bitches like "Oh damn, Winter you rock"
Hatin' nigga you can kick rocks (kick rocks)
All my diamonds look like big rocks (big rocks)
This a rollie it don't tick tock (tick tock)
It say "GIVENCHY" on my flip flops (yeah)
I'm on fire I need to cool off (okay)
Pickin' up where I left off (iight)
I don't where no Comme Garçons (okay)
Catchin' plays Pierre Garçon (iight)
Beast mode I think I'm Marshawn (beast mode)
These niggas really bitches, Mulan (Disney)
Collect the bag and then I move on (I'm gone)
The car's right here but the roof gone (where'd it go?)
These niggas two faced, yeah two-toned (oh my god)
I body anything that I get on (woah)
Comin' of the top no Swanton (Swanton)
All flexed up, rob anything

[Chorus: Wintertime]
So how do you feel? (how do you feel?)

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
I know my old bitch not over me (nope)
A 100k to book me over seas
This year I bought a Honda Civic
But next year I'ma need the rover please
I done perfect the finesse (yes)
I'm on top so fuck the rest (fuck 'em)
And I did this shit with no effort (nope)
And you niggas trying your best
Me and Winter for the repeat (skrr skrr)
I get your girl and do the freak freak (skrr skrr)
I let her stomach be my baby sitter (skrr skrr)
Yeah I make her swallow all my skeet skeet (skrr skrr)
You get it?
She eat it up (yup)
She turn around and then I beat it up (yup)
I can tell you broke you never seen a buck (nope)
Niggas talking down but can they beat me up? (doubt it)
Niggas can't hang with me hand for hand
I keep a tool like the handy man
In person niggas not manly man
They scared of me like the candy man
I'm for the children like Bambi bam
I'm underwater no Sandy sand
I'm not your bro nor your family (nope)
You stole my swag and that's dandy, you bitch
So how do you feel? (how do you feel?)
Nigga you lame that bitch won't let you fuck unless she off a pill (she off a pill)
And nigga that's real (nigga that's real)
So how do you feel? (how do you feel?)
I'll send you my address so you can pull up so I know you for real but I know that you won't
