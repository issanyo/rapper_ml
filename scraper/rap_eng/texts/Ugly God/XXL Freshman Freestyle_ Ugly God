[Verse]
It's the Booty Gang captain
Talkin' shit to me is history
I hit your crib malicious
Charge your bitch just for an entrance fee
Ugly God finesse the booty live on MTV
And slide up in your bitch just like a missing piece
XXL got me acting wild
Now why the fuck you dusty bitches smokin' Black & Milds?
Actin' childish, just give it a rest
I get in her breast easy
Splash on your main bitch and then give her my next CD
I came up off of water like Dasani and Fiji
And I might fuck your main bitch, boy
You just gotta believe me
Young Obama, bitch, I kick it with your bitch in Tahiti
And I'll be beatin' my meat until they impeach me
Slayin' booty since day one, you can't question that
Made my own beats and made some moves and wrote some extra raps
And all the hoes be sayin' that young Ugly God the best at that
So suck my dick on soft and never text me back
