[Intro]
What's up man
Youngtyso on this mother fucker
Shoutout to Ugly God for the beat in shit

[Verse 1]
Yea I got big dreams
Niggas on them big schemes
Radio playing
One day I'm a be on big screens
Imma have it my way
And I'm not talking Burger King
I just worked that  48
I think they want a murder me
I'm not even that famous yet
I'm grinding like I'm Famous Dex
I'm working like I'm Lil Boat
Man I'm just tryna stay afloat
The rap game's like an ocean and imma tryna find the shore
And I'm dreaming of the day that I'm touring and doing shows
And that my music's in the air like water vapor when it pours
And I hope that I'm gone blow just like Ike Turner and his coke
If you say I won't make it man that's funny you telling jokes
And I feel like I'm Kobe Bryant
I'm ballin don't need a coach
And my girl she first class
And she will not fly coach
Man I'm learning all the science like a fucking isotope nigga

[youngtyso]
Aye man
No hook on this mother fucker
But we still kill shit though
Yeah
We finna come back on this mother fucker
Let's get it

[Verse 2]
Man I'm learning all the science like a fucking isotope
But I'll be sending word like a envelope
Youngtyso the goat
Rap game we eloped
Man I pray God
And I gotta whole lot of hope
I'll just  right these damn bars like the goddamn soap
Y'all seem so scramble Like the goddamn yolks
Finally getting heard like a crescendo
And send a lotta shots like a torpedo
Getting down to the business like a CEO
I think Kim k possible I think that she go
And I gotta lotta inspiration like J Cole
Niggas like to switch up like an alter ego
My life like a movie like Tarantino
And you niggas so fake like the placebo

[youngtyso]
Aye man
Had to kill that shit real quick man
Fuck a hook
But ight
Aye x3
