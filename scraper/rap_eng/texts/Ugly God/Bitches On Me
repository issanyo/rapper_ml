[Intro]
Young Ugly God, bruh
Bitches on me, you already know everywhere I go
I go to the bathroom, cafeteria, when I sleep
Everywhere I go, bitches always on me, nigga

[Hook]
I make straight A's, but these hoes on my D
Booty from a distance, bitch you know I'm trynna see
Ion' give a fuck, I take yo' bitch like a G
Young Ugly God, nigga, bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
I make straight A's, but these hoes on my D
Young Ugly God, nigga, bitches on me

[Verse]
Ugly God, giddyup like he on a saddle
Young Ugly God, finesse the milk out yo' cattle
No food and ass whoopings, you know what I came from
Bring that ass here, I squeeze yo' booty like a paint gun
Hoes cheer me on, bitch I think I am the mascot
Bitches on me, I feel like I just hit the jackpot
Ya' better watch ya' girl 'cuz I'll strike her like a match box
Ugly God, turn yo' bitch on like a laptop
Bitch I am a veteran
I look like Thomas Edison
Everywhere I go, people treat me like the president
Booty Gang, Little Dick Clique, is what I represent
Bitch, I got hoes from Argentina to the Netherlands

[Bridge]
When I see hoes, I pick 'em out like a afro
Ugly God, dick game hard like a flagpole
Dick real tiny, but she wetter than a tadpole
Bitch, I took yo' bitch, I'm a goddamn asshole

[Hook]
I make straight A's, but these hoes on my D
Booty from a distance, bitch you know I'm trynna see
Ion' give a fuck, I take yo' bitch like a G
Young Ugly God, nigga, bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
Bitches on me
I make straight A's, but these hoes on my D
Young Ugly God, nigga, bitches on me
