(b*****) bad to the bone
Hate me now but don't be sad when i'm gone
Took a break yah but i'm back in my zone
I keep it real never counting my songs
I dip when i'm finished you see me on TV like Dennis the menace
My d*** in her mouth she can't finish her sentence
I write up a check and then dip for a minute
Your b*****  let me hit it when she wanna kick it
I'm young and i'm rich and i'm dripping like liquid
When i shoot my shot ima swish it like pippin
I ran up a bag and then whipped it and flipped it
Yah everyone thought i was finished i get it forget it
Every label tryna get me alone but y'all on my d*** and won't leave me alone
24/7 stay ringing my phone i don't need help i got me on my own
Pull up to the party get geeked then i'm gone
When ghosts in the people still streaming my songs
Man i swear y'all gon hate me when i'm on
Ou damn you dig this shit rb and the lamb ya dig
Mam you know who i am she eat me like ham i spray you like Pam ya dig
I get the bag and then scram ya dig
25 thousand put that on my necklace
Hanging on me but your statement irrelevant
Honestly i made this song for the hell of it (thanks ugly god)
