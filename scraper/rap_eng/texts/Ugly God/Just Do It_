**Lyrics from Snippet**

[Intro: Boy 1 and *Boy 2*]
Hey, what's up?
How was that party the other night?
*It was alright, but there was this guy with his girlfriend and he tryin' to get her to do something she don't wanna do*
So what'd you do about it?
*I didn't do anything*
Woah, what?
Guys, don't be like my friend here who didn't do anything, not doin' anything is part of the problem

[Verse: Ugly God and *Famous Dex*]
Do what you gotta do, nobody stoppin' you
I'm posted up on the block like a prostitute
Talk down on me and my niggas might pop at you
Make yo main bitch ride my dick like a Malibu
I'm drinkin' water, yo bitch drinking Malibu
Now she said she want a sip of the Henny
You got a pistol, bitch I got a semi
All about paper, get popped for a penny
I pull out my dick on yo bitch and she gargle it
She say you pussy, you soft like some cartilage
Woke up like fuck your bitch, I'm feelin' marvelous
Pull up wit' sticks and my niggas start sparkin' 'em
So popped out, I'm walkin' downtown with the Glock out
Your time is up, nigga clock out
I feel like Lil' Uzi, I rock out
[?]
*It's what? Ooh, huh*
*I do, sippin' lean need a break, smokin' that dope take it right to the face, Dexter!*
*(Laughter)*
