[Intro]
Yeah
Young Ugly God, bruh

[Chorus]
Bitch, I got yo bitch

Bitch, I got yo bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
I'm young Ugly God and I'm ugly as a bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch

[Verse]
Ugly God throw that dick like a hail mary
One night your bitch, I ain't finna get married
Took her to the country, struck your bitch on the prairie
Kicked her off my farm, then I watched some Tom and Jerry
All I spit is heat but I'm still cold like January
Bitch, I'm young Ugly God, I'm so legendary
Ugly God, a boss, nigga you a secretary
Bitch, I got yo bitch, I eat her booty like spaghetti
Ugly God in poverty I'm living in the struggle
Ugly God splash on yo bitch like a puddle
Bitch, I got yo bitch and she blow me like a bubble
Young Ugly God did yo bitch like a puzzle

[Chorus]
Bitch, I got yo bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
I'm young Ugly God and I'm ugly as a bitch
Bitch, I got yo bitch
