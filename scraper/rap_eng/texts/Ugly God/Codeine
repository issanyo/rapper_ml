[Intro: BPace]
Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye. "BPace"
Real Northside shit man. (Naw for real)
Aye, Aye, Aye, On This Codeine, On This Codeine
Two Cups Stuffed and I'm on easter pink
On This Codeine, On this codeine

[Verse 1: BPace]
Two cup shorty, back to back like OVO
Finessed the lean plug, now i'm sipping in New York
Free Gucci Mane I met em at the video
& please don't bring yo bitch around i hitter, passer to the bros
Catch me steezing in my Bape, whoa
Bitch I'm geeking like I'm fabo
Hit ya bitch than I change clothes
Can't hear you niggas, Vincent Van Gogh
We lit, she popping, poured up, I'm saucing
Might hit you with the carbon, Aye
No swagg we an army
R.I.P. to Dj Screw, Yea I'm Texas Trill
Labels hit my phone but I don't want it less you talking mills
Gold off in my grill, hi tech got me sleep
Feel Like Soulja, nigga, mixing xannies with that fucking lean

[Chorus: BPace]
Codeine, Codeine, Codeine, Codeine
Codeine, Codeine, Codeine
Ok double cup stuffed got me leaning on a wave
Young ass niggas we just tryna get paid

[Bridge: BPace]
Purple in my cup, styrofoam Actavis
Came here with the gang & you know we getting lit
Might finesse yo bitch, yea we getting rich
On this Styrofoam cup you know we getting lit, (wooooah)
I'm on lean too, I'm on lean too
Purple Activist .. (Yuhhh, Woooah, uh-woooooah)
(Aye, Aye, Purple Activis)

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
I'm pouring syrup thicker than my bitch, man
I ain't shit, my pinky longer than my dick, man
Let me get a second with yo bitch it's over with
My dick little, lifestyle, ain't no trojan bitch
My bitch look like a grinch, but with a fatty
Ugly God flip yo bitch over like a patty
Tryna find me? I'm with yo bitch getting sucked up
I don't fuck with showers soap and water got me fucked up
Young Ugly God sniff the stains on yo draws
Cry in a cup I drink your tears with a straw
Ugly God take yo bitch down like a wrestler
Twerk on my mouth, I drink all your booty nectar

[Chorus: BPace]
Codeine, Codeine, Codeine, Codeine
Codeine, Codeine, Codeine
Ok double cup stuffed got me leaning on a wave
Young ass niggas we just tryna get paid

[Bridge: BPace]
Purple in my cup, styrofoam Activis
Came here with the gang & you know we getting lit
Might finesse yo bitch, yea we getting rich
On this Styrofoam cup you know we getting lit, (wooooah)
I'm on lean too, I'm on lean too
Purple Activis .. (Yuhhh, Woooah, uh-woooooah)
(Aye, Aye, Purple Activis)
