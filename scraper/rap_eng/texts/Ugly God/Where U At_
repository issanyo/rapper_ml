[Verse 1: MoneyatMidnight]
Where you at if you jugging and finessing
Where you at if you Bushemi and Giuseppe stepping
Where you at if you got the cash
Keep playing yea that’s your ass
If you got the cash then hit me up
Don’t ask just give it to me
Cash money want it in my hand
All you got to do is understand
Bitch, I want the cash right now
Don’t give me no check cause that shit gone bounce
Nigga I know you that happened last time
And you still owe me $20
Talking bout you switched bank accounts
Nigga I knows you's a damn lie
I need that big body bankroll, that dinero, them pesos

[Hook: Ugly God]
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches
Bitch, I got Bitches

[Verse 2: MoneyatMidnight]
Bitch I'm tryna commit suicide
Bet now I got your attention
Over here yea I'm tryna swim
But with these diamonds I'm just-a dying
Swim swim nigga drown drown
Look at my neck that’s 13 pounds
Like Jay-Z I got the slave chain
Get me some money get the same thing
12 chains and a pinky ring
All these chains I got arthritis
Loud pack I got bronchitis
I got the touch like it was Midas
Diamonds shining, diamonds blinding
So bright you can’t tell the time
Look at me now you epileptic
All from looking at my necklace
