Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
When I'm on the bus, I sit in the back
When I'm tryna fuck, she gon' give me back
Niggas said I fell off, well bitch I'm back
Spend a couple racks, then I make it back
'Cause I done got rich on these niggas
I blew up and dipped on these niggas
I bought a new whip on these niggas
'Cause I'm really sick of these niggas
Shout out Lil Boat cause I wanna get on a lil' boat and then drip on these niggas
They stealing my wave with the water shit
I was the first one to drip on these niggas
And if by any means if I feel tried, I'ma empty a clip on these niggas
