[Hook]
Everywhere I go I tote that big boy
No, I'm not no little nigga, I'm a big boy
I done came up, my name got big boy
I pull my dick out on your bitch, she say it's big boy
Big boy, big boy
Big boy, big boy
Big boy, yeah
Everywhere I go I tote that big boy
I pull my dick out on your bitch, she say it's big boy

[Verse]
Diamonds on my neck, dick hard like a crystal
Ugly God splash on your bitch fuck a drizzle
I'm known to use a bitch, all my hoe beneficial
Ugly God dick game hard like a bristle
I'm a nasty hoe, I fix a sandwich on her nipples
Your bitch on my dick, I'm in her mouth like a whistle
I done came up, I'm takin' off like a missile
Young Ugly God cock your bitch like a pistol
Niggas mad, I don't take baths, damn
I'm drippin' swag, I tickle ass, damn
Nigga I'm the GOAT, pussy nigga you a lamb
Young Ugly God sell your bitch like a gram

[Hook]
Big boy, big boy
Big boy, big boy, yeah
Everywhere I go I tote that big boy
Big boy, big boy
