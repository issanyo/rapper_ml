(Don't Do That Peter)

(Freestyle: Ugly God)
I spend a check on my neck
I got your bitch dripping she wet
Drip, Splash
Nigga please don't disrespect
My niggas they gripping them TEC's
I pull up and pick up that check
I go to your crib I put my dick in your sister
Your bitch on my line I pull up and I drill her
Don't DM me nigga don't hit me on Twitter
Damn, I am the G.O.A.T admit it
I fuck on your bitch cause she wit' it
These niggas so broke I don't get it
The fuck?
I need me a milli' let's get it I always say I need a milli'
I probably won't stop till I cop me a milli'
When I touch a milli' I cop me a Bentley
So let me stack up cause my pockets look empty
Damn
You niggas and bitches irrelevant
Bitch
I need me that check I pay hella rent
Cash
My pockets thicker than the elephant
Ya
I do this rap shit for the hell of it
2016 yes I need to be president
Bitch I'm the shit I came up and it's evident
Don't call me bro nigga we're not relatives
Bitch
You niggas is snakes
Yuh, Snakes
These bitches is fakes
Yuh, fake

Count up this cash

Damn

Say hey to my tape

(I Love You Peter)
