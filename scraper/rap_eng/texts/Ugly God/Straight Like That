[Intro: Ugly God & Wintertime]
Straight like that we ain't straight
That is not my mans I don't feel him do you feel him

[Hook: Ugly God]
I'm not your bro, straight like that
Please don't hit my phone, straight like that
Go straight like that, we ain't straight like that
Straight like that, we ain't straight like that

[Wintertime]
Shit ain't sweet straight like that
Please don't try to reach straight like that
It's straight like that we ain't straight like that
Straight like that we ain't straight like that

[Ugly God]
I don't fuck with you straight like that man
I been running 'round all day I feel like pac man
I got hoes I'm low-key just like Batman
Please don't fuck with me straight like that man

[Wintertime]
I went from pac man to the rap man
All about my bread I'm 'bout my cash man
Came up out the water oh so fast man
I can't play no games I'm on that ass man

[Ugly God]
On some real shit you could be a cool fellow
Or you could be a sweet pussy nigga cinderella
But either way I won't fuck with you on the regular
So don't take it personal I'm 'bout my mozzarella

[Wintertime]
I'm 'bout my mozzarella young nigga I'm 'bout my cheddar
A boy came up now they bitches want get together
Wintertime all the time bitch I can change the weather
And I'm still finessing persuading it's cause I'm clever

[Ugly God]
I pulled up on your bitch swerved up in a taxi
Gucci flip flops gym shorts head nappy
Bitch that's not your bitch cause that bitch call me papi
So do us a favour, do you, now we happy

[Wintertime]
I'm calling they feelin' em, I'm frozen they feelin' em
These niggas I'm killin' em, these hoes say I'm killin' em
They bros say I'm killing' em, pull up and I'm peelin' off
Give a fuck what your feelings are, I'mma keep juggin' em

[Hook: Ugly God]
I'm not your bro, straight like that
Please don't hit my phone, straight like that
Go straight like that, we ain't straight like that
Straight like that, we ain't straight like that

[Wintertime]
I'm not your folk, straight like that
Tryna hit me I go ghost straight like that
Go straight like that, we ain't straight like that
Go straight like that, we ain't straight like that'

[Outro: Wintertime]
That is not my mans I don't feel him do you feel him
That is not my mans I don't feel him do you feel him
