[Intro: Unghetto Mathieu]
Thanks, Ugly God
Unghetto Matt

[Chorus: Ugly God]
I put a hundred in you
And you still crossed me after all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, baby)
We had issues, but I never think you'd quit
Especially all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, what we been through)

[Verse 1: Unghetto Mathieu]
Ain’t no doubt we been through a lot
I'ma be completely honest, I miss you a lot
And I know we had some issues, believe me
Never thought that in the end
You'd turn around and leave me (Me?)
And you know I really hate to bring the bullshit up (I don’t)
You could've told me that you was uncomfortable with us
Falling for you is like droppin' out of college
Even though I never finished I still walked away with knowledge
First seen you in that class, you was hot as bacon
Best and worst choice I ever thought of making
But now I'm concentrating on catchin' this limelight (For real)
Cause real love gon' come for me when the times right (For real)
You threw my feelings out the window like some litter
Ten days later you hit me up like, "I want you back"
I seen all your subtweets on your Twitter (I did)
You just bitter cause I got you on delivered
Baby girl, I'm movin' on

[Chorus: Ugly God & Unghetto Mathieu]
I put a hundred in you (I put a hundred)
And you still crossed me after all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, baby, we done been through)
We had issues, but I never think you’d quit
Especially all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, what we been through)

[Verse 2: Unghetto Mathieu]
I had good intentions for you all in my head
It’s funny cause you did some of the same things I did
I was willing to go out and buy clothes for ya
And lose 99% of my hoes for ya
Talkin bout I barely ever made time for you
Was out here tryna make a nickel and a dime for you
Now here she come with the bullshit
Now that she see the man on my shoes doing a full split
She told me that she love me, and I told her, "Cool it"
Because I ain't tryna dive into another pool pit
You wasn’t happy with me and you made it clear as day
So even if we made it work it wouldn't feel the same
I be on the road and it drove you insane
So while I was on my grind you was creeping with a lame
Left a paragraph in my iMessage with an “IMU”
That's too bad cause there ain't no more I and you
I forgive you though

[Chorus: Ugly God & Unghetto Mathieu]
I put a hundred in you (I put a hundred in you)
And you still crossed me after all that we done been through, baby
(You crossed me, baby, What we been through, baby, yeah)
We had issues, but I never think you’d quit
Especially all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, what we been through)

[Bridge]
Run, run, run
Why you take my heart and run?
But now we done, you was my favorite one, yeah

[Chorus: Ugly God & Unghetto Mathieu]
I put a hundred in you (I put a hundred in you)
And you still crossed me after all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, baby)
(We done been through, we done been through)
We had issues, but I never think you'd quit
Especially all that we done been through, baby
(What we been through, what we been through)

[Chorus: Unghetto Mathieu]
I put a hundred in you (Hundred in you)
And you still crossed me after all that we done been through, baby
What we been through, what we been through
We had issues, but I never think you'd leave
Especially all that we done been through, baby
What we been through (What we been through)
