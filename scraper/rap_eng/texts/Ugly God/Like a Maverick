[Verse 1]
Aye, I make music from my basement
I done came up and got famous
I'm the G.O.A.T. ain't no replacement
35k on my bracelet
Niggas is bitches I don't fuck with niggas, I can't fuck with niggas like racists
Hoes on my dick I put gold on my wrist now my neck really cold like a penguin
I pipe your bitch with this ice on my wrist cause she see my dick hard like the pavement
I got that guap now these bitches gon' flock B, I got your main bitch in amazement
Slaughter your daughter no savage
Bitch I'm the booty gang captain
She can't be mine, no I can't waste my time nigga I be doing shows and traveling
Bitch, I'm throwed off like a javelin
Get your bitch gone just like magic
I see that booty, I grab it
Ugly God ball like a maverick
(Thanks, Ugly God)

[Chorus]
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Get your bitch gone just like magic, cause I ball out like a maverick
I see that booty I grab it, cause I ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Get your bitch gone just like magic, cause I ball out like a maverick
I see that booty I grab it, cause I ball out like a maverick

[Verse 2]
I spent that check on my wrist and my neck, Ugly God got the sauce you can't handle it
Made half a mil' by myself with no deal, now they mad cause I'm cocky and arrogant
Let's get into it, no talking, let's do it, I think that I should've been President
If Ugly God was a candidate watch how the people vote for me unanimous
But wait (wait)
I take your bitch on a date
Ugly God live from the H
My new bitch thick like a steak
I sit back and thumb through this cake
Fuck a new friend, niggas fake
They slept on me, now they awake
Bitch I made hits like I'm Drake
Hey, gold on my neck and my wrist full of diamonds
Hey, these niggas is bitches and bitches be lying
Hey, don't call me "brother" no you ain't no kin to me
Can't trust a soul all you niggas is enemies
Biting my wave boy I swear you a mini me
Come at me wrong you get hurt boy I been a G
Now I'm on top the ladder bitch, look at my swagger, I'm sharp like a dagger
Nigga want beats, serve em up like a platter
She hit my phone, I put meat in her bladder
I done came up but just watch what I'm finna be
I just got me a lil bitch from the Philippines
She give me play cause I'm rich so she into me
Talk out the side of your neck and you guillotine

[Chorus]
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Get your bitch gone just like magic, cause I ball out like a maverick
I see that booty I grab it, cause I ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Just like a maverick
Watch me ball out like a maverick
Get your bitch gone just like magic, cause I ball out like a maverick
I see that booty I grab it
Cause I ball out like a maverick
(Thanks, Ugly God)
