[Chorus]
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up

[Verse 1: Gwap Lvrd D]
Ridin' thru the city tryna get my dick licked
Gwap Lvrd D tryna find another bitch
I gave her Gwap Sauce now she won't get off my d
I got lord powers I can tell you where you went
It's the Gwap Way, I can never fuckin' change
And I put that on my momma and I put that on my game
Disrespect me, I will slap you, you can call me Rick James
You niggas better watch out because I came to fuck the game
Fuck the game, fuck it up, nigga we don't give a fuck
Everytime we do a show you know we fuck the club up
If you a real ass nigga then throw yo set up
500 Gwap Gang, 500 Gwap Blood

[Chorus]
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
If you a real nigga, go and throw yo set up

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Throw your set up, fuck it, get your bread up
Lil nigga clean your room, go & make your bed up
I tell every bitch I love em just to fuck they head up
So much ice around my neck I got these niggas fed up
She do average shit with you but she get super with me
Fuck a black & mild, come & smoke this hookah with me
Niggas actin' wild so I keep the thooka with me
Thooka will make you cartwheel if you get stupid with me

[Chorus]
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
Throw yo set up, nigga
Throw yo set up
If you a real nigga, go and throw yo set up
(Gwap)
