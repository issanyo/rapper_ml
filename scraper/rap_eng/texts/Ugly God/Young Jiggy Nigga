[Chorus: Lil Steez]
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Hit a lick with the beam
Go brazy for green
Young jiggy nigga with the steez

[Verse 1: Lil Steez]
Young nigga flexing with the steez
Run his pockets yeah I picked that nigga clean
I be throwing airheads in my lean
Drinking purple flurp like my name was Sheen
Yeah I keep the work scale it on the beam
If she tryna twerk I'm getting in between
She said she love me I don't know what love means
I'm just bust my nut and get back to the green
Boxers be Hilfiger
Bitch I be that nigga
Finger on the trigga
Hollow tip might hit ya
Dripping sauce no A1
Steezgod is amazing
Xanax might take one
Gucci Gucci like Kreyshawn
Gucci Gucci like Kreyshawn
Bleeding red like a crayon

[Chorus: Lil Steez]
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Hit a lick with the beam
Go brazy for green
Young jiggy nigga with the steez

[Verse 2: Ugly God]
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Bitch I got your bitch she slanging neck on them knees
I'm Ugly God I make yo bitch drink my sneeze
I'm a dirty bitch my house got roaches, mice, and fleas
I'm a pretty bitch I'm so extravagant
Yo bitch wanna fuck with me because I'm talented
Yeah that bitch better fuck, girl ain't no abstinence
If she ain't fucking she gone suck this dick on accident
I'm a suck your toes and eat your booty in the classroom
I'm a catfish I pull your bitch in the chat room
Im ratchet I will dig up in your trash like a raccoon
Seen your bitch once she sucked me up like a vacuum

[Chorus: Lil Steez]
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
Hit a lick with the beam
Go brazy for green
Young jiggy nigga with the steez
