[Chorus]
Ayy, I was that same young nigga that was tryna get a hug (tryna get a hug)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna find love (bitch)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna get a hug (that same young nigga)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna find love (bitch)
Now look at these hoes on my dick (bitch)
Look at the gold on my wrist (bling)
Look at the gold on my bitch (bitch)
Look at the doors on my whip (ya dig?)
When I up this chop' (when I up this chop')
I make you fold like a bitch (bitch)
I'ma pull up with a mop (I'ma pull up with a mop)
And I'ma put holes in that bitch (pew, pew, pew, pew)

[Verse]
Look, when I was sixteen, found out my girlfriend wasn't no keeper (bitch wasn't shit)
Seventeen walked in on a bitch from the church suckin' up the preacher (and I ain't been back)
Ayy, eighteen I was down bad, thirty dollars for the feature (boy, you shoulda took it)
Nineteen dropped outta college, and I fucked my high school teacher (shout out Ms. *bleep*)
Then I turned twenty (I turned twenty)
Started winnin' (nigga, we made it)
Now I keep honey in my bowl like I'm Winnie (Winnie the Pooh)
Hey, I don't share my hoes, bitch, I'm stingy (bitch, I'm stingy)
And I look out for my bros, I got plenty (I got plenty)

[Chorus]
Ayy, I was that same young nigga that was tryna get a hug (tryna get a hug)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna find love (bitch)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna get a hug (that same young nigga)
Hey, I was that same young nigga that was tryna find love (bitch)
Now look at these hoes on my dick (bitch)
Look at the gold on my wrist (bling)
Look at the gold on my bitch (bitch)
Look at the doors on my whip (ya dig?)
When I up this chop' (when I up this chop')
I make you fold like a bitch (bitch)
I'ma pull up with a mop (I'ma pull up with a mop)
And I'ma put holes in that bitch (pew, pew, pew, pew)
