[Intro]
Well, it's that time of year again, and I don’t know if I can last
What do you mean, you don't know if you can last? Last till when?
Till Christmas of course, whenever I sing about Santa Claus and Christmas, I get so, so impatient!
Santa Claus, wherever you are, I hope you're getting ready!

[Verse]
I’m losing hair and I'm scared and its too embarrassing
I move aware with the care of a true samaritan
Arrogant, staring with eyes glaring in merriment
Christmas time blaring the carols there in the air again
Maybe its me and I just need someone to listen
We can talk about my dog you never seen and how you missed it
While i stare at you amazed from all your flaws to every blemish
‘Cause this time here is for you, I hope you have a Merry Christmas

I'd like to sit on Skype with you and find the things you're into
So if I spent my Christmas there, I'd find something to give you
Or maybe bring a mistletoe in high hopes that I kiss you
And if I'm not you're type, I'd slice my heart right to the tissue
Or maybe put it to the side and be the guy you vent to
And if your god was really real I’d like to think he sent you
Or he’d pull me to the side to say I'm not the guy you’re into
Cause if he really answered prayers, I'd be right there with you
Comfortable
