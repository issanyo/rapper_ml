Tear Drop

(Let the game begin)

Doo-doo-da-doo
Da-da-da-doh
Doo-doo-da-doo

[Chorus]
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram

[Verse]
I’m like where did I go wrong ay
Where did I go wrong
With that Barrel to my dome
I feel weak I don’t feel strong
Got that knife in my back (what)
So you know I can’t go there
And my backs against the wall
I don’t think no one will care
I was riding till i’d die
But they only had some time
They were riding temporarily
And I was tryna fly
I be trying to make the most (what)
Think I’m playing host
Like a virus took my body
Took my money, now they ghost
Yah,’ yah,’ yah’

[Chorus]
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram

[Verse]
No I can’t wake up, wake up, wake up
Livin’ like i’m caked up, so high i’m baked up
Got me all up in my brain and i’m jumping on the clouds (aye)
Playing in the rain and i’m jumping on the clouds
Covered in heat (what)
Tats to my feet (what)
Covered in heat (what)
Tats to my feet (what)
Head to my toes
In the streets (yeh)
Cash on me (yeh)
Vans on me

[Chorus]
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Moonwalk with the Glock, I can't milly rock
Tear drop on my homie face, he caught a body
No DM, I'm her MCM on Instagram
