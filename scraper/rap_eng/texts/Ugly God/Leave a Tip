[Intro]
I'm not going anywhere Nikko

[Verse 1: Ugly God]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm flexin' on my exes
New bitch, she too wavy, yuh
I'm in Houston, Texas touchin' on a few ladies, yuh
I can't trust a nigga, everybody fugazi, yuh
I ain't text you baby, sorry, I got too lazy, yuh
In my Jeep back and forth to AutoZone
Sippin' lemonade but I still double up the Styrofoam
Pull up to your crib and serve you up like I was Domino's
Then I hit your bitch, she feel the dick all in her collarbone
Pull up on your bitch and turn her on just like a flashlight
She keep comin' back, she blow my dick just like a bagpipe
Niggas tough on Instagram, but in person they act right
I do this with no effort, I know these niggas mad tight

[Chorus: Ugly God & Splash Drexler]
Yeah, I'm walkin' down the strip with your bitch, I'ma rub her hip
Nigga talkin' shit, put that psh right up on his lip (brrr)
Ayy, I feel like the shit today (I feel like the shit today)
Woke up this morning, I might fuck your bitch today (Drexler, Drexler, Drexler)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (Drexler, Drexler, Drexler)

[Verse 2: Splash Drexler]
New play, new lyin' bitch
It's a new day, can't fuck no outta line bitch
Got a new K, threw away 'bout five sticks
Bitch, I'm Splash Drexler, check my motherfuckin' drip, nigga
Rented Beamer, goin' 110 (skrrrt)
Pocket rocket, Glock with the beam, huh (brrr)
No more wearin' seams (damn)
I know y'all ain't no team, let me fuck your best friend
Me and your bitch booted up at the Waffle House, hope that she ain't anemic (yuh)
Money counter beepin', need a red Hellcat
Push that bitch like a demon (push that ho)
Tryna get my racks in
We heard that you was that nigga for the past tense
Fresh young nigga, Splash Drexler get that pack in (yuh, yuh)
Look, look, look like money (brrr)
Smell like money, ain't a damn stain on me
Ayy, fresh young nigga
Bitch, I'm that nigga, ain't a damn stain on me (huh)

[Chorus: Ugly God & Splash Drexler]
Yeah, I'm walkin' down the strip with your bitch, I'ma rub her hip
Nigga talkin' shit, put that psh right up on his lip (brrr)
Ayy, I feel like the shit today (I feel like the shit today)
Woke up this morning, I might fuck your bitch today (Drexler, Drexler, Drexler)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip (and leave a tip)
Ayy, she gon' suck the tip and leave a tip
