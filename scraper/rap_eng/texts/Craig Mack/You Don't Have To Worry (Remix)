[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Hey…check it
What we have here…is another one
The remix
Orchestrated (You don’t have to worry)
By the Puff Daddy and Tone Capone
Yeah, rock on

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Verse 1]
Love is made, made of many things
One of them is trust, but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say, followed by the things you do
They won't hurt me, no, they won't hurt me anymore

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Verse 2]
Love can make, make a stronger man
But you don't love me and I don't feel you're growing strong
The heart you break with your simple lies
You better watch out, baby, the next heart may be your own
I gave you my love, my love, my life, my time
Mine was your own, though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked just you how you feel, if our love was the deal
You said “We got it goin' on,” now I feel that love is gone

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Rap: Craig Mack]
Don’t try to play me for that same, same, same
Last nigga did it caught a beat until this month
You’re goddamn right I want the fame
Plus a little horseplay if I get a off day
I wouldn’t wanna waste your time Mrs. Mary Jane
So I like to kick a little bump in your ear
My acoustic real sick type of hype a derelict makes shit real thick
The funk data that flows fatter
MC’s with that chitter chatter microphone even matter
Craig Mack’s like a funk robotic super sick psychotic MC who got it
The new season in cyber season crushing MC’s for no apparent reason
Mack man put fat funk out the frame…(That's funk, G)

[Bridge]
I'm alright, I'm alright
I gave you my love, my heart, and soul
You took my love, now you want to take control
But when a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay?
I can't go on another day

[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I'm satisfied

[Outro (over Chorus)]
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright; Why? Why? Why?
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I ain't satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright

You don't have to worry, I’m alright (Repeat until end)
