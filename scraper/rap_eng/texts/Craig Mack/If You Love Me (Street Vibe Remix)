[Intro:]
Word is bond
Black don icon
Rap's Gengis Khan phenomenon
Use MCs like a pawn
Extra dope and the list goes on
King MC, boy, rockin' Earth til the shit's gone
It's like that y'all
Brownstone in the house, Brownstone
Flava for 9-5, boy
One-two yaaaah!
Kick it real hiz-ot
Funkalicious fat with the flav
Funkalicious with the fat funk flav
Ha
Brownstone
A one-two yaaaah!

[Verse 1: Craig Mack]
Occupied and kick a rhyme and touch the sky
But in my land of do or die
Make the hardest [?]
A weeping willow, Mack's got your pillow
Superman with the master plan, stronger than your indo
Time's up, MCs put your pens down
It's over, grab a clover, 'cause your luck ran down
MCs, face down, wear a frown
'Cause Mackalicious is the liquid that makes MCs drown

[Pre-Chorus: Brownstone]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus: Brownstone]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
You know I really need you
Got to have your love

[Verse 2: Craig Mack]
B-bang, let's kick it off like a punt
More flicks than Alec Funt [?]
Leave you lost like a treasure hunt
I'm down with Brownstone, bad as bone
Microphone I only rock the planet 'til your kids are grown
Flavor dropping always stopping MCs in their tracks
And breaking backs
Craig Mack is kicking, that's the facts
Only if you love me will I wanna get down
Presenting Brownstone, the new flave in the '95

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, kick it for Michael Jackson
Kick it for Bad Boy, Brownstone, MJJ
Epic Black in the house, y'all
Come on

[Vamp:]
If you love me, say you trust me
Do you want me, baby? (Say it)
If you want me, show you need me
Do you want me, baby? (Say it)

Oh I, oh I, I'll do anything, babe
Oh I, oh I, whenever you need me, baby
Oh I, oh I, I wanna love you, baby
Oh I, oh I, I aim to please you, baby

All the ladies in the world got a man that ain't actin' right?
All the sisters in the world with a man that's tripping?
Just let him have it
Just pop on that Brownstone tape...
