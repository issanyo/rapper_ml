[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Fuck the whole industry!!!!
You tried to get rid of me!!! Y'all must be kiddin me!!
Y'all must be kiddin me!!! Aiyyo fuck the whole industry!!!
Come on!!! Staten Island! Come on! Hold me down!!!

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Monster cut truck balley shit
Champagne spillin while we hittin every bump that my Denali hit
Outfit is four thousand and better
The rhinestones in my flintstones look crazy in my sweater
Pah, it's not a big fairy tale that's my M.O
Fuck bitches on the rag with no problemo
Iceberg, rabbits, in the Foxhills Mall
Where I copped two more, brought four for RZA
Bad Boy thank you for this special delivery
Catch me by the pool in my Tony Starks slippers
Wonder Woman armed, Ghost is intelligent
Made 30 off of dust dime I was killin 'em
Did cash on One-Sixteen I was feelin 'em
Them days kept a crisp coke dollar bill on 'em
I lived it out -- special delivery
I spit it out -- special delivery
I sniffed it out -- special delivery

[Hook: P. Diddy]

Aiyyo! Aiyyo!
Signed, sealed, delivered in just the nick of time
Rare, I'm a give it to 'em my design is rhyme in the ghettoist form
Show power the child of the ghetto is born
Uh, feet first, preach give a speech I kick ya each verse
Groove let the shit just spit now it's dirt
Death pressin ya and ya like a hustler on the first ya need work
Stand by the grand high exhaulted
At your door with a portrait of the raw shit
Picture that while I spit anthrax
On your cd, tape, and wax so stand back
You don't really wanna jump the gun
In the airless flow with punctured lungs
Go 'head and stand there and bump ya gums
If ya wan't the problem we can hurry up and come bury ya
I'mma play the courier

Yo! This for my niggas dem special delivery
Bang ya head off to this, fuckin up your memory
I'll shake your cradle and rock your boat
Buck 50 your face and then butter your throat
It don't matter where you been or where you at
I'm here now and I'm bangin, kid you softer than the Queen of England
Phraseologist natural philosopher wordsmith
Authentical metaphorical lyricist
Sharp descriptive writer, kill a biter
Panty raider, party exciter
Yo Murray what the deal - how ya feel?
Yeah I'm gutter what I utter got you timid hesitatin like a stutter
Oxymoron, don't be dumb

[Verse 4: Craig Mack]
Aiyyo you must wanna be in the Guinness Book of World Records
As the dumbest motherfucker alive
Figure you gon' survive
You couldn't move through my terrain, even in 4-wheel drive
And I'm your highness, finest
You hungry? Try this, buy this, livest
Uh huh, I take my rap style real serious
What you think it ain't...that serious?
I bang clubs and streets it's gettin hot
See Mack won't stop until Mack's on top
Young black america my CD drop
In two thousand and two, to change hip-hop
Most folks shake ya bones
I'm talkin cyclones and "Terrordomes" like Mel Gib-son's
My heat will cook you bwoyy, whooped you bwoyy!
