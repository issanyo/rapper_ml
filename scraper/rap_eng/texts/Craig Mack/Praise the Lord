[Intro]
Incredible Mack
Still recording
Uh-huh
When God comes down

[Verse 1]
Now I know, to the world, the rap I kick
Will make you think I'm a lunatic
Lost my mind, I'm mentally sick
But for all mankind, this is it
New kingdom on the earth where the devil don't fit
No more bad times and no more wars
New Jerusalem, the city with the gold on the floors
Righteous laws, a thousand year [pause?]
The earth rejuvenated, Christ illuminated
I fight for the cause, kick down doors
The devil set up and I'm about to erupt
Mack's a warrior, I wear the armor of God
Fix your face, raise the bass, and stop lookin' so hard
You see, praisin' the Lord is easy for me
Craig Mack's right where he's supposed to be
You not close to me, you foes to me
The saints praise God and the Pope praises rosary
See, we about to take it to the next millenium
On Judgement Day, I know where He sendin' 'em
The earth and God on one accord
And I'll be in the choir singin', "Praise the Lord"

[Chorus 1]
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
(Boyy)

[Verse 2]
Now y'all ask the question, "Where's Craig Mack?"
Then you two played me at the Tabernac'
Jumpin' up and down with the Prophet of God
Givin' praise to my King who was bruised and scarred
Set me free, gave me a charge
A night to remember like El DeBarge
Gave away my cars, turned in all my guns
'Cause the Mack stayed with beef like hamburger buns
Sold my home, moved my family
South Carolina, y'all could stay mad at me
If I stayed in New York, it's just another tragedy
So God cleaned me up while y'all was still raggedy
Sore as a cavity, depravity, your face in calamity
Your ego on a high like we ain't got gravity
Your majesty, please forgive
This world gives you death, but I wanna live
What you gonna do When God Comes?
To me, the best song on the album
If you don't turn around, you know the outcome
'Cause Hell's a place that you ain't never comin' out from

[Chorus 2]
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
One God, one Savior, one Lord, all aboard
Singin', "Praise the Lord"
(Boyy, c'mon)

[Verse 3]
I mean, look at all this hate stuff and gay stuff
Men wearin' make-up
Sodomy and bodily parts that don't fit
Lesbians and thespians and sacred planetarians
Aquarians and Martians, and angels and guardians, they partyin'
Puttin' fake food in their body and they pottyin'
Head-choppin', nerve-droppin', [?] face cryin'
Terrorists is bombin' 'em and governments that's armin' 'em
These are the last days [?]
When God comes down to burn like sun rays
They got you thinkin' that it's just a phase
But Mack'll tell you now give God the praise
Skies full of [haze?] to change your brain waves
They want you in the zone, they'll call your cellphone
Put a camera on your home, you never alone
You gotta [?] with a chip in his bone
The earth moan and groan, waitin' for God to come
I'm not alone, but I can rap 'til my tongue gets numb
If you don't understand what I'm sayin' to you
There's nothing I'll be able to do in 16

[Chorus 3]
When God comes down, before He touch the ground
You better praise the Lord
It's all upside down before He turn it around
You better praise the Lord
Jesus Christ is the only way you gonna be saved
You better praise the Lord
(Boyyy, haahh)
