[Intro: Kool G Rap]
Yo, Moss, let's go in
Yeah, act like you know
I'm out for that life

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Gimme a check
You know the team making mad noise
Real on the code, Richie bitches in the lab, boy
Sick as shelter life, wanna run with the bad boys
Helicopters snap shots, poppin' for the tabloids
Up in the club, burner tucked in the ass, boy
Vintage whip like Charlie Sheen's dash boys
Gettin' oral, from a bitch with a name that be immortal
Get stripped of all morals
From a nigga hardbody on that Queens shit
Stay robbin' hard, now world on the team dick
Exotic bitches, fat asses with the mean lips
Palm trees, water caves and serene shit
The arsenal up in the crib, take my ring clips
Tape her too, your girl wanna be on the scene with
Gas operator, rifle with 'em for the clean hit
Lifetime hood nigga, now it's time the scene quit
(I'm out for that life)

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Did every hood nigga wanna live?
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib
(I'm out for that life)

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Lavish dinners, I smoke with the winners
Sippin' Crew, blunts is big, Uzi's is new
Fresh pair of British, yo I sit with the chemist
Using iodine and morphine based in Guinness
Sneaker game is famous, jewelry from Qatar to Bar
Up in my G9, that's wood Mercedes
Living raw, clean cut, just me and a mean plug
Sell a few tons to my sons, Moroccan rum
Get burnt, light ounces, back in the mountains
We can pray, train with the bears and give 'em Airs
Try not go in there, press play, lines that Chef say
Established from under the building, we're the best today
Disrupt the leaders, it's on, yo, I'm squeezing
That's that, this is simple, plus a Biblical fact
To slay matyrs, yo we partners
In the culture, no vultures
Street legend, a legend
(I'm out for that life)

[Chorus; Kool G Rap]
Did every hood nigga wanna live?
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
Yo, you can take a nigga out the hood
But not the hood out a nigga
Be in Hollywood OD'ing like River
Me and all my niggas in and out of dope cars
But bread can't hang from your favorite show stars
Cage these stingrays, shades for the sun rays
Chick with a head scarf, Marilyn Monroe shades
Made by Chloe, that's at least three-thousand
On a bitch eyes, act like you know me!
90 on the highway, you looking at him sideways
Blinded by the Liberace diamond, a peon way
Doing it the live way, black unlimited
Pull up in some shit that make the city look primitive
K-G-R carved in the gates on the premises
Lime on the eyelids, taking off the blemishes
20 to the tailor for the suits with suspenders
Hood nigga tryna bag a bitch for the winter
(I'm out for that life)

[Chorus: Kool G Rap]
Did every hood nigga wanna live?
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib
200 on the whip, half a mil on the crib
(I'm out for that life)

I'm out for that life
