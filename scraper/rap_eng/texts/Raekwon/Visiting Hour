[Intro: Andra Day]
I wanna be where you are
Where you are

[Hook: Andra Day]
You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Got to stay on my feet, I can't slip
Remain focused because these vultures are lurking
Praying I don't win
But they can forget about it because I ran for this
Yeah tears and sweat devoting my life I planned for this
Keeping the slammer close, I'm not alone
Smoking that black cabbage
Making my enemies go poof begone
So the facts is
Money make niggas throw rocks at the throne
I'm thinking
Spoilin' their action
Reality is I mean business
Please stay out my way
For real I'm serious, negativity out my space
I wear grown man britches, this is no child's play
Making haters love me
So our relationship is love/hate
See I describe great
And you despise that
Putting pressure back in this game
Word from this live cat
Niggas besides that
I'm from a place where most don't make it out alive
And homicide can't even buy that

[Hook: Andra Day]
You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Some of my niggas is still taking penitentiary chances
Life lessons
They never learned whether they lived or die
They not concerned
Caught in the system
Flips, they got mouths to feed
By any means they got to earn
Who am I to knock 'em
If they cover their faces stocking
Run up in the spots and let the Glock kick
That used to be me
Young, ruthless, and carefree
Until I seen the bigger picture
Shifted, my way of thinking
That 25 to life is real
So is the casket once it close on you
Word to the youth
Its not a game, cause life'll swerve on you
And she's a bitch
And could care less about the nerves on you
To either what I'm saying
One day it might change your life
From poor to rich living
Better fresher in white leather
From out the hand me downs
Flashing high-priced threads
Matching the foreign cars in the driveway
Living that wealth forever
From me to you young world
Here's my letter

[Hook: Andra Day]
You see my heart won't let up
I'm trying not to fall
Wish I could write you a letter
I know you heard it all before
What I mean
What I want is
I want to be where you are
Where you are
Safe from harm
In your arms
In your

[Outro: Andra Day]
Coming from the city where they run out
You know I seen it all before
I ain't here to judge you, I've been down
You know I done it all before
Coming from the city where they run out
You know I seen it all before
I ain't here to judge you, I've been down
You know I done it all before
