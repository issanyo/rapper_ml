[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
Don't take this personal
You better act like you know
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted, nothin' was ever the same
And though
I don't need you (x4)
I still want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I, but I love you

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Six days deep, she left, she left a letter
On the stove, this how it goes, you violate the Chef
I know you was the mayor, but player I never knew
It would come to my love, oh dear, then you got numb
I'm uptown washin' the Wraith, guess who run up on me
Little strawberry, come on with this break, yo
Arguin', put your feet on my shit and bawl in me
Tears in my eyes, you dead wrong, pardon me
Faith the magical word, crack a few nerves, yo
She had integrity, expected me to swerve
But I didn't, stood right there, I know my limits
Know my ground, know my surroundin's, knowin' that I'm finished
Damn, another one lost, one more divorce
She gon' break me, it's tax time now, that's like extortion
Why me? The flyest of all who keep it irie
This is a black man's diary
Tell me why, queen

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down
And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you (x4)
But I want you
I don't mean to (x4)
But I love you

[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like em
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
