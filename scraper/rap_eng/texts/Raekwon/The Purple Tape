[Verse 1: Method Man]
Hey, lace your boots up, tracks get looped up
The chocolate deluxe gets scooped up
All my pigeons is cooped up, Wu’s up, Ws up
If you ain’t with us, chuck a duce up, and let us do us
Break a promise but not my group up
Veterans is dying and used up
Let’s see if they can hang, I’m already tying the noose up
I’m too hot, if you not, get you stuffed
Get you touched and get you shot or you cut
Young buck I’m just trying to toughen you up
Can’t let you hustle with us, ya ain’t struggled enough
Y’all been cuddled too much, maybe mothered too much
So the burner giving out loans here is a couple of bucks
Had a couple of scuffs, I ain’t saying I’m perfect
I ain’t cursing on the rhyme but I wrote it in cursive
Quote the verses, boy I flow with a purpose
Get that proMeth and a soda, come with the purchase

[Chorus – Method Man & Raekwon]
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to Chef tho, but still trend
My young’un tell em it’s them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em’ again
Wu-Tang is for the children

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Lab with the pole, slide down, I’m in the basement counting faces
Drunk on the slouch, count the spaceships
Jewelry to my knee caps, breathe stacks whores & sleestaks
HSBC see me getting g-packs, herringbones mad stones in em’
The voice is olive green, three doors I’m on bring my goons home
Puma’s on, points like unicorns, fuming in uniforms
What you wanna do with me, just sue me homes
Yea Half Mike half Nike, handle got grip
Got monkey’s out here ready to flip
We pull a stunt, grab knots, push cops, just for vengeance
For killing that real shit independence
Far glowing like blonde hair, probably be the way we be rolling
Let’s cash a check y’all bring the broads here
Until the sun burns out, ain’t nobody eating
We on your block now, Glock up or call the precinct

(Chorus – Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My young’un tell em it’s them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em’ again
Wu-Tang is for the children

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Deck performing on the track, call him Jeff Gordon
I’m still buzzing this is Hennessey the next morning
The upset talking, I’m yes y'allin for cheques
Bossin’ the set, you acting like my ex calling
Ain’t that a bitch, not the 5 or the 6
I rock 7 on my back that’s Kaepernick
I dazzle like a magic trick, fabulous swordsmen
Sort of like abortion I ain’t having it
S I ready for action, heavily cashing
We set for whatever, what’s happening
Cold like the weather in Aspen, flow everlasting
4, 5, 6, your head is crackin’, just a fifth of E&J and a eighth of green
No promethazine but I make them lean
I’m running with the real ya’ll chasing dreams
While the crowd go wild for their favorite team

(Chorus x 2 – Method Man & Raekwon)
Who is that up in the building?
Hashtag we still win
Raekwon no relation to chef tho, but still trend
My young’un tell em it’s them
Wu-Tang is for the children
They bugging, tell em’ again
Wu-Tang is for the children
