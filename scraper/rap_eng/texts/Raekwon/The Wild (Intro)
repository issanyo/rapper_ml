[Intro]
Yeah, back at it, right?
In rap mode again
Ill wild dimension where
We do this to the maximum skill level
That literature gotta light shit up
The Wild...The Wild right, the jungle with no rules
We run this forest bitch, we live by the water
We eat the fruits nigga and we speak the prophets that empowers strong prophecies
King Lex...
This album is dedicated to the honorable Mel Carter
Rest in Palaces, kid... The Wild
That's what it is
We're tryna take all the fly shit
Play like this...
