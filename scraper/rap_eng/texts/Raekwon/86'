[Verse: Raekwon]
Wood green jacket in the clapper
Catch me inside Mojito City with a stretched plump actress
Grabbin’ her thong, the light-skinned Mia Long
Rich niggas way back, the bitch do John
Why would you ever wanna be here?
Guns bigger than me here
I’m like the centipede, three pair
Wallabees, first pair ferocious
Guns from Scotia, everybody know I flow like oceans
Truck little pieces, how’re we gonna eat this?
I walk around fly, high, telekinesis
And my lady a well known designer who fell in line with me
And all she do is sell LV
We in the grow house, trees look alone
I built the Dutch Master train set, relax, you home
And watchin’ Carmelo when the Knicks go in
I’m playing my square, I’m in the front row, my bitch roll in
That’s not wifey, that’s a lover
She gave me some top, but how we met, she was alone with my brother
Givin’ twenty-year veteran good dick, came to my senses
Stay strong like old man in dentures
Wintertime rockin’ the fox, hangin’ with Bruno Mars, The Lox
Sting, yo, Nas’ pops
We gettin’ honeys, Rat Pack clique in my gunny
Blowin’ two Ls, Ocean 11 this money
Floss stays coolin’ on them horses
Hoppin’ over logs, long Polo boots, ownin’ them Porsches
Maxin’ king, everything Gucci
Just like the suits I play Saturday to stay in Jacuzzis
Brother Man, I’m floatin’ to mother lands
And came back with ounces of gold, wrapped aside, rubber bands
Hangin’ in McCormick & Schmitz
Doin’ my OG thing, slangin’ some ‘caine in the mix

[Bridge: Altrina Renee]
I’ll be flying to the islands when it’s cold outside
Matching furs, his and hers, got matching black cars
On my life, livin’ right, baby, love is no limit
Life’s good either way, 'long as you in this
