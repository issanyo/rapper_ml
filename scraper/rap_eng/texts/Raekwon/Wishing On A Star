I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

(Verse 1)
I guess that's when I'll walk in a chill
Grab a Phil, wipe the ashes off my leather pants, the vest is just lambskin
I'm the real Muhammad Ali style in the Phil
You know it, (?)'s my clique, Italianos
Walk through the door few deep, roll a leaf
Whoever want it, just sign up, I won't even beef
Ninjaz with heart, the payouts, the city is chaos
I'm feeling you, now go and make a move, he killing you
Searching for the big rainbow wearing a Kangol and a raincoat
Jump with the .45, it's Django
Flying in a new (?),, missing my man
You got a Christy in the can where you destined
They see the young cub come up, drop a bracelet through your burpees
Stay under the radars, no attorneys
Yeah gangster, stay gangster, made from Kingston
I wish real niggas would say something
Glorified getting it, guns on us, tons of trust
Few niggas in the slums is us, but hate being here
Just meeting here, thinking it's sweet in here
'Til niggas take your head off for creeping here
Far from the curb to the jails
I write poems to flip tails, and letters to judges to get deals
I miss the good days, you know, the hood days
Now we sit in mansions on good grades
The moments is raw, baller's is poor
Run with your boy, light and blow a blunt if you're bored
Take a flash when the (?), them niggas was ashy
Dreaming on the benches, don't bash me
Crying, letting the tears dry, no one I'm trying
Society rubbing me when I'm eying, where the love at
With war fears, hit the beers, just wait
Come up with a plan to hit a bank, what

I feel it's time we should cake up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Breaking our cheddar

I feel it's time we should cake up, baby
I feel it's time for us to split that together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Breaking our cheddar

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
To follow what it means

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people we ever greeted
And I'm hoping on all the days to come and days to go
And I'm hoping on days of loving you so

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see

I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
I'm wishing on a star, whoa-oh
I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
