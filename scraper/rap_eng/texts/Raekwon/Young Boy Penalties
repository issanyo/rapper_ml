[Verse 1]
Call 'em a lobbyist, he stay parked, this is obvious
He won't leave the block, his people gon' copy this
18 wildin', no cream that's sloppy shit
Need a real nigga to tell him that's jalopy shit
Wrong moves, yeah that old ass Monopoly shit
You need to play chess and kill all that cocky shit
You not hard, you just on some fake Rocky shit
One day nigga gon' smack out your choppers, kid
Yeah we all know that lockin' ain't watchman shit
Skinny jeans, long Timbs, ain't poppin' shit
Just real yeah, general with stocks and shit
Stocky, no Glock, just hand full of rocks and shit
They hold L's and get craned, that's popular shit
Gold ghost on some Phantom of the Opera shit
Take a ill toast and shop, buy more Glocks and shit
Stay away from petty ass slimes who watch your shit

[Hook] x2
Young boy penalties, when will you learn
Young boy penalties, when will you learn
Catch young boy penalties, when will you learn

[Verse 2]
Ay yo, no morals at all, you lost shorty
Don't know which way to get on, come on shorty
You should've stayed around on the real, get lost shorty
Now they sendin' your ass upstate for 40
You wouldn't listen, now you just runnin' in Jordies
Frontin' in the back of the building passin' 40's
You ain't just built for war, you for the ball leagues
But you'd rather front with them four niggas that's corny
Never get money, they sit yappin' they jaw-pieces
That's when they get broke, cracked in 44 pieces
Meet you by the store for the one vision of glory
Then I'mma tear your face off, it's mandatory
I ball forever, through any category yo
It's like a fresh Gucci mock against a Maury
Catch me in a pool full of sharks, I wrestle surely
The realest, fresh off the block with the porgies

[Hook] x2

[Outro]
Word, gotta school y'all little branch face ass niggas, man
Stop fuckin' actin' like you're listenin' to the wrong niggas, man
And keep them 71 characters out of your body too, man
Niggas is just fuckin' up the whole poster right now, man
