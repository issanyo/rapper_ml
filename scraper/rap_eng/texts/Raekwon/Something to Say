[Intro]
Word up
Yeah, yeah

Yo aight look, check it, it's going down
You know how I go
Wu-Tang forever
Parazitii
No question, no question

[Verse 1: Raekwoon The Chef]
Eh yo, get my Hungarians and Romanians love Chef
I sit fly, in the S-5 with the snuk
Check
You know the status
Big carats, up in the chain
It's obvious, there's no doubt in my rep
I smoke lots of good shit
Yeah son, running the club from here to U.S
Next stop Bucharest
Fly nigga with millions lay in the spot
Where the police never come
'Cuz them niggas is scared to death
Got my little hungry, little A-1's with me
Ready to blow something
Ray come get me
What it is yo ...
Stackin one jackin' like black bums
But got mad money
Throw us a check
I love Fly-Guys languages and niggas who ride high
All over the world my niggas supply pot
Rock fengashiz trying to get denashiz
So when you see us below this payments kid
Can't stop us
Yeah them Staten Island mobsters with axes
Who really get down, and shop Octopuses

Niggas stay flyin Gucci
If paper's a crime
Then nigga then shoot me
Check it out nigga Fly Killers call us the
Live 5 deadly Venoms who got style
We got to get'em
You know the kidz meany
Regardless of the beat pop-off
We gonna get down
Let's worm Parazitii!

[Hook x2]
Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking

[Verse 2: Cheloo]
Stop bitching and get ready for the show
My rhymes are dirty like Christmas snow
Check the flow!
You know the plan is to see Parazitii on CD at low prices next to Black Eyed Peas
Fuck money, fuck tax fees
We throw shit on everybody from the nineties
Like this -
We are the white boys making noise
We chase ugly bitches with rubber dildos, big dick toys
I'm so fucking funny, what the fuck, I'm vicious
I don't believe in God, oh God, I'm not religious
Now it's time to come down from cloud nine
Where the weather is fucking fine
We can buy happiness with one dime
Only one time so keep in mind:
Life is like running on ice
It's like roll the dice
If you don't like prison, fool, you'd better be nice
I'm sending this message to the shit hole you call home
You invisible cocksucker stand by the phone
Grab a beer, pop the top, you can drink a little bit
If you feel shitty then you must be full of shit
Here is the message I'm trying to transmit:

[Hook x2]
Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking

[Verse 3: Ombladon]

My rhymes can make your instinct thick, [?]
Make no mistake this musical state is not fucking fake
You can suck my dick and relocate
For me drinking is a sport â€“ Victory!
Drinking up my money for child support
If my ship is sinking, don't come aboard
And save all your fucking prayers for the Lord
I'm always ready to drink my way through life
As I hold my dick and piss all night
As a new born child I never sucked milk from my mom's tit
'Cuz my dick gets hard - this I have to admit
I'm so sick, but my mind is bright
And I can bang your wife at cityhall in the daylight
People like good news and happy endings
I like fine bitches on their knees, I'm standing
All women are bitches except my lady back home
And of course your bitch if you don't listen to this alone

[Hook x2]
Fuck money, fuck grammar, fuck fashion
I've got something to say
My words have passion
Arrest me for thinking, arrest me for smoking
Arrest me, arrest me for joking

[Outro]
