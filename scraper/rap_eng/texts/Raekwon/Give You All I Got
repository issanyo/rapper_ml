[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Yo, met this piece by the name of Sharise
She had a fly 190 resting in Jones Beach
You know when we kicking my everday cliche
Yo boo, can I poly with you, what make my day
She threw her chin up in the air, said yeah
Your style is played out, black, like last year
What do you mean, huh? You know what I mean Dunn
Callin me Dunn had me open like I was the one
What did I have on God Guard or Clairborne
You know you had that rugged type of shit on Raekwon
Maybe I talk a bit, kick a few words and shit
But you drove off in some Nissan phat shit
Givin me bad looks, lookin like mad crooks
If I was a purse downtown I would have been took
Yeah from robsters, but you look like mobsters
Smoking that weed had me nauseous like Rastas

[Pre-Hook 1: Allure]
When we're together you blow my mind, uh huh
You have that way about ya that keeps me satisfied
(What you want?) All I wanna do is give you all I got

[Hook]
If I give you all I got would you be there for me baby (all I got)
And if I keep you close to me would you give me everything I need
The way I want it to be (that's the way it should be)

[Verse 2]
I wanna be there for you, boy, in every way
I just gotta tell you how you take my breath away
I wanna let you know

[Pre-Hook 2: Allure]
When you walked into my life (walked into my life)
I had this feeling you brought my world alive
And I'm going crazy, my head is in a daze (head is in a daze)
You amaze me, boy why don't you stay (boy why don't you stay)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
She's a fly fabulous bird from out of nowhere
We bungalo dolo in logear, free parole the whole year
Now acknowledge me, God mentality, fly formality
Cut out on me, I'm kidnapping half of your salary
We movin like this, for real now, shut down your will power
Flower, whatever you doing, don't disrespect ours
Slidin my work to the next man
Still I'm giving you props now gets your karats on the nightstand

[Pre-Hook 2]
