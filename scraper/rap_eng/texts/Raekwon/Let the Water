[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Reppin' this style, I'm higher than whatever in the 2000
I'm like Isaac in the ?scene age? days, gettin' 1000s
Yup, flip 'em in the M, suede Tims on
Blew housing up, they knew my niggas is proud
?Kens?, we vanish, sipping Kahluas we on the block frozen
Whatever, niggas wanna do us then do us
We like Roberta Flack and the Gap Band
And Curtis you urge us to stack grand
Scarface, we eat our grits with eggs in 'em
None of the roach legs in 'em
Watching Soul Train everybody dipped in denim
With beads on they neck and braids just like Stevie cover
You gotta see me brother, brushing my waves and now a few march
A few good men that carry cartridges
And smoke [?] now we all getting trim
They play the deuce loose, Old Gold juice
BVDs on, Adidas no laces, drinking pineapple fruits
But uh...

When people get shot down for not minding theirs
So many young adolescents with no careers
You got 10-11 year olds drinking beers
So many go home nigga hit up the Frigidaire, what

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
Rap apostle, run through pussy like a brothel
My shit's too raw, burn the flesh up in your nostril
New York City gospel, young black and hostile
Niggas making sales all day because they got to
Foul in the city I'm from we going downhill
Niggas catch beef, cock back spray a round, chill
Police giving permanent pink slips to perps
Young bitches got older niggas lifting up they skirts
That's a lack of guidance mixed with a dash of defiance
Adolescents get locked frail, come home like giants
We should go to law school instead of being lawyer clients
Respect the code of silence, big up my nigga Science
Outdoorsmen and Lowlifes got an alliance
Fuck I wanna work I'd rather hand out assignments
To uncivil civilians that post outside of buildings
On a quest for million by stacking hundred dollar Williams
