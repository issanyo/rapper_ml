[Sometimes I feel... like a motherless child]
(Yo yo guzzlin forties, let's get it on fella, no doubt)
The Walla-bee Champ comes back
Iron Man strikes back (Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks)
Raid your whole empire
No doubt!

[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]
Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Niggas getting murdered for spots and bigger dimes
Droughts and drug wars
Living by gun law
Jailcats come home and want to take yours
As a young one, growing up broke me and my peoples
Had to sell coke, I guess we all in the same boat
Think it, plus drinkin that 90-proof
Playin' on the roof sayin'
We need a next man to shoot...

[Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child...]

[Verse Two: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks
Showin off his 850 plush, with a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' forties hussled in a rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, "I Miss You" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggas peeling caps known as the Islanders
From Staten, where crazy clips be clappin
Slept in expensive gold spreads, threads made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
Cuz if he don't, these niggas with black barrels will
But, shit never calmed down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off
Money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relaxed like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin him, them niggas from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, lookin like he had a vest on
The other Pelle Pelle tucked with a firearm
Movin slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bookhead nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5G head
A King Tut piece about the size of Little Maurice
We got to get him baby, no cousin, count to ten
I'm runnin in my first instance, is they're returning
The time is now, walked in and pulled out
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Don't move don't even flinch Fix em up
Drop the head, don't want to get blood on the Tut
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbin him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Granny came out blacked down with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tut head and the cash
Granny shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast
[Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child]
Oh shit, what the fuck?
This shit is horrible
