[Intro: Serani, Raekwon]
(Huh, Huh, Huh-Huh, Huh, Remix, You know the deal yall)
Ohhh, Girl I love you, Ohhh, Aaaaa, Ohhh
It's-It's-It's Serani, Just in case you never know
Just in case you never know, Oh Oh, Aaaa ohhh

[Chorus: Serani]
Love you girl, Do you feel the same
I don't wanna play, Gaaaames
No gaaaames, Ohhh oh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby just play it straight, Straaaaight
No gaaaames, Ohhh oh

[Serani]
We've been together six months now, (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows, (Baby changed my ways)
I gave my life over to you, (And you turned around)
After all that we've been through, (I was your rebound)
Girl I want you, (All time)
I'll forever love you, (You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad, (Cause you)
Should give me one more chance

[Raekwon]
Huh, Huh, Huh-Huh, Huh, Remix, You know the deal yall
Word up, Chef Raekwon let's go
Her ass like Stewbie, Big breasts, Big S
Caught her by the Gucci shop, Stop
Let me holla, Pop my collar
All mine Prada, Everything from skis to the wallet
Paper must pile it, Style in it
Most of mine whyle in it
Shopping store all Bobby Brown in it
Ego, Foul with it, We go, I'll hit it
Now niggas hitting that peditto, Wild wizards

[Serani]
Is this the life you really want, (Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very Fun, (There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that doooor
You left your happiness
But girl I want you, (All time)
I'll forever love you, (You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad, (Cause you)
Should give me one more chance

[Chorus]

[Serani]
Cause your my one and only
I'm still here feeling lonely
Feeling twisted, Yeaa-aah, Yeaa-aah, Ohhh oh
You're my sunshine
I need you back one more time, Tiii-ime, Tiiiime, Ohh oh

[Chorus]
