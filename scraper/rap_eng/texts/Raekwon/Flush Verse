[Raekwon]
Selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Next stop: Bowling Green, bling flashing
Glow my ass off, Po-Po they try to harass
My dough - ching cash - and I sit in my dash and vent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got birds with gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather; slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster
