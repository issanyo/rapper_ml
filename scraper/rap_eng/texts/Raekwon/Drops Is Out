[Hook:]
The drops is out, the broads come out, roll the dice hear let the cops come out
Pinky ring hanging out the window like "you so crazy", bitch i'm a walking photo film me baby. [2x]

Don't compare me to these niggas, I ain't them
Since I learned at history I don't do temps
Dedicate a song to a bitch who tripped my ends

Never that I ride an mc I ain't got a benz
22's on shit look clean
It's the aura not the money give me in them cheese
For being thug at 25 I was wanted 15
38  robbing for green
School day straight weed selling at his 16
17 12 hundred on the neck just clean
18 graduated started selling Ecstasy
Had my own crib in the birds, fuck is you telling me
When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah

Pain in my life I gotta put it in flows
If I didn't I'd go crazy, drive myself off the road
I never crossed a nigga by not paying the toll
It's a price called life get closer to Christ
Yo all understand when I'm saying you definitely feel it
Can't see it with your eyes cause  is hysteric
I admit it never thought he 
Lot of bullshit today but it's joy tomorrow
Used to try to pass it by myself with
Think too much  but they ain't changed much
My  and gave up, no cheese trying to serve me
To get green, oh shucks
Remember me so wouldn't call the 

Saying Jr got guns and drugs in our home
I was  company she told on me  call
But that thing changed now's important

When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't  bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah

Yo, their  is for 91 the ratio
Still stare the devil in the space told him take that
Heavy bullshit upon my mind but I gotta live alone

If I wanna touch the gold must defeat that
Used to  which I'm Mario, and that's that
Told him I was chasin rap then the guy's stagnant
But I ain't enough said, all whole grudges to the finger, to the judges
I ain't moving or budging, I keep it real no fronting
Girl hit my phone wanna know what I'm on I tell her nothing
Damn I bug it, this is state of emergency so hit the rear button
Love kids leave your wife  like Lloyd Banks said
Plan escape with bars to get the 
I'm the head not the tail, ahead of these snails
I put my story on the beat tales

When you get money, then you fall off
Remember that shit that ain't  bitch
I'm just standing there, I'm still act nigga, aha, yeah
