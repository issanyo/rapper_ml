[Verse 1: Styles P]
Heard if you jerk off too much you probably go blind nigga
It's probably why I don't see you niggas
Tan Tims, construct joints
Caught 'em up at Hunts Point
Starting speaking Mandarin, fly when he scrambling
Always caught gambling, big bricks he handling
Started talking about all the coke and the heron
I pulled into Exxon, put my bitch Deb on
Course she caught the weapon, the female you slept on
And I don't trust homes as far as I can throw him though
Laughing and I'm joking but I'm acting like I know him though
He bust a key open and sniffed an eighth in front of me
I ain't give a fuck as long as he didn't try to fron on me
Goose bumps flowing from the alcohol consumption
We on the block working still pumping open junction
Frequently I met with his crew shit secretly
Plottin' 'cause they hate him
It's cool if they eat with me
Plus they heard about my style
They don't want beef with me

[Hook: Styles P]
Mafioso so they know I got the heat with me
Mafioso so they know I got the street with me
Mob niggas eat with me, pretty bitches sleep with me
Rough life but steet dons living easily
Mafioso so nigga you supposed to pay
Mafioso so nigga we supposed to spray
You ain't got money, see us, you can hold some yay
But you can never sleep
Nigga it's forever beef

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Brought 'em to the meat store
Chopped it with the ham hocks
Then we sent the fingers to his man and his mom's spot
Do 'em with the cow meat, said a prayer over him
Now they he halal meat, mince meat, foul feet
Do the rest to his body in Jers in Secaucus, Queens
Boulevard, the meeting, diner met in Georgia
Hit the city with the Taurus, we heard they looking for us
Them niggas know my math ain't a damn so call us
But we ready for war so hit 'em in the torso
Hittin' bosses, lieutenants and soldiers also
This is the Latin black Costra Nostra
Hit ya with the coacha coacha
Testarosa wanted poster, hood-style roller coaster
Still I hit the roach I hold the toaster with the holster

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Hey yo we smoke quarters
Fuck with some hoes, sly record 'em
We snatch 'em up, gut 'em and throw 'em back in the water
Eating only pasta kids
Mobster kids running Red Lobster shit
Yoke you from your dreads twist a rasta spliff
Hussein Bolt with a coat
Adidas on sweats sitting up in a boat
Lit it throat, my ninja's blood thirsty they won't
Be 'round you circle niggas that poke
Drop the coke
Cartels maxing in Gazelles eating scallions
[?] eat chow with Italians, more Valiums
Paying judge's Las Vegas mug shot
This is the rug spot lift and whiff you
Rinse and rip you
I'm at the table, eat your lentils

[Hook]
