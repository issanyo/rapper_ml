(Intro: Raekwon)
Yea baby
Word up man
It's all real and shit

(Verse 1: Raekwon)
She had a pretty little face
Her frame was one in a million
Jumped out the Wraith
Thats paid I need to film it
Silk on (?) girl Balli's
Going to Cali
Keep it dollar
We just got married
Honeymoon lampin' in Cancun
The kid had mad boom
Buy her bags bloom you got it
Fresh fly diva
Puff a little reefer
That deep
People today like how you got her
All game plan
Fly high level
No playing fam
I'm just that gift
Check the whip kid
Went on a chase
Runnin' like the Blues Brothers from Jakes
Thats my time
A closed case

(Hook: Sylvia Striplin)
Do you want me?
Do you want me in the way I really need you?
Do you need me?
Do you need me in the way I really want you?
Do you want me?
Do you want me in the way I really need you?
Do you need me?
Do you need me in the way I really want you?
Give me your love (repeats)

(Verse 2: Sylvia Striplin)
When I see you
Thats the time my body feels
I've got to have you
When I get you
Let me show you all the ways
I've got to show you that I love you
And it feels a little true
Don't leave this
Baby cause I'm hungry
Yes I'm hungry for the taste
Of your sweet flavor
Oh oh yah

(Hook)
