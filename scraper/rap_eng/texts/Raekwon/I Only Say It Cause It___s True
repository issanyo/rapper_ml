[Verse 1: Raekwon]
No love for crowdads, them wheels is old mags
Factory joints, I sit back in gold glasses
Count mine out on the grind, slow motion
Blunts lit, guns is big, strong noses
Drinking Don Julio, playing spades
Got my knife out, chopping through duffle bags of haze
Pack the money, talking shit, watching Netflix, vibin'
My bitch is a Grecian, four five beside me
You know the drawer full of that cocaine
10,000 square feet of lab, I live with a cold flame
Her nickname is Cashis, her ass is jurassic
Black cards, wet clit, she classy
Know we from where the drugs be flown in
It's like Medellín here, you might get left in the cold wind
Bloodline is gangster, you niggas is wanksters
We kill for real, keep it moving and drink piss

[Hook: Classified]
I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
’Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it ’cause it's true

[Verse 2: Classified]
Don't care whose eyes are on me, I'll air all my dirty laundry
I try to keep it classy, they try to say it's raunchy
They call me bald honky, eye brows like Sean Connery
But either way I get that thumbs up like Fonzie
All the way across seas, to the Long Beach palm trees
To the New York concrete, there ain't a place beyond reach
I planted seeds and my crop finally started sproutin'
I learn the art of rap, you learn the art of chokin'
You'll never see this artist frozen like the Arctic Ocean
With every [?] I've spoken, I put my heart and soul in
I'm too intelligent to say you fin to dumb it down
They tryna shut me up but every show I shut it down
How's that work, I go all out, I'm all in
In the jungle, late night, burning my stripes, diggin my claws in
I'm a tiger that's been brought up in a lion's den
But I'm still a product of my environment

[Hook: Classified]
I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
’Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it ’cause it's true

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
They said D12 was a joke until we reached a million
Did it two more times, they sick we in the building
Can't stop momentum, no matter what you'll be kill 'em
Love to ODB, D12 is for the children
Can't knock ’cause Kuniva's only speaking the doctrine
From the prophet's point of view that'll only strengthen your conscience
Still enjoy when the bad chicks in my boxers
And hit the king off with some monster, that is proper
Can't snap out of my ghetto ways
A product of my environment, Fords and Chevrolets
And still manage to get caught up where the metal sprays
Cemetery where cold bodies and rose petals lay
It's all the same, worldwide, so the Henny gets swallowed
Back with the chaser, holler back with your paper
That's the only way they gonna hear ya, better yet, fear ya
Real recognize real and class is looking real familiar

[Hook: Classified]
I could never hate a man for being himself
I wish you nothing but the best in sickness and health
Through the battles and the travels and everything else
I call it how I see it, yeah, best believe I always say it
’Cause it's true
No need to sugar coat it, we only say it ’cause it's true
