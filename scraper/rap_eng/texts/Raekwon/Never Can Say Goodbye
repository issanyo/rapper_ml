[Intro]
Light up, light up, light up
I got this, chill

[Verse 1]
Ay yo, cooling
Ankle bracelets on in the matrix
High-powered rifle on the block in them spaceships
Meet my girl Pearl, a fiend with a face-lift
Throw me 76 dime, Chef you stay crisp
Ordering steaks at Tads, a young bucket, it's plaid
Got me rimming while I'm bagging up halves
And my Mother was in gangs back then, kinda strange back then
Strictly fair ones, the game got grim
Cousins slanging chiba, uncles is drunk, aunts is wild
Old folks crowd around, sniffing blow in the clouds
I'm going off now, tell me why
I'm selling work in the town now, is it so
I wanna let you know
Cause if it was real you would've been right there
To see the whole team rallied up and going to wear
Just a fly 'partment near Canal, just like Mr. Chow
Chinese gangsters there; they don't give a fuck
Eating duck staring at us, nigga's pulling pistols out
Let em know yo, we know what we wearing wild
Now we friends wow, checking the Benz out
Take the back room in style, you could fuck in there
Yeah sixteen, smelling my piss
More money, yo we warriors so don't get it twisted
This the real yo, tell me why
It started out in the field yo, is it so
I wanna let you know

[Hook x2]
My testimony is real, a day like that
Never can say goodbye girl
Never can say goodbye yo
Never let you go girl
No no no, no no no, no no no, no no

[Verse 2]
Ay yo classy, big chains the jewelry was nasty
Real fly, official, no fugazi, fly tissue
Dressed to kill, we Hill, now walk through the mill
Better rock cluttered pockets, can you jump in the wells
Crack business, plus stack business, equals gat business
Cause everybody smell when your mack whistles
Big bear minks and long-johns, links and long bombers
Half-moon Caesars and more ganja
The bars from yesterday
Got me thinking excel through life
Get glow through the bester-years
Tell me why
I'm gonna let you know, is it so

[Hook x2]
