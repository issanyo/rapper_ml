[Skit: Unknown man]
Yo, what up D? Huh?
You bought that from Tower Records?
What's that, let me see that bag
Get the fuck off, get the fuck off it
Come here man, what the fuck I...(banging)
Like that nigga, give me that man
You dead on this purple tape nigga you dead on that
Fuck outta here (gun cock)

[Intro: Raekwon]
Niggas think I can't sell five million? Y'all niggas is mad
Y'all must not know the work I put in on this
For real, that's for real for real (ha ha)
Represent, flick it up all day nigga, Immobilarity
Y'all know my work, this category is raw

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Aiyo slash your position, verbal mic physician
Blow lines like chimes in the kitchen
God Cer-Vega, straight up stomp that fake out
What, he biting everything, biting his nuts
We slang like champions, caught me in the outlet in Hamptons
Style it out, throwin four thousand out
Swimsuit mammal get high, float flammable
Drop off in a Benz boat lampable
Rear like hittin a deer
Playin Cuban Linx movin in the chair, he got a ear
No question all brolic guerillas stand up
Whoever large throw a hand up, throw a grand up
Let's like multiply connect both sides, big shit low rides glide
Everybody bump once
Yo Chef gonna throw ya'll niggas free lunch
Hit the L twice, need it once
Track be yelling like a whore, like a swelling on a sore
Or this rap Magellion on your jaw
I'm a night freak, boating on the weekends, ten a week
Flows spray it like Clinique, rich unique
Bitch you weak, contact Reek
We callin up Leek, yo he famous like Ali feet
Yo mystical,  rap Larry Davis with a pistol
And this you, you a student, fucking with a principal

[Hook x2: Raekwon]
Rollin like ten at a time, begin
Love revolves around a thin line, go against this, send mine
Lace you chase you down, let a hundred rounds race you
Now you went from brolic to a facial

[Verse 2]
Yo, ayo glass tree house
Yo, fiendin like a fuck in a green house
Rush and cut, chain cream out
Blow steam out
Rare like guccis in ears
Goose bears
Skied up, loving all my deustch years
Coat for broadway
Hundred and 39th all day
Got my chick rollin call her Parle'
20th century max like jail penitentiary
Nikki Barnes gon' lynch me
What, fruit flavored nikes
Benz 2000 the hype piece
Send half my love out to white peeps
Wu-Tang emblem, success, make a nigga tremble
Nine of us stand, nine resemble
Filling out tax reports
Look live up in Guess shorts
Bitches got love and support
Yo, leather jacket, yellow
Leather hat, mack it real mellow
New York state of mind, crime Othello
Wild zoo of bitches, burrow that's Staten
Yo we actin, Wud up we do that crack thing captain
Still camaflouge jackets
Mad rackets
Out yo we cap shit, picture that nigga mashin

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo,aiyo blowin more reason
For a season, wud up shortie jaw season
Baltimore hall bleeding
Take money, remember that ?dun gottori? son
Dripped out in Bahamas all bummy
Gain you out patriot
Portrait of my love mad shit
Now we with things, the long gray shit
Luke bitches in Barook
Cute big, fat bitches with Luke
Lex you need boots that switches
Flights over Iraq
Ironing my hat out, and 'lax
Connecting with diplomat cats
Harlem hustle connect, Iceberg varsity check
Rimmin well ice drool off my dick
Abe Lincoln president suites, lay eventually
Pinch me, I bought head from Monica Lewinsky
Arrest that hoodlum
Strong arm that the white gooden
Faggot nigga frontin, knew he wouldn't
Flexible impact rhymin professional
We staked out eatin all side vegetables
Prosperity rhymes, lines
Casians and Asians
Let's blaze niggas with the shine

[Hook]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Yeah word up, that's right ha ha
Ya'll be loving my shit, yea all the real niggas
Stand up, hey yo let me speak, let me speak
Yo this a new year right here
It's the 2 with the 3 zeros, hear me?
It's gonna get technical for real
Let's play the game right
It's jus a friendly game of baseball
Ha feel me? Hey yo Santanna, yo
Bring that suitcase in here kid
Let's count that, where it came from?
Where it came from? Rollin' like ten at a time...
