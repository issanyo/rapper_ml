[Intro: Leo Napier & Raekwon]
Oooh
Oh yeah, oh (yeah)
Talk to me, yo
Let's hit it

Silently, I'm going tip toe around you
Silently, I walk past your mama's door
Silently, only trick my absent father
Talk to me as you walked on out the door

Violently, I spent my youth routinely
Violently, innocence was torn away
Violently, I suppressed all I was feelin'
Finally, men took me away

[Chorus: Leo Napier & Raekwon]
I've been steppin' lightly through it all
Ever hearin' anybody's call, yeah (that's real)
I've been steppin' lightly through it all (keep it moving family)
Never hearing anybody's call, yeah (that shit is official)
All I got to say (they need some food, love)

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I got you kid
Yo, nothin' to lose, mentality is beastly
Raised amongst the most ferocious, life wasn't easy
Slingin' them stones, bangin' 'em close 'cuz nobody cares
Neither did I 'cause my father left me to fry
In this hell of a world with stray bullets to snipe you
Generals look for soldiers with heart so they can stripe you
Dirty dope fiends that's evil, they got the needle twitch
Veins are polluted (?) dozin' off of that fix
Matilda' nephew Lovell, he turned states on this kingpin kid
A couple of months back
She ain't seen him since
I guess he caught a bad deal
He grew up to follow the code
But once that code is broken
That's the end
Good riddance
Them killers, they came and lynched him
They stopped his cash flow
No ifs and or buts, gotta go
He got what he deserved
If it was me I would have clipped his whole family, understand me?
(That's real son)

[Chorus: Leo Napier & Raekwon]
I've been steppin' lightly through it all
Never hearin' anybody's call, yeah (that's real)
I've been steppin' lightly through it all, yeah (smooth as one lane)
Never hearing anybody's call, yeah

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ey yo Chef, what's up my nigga?
Life is a hussle, the struggle is all real
When there's nothin' in the kitchen to eat you gotta kill
Am I wrong for that? My family gotta eat by any means
Which means if I got a spray this machine
And body-bag somthin'
Toe-tag somethin'
Creep thru the hood silently
And spaz on 'em, without a warning
It's like that, my rank is official
Pearl-handed pistols
I'm serious business
And strictly, who got an issue?
I need that duffle bag action
So I could transform the poverty ways into the main attraction
But yo, life will throw you all kinds of situations
It's a full time job tryin' to dodge incarceration
Blow somethin' heavy, keep my thoughts circulating
'Cause what I'm contemplating, is really premeditated redrum
Don't blame my for my actions, blame my environment
That I'm a product of owning my ?
?
My innocence was snatched early
So fear don't live here
All I got is my word and pride
And who swallow that for nothin'?
So take it in blood, end of discussion
Trust me
