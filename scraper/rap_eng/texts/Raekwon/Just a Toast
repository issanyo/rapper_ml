[Intro: Raekwon]
They're serving that exotic shit, man
(Mark Henry)
Word up

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
We drink Courvoisier exclusive
Kill off the snitches, fuck all fly bitches
Jump in the coupe, let your chicken yell
Throw her head out the moon
Go ahead and look mama, see how it feels
I know the feds clustered up flexin', drivin', importin'
Insurance is killing the gangsta when you work four mils in office
Being the luck stud bad bitch in tux
She know me from the maxima era, she bought the what
Automatic stainless good fella
That ain't my main bitch, who ride around angry, the same shit
Coast through the world like chess, niggas is blessed up
Yes yes, I'm at my best, boy rest
Powerful when giving coke out
You know they call me Sugar Ray The Chef, the GOAT's out
Giving good-boy gifts to the gangstas
With more points than unicorns
They know his dough is oz's out
Riding at maximum speed, give me weed give me cheese
I like cheddar of V-neck leather
Diana gold, two boxes centuries, yeah
Mention me, you better say that nigga is better, what?
Twilight up with the highlights, the wolf's out
Black fur, black spur, bitches is purred out
You know I'm flexing and my character strong
I could bag your bitch then float through Milan

[Verse 2: JD Era]
I am killing them softly, pillow over the face flow
Them youngins let it off for them pesos
They used to cut off the hot water and cable
Now I'm standing with the garb out to bring Ms to the table
What your life like? Mine's is real
We used to have to rob and steal
We cook, cook whatever for a bit of a meal
Yeah, they don't wanna see us win how I'm beginning to feel
But still I stand firm, posted up
They say knowledge is power, I soak it up
Kush pounds came here we broke it up
I said good morning to Toronto and woke it up
Wake up, bitch I'm here, it ain't a secret
My third eye twitching, the way I peeped it
A G's incense when the weed lit
And keep the white girls moving like the peach pit
That's some deep shit, I do it for my dawgs like I breed pits
Cream polo, matching clean kits
College rings got a nigga feeling like a genius
Paranoid of the lights when they flashing
Cash out big, money cashing, flow's everlasting
Swag like my passion is fashion
I'm on, no lights, camera, action, Era
