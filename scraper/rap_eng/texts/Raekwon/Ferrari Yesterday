Ima wear the shit I bought yesterday drive the cars that come out next year
Ima turn up so hard on these bitches talking bout shit next year
Everyday is a hustler day sunday through sunday
Sold 2 straps on tuesday getting geeked up since monday
That's yesterday maybe day before I don’t know
Hit the club turn up every day only off on christmas like it's a mary day
Christmas night i'm on the stage rapping shit bout shit from yesterday
Reader another city streets been with me since yesteryear they love me cause i'm one a them

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I pull on up you with my chevy smelling realest
You try to play me ima have to pull the triggers
I got them keys and i ain't talking bout no limits
And no i never trust em cause they might just catch me slipping
I done been up since yesterday
Fucked your bitch yesterday
Spent a rack like yesterday i got it right back yesterday
I swear tomorrow ain't promised thank the Lord i made it through yesterday
I done been through all them hard times i'm just trying to see better days
Hey i got your bitch up in the crib you know she naked
I told that bitch go get my money in a second
The way that she be on her knees she need a blessing
I gotta get that money back and no I don't regret it

[Chorus]
