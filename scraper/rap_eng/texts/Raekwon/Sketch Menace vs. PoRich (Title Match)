[Round 1: PoRich]
This pretender dies if he don't surrender what is mine
Besides, you wouldn't be here if Bender never took a dive
Then you hide away in Calgary setting up battles for everyone else
But didn't make one fucking match for yourself
Dude it's a chain, not a chastity belt
Funny how your buddy left and your stock drastically fell
What? Hollohan got locked so you couldn't ask him for help?
He says he's your ghost writer, that's probably true
Cause up close that chain looks gawdy/God-y on you
You ducked Jon Storm in New York, well you have to be an amateur
Just cause you got crushed by American's in Calgary
So there's no way you hold down this battle shit for Canada
And you ain't battled in seven months, that's practically a year
We all thought you retired, we actually cheered
Walked in all excited, I'm like, "Relax, relax, he's here."
Seven months, wow, how lazy are you?
But the fans are great, why you wanna play them for fools?
What? Is this the only league band you loot?
Well fuck off, this is a thousand bucks I'm raising for Q
And he couldn't even do a promo match, those take no effort at all
Shit, isn't that why your lazy ass started getting involved?
Organik, your king lame, coke head only good for throwing dust in the airs, he's King James
Here's the facts I'll tell 'em straight
I've never seen any footage of you rapping on a stage
No freestyle battle footage with your name
Never seen a cipher where Zachary was great
Shit your rap career as of late and the one outside of King Of The Dot are exactly the same
Seven months!?
I bet your larynx goes through so much atrophy it breaks
I'm eviscerating this vulture
I'll battle in Calgary tomorrow if you can freestyle right now
And start articulating an offer
Come on, it's the easiest pay to participate in the culture
But wait, maybe you been in the studio, producing something tight
I haven't heard a single song yet, well at least you're doing one thing right
January 21st, bitch save the date
Seven months? That must be your hibernation wait

[Round 1: Sketch Menace]
I said yo!
So if you asking if I wanna clash with Po', the answers "no"
But fuck it, I figured it's better to battle but realistically this shouldn't count as another win on my record
I mean I beat you the first time with minimal effort
So you thinking you're better is just making the king laugh
So at best Rich is a jester
Yo, the fans are asking me, "Sketch, what would you beef with this guy for?"
I tell 'em the titles like a video game, defeat it and you'll start feeling quite bored
And have nothing left to do but go back and start beating your high score
Like seriously guys, I'm feeling like my path is going backwards
Like Lush, for my next battle in the states
I want a second crack at [?]
See I don't know what you see in him, dude's lame
I'll leave you scheming for loose change
While I walk away this evening with a G and a new chain
But see you hope for this rematch since you choked against me back in '09
And both times, all you're throwing is weak jabs
Relying on shock value, going for cheap laughs
So it's like you got sober and relapsed because now you're going to get smashed
Hey Organik, remember when the cops attacked you?
Well take a load off and relax, cause now you got a front row seat to watch the Po' get it's beats back
So no matter which way you wanna view this
I ain't about to lose Rich
And I'ma make this picture clear for you like 1080 resolution
See I'm not able to compute exactly how you came to the conclusion
Of how you deserved this battle to begin with
And most would label that delusion
See according to the chain of evolution
You'd think I'd go up in ranks
But this is strange and just confusing
Nah, wait it's fucking stupid and I'ma take it out on you
This war was waged for retribution
See he blames his last loss to me on his choke
Well I'm sick of hearing you bitch and whine
How about this time, you just try and not forget your rhymes
So step aside you're getting left behind
You're coming out of pocket and getting booked for your offensive lines
And running for safety now that you've switched to the defensive side
I already murdered you once two years ago what makes you think I won't dead this guy?
You can call me Michael Vick, I'm here to get Rich for the second time

[Round 2: PoRich]
After I win tonight I'll be bumping my chest
But tears filled your eyes when that chain was hung on your neck
And you looked to the sky like, "R.I.P. Bruce B, I love you to death."
Well Bruce was in Heaven like, "Shut up Sketch!"
Jesus taps him on the shoulder, "Bruce, isn't he your best friend?"
"Pppst. Dude, that's Jeff's friend."
Look, I'ma try and be straight with you, the guy hated you
He died to get away from you
Rest in peace though, respect to dude and we all mourn him
But if he was your friend, I'm guessing he died of boredom
I mean Christ Sketch, you're just so dull!
Not even MindBender loves you and he loves us all
You test Richard now the uproar is coming
And what you lack in charisma you make up for in nothing
No one is getting hype when this guy's talking
Jeepers, you seen them peepers and still nothing you said was eye popping
Hey, you ever wonder if sleeping pills would help?
They used make up to make Heath Ledger just creepy and he killed himself
'Po is a savage beast, feel the jagged piece of the dragon's teeth
World Domination, it was sad to see
You crying from the sidelines like, "Battle me Pat. Battle me!"
That will never happen, it's called reality Zack, reality
You asked for Dizaster; no
Illmaculate; no
You lucky you got a rematch with 'Po
And I remember the Alamo
Nah, I'ma fucking pop him Nucky Thompson
Set prices on your bars like Al Capone
He caught his girl wearing that chain
She screamed, "Take it off slut!"
[?] by his face like "We never know when Pat Stay might pop up."
And now she keeps it locked in a safety deposit box
With a cup of my sperm and she's been waiting to top it off
So I tap her on the head like morse code to let the whore know
She's 'bout to take a Peter North load
But you love The Saurus so
You pretend it's a Peter Morris load, gross

[Round 2: Sketch Menace]
So Whitby is the city?
Like really Rich? I feel like you're just giving me ammo
Cause from what I can tell it's full of hicks dragging their knuckles like some primitive mammals
I've never been there I'm just judging by the people you bring to your battles
So watch me leave Whitby in shambles
Fuck that town where you live
I'ma let you sink to the bottom while you're bound by your wrists
Cause if you want to be the captain you're going down with the ship
See you got no fans unless- outside of your home city
So you got no talent you're worthless
Always yelling but what you're saying has no actual purpose
They'll be all loud cause they're drunk now and react to your bullshit
But online they'll laugh at you and skip through half of your verses
They'll go home and watch it and be like, "THAT was the verdict?
That's not the way that I remember it happened in person."
See the fact of the matter is you distract 'em you use it as a diversion
You're watching this square with no bars like the theatrical version
See I'm just scratching the surface cause your last battle just proved
You claimed to be an alcoholic but can barely handle a brew
So if you drank a bottle of rum you'd fucking swallow your tongue
You're just a little guy reaching for the top of his lungs
You belong in the My Father Touched Me Anonymous Club
Cause the way that you rap reminds me of the prodigal son
See I bet your daddy accosted you behind the house with your sister
And made you kneel young/Neil Young while you were Down By The River
And to cope with it now you drink and pass out from the liquor
Acting loud on the streets and running your mouth like a wigger
But there ain't no drinking involved when I laid the smack down on Richard
And throw shots at your fucking body and beat the black out your liver
See he's got a drinking problem that needs resolving
Before you can start talking shit to me
To be honest, what has Rich accomplished?
It must be exhausting getting beat so often
You've had the most loses in the league
L's to Chedda, Twist and Soul Khan, hell even one of those loses is from me
So Organik set this match up knowing I'd body you in three
He's an enabler
Getting this pathetic drunk another shot he doesn't need

[Round 3: RichPo]
You saying Witby ain't a city, it's a town that's weak
Just wait 'til we run a train on your bitch 125,000 deep
When that bell ding, I'm Mr. Belding
Zack thought he was top brass now he's getting stripped for welding
You're Calgary's division rep
Every battle you throw you suck American dick without even breaking a sweat
Fucking up plane tickets, border arrangements, let me save you the stress
Use Canadian rappers, you be flying out Americans and breaking a sweat
Don't you have a brain in your head? Or is it you couldn't battle Loe Pesci and became him instead?
And what's so fresh about using company money to buy Organik birthday trips to host your event?
I'm surprised you haven't been fired from the business
Sketch is wasting paper, the irony's delicious
Organik said, "Look, I'll introduce the dope MC's as long as you don't stand close to me."
But you had to be seen, you're King Of The Dot's best dresser
I'm joking, Sketch you wear Sketchers
What? Thought we wouldn't notice?
Sorry fat face, snack cakes won't make you a hostess/Hostess
I can fill my bars up with some of your most embarrassing moments
Like you [?] fucking rappers with a hand over your heart
Or the kid who tried to honor the memory of Bruce B and you wouldn't let him pour out his brewski
And I thought you two were close so that one confused me
Or what about the time you tried to give Real Deal the fist bump...and didn't give up?
Seriously dude, 20 seconds went by and you kept your wrist up
Or what about naming his event 'Frostbite'
Please examine that statement
He's saying his division is cold, decaying and needs amputation
Enough bullshit, the Toronto crowd wanted fire and I'm like Leaf's goal tending; monster rhymer/Reimer
I'll leave your knees smashed with a pipe
Put you in a wheelchair, you'll do the cat daddy for life
You suck at rap, I got a whole bag of tricks
So it ain't just for laughs when I gag ya bitch
And on some real shit, who would you rather have a beer with?
But if you picked Sketch then I say to you in all seriousness
I drank all the beer in the fridge

[Round 3: Sketch Menace]
See I'm about to put an end to all your hopes and aspirations
You blew your only chance to hold the chain, I guess your little shoulders just can't take it
So don't brag about the road you had to take to get here cause I don't have the patience
Especially since a coat tail was your mode of transportation
See you're a bargaining chip, without a partner you're shit
You're begging for scraps that way you're all over/Oliver Twist
Like you gotta be kidding, this economy's shit
And ironically still nobody wants to be rich/Rich
So your only claim to fame is in 2 on 2's so this is open and shut
Cause on your own it's been tough Rich since both your partners left you've been on the road to destruct
All by your lonesome trying to cope but you ain't consoling in us
Your battles are like keg stands, to succeed you need a partner there holding you up
But since you teamed with Diaz it seems your persona's gone to shit
Digging deep for angles about how a girl jacked Illmac' and left him hoping for a lift
But a minute later, somehow won that battle, took all his doe and then you split
Proving he's a two time champ at getting his money fucking stolen by a bitch
And while we're on the topic, what the fuck you dissing Drake for?
Do you know who you're throwing shots at?
He's taking business trips, banging bitches, signing million dollar contracts
While you're convincing Witby not to listen to his podcast
So you think your little comments gonna bother him like the cost of his living's gonna drop fast
Like without you, he'd be back in Scarborough begging Bishop for his watch back
You need to think before you talk and now you're getting crushed
You should've acted like Drake's boy and fucking kept it on the hush
Cause he was watching from the top while y'all were dropping accapellas
So when you dissed him in your interview you sounded awfully undeveloped
So I can see The Bitch In Yoo it's Common to be jealous
And fuck all that bullshit you said about Real Deal
Face it Rich that's lame
Him and the rest of Pittsburgh should fucking lynch you for giving Pirates a bad name
So let me thank y'all for tuning in to watch this scrawny fag get beat
You can watch it on his next episode of Bars it'll be the Body Bag Of The Week
