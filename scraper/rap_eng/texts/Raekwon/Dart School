[Intro: Raekwon]
Don't open that fucking safe, nigga
Yo, lord, yo, nigga what up
All this shit right here, turn that shit down, nigga
This school is the hardest school, B, what Dart School?
You know how to get a taste, man, calm down, man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
So much colors on my ice, freeze the ghetto man
Me and my microphone knifed up in the Meadowlands
Skinny chain on, family, that's thirty grand
Dirty crown in position, yeah, worthy man
Bezels is like metals, nigga, hold the Phantom
Convertible roof, hard headed, angry amber
If I'm pitching, giving bricks out to baby Rambo
I'm on Rodeo with yae yo, fifty baby hammers
The new shits that blow a building up, crazy damage
If it's priors, I do my own dirt, spray the cameras
So many soldiers, no soft niggas in the slammers
We run wild like 'lo gazelles and baby pandas
Small nigga with his gun rum, crazy gamblers
I'm uptown fronting, the fans know what gave me grammers
So when it's over I'mma fly to my lady mansion
And get riced up, some Japanese baby salmon

[Hook: Raekwon]
Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins
Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Back and dogging this mic, give me my gwop, homey
I rhyme for under the stairs niggas who hate phonies
Keep it funky, I got to, it's kings only
Timberlands, hard denims, rings only
Rock a big ass gun, when you come from me
Your president of your country, yelling 'big dummy'
Chef a fly ass nigga, he cook every Sunday
He had a beef on the runway, making shit ugly
I had on alligators clarks, camouflage rugby
Bad bitch from Brazil, who fuck, never suck me
We was cooling in the Trump section, throwing bubbly
Got my niggas with the guns out, bowling lovely
When it's on, you gon' remember, ooh, you made him hungry
Top three of the east, nigga, well what, what, B
Pay for that mil, for real, max comfy
Or you'll be one of them niggas that say "son me"

[Hook]
Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins
Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash
Guillotines, wolverines, fly assassins
