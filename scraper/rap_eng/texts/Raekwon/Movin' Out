Yo, ayo
Yo, select meat, Gucci sneaker recipe light up the Nestle
Bless me es-pecially, play where Vettes be seen a
Green Beemer, lightin cheeba
Side swipe Adina dressed like a liter style off the meter
Play towards regulate laws with heavyweight broads
Don't jock niggas who floss, money ain't yours
Jealous of yourself, watermelon tellin herself
Rather fuck around with a felon, more love smellin
Fendi bag high-Willie in Jag, gorilla Mag
Blow you out the back, throw your broke ass in the gap
Analyze see it like that, felt you love be it like that
Still, I'm realer than the illest on wax
Rockin brims that hang low, frames sweeter than a mango
Flame actin like a lame though, how your game go
Fine, exercise mind play the train yo
Aiyyo you dead on the chain, now watch my name blow

[Mya]
I'll be movin' on
So far from where you are
Should I let you know the code
Cause you wasn't what you seemed
And now I'm wishin on all the rainbows
That I see
That someday you'll regret what you
Done to me
And I never thought you would hurt me boy
But now I know
That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast
Through the door, uh-huh

I think it's time for us to break up, ba-by
We should of never ever been together
You tried to play me but baby I had enough
So I'll be, movin' up

[Noreaga]
You are leaving, on the next plane
And movin' on cause things ain't just the same
How could you do that, when Nore lace the smooth track
And I'm the one that gave Stella Her Groove Back
The two mack, you see my peoples playin the cut
We thugged out, you know the ones that, say What What
So don't you, need a thug girl, get with a thug pearl
Shorty say I keep em wet like Waterworld
I'm kind of busy doin MTV
So call me later y'all I think I'm the C-P-T, or
Polly with Mya, in D.C
Doin Calypso, It's All About Me, so ask Sisqo
And "Don't Let It Go To Your Head," now
N.O.R.E., I'm still good in the bed now
And we can break up, move on and don't make up
The last kiss or none of that, like a running back
Got a little cheeba so what? I got tons of that
Noreaga, you know the underground ThunderCat

[Mya]
Shit be real in here, shit be real in here
Uh-uh, shit be real in here, shit be real in here

Boy I'm movin' on
So far from where you are
Should I let you know the code
Cause you wasn't what you seemed
And now I'm wishin on all the rainbows
That I see
That someday you'll regret what you
Done to me
And I never thought you would hurt me boy
But now I know
That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast
Through the door, uh-huh

[Noreaga]
I keep it live like a grid wire, you know I ain't a liar
N.O.R.E., Raekwon and Lady Mya
Star collab' it, the wire just grab it
And if you see me with shorty, yo I'm stabbin it

[Raekwon]
Yo Nor' we used to bump like fly newlyweds, get drunk
Fuck and bump beds, rock dumps together, ice on her hand
Broadway Junction the function, Union Square there
You follow me, for a year before you had hair
Actin like you got me on mack, you wack
I shoulda blowed it off, kept that ass flat
Mya blow the track

[Mya]
I'll be movin' on
So far from where you are
Should I let you know the code
Cause you wasn't what you seemed

Boy I'm movin' on
So far from where you are...
