[Verse: Raekwon]
Yo, I'm gonna roll some trees up and think about life
Grab a wife, make her queen, throw a baby in her spleen, get right
Write a cheque, be a team, stay one, who give a fuck when they come
Blow her right, pay out and get aight
Cheque writers this goes for you, check the vet writers
All 40'ing up, we respect biters
Drinking on dead cash and coins and goons of rap
That's when I come through with fly heads and Nikes on a track
I'm a track nigga attacking a track, strictly rap nigga
Piece of the A, my South niggas track niggas, dead niggas
All the above, we love [?]
Y'all niggas stay paid and ask me for shit
We just a far little caked up, baked up, a thumb up
Plunge ya, pluck ya lady up, backshop, we run jump blunts up
Doing our thing, I'm [?] down
With a couple round on me, homie feel my style out
