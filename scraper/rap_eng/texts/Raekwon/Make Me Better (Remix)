[Intro: (Fab & Ne-Yo) Ne-Yo {Raekwon}]
(Timbo) {Whatup lord?} hey (Ne-Yo) say what
(Loso) {Raekwon The Chef, Ice Water Inc}

[Hook: Ne-Yo w/Raekwon ad-libs]
I'm a movement by myself (Oh)
But I'm a force when were together
Mami I'm good all by myself (Oh)
But baby you, you make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better
(You make me better) You make me better

[Raekwon]
Yo I'm Shallah Raekwon, my mami call me Chef
My lens dimmed up, there's chromes on the s
I keep her iced out, she flooded with baguettes
This princess cut's only for my princess
Why why why, cuz when I get up inside her
Yeah yeah yeah, she hiting notes like Mariah
Uh uh uh uh, you know we on fire
Drop top rovers, baby we burn it up

[Fabolous (with Ne-Yo)]
The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
Shorty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like me it's that man's problem
(And and and) And when I feel like I'm tired
(Ma ma ma) Mami takin me higher
(I I I I) I'm on fire
(But but but) But shorty we burn it up

[Hook]

[Ne-Yo (Raekwon)]
Cause on the side of every great man (this shit is crazy right here)
You could find a woman like a soldier holdin him down (this the remix, whatup)

[Raekwon]
Cheflon don, shorty is a diva
She settin off alarms cuz shorty's off the meter
Whenever I was wrong, she always bought me reefer
And known to keep me calm, thats just the way I breed her
Yeah yeah yeah, and when we gget into problems

Pop pop pop pop pop, if it's drama
What what what, then nigga we burn it up

[Hook]
