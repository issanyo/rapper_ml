[Intro: Raekwon]
Yup
Get this flow together nigga
Get that flow sounding ridiculous you heard
You heard
For real
Check the flow

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Glass shoe tape
Wristband kick slaying cub cop a pair
Mind blown bricks laying whats foreign
Grew up on stick ups
The whole click robbed know we ain't starving yes
Pulling out big notes yes
Jumping in the big S I'm fresh
All about success let's flex
From the rip get checks what's next
Hit grass get a pass that stress
I remain non-lame I'm blessed
Pull the nine I'm firing yes
Cause my mind knows best
Catch me in the shop
Buying a bitch out
Flying in a Lear
I'm right in the bitch mouth
Heard I'm in the chair
Louie the bitch out
Its all real yeah
You heard it from his mouth

[Bridge: Raekwon]
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Crown broken down, freaks want a thousand
Let me stroke 'em down
One bite, one town
Send siblings, hustling is business
Tustling niggas up, stomp 'em in Tims
Meet my hounds
Sitting on plainsclothes
Bitch calm down
All I rock's Kangols
Six all brown
Inside mangos
Getting it hold the town niggas got a rainbow
Everyday motto, seek for pay day
All in the lotto, Sheep's could sued grey
Out in the Cabos eating steak plates
Whatever it do, Keep the same traits
Jeeps with name plates, Sweep the main gates
Try the blunts yo they fixed with green flakes
Living up top, let's rock with team faith
And get money nigga pop I need space

[Bridge: Raekwon]
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
You hear me
