[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Money like Floyd, and swagger like Puff
That's what's up
You fuck with them big girls? yup
Had ghostface "all i got is you" on
I knew i had to move on
This light, red-bone bitch, it grew on me
I know you're rich, few kids, live in the cliffs
All i see is fly gear, and hourly spiffs
Thats what it is
Clean brim, louies was thin
Glasses on, she mastered niggas, [?]
At the crib, i'm at [?] cooking
Then came the neglig√©e, Rae stop looking
Left on the stove yo, came over, slammer was rock
She threw it in her mouth, good looking out
Chill for a sec, my real boo, yo, smooth as a [?]
That's why i buy her more shit, [?]
This my nigga, long time gangsta
[?]

[verse]
You don't have to lie to me
You can cry to me
You're the only one i let see this side of me
So give me your heart
This is my promise
For you
Ask what i'll be when i'm older

[b-section]
And i'll be your man
And you'll be my woman
And you'll understand
We could be open

[hook]
You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me
Girl, if it's too much

[verse]
You don't have to hide from me
I know its frightening
It's clear as day, but it still feels like night to me
So give me your heart
Baby, i'll light it
For you
Ask what you'll see when it's over

[b-section]
And you'll see a man
And i'll see my woman
You'll understand
We could be open

[hook 2x]
You can cry to me
When we're making love
You can cry to me
Girl, if it's too much
