[Chorus: Raekwon]
What makes a man a man, when his life is at stake
And it's real, cuz it's gotta get it's plates
What kind of life we live, one of those lives
We take cover and, cover your kids
How far your gun can reach, it can reach as far
As you want it, that's when a round'll release
The power is the move in the streets
Yeah, take my bread, yo take this lead, yeah, a nigga got it

[Raekwon]
Yo, how the semi automat' 'em, leave 'em flat up on the poster
I'm trying to push everything, from jets to the blow stuff
Yo, get it right, pa, I slang cosa nostra
I move around these 52 states, we just post up
I got niggas'll that ride, and if the cops pull up
Just splash the drain and run, we just blow stuff
I'm not playing, pa, no, it's not a game
I'mma bang, them 10 sharp pointy things through your coconut
We dodge prison, got lawyers for that
Holdings knots up through riddle shit, you know it's a rap
Need I remind you, so many killas on my line, too
We can form an army, get money and rhymes
That's the breaks when it come to just getting papes
No remorse, violate, we just take up the source
I'm the Montana, with long hammers, the strong arm of the city
It's just promotion on cameras

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Yo, we been the life of killas, ever since we was born
First got on, we blast on gorillas
Been taught from babies to bust three eighties, the skies just blaze
Then come back, with your head in a jar
My peoples is the most important part, yeah, take us apart
Annihilate, fiends scrapping, we hating these czars
Lions in the mountains, wolves in the hood
With four pounders, how dare you lounge in the park
It's ill how we setting standards, to let them cannoms slam you
It's all strictly, pardon your art
Yeah, the general's path to blow, I'm up laughing
You fucked up, send 'em back, this the city of God
It's all about holding houses, make men out of mouses
Then drape little niggas with thousands
We strive to build, the lives is real
Eyes to kill, it's all about getting acres and marksmen

[Chorus]
