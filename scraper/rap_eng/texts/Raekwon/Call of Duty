[Hook: Akon]
This is a renegade salute, yeah we on that
And keep what we kill, yeah we on that
We never fightin’ we just cock and go click clack
Turn that ass ‘round, bring it all back
Know you see me
I know you see me
I know you see me

[Bridge: Akon]
Everybody call me the top driver
Run it down to the end of the drive line
This is a callout, callout, callout
Are you ready for the massacre?
Somebody throwing down, down, down, down
Sirens blaring, but they can’t help you now
Sirens, can’t help you now

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Murder by numbers in Monaco
Me all fresh to death, big white thing go kinda slow
Got my elites in the suites, my stones is roughed up
Camouflage pants, my gold cheek
When we go, yo, we go together
Whatever is said, it’s still combat boots on the door
Still get a million a week, got the lions in the yard
Barbeque and breadsticks and chic
Fly generals, international, rational raps
Who kill like ten percent of these rats
My team thumpin’ in the crunches
We fucks with the hard, not anything else just hard

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Tiger claw scar on his neck, rockin’ links
Mad Bull PTS riles and minks
Soldiers and gorillas fall fast in the paint
Protect the projects, intersections, and inks
You still prove gooses are we mooses?
Ears and eyes, mad jury on that blare like acoustics
Kill, kill, kill, kill, yeah more, while she's dying to feel
Soldier ceremony, we gon' go with horses
Nobody dying tonight, cause I said so
More gold chariots, fly back, we fly home
Sit back blinded in the cabin, General Bang
Hundred medals on his chest, neck and stab him

[Hook + Bridge: Akon]

[Outro: Akon]
(Revolutionary) What is it like to be helpless?
When you're laying there hungry, yeah
Feel the pain and you're half dead
Not a game, no contest
And no matter how strong you are
Thought that you could be
You listen to me (hey)

[Hook: Akon]
