[Intro: Raekwon & Termanology]
Yo
When you gonna stop playin' games with God?
Uh huh, right
Take the Lord serious
Back against the wall again, right?

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Leather gloves, god
Miniature macs and snubs, god
Hit piff in the glass tub, god
Jar full of ganja
Two pyrexes rep, god
Whip, cargo,the jet, god
Coast of swaggin' niggas
We the reason that coke prices dropped
I had to stop overchargin' niggas
They cake cakey and be flakey
Them niggas get trapped now
Payout time'll get you clapped down
Fire escape shooters, hoodrat boosters
This is Mogul rap, who got the juice, kid?
Or the source, resourceful niggas done lost
Heads knocked off, swamped you, yeah, they slept in a Porsche
Ain't tryna' be no tough guy, not no bluff guy
I'm just a rub guy, the fuckin' slug fly
And this is all for the paper, baby
Silverbacks who stay max and lay the gravy

[Chorus: Termanology]
Passport Kings flex all around the globe
Hand, wrist, neck like a pot of gold
Silk robes and minks like the O.G.s
Thirty-six O-Zs, baby, that's a whole key
Passport Kings flex all around the globe
Hand, wrist, neck like a pot of gold
Silk robes and minks like the O.G.s
Thirty-six O-Zs, baby, that's a whole key

[Verse 2: Termanology]
Uh, thirty-six hollow tips and a dirty blip
Thirty-six diamonds in my ring knockin' 36 Chambers all in the whip while I burn the piff
Thirty-six O's I could whip, that's a dirty brick we chop
Yo, old ladies call him Diablo
Hunnid guns on the premises like Pablo
Go and throw it in the pot, watch the rock flow
We don't praise them false gods, we praise Chapo
Amenities like Kennedys or Genovese
I'll merrily drink the blood of my enemies
Like Grenadine, my recipe is from Medell√≠n
Louis XV, respectfully, I'm a better king
Chillin' with salt and starin' at these hideous sculptures
On my arm, see the prettiest vultures
Thousand dollar bullets with etched names
Now my connect changed
So much white look like the X-Games

[Chorus: Termanology]
Passport Kings flex all around the globe
Hand, wrist, neck like a pot of gold
Silk robes and minks like the O.G.s
Thirty-six O-Zs, baby, that's a whole key
Passport Kings flex all around the globe
Hand, wrist, neck like a pot of gold
Silk robes and minks like the O.G.s
Thirty-six O-Zs, baby, that's a whole key
