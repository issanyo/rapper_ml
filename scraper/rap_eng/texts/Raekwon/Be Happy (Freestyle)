[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, yeah, just dropped that Lost Jewelry too, man
Go get that bag over there, it's right over there
Good, good, good - go ahead
Get at it, got get it - you'd better get that
Cool…
Yeah, we good (you know we good)
Yeah, I feel that right there, yeah, yeah, yeah (that's real, right there)
Come on, Chef - milk this shit, man
I'm right here, come on, man
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen (ladies and gentlemen)
Welcome to this…
This that real, the real - let's go, man
Ayo, ayo…

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Liquor all in his… he ready to fuck somethin'
Up in the Bentley truck rollin' a blunt, stuntin'
The trainers right there is a G
Had the neck game for free, sweats on, Rolex for me
I like the sex… cause, give 'em jaw suggestions
Drunk in a penthouse with drawers on, excellent
Listenin' to Commodores, blue magic, holdin' a new clapper
I shot the masseuse, who tappin' her?
A whole lot of character, check out the big man
Jewellery game hardheaded, check it in this land
I got the seeds with me, plead with me
Don't wanna catch no bodies, don't dis me, believe in me
Up in the Ritz high as Hell
Kicks cost twenty-seven hundred, them shits came with bells
I'm more flash than the president
So ether your favorite rapper - he can wear the suit while I black up
At last meet the greatest, his clique Canadians
Look around, yo, and keep debating, huh?
Money bags, we rock the certified
Word from the murder guys who don't fuck around but burglarize
Tax bracket is ill, shout out thankfully
I've got a fish tank that's spanky, thank for me
Hundred floors up, the doors, it ain't no key
Put your finger on the angle and blink to me
Yeah, relay, he in concernt, holding' it down, sir
That's Wu in the flesh, he a monster

[Verse 2]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know?
When it's time, time to let go...
Sing...

[Hook]
All I really want is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Verse 3]
I ask for the sign from the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me
Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
If I give you one more try
To there rules, will you abide
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe that we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah...

[Verse 4]
Life is too short to be tryin' to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind?
All the time...
Help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, just help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Yeah...
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I don't wanna have to worry about nothin' no more
Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be
Said I wanna be, if it's alright with you
I mean, it'll be alright with me
Won't you help me sing? Just help me sing, yeah…
