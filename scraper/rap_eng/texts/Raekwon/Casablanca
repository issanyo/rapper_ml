[Intro]
Stop touching the fucking door man
You so fucking paranoid man
What's the matter with you man?
It's like a nigga could write for hours
And get real theatrical wit' this
Understand? Telling you kid
I got stripes when it comes to this right here
Y'all know my repertoire
It's dangerous, and the cats I roll with is dangerous
And they ain't your regular average cats
Here we go

[Verse 1]
A-yo; It's all elegance
He spoke third power style high intelligence
A young man handle the game like Merrill Lynch
3 A.M. breathing, leaning in gates
I mean creaming
Selling these cakes in slabs like Land O' Lakes
Fiends beaming, steaming
Associated with names and demons
All apparent reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year
Sort of like time share where crime, sport it like I shine yeah
Rainbow dough was the M.O
So many flavors yo
Buy your neighbor off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked selling tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Vacheron Constantin - nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot with a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass laying like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renaissance Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumping
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it broke the money down
What's the total count it, no count it over
In the mix day going slower
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me
Not being a crook, count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him with the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wilding
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen
Yo wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right
Envelope came hype
Regards from the mayor you hype
Fuck right, lets fuck this money up
And get large and blow outta sight

[Chorus] (x2)
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
Who you gon' choose - me or him? - you a fool
Pay attention, fuck around meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen

[Outro]
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
... you a fool
Pay attention, fuck around meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen
Wise niggas wake up
