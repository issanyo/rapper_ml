[Verse 1: Raekwon]
From shooters in buildings to coupes in the pavilions
Play wealth, keep your health and your heart first
The belt that's been passed on the last car collision and cracks
We was there rolling up, holding duffle bags, that's facts
Blood on his Fila's, [?] Levi's
Laid there, two chains on, where's the throne
I was slick, like poets who know his shit, cold as shit
Thugs that stay loaded then blow throughout the global quick
Fast money and sneakers, cool out king silks on
Right in front of the Flash Gordon, you crabs goners
Stealin' styles so we taxed him out on Billy Childs
The bodies was ripped from water, twist the chalice
A grown folks game to the older folks
Grey haired gangsters rockin' New Balance
See the chodes, a few challenges
Money spill, heads tumble, thugs rumble, drugs crumble
But still I'm still upon in bankers trust, thankin' us
Preparing my speech, pulled up in a peach Corniche
Seats are burgundy, soccer gear and Louis cleats
Hand me my medals, Pussy he just laughin' at us
I know you wanted my bitch, but money won't attract it
They trained, pullin' pistols see the aims
It's desert shark, that blow apart flesh and bones when it starts
The originator, cuban linx chains, diamonds and Clark's
Swim on this crime wave where bags of money get washed

[Chorus]
They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels
Word from the wise, it's time to rise and show and prove

[Verse 2]
Getting money is easy, keeping it that's the hard part
Creeps and scavengers roam the land, call 'em aardvarks
Go ahead and try me now, filthy rich Africans
From the slums' glorious days, I bring the action in
Long hair Brazilians love swallowing my childrens
Self made poet, poetry constantly bringin' millions in
Scratch that small talk, meetings with the higher ups
Walls necessary, cemetery bitch and bury chumps
Spark [a branch] and sip the champagne for the pain
Let's celebrate, this duffel bag snatch your dime piece bag another coffin though
From the era where the code is 'never trust a hoe'
My advanced stride is the coldest, yo
Ritual's get the bread and stay upon your square
For the leeches and the sly foxes please be aware
'Cause they will pray upon your shortcomings
Jeopardize the family's heir
Here's the first glass, sip it to hell, I'll see you there

[Chorus]
They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels
Word from the wise, it's time to rise and show 'em proof
