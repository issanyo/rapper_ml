[Intro: Raekwon (Masta Killa)]
MoÃ«t got me acting like a fucking goat in here
Yo god, remember back in the days god?
When we came a long way and shit, man (no question)
We supposed to be blessing each other
On our physical days and shit, you know what I'm saying?
It's like basically, I wanna hit my family with like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dun

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stacking paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we running John Dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cause it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up
Do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she taking you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wising up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred - the other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status
Salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, your moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum ready to haunt something
Takes something of yours, here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watching how the big niggas rolling wit big cream
Big schemes
Quick to flash your gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be saying "Let em breathe"
The others wanna deceive
How we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We starting showing our asses, committing burglaries
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wondering how the sword talk, did he fall off?
Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinning on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sitting back on a better note, yelling "Peace god
I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable"
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good
Won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood, ha ha

[Interlude: Masta Killa]
I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, know what I mean?

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen
To a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While traveling the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind
Never ended we now send it long winded
Descended infital, Bobby Digital
Abbot of the Shaolin 'Isle
With knowledge and wisdom
Of the original sword style begin
Birth of the Wu-Tang Clan
