[Intro: Raekwon]
Straight up, c'mon Bub, I need you dun
Yo, Straight up y'all
Yo Ghost I love you man
You know how we do this right here
We do this for our family
See you soon kid

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
The greatest thing a kid could have
To chill with his family, sit back laying on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, "get the fuck out"
Couldn't understand it, feelings turning to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growing up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Getting drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop crying Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be immaculate
Taught by the best, remember stress
A ghetto agenda that's how we rest
Don't let 'em play with your emotions
Lotioning me, little money in my vest
Damn, Mom going through it, still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up, yo
Yeah when Granddaddy died, I know you didn't see me cry
Held it in, it hurted Ma a lot
Remember, Bucs had me in a tux
Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut
Yeah, loving you always
Screaming on janitors in hallways "It's my son" always
Caught me in the crib yo, smoking
Sat me down heart broken
Hoping the phase had me open yo
You like, hey yo, for real
You like loving you for life it's only right
Strong yourself we make it
Weak minded you naked
The pain and hurt I can't take it
Plus my Uncle in jail, that's your brother go see him
He look forward to it like mail
You my ace, you the lady in the place
You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place
Trust me I'm gonna work hard
Tattoo my body, throw it on top where I got scars

[Break: Reakwon]
See it son, start crying

[Outro: Big Bub]
