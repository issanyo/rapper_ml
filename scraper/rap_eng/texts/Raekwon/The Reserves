[Intro: Sample]
"Dear, this is most inconvenient. Now I'll have to call out the reserves."

[Hook 2X: Raekwon]
Aiyo, drugs from Philippines, guns and guillotines
Murder land triflers in the hood with killa genes
Car hard jumpers and seeds is gold robers and them cheebas
Fresh off the block, note the leeches

[N.O.R.E.]
Aiyo, machine gun rap, Maybach floor mats
Panel door suicidal, you see my rivals
Keep the sour puss face, I keep the kush case
Phillies unravel, Earth smoke spending with me
Afghanistan headband, that straight sticky
Empty pillow cases with the soda and the soap in them
With my Indian niggas that only sling opium
It's Shallah, my Chinese dudes, take they Shahada
In sweatshops, cutting them things from Guatemala
My rosary beads is blessed, came from the mountains
Used to sell dust juice, water like a fountain
I meditate in a room full of rich rugs
Stretch coke like yoga, deep like Yoda
My chronic is green they call it Shrek like ogre
Militainment, Icewater, water that freezes
Them hand to hand on the block with them pieces

[Hook 2X]

[Capone]
Check this military regime, mafia, guns from Czechoslovakia
We eating bread getting stockier
Army apparel, draped in the Vatican, you rocking that last year
The bulletproof vessels is cashmere
Burning in a hostler, or toast ya
The east coast go Cosa Nostra, heart cold as Nova Scotia
Ramble like Che Guevara, I ran the Reagan era
Word to mama, now I smoke Obama in a grey Carrera
That's presidential kush, blowing outta bongs that fiber glass
Seventeen thirty eight Remy
The semi hold bullets that size of a little penny
Block stars, not a rock star rocking my jeans skinny
For parole violating fugitives on a run, son
Live by the gun, son, die by a dumb dumb
It's not where you at, it's where you come from
Laundry mat travel wash money by the lump sum, get it

[Hook 2X]
