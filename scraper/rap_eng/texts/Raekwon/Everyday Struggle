Ya, ya, ya, come on, man!
Keep it moving, man, this ain't real efficient shit, man
You know what I'm saying?
I mean chill out man
Chill out my old girl, name Faith, hey, what's up?
Know what time it is, man?
Did ye shit all day, man?
Word up, man!
What a fucking role is that?

It's funny how the world just turns around
Everything that goes up, just know that it might be coming down
And nothing new under the sun
Everything's already been done
Listen to the words of this song!
If you're coming from the right place you could never go wrong
Life can just pass you by
So I just keep my head to the sky

[Chorus:]
Well, we got to figure out
How to just broke it out
Nothing's more precious than time!
I'll tell you what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!

Let me tell you something unknown!
You gotta be more careful of the things that you wish for!
Just like king Minos, I was told!
Just like king Minos, I was told!
Everything that glitters and glows
And if you really know how God works
Damn, she's mean...
Anything is possible
But you've got to just put Him first!
He holds the world in his hands
I'll understand if someone explains

[Chorus]
Come on, we got to figure out
How to just work it out!
We got to figure out...
Nothing's more precious than time!
Nothing is more precious than time!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!

Work it out, work it out!

You know the struggle is on maintain
Refuse to go back between...

Most of the ground made me define
But every time we're in, we're lost
To keep the love be, open your heart!
I invested in well and their success is as special as hell
To many black clouds broke out the day I caught myself I smoked out
Wish I had a moment to sell!
A moment to sell...
A moment to be what you wanna
Me I'm just a genius of...
That's what's real, makes us confront it
My stand my personality, this is my reality
Keep it moving you can do it!
From the... and I've been borne to...
Try to stay rich in the heart, stay strong
Stay strong...
It really makes me repeat it

Peace repeated!

What we've got to figure out
How to just work it out!
Nothing's more precious than time!
Nothing is more precious than time!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind to get to the right!
Open your mind to get to the right!
And you've got to figure out, how to just break it out
Nothing's more precious than time!
Cause the world just turns around!
I'll tell what life's about, people gotta work it out!
Open your mind! Open your mind!
To get to the right! To get to the right!
You can get to the right way

It's just a hobby that I've picked
Nothing that I'll need
Word up! Everything is will!
... fame
This is their meaningless...
Love protects everyone!
