[Intro]

Yea yea, What up my nigga, thats nineteen hundred dollars
I need to see you alright
Yea, lets do that, for real

[Verse 1: Raekwon]

Buyin' Le Perle, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vuittons, coup ya Benz up
Keep it one thousand trooper [?] hold ya ends
Me God, despicable me, just a typical G
See everythings a goal, shop, cop, and flee
Up in Finland, thats class gremlins with millions
Thats why I stay luxuried up
Waves and Timberlands, best lover girlfriend
Me romantic thats the antic
Who fuck up in helicopters now land it
Wardrobe remarkable, pen game arsenal
Up in [?], they got showers here, park it boo
You been a rider rollin, hair up in rollers'
Yo thats my shoulder, you can keep it, I'll mold ya
Black sand beaches, Norwegian I'm treatin'
Four Seasons or The Ritz peep the keys
See the waiters, they suckin' us
Shake that ass, thats a  teaser
Stay bowlegged thats a pleaser

[Chorus: Faith Evans]

I remember the way, you used to love me
I remember the days, you used to love me

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Faith Evans]
I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away

[Chorus]

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

[Chorus]

You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day
Now your love has gone away
I remember I remember

[Chorus]
