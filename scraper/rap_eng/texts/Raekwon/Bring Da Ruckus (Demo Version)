[Intro: RZA]
Bring da bring da muthafucking ruckus
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me
Forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some?

[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave the microphone hanging
Bust this, I'm kicking like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on

[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

[Verse 4: GZA]
Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back
Giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wetting CREAM I ain't wetting fame
Who selling gain I'm giving out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin ruckus

[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

[Outro: RZA]
Yea, Wu-Tang production, kid
Straight from the 35 Chambers
The Inspectah Deck-sta, Raekwon the Chef
And the RZA-RZA-Ra'
Shout out to my man RNS, Big Mook and Divine
Mr. Hezekiah, Due Lilz, the Ghostface Killah
Ason Unique, yeah, Gka-Gka-Genius
Give it raw, bring da mothafuckin ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan (bring da mothafuckin ruckus)
