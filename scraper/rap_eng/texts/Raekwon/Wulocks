[Verse 1:]
He in a wheelchair moving like Xavier
His arms is crossed he had a haunted power moves in Arabia
Glassware chemist cocaine riding with vengeance
Crib elevator 13 benzs, 7 snipers 64 rifles that might pull
He chuckles work is the thick glass I chose
Less road is the Lex luga load
Give him the Globe take his 19 shots and go
Nego Mallanna him and his brother don't fuck with us
Shot up Lacy's crib his ass is all dusted up
Goofy niggas get slapped perfectly
Bring all yo goons I got 2 lurches will merk your best man
Styrofoam nozzles drug boys come with them hallows we wulocks
Warlord models New York the home of the brave
You'll get your face caved in you sell out y'all niggas is slaves

[Chorus:]
Ayo big city corruption high life train heights
Plane flights war stay more games and gunfights
Bad company city streets and living comfortably
Big dreams live it up till them boys come for me
Big city corruption high life train heights
Plane flights war stay more games and gunfights
Bad company city streets and living comfortably
Big dreams live it up till them boys come for me

[Verse 2:]
Got goons ready to ride ready to die
And not fooling round to kill yo they will comply
Sports fly like the fourth of July
Bullets fly but his fortress is fortified he will survived
He ain't got that through his conflict and combat
Mercenary assassins celebrating contracts
Black water the body count is enormous
Remorseless eliminate all informants
Engage in war kick down the door hit the floor
Warlords like African sworn rebel forces
Sparked revolutions with shootings that they doing
And they moving as a unit through these dark days
Sparks plays in his bloodshed
Blood red sunset the world is left upset
When you shot you not thinking that you have
Mula, new ammunition new shots

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ayo big dreams live em up rogue chains and leather gloves
Rottweilers wilding off the dope fiend and powdered drugs
Ma seargantist got them choppers and chopper rick
To watch his children with choppers and click shots full of hollow tips
Lock the city down crack communist
Black conglomerate moving through this metropolis
Rocking gold [?] with diamond-crusted iron glyphs
Bring the shooters through call it third world politics
Rootless gorilla warfare in the suites
Standing like a super villain on the roof
With a Luga and a bad German Bitch holding the loot
She a killer with a mask and a ass to match a murderer's pursuit
And I never ever ever have to dust off the metal
Cause ma lessons won't let it settle
Swinging power like a Brewed street over lord
Birth from out the bowels of the ghetto
Screaming loud from a pedal stool a thousand of truth

[Chorus]

[Outro music]
