[P.U.R.E]
Yeah; Majestic, marvelous, mind over matter more
My murderous militant mutilate millions
Monsters with the most masculine muscle
Maxing in a major way, munching making more moves maintainin’

[Raekwon]
Multimillion dollar mansions manufactured [?] mud
Through this metropolis
Millimeters are met with the mufflers
My method is meditative musical medicine
With sergeant mentality mechanisms

[P.U.R.E]
I’m medicated materials methane meet the master massive
Y’all monkeys no match, make a mistake and get mauled by this mamba
Movin’ with the mobsters of Molotov
When I mingle in a midnight, moments are muggy

[Raekwon]
Mossberg, mind ya motion
Get molded in the morgue
Your mouth is muted, mockin’ my music
Got your wife mutilized, bank account minimized
The most malicious, ‘membered for meltin’ mics be my mission

[Chorus: P.U.R.E]
We millimeter speakers, M&N, back to back rap, relax
You featherweight cats can catch this
P.U.R.E one electric, we fine like coke that stretch quick
So aggressive, we got now, fuck who the next is

[Raekwon, P.U.R.E]
Narcotics, narcos, negotiate this nice diss
Nah, never that’s a negative, it’s nonnegotiable
Nemesis they need to fill the Nas
Nonchalant narrators
Navigatin’ niggas are nauseous, bro
Because they numerals are nathin’, none, nada
Nefertiti women neutralizing our nectar, they so naughty
Advise y’all nerves to be neutral, all of that nonsense
Should kick us not no wedding living off the land with no mans
Nah, level nostalgic, we notable, notice the nozzles
These nuclear nose brothers are nonsensical
Nuisance is not a necessity
We necessary, we the new nickel mans so just ask Nancy
Nominated and so notorious
Get ya neck broke for ya numbnut
Negligence your life is numbered
Highly respected, ninety-nine attributes
Now you know who’s recognized as the Nobles
Peace to Nova Scotia

[Chorus: P.U.R.E]
We millimeter speakers, M&N, back to back rap, relax
You featherweight cats can catch this
P.U.R.E one electric, we fine like coke that stretch quick
So aggressive, we got now
Fuck who the next is
