"oh yeah yeah yeah "
"i'm gonna thank you"

[Raekwon]
Yes man
Fuck that
Yeah
Yeah
Hey yo
Hey yo
I smoke on the mic
Like smoking Joe Fraser
Holding a blunt with a scope
And blaze shit up
Much more harder to those
We like barbers and hoes
Flow is like
Hard shit
Yeah
I'm unstoppable the rhyme is hollow tip
Throws while i post it
We gotta hit
While i take shots at
Chat Fiend
Its like selling poison
Upside inside the mind
Nigga anything Raek says goes
Limp Bizkit shit
Mix together
You are convinced
It's frozen
When the hit store
Mix together metal and rap
Can't you do better than that
At one of our shoes
But on the other hand we like you
Don't bring your clan or band
We fight you
You might get a gunshot
Rock and rap ready to rock
Putting more on the map

[Fred Durst]
I terrorize with these eyes
All you players on the sidelines
Get victimized
Ain't no mamma on this planet
Who won't cry
When you see the baby boy sucking thumb and
Licking crumbs from their eyes
Switch on the blade
Pay the price pull the pin
What this hand grenade splash
I think i warned you again
Take another route
Devils waiting for the handshake
Better sell me
Cuz i'm gonna lead you to the gate
Unforgivable
Got shot
You invisible
Typical
Ridiculed
Motherfuckin' pitiful
You don't know the half of these bitches im going through
Bullet proof
Pull a tooth
Spiting juice
Take a shot
Naked absolute
When i'm through
You is through
Speaking all that i know is true
Blowing through this revenue
Something you can never do

[Raekwon]
I all I want
Maxin' in the wind
Sweeties that match the black bed
Stay relax in a black tent
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds
Soldiers get so blunted
Flex and drop bombs code wanted
I all I want
Maxin' in the wind
Sweeties that match the black bed
Stay relax in a black tent
Roll runners gunners that throw hundreds
Soldiers get so blunted
Flex and drop bombs code wanted

[Fred Durst]
Oh!
Got you haters feeling like we do
Oh!
Got you feeling like we want you to
Oh!
Got you haters feeling like we do
Oh!
Go you feeling like we want you to
You got that right
Raekwon on the show
Limp Bizkit 2021
Mathematics on the beat
I could listen to this all night
All day
Everyday
Just rewind it
