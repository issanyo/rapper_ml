You want a Rolls Royce
You don't come here
No, no
You go to England
That's wherever the fuck they make it
If you want champagne
You go see the French
If you need money
You find a Jew
But
If you want dirt
Or scum buried under a rock somewhere
Or some secret nobody wants anybody to know about
There's only one place to go
Right here
