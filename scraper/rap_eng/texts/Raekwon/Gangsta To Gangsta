[Intro: DJ FatFingaz]
Scratches

[Hook]
To be here, we pay the cost thats why we here
With that said raise your glass in the air chea
All for one, and one for all
Gangsta to gangsta, worldwide salute to all
(X2)


[Verse 1: ToasT]
Daily routine, mind and the body at equal balance
Knowing the body follow the mind just like a savage
Out to advance in my path chasing this cabbage
With a neccesary meaning for being ain’t hard to manage
Avoid being plastic in the fire, never melt down
Mental armor, the horror is being one of you clowns
Take a piss and sit in position, your hearts missing
We taking chances getting it cracking in moms kitchen
Supply and demand as far as your money allows
Circle small ducking pitfalls, and folding out
Large tables, breaking bread, kamikaze chambord
Queens get the royal feedings, whores treated like whores
[?] Transition to this position, came back from moving treys
No wait up, skipping to get my cake up
One in air for all my niggas on the wake up

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Out in Houston in a astro van, Nigga a castro fan
Baking soda famous for my guns in abundance fam
Neck brace with diamonds in it
Ride around with lions crying ready to kill, they need a red steak
Sharks who surround water, or up in vegas
Blowing a quarter, neck glazing in the blazer
Kill for my daughter, thats a code
Now gone and crack it, I’m up in the leaf jacket packing
16 shots in the slammer, ready to get lit
My integrity is the shit
Even through all the hostility i’m still here
Hip hop loves you, a hip hop dedication or fuck you
Nigga i’m the shit niggas know it
Glad i ain't trying to rob one of ya niggas, Get dumb on y’all
Charles Bronson with an arson, Life like Sonny Carson
Darts fly out of my cartridge

[Bridge: DJ FatFingaz & Raekwon]
Thats real nigga, You already know what it is
We do it extra extra extra ordinary
Shout out my real niggas, you know who the fuck ya niggas is
Salini Music nigga, My 1889 niggas waddup
To all my heights niggas you know what we do
Toast whats good, it’s the chef right here nigga
I got you covered, all day nigga
SUCCESS! Wassup nigga, bank commission ass nigga
Toast this shit was mean nigga, One
