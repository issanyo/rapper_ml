Read the fish, get the red lobster, tilt your glass, seen shorty ass
That's what's happenin', son, pass the hot sauce
Straight vibes, corner to corner, me and my mans glanced at her
The look, sure do prove she a woman
Yo, good morning, mamma, what you ordering, right now, some water
And it hit me, mami was a dime and a quarter
Thirty five cent, thirty five dollars or thirty five bricks
That's live, then I seen her eye and blew a kiss
[Alicia Keys]
Baby, baby, baby, from the day I saw you
I really, really wanted to catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
I must really like you
Cause not alotta guys are worth my time
Oooh baby, baby, baby, it's gettin kinna crazy
Cause you are takin' over my mind

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
And it feels like, OooOooooOOo...
You don't know my name, I swear
It feels like, OooOooooOOo...
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go
Will you ever know?

[Alicia Keys]
Oh! Baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
You doin everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imaginations runnin' wild

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
And it feels like, OooOooooOOo...
You don't know my name

Round and round and round we go

Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like... OH!

[Polite]
Yo, yo, I met you in the restaraunt, see you every wednesday
Fly little waiter, so we exchanged data
It took a while, I ain't even think you would call
You used to walk by, you once said nothing at all
I ordered a special, know that every time that I do
I ordered the chocolate, a soda, just reminds me of you
So you holla out of the blue (damn), gotta catch a flight
When I touchdown, shorty, I'mma holla at you

[Alicia Keys]
I'm doin nothn I've ever done, for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you, cause did I mention? (OH!)
You about to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have
All of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience
My lovin (OH!)
Cause my lovin' feels like...

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
OooOooooOOo...
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go (and I swear)

Round and round and round we go

[Interlude: Alicia Keys]
Well I'mma have to just gon head and call this boy
Hello? Can I speak to... to Michael? Oh, hey how you doin'
I feel kinna silly doin' this but uh, this is the waitress
From the coffee house on 39th and Lenox
You know the, one with the braids?
Yeah... well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
Look man, I mean, I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wonderin' if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?

A little different outside my work clothes
Wait, hold up my... my cell phone
Breakin up, hold up

Oh yeah... Thursday's perfect man
