[Hook: Dej Loaf] x2
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

[Verse: Raekwon]
Try me, try me, I'ma pull that flame out and start firin'
Lightin' up the cheeba, schemin' on a robbery
We gon' hit your label up, they yellin' bribery
A posse like the Isleys, the Isleys
Posin' in Ferragamo, need some Visine
All us got machetes, poke you with the Yao Ming
17 holes in your Polo [?]
Stylin' since the '90s, the '90s
Shoutin' out Japan, biggin' up my Chinese
2 S Benz's flyin', those are Siamese
Burner in the bag, Gucci sneakers lime green
Don't you ever rhyme, B, no you're not me
Blowin' heavy broccoli, my sport is hockey
Yeah we fuck bad bitches, whores jock me
Flyin' in a Porsche, doors, oh stop beefin'
