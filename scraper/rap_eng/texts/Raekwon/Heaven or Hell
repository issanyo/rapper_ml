[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, what it is man? What's going on man? Come on man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
She dissed me when she walked out the door
She kissed me, Louis luggage on the floor
Gazing, plus the room was misty
I felt a slight urge telling me to wisen up
I can't previse her, she dead in the right, the don's a jiver
I lost my most powerful piece, my queen
Broke her heart in sixty six ways for some bitches and schemes
The only thing she left was a rose, and left the Rolls in front of the building
Now how the fuck my pain get exposed, damn
What happened man?

[Verse 2: Joy Denalane]
We don come to a point where it can't be denied no more
I don't even understand what we're still in this for
I didn't mind the sacrifice to keep our love alive
But something died so long ago, just can't be revived
There comes a time you gotta face the situation and make a choice in life
We're caught up in a state of hesitation, and that just won't suffice
Don't get me wrong, I done thought this through, yeah
The way you hold me used to console me
Now all I feel is the emptiness in you

[Hook 2X: Joy Denalane w/ Raekwon ad-libs]
What do you believe in, heaven or hell?
I don't believe in heaven cus we're living in hell and that's my life
With you

[Verse 3: Joy Denalane]
Yeah, listen to me
You sing my praises everyday, you used to tell me how you needed me
I know how proud you were that day I brought home my degree
But you had dreams and all I wanted was for you to see them through
And through it all I forgot that I once had dreams too
I should have had the sense to pay attention, cause someone told me to
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and Lord knows it's true
The years that I gave, were they all in vain?
Used to adore me, now you ignore me
How could I know we would end up this way?

[Hook 2X w/ Raekwon ad-libs]

[Bridge: Joy Denalane]
What hurts me most, deep inside
Now that I'm letting go, you seem surprised
I wanted you back for oh so many years now
You used to act like you were holding your career down
It's not the dreams I kiss goodbye
It's that we used to be a team and I lived this lie
What's past is past, now listen well
I'm leaving your ass, gonna meet you in hell

[Hook 4X w/ Raekwon ad-libs]

[Outro: Raekwon (Joy Denalane)]
(That's my life) You know what I'm saying? It's all good
Word up, The Chef, you know how I go
Joy, Joy Joy, whatup, one love baby, hold it down
