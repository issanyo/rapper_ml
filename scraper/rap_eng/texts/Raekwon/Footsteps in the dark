[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Catch me in them fisherman hats, rocking cannons kid
New improved Nikes on, flying through Atlanta Kid
Lounging, piffery lit, look who we wit
Yeah Denzel, Samuel, Brett Farve, and Brad Pitt
Chilling in thou kid, 2-1 and thou and a suit case
Bet that now lets blow the blue base
Def George Clooney and his goonies, wrapped up big
Play the left table the bitch with the wig
I looked, thats my nigga
She was a crooked one, yeah thats my nigga
Shuffling cards bitches bras off niggas is card sharks
They Jakes, crooked ass hops in the mix
Yeah we posted up assassins is laughing
Niggas in yellow Bentleys ninjas in front of the building
They from Cali p's gangster, chief eats
They're known to sweet beef then break out  lay low in the Aspens

[Verse 2: The Isely Brothers]
Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

[Chorus]
I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

[Chorus]
Honey, now lets stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
And you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin' and try to be more aware

[Chorus]
Yeah, lets stop walkin' around
Well when there's love lost, lost to be found
Honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Honey, lets stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's no love to be found
Baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?
