[Intro]
My nigga give me a few dimes
Going up the block to bag the eights up

[Verse]
Congratulations young nigga now your gun game's grown
With no respect for your elders I'mma mail y'all clones
Y'all been fighting but no change came
Mami just maintain, sick lessons from Rae, we dated in Spain
Eating good foods, he's a good dude
Word to your pops, they had a beef, Rae shot him in his twat
Wisen up shorty pull up your Evisu's Weisel
You can't make a living with no knowledge, you see Juice?
White man with regals, pull up to the crib with a fucked up joint
Fly laugh get to the point, peoples
Y'all get to here what I say
I'm the invincible to y'all non-lynchable is Rae
Just give me my paper I'mma meet Shaq in Jamaica
And close down the Bally store, them bricks made me wake up
The police they swore when they catch me they would snatch me
And bury me alive with some old dough exactly
Stocks and kangos quit fucking around, don't slip
Sparking every leaf, I slang those mangos
Bag of zigs mind your business, while establish my businesses
All I get is money flying them sixes, uhh
My blood pressure off the meat rack, come to the lab check the heat rack
A few silencers, fours, my doors they swing like whores in London
Stertchpants and stripes, strangling jaws
Dick sucks on weekends, smoke cheeba in the beacon
You know my nigga Keyon and leak friend?
Slick talk this weed *inaudible*
The hardest wool legged and sheep skins
