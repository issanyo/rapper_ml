[Intro: Method Man]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Fuck you

[Chorus x2: Method Man]
What you wanna be when you grow up, you wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters, you wanna sell drugs
You wanna be gangsters
That's what silly boys are made of

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Aiyo; aiyo; Coogies and forty seven flavors, display swade gators
We coming through to blaze neighbors
Meet mark and pardon me to heat mark, a dutch spark it
Lex Leonardo arts profit
Apple cranberry mixed with Cristal, fan worry
Desert mountain crib in the ground, we arsonists
One point five a liter, take a taste, splash your heater
Smack your face twice, clap your sneakers
Shit is like a mission to Mars, fishing for bars
Taking what's ours, knowledge the car pa
Don't be stupid, get a little cash better swoop it
Throw it in the ground and recoup it
Next check was best, your family pack your shit
Get vexed, leave a nigga standing in a bag of leaves
Some niggas catch on later, try to put them on they haters
I met eighty of them niggas yo
Waiting on the sidelines drooling, some need schooling
Let me teach yo and roll a student what
Rule one: yo respect if you lose son
Don't be big back about to learn to move dunn
All hell to niggas in jails with sharks in they fishtanks
Now he come home he a whale
Wolves in the projo's, projo's yo
We realer up in my shows yo middle finger 5-0s
Take time to climb vines yo
Lay on the lines like Laury only loving Rae kind
Sun splash cash laying like three bags of hash
Fully wrapped in a Indian man's stash

[Chorus x2: Method Man]
What you wanna be when you grow up, you wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters, you wanna sell drugs
You wanna be gangsters
That's what silly boys are made of

[Verse 2: Raekwon (Method Man)]
Aiyo, get up, Lex should be bragging
Get it up, fuck shorty got cream in a mean truck
Prop-ness she holler like the Loch Ness
He large rock this, fresh Ferrari in a drop six
Fro's, yo talking about the dough on his clothes
Glaze is crushed up poking on rolls yo
Oh yeah and maybe getting cream
See what I mean black queen, stop actin' like crack fiends and
Brawl we wanna thank all of y'all
Play the wall hype checking how this lady walks stay hawking
Grab the remain, divorce, shame came to yours
We like green, rock the same game plan, ours (Yo, Yo)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Taking to the next degree
By M-E-F and the bloody Chef Boyardee
Watch out bitches is too nosey, backhand slapping the phoney
Got to walk it off can't mosey, who got you open up
Crack pipe still smoking, face frozen
Coke straw sticking out your nose and D
Proposing that you bleed on the Chef apron
My thing hold down the play-pen and say the nursery rhymes they making
Come on now, shit's too real, fuck you and now your man feel
Time don't stand still for y'all bitches
Wanna Big Ball, I got two for you to juggle in your jizzals
I'm losing it now, going to pieces like a jigsaw
Aiyo, she multi-colored like a rainbow
Mr. Meth and the Cuban Link kiddo
On tracks we connect, politic ditto, take that to that

[Chorus x2: Method Man]
What you wanna be when you grow up, you wanna be thugs
You wanna be pranksters, you wanna sell drugs
You wanna be gangsters
That's what silly boys are made of
