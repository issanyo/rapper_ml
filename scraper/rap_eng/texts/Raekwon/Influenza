[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like a nigga ain't good enough
Paint art but these niggas don't look enough
Single parent home moms ain't cook enough
Use to sell weed but I didn't push enough

I was too busy in the stu cooking up
Looking up, to the sky, like look at us
Look at Raz with the Lo' sport gear on em
He been the man for his balls had hair on em

And he see his niggas going down the wrong roads
But he can't steer for em so he say a prayer for em
Then blow smoke in the air for em in em air
Jordans these pair really rare I don't wear often

Often caught in dreams of lake shore lofting
Blowing loud green Al Green playing yo
Niggas wanna see me beneath soil and rejoice
In the recoil, as my hearts stops..
In this Game I see me on top my girl asked what
About her I said I see me on top brandish
The watch, the dot stay in me like a scatter plot
Master Plan Pac strictly for my niggas yeah

Influenza sickness lighting the Buddha you now eyeing
The Lion of Judah, every rhyme is a rugger I let my
Guess jeans hang like a booger, thats nasty
Tryna be the mansa musa of the future

Stanza's is the coolest no Santa's where we cooling
Started at the bottom and we there still trooping my
Blueprint making def jams Rick Rubin's
Invested in gold assets Mark Cuban's

..Stupid muthafuckas had me on they snooze list
Now I'm on they boo's who's who list, do this
For people who love that hip hop shit the flows back
Everyone else can suck dick you can quote that

[VERSE 2: Raekwon]
I hear you young prince gather your thoughts
Stay at course where you stay fly, get rich and blow like a horse
I heard the hood hated, your lab it was gated
Them 400 keys I sent, you graduated

Stay protected, and don't be fucking em raw
They know you got money now just cum in they jaw
And those Colombians we fuck with, them niggas my sons
The next months heroine just bring out the guns

We independent, word got back we in the pen with it 
Don't see me activated, then I'm suspended
I'm just parleying potato the mack up and braying
Hope niggas test mine I'm out for the slaying

Just keep ya dome straight fake niggas living with hate
They know who go real with it just listen to Rae
Take it from me king, speak truth its real in the clinks
Guess who put you on only built 4 Cuban Linx

[VERSE 3: Raz Fresco]
Sat back polyin fresh to the mausoleum
Chamber, Ryu kicks wit 3 vegas the 
Baker n the chef shine like Vegas 
He call me 88 cause I got that og flavour

I'm like Mussolini in a polo beanie rock the gold Linguine
Roped up poster boy of the rich porters of the
New era, theraflu games, flame sporter
Insert quarters on em dames swerve Daytona all my
Niggas in the field I feel like a slave owner
BC OG O.Z.'s better then California since a
Toddler, Cash Rules, study black mobsters

Wu Tang Clan Gambinos of the culture
Crown me, ultra, like the UV, ulcer
Sick shit, need million dollar offers cause
Two and two makes four crystal crazily poured
We slice cats hold the mic like sword
