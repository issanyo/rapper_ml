[Leatha Face]
To my hard rocks, locked in cell blocks, never shell shock
Melt the ox in your face, displaced in the penalty box
My enemies heart pumps poisonous blood, your choice, the slugs
You do dirt in the rain, than your name is mud
Major love to thugs in the back of the clubs
Strapped for what? TO avoid bein stuck and blazed up
Laced up, struck from the waste up, embraced by the muts in the cut
Bullets sizzle up, leave you fist fucked, intense cut
]From Leatha and Uey, verbal gymnast
Volvo, physical fitness, over tracks leave statistics
Tripped into the realm with chrome shines like sunlight
Half of my life is right, the other half is a gun fight
Uptight jake harassin for college satisfaction
101 question askin in back of the paddy wagon

[U-God]
Sadly, tragedy happen
Lost in captivity, imagine me happily clappin
Big barrels, heavy ammo, man the mammal
Packed in commando, rapidly practice supreno
Crack my fingers on pianos
I torture you with orchestra tackle on your back, the jackel
No time to react, combat, flyin scrap metal
Kamikaze degrees, cherry instant fire, live wire
Dunn, rock it til your knees drop, over tree tops
Collosal current enforcin, outer bridge crossin
One foot first, is the rebirth, the crime arson
Caution, furnace flyin, deserters try to black ball us
Over the face of the Earth's surface
The heat is heatin up, demon from the east wing
Hitman's bullet, leave you barely breathin and barely seein
A critically blaze, biblical plague in amaze
Riddle the box, smmothered in cops
Sky hugger, Space Jam, slam in the blizzard of rocks
A space invader, laced with lazers and with omega weapons
Magnificent 7, this cannibal mouth, gangsta spectrum
Form an animal house, fume at 11

[Chorus x2: Leatha Face - Shaolin Soldiers]
We shell shocked, we burn hotter than a meltin pot
Your skeleton drop, as your cells start to pop
We dwell on blocks, while you cats held my the cops
Blow fire from you tops, your expired by the shots
Hot wired by the watts, exterminate ya, terminate ya
War displayed by the real niggas

[Raekwon]
On his wrist saw the spiral, glass hand
Last man to eat tracks like you straight up, hit up a white dude
Jean jacket, Austrailian gats, Mediterainian raps
Play the back with the joint on his neck
Who feelin this? Thugs love this, we way above sea level, love
Check out the glove, stay bloodied up, plug this
Verbal hygiene, the Golden Arm, plus niggas stay warm
See ya out in Mexico, we implantin The Swarm
All niggas snatch money, watch the sweater, criticize my Fila
Sneakers cost cheddar, with the heat out
Brolic, extra large, dynamic, crack your ceramic in half
Go against The Grain, we feedin you math
What up? Niggas call it high-tech, big shank reign
Straight out the kitchenette, jums in the set
Before I go, analyze all money go
Yeah, you seen him, a 6 double O, rockin bummy clothes

[Hell Razah]
Bloody Red Hook, money and crooks
Get out my face with them funny looks, ya better off studyin books
Let the weed burn, they brain dead, I feed em the worms
Y'all be actin up and showin off, in needin to learn
You know the sun shines as the Earth turns
Nowadays is the ghetto germ, knockin off whoever concerned
I dip your brain in the blood of fire, prophecize like Jeremmiah
Turn a crowd to a choir, hot wired space ships
Fed niggas who I hate with, I be Apocalyspe, Tales of the Crypt
Raise the dead out the realm with a 6
Overwhelmed by the smell of the clips, gun smoke, shots hit
We surrounded by Hell and politics, bulletproof or hollow tips
I'm the silencer on the loudest clip
The widow maker, Heaven Razah, put of curse on whoever major
Snatch the belt off the heavy weighter
I be a Swarm alligator, slap niggas way across equators
When the dare try to flaunt they paper

[Chorus x1.5]
