[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Damn, your loving got me tranked out, the handkerchief out
We walk the bank route—shorty, be careful with your link out
Miss Fendi girl, Wimbledon chick who rock a stick shift
Photogenic, crazy athletic, medic, whip tinted
Using your mind, that’s the jewel of life.  Science is right
Walking the righteous path, peace, God.  Love your math
So when you’re zoning from the head start, we’re blessing your heart
Peace, I’m outta here girl.  Check out the best part

[Verse 2: Davina]
Never have I been so mystified by anyone’s love before
Hey, I feel so natural.  I keep coming back for more
And each time we touch, you open up a new door
Baby, you’re such a midnight tease, uh
It’s gonna take everything to keep you from me, hey
And the joy that your loving brings
Can separate the mountains from the sea

[Hook: Davina]
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 3: Davina]
Spent so many nights believing I was wrong for you being in my life
I can’t ignore it when some say that it ain’t right (It ain’t right)
But I decided you’re the best thing that happened in my life
I haven’t had everything, oh no
But you come close to everything that love means, hey, yeah
In Heaven’s eyes, love is embraced between you and I
Now that we have each other, I don’t have to dream

[Hook: Davina]
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so strong, it could be wrong
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Ayyo
Select me.  Gucci sneaker recipe, you know the situ’
Max for moments, bad Dobermans I hit though
Sling dot.  Between me and my wiz, chain lock
Dressed in leathers, plus we represent the same block

[Hook: Davina] (x2)
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
If loving you is so wrong, I don’t wanna go on
I don’t wanna be wrong, but it feels right
It feels good, so good, so good, so good
