[Verse 1: Knytro]
Feeling like a Tyrone Jones, barefoot on the block
Going gorilla, hip or hop out close
I'm #winning with no Charlie on me
Feeling like a cool Billy, these gates, they never close
Backstage chilling with women who kiss my hiney
At the back of the club, sipping Moet is where you'll find me
Bumping Al Green through alpines
Full of fire, toking on Cheese C99
My Cinderella high times, my, how time flies
Whenever I deny strife, live out my life
Without living a lie, like figures that I find ridiculous
My life's live, nigga, go Popeye for spinaches
I'm spinnin' kids, no stop time
We diligently killing it, OGs chillin', they feelin' it
Cause we the realest in the building, Ciroc'king luxurious
Bottles popping, I'mma Rick James, the party don't stop

[Hook: Knytro]
Gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Crow teeth, words and writing
All I know is bloodsport, Gilette-style, lyrics are slicings
Started from the bottom, now I got em
Slip us in the motion, two big bulls, my hoes riding
Water to grass, thinking 'bout cash
Buy an ass stack out, cop a couple giraffes
Yo, ranch house, twelve rooms, I play the largest, the top
Anywhere else, I'm all for my blocka
Killers with connects, specs on
Adidas' sweats, gold MAC-11s, reapers and creps
We showing, chill out, relax fully
My game plan is Ray Man, 300 million, all stacks, really
Dumb bishes, this the division
Yo, far away from prison but I'm still in the system
Can't take it? Roll out, it's like the dice
So nice, birthday cakes with bombs and they blow out

[Hook: Knytro]
