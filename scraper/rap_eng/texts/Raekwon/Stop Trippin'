[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah
We back
Now let me tell you niggas for real

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Hey yo, for real
Check it
Back of the limo blowing grass
Play the demo, broke a glass
Gazelles is crashed
Check the rim homie
Jumoed out
Hammer on me glamour
Velvet blazer, light green Brooks Bros. shirt
Pair of Stans on me
Contemplating jump in a cab or jump in the Navi
She hate me
Got caught doing threesomes in the Jag
Rolling joints (?)
No points
Nigga now you gotta go
She kicked me out of my shit yo
I said cool, no more love I gotta move
I left smooth
Punched a hole in the wall and blew
I had the Call of Duty Wrangler outside
Snakeskin skin, gold madam, black Timberland, laying down why
In a stripper warehouse in Vegas
Celebrities cater
Serenading bitches, I was just fanangling
39K a night I take it
Straight with the wraith
Take it home
Nigga I fucked up with my wife

[Verse 2: Horace Brown]
Overlooking our problems baby
Overlooking our pain
Baby lets get together
Things are not the same
We're just hurting each other over again
Two wrongs don't make it right
We find a love and then...

[Hook: Horace Brown]
Here we go again (here we go)
Stop trippin', stop trippin'
Here we go again
(x2)

[Outro: Horace Brown]
Confrontation's always guaranteed
We've always had our rainy days
Yes we did, I know we did
