[Verse 1]
I spit Lazarette get yourself to arrogant
I told them Motorola Coca Cola strolla
Use to chop coke on a gold plate
And watch my jewish friends eat off it
And yell muffle top
Don’t be destroyed destroyed just to bail
I told them those old God’s them young boy will kill
My filosophy hot as helly autobiography
Living through a prophecy jailhouse monopoly
Binoculars victorious torious is legendary
Your presence so bow when you see us
Mafia dons thick babes want to give us
Cush with the thrilla reallas strippers and the divas
You know just how i ride kid
Wedges right under my eye lids
That meaning I see sharp I
Am deep in the ocean that means I see sharks
I survived in the jungle nigga I see mountain lions

[Hook]
From my screen bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order
And bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order

[Verse 2]
I am from when they clap I’m up close
For you andrew Jack you take them MJ’s and wipe
The blood off of the napkin
New general role filled killed the arrogant arrogant
Wild fugitive Ford Harrison
Paper soldiers they loose stripes under the moonlight
Lessons we the new life sweet as a cube hice
Food for thought bees you the greese time ten
Tantranory we the three wise men
And my does stocked high you lost it as simple as I quit
For my whole self it ain’t for no target
It's the new world order money
So I monopolise use to hustle work to phene skin
Sumolly style my vision is clear just like the brunal
Back in the jungle they say I’m too wild
To go against a team like us
Like bringing a ham sandwich in the mob

[Hook]
My screen bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order
And bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order

[Verse 3]
When ya’ll niggers want to eat what’s on my plate
My day the whole machete they chopped snake
Morally miami nigga they chopped weight
Like we in south philly eating chopped stakes
What makes rain hills you know when earthquakes drop
Collateral OG because it’s our anniversary
I ride on the pirates pot no time to work play
Felt like a mother that smuggles clid on the north phase
Neck tie supreme court illegal shoe lace
Place with you beast and create a new race
You out on appearance you still lease
Want to be for the gorilla then call the beast

[Hook]
We the bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taurua
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order
And bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order

[Verse 4]
Guns in Africa wanted man in Taiwan
J cool want to sway boot on Obama
Red grey deceit colour beats
Fly bitches in Asia cooling on her man sneaks
Chunking with the hustlers then next with the credits
I master my gun men and the leather
You up in the parks while a nigga shoots
Before you tell them salute you from the male
When master of the music is like addicate
Before you get played you better choosing who is your manager
My handguns are charging come to the complex
And hang around the cons in the convent
Dice games and white planes
ESPN in the white range and bite danger
Before I cruise to Egypt I know niggers ain’t fucking with us

[Hook]
For my bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order
For my bricklaying general on the four corners
Pink  make a rabie I spit on the taura
Whole book of life its the supreme order
We the new 5% so respect the order

[Outro]
I rise stand up
Stand up
Brooklyn Bosnia you all know what we did
This is what it is
Yea mine got checked mind
Elevate my niggers work with me yeah
Orange check generals on deck
Brooklyn is Baghdad
Yea Syria Libanon
Ain't nothing changed but the game
