[Intro]
And now, ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Clay will honor us with a recitation of his classic poem "I am the Greatest"
*Bell Rings* I AM THE GREATEST!

[JD Era]
Bro I woke up this morning I looked in the mirror and you know what I said to myself? I said "You have to be great. The greatest."

[Verse 1]
I'm smoked out all day
You know it's kush you can smell it in the hallway
Ten bad bitches, you can all stay
God bless, let us all pray
New deal, new money
I spend it like I never really knew money
Can't stop gotta get the crew money
Won't stop till I got that fuck you money
I'm prime time, HD
Cool nigga, AC
Slated and you haters can't replace me
Fuck around and make me ease off safety
Hush up, I said hush up
All you sideline niggas shut the fuck up
Big ballsack put your nuts up
It's Era in this bitch, nigga what's up

[Hook â€“ Raekwon]
It's the greatest, your favorite rapper's favorite
H2O, JD Era blaze shit
Turn it up, get wasted, let's face it
No other crew could ever try to break this
It's the greatest, your favorite rapper's favorite
H2O, JD Era blaze shit
Turn it up, get wasted, let's face it
No other crew could ever try to break this
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)
The greatest (The greatest)

[Verse 2]
I want it all, crumbs too
This the Art of War nigga, Sun Tzu
Bitches want to kick it like kung fu
So if she 21 I hit her with the one two
Twenty-twenty vision, game good
Ask around the city boy my name good
New era, flame good
They knew Era like we grew up in the same hood
Late night, grey ship
Hustle like I get it on the pavement
My momma told me "Baby don't take shit"
And scared money ain't never gonna make shit
So I muscle up, double up
I send you on this trip don't fuck it up
Greatness, tell them suck it up
Beginning of the end, boy your luck is up

[Hook]
