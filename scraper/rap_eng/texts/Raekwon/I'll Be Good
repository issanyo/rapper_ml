[Intro]
Hey yo, lemme get a turkey burger. Swiss cheese on it
Give me some, some fries, sweet potato fries and shit
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
He got popped at Johnny [?],plate hit the floor, he played dead, she walked out
Fuck the nigga Rae
White leather bloody
Yo call the ambulance nigga, your wife shot you yo pa this is ugly
Pointed to the charm on his neck, took it off, "Give it to Brenda"
His old aunt, she transgender
Yo I don't know him. Police jumped out rollin
Get away, he got a boulder, sipping Coca-Cola
Officer Brown, a faggot
He killed my kin Big Case in October
Nigga started lookin, fuck you I'm booking
And bounced, threw my shick on the ground, I'm coming Brooklyn
Never been a shook one, if anything [?] I book niggas
Full time hustler, yup crook niggas
Yeah we seen what happened, young nigga thirty years old
His father was into cooking

[Verse 2: Rene & Angela]

Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

Just by chance
We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

Oh, no (Oh, no)
Love has knocked us down and scored
We've been twice around the block before
Know the changes you've been through
My promise is to you

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I fell in love so quick
I knew that this was it
So much emotion
Made so much devotion

And when we talk
We're never miles apart
Your telephone line
Is tied right to my heart

(Love me, baby)
Your love has knocked me down and scored
(Knock me out, baby)
You may hide and close your door
(Baby, baby)
Open up, I swear it's true
(What you gonna do)

I'll be good {I just wanna be good}
To you (How good)
Better than before (Mmm...)
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Will you be good, boy
{So good}, so good {Hey}
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

When we talk
We're never miles apart
Telephone line (Telephone line)
Tied straight to my heart

I fell in love so quick
I thought my mind was playin' tricks
One twist of fate
Made it somethin' so great

Let me show you how to live
Stop goin' from town to town
Don't be afraid to give
Time to settle down

When I'm good I'm bad
And when I'm bad I'm better
When I'm at my best
There's no room to guess

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mmm... ooh

I'll be good
Better than before
Know I'll love you more
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
