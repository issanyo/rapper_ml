[Verse 1: Raekwon]
The modern day, multi-rap, Penny Hardaway
Allah's way, God's day, Range in the garage way
Freak this, slap meat on this uniqueness
Relax overseas status black beat your feet to this
The grim style Role' sundial, Sun of a Man who went
Foul spent, ten thou' on jewels, 80 cent on Loud
Slang lord, applaud, forty-eight up on the board
Holding the stainless plain sword with ya name on it
Lord, burn 'em, ninety-eight degrees Celsius
Go for delf, no breaks, from stealth, crash it on the belt
Almost lost the eagle, the diamond gem I paid 30 legal
Crash the bird, cranberry regal
Stepped off, double oh-eight style
Bubble the tape out, real niggas who kill bless the weight style
The treasure map stash billions, smash a class of Sicilians
Glassy watch flooded out for trillions
A million dollar lawsuit, got paid and swayed you
And floored you flowerhead niggas lost you
What? Faggots, come up over here
We got it all and I'm the holy child of war

[Verse 2: Hell Razah]
I know niggas who carry guns like
The same way the Earth keep in sunlight
With no fight, snatch your ice, sell it in Crown Heights
We grab mics, Malcolm X type, Israelites
From the poor like, holy war type
We got your lost wife
Loving me, fuck the bubbly, it's the drugs in me
Cover me, I want his company, and all the currency
They out to live luxury, cheat and lie, die comfortably
Nautica Rugby's like Seagal Bugsy
Y'all disgust me, Nia Long sisters want me
A King David strong country, we still be hungry
Too many rap braggarts back stabbers, abracadabras
Get hit by the golden daggers (bring it!!)

[Chorus: U-God]
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in my directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Intellectual, rhyming professionals
Bring all the ladies, in our directional

[Verse 3: 60 Second Assassin]
Inevitable, fed of all rhymes, like vegetables, yo
And when I let go, the deny the oaths, amigos
Lessons be stressing the fact without question
Determining who gives who, a slap to a westman
Bugging while smuggling, lyrics cold bum-rushing
Touching your brain leaving it, left, while recovering
Tagged, by the fact they rap the daily contract
And ac-cessory the best of me flipping void and fast crack

[Verse 4: U-God]
My attitude is metal, I'm rotten to the veins
Saber-toothed tiger in the booth still remains
You see let it be let your soul feel free
And disdained with the horror from the powers that be
And it's grabbing me, jabbing me
Stabbing me, imagine me trapped
Fully packed anti, combat, gravity rap that
The A-Alike attracts and, Hunchback chills
The sinner's to gain reveal, Homicide Hill
The thunder style underground, Plymouth Rock
The loud mouth grouch in your house, Comstock
The curser, verse with the worser thirster frantic
The felony's swelling me, telling me to push the panic

[Hook: Hell Razah]
Living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels
C'mon, living in the world today
Making room for our seeds to see a brighter day
Who's to say real thug niggas don't pray
That's why we drop jewels, we drop jewels

[Outro: Hell Razah]
Cause we drop jewels
We catch it, if you don't I sit
Nothing but jewels
Living in the world today
Living in the world today
We drop jewels, we drop jewels
Locked up for 13 years
The album
Sunz of Man is out, what?
Bring it bring it
South coming, intellectual, rhyming professional
Ladies and children
Everybody facing our directional
We coming like a storm
Be in the night, everybody ask when the album gon' drop
Here it is? want this?
Sunz of Man, Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah
60 Second Assassin, Killah Priest, Raekwon, U-God
This is how we do it
You don't want it
