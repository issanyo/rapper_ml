[Raekwon]
Straight up nigga, I'm a money nigga man
You know what time it is wit me, yo
That's right
Take the track, cut the heads off, split it down the middle man
Take the bones out man for real
Yeah all apple pie yeah
Straight up, Flipmode BK king

[Ghostface Killah]
It was the best heist since ice
Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holding a navy blue Uzi
Krush Grooving waves off the atlas
Cooling, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasing
Duffel bag swollen, we holding
Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that y'all, we gangstas
Sticking all you Bay Ridge Benzes
I'm out to get erect, terrific shit be the diamond district
Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony
Gems is magnificent, diamonds is crying
"Busta Rhymes take me, never mind help!"

[Raekwon]
Hey yo caught em at the ice pavilion
Dressy, salad bar style Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick
Guessing like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beaming, faggot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck!
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tijuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in velours white designing on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backing me
Bust a shot, motored
Four male in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody
Left em all baseball'd down, brother
Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors

[Busta Rhymes]
Money! Drop dead on the floor
Nigga, pass the keys to the door
Pass me all the cash in the drawer
Or I promise you'll be payin the price
Feeling like a nigga died twice
Execute the world's greatest diamond heist
Y'all niggas know we out to get this money!
C'mon money! [Repeat: x7]
Raekwon, Ghostface, Rocky Marce c'MON!
Let's get this money nigga

[Rocky Marciano]
Yeah we ?near the mind? out west
Somewhere in Africa
The Feds is after us, vest on my back
Whipping the Acuras, feel like a mac busting
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothing
A hail storm, ice raining, mind containing
Info, nigga what you in for? Complaining
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speaking through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Kaleidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flaring gunmen
Hate to see me coming like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm hugging
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the Congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey yo we do great study on fossils and stones like archaeologists
Gemologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunking Donut precious size stones make me want to cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Planning the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwing light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed Burgundy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Round table with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talking foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, y'all niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as the Hasidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks in Keikos
Every time we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplying niggas all the platinum and shit
Money [Repeats]

Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist
Thoroughly and successfully executed
By none other than Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef
Rock Marciano and Busta Rhymes
A job well done fellas, very good piece of work
