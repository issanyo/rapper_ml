[Verse 1: Evidence]
I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed
My patience led the way 'til the greatest love listened to me
I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches
It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches
It's hard squeezing life in a sentence
And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint
My entrance is what's between
When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene
Alchemist cut the record down, to the bone
And with a record like this I take the world by storm
It's God blessed, the land of the brave
Understand where I stand, my hand is made
From B-R-double-O-K-lyn the planet
Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became
Panic on my first campaign
But when the words fell in place, I was certain to reign
I hit the purple then step in the circle and start flexin'
Weatherman invented, now storms change directions
Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now
I always shared pretty good for an only child
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on
They off welfare and got healthcare
They used to have their priorities elsewhere
I took rims and tires and traded them
For a ticket to an island, that's where I wrote this rhyme in
Where I first saw my vision written
Driven by a better living and place to raise kids in
So I think like I rule the world, on the brink of something bigger
Building schools for boys and girls
The thought alone gets me out of my bed
I said you got the tools, get them shits up out of the shed, c'mon

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I'm like the Emmitt Smith of rhymin', the Jack Dempsey emcee
All my shit customed out, hold the fort eventually
Money is made, fly blades
A woman with brains, it help a black nigga reign
My lifestyle as a prowler; a rich loner, owner
Used to pump at coffee shops, had my bitch Roselle with me rolling up
Fly ass and still classy, asking questions like
Why you wait on that glass, why would you splash me
Yo, it's only nigga shit
I'ma teach you like I was taught to
Hold the fort, walk through
Seeing all kind of grey fossils
Colossal jewels, bigger house, act fly, I got you
No need to walk backwards, fuck up the taxes
My street credibility is stronger than NASA's yeah
Yo a diplomatic winner, Nike boots
A skully good denim jean on, and one-rent em

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
They say you only live once, I disagree
You only live twice, your life and then through your seed's
So I bleed on wax and feed them the deed
So when I die they got the foundation on my publishing B
Plus the words that I speak, here's my family jewels
It ain't all blood diamonds, but life experience tools
And I be rhyming cool but my philosophy's deep
Like a Dear John letter, so read em and weep
And the wolves smell blood, you can feed em the meat
But Iâ€™m a lycan, Underworld we can meet in the street
Draw heat, but what happened to peace
He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech
Jesus, diarrheas, I mean holy shit
Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit
Communion, add the wine, make the sign of the cross
And I don't live in the past, chalk it up as a loss
Went from, please listen to my demo to stretch limo
To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel
But I can't go out like Kimbo Slice
Like Gina Corano, I'm a Cyborg we terminate
Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald, over one billion served
But it's up to me to get what I deserve
So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm
The early bird gets the worm, but the hawk gets the bird
