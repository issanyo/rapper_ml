Some still say Lex is a powerful man
He is still one of the most influential gangsters of all time
With a story so vivid and a mind so powerful
Who said gangsters couldn't be governors
And governors couldn't be gangsters
I know he's still around and we all have a little Lex in us
But until then, he will always be, the official Lex Diamond
We love you Lex

Lately you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another
