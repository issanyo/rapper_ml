[Intro]
Yo, yeah so you know, word
Them niggas got the shoes up in there son
Na na, hold on, who that over there?

[Hook: Faith Evans]
Baby I can bring the heat when it's cold outside
The one you need, baby ride or die
Anything that you can imagine
I can make it happen, only one to hold you down
A good man deserves a good woman
A good woman that'll treat you right
I'm the one to hold you down

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, come here young lady with the skin of a baby
Who dress like a Wall Street woman, you ?
I know your family, they my people for life
Had a beef behind the wall, one of your cousins, he threw me a knife
But that's yesteryears, life is intact
Been battin', quit rappin'
But I'm just reactin', your body packin'
I know not to ask a woman's age, but it's crazy these days
No time for slipups, the industry is crazy
Bloodhounds chasin' these girls
Girls chasin' these birds, they say whips we see curves
But I need one with knowledge and self
And whole word, say word
Yo hop inside the Aston, put your feet on the fur
Let's talk, put the Birkin in the back by the door
Don't put it on the floor, it's bad luck so don't fold
You've got a strong aura I'm digging this snow ?
I want a boo who gon' give me the business hittin' Guinness with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Take the keys to the lab, put your ? in the ?
Don't worry 'bout paper, that's afterlife's chapter
We good
