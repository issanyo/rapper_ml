[Intro]
You already know my style
Everything is real baby
Raekwon, all day, you already know

To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Do you hear me? Do you want more?
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
[?], Do you want more?
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Do you hear me? Do you want more?
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
[?], Do you want more?

[....] all I need

Yir, yir, yir, yir, yir yi-yi-yi-yir-yir
[....]
Slowolf!

[Hook]
Hey baby girl you just blow my mind
I like the way you hangin' on the dancefloor baby
And on the way out you just blow my mind
Keep it [...] on my dancefloor baby

You just blow my mind
I like the way you hangin' on the dancefloor baby
And on the way out you just blow my mind
Keep it up all night, dancefloor baby

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Hey yo, ey yo
My sweet little princess
Your body i could level like a benchpress
Put you under my wing, I've been blessed
[...]
The day when we met I was seventy
Running with generals making moves
Then you came in my arms
Sexy little theiver
Body like Alia
Rockin' fly sneakers, wifebeater and the [?]
All i know is [...]
I'm all like Faracom a New York
[...]
Between me and you, I'd rather be [?]
This is my queen [?]
