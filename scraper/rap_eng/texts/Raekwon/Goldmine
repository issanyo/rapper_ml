[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Old dro bottles, and blow, blowin' from both zones
Layin' in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin' the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin' no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
We got guns tucked in our waistlines with rags hangin' from our back pockets
Miraculous money, nigga, can't stop it
Sherlock Holme' Kangols
Medallions so big, attach strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal profiting, drug money
Scram rapper, my 100EX golden like a honey graham cracker
Sidewinda, niggas tryna' infiltrate, blind-side a nigga
Hit you with the 8, we in the club
Dumbin' out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop, ones out, fi'-dollas for picture with the guns out
Juggle for a couple days, close shop
Then continue to bubble until the strip hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel on my spare time
And keep niggas wit us to push our shit like George Jefferson hairline
No frill, niggas better go chill
'Fore this gun go up in your nose like coke sniffin' up your nose-stril

[Hook]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Ay yo, saluteme kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin' Fruit Loops it's all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin' niggas magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We huddle in big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them

[Busta Rhymes]
See I was always good at science, in the class I was dope
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin' the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggas for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin big to acredit (uhh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces

[Hook]
Gettin' money like back in the days
Niggas like shower posse in a spectacular drug games
Slayin' niggas, steady sprayin niggas, till the task forces'll roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin' niggas
Streched that coke and see it come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with baking soda or quinine
Strategize, gettin' paper like the Chinese, Jamaicans
And George Chain niggas, and watch me set up a Goldmine
