[Verse 1]
Parked the Red Baron Beamer in the back of the cleaners
Relaxing with an army gun Zima
Medellin is in my blow like Floyd dance
This chain I wear is skinny, baby, but the weight 80 gram
Jumping out of silent shit, rugby marathon
Peace to Rob Paragon, smoke with Aguillah
Blow is designed for the ghost
But I don't want it if it's biting the head off
Come see me slap a don
Great escape, me and that connect with the crimeys
Back when me and Flex kidnapped the 90's
I was king, call me Luther LeBron
Make a dream team appear
Court-side seats in the karmas
Known for my get-down and fly wears
Usually my eyewear that make me buy up everything bomb
I'm a old Fila king with wings on
Street sharp Nike suit
Sharpey goon-face Milan

[Hook]
We getting bread in the building
Niggas getting money
Quick to spread in the building
Get lead in the building
Bosses don't bite, they write checks
I want the nigga head in the building
Get fed in the wilderness

[Verse 2]
Ay yo, four-limb goose down to the Timbs
The gems is coke-boy money, lay in the 700 Benz
Blowing cheeba, dumping ashes
The class of last year
That'll throw your head through the glass
Forty-five, all diamonds in it
Grimies did it
Chinese killers jump out and divot
I will post in the New York Post, blueberry ghost
You'll steady motion when I'm aiming my pitch
We young niggas who die hard
Fly ride hard
Soft top, that means to push your head off
I be famous, but my bodyguard Spanglish
It's all miscellaneous, ain't nobody telling
It ain't a issue
Thick skits tapes with bombs in it
Cooler than the velvet-grown pool
And the pussy embalmed with it
Yeah, Buddha texture's cashmere
I beat your man up, drop five hundred, and blow and smash gears

[Hook]
