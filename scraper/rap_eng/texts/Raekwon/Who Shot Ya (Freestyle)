[Intro]
No that nigag didn’t come out of a motherfuckin’ balloon in the air
That nigga’s ill, he landed on the projects with that shit
Crazy, B, crazy
Ah man, it’s this nigga Rae right here, right
Yeah, 2013 bullets, huh?
That’s what I’m talkin’ about
Real

[Verse]
Fly down to Vegas and fuck, drop a half a ‘mil
Table it up, silks cable it up
I’m from the grain, entertainers get scooped and trapped
Pull a navy blue Uzi out and roof your ‘Lac
Crap table, King, Black Jack, gangsters with chains on
69 blue jean denims, OJs on
Relax, blunt’s on me, black weed gritty
Parlay with the wrangler posse in the city, yo
Overdose confidence, gun in the console, concord jet to the Congos
Bagging everything up, swag on a million, blindfold
Can’t see nothing I wear, fronting out here
They ask me how I’m eating, I be hunting out here, yeah
Godzilla rap and them labels
Hugh blow fiend, heron don, Levis is plainclothes
So many rings plus surrounded by kings
Sitting back in the fourth row, examining Queens
They like “Chef, yo, you built for it meet at the Biltmore”
Any violations I agree to get killed for it
Where’s the real rap? Niggas is lost now
Hmm, how much it cost now to marry it up?
Divorce it, blaow, extortion style
Shoot the first nigga who talk, you lost your style
My next album might be called The Wild
Wolverines, bears and whales, no snails
Foxes, good Great Danes, that’s all, he Cale
Kill all the rats, for real
They live in the hoods
They all come out convinced to sell
Little clothes niggas is frail
‘Cause when he rap it’s like poisonous lines that’s rich
Mix together virgin blood and gallons of piss, yo
The real lowdown in the midst
I come like Sandy in the middle of the year like Christmas
Kango, Santa skully, emerald green
Rockin’ dark green Wallabies, blowing the beam
On the go, yo, bowling for cream
And I’ll be here for the next ten years for the team

[Outro]
Yo, oh shit
Pacquiao just got knocked the fuck out by Marquez, nigga
Oh shit
