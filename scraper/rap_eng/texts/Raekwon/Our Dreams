[Hook: Michael Jackson sample]
No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Hey yo listen here shortcake Camay glow
You know we both make angels when we lay in the snow
Heat the house with the oven when the chips got low
Because Tony can't be out there pushing that blow
We made plans and dreams, not grands and schemes
I want to search for the meaning of love, see what it means
Because we hustle so hard, cross so many bridges
Made babies, took trips to the mall for family pictures
And our souls is magnetic, we the meaning of destiny
Be that banker of trust that looks to invest in me
Together, to get her, means for me to get you
We back, reunite like the Wu
See we soulmates, we melt like cookies and cream
And I fiend for the days and the nights to sex my queen
So no matter how hard it seems, dreams come true
Keep Allah in the heart, hugs and kisses
Tony Starks

No matter how hard the times may seem

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Still applying the pain
The purple frying my brain, this woman crying again
She tired of fighting, my feelings likely the same
That's what happens when you wife them they try and tighten the chain
See, she in the right so I put her right in her lane
I'm all night with the pipe I can feel her biting my chain
She got her own I ain't got to buy her a thing
I be burning up the sheets every time I'm lighting the Jane
We go together like Martin and Gina
But she get uptight want to fight like Ike and Tina
So love her or leave her alone like I don't need her though
A minute later I'm back like “I ain't mean it yo”
We break up just to make up
She fly without the makeup
Together we upgrade to A+
So all this bickering ain't us, we bigger than that
You only cool when I'm digging your back
Now fall back baby

[Hook: Michael Jackson sample]
No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Shorty with the flavor like Breyers
Real sweet with your thick legs
Look like you drink eggs, you lying
Now you met a Teflon don
Stay high, Levi's on
YSL frames no games
I'm into cash man, getting this paper
Buying up acres
Ride around and yo fuck with my neighbours
Pocket full of hundreds and weed
Light the Philly cigar up
And go dolo, ride through SoHo
Ya that little baby in the back
That's the sound of sweet life
A sweet wiz will make you a sweet knight
Chill with the pawns, we on
Because life is a chess board
You better have your sword and vest on
Never hate your enemies because it affects judgment
They only hate it if they know you getting hella cheese
That's what it is, what it do for you?
Don't let the truth bore you
Word up, don't let the youth spoil

[Hook: Michael Jackson sample]
No matter how hard the times may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges can turn us around
Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found
