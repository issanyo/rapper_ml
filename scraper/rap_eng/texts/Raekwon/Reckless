[Verse 1: Styles P]
I’m accustomed to getting fast dough
And chicks that hold work by they asshole
Standing by the pool in a bath robe
Bullet in your caesar  or your afro
Lookign at the don and the apple
Be the biggest prize if real niggas was raffled
You baffled, throw you off the scaffold
Or hit you with the scalpel like the doctor
Rap style proper, imminent gun popper
West side highway flyer, coke chopper
Only fuck with niggas that prosper
Bitch ass niggas love to gossip
Get highford, get Kennedy
Get your ass turned to a memory
Remember he, remember him
Play me nigga, you’ll never win

[Hook x2]

Reckless
Reckless
Reckless
All coocoo, all loco

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
You don’t owe me nothing but real rap
Under the laundry bag is still wap
Shoot first, not from sideways, niggas is young boys
Ringers is OJ’s, blow crazy
Under the building, Poltergeist in it
Sucked in the low best with ice in it
Buy cars, running through Mars, snatch yo jewels and dip dodge
And don’t make me whip, it’s sergeant now
It’s rough in the 718
Roll out, 11 niggas, snitches gone bate
We’re strapped in the max with the lifers and indoor cyphers
Do anything to kill more Nikes up
Wilding with the wolves in the woolriches
Mostly yall niggas’ hoes is hood bitches
Catch you in the flicks, know the game 456
We bubble cocaine with the quick

(Hook x2)

Reckless
Reckless
Reckless
All coocoo, all loco

[Verse 3: Styles P]
We in the same game but it’s different endings
Yeah it’s polo but it’s different linen
Got a gun but never been on a mission with it
Seen crack but never been in the kitchen with it
Never caught a nigga slipping with it
You just rapping like a criminal
I’m a criminal rapping, a 5 star general
Fuck fake niggas, the message ain’t subliminal
Better take your vitamins and minerals
You talk a lot and the bullets when I’m the interview
So wutchu say now?
Free shit, got bullets to give away now
Free shit, you get down or lay down
But once you laid down you stay down
‘Cause that’s 2 to the dome piece
Bullets in your hair like the phone piece

(Hook x2)

Reckless

All coocoo, all loco
