[Intro: Raekwon]
Li-li-live from New York (2x)
Is you watchin what's on my motherfucking neck nigga?
Li-li-live from New York (2x)
Live from New York

[Verse 1:  Raekwon]
All white bolon, the allie pulled on
Kept his fade low, rocked suede in the snow, blue Tahoe
A wizard on the keyboard, eyes look bloodshot lord
Nevermind that, climb the award
In the system we just missed 'em
Came through banging nothing but Wu, the crowd blitzed 'em
Much love, autograph, carryin the champagne glasses
Crazy asses, niggas on his neck like ski masks
Chill step on me, axe slash through a little fifty and crash
I wanna drink, knew she'd pocket the cash
Buck summer night hype nigga, Iron Man blowin the mic
You motherfucking right, live highlight
Then I seen him, nigga was raw, stepped in
Bitches flexin' next to him, bad Mexicans
What up showin' you love, you got a real style
"Where you from?", "The Isle", that's Staten Isle, love no doubt
Oh God, he had a drink about a hundred
Some strange nigga think he had a range, God got blunted
Pay attention this essent' like sacks and macks
He did the knowledge, ran to the bar and grabbed stacks
Now the whole parties bubblin', niggas got love his bug
He had on one glove, rollin' up drugs
Him and his Vikings ran through, stopped played the back then they walked through, Live from New York where niggas hawk you

[Hook x2: Raekwon]
Gettin money and laced up, Live from New York
Gettin' reefer to blaze up, Live from New York
Gettin' niggas to dance and yellin', "Throw both hands up"
Won't pull your pants up, Live from New York

[Verse 2:  Raekwon]
Madonna money in our pocket, boating in a rocket
Bout to blast off, we charged like a socket
Whips be cleaner than a fuck, jewels basically struck
Straight up brolic style laying in the cut
Bottles strictly Dom, ring the alarm
Rollie on the arm, arms crossed, new sneakers on
Fly shit, Nikes the majority
NYC state of mind and we talk with authority
5 Boroughs is sterile, still out of town playing mellow
I thought I seen Shalon swade yellow
Rippin' it, new six flippin' it
Shorty is drip dippin' in it when she sit, throw dick in it
Came to conclusions, what's the solution when your losin'?
Respect mine, now from the foul line
Streets is a part of us, teaching the seeds through the heart of us
Some get locked, that's a scar on us

[Hook: 3x]
