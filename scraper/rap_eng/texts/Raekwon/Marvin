[Verse 1: Raekwon]
April 2nd 1939, the stars is in line
Divine intervention at it's own intention
Birthed a gift, in this DC kid, he sung heavenly
Good values and all and his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful, the angels would serve her
What's her name? It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church, to making his own band
Called the Moonglows, sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy, panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy, he wore a smile just to hide it
Behind them doors him and his father constantly colliding

[Hook: Cee Lo Green]
Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Destined for greatness, counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him, you know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife
Pretty Anna Gordy, she made his time sit still
She was the cousin of Barry G, the founder of Hitsville
Please pay attention because the story it gets ill
Shit's real, trials and tribulations son's facing
You gotta play the cards you're dealt
Ain't no telling what life deals
Death will cause you to have night chills
Enough to keep a nigga bothered
Especially when the negatives start coming from your father

[Hook: CeeLo Green]
Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Money, women and drugs came into play
Now wouldn't you know, there goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammi Terrell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself, from the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up, got his act together
Spiritually he claims, you could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong, revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out "Honey don't do it!"
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot the scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son defines wicked

[Hook: CeeLo Green]
Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

[Outro]

It's the sound of the music
