[Chorus: Pody (Raekwon)]
Strong Isle, Staten Isle, Stapleton to Little Bricks
Cook coke, stack dough, we all make that money flip
(Aiyo, Po', get money, nigga) Island 2 Island
(Keep stacking them ones, man) Island 2 Island
Strong Isle, Staten Isle, Stapleton to Little Bricks
Cook coke, stack dough, we all make that money flip
(This is real nigga shit, man) Island 2 Island
(Shaolin, we cousins, nigga) Island 2 Island

[Pody]
Cash rules, snatch jewels, flash tools, breeze through
Remind you that I'm high to, this is what life do
Cook coke, cut throats, Po' got the best smoke
Inject them with the raw dope, contact from haze smoke
Days in a trench coat, shit I'm broke
Niggas on the prowl, with these rich hopes, target these rich folks
Big, have a type of dough, jack 'em in the Range Rov'
Bodies in the back row, grind through the hood, slow
Eyes on that money flow, infer from the block, ho
Bricks say he gotta go, call Boots, we gotta roll
Hit 'em high then hit 'em low, count it on the way home
Sliding in the hoop dog, listen to Snoop Dogg
Man, I'm ready to die, homey, throw that Big on
Crime on my mind, like it's right, but I know it's wrong
Niggas said to drop dime, cuz we putting hits on 'em
Flip on 'em, I'm known as the boy with the grip on 'em

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Aiyo, you put your hand on 'em, I'm bodying you, just like the Gotti crew
Brand new shotty blew, rubbergrip, tommy tool
Bust off, find me duke, ain't no place you can hide
Cuz I'm behind you, right there, reminding you
Real niggas carry burners, all of us, black fatigues
What it be like, we money niggas serving drugs
Cash rule burglars, that's cool, work with us
Nikes on, Champs shirts, Champion work for us
Everybody cock blocking, fly nigga, stop shopping
FBI keep clocking, niggas owning meat markets
Sorta like fish markets, all my niggas wrist sparkle, I'm fair
Play me one time, I'mma piss park you
Niggas go to sleep, yea, niggas that'll leap on your ear
And throw a slug in your mouth, and put your meat there
Roll that beat clear, me, Po', wrestle your streets
So if you need us, you better have your heat near

[Chorus]
