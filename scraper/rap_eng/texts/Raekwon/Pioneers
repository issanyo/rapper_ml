Fly as the new Five
Live as a white man with black skin
Powerful grimeys, who eat raw like Chinese
Petty cases of coke, boat loads of good ol' dough
We carry back to Medina from Beringia
Feed me a Spanish, half-black, massive back
Thick in the legs, bank account stacked
A nigga with a liable piece of gold
A ranch made of brick white picket fence
Vision my dick
Six horses, four Shar Peis, crib like Holyfield
Build mine slowly, grow G
And a lesson building in manifestin'
Keep the stress off your chest
Then get money like Mexicans
Live as a corner with hard rocks
And big nines and dimes, I'm only part 2
And you a dart
Distinguished gentlemen who love getting dick sucks
Hate comical rap, but kill men for 10 bucks
The palm lady spit on my grave and said, "Chef, you stay paid"
One shell hit you I fell with you
And till then, blow forever
Keep family snakes away -
You got a daughter to treasure
Have twins name one Caesar, female called Anisha
We out to Fiji on Easter
Good bottle of wine
Nine on me dwelling on time
Wearing bally sneaker watch Phillip Stein
Mad grey in my waves, 101-EX
Exelero behind me, dumbstruck meat heads
Thinking of the days I got robbed, not for money
When I mean albums, they couldn't catch it I fouled them
But now more aggressive, checks look special too
Do the knowledge, young boy, we professional
