[Intro: Raekwon:]
Yeah (whadup)
Another, another my nigga

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
We that cold weather
Sunk in the tent
Phone Valetta had the sweater
Paid 9 grand, on call machete
Fascinating in gun fights, wallabies is Chris
It's like a fresh new rhyme on the disk
Cut niggas like Zorro
Bullhorn gaff the borough that's Staten
New Brighton hell niggas, what's happening?
Harbor where the gangsters live
Stapleton, Smooth Willie's
All of us fly high
Peace to my goon Gilley
Chef, criminals have to eat ferocious
Six wheels, Maybach black, blowing on roaches
The empire is built from the ground up
I come around, what?
You get nothin' now
Stand there all frowned up
The emperor especially in buildings
Got a temper
No money coming slapping
Something down, it's suspenders
Now back to my shorty at hand
How you want it?
What's the plan?
Just be cool
Converse with your man

[Verse 2: Amerie]
So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It's starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly you and I
We fall in love
So many reasons why

[Hook: Amerie]
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we fall in love?

[Bridge: Amerie]
Why don't we fall in love?
It's so many reasons
It's the only thing that lies to me

[Verse 3: Amerie]
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one
I never want to go
Things I never did
Now I want to do
And love I never felt
Now I feel for you
Why?
I want to just swallow
Each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do
I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend

[Hook: 2x]

[Outro:]
Come with me
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed
