Yo (x4)
Yeah
It's the chef right here
Life is so real y'all
I feel you you know
Word up
Let's talk some real y'all
We came up from the same box, inseparable tag team
We brothers from another mother, partners that grime
We blew our first branch together, got lifted in the hallways
Cut class we was fly. Niggas in the makin'
With no fare
Running round in the concrete jungle yo
Whoever thought the bomb would crumble
It blew though
We hear rich willys with Phillies
Sit back tell tales of the real and breathe positive things
You feel me?

Word up

I'm gonna tell you how I was told cause I was told by the OG's
They told me they say: yo number one never give up
Never give up man
Number two;
Love the people that love you man
And don't love more than you supposed to
But you give it up cause you know its real
For real man
Word up

Strive for perfection, live life
Addictions that bring karma
Life's good
Blowin' my ganja in the wind, vibin'
A man with his plans to add on
You know me from the black bombers
The rocker, suits, bow-tie shits
All the fans love and live yours
Just like I live mines
Count to a hundred
The blessings come big time
I say this, regardless, with patience
Check the flows that nourish the mind just like a steak dish in the matrix
One

This is real right here man
Clean vibe, you know?
One hundred, yeah
And do it, and do the shot
