[Hook]
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottom nigga I came up
So many niggas surround me, wanna flame somethin'
I'm like cool out, no money here, change up
We pop bottles in this bitch to get our name up
I come from under the bottom nigga we came up
So many niggas surround me, wanna flame somethin'
I'm like cool out, no money here, change up

[Verse 1]
Little leather niggas get it
I come from the back door with 40 lil live niggas with me
All on mollys, it's nothing
Fresh niggas they up
Some in the mailroom in the club lighting blunts up
Walk through new jury, clothes is silks only
Besides galllons of milk with big bills on me
True the jewels is fluorescent
They used to light niggas who got all they shines out stretchin'
Do you in the dark, whatever come out the light
Better be bread, or weed, or gold tonight
Get to schemin' shoot the shit up with real niggas in here
They all mine as long as they know the night
Yeah that's the shit I don't like
Shawty gave me dome hype
Grab her facemask, don't bite
I'm in my mansion in the zone writin'
I'm known for throwin' lightnin'
I stand alone yo, one titan

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Post the seven in the rain
Come through with seven chains
They call me legend out in Maine
Known for tiltin' niggas wigs
Don't kill the kids for not knowin' where real rap remains
Treacherous MC, react like Jack Dempsey
Yeah the Billboard whorin' up MC
Fly as ever, one level, one rebel
Who cool out in the Cayamans with thugs, crews, and gangs
Yeah I rap for the merrier
Dance my ass off, paper chasin' Captain, America
Fly high , live as a drive-by
Team of live wires who catch you outside we fire liars
Yeah them blow kids live on the gold kids
Never go broke, grab a tote to smoke nigs
Killas know to call me to go
For murderous rap music that get inside your head it's dope

[Hook]
