(featuring Raekwon)

[singer]
Tony for mayor.. (x4)

[Ghostface Killah]
Catch me in a crisp blue six, deep dish
Doors is crisp, velour stop at the wrist
Watch is involved, talk to me Trick Daddy
I liked the way you tilt ya hat up in that Caddy son
Can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
You son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad 'cause you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones
A bowl of milk almost killed you, ak, you almost drowned in Pops
I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you
And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga
Ha ha, you vexed, nigga?
No airplay

[Ghostface Killah]
Bet my gat spray

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Yo, that's hearsay you spray hairspray
And up North, nigga, you ain't gettin' jailplay

[Ghostface Killah]
(How you know?)

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Yo, it's obvious, Clan's day

[Ghostface Killah]
Hold on, let me park my shit
Let me find out this nigga barkin' and shit I'm a Don of this shit
And you know that shit I wrote with Golden Arms is a hit
My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six
Draped in yellow and I'm still poppin'
My movie life in the hood is like an ill doctrine
Beat trial with illegal aide, fuck Cochrane
And if it's on I might blow you if I'm boxed in.. {*echoes*}

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Yo what's wrong man?
Yo, yo, yo, what you doin', man?
Yo, man, chill out, man

[Ghostface Killah]
Don't even worry

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Why you..

[Ghostface Killah]
Ok

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Come on, son
We can't.. don't depart us like that, son
Come on

[Ghostface Killah]
I'ma destroy you

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Come on, man

[Ghostface Killah]
You pop too much shit

[Raekwon (as "the watch")]
Come on, man, I'm just tellin' you time

[Ghostface Killah]
It ain't even like that, you know who bought you
A nigga's just fuckin' with you, man

[Ghostface Killah]
Bye!

[singer]
Tony for mayor.. {*repeats to fade*}

[Outro: Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]
Yo, let me tell y'all mothafuckas somethin'
(Shoot one of those niggas, Lord)
We could battle for belts, ice (Type shit)
Whatever the fuck you want to do
Let me tell y'all somethin'
This the Theodore Unit, mothafucka
We takin' the bait of this shit
That's word to my momma, man
(Staten Island, nigga, what, nigga?)
Coke, spoon throwers (Get ya money right)
(Gotta know how real do this)
Slew-footed mothafuckas, I pop all y'all niggas
Y'all niggas is fucked, straight up
We back in here now, mothafuckas
It's the fuckin' Unit, you heard
That's the Theodore Unit
Y'all mothafuckas better recognize
Aight? That's my word
(Yeah, nigga, yeah)
