[Intro: sample]
Yes, I got you started, yes, I got you started
All over again

[Intro: Raekwon]
Uh... yeah..
This is on some Can It Be/C.R.E.A.M. shit, right here, too
Yeah, word up, take it there for these niggas, you know
Word up? Yo.. uh-huh, reminisce, nigga
Word up, nice sunny day, rainy day
Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo

[Raekwon]
Who would've thought I would've made it ya'll
Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who ya'll tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu became us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watchin "Ice Water" evolve
Destined to build a mountain - niggas is doubtin my work
Black millionaire, check what I'm worth
I gotta thank y'all for takin in Lex, I appreciate it
I apoligize for keepin y'all waitin

[Interlude: sample (Raekwon)]
Yes I got you started all over again (x2)
(Word up... let's go back... finish up)

[Raekwon]
Growin' up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
Plus my niggas got mouths to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here
Got to stop now, time is the issue

[Interlude: sample (Raekwon)]
Yes I got you started all over again (x2)
(One more jewel... one more... move... let's go, let's go)

[Raekwon]
It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

[Outro: sample]
Yes I got you started all over again (x4)
