[Intro]

[Hook]
The sun used to shine on my street, on my street
The moon was visible at all times
Light bulbs substituting my moonlight
Rays of the sun replaced by lamps

[Verse 1]
Gangsters, buffalos, flexing in bear hats
We call 'em Russians, New Yorkers'll wear that
Gambling outside Macy's, me and all these career rats
Don't know 'em but I'm about to break 'em
Ice roller bound, rolling in cracks
Yanks said stack it, this ain't how I get down
The crowd got silent, heavy face slap
He slapped his Wis in the face for looking down
Caesar with the half-moon, large gash wound on his face
Pretty boy, yo scarred for life
He ain't a sucker though, this nigga a killer
Caught his enemies up in the box, ill y'all, did 'em right
Now he rich, his partner's the real here
Curly haired Indian who sat in a wheelchair just scheming
Yeah Don, hop in the BM, come see me
Before you know it machine guns I'm seeing

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolling yard weed out the jars
All I see is bag beaches, king, black sand, Wallabee Clarks
We in intense mad colorful pictures, everybody get nice
Gift bags for the bitches that's ice
A-yo the shotty in Alex hand, chill in the foyer
Give your lawyer this bread and be cool, just stay a warrior
The East is in the building, bottles with sparkles on 'em
Yo Rae, I fuck with your waves with the goggles killing
That's what it is, Manhattan all the way to the Grand Rapids
We stay stunting with the clappers
Fishscale parties, commercial niggas bother me
We just as hard as they come, that's my discography
Medell√≠n music, part-time Cuban
Who only eat steaks and grapes, boo how you moving
Perfectionist, applause, kings cooling, new movement
Up in the Wraith I'm outta here, peace to Jeweler

[Hook]
