[Intro]
This for all them real niggas, man, that just be on some moves
Study their history, know what time it is
Move general, you heard?

[Verse 1]
Gold jewels ain’t my thing, kid, I’d rather wear none
Them vehicles I fly around I gave to my son
Growing grays, blowing haze, watching A Raisin in the Sun
Young buck buying some Bucks, the suede ones
My life story was right, shorty, cousins’ll fight for me
Blood, let’s wild out, let’s ride for the white, call me
Got older, got bolder, staircase days
Forty ounces, big bags to blaze, wearing capes
Bagging for hours, cooking up, wolves with power
Hooking up, those devoured, weak niggas foul up
No follow-up, then the connect came, we swallow up
Paying more, then we came with short money, pile it up
Rocking them niggas, they rocking us back
Cause every day we thrust back, felt like the work’ll reverse that
My worst cat’ll blow you in the church, black
The day that we felt got jerked we came to two guns and three bats

[Interlude: Gladys Knight sample]
It’s sad to think
We’re not gonna make it

[Verse 2]
We’ll break your legs for steak and eggs, the menu is taking regs
Beef patties with cheese, a Widala state at Ted’s
A money rich getting comrade, who fell in the storm
Bagged him, now we strong as hell and no going backwards
Leather jackets, new Astons, Mosans, crew flashing
Jealousy around the corner, niggas got two castles
Some with coke, some bubble capsules
Some went and sold dope, some came back broke and asking
The lifestyle is real, it can switch in a flash, kid
From living right to living and gone in a splash, kid
Think back to yesterday’s tactics, should’ve been an actor
Blessings, then became a rapper

[Outro: Gladys Knight sample]
For some ungodly reason
We just won’t let it die
I guess neither one of us
Wants to be the first to say goodbye
