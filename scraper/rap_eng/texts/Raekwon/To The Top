[Verse 1: Maino]
Let's take it to the top like a escalator
To touch me, you need a elevator
Black mob, my team strong, my style greater
Smooth criminal, white linen on yellow gaiters
Started with a dream to make it to a key
Now, we hoppin' outta cars that never use a key
Came out hard off credit cards and open schemes
Now, it's women who make a livin' right on their knees
All them nights, prayed a night for better days
Feelin' like Biggie in them Versace Shades
Vegas lights, sparkles bright, I got a wave
Feelin' right, bitches nice, I can't behave
Chillin' in Miami with my Cuban piece
She won't let me leave, grabbing on my Cuban linen
Pop Models, pop mollies in large dose
Pack light, pack hammers at them Award Shows

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Smoke screen, cooler than them boats, sellin' choke, jump out, the whole world know us
I'm only rich, floating
Real Deal Bentley, niggas
Feel them heaters, we them Beatles
Pull out on family members, snaking leaders
Quarter-Million shit on the stove
Got some real Brooklyn killer-stack niggas with me
Spit on your globe
Got my Lawyer in the back of the foyer
Eatin' saute√©d fish, pass the goya
My gun named Toya
Marble Floors in the Benz
The rims is regular
Come through, new lots ?
Adorned with a sword in his leather
And I've been on the walls
In Ossining. And bring it back
The best and my cleaver came with me
Yo, King with me, reload quickly
I'm surely down fifty a cheeba, elloquently
I relax in the Waldorf
Under the covers, and the sword off
Sweat this shit, growing a mohawk
Ready to blow off
