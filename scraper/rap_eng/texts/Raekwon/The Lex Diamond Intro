Dirty as you go there was a gangster born
He controlled the island with over 4000 soldiers
He ran over 30 projects
Whatever you needed in the hood, you had to go through him
He had his hand in everything
Racketeering, money laundering, gambling, prostitution
It was all his for the taking
He had over 400 cops on the payroll
He organized a powerful elite with a cold heart and a hot hand
And those who were perpetrators were dealt in a torturous way
The neighborhood loved and feared him
He had a good heart and a fresh soul
His name is Lex Diamond and this is his story

? with the execution of my children
From that witness forward, everybody in that courtroom knew
Uh, and agreed, that the mafia existed
The mafia operated in the United States and Sicily
It had various rules and it didn't ? in this business
And that many of the people in that room were members of the mafia
