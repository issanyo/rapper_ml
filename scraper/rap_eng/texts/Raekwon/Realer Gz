[Verse 1 – Murda Mook]
Ay yo I think like 1000 bucks
Run outside, buy 1000 trucks
Don status to 1000 fucks
Love my girl, love life, hug right
I’m jumping in the wrangler white, what a world
Hugged in diamonds like I’m Snow White, my bed is furs
We pull up in the what ups, we up son
Hugging my finger, all glean, all mean
More light like Edison, the better it seem
Just a realer Gz, rolling some killer leaves
Flashbacks when the king scoops you in the Philippines
Riding in limos, getting brick money MOs
Put a whore right in her place, smack your dentals
Toast to getting paper patsy, yes I’m straight don
You could say the rate great Gatsby
Sly as ever, new level, who whatever
Blue bezel, desert boot on, golden medals
Real legends carry weapons, I walk through flexing
Watch the bomb drop, spit game detection
Dressed up arm in a splint, me and my woman
That’s my limp, she been right there holding my gimp
Come on ride baby, roll out
Let’s fly through the globe now
Call it the Chev show, sold out

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Raekwon]
The illest nigga breathing, cops shift for no reason
Rock shit that don’t drop until next season
Next season I rock what was dropped last season
I be fucking their head up, catch me out in Vegas somewhere fucking this bread up
And we was in the same lane until I sped up, dead up
You talk beef, I talk lettuce
That kinda explain just where my head is
Dollar sign language, we’re Rosetta
I first met her in bullshit V
She cracked a smart remark, I bet this don’t take 93
Whether she knew or not, I was bluffing her
I really couldn’t tell and that’s why I fuck with her
All black Caddy truck like the governor
In front of her friends I scooped her and her mother up
Pool punch try to linger round, they offer weed
But my niggas don’t smoke that garbage
We only smoke the grade A, best from the harvest
A few Menajes, new Ferraris
Just another day at the office
Shopping sprees in a plain white T
Why the fuck with a nigga like me
We some realer Gz, puffing on some killer leaves
You know what a nigga mean
