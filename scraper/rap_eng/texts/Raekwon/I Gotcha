Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Girl, you know that I am someone you can count on
When things get rough
When things get tough
I'll be there when no one else is around
So don't ever let me down
And I don't want to see you frown

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Always I'll be with you
Through the thick and thin
And all the other things you feel within
Always I will try
So now I think it's time
And now I'm gonna make you mine

Girl, you know that I am someone you can count on
When things get rough
When things get down
I don't want to fuss and fight
I just want to make it right
Loving you is all I wanna do, baby

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe

Oh, hey
I don't want to fuss and fight
I just want to make it right
Aaaah, oh
See when no one else is there
I'll be standing by your side

Don't worry 'bout a thing
My love is on the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Cause I gotcha, babe
