[Raekwon]
Ayo seven and a half ounces of brain cells, brain well
Frames, fiery flame, the smoke great well
Bounce, the blacky black khaki shit
By Supernat, you know the deal cousin, come through your town
Snatch me, Muggs shit, thug shit, grenades that strap to they chest
Dukes Of Hazzards be jumping over the rest
Yep the beats bang, we slangin trees lit, leaves lit
Other than that we don't need shit, you eat shit bitch

[Supernatural]
The spit boxer, the hip-hopper
This shit's cinematic to me like a black opera
I never smoke back woods if they not groomed proper
Me and Rae dropping bombs from the helicopter
The rap scientist, with skills that are truly legendary
Chef cooking up some shit, teaching me the culinary
Crazy, colorful, supernice with vocabulary
I'm getting this paper now by any means neccessary

[Hook 2X: Raekwon]
I got bars, you got bars
Put us together right now you'll get sixteen bars
Standing behind me is sixteen guards
Bruised, battered and scarred, but their styles are odd

[Raekwon]
Ayo lace something, spray something down for my nephew
This what Lex do, a hot pot of grits in his left booth
Fast speed and shit whole clothes, we ain't gotta beat em
His head gon pop, hus eyes filled with semen

[Supernatural]
The spit fighter, the rap scanner
I smoke the Incredible Hulk, they call it Bruce Banner
The style ultra, but they say the flow gamma
I'm catching a body and then jetting off to Indiana

[Raekwon]
Ayo Brooklyn, Shaolin
Shorty lookin at me, flashing with her style on
It's nothing my mami she let me whistle thousands
And gave me a vision to write about a ?child on?
Fouls is long, album strong
A hundred thousand dons come through when ?isles? get on
Trials is on, them cowards is on
Who got the power cat?
Me and Supernat, what's the problem pa? You're wack

[Supernatural]
If I got problems then I'm calling the squad
I got more on the phone then I started calling the God
Said "Don't worry Supernat, we gon do our thang"
I'm a let this bang like I was Dr. Strange
Half of these cats nowadays is crooks
Playing characters inside life like comic books
See I spits the rhyme son all day
They call him Lex Diamonds, I'm building with the God ?call braid?
When I think, I connect like a Cuban Link
Half of these cats is wack, and they whole style extinct
Yeah, and when I shoot, I go straight for the heart
Touching you in the mental with the verbal darts

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Stolen down man, this ill ass fucking beat right here man
Ayo Muggs, good looking out, see what I want, one
Hold your fort nigga, you know how it go
Word up, ayo Shane, whattup nigga
Keep it official, know what I'm saying?
Word up, the Clan nigga, Shallah Raekwon, Louis Rich
Supernat, hold it down, word up, niggas know about the kid
Word up, hold it down, the fort nigga you know what I'm saying (fades out)
