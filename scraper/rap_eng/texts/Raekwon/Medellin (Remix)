[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo pastel Clarks
Between me and you its the darts
Full body cut ripped from a shark
I'm like a wide body Benz with no rims
Seats is python, feets is Nikon
Beats is pipe bombs, the leader, the icon
You sleep I might gon'
Your heats in bright armor
That's me, a delegate
Crush niggas like elephants
Irrelevence, I stay flexed and plus intelligent
Live for the paper
Acrobatic, Illmatic with a bat
Twist you right in front of your rat
Be a new chamber, Wu chamber, Wu banger, the zoo flamer
This is how we do shit stranger
I'm just as real as they come, the harder the martyr
Shallah cum thicker than lava
The author, blade sharper
The suede blazer
Wally washer
Slang roll up the Garcia

[Hook]
What wasn't meant to be could never be
The shit niggas say they do we never see
They love it when I turn this booth to medellin
Everything I speak is pure like medellin
The hist I move, shit this the real thing
I think its time to let the metal sing
They love it when I turn the booth to medellin
Everything I speak is pure like medellin

[Verse 2: (?)]
Ay yo this the remix, that New York street shit
That Lex Diamonds architects, Killa Beez shit
Get 40 belows on, the rose don
Snow beats, and purple tapes to zone on
Its Wu-Tang and Mpire, Doza be the beat supplier
Chop it up, break it down, its fire
This the move of the year, don't act up
You fuckin' gettin' smacked by a chair
Back when MPBs was ill
I was on the block banging dope for Cuban links for real
Whack niggas should chill
You wasting time, you taking space
We shoot to kill
Ka-ka plow
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
Rest in peace Dirty Bastard, rugged and uncut
Coming live from these New York slums who want some
Redrum, get done, enemies spare none
Its the mother fuckin' remix

[Hook]
What wasn't meant to be could never be
The shit niggas say they do we never see
They love it when I turn this booth to medellin
Everything I speak is pure like medellin
The hist I move, shit this the real thing
I think its time to let the metal sing
They love it when I turn the booth to medellin
Everything I speak is pure like medellin

[Verse 3: (?) &  (?) ]
Yeah
This that raw phonetic gin
So pure its heaven sent
One snort you head'll spin

I'm just spitting my slang in quick lemon meringue
I lit the Mary Jane, effective medicine

Uh
Build with giants, the skills a science
Don't be fooled, dress like deers we kill like lions

Scale the violence, the men kill the mices
I'm ill decisive, the Catskills Tyson

We them dudes your chicks check for
Without trying I line 'em up like Connect Four
Whatchu expect, the only thing I respect the connect
When I check 'em when its time to collect more

Rae on the joint that's a bucket list check-off
(?) you lames, I break your neck off
Taught to protect that, don't forget that
Like giving a fiend credit you won't ever get your bread back
Pendajo

Everything I speak is pure like medellin

They love it when I turn the booth to medellin
Everything I speak is pure like medellin
