[Chorus 2X: Soul 4 Real]
If you wanna live my life
The world is getting more and more trife
It's time to shed some light
That's what I like, that's what I like

[Raekwon]
Raised fly while we in the midst of getting high
Take a walk through memory lane, watching when all the pain fly
Things that, happen in relationships, dealing with weapon
And men be on the same bullshit
Let's travel, take a walk with me, yo
I'm like the whiskers that be blazing in your transister
Relax, spoil me, I be on the tour shortly
With enough to spread fortune out, lord, you caught me
We analitical thinkers, we crow too with top rankers
Big thick juicy rocks on the finger
Chill, all my niggas who keep it real
Throw your baseball hat down and keep paying your bills

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
A wiseman spoke on my behalf, til then I enquired the math
Rae exist with God in the half
Lessons, a mouth full of food, sit back
I tell a story for the blocks and the power moves
Shorties claiming that they hustle for a cause, get caught
In the sharp blade of a knife, but older niggas's go
But some shine, that's the best part of they flaws
They need cover, because we trapped inside these Winter Warz
I come to ya'll as Elijah, stars on the crown symbolizes
Planets for a new horizon
It's all peace when you sizing, the next man enterprising
Learn how to move, don't disguise it
The bulk of the brick will be shown, you all alone
All you think about is getting you fly, that's getting you torn
The evil that maps out of my vulture, murder raps'll sculp you
Hip hop selected our culture
One nigga word ain't enough, let's get up and exercise
The mind like a sit up, walk with your chin up
Post that stormy winter, animos'll tear a friend up
Principals make a nigga light dimmer

[Chorus 2X]

[Raekwon]
It's like Babylon, my society, so wild, been a variety
Which make me seek prosperity
Brothers and sisters let's connect, show love and respect
The youngings is watching, put 'em in check, yo
Your life could change in a sec, ambitions, you bet
Today your here, tomorrow, leaving out the projects
Wake up, we all got morals, striving for perfection
It's just a lesson to look forward to, yo

[Chorus 2X]
