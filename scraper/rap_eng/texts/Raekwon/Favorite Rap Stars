[Verse 1: Styles P]
My niggas flippin' it all day
Either on the corners or up in the hallways
Coke from Cuba, but they got it on Broadway
Pitchers on the front stoop, shooters in the doorway
...you a marble in the jacuzzi
The elevator ride to the top'll make you woozy
Either shootin' the Uzi or the MK
Starter in the game, you just get in when the bench play
At your door with the four, "bonjour" like the French say
Nigga you just plain, cut you up like a sensei
Take you down like the statue at Penn State
Get you off your feet like an Olajuwon head fake
Come, come, comin' with Havoc to bring the havoc
Lightin' the chronic, Techtronics and automatics
Beware of the short niggas
Yeah I'm cool, but I'll motherfuckin' torch niggas

[Hook: Havoc]
All along...
Been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs
Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads
And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone
All along...
Been them niggas that been reppin' in your favorite rap songs
Hold it for the hood, it's money over broads
And we hustle in the cold 'til the whole pack gone

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm one in a million, diamond in the rough
Supplying that stuff that got every whip that I drive
Tough lion took steroids, olympian status
Gold medalling them niggas, ain't nothin' 'bout me average
Cannons bigger than me, we go deaf when we shoot 'em
And niggas on the floor with they cerebellum oozin'
Every homie I brand with them featured on Gangland
Ice picks in pencil pockets and nines on they waistbands
Money over bitches, we smother then we ditch 'em
I'll have 'em bag 'em up, butt-ass in the kitchen
I'mma leave bitches foamin' at the mouth
Fuck what you heard, it wasn't drought, they lied
Over here it's all the way gully
In the morning, answer to God's calling
Snoring, I can't afford to sleep, the cousin of death
The city never sleeps, so why the fuck would I rest?
It's all about the motherfuckin' 'jects, Lex Diamond's up next

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Pull up, clap and distract you
Six cars away, yo, your brother in the back of the Ac'
I move pistols, hold 'em like infants
Jump out, rims, tints, guns is French, I can dent this
Out in Moscow Seagal style, look at the pair
Don't stare when the chain is a watchtower
We when we comin', ain't a Glock pulled
Rock the pyjama look
So now drama look like an eye-full
Coats Columbian with money in it
Ruthless Gotti, leather gloves on, the Wallies is blue body
Movin' through the dice game kickin'
Should have mittens on
Plottin' to dig in your pockets, we break niggas
Jumpin' in the A8's with swish men
Watches is Swiss, Chase Bank niggas
Drop you and then sprint
Don't ever dare walk in front of me
Cold as I wanna be
An old nigga who pump where the money be

[Hook]
