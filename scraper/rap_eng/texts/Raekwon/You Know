[Intro]
Sometimes it feels like
The world spin opposite of the way you spin
Sometimes you just gotta create your own
A world

[Verse 1: Allan Kingdom]
I been on a mission, man
I been on a mission lately
Some sticky situations, I just grinder down to make it
I’ve never been to prison, man
Still don’t know what it is to break free, no, no, no
Now I live my vision plan, no need to hallucinate
The nigga be slipping, man, I think they gon’ make me angry
If they would’ve listened I coulda kept my cool today
Evil got me tripping, man, I don’t think that you can say, no, no
You’re in my position, man, you just couldn’t hit the brakes

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I can’t believe it, word on the street's
One of my soldiers talking to them alphabet boys
My first reaction is to find out who, where and why
Put the word out and bring ‘em to me now, but keep him alive
Put some bread on his head and make sure he arrive
'Cause this is something I ain’t tolerating
Plus I’m getting impatient
I’m fiending to break him, for real, boy, I’m salivating
My phone rung, it’s after ten o’clock sharp
They said they had ‘em in one o’ my warehouses by the dock
Jumped in the Benz with a ill look, no grin
With a still hook, I’ma ‘bout to do this coward in
When I got there, indeed, he was already tied up
Pillow case on his head and the blood stains dried up
The moment I been waiting for is finally here
I get to see who done betrayed me
Snatched the pillow case off his wig
And told him, "Yeah, now it's time to face me"
Who I seen? My little niece boyfriend I seen
He begging me not to kill him, I told him I gotta
As I poured the gasoline, I thought about my little niece
I know she love him, but he a snail
He tried to put Shallah up in jail
Take me from my wife and kids
Why should I spare this maggot life to live?
Man, it is what it is, he chose to play this game
I lit the match and watched his frame go up in flames

[Bridge: Allan Kingdom]
Get emotion, we in motion
Make commotion, I can feel
How we roll on, keep it going
Let it go out, take the wheel
So open your eyes, I'm amazed, I know
So open your eyes to the things I know
We rode it for life, put the game on me
If we don't get it right, put the blame on me

[Verse 3: Allan Kingdom]
Guess again
Thought that you could pull the wool over a veteran
I would pull the trigger but I'm thinking that it's better I, better I
Burn you like a sinner, let me share the light, share the light (Yeah)
Gasoline, pour it in my tank, now it's absorbing in your skin
Man, this fool is dimmer
And I wish she had a better mind, better mind
Where you talking now, you were regretting mind, get it right
I been cutting loose ends, why your lips so loose talking?
I could fuck with new friends too
Gotta get it with that new star again
I could be a nuisance
But not if you use caution
I could be a nuisance, true
It’s time we write some new commandments
