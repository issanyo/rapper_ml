[Intro]
We here, lord
Let's go, lord, come on

[Verse 1]
On top of my game with cuban linx in my chain
Iconic, icon victorious, whenever the mic is on
Stay gettin' it if this foul place see the semi's clapped
Bad Brazilians with hourglass figures and doobie wraps
Wordplay is wicked as wild flour, this wild power got me flyin' over the globe
'Mega, where you be at? Not where I be
Rich, wealthy and ruthless in Morocco blowin' [?] , striving for more chips
Steady cheese, guap, papes, bread, C.R.E.A.M, whatever
From the projects to small islands, stylin', we run together
It feel good, don't it? Compliments from yours truly
Some people doubted but, but fuck it, my source rules
Judge wise when I'm connecting dots, I'm so smooth
Make a toast for the king diamond, I'm that dude
Fantastic, repetitive classics
My style's made to dress you, I style on you bastards

[Hook]
From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
And watch words flip

[Interlude]
Yeah, son, yeah, son, sick
That's Jameson's
You know how we do
We coming out with nothin' but the raw
Let me tell you nigga's somethin', man
We here, lord
Y'all know nothing about this life, man
Let me tell you one time

[Verse 2]
Glorious, wine deliverer
Givin' y'all somethin' so fruitful, truthful
Hard felt celebrating this legacy, longevity
I define it, garments, they all designers
Shoes that be the brightest, my women that be the finest
Dining, five star restaurant, exotic shellfish
Prominent gift, kush cologne, I smell rich
They tell me not to shine, I can't help it
It was meant for me to floss, and make hits 'til them digits add more comma's
Artillery for drama, beaucoup armor
Let the piranhas eat up a hater's flesh, sleep and [?] pyjamas
From a [?] I pull [?] out on you [?]
Number one Don, Lex so sophisticated, educated
Word complex, throughout your project echoes
And y'all ain't heard half of it yet
My badge is that of a vest
Signatures, anxious to sign more checks

[Hook]
From the drug game I learned how to stay focused
Back up in this, yeah, getting the world it's fix
Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
From the drug game I learned how to stay focused

Hustlers mentality, you know me, son, for slangin' that shit
Apply the same rules to music and watch words flip
And watch words flip
