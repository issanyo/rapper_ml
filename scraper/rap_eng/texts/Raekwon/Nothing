[Intro]
Fly money shit
Niggas always love this type of shit, nigga
You know what I’m sayin’?
This is for the fuckin skunks out there, nigga
For the fuckin robbers, nigga
And angry niggas, man
For real, man, it don’t stop
It never did, nigga, neither
Real rap, nigga
Let’s go in, nigga, stop playin’ with these niggas, man

[Verse 1]
Yeah, there he go flashing his armor
Army jacket jumping in new Fisk Karma
Project niggas low garments
Tolerance level is low
Dough fly through, yep we on it
Yeah
Scheming in the back of the Benzes
Hundred shot, AK, straight off your lenses
Do it again, screw-face a new face up again
This is how I know it’s a win
You know we pop rappers down and them broke actors
Tax athletes, yap you at the track meet, black
Keep it a thousand while we slap niggas right in they houses
Let’s take the jewelry off you want an ounce, kid
Real niggas know real niggas’ll blow
At any given second it’s real, gimme the go
And Imma tear one of y’all apart slow
Then scar you with one of these daggars and drag you through the snow

[Chorus]
When you take another man’s pride or put him outside his character
Got the Mac in his mouth, he yellin’
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)
When you dealin’ with shorts that ain’t a lot, it’s just a knot
And your pockets on silt yellin’ “kill something now” because
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it’s one thirty, I’m worthy and dirty
Stepped off the elevator, spray game curvy
Strep throat, less flow herb me
Ready to catch somethin’, snatch somethin’ up, word to Ernie
Yeah, we hillbillies, all of the real willies
Smoke grass, pop mollies, call him a pill-billy
Catch him in the field, do him real silly
Puddle of blood in the mud, that’s for frontin’, lookin’ real leery
Grab the flex-and-relax niggas
Automatic tax, not askin’, get your jawbone fractured
We can make a mess or do it classy
I’m talkin’ to you, you in the red leather
Niggas wear lead leathers
He felt bad but respected me
Pass the watch and the chain off respectably
Moseyed off, ran through Schenectady
We ain’t amongst none of them niggas, all them niggas sex to me

[Chorus]
When you take another man’s pride or put him outside his character
Got the Mac in his mouth, he yellin’
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)
When you dealin’ with shorts that ain’t a lot, it’s just a knot
And your pockets on silt yellin’ “kill something now” because
(I have nothing)
(I, I have nothing)
