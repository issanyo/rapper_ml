[Intro: Raekwon]

Bring some of that chocolate. God damn. Let's get it
Titanium niggas

[Verse 1: Raekwon]

Potentest smoker wrote this
The nigga in a black Aston an he roll with Ghost
They like two wild Jamaicans that don't play
Bud and guns get blown, lift the top of your toupee
Fingers on the side of my eyes
Don't care about the next niggas thoughts
Kiss ya corpse and die
Behead niggas the sword got a license
Driving a new S, kidnap niggas like ISIS
Fuckery I hate it
See a lot of them snake niggas live next to you, just sayin'
In the Mandalay faded
Don Julio, waiter tip the whore, stop playing, get acquainted
Look you the Chef, the cook, I got stressed and looked
He had a vest on, expect the jux
We got your back daddy, hood niggas got you
Word in jail don't let nothing touch the God or shots

[Verse 2: The O'Jays]

(What they do)
(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

All you fellows who have someone
And you really care, yeah, yeah
Then it's all of you fellows
Who better beware, yeah yeah
Somebody's out to get your lady
A few of your buddies they sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
And I don't think they'll miss

(What they do)
(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
I keep gettin' all these visits
From my friends, yeah, what they doin to me
They come to my house
Again and again and again and again, yeah
So are they there to see my woman
I don't even be home but they just keep on comin'
What can I do to get on the right track
I wish they'd take some of these knives off my back

(What they do)
(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers
(Back stabbers)
Low down, dirty

(What they do)
(They smile in your face)
Smiling faces
Smiling faces sometimes tell lies (back stabbers)
(They smile in your face)
I don't need low down
Dirty bastards (back stabbers)
