[Hook x2]
Lost my way
Fell down a hole
No-ones gonna come and save my soul
Lost my way
No going back
I'm stuck right here, and that is that!

[Verse 1: Plan B]
Look around this manor and all you'll see
Is ill mannered people iller mannered
Than the illest mannered person
You've ever met in your manor
Or are ever likely to meet
In any manor, cause this manor's deep
You judge them on the life that they lead
But then it's not all as black and white as it seems
They're all some way enslaved and their circumstances
Shape the way the behave in their battle on the street
That's why these kids ain't got no hope
Walking round there estates thinking "this is it"
They ain't ever getting out and it's no joke
Probably is the best of live they're ever gonna get
They don't believe they can succeed
Or the opportunities you send back there really exist
Cos they've been told every day from the minute they were born
By their fucked up parents that they ain't shit
Mum and dad never made nothing of themselves
Nah, so why the hell are they gonna?
School's a waste of time, there only gonna fail
Their older brother went jail, why ain't they gonna?
I mean they hang with thugs, and sell drugs
Ain't afraid to put a couple of slugs in you if you say something
They ain't all that way but you don't care either way
To you they're all just the same a bunch of thugs

[Bridge]
The youths that are out everyday
Working for the devil's plan
The young souls that went astray
Listen when you hear him say

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
The end is so hard, rockload all day pose
Fronting in the yard full of guards
Everybody fully equipped, clips with fullies, we the bullies
Make sure you float for the large
Always in fights, gun nights, whites
And ice with harpoons and the goons will slice you
Do it all for a money bag, flash the mag on your skull
Pull it, then let off a hundred fast
Usually in the coupe, no roof
Boots is loose laced
Fronting in the snow beach goose
Everything on the family, cover your son
One for one, bring horror like Ammity Ville
Come to the hill, multiple shots fly
Young niggas die in the field
Youngins better stand for the hammer
For there is no one in time
It's all in your mind
I'm laying in prison

[Bridge]

[Outro]
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
(And if that happens then you've lost your way)
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
(And if that happens then you've lost your way)
If you don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Don't believe if something then you'll fall for anything
Fall for anything, fall for anything!
