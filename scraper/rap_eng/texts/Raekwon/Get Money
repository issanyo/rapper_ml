Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M, get the money, pow!

[Verse: Raekwon]
As I polly making bread, they blowing shots of molly
Dressing fly, bitches looking, I'm in a coupe Ferrari
All my niggas holding digits for all the haters, sorry
Suck a dick, ain't nothing you can do about it, get your gunning on it
Yeah, popping bottles, they thought we'd hit the lotto
We were just crack slingers yesterday, all in them fucking titles
Man we just sure to blow, I know my hoes don't argue
That dick stand here, here what you gonna do? Champ yo I'mma roll, what y'all know?
I check the Walabee straight from England
Word, heard the album, I know your singles fam
Laced this, laced up, on my real real, wanna say something?
We stay crazy, we stay fronting, we spray shit, we ain't laced something
Fuck around, get your head twist, make your wrist mine, keep a bitch pissed
At the same time I'mma blaze Chris in a rich car, watch the Matrix
We take bricks, we send them out to the nearest town, you pay for it
We see low gangsters from the rip, yo hold that handle when you hold that clip

Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Cash rule everything around me, C.R.E.A.M, get the money, pow!

Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
Get money, get money, everybody know how we get down
