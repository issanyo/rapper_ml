2 tablespoons of cinnamon
And 2 or 3 egg whites
A half a stick of butter
Melt it

Stick it all in a bowl, baby
Sir it with a wooden spoon
Mix in a cup of flour
You'll be in heaven soon

Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Suck on my chocolate salty balls
Stick 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed full of vitamins and good for you
So suck on my balls

A quarter-cup of unsweetened chocolate
And a half a cup of brandy
And throw in a bag or two of sugar
And just a pinch of vanilla
Grease up the cookie sheet
'Cause I hate when my balls stick
Then preheat the oven to three-fifty
And give that spoon a lick

Say everybody have you seen my balls
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up
Just stick my balls in your mouth

Suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed full of goodness, high in fiber
Suck on my balls

Hey, wait a minute
What's that smell?
Smell like somethin' burnin'
Well, that don't bother me none
As long as i get my rent paid on Friday
Baby, you better get back in the kitchen
'Cause I got a sneakin' suspicion
Oh man, baby
Baby
You just burnt my balls!

HELP ME!!
MY BALLS ON FIRE!!
HELP ME BABY, MY BALLS ARE BURNIN'!!
GET ME SOME WATER!!
POUR SOME WATER ON ME!!
MY BALLS ARE BURNIN'!!
OH MY GOODNESS!!
BLOW ON 'EM, BLOW ON 'EM
DO SOMETHIN'!!

Suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
THEY ON FIRE BABY!!
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
BLOW EM OUT BABY!!
OH!
SUCK ON MY BALLS, BABY!!!
SUCK ON MY BALLS, BABY!!
SUCK ON MY RED HOT, SALTY, CHOCOLATE BALLS!!!
