[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah yeah yo

Word up man come get this bread too man word up man

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
We at the [?] blowing on piff
Got the spliff barking my wrist glaring up
Blazing cold shark skin dicing with Tyson and Sugar Ray
Burning up a lot of ones cooling in the sauna all kind of Asians
Introducing my connects Lexis automor bed
She shot in the room and bought out the checks
You never know if there's cameras in here
I said in low tones flashing the gold phone around with begets
Yeah for you it's a big come up good looking out my nigga
Ninjas like you I ride to the death
I just stared nodding my head said it's peace soldier you just hood clumsy
But always kept it real I'm impressed
I ran a [?] like I was the best
Feeding my whores I gotta ranch spot that's killing up techs
The pussy $9.95 only cash no exceptions they all ill with ass injections yo

[Hook: N.O.R.E.]
Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E. & Capone]
Homie creeping out the lobby, hot as wasabi
I bet the doctor's party couldn't see as high as I be
I'm on the second floor with the .44, watching the entrance
While you pat him down Glock on the benches
We on some cab takin' shit, racist Jamaican shit
Put his shoes and money all in a bag we raid him shit
Yeah I know this Taliban, Afghanistan Pakistan
Tell him, "make a wrong move, then we blast his man"
Then I bust off, yellow tops like duck sauce
[?] cut from a different cloth
His moms is Miss Jones damn why you shoot her Pop?
Fuck everybody could get it there's no rules in guap
Then 'Pone told me, he was close to him
I felt bad, I just put the toast' to him
That's minor collateral damage granite, I stick up the planet
Take you with the left squeeze it right handed

[Hook: N.O.R.E.]
Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra
Anybody get it, everybody killer
Heights like, trife life drug dealer
A legend never seen like a chupa cabra
CNN, stick up shit, we on that ra ra

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E., Raekwon & (Capone)]
Still peeping out the project window, [?]
Shorty with the fanny she bimbo, it's simple

(Setting niggas up get em stuck while I'm pushing they mustache)
Yeah shorty do her [?]
Got some niggas trying to come and hang me
That shit only got me angry
That shit ain't never happen captain I'm right here
I'm just involved for the action, now you know my niggas won't fight fair
And 28 days later, Al-Qaeda, Noreaga
Killers from Haiti to [?]
Bringing more machine guns than guerrillas, Navy Seals [?]
Obama kept it real he fuck with us
And then 'Pone told me, it was his own shorty
They cut school together back then they drank forties
