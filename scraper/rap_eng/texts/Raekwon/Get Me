[Sample: (?)]
I start off snorting little tiny pinches
So that I know I won't get hooked
Not on no coke, you can't get hooked
My friends have been snorting 15 years, they ain't hooked

[Raekwon]
From the tone of the voice, it's moist and choice
A special, he shoot 'em in the face with them boy
Yo, from all them niggas off of Hoy Street, came this
Large nigga taking over parole
Crib all stretched out, bulletproof saunas
Furry minks, touching the ground, she slaughtered six shrinks
One of the primetime kings, all of the young niggas
Who lived it, will sit in the box and dream
He coppin' lots of things, he even got rasta connects
Now, he bling, if lord love me, he'll throw it up, all lovely
Open the shirt, all ugly
He kept the Purple Tape, hug me
Tell that nigga Chef, when that nigga get on, plug me
There it go, Barnaby Jones and Mugsy
Two wicked cops, try'nna get their names on the come up
Shit, do not fuck with me, I won't have it
If them niggas try to pull up, what's up, get me
