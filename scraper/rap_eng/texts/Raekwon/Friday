Friday nigga
Whats the word
You got something for me
I'mma see you in 2 seconds
Right, yo pull my Rover on the side
Right there police coming man
Heard me

[Verse 1]
Yo up in the game room 4 in the morning and it's storming and we blitzed
Just rocked another wig yeah we on it
God had blood on his sweat pants
The way the tech dance on a nigga face, son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga from outta town
A young mellow ally trying to run through
Hell, it's on called the dogs to get on him
And we caught him, only thing this nigga was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail, I used to play baseball with him
'Til son got largeâ€”bought a whale
Azure by the entrance, guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back in the Acura
Spectacular vic, he stackular
Seen a nigga gem-down, fresh haircut trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im
Shorty ain't looked he trying to get fly, my niggas ain't dived on him
Kaze had the Mac in the vest, the way he moving might be dressed
He made two rights nigga move left
Standing by the incinerator, thank God he a generator
I can tell, bought his lady suede gators
Yo now it's time to move, spin nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib, yup draped
We on the elevator baked, staring at the nigga chain shape
We looked at him, seen all crooked, then we flashed on him
He knew we was live, my man Boo spazzed on him
Pulled out, take off the wool, nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding, betta run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck, larger than fuck
Better kill me, all y'all niggas is butt, what spray it up
Tuck the chains in, Kaze shot him at point blank range then
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste, I can tell furniture fell out his face
Laced now it's a case
Threw up, vomit on my coat piece
Snatched all his ice now, Chrome T, boatin' off low-key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail, Mexicans surrounding the gods
Chill you bigga than the ocean, slow motion
Play it off no emotion but my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death, that's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year
Crack beers one nigga in the back washing off his track Airs
Don't take it serious, vivid flow luxurious
I'm hearing this'll, make a real nigga curious
Friday my day, chill Pop, leave 'em on the highway
Bet he won't never fly my way
