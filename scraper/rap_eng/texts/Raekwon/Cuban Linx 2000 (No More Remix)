[Intro: Raekwon (Ghostface Killah)]
(Yo, what up law, wassup, wassup baby? Talk to me)
Yo, Shorty yo, it ain't even like it's really, it's really, messing with me son
But it's messing with me, man, for real man
(Aight, but you know what? Don't even let it get to you
Like you told me, birds is birds
After you lovin 'em, they fly away, son)
They fly, yeah yeah, you're right, you're right
(KnowImean? It's like that man) Yeah
(Word up!)

[Raekwon]
One in the morning tryin to sneak in
Caught the weace and start beefin, I'm leavin
And leave, stop speakin yo, no static
Go get that shit up in the attic
That old shit look better, kept it so you have shit
The ice, take it off, no loss
Knew you was an Indian giver nigga
Besides, that's the way I floss, yea
I'm buggin now, actin like an old lady
It's real, a nigga got mines, she sleepin without pagin me

[Ruff Endz]
Baby, relax, sit back and chill (yeah)
Just give me a second
And let me tell you how I feel
Cause all around town you've been steppin' out
Runnin' your mouth about
What made you think I wouldn't find out?
Wasn't I there for you?
Truly cared for you
Maybe my love was just too good
Could've had it good, now the love is gone
And went back to your hood with the 54-11's on

[Hook: Ruff Endz]
Does he lace you with the finer things?
Does he make ya wanna scream his name?
Does he hit it from the front to back?
Did you let him break it down like that?
Should've told me the love was gone
Never thought that you'd do me wrong
Girl I though that your love was strong
Till I saw you with another man

[Chorus 2X: Ruff Endz]
No more shopping sprees
No more late night creeps
No more VIP's, no more dough
We can't even kick it no more

[Ruff Endz]
I saw you on the Ave' in the Nav'
In the backseat B's, spilling Henney in his lap
Thought it was me that you was all about
But I'm having doubts cause I see you tryna play me out
But when the brother called the crib with beef
Didn't I represent you when I caught him in the streets
So let me get the keys to Lex and no more checks
And no more hanging baguettes around your neck, babe

[Hook]

[Chorus 2X]

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Uh-uh
You heard that
That's right
Yo, yeah, come on
And that's a no-no
Yeah, eh yo, eh yo, eh yo, eh yo

[Ghostface Killah]
You met me with a big blow out
African bangel, left hand Gucci, ling braces on my ankle
At the shark bar we at Shaq shit
Ballplayer stats, 40 plus, son hit twenty-somethin baskets
Turn for a second, stop! Son caught my eye, yo 'vine!
Bet you out bag her on the first stop
Peace booby, love you beauty, rock yours truly
Ghostface and who is she? That's my girlfriend
I want you and your girl to grab me, Tonka's
Be careful boo, I got carrots on (Word!)
Carry on, so we stepped back to the bar
The disc jockey threw in the car
Toxi' seen me, so what time is it?
Your back was out, passin we bounced to the powder room
Beggin me, I fucked you for an hour in the room
And when we finished, you was on stuck
Jamal Arief came through, started dartin
And you jumped up in my man's truck

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
For real
Ghostface Killah, Ruff Endz
No doubt! Y'all know how we do
