"Guess who's the Black Trump" [Raekwon]

[Steele] (Raekwon)
I had to get some real professionals for the job, son
(Numerous cats) Word up
(That's right) Official niggas word up
(This is what you call ?) Straight blazin through what
Raise the roof is what we came to do (Like hash browns)
Blazin through, blazin through (Pass that African black gold over here)
Raise the roof is what we came to do
Blazin through, blazin through (You know how we rock)
Raise the roof is what we came to do (Smiff-N-Wess-N-Lex set up shop)

[Steele]
Attack mode, time to strike like a cobra
Poisonous venom into your system killin you slower
Than niggas with blowers to your jugular
My brother's keeper but I put my brother to sleep
If my brother try to creep up
You know my son, show respect when I'm rockin the podium
Steam-rollin on niggas, my team straight blowin em
Got em Throwin they Gunz In The Air like Onyx
Chef and Smiff-N-Wessun crime shit, New York's finest

[Raekwon]
Let me warn y'all killas upstairs
I seen all y'all, heavy like fuck, thinkin my niggas might flaw y'all
Blow ya ammo, Shallah seen the god fly commando
Handle, gun on my leg, blow his hand off
I'm lookin at you why, like "fuck, you probably think I'm high"
Seems luck, chain around my neck, bought it from E-gypt
Me what? Hennesy drink, mahogany guns, we treesed up
Come out your shirt, buckle knees-up
This Casablanca rap nigga throw some cheese up
Let's poly, slow-mo status, bring the keys up
Wonderin, runners is lookin mighty fees'd up
Right stupid, FBI sell em ? guns

[Tek]
Make this money, niggas hold up guns
Armed full of licks, plus your dick, drop your ones
Baby need new shoes and a outfit
I see you stick-up kids, you came wit the dick lick
You see my set of twin-hitmen from Bushwick?
Two chicks wit the twenty-two tecs, bitch
You heard about em
Now open up the circle so the dice can breathe
Pay you double, if you triple, if you push you pay me

[Hook]
Gotta poly wit ya crew to stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
If you step into the club wit your guns up
If the tension's on your mind then raise the roof up
You gotta keep it in the fam, stack ya loot up
Get your weight up, big up, pull ya boots up
When you step into the club wit ya guns up
If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Never before we came to raise the roof up
Raise the roof up, raise the roof up
Still in all we came to raise the roof up

[R] Minolta flash
[S] Gun in the stash
[T] Rollin for mo' hash
[R] Tek, why you slap fire out em, hold fast
[T] These niggas gotta pay the hard way
[All] Three the hard way
[R] Allah swingin on em like a San Diego Padre

[Steele]
You heard what the god say, let's start this
Professional marksman, swimmin like killa sharks
We lethal and heartless
On point like a dart, bitch
Bomb your camp if you want this
Connect wit convicts on some Don shit

[Tek]
And spread the camouflage cats to get the money in Stat
Go to war like Saadam if he pushes you that
Keep his movements discreet when he out in the streets
Had to stash built to high heat for those who creep

[Steele]
Ha, peep the ghetto bastards
Run in your crib like two masked men
I run wit a Tek, and we ain't askin, we blastin
Chef brought the extra cannon from Staten
Rhyme official live broadcastin, makin it happen

[Tek]
You gotta make power moves, black guns and cash rules
Hold my eight straight cuz I been payin dues
Wave king from way back tryin to make a mill stack
Miami money cats that leave you layin down flat

Chorus
*Replace "When you step into the club wit ya guns up"
W/ "When you layin in the cut wit ya guns tucked"*

*Steele chanting "raise the roof up*

[Raekwon]
It's on again
Word up, put your hands down
Word up, this shit is multi
Y'all gonna see it, word up
Smiff, Wess, Lex
*Steele chanting "the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire*
From the projects, phony projects
Next!
(We don't need no water, like the Cocoa B's burn)
(Gotta poly wit your crew to stack ya loot up)
(Get ya weight up, big up, pull ya boots up)
(When you step into the club wit the guns up)
(If the tension's on your mind, then raise the roof up)
