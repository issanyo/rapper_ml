[Intro: Canibus & Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah
Bar Exam 2, nigga
It's a motherfuckin' holiday, bitches
Bar Exam 2

[Verse 1: Canibus]
I landslide you to the lava below, gotta stance nigga flow
How many bars? How far can you go?
Only as far as the mind, Canibus and Royce 5'9"
Bar Exam 2, spit a rhyme
A miniature version of me told me he wanted to MC
I told him, "Be careful who you be."
He said, "I'ma just be me." I said, "Yeah, I see
But you don't understand what I really mean"
Look at the manifest list, it got my name down
A bald head for the cool crown, how you like me now?
I terrorize rap music
What manner of creature could do this? Canibus, stupid
Retarded, autistic artists, one click, perfects target
Staff Sergeant Canibus talkin', I would not let off the gas
Traverse it through San Stone's past
The Ripper spills whiskey from a flask

[Verse 2: Elzhi]
Yeah, I toke green, blowin' out smoke screens
Poke queens, leave them with soaked jeans
You're the definition of what "joke" mean
I'm star status, like glowin' lights throughout the far strato-
Sphere, it's clear who repertoire that is
Pursue whites and fuck a shoe price, my cheese outgrew mice
I'm too nice, cut through slice, I'm seein' you twice
The lead pacer, been makin' moves like Speed Racer
Indeed tracin' a line that fucks with your mind like a weed lacer
Try and boast, ain't lyin' close, so what I diagnose
I could fry and roast any guy till they applyin' ghost
Pee on peons beyond eons
Till there's neon Klingons, close encounter of the three kinds
You may fall, I'm AWOL, my heaters will spray y'all
And put you in a hole like Robert Peter to pay Paul
I could give a fuck, got a flow to leave a river stuck
You hear deeper lines, keep a nine near the liver tucked

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, Osama McCain, you climb in this ring
Rhyming with Obama the king
End up on the bottom of the things
Living inside of ominous springs, I'm in a dream
I spit the only kind of sickness that vomiting brings
That means I'm ill/sick, and plus I'm real, bitch
I should've played Hancock instead of Will Smith
'Cause I'm drunk, the flyer, I'm the super hero
Minus all the chump attire, and I bleed hardly
Tell your idol his times up and he's barbe-
Cue, every rhyme lined up like Steve Harvey's do
From the pies to the brick man
Niggas couldn't follow in my steps 'less I died in some quicksand
So come and see a nigga burn a show and give me a hand
Before I give you the fist like a germaphobe
And you probably too scary to scuffle
If you ain't hit a nigga until you buried your knuckles
I got a hundred round drum, I shoot the first thirty
To kill everybody that trash your hook up
Category blast the butcher, empty the clip
Just to make that 70 show like Ashton Lutcher
Nigga you at war with sharks, the government team
Will leave you airless like Jordan Sparks or a motherless queen
We put it on y'all, tape a nigga phone call
Sell it to the net for a phone card
Then use it to phone y'all mommas, I throw you niggas a bone
And then I bury the drama in a bone yard
The flow's in prime, I got more plastic on me
Than all of Hugh Hefner's hoes combined
My niggas got GTs and shit, yeah, I know mini Coopers
While you niggas rolling around in them Mini Coopers
I'm the shit, for real, y'all niggas mini-poopers
Drunk, wildin, commiting vodka and Henny bloopers
Who could give a nigga the Snoop foot?
Stretch him out on the floor like the Manut look
You shook, nigga, I'm like the crew cook
I put a price on the whip, and I'm like the blue book
With an appetite for destruction with the greed stigma
Explains my past and adds to my enigma
If it's digital or analog
Bar Exam 2 is the present, the distributor is Santa Claus
