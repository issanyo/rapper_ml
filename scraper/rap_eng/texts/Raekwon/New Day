[Verse 1: Raekwon]
What's good scientist? talk to me kid, how's life working?
Keep your money up dead killers murking niggas
I'm strong been through mountains, I'm like Martin, one Spartan
Guaranteed to blow up your start week
My measurements is ordinance, little bit flashy
Nah, I'm lying I'm all cashmere with glasses
Yeah I'm flashy, don't come through fronting this shit
Light a whole big blunt to this shit
We sit around the table here it goes
It's yours, mines, his, hers, what? This what it does
Just keep it in the family, all love
Lets put the plugs together and cake up, build up the buzz
I write for real niggas who down, bring your hound with you
Throw em a jewel with meat on it, now did you
Analyze it like a 27 inch, give me the wrench
So we can throw a niggas some heroin and Jane and Finch

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch I'm from the ski mask school house
Where life stay complicated, intoxicated and gooned out
And niggas ain't graduated but they can relate with they tool belt
That 2 for 10 crack stems, needles and spoons out
Ooh I need some paper, ooh my fingers itching
I wish that Santa Claus would put a brick under my tree for Christmas
A new wig for my bitch and two choppers off in my stocking
Baking soda yola'n locking, you cop then drop the deposit
Signed my life right on the dotted line, wrote it in blood
Got my uncle wiping down my tires, sold em a dub
Niggas know I rap for most of my days, I rap with my plug
Before I see my platinum album, I see my day with the judge, fuck it
When I die tell my mama I'm in the mafia
Equadorian chick 'bout to scoop me up from LaGuardia
A party you wanna stop but you can't give up the sport
Little stove pyrex and fork, shouts to East New York, nigga
