[Intro: Raekwon]

Yah, uh uh good
Thats that shit right there, thats how its going down

[Verse 1: Raekwon]

We in the jumbos, in the 2500 Benzes in dumbos
Leather pants, Mutombo [?], ya'll check the gums yo
I'll appreciate patriarchs and [?], computers and whizzes
In lizard jackets and Jacobs
Die a hundred deaths take something of mine
Onion stretched, vice grips twisting ya legs
I roll with my brothers in anarchy, throw me the car key
Let me bombard he, little ass chain, only a car thief
Moving like the lords, what up?
Blow a Dutch dude
Parley with the pushers who wear Clarks and Bucks
But still a Gucci slayer, word to my five year old
Salute me baby, daddy got money we blowin' out in Haiti lady
Choppers, Bulgari watches, rums, and copper
Blue wraith with a steel face, yah I'm a popper
Hundred niggas with me, some guns hittin' in Bentleys
Rock Csonka shirts baggin' bitches move about discretely
[?] ready to fight but it's a Monday
Everybody dressin' it up, let's flip the runway
Tax time, seein' 'em run through, yo that's mine
[?] daddy whatever baby bag me

[Verse 2: Gwen Guthrie]

Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to yo
