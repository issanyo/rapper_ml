Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low
Now

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Put your, put your back in it
Put your, put your, put your back in it now
Put your, put your back in it
Put your, put your, put your back in it now
Put your, put your, put your, put your
Put your, put your, put your back in it

Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low
Now

Let your legs spread wide and your head down low

Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low
