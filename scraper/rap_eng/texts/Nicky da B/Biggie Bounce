[Verse 1]
She gotta face on her like Lisa Ray
Get the players club with the Frito-Lay
Nigga try me wrong it's gon' be your day
Valet Porsche, shoulda seen they face
Did one for magic city
Them hoes shakin' ass and titties
Cough syrup in my cup oh it's sticky
Erybody in the club getting tipsy

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Make it clap, make it clap

[Verse 2]
Look, I walked in man girl and her friend
Kissing on each other, hell yeah they going in
Before I pulled out man your bitch hoped in
'Bout to take 'em to the house 'cause the party never end uh
Then get some Ciroc and I mix it up
Stick a molly on the table then she licks it up
Throw the ones off in the air then she picks it up
I'mma party all night 'cause I'm twisted up

[Bridge]
Bend over, bend your back, work your back
Work your back, bend over, work your back
Work your back, work your back
Bend over, work your back, work your back, work your back
Bend over, work your back, work your back

[Verse 3]
Shorty how you act, for a stack, for a stack
And make it clap, make it clap
Shake it harder, put your name in my raps
Now I really wanna know what Brittany 'bout
Is she in the club tell her pull her titties out
She don't ever come out, she be in the house
Take the pussy to the vet, knock the kitty out
