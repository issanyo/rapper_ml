(Feat. Nicky Da B)

Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low
Now

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Release it-go, attack the floor
And work it low
Express yourself, release it-go, attack the floor
And work it low

Express yourself, express yourself, express yourself
Put your, put your back in the
Put your, put your, put your back in the .in the nah
Put your, put your, put your back in the .in the nah
Put your, put your, put your, put your
Put your back in the .in the nah
Drop the floor

Get you, get you, get you, get you, get low
Now

Legs spread wide and your head down low
Take your .miss your 
Rock your, rock you, rock your
...

Shake the. shake the., shake the 
The .the . put your god now

4 x
Express yourself, release the glow, attack the floor
And work it low

...

And they mad 'cause I'm hot and they wish they was
They be hatin on my name but my piece they love
They be mad 'cause I'm hot and they wish they was
They be hatin on my name but my piece they love

Spread your legs, watch your back, go up and down and make it clap x2
Spread your legs, now watch your back, go up and down and make it clap x4
Ma-ma-ma-make it clap-clap
