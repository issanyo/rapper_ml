[Intro]
Christian Louboutins on her toes
With some coke backed up in her nose
I'm tryna pull up in the drop dead Tesla Rose
Sloppy the toppy with no Travis Scotty
No one gotta know
Bitch keep it on the low
L-O-W
Some bitches switching bodies
Call it Captain Ginyu
Keep it on the low
L-O-W
Said keep it on the low
L-O-W

[Verse]
Ski, Ski, Ski
Ski Mask be messy
Leavin' cumstains on her dresses
No sex, bitch I only want the neck, bitch
Playin' with them bricks, call it Tetris
Ski Mask slide on the weekend
On the weekend, I goes deep in, ski, ski
Niggas be surprised at my flow, though
They like, "How you switch it up?", I can't tell you
Hah, hurry to the money like I ran out the meeting
I cook it, I cook it, I cook it, cook it like Anita
All of my seniors hitting those bells like a teacher
Nigga, ricky that pussy, come and I bless it like a preacher
I got the hand, I got the (??)
And I will (??) like the (??)
Got more bars than the bleachers, don't see how you can't see us, bitch
Don't see how you can't see us
Don't see how you can't see us
