[Intro]
La-la-la (Huh)
La-la-la-la (Huh)
La-la-a, la-la-la
Oh my god, Ronny!
Stupid

[Verse 1]
Like a Quarter Pounder, I found her
She want a bite, dick game Ned Flanders
She said that, really nice
With my ice, I drown her
I found her soul in the night
She's a salamander, cold-blooded the type

[Chorus]
Yuh! This ain't that, bitch (Yuh!), that ain't this (Yuh!), yuh (Yuh!)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh!), that ain't this (Yuh!), yuh (Water!)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh!), that ain't this (Yuh!), yuh (Bitch!)
Is that him that's talking shit?
Bend him like a brim (Yuh!)

[Verse 2]
I know she gon' swallow like the bitch can't swim, yuh!
Hit her with a follow and the bitch gain ten, yuh!
Who the fuck the reaper? Fuck that nigga named Grim yuh!
I am at war with light inside the darkness of the den, yuh!
I'm a god but I'm still praising God, too
Know a nigga know dogs, sell dog food
Know my game on point, no harpoon
Know a nigga said I'm fry, so I told 'em get fist
'Cause these niggas too old, too broke too (Ayy, ayy)
Cut em' off my frequency, no Pro Tools (Ayy)
Blue cheese and blue jeans and you know they're Balmains
So they come with the wrinkles like a Pug do (Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus]
Yuh! This ain't that, bitch, that ain't this, yuh!
This ain't that, bitch (Yeah!), that ain't this, yuh! (Woo!)
This ain't that, bitch (Ha-ah!), that ain't this, yuh! (Bitch!)
Is that him that's talking shit?
Bend him like a brim (Let's go!), yuh!

[Verse 3]
Gucci on my body feel like water, I can't swim (Yuh!)
So I bought a Gucci rubber ducky with the fins (Yuh!)
When I was a youngin', hated home, I was 10 (Yuh!)
Told my Dad, "I'm selling molly," ninth grade in (Yuh!)
Yeah now I'm inside of my mind
It is very black and white, no mime
I put diamonds up on my time, mmm
Laid back sipping Fiji with the lime, do
She an animal, eat me like bamboo
Young nigga, and I'm sly like Cantu

[Chorus]
Yuh! This ain't that, bitch (Yuh!), that ain't this (Yuh!), yuh (Bitch!)
This ain't that, bitch (Yuh!), that ain't this, yuh (Woo!)
This ain't that, bitch, that ain't this, yuh (Water!)
This that him that's talking shit (Bitch!)
Bend him like a brim (Bitch!), yuh!

[Outro]
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
