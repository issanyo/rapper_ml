Captain Crunch presents

[Verse 1: Denzel Curry]
Free Nell, Free Slikk
Back in the day when a nigga trip six
Now a nigga trip scene
On the Internet tip
I talk about the internet chick
Let me get back on topic
On how Curry was the top pick
To hold the whole sun in his hands till he drops hot shit
I got the game interlocked swift in a box sucked in
'Cause I'm thinking outside of it
That's how I got a house and a whip
Some niggas shout fuck for the cream
Floss like a river at the dentist
Lifestyle imaginary who will fuck your image
All you niggas only in it for the motherfucking scrimmage
Put that on lotto mane
Why all them niggas all sound the same
Like pinky you better use your brain
Focus on the past only make you lame
Black metal jackets full metal jackets
Fucking with the kilo like Allen I'm blasting
Thinking about my passion I'm sick of being passive
Pastor you ain't even got the fucking answers
Kanye West it, Smith & Wesson
Blasting on these motherfuckers ducking like aflac
Here's to the other slave running for Aztec
On acid fucking my heart no batches

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hahahaha
Thank you, Curry
Yuh, yuh
Like a truck with me
Do a buck fifty
If she fuck with me
Then she stuck with me
What you doing I'm busting busting busting busting busting I'm busting
Pussy nigga cross eyed sipping on tussin'
Got a new bitch, sound like Siri, she Russian
She tried to suck and suck my dick just like a musket
You're my whore, ayy, you're my whore, ayy
Diamonds they got acne blackheads I'm on par
I don't need the car, I got face card, ayy
Diamonds walk it out up on your boulevard
Okay, like your bitch be killing me
Said that she feeling me
Jet like I'm big that bitch into me, mmm
Pockets Yo Gotti, they hopped in the Mase'
My chain is a sin cuz it's killing me, ayy
My nigga Xen got the pistol piece
My nigga Curry don't keep the peace, uhh
This is the gift that I give to ye, uhh
Drown in designer my necklace piece bitch

[Verse 3: Craig Xen]
Niggas in the cut who head fucked ay, AY, AY, AY, AY!
Bitch I do this for my niggas in the cut
Who head fucked up
Ain't never had to clutch
A pistol we'll stomp
That nigga will cut
Straight through his jugular
They drag him through that mud
Burn his body up
My niggas don't move in silence
We in the venue we riot
Fuck nigga need I remind you
Xen ain't no wavy I'm virus
Spreading the choas so layup and stay out the Lambo you about to get tucked
Talking and bumping them guns
I'm coming in coming you pussy get fucked
Nigga know that
If and when your pistol loaded
You can never kill a soldier
If it ain't his time to go yet
Now let that simmer in
Cuz I been planning it
Who trying to bring Xen in
But they just can't finish him
Shoutout to my brothers who gonna fight for they vision
They gotta fight to stay alive in this life we living
Damn
