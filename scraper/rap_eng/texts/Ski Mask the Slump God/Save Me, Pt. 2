[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yeah, ayy
Hold on, babe
(The Pharmacy)
Yeah, ayy
Hold on, babe
Yeah, ayy
Hold on, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nosehair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?

[Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, thinkin' bout it lately
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Sons, daughters, wives, lives all lost in the name that love that died
Mary Jane replacement for any bitch that kill my vibe
I'm hot as fuck like cast a spell
The village people couldn't even burn me alive
Bad habits, live fast, die young, fully aware of the power inside
Don't really be going outside
Got my own amenities on my side
You know that every club won't let me inside (Hol-up, ayy)
Like Pinocchio can never tell a lie
And yes I know cause when I look up in your eyes
Déjà Vu who is this they feelin' every time?
That look you give me every time I'm high

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nose hair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?

[Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, thinkin' bout it lately
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Guess I'm an addict 'cause I'm at it again (Oh, oh)
I tried to run, but babe I'm on the southwest
(Southwest, yeah-yea-ayy)
Baby don't you lie to me
(Don't you lie to me, hold on, babe)
You take all the time you need (Yeah-yea-ayy, hold on)
It feels good but it's killing me softly
(Yeah-yea-ayy, hold on, babe Killing me softly)
Is there anything I can do for you to love me?
(Yeah-yea-ayy, hold on, babe)
I been feelin' lone-lonely
(Yeah-yea-ayy, hold on, babe)
I don't think I'll change one day

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Got some habits, I can't keep them
The same ones that made you hate me
Ho-oh, smokin' potent, high as nose hair
If I were to get lost, bitch would you save me?

[Chorus: Austin Lam & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby would you save me?
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Baby would you save me?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Been thinkin' bout it lately
Oh, baby, baby, baby
