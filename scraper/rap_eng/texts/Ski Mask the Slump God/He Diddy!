[Intro]
Huh, ding, ding, ding
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding
Water!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Goodbye everyone, I'll remember you all in therapy
Haha, ahem
Playtime's over, I hate windows, I hate windows
Yuh, yerr!

[Verse]
Worth more than a Birkin, and that is for certain
Butterscotch caramel, color the curtains
You might need a recipe, this not a burger
The sauce that I'm dishing out so damn unheard of
Your girl gonna suck like a octopus tentacle
Her mouth and leeches just do something identical
Trappin’ off the digital, look for a signal
Dodging all the police, call ‘em piggies like a pinky toe
Sipping muddy lean up outta Big Gulp cup
Give no fucks, I get slump
Higher than the price of gas, to fill a Ford truck
Spitting harder than Daffy Duck, tryna get buck
Captain K'nuckles type, fuck or no bluff
She give suck at the Starbucks
Just like some velcro, her mouth got me stuck
Pimp cup sucks (yuh), sip a pint of-

[Chorus]
Feel like Joker, I'm purging the city, he Diddy
I beat up the kitty, he Diddy
He stack up the benjis
He Diddy, he Diddy, he Diddy
But his name not Diddy
I beat up the kitty, he Diddy
I'm purging the city, he Diddy
I stack up the benjis
He Diddy, he Diddy, he Diddy
But his name not Diddy
