[Verse 1: TC]
We up in this bitch
Mad At Me Cause I'm Actually Getting Lit
I'm A Problem That You Niggas Can't Fix
We Go Crazy Cause We On Some Shit
We Keeping It Hot For North Carolina
From NC All the way To Fucking China
Singing "Panda" But Ain't Rocking No Designer
You Looking Stupid Talking Bout' I Can't Find her
She's Rocking With me oh well
She's Ringing My Bells
I'm powerful like Cell
Don't Fuck With that Boy Tyrel
Try To Jugg on Me and you'll fail
Break that Pussy up like glass and I like the way she yell
And I'm leaving you niggas hanging like rails
She turning me on like the laptop Dell
(WOO!) Nigga I'm Flexing
I'm that nigga she's texting
You're The Only one that's stressing
You're the Curse And I'm blessing (X2)


[Chorus: Lil Flexxxico]
Jugg Season little nigga better run that shit
Got the block hotter than my mother fucking bitch
When we out on these streets gotta hit them licks
Jugg Season little nigga better run that shit
Jugg Season little nigga better run that shit better run that shit, Jugg Season little nigga better run that shit better run that shit

[Verse 2: 4our2wenty]
Juggin Season Robbin Season

I don’t care about no hoe I fuck a bitch and then I’m gone
Fuck your bitch yeah to my song then I buy that bitch a thong
I’m just trying to get rich and put my family on
Ahhhh I could give a fuck about a hater
I got no problems jugging for paper
My whole family some paper chasers
Pop used to be a dope dealer then I he just moving patients
Big Bro locked up in the cell so I’m patiently waiting
Got the loudest loud in Durham so big blunt shit I be facing
In my sonata I’m racing I don’t fuck with none of that white
But I’m not racist money the only thing I’m chasing

[Chorus]
