[Verse 1]
...
Purple drank, I'm pourin'
Curry in the Kitchen like cuu I'm scorin'

[Hook]
I just put Chanel on your main bitch, hol up
I just put Chanel on your main bitch, yuh
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hit that bitch right in the bank
Little boy what is your rank?
Your face not good in the hood
Trade me an L bitch I can't
She fuck on me, suck on me, oh wee like yuh
They wanna turn up the speed
They like "Ski, where is X?"
He somewhere fuckin' your ex
Chain, ring, bling shinin' yellow like piss
Had to take a cigarette break I'm pissed
Brace face, gimme motor mouth, no kiss
What a pack of bezels and thats on my wrist
Diamonds in my earrings lookin' like a weasel fist
Dancin' in that pussy, Gangnam Style, I'm lit
I'm Ash Ketchum, and I choose your clit
Murder that pussy, I'm Jason Voorhees, bitch

[Hook]
I just put Chanel on your main bitch, hol up
I just put Chanel on your main bitch, yuh
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel
Chanel, Chanel, yeah
