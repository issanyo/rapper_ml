[Intro: Nell & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yeah, nigga
Y'all know what it is, bitch
Ayy, ayy ayy ayy, ayy
DJ Patt on the beat
We deep 400 nigga
Captain Crunch presents
Your aunty climbed this way

[Chorus: Nell]
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
Quick to break your ass down, nigga
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
We break your ass, breaker, breaker
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
Quick to break your ass down, nigga
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
We break your ass, breaker, breaker

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy!
Give me the face, mm
Top on my top like a tape, mm
I put my dick in the bank, mm
Diamonds be wet like a sank, mm
Like this bitch pussy, spank on that pussy
Now it be pink like a mink
How is your cookie?
I think it sweet, just like a damn sugarcane
All of my niggas got pieces like Reese's
His main bitch, I gave her fake name
All of my niggas be quicker than uber
They pull up in front of your face
Lean margherita for your senorita
She sucking my sauce in a Wraith

[Verse 2: DirtyFaceSmook]
Sick, sick sock, got a brand new Glock
Honestly I can't wait to use that shit

[Verse 3: Nell]

[Chorus: Nell]
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
Quick to break your ass down, nigga
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
We break your ass, breaker, breaker
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
Quick to break your ass down, nigga
Breaker breaker, we come through deep
And make you meet the fucking Undertaker
We break your ass, breaker, breaker
