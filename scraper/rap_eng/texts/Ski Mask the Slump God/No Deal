[Intro: K$upreme & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hahaha, no deal
Haha, busta had no deal (hahahaa, yeah)
Had no chillz (yes, yah)
Okay, yup, okay, yup
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, okay

[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God & K$upreme]
Breast milk, like I drop milk
Pull up in the bat, oh, yeah Mobile
Put the nigga so ill, like roadkill
Shoutout nigga 'preme tho, got no deal
Bust down my wrist, I got no deal
Shoutout to Boat, for the boy you know I kill
Glock on my hip, that's a big steel
Send my young nigga go do a drill
Beat up the pot, I ain't cooking no oatmeal
These niggas flaggin', football drill
Out of Neiman Marcus spent a big bill
Feeling like a carcass, that boy killed
Diamonds out the water, like they grew gills
So I'm gon' float yeah, like Root Beer
Bout to catch a body, get a tat tear
Boss like Ross but I, don't eat pears

[Verse 1: K$upreme]
Can't have one bitch I need two pair
Walk inside Prada I need me like two pairs
Drip on that nigga, that young nigga too rare
Fucking that bitch like a motherfucking bear
Broke that bitch back and I yank at her hair
Smoking Gelato, put dope in the air
I spent three bands on a new Moncler
Don't fuck with these niggas, these niggas be squares
Too many bands, I'ma flex on these niggas
Eight in the wok, yeah I don't drink no liquor
Hop out the whip, got Chanel on my slipper
Number Nine on my shirt and that Vlone my zipper
She suck on my dick then yo' lame ass kiss her
Whipping up dope, they call me that mixer
My young nigga shoot shit like Derek Fisher
Bust on that nigga just like a blister

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bust on that bitch just like I am a blister
Can't steal my sauce I pull up like: "Hey Mister!"
Fucked on your bitch and I know that you kissed her
Then float away in the whip like a whisker
Handle all my liquor, if she can't, I'ma diss her
That nigga be pussy, if I punch, call it fist her
Hold up, wait a minute my nigga, 'cause now my wrist hurt
Yellow coat, with the yellow feathers like I'm Big Bird
You heard, like Chris I tuck her, she ride like trucker
And the way that her pussy slides, so damn good
That I just said "Can't Believe That It's Not Butter!"
Hate these niggas like I'm Uncle Ruckus
Like a young wild child, cause too much ruckus
Take a look at my file, make too much buckets
Pistol on me like a collared shirt, had to just tuck it

[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God & K$upreme]
Breast milk, like I drop milk
Pull up in the bat, oh yeah Mobile
Put the nigga so ill, like roadkill
Shoutout nigga 'preme tho, got no deal
Bust down my wrist, I got no deal
Shoutout to Boat you know for the boy I kill
Glock on my hip, that's a big steel
Send my young nigga go do a drill
Beat up the pot, I ain't cooking no oatmeal
These niggas flaggin', football drill
Out of Neiman Marcus spent a big bill
Feeling like a carcass, that boy killed
Diamonds out the water, like they grew gills
So I'm gon' float yeah, like Root Beer
Bout to catch a body, get a tat tear
Boss like Ross but I don't eat pears
