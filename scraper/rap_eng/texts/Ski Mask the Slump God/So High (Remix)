[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Soar high
How hi-igh? (So high)
A Lau on the beat!
Let me know, so high
You're so high
Let me know, how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Flyboy Tarantino]
We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah (yahh), yah

[Verse 1: Flyboy Tarantino with Kin$oul]
I can tell this world ain't meant for me (me)
Feel my energy from here 'cause I can't breathe (breathe)
I really wanna go but I can't leave (leave)
Keep a nigga up then I'ma lose it (lose it)
Where'd my feelings go? (feelings go?)
Niggas say they feel me but they really don't (really don't)
And since they took my brother, I can't trust a soul (oh)
Got some broken shoulders, now a broken soul
Off these drugs, I'm hopin' I don't overdose

[Bridge: Kin$oul]
We can go hi-igh
We can soar how high? (how high?)
Let you know how high (how high?)
If you hit my phone, yeah-yeah (yeah-yeah, If you hit my phone)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah, yah

[Refrain: Kin$oul]
It's so high, can you fly away? (Fly away)
Ohh, yeah, you ran outta space like a cocoon (Feelin' out of space)
How you ride that with your bae (With your bae)
Don't move, let the drugs take it away (Take it away)
It's so high, can you fly away? (Fly away)
Ohh, yeah, you ran outta space like a cocoon (Feelin' out of space)
How you ride that with your bae (With your bae)
Don't move, let the drugs take it away (Take it away)

[Segue: Kin$oul]
So high, you can make out with the sky (Sky)
So high, probably thinkin' that you fly (That you fly)
So high, you can make out with the sky (Sky)
So high, probably thinkin' that you fly (That you fly)

[Break: Kin$oul]
Ooh (Ooh), so high
Ooh (Ooh), so high
Ooh (Ooh), so high (Huh? I'm so high)

Ooh, got you feelin' so high

[Refrain: Kin$oul]
It's so high, can you fly away? (Fly away)

Don't move, let the drugs take it away (Take it away, ooh)
It's so high, can you fly away? (Fly away)
Ohh, yeah, you ran outta space like a cocoon (Feelin' out of space)
How you ride that with your bae (With your bae)
Don't move, let the drugs take it away (Take it away)
