[Intro]
Aye, Ski
Ski, Aye
Get it, get it

[Chorus]
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous lookin' like an orgy
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
I'm so gorgeous ridin' round in Porches

[Verse 1]
Malcom in the Middle of her titties while they jiggle (jiggle)
Lookin' like a riddle, play that pussy like a fiddle (fiddle)
And my niggas got a little white like Stuart Little (little)
She just like to sniff it, pop that pussy like a Skittle (Skittle)
Ridin' round Broward with a cherry bomb, ayy (boom)
Smokin' on loud like a car alarm ayy
Communication pussy like to wine and dine, ayy (aye)
Peppermint my primo like a Taliban, ayy

[Chorus]
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous (aye) (get it)
I'm so gorgeous lookin' like an orgy (aye)
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous (aye) (get it)
I'm so gorgeous ridin' round in Porsches (hoo)

[Verse 2]
Aye, a nigga got sauce like tartar (what?)
Had to switch it up like the border (what?)
Coach in that position call me Carter (okay)
Lookin' better than any fuck-nigga doin' it (okay)
My bitch's ass soft like a crumpet (crumpet)
Gold on me lookin' like a trumpet (trumpet)
Very Rare them niggas you don't fuck with
Pull up in the (pop pop pop) bitch (pow, pow, pow)
