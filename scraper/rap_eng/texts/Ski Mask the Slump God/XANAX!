[Intro]
Ch ch ch, ah ah ah

Hea
Yeah, Huh
Bitch, shine, shine

[Verse 1]
I just might think I'm a comet
Your nigga lame, I might vomit
My bullets want your brains like zombie
Your bitch look like moose, Abercrombie
She gon' buss it, double doors
Charlie's Angels, Demi Moore
Metro Boomin want some more
Whistle on that pussy bonjour
Pussy like a trigger, I'mma buss it
I pull up, she wet as I touch it
My dick a banana, she mush it
Just like the soda, she Crush it
I got a bitch and she Russian
Just like the couch, she got cushion
Hundred band, I need the money
Run it up, rob him in public
Hundreds please
No crease
Eat on my dick like some Applebee's
She chew on my dick like sunflower seeds
Without the twitter, she follow me
Symphony, Hennessy
I am not built but she feelin' me
I popped a Xan and it's killin' me
I popped a Xan and it's killin' me
Hundreds please
No crease
Eat on my dick like some Applebee's
She chew on my dick like sunflower seeds
Without the twitter, she follow me
Symphony, Hennessy
I am not Bill but she feelin' me
I popped a Xan and it's killin' me
I popped a Xan and it's killin' me
