[Intro: KiD TRUNKS]
Yuh, Lil bitch!

Gling, gling gling
Cris Dinero
Ayy Phone, pick up the phone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS & Robb Bank$]
Bitch I ball like Kobe (gling, hoo)
I don't fuck with police (gling, you dig)
Gas so green like Yoshi (cash, you dig)
Run to the money like Roshi (bitch, gling, gling)

[Bridge: Robb Bank$ & Ski Mask the Slump God]
Yeah (yuh), yeah (yuh), yeah (yuh), you dig
Yeah, yeah (set!), yeah (yuh), you dig (yuh, yuh)
3 gold rings on my Rosie (set!)
Balmain pocket full of posies (set!)
Yeah, your girlfriend wanna blow me  (set!)

Huh, yeah (yuh), yeah (yuh), yeah (yuh), you dig
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you dig (water, ay, ay, HUH)

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & KiD TRUNKS]
Gold same color as roses
My pockets are Pinocchio, poking
And that's why she tryna give face to me like a goatee
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
How do you know me? (gling, gling)

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Bitch I ball like Kobe
I don't fuck with police (gling, gling)
Gas so green like Yoshi
Run to the money like Roshi

[Verse 2: Robb Banks, Kid Trunks & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Do you wanna dick bitch, hold it (bitch)
Runnin' on my shit like horsie (set!)
Jewlery look so snowy (aye, aye)
And your money short just like Morty (aye, aye, aye)
You the girl type on the lowkey (set!)
I'm the mankind, Mick Foley (set!)
Me and Andrea, we whip the Fantasia (hoo)
You came back to sip, but you so sleep (hoo)
Y'all niggas ain't on shit, bitch
You was on IG with your stick
Lookin' for a friend, I'll leave if you want that spliff
Nigga now might just give me my cig
Man, phone smoking Tumblr pack in the vip
Not that I ran that back in 2012
Put one in your head like a thot
When I hit, she she said pause
I sent her back like she gave you hell (aye, aye)

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
She gon' trade me half a nut
Cumming on her lady lumps
Made my dick to stiffen up
Swallow, so she hiccing up
'Bout to tell her toughen up
When I'm in that shawty's guts
Like to disappear nigga I'm styling, et cetera
I am never letting up like tomato ketchup
Know you need to fess up, I want a Tesla
I'ma get a Tesla, numbers like professor
Make her learn a lesson, then I never mess up

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Bitch I ball like Kobe (gling, hoo)
I don't fuck with police (gling, you dig)
Gas so green like Yoshi (cash, you dig)
Run to the money like Roshe (bitch, gling, gling)
Bitch I ball like Kobe (gling, hoo)
I don't fuck with police (gling, you dig)
Gas so green like Yoshi (cash, you dig)
Run to the money like Roshe (bitch, gling, gling)
