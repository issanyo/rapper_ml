[Intro]
Yuh, oh, oh, oh (haha)
Okay like his mic-
You and your bitch
You and your bitch
Yeah, ayy!

[Verse]
You and yo' bitch kinda resemble Billy and Mandy
My bitch like Sandy
'Cause of the cheeks
Rode on my dick and said "It was so dandy"
Yippee ki-yay
I heard Freddie don't fuck with the feds
Yellow bitches on me like Lemonhead
Run up my sack like Ed and Edd and Eddy
Red and black sweater like my name is Freddy
Color spaghetti
Eyes so messy, pico khaki
Never lackin', keep that .30 in my jacket (a-a-ay-a-a-a-ay)
Look at the diamonds, they on hush mode (hush mode)
'Cause I bought diamonds for they ex hoe (ex hoe)
They be so clear and so see through (see through)
Like a nigga lookin' through the peephole (oh)
I just send them "XD rawr"
When I be texting your whore
Look at candy paint on car
It's brown like the Noah's Ark (water)
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean
And put a nigga on game like Atari (put a nigga on game)
Know how a nigga rockin' like guitar (know how a nigga rockin')
What I'm smoking smellin' like a fart (what I'm smoking smellin' like a)
Like Hercules, strong on these bitches, they back on knees (they back on knees)
Back in that bitch like, "What's happening?" (What's happening?)
Jump in that pussy like trampoline (trampoline)
When I hit it I'm just practicing
Made that pussy sound like mac and cheese
They be like, "Ski, you be snappening"
Teach me the ways of the saucin' king, hah (okay, ayy)

[Chours]
What you know?
What you know? (what you know?)
I've been doing drugs [?] from Mexico
What you know?
What you know?
I put peacock feathers on my new peacoat
What you know?
What you know?
