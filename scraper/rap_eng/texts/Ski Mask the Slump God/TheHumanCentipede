[Pre-Chorus]
Drop my top
Said I feel like J.F. Kennedy
She checking out my skin
Like I've got leprosy
Hamurai 'round me like I caught a fuckin' felony
Sittin' nosebleeds like a coke key
Eat on that bitch like some pork and rinds
Brought my dog with me adventure time
I put some lean in that lemon-lime
I got the sauce taste like lemon-lime

[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Kuzco Emperor's New Groove flow
Wet paint blue like Newport
Lilo and Stitch my rental
Skrt that bitch like a benzo
I just wanna hit a motherfucker with the stick
Body Harlem shaking, buddy lit him like a Bic
Riding on a lion 'cause I live in Skyrim
3 point jump shot, ballin' no rim
Uh- huh like swish, swish, swish
Diamonds on (sushi!)
Swim, swim, swim
Shittin' on em
Look at it, Look at it, Look at it
Look at it, Diamonds on
Swim, swim, swim, swim

[Chorus]
Shittin' on you niggas I'm the fuckin' human centipede
Shittin' on you like a baby centipede
Shittin' on you niggas I'm the fuckin' human centipede
Shittin' on you like a baby centipede
Spittin' on the pussy like I stutter or I can't read
And I'm trying to say the name Penelope
Shittin' on you niggas I'm the fuckin' human centipede
Shittin' on you like a baby centipede uh

[Verse 2]
Wrist cold, got a runny nose
Always come back like a boomerang
Stub on that pussy just like it my toe
Not off a pill, King of the Hill, just like I'm with it
Nitty-gritty, my bitch pretty
Your bitch a Squidbilly
Captain K'nuckles, belt buckle
Diamond be healthy like sugar-free
That mean they hittin', just they Booker T
Tell me who really tryna fuck with me
