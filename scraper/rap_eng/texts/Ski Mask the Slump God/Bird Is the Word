[Intro]
Huh, yuh, yuh, huh
I think outside the box
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
Huh, the bird is the word
Flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
(Water) I think outside the
Ayy, ayy ayy ayy ayy
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh
Let me give it to 'em
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh, ayy
Wet (you ready?), Fugi (you ready?)
Okay, okay, ayy

[Chorus]
Flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' that bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, I'm flippin' the bird
I think outside the box

Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds

Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
I think outside, I think outside

[Verse 1]
You sweet like cannoli or maybe Fruit Roll-Up
My pockets allergic, that why they is swollen
'Cause money's tucked in 'em, I just might go bowling
I think outside the box
My dick get a ollie when she ride like trolley
And all that she off is water mixed with molly
I just want a cracker like parrot named Polly
I think outside the box
My flow crazy like a Crock-Pot
Yours is uneven like rock tops
Frequently want suck my cock, top
I'm gonna water her crops
You can catch me flippin' the bird off to my grandpa
My pockets look like it got cancer
Gears of War I got a Retro Lancer
Put the bayonet in 'em he turned dancer
Callin' yo bitch my dear like her name Prancer
And I know every damn time she gon' answer
Answer, answer, answer

[Chorus]
Flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' that bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, I'm flippin' the bird
I think outside the box
I think outside the box
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I think outside the box (I'm gone)

[Bridge 2]
You is inside your box, you is inside your box
(Fuck, my head hurts)
Flippin' the bird, I think outside the box
(Fuck the bullshit, fuck the police, fuck, fuck 12)
I think outs-, side, side, I think outs-, side, side
I think out-, did you know? Hahaha, ayy!

[Verse 2]
There is a snake, It's on my clothes
Know that it Gucci, no ice cream cone
Like she ET, make her phone home
I think outside the box
Her mouth like some tentacles
Suction cupping all up on my genitals
'Cause your aesthetic wrinkled like testicles
Must've just got high off the pill that they sell at EDM rave festivals
My flow hit hard like they just took edibles
I done stepped up, I had to flex
How can you tell? Could be my new bitch or my ex
Don't skate my line 'cause I know that I'm next
I think outside the box
I'm at your bitch, you a T-Rex
I'm a Jamaican, I know that you vex
When in your bitch, raincoat on chest
That's how much she get wet, ayy

[Chorus]
Ayy, flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' that bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, I'm flippin' the bird
I think outside the box
I think outside the box
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the police are nerds
I think outside the box
Flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I'm flippin' the bird, the bird is the word
I think outside the box
