[Chorus: Sway Gold]
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
She on her knees, tryna charge me a fee
So I told that bitch, "please"
She could hop on this meat
100 degrees when I hop on the beat
I'm a p-i-m-p so she didn't charge me, ayy
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
If she suckin' this dick I ain't kissin' those lips
When she ain't gettin' dick, [?]
Like a Krabby Patty how I'm flippin' yo' bitch
Get yo' girl moanin', that's how I drop a diss, ayy
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
She on her knees, tryna charge me a fee
So I told that bitch, "please"
She could hop on this meat
100 degrees when I hop on the beat
I'm a p-i-m-p so she didn't charge me, ayy
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
If she suckin' this dick I ain't kissin' those lips
When she ain't gettin' dick, [?]
Like a Krabby Patty how I'm flippin' yo' bitch
Get yo' girl moanin', that's how I drop a diss, ayy

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Pew pew, pew, pew, pew
Hahaha, ayy, Ski, bitch
My bitch, splash, ayy
Fendi, dash, ayy
Tokyo, okay
Bitches on my dick, okay
Damn my bitch look pissed, okay
Tell my wrist to sit, okay
My wrist threw a fit, okay
Wrist, whip, chain, piss
Skin tone gold like she keepin' no lint
And she give me face like mace, no drink
Gump, Forrest in that pussy, I'm slump
Bitch suck all my energy, tired to even cum
[?] like Nick Cannon on a drum
Pum, pum, pew, pew
Cash, blue, hunnids, eww
Beam me up, Scotty, hey
Beam me up, Scotty, hey
Beam me up, Scotty, hey
Beam me up, okay
√Åndale, I can't wait
Pull up on a pussy like, ayy, ayy
Bitches quick, my bitch pissed
Till I give her dick she like, yay, yay
Worried 'bout me, nigga yo' bitch mine
And I'm on her ass like the true religious sign
Probably sign yo' bitch if you come here actin' kind
Look at my wrist, Ed Hardy for the time

[Chorus: Sway Gold]
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
She on her knees, tryna charge me a fee
So I told that bitch, "please"
She could hop on this meat
100 degrees when I hop on the beat
I'm a p-i-m-p so she didn't charge me, ayy
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
If she suckin' this dick I ain't kissin' those lips
When she ain't gettin' dick, [?]
Like a Krabby Patty how I'm flippin' yo' bitch
Get yo' girl moanin', that's how I drop a diss, ayy

[Verse 2: Sway Gold]
Ooh, I'm passin' a bitch
My niggas gon' train it, we call it assist
It was easy as learning my ABCs
When I gave her the D, I'm puffin' on that E
She kept on suckin' while I went to sleep
I told her, "my cum is good for your teeth"
I'm pokin', I'm strokin' all over your sheets
Left her tonsils soakin', didn't eat for a week
Put my dick in her mouth 'cause that bitch a liar
I'm dodgin' 12 on a 95
I told her, "lil mama, don't suck and drive"
Fall in love with a bitch, that's a homicide
Fell asleep in the pussy, that's suicide
Told her make me a sandwich then suck my dry
Semen same color as McDonald's fries
Pussy sweet as grandma's apple pie
My dick the same color as my leather seats
My bitch the same color as my fuckin' wrist
My wrist the same color as a sunny day
With yo' bitch and it's whatever Simon say
Fuck with me, you better start to dig yo' grave
In the studio like I'm at a parade
She said, "um I gotta go, [?]"
She [?] to cum on her face
Ski Mask just gave me the keys to the cut
He's Slump God, he got all these sluts tryna fuck
I'm a breadwinner, fuck Oscar Mayer's
Only selling drugs and I got more buyers
Finger painting in that pussy, soaking wet
When I hop on the beat, dream about me
She drowning in [?]
I go straight to her booty when she eats
Only thing I hate is when she fucking speaks

[Chorus: Sway Gold]
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
She on her knees, tryna charge me a fee
So I told that bitch, "please"
She could hop on this meat
100 degrees when I hop on the beat
I'm a p-i-m-p so she didn't charge me, ayy
Hoe fuck what you sayin'
You need to start prayin'
When this dick go in yo' mouth
I get to bustin', no discussions
If she suckin' this dick I ain't kissin' those lips
When she ain't gettin' dick, [?]
Like a Krabby Patty how I'm flippin' yo' bitch
Get yo' girl moanin', that's how I drop a diss, ayy
