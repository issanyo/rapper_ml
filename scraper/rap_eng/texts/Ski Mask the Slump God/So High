[Intro]
(A Lau on the beat)
If so, let me know
You're so high, high

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so high
Let me know, how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

[Chorus]
We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah, yah

[Interlude]
If so, let me know
If so, let me know
If so, let me know
If so-

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so high
Let me know, how high
We can go high, high
We can go high, high

[Chorus]
We can go high, high
We can soar, how high?
Let you know how high
If you hit my phone, yah, yah
But don't hit my phone, yah, yah
Bitch just leave me 'lone, yah, yah
I've been in the zone, yah, yah
For the ones that know, yah, yah, yah

[Outro]
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know
