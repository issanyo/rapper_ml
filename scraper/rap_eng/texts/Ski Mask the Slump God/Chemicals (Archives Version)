[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, Trill got a pistol, hey, hey
And I got a missile, huh, huh
Tyla got a who (water)
Get it with me, get it with me
Get it with me, get it with me

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, bay bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky, bitch

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
Walkin' on the water like I'm Jesus in this bitch
Diamonds on my wrist like I'm Frieza in this bitch
I just sniffed some cocaine made my jaw clench like a fist
Diamonds on my wrist, look like rainbows on a fish
Whoa now, I just switched my flow, how
This bitch tryna go, down, she just give me toe, now
You ain't got no boat, no, I just bought a yacht, yah
Rollin' down the thot, yah, I just sold a thot, yah yah yah

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, bay bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky, bitch

[Verse 2: CHXPO]
You’re astronomical
Bitch, I’m phenomenal
Try robbin me, that’s Mission impossible
She's colossal
Fuck on yo’ bitch, my dick on her tonsil
Just like a carnival, ridin’ around with an arsenal
Double my cup, quarter in my blunt
Got the glessy took 50, and my gun
Let this bitch, for a nigga tryna run
You're gonna get that 4
Running around with the scope off dope shooting at the stars
Put it in the grave yard
Niggas be actin hard, nigga tryna leave me out to starve
I went out on Hollywood blvd. so I sauce so hard

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
