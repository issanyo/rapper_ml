[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, oh my, oh my
Hah! Yah! Hah!
M-M-M-Murda
Huh, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Uhm, are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, ayy?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain
Like reptilian, cold heart that I'm carrying
Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
No, it's not up for debate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause I know there is no escape
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Like a dinner a lot on my plate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Ayy, ay-ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Can we race?
Lamb talk, she wanna marry like Kate, uh
It be hard for me to make a bitch date, uh
I've been focused, also growin', I don't like to wait, uh
Tall grass, yes I know around me be some snakes
Haul ass, always movin' so I like the pace
Soulja Boy, how I tell them that they out of date, uh
Instinct animal bitch, yes I hibernate
Chucky doll, told them bitches yes come out and play
Um so to say, Transformer I'm Bumblebee
Wish I really was Decepticon
But I don't got no evil in me
Can't comprehend what you say
That girl always on her knees
So like an episode of SpongeBob
That bitch be like ow my leg

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
No, it's not up for debate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause I know there is no escape
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Like a dinner, a lot on my plate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Ayy, ay-ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I've been waitin', heart vacant
Will you hold my hand in the rain?
Feel misconstrued and confused
Like a wild toucan in the zoo
Oh, sensei
How I've been kicking shit, feel like Bruce Lee
Youngest fucking flexer, no Lil Tay
I get bread like a full jar of mayonnaise
I say ayy, like okay take out on cake
Like an anime
One Punch in the pussy, like an anime
A1 Sauce no steak
Okay, hit it on the low, foot brake
Didn't even know her name
Chilling in the hills, LA

[Pre-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Uhm, are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, ayy?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain
Like reptilian, cold heart that I'm carrying
Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
No, it's not up for debate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause I know there is no escape
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Like a dinner, a lot on my plate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Ayy, ay-ayy, ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I've been up for days, I've been goin crazy
Only sex in bed, it's okay
This another wave, bought another chain
Bought another ring, I'm on fleek (I'm on fleek)
This ain't Lil' Zane, I got hits for days
Every time they play, they press repeat (Press repeat)
We tote sticks for real, not for Instagram
When the pressure on, we gon' eat (We gon' eat)
I gotta stick to the code
I can't switch it up too much, I'm a goat
These boys for real, I ain't sellin' my soul
I pop a Addy and hop in the Ghost and pour me a four
Scroll on the 'Gram, tryna catch me a ho
They listen up when I speak, I'm the pope
I'm the one still in the streets, give 'em hope
Never turn on 'em, my niggas an' them, nope

[Pre-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Uhm, are you feeling me?
Can you feel it, ayy?
I been lost for days, stuck in my brain
Like reptilian, cold heart that I'm carrying
Fell off with every man, tryna give me brain

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
No, it's not up for debate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
'Cause I know there is no escape
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Like a dinner, a lot on my plate
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm trapped in my mind on a date
Ayy, ay-ayy, ayy
