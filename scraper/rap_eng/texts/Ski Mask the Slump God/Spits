[Intro]
It's Dre
Esketit
Where to, huh? (water!)
Sip, Sip, Sip
Walk in, huh

[Chorus]
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, where (ay, ay, ay)
Where, where, where, where, ayee!
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
So I ask her-
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, ask the little bitch to come
Here, here, here, and wear my dick like who care, care, care
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
So I ask her-
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, ask the little bitch to come
Here, here, here, and wear my dick like who care, care, care

[Verse]
Your bitch must be on the fritz, bitch
Lie and say I'm not the shit, bitch
Hit your bitch once on my wishlist
And my weed smell like the shit
Straight from the diaper, straight from the bed
Goyard on bag, that's why you mad
I'm glad like the bag, look at these tags
That I be poppin' like zit, zit, zit, zit, zit, zit
It's how I pop off my gun, hun
Why your bitch smell like some Funyuns
You know that I had to run, huh
Like my name Forrest and Gump, huh
Get your bitch wet like a stump
Like camel her back I’m gon’ hump
Ray on my gun like the sun (ski, ski, ski, ski)
Like, where the fuck you going, uh-huh
Cancun, uh-huh, to the moon, uh-huh
Go ape, uh-huh, baboon, uh-huh
Hangin' out, uh-huh, cocoon and I'm slick like-
All on my legs, ksubis
Look at my denims, no crease
Neck chain like dog, and leash
And call me babywipe 'cause I'm so fresh and so clean, aye!

[Chorus]
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, where (ay, ay, ay)
Where, where, where, where, ayee!
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
So I ask her-
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, ask the little bitch to come
Here, here, here, and wear my dick like who care, care, care
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
She wanna give me the spits
She gonna give me the lips
So I ask her-
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where, ask the little bitch to come
Here, here, here, and wear my dick like who care, care, care
