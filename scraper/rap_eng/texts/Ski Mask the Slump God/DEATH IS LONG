[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Aye, Aye, Ayee
Bitch
Aye

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, aye

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I think that death is a present, bitch
It is the answer to everything
Waiting for Grim Reaper's banishment
Or for my prayers
Be heard or be answered quick, mmh
Balmains I'm dressed in them layers bitch
Hopefully cover the pain that's in mmh
Middle finger to my sins, I fuck up again
Then fuck up the check, I win

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, aye

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch on my dick like sideways, said it make her happy
Otherwise, that's Chipotle, mmh
Pinky and the Brain running wheel chrome tires
Now she want my wiener, Oscar Mayer, mmh
Know that I'm Apollo, know that you can't test me
Stunts on a jet ski, bet me, mmh
Only looking for the joy that life hides me
Otherwise thinking in my head like damn me

[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, mmh
Wait, mmh, rethink upon the mistakes, mmh
Death is long but worth the wait, mmh
Treat you like wishbone and break, mmh
Faith, aye
