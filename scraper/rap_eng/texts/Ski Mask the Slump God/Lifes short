Ayy, haha
Have you motherfuckin' seen my Goyard garments?
Bitch, VR Allstar, VR lifestyle, VR LF
(Them shits is motherfuckin' pretty fresh bro)
Look at my fuckin' garments
Lost Files
Ayy, lemme tell you somethin'
(What you fuckin' said?)

[Chorus]
Life's short, smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York, calculatin' like a dork (ayy, ayy)
Kill Bill tracksuit, 'preme shorts (ooh, kill)
Life's short, what it's worth, wrist work (ayy, ayy, yah)
Life's short, smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York, calculatin' like a dork (bitch)
Kill Bill tracksuit, 'preme shorts (ayy, kill)
Life's short, what it's worth, wrist work (ayy, bitch)

[Interlude]
Pew (pew, pew)
Pew (pew, pew)
Pew, pew
Uh, uh, uh (yah)

[Verse]
I can't pocket an L from my enemy (yah, ayy, yah)
You won't suck up or fuck up my energy (yah)
Chef Boyardee, bitch, I'm whippin' up sauce, ya see (ayy, whip)
Death to the bullshit, you talkin' that jealousy
Ice Cubes on a nigga neck like Is We There Yet? (Pew)
MAC turn your guts to macaroni wet, TEC, hit it (ayy)
Good pussy sound like macaroni, best wet
Never let another nigga try your set
Wanna be the best, don't hold your breath (ayy)
Lookin' at my garments and they striped like Ness
(Let's get it, okay, let's get it)

[Chorus]
Life's short, smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York, calculatin' like a dork (ayy, ayy)
Kill Bill tracksuit, 'preme shorts (ooh, kill)
Life's short, what it's worth, wrist work (ayy, ayy, yah)
Life's short, smoke a port on a port (on a port)
In New York, calculatin' like a dork (bitch)
Kill Bill tracksuit, 'preme shorts (ayy, kill)
Life's short, what it's worth, wrist work (ayy, bitch)
