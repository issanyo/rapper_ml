[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hey, ayy
Ski Bag The Bump God
You know y'all niggas woke up on a cloud of sauce
We ain't really worried 'bout nothing
Okay, drop my top, ooh

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm gon' make that pussy sound like mac 'n' cheese
I'm not sad baby, pockets fat as Mini-Me
Nigga think he can get away with disrespecting me
I'm like, fwoof, what's that stench, is that your jealousy?
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Okay like, you's a pussy boy,
Meatloaf meat how I eat your beef
Me and Milli On, Milly Rocking all up on yo' bitch
I'm not Martin Luther King, but I keep the piece
Your diamonds silly, look kinda frilly, my diamonds fat like Meech
This is not a dog laser, this a red beam
Robb Bank$ off a percocet, he might need itching cream
I still got blood on my burka, stop when I beat [?]
Your bitch wanna suck my dick, she know she cum for me

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm gon' make that pussy sound like mac 'n' cheese
I'm not sad baby, pockets fat as Mini-Me
Nigga think he can get away with disrespecting me
I'm like, fwoof, what's that stench, is that your jealousy?
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee

[Verse 2: Milli On]
I'ma make that pussy sound like whoopie cusion
Pussy chocolate pudding, eat it up like Mama cookin'
If she ever leave then she gonna come right back to me
I told her, "Don't turn your back on me
If you not throwin' it back on me"
Make sure all my niggas elevated
Say you real, demonstrate it
Did them niggas plenty favors
Back when I had pennies saved up
Now a nigga need to pay up
Now you can't really say nothin'
I could tell you jealous and you hatin'
Turned from a bum to the one
I got drugs all in my inventory
I just did like 10 with shorty
Hit it while the film recordin'
She gon' play with that pussy for me
Your bitch wanna cum for me
I call her up, she come to me
Only the money come for me
Hit it from the back, don't turn on me, girl

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm gon' make that pussy sound like mac 'n' cheese
I'm not sad baby, pockets fat as Mini-Me
Nigga think he can get away with disrespecting me
I'm like, fwoof, what's that stench, is that your jealousy?
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee
I can smell your jealousy, I can smell your jealousy
I can smell your hate from here, to be real it smell like pee
