[Intro]
Ahem
Uh, it’s the motor
Huh, huh
Push start then I float her!
Huh, okay, uh-huh
What’re you doing?
What would you like?
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Water!

[Verse 1]
I said, hi!
Good afternoon (good afternoon)
My name is Ski, and I'm higher than cow that jumped over the moon (jumped over moon)
Might be the coolest monkey in the jungle, but I'm not baboon (I'm not a baboon)
Like Nosferatu, vampire attire
What's on me, come with a tie and a suit (ooh wee)
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I want a Erykah Badu, uh-huh
Wet as a bayou (wet as a what?), uh-huh
Damn, that pussy knocked me out like it was a uppercut from Ryu, (Hadouken!) uh-huh
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Pussy nigga thought I lost my sauce, it's forever like a tattoo
I feel like the Packers logo, I'm a G (what)
These niggas be full of cap, like knees (what)
Fuck it, I’ma be the knees of bumblebees
Your mother is teaching me the birds and bees
John Cena arena, you can’t see me
I'ma bend that bitch like the letter C (C!)
Air Force 1 with the flow, no crease
Wish a nigga would, like he planting him a tree (water!)

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm off Hennessy, uh-huh
That shirt made from sheep, uh-huh
That bitch had me sleep, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
She gon' suck my meat, uh-huh
She suck me to sleep, uh-huh
She my freak-a-leak, uh-huh
That shirt made from sheep, uh-huh
That bitch had me sleep, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
She gon' suck my meat, uh-huh
She suck me to sleep, uh-huh
She my freak-a-leak, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh (I must've)

[Verse 2]
Yuh
Michael Myers, I'm trying to kill that pus-sy (wet)
Sesame Street, I'm a monster for that coo-kie (mmm, munch)
Lotta gang shit going on, but I'm not Boonk Gang (Boonk Gang!)
Soo-min gonna give me happy ending (water!)
I said finish an enemy, I will get rid of him
What is the minimum, maximum (maximum)
I used to trap and shit, now I be K.O
And he selling packs and be taxing 'em (taxing ‘em)
Stack up them, racks up them til they hit the top (stack)
Off with them vitamins, need good health to get the guap (bitch)
Sauce never dry, can't tell a lie, 'cause a nigga be the truth (true hey!)
Baby food, airplane spoon
How she open that mouth through the dick tube
I mean soon, I mean around noon, acting like a coon
Looney Tunes, when I'm with my goons
Higher than the moon

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
I'm off Hennessy, uh-huh
That shirt made from sheep, uh-huh
That bitch had me sleep, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
She gon' suck my meat, uh-huh
She suck me to sleep, uh-huh
She my freak-a-leak, uh-huh
That shirt made from sheep, uh-huh
That bitch had me sleep, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
She gon' suck my meat, uh-huh
She suck me to sleep, uh-huh
She my freak-a-leak, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
