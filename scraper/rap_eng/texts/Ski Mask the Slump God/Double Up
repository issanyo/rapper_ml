[Chorus: Kid Buu]
Run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Two diamond chain, double dutch
I just pulled up in a Bentley truck
I got the pint with a double cup
I got the plug we can double up
All the these blue hunnids I'm countin' up
Run it up, run it up

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Your bitch pussy, know I water gun it up
Suicidal bitch with suicidal thoughts
With three leaf clover, know that bitches luck is up
Yuh, yuh, my dick and her lips gon' touch
I heard your grandma, shit look at her butt
African diamonds they rough when I touch
Umm, yuh
Camel skin carpet I feel like Aladdin
Where your bitch been call her big like a Caddy
Swipin' I'm swipin' bitch send me that addy
Pack on a nigga, and no, this not a fanny
I am the type to sell your grandma xanny
She think I'm Nelly, but with no band-aid
Got that lil nigga pissy, R. Kelly
I have the AK, but I'm not Tay-K
Told 'em put hands up but don't hit the nae nae

[Chorus: Kid Buu]
Run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Two diamond chain, double dutch
I just pulled up in a Bentley truck
I got the pint with a double cup
I got the plug we can double up
All the these blue hunnids I'm countin' up
Run it up, run it up

[Verse 2: Kid Buu]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, run it up, run it up, run it up
My little baby she got her the bubble butt
I might pull up in a Tonka Truck
We cannot talk on the cellular
I smoke the gas, that's everyday regular
I sip the Wock, you sippin' on Benadryl
I put my bitch in expensive heels
Diamonds, they shine like a chandelier
Roll up a Backwood and put me four grams in it
All this Gucci on my body
I cannot fuck with lil shawty
'Cause we all know she a thottie
Fuckin' shit up in a 'Rari
My weapons, they callin' me gnarly
My bitch, she look like a Barbie
But no, that booty not plastic
Don't mind the milli, it's plastic
Back how I shoot it, it's plastic (bubble butt)
If you run up, you get blasted (bubble butt)
Ski called the shooter, it's tragic (bubble butt)
I'm Humungous The God, bitch, who's asking? Ooh!

[Chorus: Kid Buu]
Run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Two diamond chain, double dutch
I just pulled up in a Bentley truck
I got the pint with a double cup
I got the plug we can double up
All the these blue hunnids I'm countin' up
Run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up
Two diamond chain, double dutch
I just pulled up in a Bentley truck
I got the pint with a double cup
I got the plug we can double up
All the these blue hunnids I'm countin' up
Run it up, run it up
