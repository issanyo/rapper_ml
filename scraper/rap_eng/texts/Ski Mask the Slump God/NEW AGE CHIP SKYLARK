[Intro]
Hey! Hey! Hey!
My shiny teeth and, me!
Bitch!
Chain swang!
Chip Skylark like I got on like three chains

[Chorus]
White gold,(wet, flex)
Shine ho,(wet, flex)
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho,(aye, yuh) ayyy
Kid Buu, kung fu shoes on me
Raf like Riff with the Simmons
No Diggy
Blue-Eyes White Dragon how my weed be
Like I'm Paul Wall since white gold my teeth
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho,(aye, yuh)
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho, ayyy
Kid Buu, kung fu shoes on me
Raf like Riff with the Simmons
No Diggy
Blue-Eyes White Dragon how my weed be
Like I'm Paul Wall since white gold my teeth

[Verse]
Keep that condom on me
Handy dandy like a notebook
Netflix 'The Notebook'
Don't get your hoe took
King Dede up in them guts, I hit 'em with a Bingkingking
Pepperminted candy color sauce that I have spilt on yee
Oops! with the mop, don't slip
Mitsubishi but I dropped in like a blimp
Ally up with the patch on Kim
Exam your hood and the clit
Sucked on my balls
She a lint licker
Fuck wit' me
I'm a clit flicker
[Catching pussy like a chevy on some 20â€™s on some gats]
Gucci printed glasses on my face like Clark Kent
[Pull up on go like coke for the rent
Count Dracula six gold on him (on him)
Ring in the croud
My weed, my wow
Fuckbout the Benjamins, Bow Wow
Take his chest off, like-]

[Chorus]
White gold,(wet, flex)
Shine ho,(wet, flex)
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho,(aye, yuh)
Kid Buu, kung fu shoes on me
Raf like Riff with the Simmons
No Diggy
Blue-Eyes White Dragon how my weed be
Like I'm Paul Wall since white gold my teeth
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho,(aye, yuh)
White gold,(aye, yuh)
Shine ho
Kid Buu, kung fu shoes on me
Raf like Riff with the Simmons
No Diggy
Blue-Eyes White Dragon how my weed be
Like I'm Paul Wall since white gold my teeth
