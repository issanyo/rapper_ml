[Intro: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat, ayy
Ayy, yuh

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy

Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face

[Verse 1: Reggie Mills]
YSL Socks with the bape
Ski mask, no face no case
Straight to the top I don't wait
Getting the top in the Wraith
She give the sloppiest face
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Touching the cheddar like I a food inspecter
Ain't nothing that's better I tripple my bread up
I fuck on your bitch I make that pussy wetter
My diamonds they shine like a glacier
Off-white with the Vlone
They told me stop but I keep going
Gas, wax, smoke in the vape
You get her I got her, I gave her
Dick in her throat, I put dick in your hoe
Niggas be acting like hoes with hoes for the hoes

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Tell the truth!
Who, me? Well the truth hurts
And my scars is the motherfucking proof
Irk, skrrt
Sound of the craftmatic seat
When I lean in the panoramic coupe
Uh, burp
Niggas feel a little bit gassy
Stomach on knot knot
Sippin' on Wock Wock
Rollie on a nigga don't tick-tock
I smell Fugazi coming from your wristwatch, ayeee
Niggas mad, bitch I'm glad like a bag, thirty-thousand
Don't forget I'm on your ass like some grass
Make his face kiss my knuckles like some brass
Vroom-vroom, what I'm smoking nitrous gas
Lil bitch!

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
I do not fuck with these niggas
Clip to his lip if he fuck with my figures
I feel like Trey Song 'cause I keep me a trigger
Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face

[Bridge: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat
Straight in your face

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy

Nigga mad 'cause his bitch want a picture
Don't be mad nigga get up your way
Goyard on a young nigga's waist
Twenty-thousand put it straight in your face
I do not fuck with these niggas, ayy
