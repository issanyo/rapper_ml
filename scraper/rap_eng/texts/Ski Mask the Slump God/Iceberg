[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch I think i’m lit, as my [?] candle
“Why?” Um, 'cuz I got a bitch from Disney Channel
Pistol with the pill, sideways hold the handle
Oh no I got hot this year, as much as Earth mantle
Ummm, just like Frebreze
When that bitch spray
That bitch it might make ya sneeze
Aim for the knees, no bitch I aim for the teeth
Never say please, she still gave me that pussy
I’m like, ouch, fuck on uncomfortable couch
I’m like, ou ou, hit that nigga in the mouth
That is the best approach, to treat a human roach
I had to tell my coach, his life cost less than my coat
So, yo bitch don’t question the win
That means she second again
That means she—brought her a friend
And her friend brought her a friend
All of them bitches is tens
Watch on my wrist like Ben 10
I wanna fuck all your friends
[?]

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Excuse me, sir?
Who is the maker?
Is that an iceberg?
Is that a glacier?
Excuse me, sir?
Is that an iceberg?
Is that a glacier?
Who is the maker?
Yes bitch, got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (got new ice)
Who’s the maker?
Got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (is it nice?)
Got new ice (got new ice)
It’s a glacier?

[Verse: Kofi Harris]
Stepped up out my house
And I’m playin’ with that [?]
Everybody hate me 'cuz my ice look like glaciers
Blue and yellow diamonds, same color as the Pacers
Yeah I even threw a couple diamonds in my mink fur
I’m Kofi, I’m low-key
You know me, I’m a G
I smoke weed, my wrist freeze
I got molly, coke and weed
Gimme that cheese, gimme the keys
Gimme that iceage watch me freeze
Gimme that girl, just watch her leave
Gimme that ice, I like to streech
Gimme that beat from FH3
I’m gon’ be that hit [?]
This a movie, not a scene
Kofi Harris, had a dream
Gettin’ this money, off that green
Pushin' white [?]
Came to this game I had no team
Ice so bright I’m out of seam
[?]
Pockets so heavy, like ass in them jeans
Shoulders so brazy, you know that I’m clean
[?] hoes, get all in between
Millions given, I gave 'em for free
Stepped in yo block and I lit up the scene
I shop for the kids that would do it for me
Stop watch on my watch and my time ain’t free

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Excuse me, sir?
Who is the maker?
Is that an iceberg?
Is that a glacier?
Excuse me, sir?
Is that an iceberg?
Is that a glacier?
Who is the maker?
Yes bitch, got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (got new ice)
Who’s the maker?
Got new ice (got new ice)
Got new ice (is it nice?)
Got new ice (got new ice)
It’s a glacier?

[Verse: Kofi Harris]
Oh I think she likes me
I pulled up on yo’ wifey
Why he wanna fight me?
Cuz’ I’m so icy
Icy, icy, icy
Yeah I know she likes me
Lights, camera, action
Diamonds shining off my white teeth
Got diamonds in my Nike’s
[?]
Gettin’ that bag, man, straight up off that white tee
Yeah I took his psyche
Ski took his wifey
Fred got his ice piece, he’s honcho of the [?]
Now you don’t like me
Yo girl is a [?]
And you call her wifey
We just call her Slide B

Made a lotta cabbage sell a whole lotta broccoli
Late night trappin’, damn
Man, I lost my wifey
Goofy ass nigga ova’ there wanna fight me

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
