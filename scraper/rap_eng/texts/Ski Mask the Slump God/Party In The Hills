Intro (Ski Mask The Slump God)
Bad with my aim when I cum
Your bitch want meat, my filet-mignon
I hide the kids deep in her throat
Lettin' it go on her body, no bum
Smokin' on Afghan, matter fact, Saddam
No ceilings like Weezy, but she feeling linen
'Cause I turn the chicken up into a picket
But fuck all that drama, you can meet my llama

Grio$: Party in the hills we bout to have a thrill
Everybody rolling on that yea we poppin pills
Party in the hills we bout to have a thrill
I told that little bitch we’re through cause we bout to chill
Party in the hills we bout to have a thrill
Everybody rolling on that yea we poppin pills
Party in the hills we bout to have a thrill
I told that little bitch we’re through cause we bout to chill

Party looking lit call it Project X
Everybody drunk as shit all these girls want sex
(hey) Pop another little pill
Smoking on the kill kill
Call me faded i dont wanna turn, hell
Yea this bitch got me she dated
I can go from plenty reals
And lit, lit lit like lit
I'm not finishing this lmao
