[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & RyBundy]
Uh (ooh), yuh
This that new shit
Hi, my name is Ryan
I'm in your hood and my face card good
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up
Ride up a [?] like [?] this boof
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up
Ride on yo' grandma like a Yoshi

[Chorus]
One, nothing's wrong with me
Two, something's wrong with me
Three, sevens up upon my face
Antbully can't break my colony
One, nothing's wrong with me
Two, something's wrong with me
Three, sevens up on my face
Antbully can't break my colony

[Verse]
I got blood on my boot
Stomp the yard, and his tooth
Canc√∫n, water bezels
Black and white like a raccoon
Full moon
Tryna feed XXX, another coon
Bitch I'm in the booth with the black pepper makin' beats
Know that's how I'm breakin' this statue
Flesh wound the pussy Sharkboy bite
Got 'em anyway, gon' eat after I fight
So call em KK and I'm Ray J how you get fucked
'Cause you know I brought the strap out like a dyke might
With a thottie on his deathbed how he call to Christ
Line him up like on a sunny day bitch fly a kite
April first I'm not gon' fuck his bitch then say sike
Let her body hit the blow like I'm frost bite
Metal on me like I'm Bender, mm
Sauce on me spilled like a blender, mm
You niggas sweet just like Splenda, mm
Box yo ass up like some Tinder, ayy
Dick on me that's what I lend her
After that whose to say that's the text that I sent her
Cheated on you like an answer
You captain underpants cause you defender, mm
Already said it
Know that she ready
Like I'm That's So Raven at a getty
Fetty Wap fetti
Money, confetti
[?] tom not the brady
I'm never lazy
Eyesight be hazy
Still I run the set like Tom Brady
No one had made me
They gotta pay me
My jewelry sick like the patient (okay)

[Chorus]
One, nothing's wrong with me
Two, something's wrong with me
Three, sevens up upon my face
Antbully can't break my colony
One, nothing's wrong with me
Two, something's wrong with me
Three, sevens up upon my face
Antbully can't break my colony

[Outro]
Blow! Bitch, flow, flow, flow
That's right, bitch
Let the bodies hit the, blow
My back! Lil' bitch
