[Hook]
Just jumped off the porch
Now I need a Porsche
Just jumped off the porch
Now I need a Porsche
I like fast cars, bitch
I like Nascar
What's that on my hat?
Ferrari bitch on horse
Just jumped off the porch
Now I need a Porsche
Just jumped off the porch
Now I need a Porsche
I like fast cars, bitch
I like Nascar
What's that on my hat?
Ferrari bitch on horse

[Verse]
Diamonds threw a hurdle
Flat like portal, wet like Squirtle
Coke bottle bitch no girdle
While you're busy fucking with them rats, Ninja Turtles
$ki made a stunt on a jet ski
After that I'll mountain bike ya bitch like a 10 speed
My bitch heat like lava girllet me drift the boat in the seas like she mrs pearl
Keep the strap just like nympho, uh
Bean on my head like a Pinto, uh
Never break out like a wrinkle, uh
I think my wrist have to tinkle, uh
Okay, "you're vool" is my lingo, uh
Bricks super wet like a bimbo yeah
Serpent has entered me
Wet what he said to me
Now diamonds dance like a mingo yeah
