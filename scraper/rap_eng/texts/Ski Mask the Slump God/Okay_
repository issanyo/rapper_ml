Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse]
Say, I got too much skills
I flow out the water, so surprised I did not grow gills
And I am your father, like you was on Skywalker
And I don't turn and let it burn, like Usher's perm
And kill confirmed
You look concerned, respect this earn, uh
You really be enemy, gotta be kiddin' me, uh
You really be sick and that, I got the remedy, uh
I'm feelin' like Goku, bitch, I dig your energy, uh

[Chorus]
Um, okay
Goin' on a date with a AK, ayy
Okay
Goin' on a date with a AK, ayy
...
