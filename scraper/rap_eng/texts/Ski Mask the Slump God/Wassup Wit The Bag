[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?

[Verse 1: Lar$$en]
Might fuck around and pull up, uh
Pull up in the coupe (skrr-skrr)
All black with the boot (yuh-yuh)
She wanna fuck? Yeah, me too (brr-brr)
Diamonds so cold like achoo (brr)
Run up on me I'ma shoot, (huh) you
Smokin' that gas, going crazy
I'm going crazy, yeah I'm in the booth (yah-yah)
If you a snake, please do not say nothing to me
That bitch she act like she knew me?
My money stand tall, your shit like just Stewie
And generic, that's that shit that I like
Nah, don't stop at the lights
Pussy boy you a bitch, you just do it for likes

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?
Put gucci on tag, put gucci on tag, put gucci on tag

(Look at it, look at it, look at it)
What's up with the bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag
What's up with the bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag
Put gucci on tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag
I know why they mad, I know why they mad
I know why they mad, mad, mad, mad

[Verse 2: Jay Critch]
I'm doing the dash, get straight to the cash
I pick up the phone where the fuck is the bag
She calling my jack, I'm not with the traffic
Bitch I'm tryna smash, what's up with that ass?
She say I'm the worst, diamonds they splash
She want a purse, throw her in the trash
My pockets might burst, full of the cash
Baller alert, I'm popping the tag
Check out my shirt, cost me a tag
Ya niggas dirt, you doing bad
I'm coming in first , y'all come in last
I'm done with the verse, send that shit back
Ice on me like the skate team
Now that bitch hate me
She see my diamonds in HD
I get the chicken with gravy
In the Mercedes, diamonds they biting like rabies

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yup, yup, mm
I know that pussy got scabies
I just stand out, uh
Suck on my dick, bite like rabies
Know that a nigga's sauce wetter than barnacle
I just ate Mr. Krabs with some damn tartar sauce
I am not human, bitch I am a robot
Just like my name was Bionicle

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?
Wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag, wassup with the bag?
Put gucci on tag, put gucci on tag, put gucci on tag
I know why they mad, I know why they mad
I know why they mad!
(Look at it, look at it, look at it)
What's up with the bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag
What's up with the bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag, bag
Put gucci on tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag, tag
I know why they mad, I know why they mad
I know why they mad, mad, mad, mad

[Outro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Producer JAMZ]
Bitch!
