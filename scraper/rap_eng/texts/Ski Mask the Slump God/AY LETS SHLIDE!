[Intro]
Yuh, yuh
Ay, yuh
Ew, ew, ew
Bitch (lil' bitch)
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Shine, shine, shine

[Verse]
Ay
I might fuck on the cougar, ay
Demon, they dress like Akuma, ay
Your dick is just for her humor, ay
Now rub on my belly like Buddha
Very Rare, I might vool her, ay
Just got my ring out the cooler, ay
Don't know the name of my jeweler, ay
Tokyo Drift like I'm Luda, okay
She wanna fuck my fam
I'm tryna bring the cam, ay
She like, "Who you is?" ay
I'm like, "Who I am?" ay
Baby girl, my name $ki (Ski)
I might skeet on ye (you)
Only gotta do me one favor (uh-huh)
Just know this dick ain't free, okay
Dropped the bezel
Had to switch my schedule on my bitch
She like a Lego, never let go
Hoe might stuck up on me, so I call her velcro
Tell her need my dinero pendejo
Hit my metro if it’s not the pencil
Like its "Go Diego!" make it right on schedule
Got a pistol on me with a big extendo
Bitches in the back just like a fucking echo, ay
That bitch told me you got pencil dick
She grip on my dick like a selfie stick
I got a big gun, I need help with it
To wet yo babe up, Michael Phelps with it
I knew some fuck niggas, I dealt with it
How I'm rapping I need me a gun with it
And that bitch you should stop all that frontin’ shit
Like this game ain't no ball and I'm puntin’ shit

[Hook (x2)]
Ay let's slide, ay let's slide
Ay let's slide, ay let's slide
30 on the .9, ay let's slide
Your bitch on my mind, ay let's slide

[Outro]
Go!
