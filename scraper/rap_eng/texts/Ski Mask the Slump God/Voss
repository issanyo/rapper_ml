She said, "Well it's the mall." I was like, "Whatever, bitch, get me a chicken sandwich and some waffle fries"

[Intro: Buné]
Buné

Fuck Aquafina, be drinkin' the Voss

Pipin' her down, I’ma spray with my sauce
Fuck all the weed, she be snortin' a brick
Bust in her mouth while she suckin' my stick
Lovin' the slobber, I’m lovin' the lick
Sappin' a JUUL while she sappin' my dick
Wearin' a Rollie but whippin' a Wraith
Fuckin' yo' bitch, I'ma bust on her face
Knockin' her out, I'ma spray her with mace
Leavin' real quick, disappear with no trace
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Whippin' the Wraith, whippin' the Wraith

[Interlude: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Just like at Pizza Hut, I serve yo' order
And might I just mention, I just met yo' mother
Her nose is humongous, Mr. Krabs' daughter
She got a big head like on the fuckin' quarter
Top rope, ayy
Swingin' in the pussy, Rey Mysterio, uh
619 to her pussy hole (pussy hole)
Bite-bite-bite
Hit it too hard, she might cry-cry, okay
Eat on that pussy like bath salts
'Til I make a million, not takin' my durag off, mm
Chain on me wet like I put Axe on
Niggas be some pussy just like in the show CatDog, mm
Fuck on your mother with slacks on
When she be doin' that back talk, uh
Big Mac, I just spilled some sauce though, uh
Shout out my parents and Rick Ross, ho, ayy

[Chorus: Buné]
Drinking the water, it's Voss (yuh)
Come on yo' bitch, call it sauce (ayy)
Drinking the water, it's Voss (yuh)
Come on yo' bitch, call it sauce (ayy)
Drinking the water, it's Voss (yuh)
Come on yo' bitch, call it sauce (yuh)
Bitch, I'm the man, I'm the boss (yuh)
Sprayin' your girl with my sauce (ayy)
