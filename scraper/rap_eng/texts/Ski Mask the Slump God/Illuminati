[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh! yuh! (woke up on a cloud of sauce)
Diablo
Ayee, shoutout my mucus!
Yuh! yuh! yuh!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, yo bitch on my bo-oh (ay-ay, ayeee!)

[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God & Lil Yachty]
I might pull up with a pocket and rocket
I pull out and cock it and pop it, huh (I might pull up with a pocket)
Reach in the back of my pocket
Four racks and I slapped on the top of her noggin'
Yeah, slap on a bitch, huh
Pull out that MAC on a bitch, huh
I might just mack on your bitch, huh
.223 staff for the bitch, huh
Yeah, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em
AR extendos, AK, yeah I tote 'em
I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em, I tote 'em
My clip long as totem, your bitch lick my scrotum
Man, Lil Yachty and JBan$, they be my vrodem
Your bitch suck my toe just to know them
They pull up with a new medal like top of the soda
You still got the green on like Yoda (water!)
Stains on my cup, mhmm, lean residue
Making new revenue, I'm hotter than a kettle boot
Um, phew, I be flyer than a cardinal
In a brand new cardigan, looking like a damn father do, uh
Diamond my ear, wet as a tear, I-I got no fear
Off-White label on the arm of my gear
And your eyes fear like headlights on a deer

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet-wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet-wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, yo bitch on my bo-oh (ay-ay, ayeee!)
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet-wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati (wet-wet)
I got some money, no Illuminati (I got some money, no)
No chains on my body, your bitch on my body
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, 'Nati)
I got some money, no Illuminati (bitch, aye)
I got some money, no Illuminati (yuh, yuh, aye, aye)
No chains on my body, yo bitch on my bo-oh (ay-ay, ayeee!)
