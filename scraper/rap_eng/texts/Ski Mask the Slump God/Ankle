[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Warhol.ss]
A Lau on this beat, I'm replenished, part 2
My dick make yo' bitch
Uh, huh-huh-huh
Huh-huh, 'cause she, like-like an ankle
From an angle, did you say an-
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Said my pockets all stuffed, look like ankle (look like what?)
Said my pockets on pump, look like ankle (look like what?)
Like an ankle (like a what?)
From an angle (from a what?)
Yuh, I might bend yo' bitch just like Kurt Angle
Said my pockets all stuffed, look like ankle (from an angle)
Said my pockets on pump, look like ankle (like an ankle)
From an angle (from an angle)
To see an angle (between your-)
I might bend yo' bitch just like an ankle

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
'Cause the gorilla skin fur coat that be on me
So you ask yourself "oh really can Harambe?"
I just like it when my pussy warm like Snuggie
She said, "oof, what's that smell that's around me?"
It's me, I'm the shit, need Huggies
What are those on your feet? They Y-3
I'm like hah, hah, hah while your napping
'Cause your bitch excite me like Bruges' Fries, B

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
Okay, my pockets on pot like a landmine
And the money steady callin' like a landline
I got one Xan and two bitches we call it halftime
I ride the Chevy, we poppin', now pop the outpine
Offset with the flex got these niggas upset
Got ten bitches, one jit from that hoe on the stretcher
I be breaking bitches backs like I put 'em on a stretcher
Undercover with a red 9 on my dress
Ric Flair, Nature Boy, I be runnin' with the realest
I be ballin' with the bitches they call me Young Skrillex
Got the visionary, these lil' niggas they can't get a view
I be around me, lonely
I can't fuck with niggas, they so fool

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God & Warhol.ss]
Bitch, bitch
Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah
Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah
HUH, HUH, HUH, HUH, HUH
Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, ayee!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Said my pockets all stuffed, look like ankle (look like what?)
Said my pockets on pump, look like ankle (look like what?)
Like an ankle (like a what?)
From an angle (from a what?)
Yuh, I might bend yo' bitch just like Kurt Angle
Said my pockets all stuffed, look like ankle (from an angle)
Said my pockets on pump, look like ankle (like an ankle)
From an angle (from an angle)
To see an angle (between your-)
I might bend yo' bitch just like an ankle
