[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Uh, um, yuh
Sick in the stu (what?)
(like what?) don't smell, haha, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah (water)

[Verse 1: Ski Mask the Slump God]
My bitch Costa Rican but (Rican), we in Puerto Rico, oh (Rico)
She be wet, hold my breath (hold it)
Dive in holdin' secrets, oh (splash)
Way that I do it I make it look frequent
I'm hittin' your bitch for the weekend, um
You know a young nigga slime in these sheets
And so evil I could be a deacon, um (slime slime slime)
Took one look up upon my neck
And she said bitch it's freezin', um (freeze)
I heard she a vegan, but she gon' eat my meat with no seasons
'Cause I'm sleek, and I think swift on my feet
Just like a broom and a sweep
And I'm sharp, just like the foot of a cleat
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean, bitch

[Chorus: Ronny J]
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now

[Verse 2: Ronny J]
Horse for the wet, she gon' suck the drip
Too easy to hit, I don't need a bitch
Donuts in the whip, NYC then LAX
Fifty on my wrist, flexin' on the internet
Know your place in the race
Give me face, I want face
I got a bag, you see the Jag
Only blue hundreds I keep in the stash
I hit up your bitch, she throwin' that ass
Brick on my wrist when I count up the cash
Philippe Patek, I'm movin' fast
Diamonds wet up and they makin' you mad

[Chorus: Ronny J]
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
Checks gon' keep me up, pussy bring me down
I got money now, my wrist leakin' now
