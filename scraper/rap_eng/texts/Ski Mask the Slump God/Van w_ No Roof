[Hook: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Take ya stress off with the tool
Scope on the pole make 'em snooze
Slide in the van wit' no roof
My boof just like real estate, stay like a roof
Take ya stress off with the tool
Scope on the pole make 'em snooze
Slide in the van wit' no roof
My boof just like real estate, stay like a roof
