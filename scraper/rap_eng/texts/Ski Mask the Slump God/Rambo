[Intro]
Ayy! Woah, yuh, yuh, slide
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Water! Get it, get it, get it, get it
Okay, huh, bitch
Okay, like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
This Rambo, this Rambo, this Rambo
No Rambo, no Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
No Rambo, no Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
These niggas they pussies, they tango
I swear I'm an MC no hammer
No ammo, like Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
These niggas they pussies, they tango
I swear I'm an MC no hammer, okay

[Verse]
If you ever take a shot at me, check my peacock
Peacoat as if the same fuckin' color as rabies, weasel
Okay you vool, but don't comprehend my lingo
Like I'm Mandingo, when in the pussy I tango
Matter of fact, whip that pussy like D-D-D-Django
Then tell her give me head like the hat made from Kangol
I had to cop me one of them fucking colored pencils
No ammo but I'm still killing beats like Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo
These niggas flip-flop like a sandal
Only live for a scent like a candle
I'ma light they ass up like earth's mantle
No Hannah Montana
But bitch I look pretty on the camera
Bathin' Ape on, I don't eat bananas
Rep the gang, no back pocket bandanna
Kiddin' me, thinkin' that you are not a Piccadilly
Racks in my pocket look like some pads without the lilly
Smoking presidential like the name of it is Hillary
That broad she say she feel my energy, ooh
Whip my dick out, then she kung-fu grip that
Know how I'm rockin' like Slipknot
Kryptonite in my wrist watch

[Chorus]
No Rambo, no Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
These niggas they pussies, they tango
I swear I'm an MC no hammer
No ammo, like Rambo
Like Rambo, like Rambo, like Rambo
These niggas they pussies, they tango
I swear I'm an MC no hammer, okay
