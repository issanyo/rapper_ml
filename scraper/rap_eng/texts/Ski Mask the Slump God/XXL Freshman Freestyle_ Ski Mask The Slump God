You and yo'—, you and yo'—
You and yo' bitch kinda resemble Billy and Mandy
My bitch like Sandy
'Cause of the cheeks
Rode on my dick and said "It was so dandy"
Yippee ki-yay
I heard Freddie don't fuck with the feds
Yellow bitches on me like Lemonhead
Run up my sack like Ed and Edd and Eddy
Red and black sweater like my name is Freddy
Color spaghetti
Eyes so messy, pea-coat khaki
Never lackin', keep that .30 in my jacket
Look at the diamonds, they on hush mode
'Cause I bought diamonds for they ex hoe
It be so clear and so see through
Like a nigga lookin' through the peephole, uh
I just send them "XD rawr"
When I be texting your whore
Look at candy paint on car
It's brown like the Noah's Ark
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean
And put a nigga on game like Atari
Know how a nigga rockin' like guitar
What I'm smoking smellin' like a fart
Like Hercules, strong on these bitches, they back on knees
Back in that bitch like, "What's happening?"
Jump in that pussy like trampoline
Made that pussy sound like mac and cheese
When I hit it I'm just practicing
They be like, "Ski, you be snappening"
Teach me the ways of the saucin' king, hah?
