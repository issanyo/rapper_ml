[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, Trill got a pistol, hey, hey
And I got a pistol, huh, huh
Tyla got a who (water)
Get it with me, get it with me
Get it with me, get it with me

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, bay bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky, bitch

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
Walkin' on the water like I'm Jesus in this bitch
Diamonds on my wrist like I'm Frieza in this bitch
I just sniffed some cocaine made my jaw clench like a fist
Diamonds on my wrist, look like rainbows on a fish
Whoa now, I just switched my flow, how
This bitch tryna go, down, she just give me toe, now
You ain't got no boat, no, I just bought a yacht, yah
Rollin' down the thot, yah, I just sold a thot, yah yah yah

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy bay
Ayy ayy bay, ayy bay, bay bay
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky, bitch

[Verse 2: HP The SupaFreak]
Watch out, watch out, watch out
Bitch I rock out with my cock out
Young fly nigga bring the back out
Big titty bitch blow my top off
You know that we ball, you know we get down
Hurricane Chris, swag on the sky
[?], or what?
I am a king, like my name is John
She just wanna fuck, I just want the bucks
I make it look easy, you make it look rough
You know it is tough, I'm callin' your bluff
Ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy bay, ayy bay
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite, yah

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
I am a chemist, like I'm Bill Nye
Measure the lean, pour in the sprite
Double the cup, like Futurama
I am so fried, just like some fries
Ayy bay, ayy ayy bay, ayy ayy bay
