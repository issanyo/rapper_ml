[Intro: Robb Bank$]
Gettin' too overzealous
Cris Dinero
Straight pulled out my dick, let her smell it
I think I might be happy
Let's get it, woo woo woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you dig?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you dig?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you dig?
You dig? SSET, ayy

[Verse 1: Robb Bank$]
I done have way too many niggas back down off a stare
Fell off so quick, God forgot you was there
Bitch I look like Griffith, I ain't dye my hair
You can't beat me boy, I was born from despair, real nigga shit
Hop out the A, straight in your bitch, huh huh
I need a check, I'm teacher pet, huh huh
She wanna fuck, I wanna lick, make her scream phone
Make it rain, make it storm, coulda look at me like God
New bitch bad as fuck, little nigga back it up
Phone add it up, new coupe I pass you up
I could get your s-w-a-g-agger up
Nigga these ain't Swarovski crystals
Grab my pistol, my flavor ain't artificial
Said I only rap 'bout bitches, nigga I get it
I let ya count them wit' me

[Chorus: Robb Bank$, Ski Mask The Slump God]
One bad bitch on my dick, two bitches on my dick
Three bitches on my dick, four bitches on my dick
Count wit' me nigga
Five bitches on my dick, six bitches on my dick
Seven bitches want that dick, show yo' ass how to make a hit
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
Look out (ayy ayy ayy), look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch (ayy)
One bad bitch on my dick (who, yuh), two bitches on my dick
(Ayy ayy)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I like crazy bitches, she like baby pictures
I'm a lazy rich nigga so I lazy dick her
Stroke on lazy river, metal on me, call me Bender
Bitch I'm at yo' head
Like the arrow on the Avatar Airbender
Dance up on my bitch
'Cause I hit it from the back just like a fender bender
I done hit a triple, no assist
Damn that bitch rode me like a airbender
I be so lit like a candle, grip on her hips like a handle
My sauce just like I am Randall, man
So much damn white on me I'm like "damn Daniel"
When I bust a pistol bitch it sound like a flip-flop
Tick-tock, three blind mice, I walk my stick and pull out
Pull out gang, whack-a-mole, duckin' at us
I done teabag your bitch
She said my balls red like dodgeball

[Chorus: Robb Bank$]
One bad bitch on my dick, two bitches on my dick
Three bitches on my dick, four bitches on my dick
Count wit' me nigga
Five bitches on my dick, six bitches on my dick
Seven bitches want that dick, show yo' ass how to make a hit
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
Look out, look out, I'ma hit a four-peat bitch
