[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Light

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
You and yo' bitch kinda resemble Billy and Mandy
My bitch like Sandy
'Cause of the cheeks
Rode on my dick and said "It was so dandy", uh
Red and black sweater like my name is Freddy
Color spaghetti
Eyes so messy, pea-coat khaki
Never lackin', keep that .30 in my jacket, uh
Look at the diamonds, they on hush mode, uh
'Cause I bought diamonds for they ex hoe, uh
It be so clear and so see through, uh
Like a nigga lookin' through the peephole, uh
I just send them "XD rawr"
When I be texting your whore
Look at candy paint on car
It's brown like the Noah's Ark
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean
And put a nigga on game like Atari
Know how a nigga rockin' like guitar
Put a nigga on game like a tart
