[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God and DIRTYFACESMOOK]
You niggas worried, lookin pussy, like the courage
Wit' that thirty, leave a pussy dirty, like I'm Curry
Street sweepin', got a broomstick on my thirty
Little bitch flirty, pussy purrin', like it's Gary
You niggas worried, lookin pussy, like the courage
Wit' that thirty, leave a pussy dirty, like I'm Curry
Street sweepin', got a broomstick on my thirty
His bitch flirty, pussy purrin', like it's Gary

[Verse: Ski Mask the Slump God and DIRTYFACESMOOK/Both]
Balmains with the wrinkles like a pug
And I must be virgin cause I never gave a fuck
Say I'm extension cord I got the best plug
I'm feelin' like a father who her nigga gave mean mug
I'm outer space I touched the moon bitch I done glo'd up
I got the K don't be a fool you'll get sewed up
Got Vintage Cartiers I'm seein' thru the bullshit
This movie rated X directors cut a full clip
Hopscotch jump that nigga like a skip
Pop Pop, how she twerk them pussylips
Can you dig it, we got clips like a snippet
To make some noise, need some help, like a cricket
The roof feel like Jurrasic Park I'm gettin money now
Ski Mask keep a 30 'round, gun 'em down
I got a very rare chopper in my skinny jeans
Don't make me pop it bitch I'll cock it back and wet the scene
Ay, watch me pull up to the scene in the car from the movie Cars Lightning Mcqueen
Red on my raf like a beam
Kick to your mouth now you out like some lean
I be on some big mon ting
"I love gold!" said my pinkyring
Step through red bottom clean like a nigga musta crawled up, out, in a â€˜merzine
Smook, zoot, alley-oop the boot, in the booth
Abercrombie your bitch, a moose
Duck Duck Goose, in the cooch
You know I pits up a layer on my bitch in her hair
Can you say very rare?
And my wrist look so inviting just like it's a flare
Wiz weed, purple hair
Whip that bitch, grip that bitch
Gettin' outa line, huh, pimpslap bitch
Whip that bitch, grip that bitch
Keep them baby's 'round me like a Cabbage Patch kid
Ok whip that bitch, whip that bitch
Oh
Thats the end?
