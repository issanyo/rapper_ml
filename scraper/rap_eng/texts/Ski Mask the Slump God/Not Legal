[Intro]
Drippy drip, drippy drip, drippy drip
Ayy, ya dig (Bitch)
Ayy, ma nigga kill shit in the cut (Bitch)
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1: KiD TRUNKS]
The only reason I let you live because you sorry alive
And if I see you in my city, make sure you come check in twice
I can't remember why these people always believe the lie
But I'm the greatest asian rapper ever to be alive
And if you disagree just dig a hole, lay down, and go die
I'm gon' be rich and all my niggas gon' have on suit and ties
And if you talk down the ting gon' bring the heat, then let's go and fight
You is so stupid pussy boy you do not care 'bout your life

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Okay, I fuck her and leave her
I wanted a threesome
That bitch wasn't legal
But I am not legal
She wanted a feature
But I had to teach her
To suck it and squeeze it
That bitch is bulimic
Okay, I fuck her and leave her
I wanted a threesome
That bitch wasn't legal
But I am not legal
She wanted a feature
So I had to teach her
To suck it and squeeze it
That bitch is bulimic

[Verse 2: Warhol.ss]
Oou, undercover with the Rick
And ya aunty in the dirt
Zipper, she grab on my dick
My dick'll back up and park
30-round came with a drum for real
I cannot kid or stunt for real
Percocet, popping these mollies and pill
Roll down, rollie, I don't rock no grill
AP, get chills
Eight feet, get spilled
Six feet, quick kill
Wrist, check on me like a doc
Fuckin' that hoe and her mama
Cookin' up just like Betty Crocker
Puttin' niggas in the trash, trash bag
These niggas be stealin' swag, swag, swag
Came [?] for the cat, cat, cat
In the Margiela I sag, sag, sag
Hoe you be tat, tat, tat, oou
Let the mac blast
Blowin' the gas bag
[?]
Rari, it ride fast

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Okay, I fuck her and leave her
I wanted a threesome
That bitch wasn't legal
But I am not legal
She wanted a feature
So I had to teach her
To suck it and squeeze it
That bitch is bulimic

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I am a predator, just like hyena
Yo bitch off the loud like we just smoked some speakers
I think that I'm hot, like I just caught a fever
So I keep a liter of lean in the freezer
How does she back it up, she must have a reverse camera, from Alabama
It was your mama, then I met your auntie out in Atlanta
She hit the folks on my dick for a Fanta
No, I'm Dirty Dan!
I'm rich and degenerate
Fuck you if that flag you got is confederate
I let yo' bitch fuck if she pay ya' settlement

[Chorus: KiD TRUNKS]
Okay, I fuck her and leave her
I wanted a threesome
That bitch wasn't legal
But I am not legal
She wanted a feature
But I had to teach her
To suck it and squeeze it
That bitch is bulimic
I fuck her and leave her
I wanted a threesome
That bitch wasn't legal
But I am not legal
She wanted a feature
So I had to teach her
To suck it and squeeze it
That bitch is bulimic

[Verse 4: A$AP ANT]
Babygirl, look at the kicks
Gucci, don't step on my kicks
Sippin' codeine like I'm sick
Cream soda the lean that I mix
Niggas be dissin' they no
Niggas they really be Urkels
Grippin' the chopper I hurt you
I don't need no squares in my circle
Fuckin' that bitch from the back, oou
Diamonds they froze, I feel cool
Sippin the purple oven, oou
Bitch she lookin', she's hella cute
[?]
Bob the Builder, I stay with the tool
If you beef, you're gonna lose
Fuckin' your bitch, I don't mean to be rude
Gettin' the money, I spend it on Prada
Gettin' the money, I spend it on Gucci
If you can't beat me you better salute me
