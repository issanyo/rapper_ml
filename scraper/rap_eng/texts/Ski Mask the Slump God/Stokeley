[Intro: DirtyFaceSmook & Ski Mask The Slump God]
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
No we ain't friends, no we ain't homies
You don't want DirtyFace you only want Stokeley
DJ Creative Mind came to hit 'em upside the head with that fye
I'm probably with Ski Mask too, bitch
Don't tell nobody, ooh

[Chorus: DirtyFaceSmook & Ski Mask The Slump God]
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey (ayy!)
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
No we ain't friends, no we ain't homies
You don't want DirtyFace, you only want Stokeley
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
No we ain't friends, no we ain't homies
You don't want DirtyFace, you only want Stokeley (ayy!)

[Verse 1: DirtyFaceSmook]
Stop tryna fuck with Dirty, just to get the Stokes
This goes for these niggas and these dusty ass hoes
I don't wanna have to shoot you, I really don't wanna have to do it
But I live what I say in this music, keep a .30 on me and I use it
I throw my little brother a pack, that nigga gon' move it
Got water on my wrist, lil bitch, it's like we cruising
I bought myself a chain, not a car because I Uber
I hit it from the back, sip a four and now I'm snoozing
They used to hate a nigga now they wanna be with the movement
I told you I was winning lil bitch, and now you losing
Clout chasing bitches, boy I swear them hoes is useless
Coming through my squad, lil bitch, you just a nuissance

[Chorus: DirtyFaceSmook & Ski Mask The Slump God]
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey (ayy!)
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey (wet, flex)
No we ain't friends, no we ain't homies
You don't want DirtyFace, you only want Stokeley
(In the flesh, hey)
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
When that choppa hit you, do the hokey pokey
No we ain't friends, no we ain't homies
You don't want DirtyFace, you only want Stokeley

[Verse 2: DirtyFaceSmook]
Told her, "swallow my jits"
Bitch swallow my jits
I'll come to your party
With a thirty round clip
Thirty bitches with me
While I look like a pimp
I'll walk in your party
With all of this drip
Told her, "swallow my kids"
Told her, "swallow my drips"
Told her, "swallow my kids"
Don't give me no kiss
Gang, gang, gang gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang gang
Gang, gang gang, gang
Where the fuck is Frieza?

[Outro: DJ Creative Mind]
