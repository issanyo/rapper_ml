[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God & RyBundy]
Tied, light 'eem up!
Bitch, yuh
And my chain wet, yuh
Just like sex, ayy
Pulled up on 'em, yeah
Bitch, ayy
Ayy, hey!

[Verse 1]
Suck on my dick, when she suck on my dick
Sound like pop from the top of a Snapple (Bitch)
Your swag be tacky, your knee caps be ashy (Wet)
Some lotion is what you should tackle (Okay)
Try comb your hair, sound like bite from an apple
While I be fly like pterodactyl (Yuh)
I'm in this bitch and I'm all in dem buns
Like I started off as a damn cattle (Okay)
Pussy what I love to battle (Bitch)
Dick long like needle in Seattle (Yuh)
Top rope elbow (Top)
How I hit the pussy, R.K.O., put it in a choke hold
Backwards redrum (Red)
'Cause my diamonds throwing temper tantrum
Tell your mother that my name Chris, Iâ€™ll tuck her (Tuck, tuck)

[Chorus]
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy, bring that pussy
I'ma lean, rock with it, lean
Rock, lean, rock, bitch, lean
Rock, hey, lean, rock with it, lean
Rock with it, bitch
Rock with it, ayy!

[Verse 2]
If I said I get it, then I get it (Get it)
If I said I'm with it, then I'm with it
Bitch I'm in the old screamin' free XXX
If a nigga said it then I meant it
When I run it up I need a minute
Minivan Jigglypuff finish
Rack up on me like I play some tennis
And I pop designer goggles and they fit me like a chemist
Okay like
At the top, sticking to it
Like a tater-tot (Diamonds!)
Whip cleared the block
Like I put wheels on the Glock (Hot wheels)
Captain Spock hand salute, how she move the crotch
Water Bayou, like I buy new bezels on my watch

[Chorus]
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy to the crew
It'll be rude if you don't show that pussy, bring that pussy
(Lean back like Fat Joe)
Lean, rock with it, lean
Rock, lean, rock, yuh, lean
Rock, ayy, lean, rock with it, lean
Rock with it, bitch
Rock with it, ayy!
