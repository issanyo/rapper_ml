[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & GrownBoiTrap]
Lanlord in the building
Ayyyyyyye! Hahaha!
I seen yo bitch, at the Walgreens she wanted suck my dick in the back (no cap, yuh)
Well I did it and came on her face
Told her "get the fuck outta here" (Look at it, look at it)
Ouu!
Ay Ay

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ay baby put that pecker on my wood in the whip, yup, Bat Mobile
I'm gon' drink that pussy like my lean, put my thumb in and pop that seal
I heard she could make that booty clap
Yup, louder than a wetback seal
Ew, ew, ew, what I say when I see yo bitch, why she lookin' like a jailhouse meal?
Like, wrist like, Klondike, flow hard, never-right
Gold on me like I'm CeeLo Green on the Grammys night
Catch me, outside, we can joust, knife fight
I do not rock diamonds, I wear crystals made of Kryptonite

[Hook]
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy

[Verse: GrownBoiTrap]
I ain' wanna do it but I had to, uh
Choppa aimed at you, ayy
Is she callin' my name, she callin' my name, bit' like I'm callin' you, ayy
She say she sing in the mornin', ayy
She singing at me, Erykah Badu, ayy
You ain't talkin' money, bitch, I'mma stand like a statue, uh
Yuh, I ain't wanna fuck but I did it
Hit that bit' now quit it
Pussy [?] yo' fitted
My diamond's water, bitch is liquid
Racks on me, ice on me, my diamonds so wet, ouu
Love to stunt, love to shine, I flex on my ex
I don't fly first class
In a private jet
I'm straight out the block
I'm straight out the 'jects

[Chorus]
Ay baby put that pecker on my wood in the whip, yup, Bat Mobile
I'm gon' drink that pussy like my lean, put my thumb in and pop that seal
I heard she could make that booty clap
Yup, louder than a wetback seal
Ew, ew ,ew, what I say when I see yo bitch, why she lookin' like a jailhouse meal?
Like, wrist like, Klondike, flow hard, never-right
Gold on me like I'm CeeLo Green on the Grammys night
Catch me, outside, we can joust, knife fight
I do not rock diamonds, I wear crystals made of Kryptonite

[Hook]
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
Hold up, hold up, bitch, I ain't wanna do it but I had to, ayy
