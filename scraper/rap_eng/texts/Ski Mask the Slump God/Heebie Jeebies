[Intro: Splash Zanotti & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hey Ski I can't fuck with these niggas man
These niggas give me the goosebumps
These niggas give me the heebie jeebies
We still goin'?
Rock on that booty she cutie
She don't got the cooties

[Chorus: Splash Zanotti]
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies
I count up the money, let's get it, let's get it
Nigga you ain't from my city, my city
Them MIA niggas, they all comin' with me
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies
I count up the money, let's get it, let's get it
Nigga you ain't from my city, my city
Them MIA niggas, they all comin' with me
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, look

[Verse 1: Splash Zanotti]
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies
Can't fuck with you niggas, you niggas is creepy
Count up the money until I get sleepy
Eyes open 'cause these niggas is greasy
Goin' off a perc and I make it look easy
Gave yo' bitch molly and now she is sleazy
My homie is slidin', will turn you to pieces
Walk on the water, I beat that up Jesus
Splash, watch how I go get the cash
Watch how a young nigga smash
Smellin' weed up in the air
And she left her underwear
So I go get the money ain't fuckin' these hoes
Finessin' these niggas I'm still with my bros
Nigga they know I got blow for the low
If you don't got no money you know how that go

[Chorus: Splash Zanotti]
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies
I count up the money, let's get it, let's get it
Nigga you ain't from my city, my city
Them MIA niggas, they all comin' with me
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies
I count up the money, let's get it, let's get it
Nigga you ain't from my city, my city
Them MIA niggas, they all comin' with me
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, okay
Haters they give me the heebies, the jeebies, ayy, look

[Verse 2: DIRTYFACESMOOK]
I'm high as fee-fi-fo-fum
One car, two niggas, three guns
I got a pump, no asthma, aim it at yo' lungs
Don't you dare say you movin' bricks
Lil' bitch, every Glock got extended clips
Lil' bitch, gimme top, dick on the lips
She hot, got a brand new yellow bitch
Oh my, Twitter thot crave dirty dick
No lie, we gon' pull up, we gon' let it rip
You die, bye bye, no NSYNC
Minimalist fly high, Jim Jones face
Oh wow, she lovin' the way I be spazzin'
If I die put three hoes in my casket
Come to the block you ain't gettin' no passes
[?] as molasses

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Nextel, hit my cell
Smokin' that dragon, no fairytale
Fuck is you talkin', I'm Very Rare
Fuck on a bitch and I smoke a square
Very conceptual, sniper rare
Reindeer, no fear
Huntin' you niggas, no pigtails
Got yo' bitch wet like a fish scale
Wet wet wet wet wet
I know you need a towel, diamonds dripping no sweat
Ass up on my chest, how I threw the pussy in the air no sex
Nigga need a lick I'm 'bout to hit another lick
Too much sauce [?]
I'm a bad boy, Young Diddy, niggas keep it flippin' in the city
Humble, get that bitch wet like a sunk boat
Rub on my bitch like a lump soap
Rub on my bitch like a lump soap, humble
I got the keys like a bump, I got the keys like a bump
Hop on that bitch like a lump, who

[Outro: RyBundy]
Hi my name is Ryan
You might wanna turn this the fuck up
Slap this shit on your motherfuckin' 808s
