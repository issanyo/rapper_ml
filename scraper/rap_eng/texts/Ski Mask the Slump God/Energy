[Intro]
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
Hey, hey (for my energy)
Haha, are you ready? ('Cause my enemies)
My name is Ski Pack The Bump God
Welcome to the virus, yeah, huh, hahaha (think you can have it?)
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it

[Chorus]
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it, bitch

[Bridge]
Ayy, fwoof
I just busted motherfucking sweat in this bitch
I feel like Keith Sweat
Hahahahaha, ayy

[Verse]
I'm like fuck you, fuck that
Rollin' like a hubcap
Only way you gon' blow up is if you fuckin' light a stick match
Siamese cat, how the pussy look
It's on point just like a thumb tack
Even if it wasn't I got my stick
Like an old man cane and backpack
Ayy, just like a boomerang, yuh
Dick come back whip her like Pootie Tang, uh
Know my flow taken, no wedding ring, uh

[Chorus]
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it, bitch

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it
I'm too gone, mind too strong
Gold tooth on, sing this melody
For my energy, 'cause my enemies
Want the death of me, I will never see it, bitch
