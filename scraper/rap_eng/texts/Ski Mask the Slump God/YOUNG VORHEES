[Intro]
Like T.I.P. I got my hat slant on this bitch
Like Lebron hairline, lets see a slant on this bitch
(Watch where you're going you fool)
Shake and bake, shake and bake, shake and bake
Poke the holes, poke the holes, poke the holes
Shake and bake, aye

[Verse 1]
Feel like Frozone "where my super suit?"
My wrist cold
I can't hold that bitch like sipping soup up outta po'
Talking bout money better get right
Split ya ass open like a fucking Klondike
Then I hit em wit a (huh huh) Suge Knight
Then I climb on his bitch like mountain bike
Wrist piss
That's that Johnny Dang
Christmas, couple hoes up on my thang
Hit this, this that good purp
Girl you Icky Vicky
I don't want your germs

[Chorus]
Young Voorhees sippin porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage
Young Voorhees sippin porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage

[Verse 2]
Pimp Named Slickback bitch back back
You need a tic tac, smell like quarterback
Y-3 flip flops where'd you get that at
Dave the Barbarian leopard skin mats
Pussy stay chasing me like Tom the Cat
VR ALL-STARS pass it pass it back
Xtentacion's playing wit' them racks
Lil ll√†ri want a rarri
Matt fucking sclat (skrrt skrrt skrrt)

[Chorus]
Young Voorhees sippin porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage
Young Voorhees sippin porridge
Out of Versace bowls like a lord bitch
When I'm in the pussy I got courage
That's why she ask for my hand in marriage
