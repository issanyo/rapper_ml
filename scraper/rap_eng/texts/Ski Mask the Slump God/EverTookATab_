[Intro]
Orlando Brown is my spirit animal
You know I give her that
Mmm-bop-m-blpa-ba-doo-op-blblbblblaaah
Hello moto!
Simple!

[Verse 1]
Pussy golden put my mouth on it like trumpet
I be sippin on that Wockhardt, while I'm eatin on a crumpet
Venue lookin like final fantasy, final destination that moshpit
Spartacus kick take cocaine till' she carcass
Nigga don't call us los bolas grandes cause a model bitch a heavy drool
Water all around the ice up on me like I'm sub zero in the pool
They ask why I am so fresh, they still sayin I am stool
"Have you seen my soul?"
You should check the lost and found in the back room

[Chorus]
OK like AK kickback
Acid in my vat
X and O's what yo hoe ask for like we playin' tic tac toe
AK kickback
Acid in my vat
X and O's what yo hoe ask for like we playin' tic tac toe

[Verse 2]
Like look up in yo eyes
I see bags, you tired
Look right back at mine
I got eye of the tiger (grrr)
21 issa knife
I am no Michael Myers
Draco pack a punch
Call of duty, my fire
Ok like, I need four bitches
Jus like the Cheetah Girls or just like The Coven
That pussy fire
Just to damn touch it need mits like a oven
X is my brother
From 'notha mother
He know that I love him (FREE HIM)
Nigga ride a dick
They musta learned from they muhfuckin mother

[Chorus]
OK like AK kickback
Acid in my vat
X and O's what yo hoe ask for like we playin' tic tac toe
AK kickback
Acid in my vat
X and O's what yo hoe ask for like we playin' tic tac toe
