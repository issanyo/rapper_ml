Natra

[Chorus: Danny Towers & Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm geekin', geekin'
I can't feel my face, I'm geekin'
She gon' give me face, she eatin'
She gon' give me face, she eatin'
I'm geekin' (geeking), geekin' (geeking)
I can't feel my face, I'm geekin' (geeking)
She gon' give me face, she eatin' (she eating)
My dick and her mouth, have a meetin' (hey!)

[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God & Danny Towers]
I been swimming out there in the deep end
But that's not the reason that I'm freezin' (freezing)
I just copped me new ice for the weekend (weekend)
And just like my mixtape, that bitch leakin' (hey!)
I'm rolling, pistol-toting (water!)
My flow like the ocean feel the motion
But that's not the reason that I'm boastin' (that I'm boasting)
50 on the VVs and they frozen, ayee
At night like Nick, huh
I made them sick, huh
Drop the top on my whip, motherfucker look at this mad trick, huh
Name not Michael Vick, huh
Told my dogs to just sit, huh
Bitch suck my dick (suck my)
I squirt like squid (I squirt like)
French fries, Iâ€™m crisp, huh
Gone with the wind, huh
If the situation gettin hairy yeah, give that a trim, huh
Elbow in a rim, huh
Oh yeah that's him, bitch!

[Chorus: Danny Towers & Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm geekin' (geeking), geekin' (geeking)
I can't feel my face, I'm geekin' (geeking)
She gon' give me face, she eatin' (she eating)
She gon' give me face, she eatin' (hey!)
I'm geekin', geekin' (geeking)
I can't feel my face, I'm geekin' (freezing)
She gon' give me face, she eatin' (eating)
My dick and her mouth, have a meetin' (water!)
