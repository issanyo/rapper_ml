[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Passive aggressive, passion
Mixed up with bad shit
So smoke this and get so high
Forget where the ash at
I'm laughing at your [?]
Get my money first
And my pockets is on the day
Yours is looking hurt
Over pressured, I do hurt, bitch
Leaving you niggas in fetal
Position bitch I am leaving
Weapon like my name is Dixon
Get hit with Ritalin if you feel froggy
My plug is bilingual, speak trap when I come in
Might eat me some shrooms in the forest, ignore us
I explore her body, she call me her tourist

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God]
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan through zones
My love is a Xan
My love is a Xan, my love is a Xan
Falco here, I'm fine (here)

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION]
I'm fine
Two blunts, fuck your time
Ecstasy when I'm tired
But it be the conjuring when I'm high
I lied, go to hell when I die
Pussy motherfuckers will fry
Glock and 99 lives go bye, die
Right, victims killed the same
Its an hour late
It's the tone when we suffocate
This is out-fucking-rageous
Many will be fucking slaughtered in front of doctors
The pavement, no one can save them
Oh Father, take them

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wells Fargo shorty here to fuck up the party, ayy
Bandana shorty, never fucking say I'm sorry, ayy
Shh, if I want your shit then I take it
But yo don't feel bad, need more wrist game than bracelet
I'm feeling like Grace 'cause nigga I'm amazing
I pop me a Xan and forget my location
I fuck me a bitch and go get a replacement
I got that 4 for the low, so I pour up on hoes
So bitch take a photo while I glow up
Smoking weed same color throw up
Like to get high but don't smoke, blunts
She only smoke papers I fuck with her
She roll my blunts, then we go fuck
