[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
They wildin' out, ayy!
Huh, woke up on a cloud of sauce
Wet, that's better
I need my water
I just be sick, sick, sick
I just be sick, sick, sick (ayy)
I just be sick, sick, sick
I just be sick like a sneeze (yuh)
I just be sick like a sneeze (huh, huh)
I just be sick like a sneeze (huh, huh, ayy, I am replenished)
I just be sick, sick, sick (water!)
I just be sick, sick, sick (ayy, sick like a pimple)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I just be sick like a sneeze (huh, huh)
I just be sick like a sneeze (huh, huh, sick like a what?)
I just be sick like a sneeze (huh, sick like I'm who?)
I just be sick like a sneeze (ayy, sick like I'm who?)
I just be sick, sick, sick (huh, huh)
Diamonds, they sick, sick, sick (huh)
My jewelry is cool just like a breeze
I just be sick like a sneeze, huh
I just be sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick (achoo)
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick (ouch, ouch)
I just be sick like a sneeze, ooh (walk up in the club, ayy)
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick (just like a pimple, look at it)
Diamonds, they sick, huh, yuh
I just be sick like a sneeze (wa-wa-wa-wa-wa, ayy)

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Water (yuh, ayy, ayy, ayy ayy ayy)
Just like a pimple (just like a—)
Just like a nipple (just like a—)
Ayy, never gave a fuck, uh (ayy, back still hurt)
I don't give a fuck (huh)
Never will give a fuck (huh)
Ayy!

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
My diamonds, they cool like a breeze
I just be sick like a sneeze
Oh my god, Jesus, Reese's in the pieces
Peanut butter colored LV, huh (ayy)
I just be fistin', all on your missus
This is a vengeance, R. Kelly fetus
And I rap in season 'cause don't need a reason
To bust open a gun at your knees, bitch (what? Wow)
I'm like wow-zer (wow, wow)
She don't want me gouge her (gouge, gouge)
Pussy, 'cause my dick, it large (it)
Just like a McDonalds fries, sir (make it)
My bitch is a witch, but when on me, don't catch a curse
Goyard on me, they can't afford but they call it purse
I didn't think this shit washed your pocket more than Allure
Hol' up, bitch, my money is so—

[Bridge: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Sick, sick, sick
My money, sick, sick, sick
My money, sick, sick, sick
My money, sick like a sneeze
My money, sick like a sneeze
My money, sick like a sneeze
My bitch is sick like a sneeze
My diamonds—
Ayy!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Keith Ape]
I just be sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick
I just be sick, sick, sick
I just be sick like a sneeze, huh
My jewelry is cool like a breeze, huh
I just be sick like a sneeze (ayy, yah)
My jewelry is cool just like a breeze (ayy, yah)
I just be sick like a sneeze (ayy, yah)
Bitch (ayy, yah)

[Verse 2: Keith Ape]
얼어붙어 버린 팔찌
손목에는 얼음 장식 (e-yeah-e)
난 바닷물 과다 섭취 (e-yeah-e)
마치 범고래 된 것 같이 (yuh, yuh)
나는 셀 수 없는 돈을 원해 (ayy)
보물이 내 목을 조르려 해 (ayy)
나는 걸어 다니는 범고래 (ayy)
물방울이 나의 온몸에
내 주먹에는 보석이
Milo 얼굴 모양 목걸이 (yah)
Bapesta 별 모양 귀걸이 (yah)
온몸에서 끊임없이 뿜어, 빛 (yah)
내 식구들은 pull up with a beam (yah)
내 친구들과 poppin' on some beans (yah)
나는 피고, 날아, 하늘 위 (yah)
너무 가까워, 보여, 하늘이 (yah, ayy, ayy, yah)
여긴 너무 가까워, 보여, 하늘이 (yuh)
고소공포증, 불안정해, 나의 마음이 (ayy)
내 통장에는 절대 오지 않아, 가뭄이 (yuh)
Bape랑 명품들이 전부 내 장바구니에 (ayy, yah)
여긴 너무 가까워, 보여, 하늘이 (yuh)
고소공포증, 불안정해, 나의 마음이 (ayy)
내 통장에는 절대 오지 않아, 가뭄이 (yuh)
Bape랑 명품들이 전부 내 장바구니에 (yuh, yuh, ayy)
Ayy, 난 보름달 쳐다본 손오공 (yuh)
내 두 손에 쥐어진 여의봉 (yuh)
적들을 향해서 쏜 원기옥 (yuh)
난 근두운을 타고 저 멀리로 (yuh, ayy)
Sippin' on the wock, and I'm laid back, ayy (whoa, yuh)
Rollin' up the woods, and I like that, ayy (yuh)
Rollie on my wrist, yeah, I like that, ayy (whoa)
Broke-ass ninja, I don't like that, yuh (yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy)

[Bridge: Keith Ape & Ski Mask The Slump God]
My money, sick, sick, sick
My money, sick, sick, sick (sick)
My money, sick, sick, sick (sick)
My money, sick like a sneeze, ayy (sick, sneeze)
My money, sick like a sneeze, yuh (sneeze, sneeze)
My money, sick like a sneeze, ayy (sneeze, sneeze)
My bitch is sick like a sneeze, ayy (sneeze, sneeze)
My bitch— My money— (Ayy, sick, sick)
Yuh (ayy)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I just be sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick
I just be sick, sick, sick
I just be sick like a sneeze, huh
My jewelry is cool like a breeze, huh
I just be sick like a sneeze
My jewelry is cool just like a breeze
I just be sick like a sneeze

[Outro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch!
