[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
Gang, gang, gang
My name is Ski Mask the Slump God and you are now watching Montreality, and it's lit, bitch
Montreality, evil twin shit, ayy

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
You know what? Some new shit, it's like
Poison ivy, nobody is fuckin' with me
My flow, it float like butterfly, sting like bee
I got some—, got one question, can I proceed?
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yes indeed
Off the gelato, reppin' the throttle, mhmm
I'm at the top like the next model, mhmm
Sp—, Spanish bitch fuckin' me, that my vato, mhmm, mhmm
Mhmm, mhmm
Like guys like five though when I ride though
'Cause they want the beef, no chicken, lettuce or fries though
Dick like horn, top of rhino
Two different co—, two different color bitches with me, tie dye though (mm)
Niggas be always borrowin' the sauce like, "ouch," though (mm)
Catch me outside, be buzzin' like a fly though (mm)
That's how you feel?
Definitely

[Interlude: Juice WRLD]
This is somethin' that—
Y'all, I don't even know if I even turn it into a song
But it's the realest shit I ever wrote though
I say

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Don't let the tight clothes decept you
Won't hesitate to pull up and disrespect you
It ain't no help you can get to, until the police find you where my nu—, young niggas left you, huh
You better play your cards right
Bitch, why shoot? Got a brand new jackknife
Knowin' damn well that you ain't 'bout that life
Tell me why the fuck you tryna act hard
Knowin' damn well you don't crack cards
Knowin' damn well if I stand in your backyard it ain't no danger
Ricochet your bullets
You a Cutler ass nigga, I'm just gettin' on my sack yards
Freestyle flows, no write it, see future, no psychic
She ride it like a bike did, she strapped up like a dyke, bitch
She do coke like a white bitch, I do it too 'cause I like it
Flexed up, huh
Next up, gettin' neck from your chick, yeah, huh
Chin check with this TEC, make you hiccup, huh
Go hard like a five on five, basketball game
Fuckin' with us, you get picked up, uh
Like weights in the gym, I will lift up, huh
R. Kelly in the cut, get my piss up, huh
You get pissed on, huh, with the pistol, huh
Like a autograph, shit, I initial, huh

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
Hold on
You sweet like cannoli or maybe Fruit Roll-Ups
My pockets allergic, that's why they are swollen
'Cause money stuffed in 'em, I might just go bowlin'
I think outside the box (yeah)
She thinkin'— (Haha)
She- (Haha)

[Outro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Juice WRLD]
To be completely honest, we're both the evil twin, at some points, though (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cuz we're way- we're both- we're both really nice, but then we're both evil at the same damn time (At the same time)
Like Future, bitch, no future bitch
So come try to fuck us and then you'll see that we're evil at the same damn time (Yeah, facts though)
No cap
