[Intro]
Boot in the booth, booth in the booth, boot in the, uh, yuh
Boot in the booth, boot in the, yuh, bitch
Now my wrist said she fucked me for my handkerchief
And I ain't fucking with these niggas like a feminist
Hey! (Where the fuck is your hairline?!) VR! ALL-STARS!

[Verse]
Assassin's Creed, won't respect the thief
'Cause I won't let you pocket my sauce
Thought I told them once so I had to tell them twice
All up in this bitch pussy like I'm Rick Ross
Murder by the cross, told him better fear for his life
21 voice nigga, issa knife, cut 'em
Sauce no butters, wet no gutters
Ed Hardy fitted like a trucker motherfucker
Lean I cut her, and I sip it like some utters
Got gas like a lactose Cheerio lover
