[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God & 458Keez]
Made me think of-
Fuckin' horror movies (what, what, what?)
I had to crack the-
VR
Crack it, I'm back it (I had to!)
Oh my God, Ronny
Yuh, ayy

[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God]
My diamond' glow in the dark, my coupe, uh
Top on that bih, let it drop, my heart too, uh
All black like Batmobile or Toothless
I had to crack the seal
Maybe 'cause it made me fuckin' think of horror movies, uh
My diamond' glow in the dark, my coupe, uh
Top on that bih, let it drop, my heart too
All black like Batmobile or Toothless
I had to crack the seal
Maybe 'cause it made me fuckin' think of horror movies, uh

[Verse 1: 458Keez]
Now my diamonds on loop-de-loop
She suck on my cock and then go and kiss you, hey
[?] and buck, and fuck on that thot like a remedy, yeah
Hey, you really think that your girl
She ride on the dick like a hula hoop
Fuck on her and then saw her mans
They gotta back up like, "who are you?"
Bitch I'm on it, you can't clone it
Runnin' four flat, big performance
I'm gonna finish her, finish her,  Mortal Kombat
Remember not havin' no money so I had to go and find that
Little bitch watch it, you had your hand deep in my pockets
I'm thinking about signing your copy
And then we will not have a problem
I got the pistol, its poppin'
And I'm still bustin' this watch
These niggas they all try to copy
[?] can stop me

My diamond' glow in the dark (ayy), my coupe, uh
Top on that bih, let it drop, my heart too (ayy)
All black like Batmobile (ayy), or Toothless (yuh)
I had to crack the seal
Maybe 'cause it made me fuckin' think of horror movies

[Verse 2: Wifisfuneral]
Ayy, hold up, two 10s in my system like wrists when they pushin'
I came from roaches, no cookie
Pop on the top like a skill, ayy
And cut the wings, roach hit the coupe, ayy
One on the top to his head
If they gon' aim, they might as well shoot, ooh
Diamonds too glitter, that money keep flowin'
I'm workin' the digits, I'm workin' the digits
Like all I know run to a check, I think I'm Forrest Gump in the loop
I turn her face to a painting, think I'm Picasso, check how I do, ayy
Rubber band poppin' like pimples, don't need ProActive, wh-
Rubber bands poppin' like pimples, don't need ProActive
Know how I do

My diamond' glow in the dark, my coupe, uh
Top on that bih, let it drop, my heart too, uh
All black like Batmobile or Toothless
