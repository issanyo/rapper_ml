[Intro: Cooliecut]
Natra
Feel empty, feel empty, yeah, I feel empty

[Chorus: Cooliecut]
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)

[Verse 1: Craig Xen]
It's been 70 hours since I buried my brother
Still ain't talked to my mother yet
Been a mess and I look at life as why it couldn't be I
Why it had to be my lil' brother Jah
Too often to been the one that create change, they take from us
In prison, in these chains is stuck to our wrists
And my eyes glisten when I'm reminiscin'
In my head droppin', I'm reminded that I'm empty

[Chorus: Cooliecut]
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)

[Verse 2: Kin$oul]
Lost in the system, still playing the victim
Born in the world, thinkin', "Why am I livin'"
Stuck in my conscience
All the time's we been talkin'
Rapping, laughing, and moshing
Spitting flames in the closet
Sadness, anger, and madness
Seeing you in that casket
You was my fucking brother (You was my fucking brother)
You was a fucking savage (You was a fucking savage)

[Interlude: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh

[Verse 3: Ski Mask the Slump God]
And I'm constantly rushed
By my conscience and demons
Recall, once was at peace, took a fall
Now is in pieces, I bawled
Cried and I weeped for Jah
Vision I seeked so bold
Alone we're weak, but we're strong together, see, haha
The rain still continues to fall, pain continues to call
Sayin' not much of at all, so balance is where I'll start
I know they judging my heart, can't even blame 'em at all
I know I fucked up, and I'll apologize for my flaws
Lost on a train made of thought
I hope my end is my start
I hope that Jah see my heart
I know I'm god in my mind
But God is still who I call, all in all

[Chorus: Cooliecut]
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
Woke up feeling empty, I feel empty, yeah, I feel empty (Empty)
