[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch, I am wuh-wuh-wuh wuh-wuh-wuh one of a one
Hot like a biscuit with crust on the crumb
I touch her chest like the cross on a nun
Umm, umm (I touch ya chest, it, it, it, it, I touch ya chest, it, it, it, it)
If I was vampire, I still survive in the sun
I am a motherfucker, asshole and cunt
My diamonds clean as a newborn baby dog tongue, umm

[Verse 2: Rich the Kid]
Pussy too good like yum (Like what, what?)
Make her do a backflip, then she cum (Huh?)
Choppers on 'em run up on it get shot (Grahh)
Thirty bitches, I'mma do what I want (Bitch)
She wanna fuck on my neck, 'cause I'm cool (Water)
If the pussy too good, make it blue (Make it blue)
Use to dream 'bout the Bentley, till the shit came true
Got a brand new Rollie and the face all blue

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God & Rich The Kid]

Block, block, block, block, block, what, drop, huh?
Slatt, slatt, slatt slatt

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm just like slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt (Ooh)
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Shout out my slime and my ex
I'm just like slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt (Uh, yuh)
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Shout out my slime and my ex

[Verse 3: Ski Mask The Slump God & Rich The Kid]
Cause you know they help me blow up
Bitch, it's throw up
What's on my meat? Boy no cold cut
Shout out my Bentley (Skrrt)

What's in your freezer? (Freezer)
Bitch I'm froze up
She want the Molly, thought she told ya?
Shout out my bitch (Bitch)
'Cause she cold
I got the racks in my backpack (Backpack)
Bluebills on me, that's a kickback (Kickback)
I'm the young nigga bought the trap back (What?)
You can fit a hundred thou in a knapsack (Rich)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm just like slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt (Ooh)
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
