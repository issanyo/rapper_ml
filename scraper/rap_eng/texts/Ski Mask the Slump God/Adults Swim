[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah, ooh, hah
You woke? Yes sir
Yes, sir
ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoney
Okay, what you say?

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, common sense is to compromise
When everybody 'round you talking nice
That is a yes man, recognize
Yeah, uh, I am appalled by the battles I fight
I let them all think a nigga too nice
Like when a nigga say his dog don't bite
Yeah, uh, I shake shit like a lime in a coconut
Smoking dark green weed, my bitch call it ogre nut
Forbidden fruit in my diet, get your wisdom up
Yeah, huh, I'm like shucks, shit, shawty got a big butt
Clout is a hell of a drug, that's why she give suck
Bitch, I think I'm MC and Hammer because you can't touch
Ooh, what you do?
Pour the Henny like a soup (Uh)
Psst, black lagoon, where I'm from, animal
Nickelodeon, with my slimes, let 'em ooze
Like when Stella, bought Margiela, I got back my groove
You is a square like in a Rubik's
All on my dick like the hair on my pubic
She said, she ready, look at her stupid
'Cause she got a diaper booty like Cupid
Water how I move, liquid, let's do it
Money how I talk, bitch, I speak fluent
Smokin' on stank, you smell like a sewer
How was you feeling, vro? Bitch, like the Four

[Chorus]
Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)
But they tryna fuck up my mood (Ooh)
Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)
You fuck up the cool in my mood (Ooh)
Like say moo, black white fur
Designer jacket cover my nude, uh
Take it serious, that's it period (That's it)
Don't fuck up my groove (That's it, that's it)
Like haiku, I speak smooth (Ooh)
But they tryna fuck up my mood (Ooh)
Thought we cool, but when you round (Ooh)
You fuck up the cool in my mood (Ooh)
Like say moo, black white fur
Designer jacket cover my nude, uh
Take it serious, that's it period (Ooh)
Don't fuck up my groove (Yeah)
