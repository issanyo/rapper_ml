[Intro]
Ronny J listen up

[Verse 1: Lofty305]
This that Zu shit
Suwoo maroon shit
Nigga talkin' all that shit but they ain't really doin' it
Niggas say that he a goon
He ain't tryna prove it
CSPG be the movement, free Ruben

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry]
This that motherfuckin' Zu shit
But this that new shit
I never gave a fuck like I'm a prude, bitch
Just know I do's this
Your stuff drier than a prune, bitch
Hit up with the pool stick
My bullets they un-acoustic
Free Nell and free Slikk

[Verse 3: Lofty305]
And that purp gettin' smoked, put that on my broom stick
Cultivating all the racks off these fuckin' 'shrooms, bitch
Metro Zu we go to ATL
You know we boomin'
Put yo' bitch right on a track
Ronny J produced it

[Verse 5: XXXTENTACION]
You a fuck nigga

Wig split, peel 'em

Body dumped in my trunk, bitch
Glock by my dick
If you tweak, I'ma stick, ayy
Fuck do you mean?
Aim that beam at your spleen
If you Purrp, I'll put your face in the dirt
Like pussy, you get creamed
Ayy (wet, wet, wet)

[Verse 6: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Princess Peach jewelry my bitch
Red, white, black Pok√©ball might beep
Beep-boop-beep, Go gadget my wrist
Bling-bling-blow, Johnny Dang my fist
Wet that pussy up just like a drop and then I dip
I done beat that pussy to the blue, she not a crip
Diamonds on me red and they white, no zit
Master Roshi wit' it, I done pull up with a stick, wooh
Chopper put lines and I'm cheesin', mmm
Leave blood on the leaves like I'm Yeezus, mmm
I eat your soul for no reason, mmm
The way that she suck me is treason
Cook, cook, cook, mmm
Your grandma wan' poke me on Facebook
I want that booty, no Captain Hook
Wait, replay it
Let me hear it, let me hear it
