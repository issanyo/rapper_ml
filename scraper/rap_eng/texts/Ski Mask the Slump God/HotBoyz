[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
In a wraith, I just caught a case
Winning an award, had to keep that on my waist
On my face, I got that Johnny Dang
On my face, got Goyard on my waist
In a Wraith, I keep that on my waist
Ocean Drive, so I keep it MIA
Johnny Dang, I keep that in my chain
That's that blade, I feel like Gucci Mane

[Verse 1: Tyla Yaweh]
I wake up in the morning, get my cake
I just downed a Henny to my face
I just think I'm Slump I'm in the gates
I'm leanin' side to side call it faded
On a roll, I'm callin' out the shots
If you wanna book me, yes it's 15 for a show
Watchu want? That's what she want some blow
She boot it up, yeah she always on the go

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh & Ski Mask the Slump God]
In a wraith (Wraith)
I just caught a case (I just caught a case)
Winning an award (aye)
Had to keep that on my waist (on my waist)
On my face (face)
I got that Johnny Dang (face)
On my face (Dang, Dang)
Got Goyard on my waist (D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-ooh)
In a Wraith (what?)
I keep that on my waist (oof, oof)
Ocean Drive (water)
So I keep it MIA (aye, aye, hacky)
Johnny Dang (like your sacky)
I keep that in my chain (wet)
That's that blade (aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
I feel like Gucci Mane
(Look at it, look at it, look at it)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hacky sack, kick it dead
In the ribs no baby back
Call me back
I like big titties baby bottle but drink no Similac
Black don't crack, but my nigga shh
'Cause I know an African American that sell that
On my dick, she gon' sit
Just like the hero, diamonds flash
Gripping the metal just like Magneto
[?] an animal [?] peacoat
My wrist resembles Sub-Zero
Why does your pussy smell like Fritos?
Gripping the metal just like Magneto
[?] an animal [?] peacoat
My wrist resembles Sub-Zero
Why does your pussy smell like Fritos?

[Chorus: Tyla Yaweh]
In a wraith, I just caught a case
Winning an award, had to keep that on my waist
On my face, I got that Johnny Dang
On my face, got Goyard on my waist
In a Wraith, I keep that on my waist
Ocean Drive, so I keep it MIA
Johnny Dang, I keep that in my chain
That's that blade, I feel like Gucci Mane
