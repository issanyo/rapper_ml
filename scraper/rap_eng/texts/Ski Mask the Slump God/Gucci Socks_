Lyrics from Snippet
[Intro]
Huh, yuh

[Verse]
She said no nut November, for us, start December
Cause the way my face on her she sweat me like sweater
She tenderizes my meat but knows she not cooking dinner
It was [?] bands around me cuz' breath on her

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop!
Whatchu' doin'?
HUH!

[Chorus]
Rockin' Gucci socks with the Crocs
Rockin' Gucci socks with the Crocs
Real rich nigga, so my belly like pot of gold, lucky charm my watch
Rockin' Gucci socks with the Crocs
Rockin' Gucci socks with the Crocs
Down by the river now the alligator can't smoke the Gucci socks wit' them Crocs
