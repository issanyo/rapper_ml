[Intro]
It's Dre
'Cause I'm sippin' lean and soda
Said that Fed try pull me over (Doktor Avalanche!), not tonight
(ay let's get it!)

[Verse 1]
Said the Fed pulled me over, not tonight
Said the Fed caught me slippin', not tonight
Said that Fed try pull me over 'cause I'm sippin' lean and soda
Said that Fed try pull me over, not tonight

[Chorus]
Not tonight, not tonight (not tonight)
And if she want the pipe she gotta clap the thighs
Bitch I killed that show like Lincoln, and I said I just be drippin'
Like I'm made of wax and the A/C broke last weekend (hoo!)

[Verse 2]
Like a stripper bitch, I pulled up with the pole (pulled)
North Pole with the snow, red nose (red nose)
Hate these niggas like I'm Hitler, down-to-earth like I am litter
Sweet then sour, Sour Patch, I end up bitter, uhh (that's good)
If that ass fat then I'm Mike Tyson 'cause bit her (water)
Cool like glacier in the middle of December
Smokin' that killa, pass that Baretta, my nigga
You know I'm countin' them figures
I'm pulling triggers [?]
Metal on me, but no my name is not Bender (no not Bender!)
Took it with me on a date out with yo' sister (out with yo' sister!)
Pistol on me, eating steak (steak!)
Hey bitch this not Tinder date
She said she like me 'cause all of my diamonds like lakes (water!)

[Chorus]
Not tonight (not tonight), not tonight (not tonight)
If she want that pipe she gotta clap the thighs (not tonight)
I killed that show (not tonight), Lincoln, said that I be drippin'
Like I'm made of wax and the A/C broke last week (HUH, HUH)

[Outro]
Not tonight, not tonight
Not to- uh, huh huh, not tonight
Not tonight, not tonight
Not tonight, bitch!
