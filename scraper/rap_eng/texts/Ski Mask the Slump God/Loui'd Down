Bitches I fuck all belong to my foes
Then tell 'em get-get-get-get-get-get-going
Now 'less they got friends that gon' lick on my toes, oh, no, huh
Met a bitch who was a witch, them rituals up on my dick
Only involve things that is sexual, huh (huh)
That's in face, I shot my kiss, she go home, used to kiss your kiss
Don't put that pussy on a pedestal, huh! huh!
