Okay, bitch, I'm getting sweaty, huh
'Cause I'm getting heavy, uh

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Looking like A1 Pedico and I wipe her beak off
This should be illegal

Get to the back, like my name is Kris Kringle
Give 'em the finger, then show 'em the nina (then show 'em the nina, a-a-aye)

Bullets Iridium, Saudi Arabia
Alter your cranium
I'm gonna bang on 'em, I'm gonna bang on 'em
I'm gonna bang on 'em, I'm gonna bang on 'em (aye)
You want no smoke when I propane flow
AK scope, I'm coming for your throat
Off-White cord on a Hi-C boat
Know I'm finna drip like a lion in the cold
Ride in my lane, y'all losing your life
Killing y'all lames with a Goyard knife
What y'all trying, I did that twice
Vegas boy, I throw them dice

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Okay, bitch, I'm getting sweaty, huh
'Cause I'm getting heavy, uh
'Cause I'm eating good (yuh, yuh)
I got a plate of steak and spaghetti, uh (sauce)
Ain't no nigga run my cul-de-sac like E-Ed, Edd n Eddy, uh (aye)
Black bitch don't give Becky, uh (aye)
Jason versus Freddy
Okay, bitch, I'm getting sweaty, huh
'Cause I'm getting heavy, uh
'Cause I'm eating good
I got a plate of steak and spaghetti, uh
Ain't no nigga run my cul-de-sac like E-Ed, Edd n Eddy, uh
