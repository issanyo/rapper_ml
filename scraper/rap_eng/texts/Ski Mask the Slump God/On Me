[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
[?] (did you know I brought water?)
Little bit late (did you know I brought, what?)
Your bitch still a whore, aye (aye, like what)
Yuh, like water this (it's a damn prank)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
Your bitch see my dick and she help it
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
I really can't, share a xan
I'm like, "On me!"
Diamonds on me, bitches on me, saucy, on me!
Diamonds on me, bitches on me, saucy
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
Your bitch see my dick and she help it
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
I really can't, on me!
Diamonds on me, bitches on me
You know your bitch, on me!
Your bitch see my dick and you say, what? It is on me!

[Verse: Flyboy Tarantino]
Adderall flow, focus
Gotta keep the fans close, the enemies closest
My nigga got the antidote, he took a mean dosage
All the dough, money like the water, let it flow bitch
You know I'm from the 954, [?]
[?]
Any nigga try my clique, can't touch my money, can't touch my bitch
Focus, took a adderall, I'm hittin' licks
Call up J Mob, he gon' take it to the six, that's it
Cash, guap, moola, on me!
IPhone airplane mode 'cause she blowin' up my phone
I can tell that she want me

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Know you best friends if you share a xan (bitch, you know you best friends)
Bitch, you know you best friends if you share a xan

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm like, "On me!"
Diamonds on me, bitches on me, saucy, on me!
Diamonds on me, bitches on me, saucy
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
Your bitch see my dick and she help it
I really can't help it, I really can't help it
I really can't, on me!
Diamonds on me, bitches on me
You know your bitch, on me!
Your bitch see my dick and you say, what? It is on me!
