[Verse]
My diamonds are so big just like a Pitbull
You sensitive like a nipple
Just like Elmo make me giggle
Because…

[Verse]
Diamonds on loop-de-loop
So big it look like a hula hoop
They tryna lock me in pigeon coop
Even if so I would chop the roof
Slick like I'm Rick
Slick like a fork after used to eating ramen noodle soup
I'm on a hunt like Attila the Hun or it’s winter way
Hungry for caribou
Tryna bag me a bad and boujee barbie boo
That be flipping like nickel when I rendezvous
How I recycle money it's like déjà vu
This not Snakes on a Plane, this is Gucci on my suit
Like Whoops, I just spilled sauce like oops
Weed smoke it smell like a poop
I just spilled sauce like oops, oops, oops
(ahahahaha)
