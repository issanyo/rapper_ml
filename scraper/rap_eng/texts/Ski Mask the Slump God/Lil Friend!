[Intro: RyBundy & Ski Mask The Slump God]

Hi my names Ryan, Aye! You might wanna turn this the fuck up
Slap this shit on your mother fucking 808's

[Chours: Ski Mask The Slump God]

I might just smoke a nigga in a chopper
Hit 'em with the pencil and the lead
I might just smoke a nigga in a chopper
Hit 'em with the pencil and the lead
No this ain't no Zeppelin, hit a mother fucker with the lead
No this ain't no Zeppelin but hit a mother fucker with the lead
Okay like, get in the chopper get in the chopper, hit 'em with the lead, get in the chopper, get in the chopper, hit 'em with the lead,
get in the chopper, get in the chopper, on my lead!

[Verse 1: DirtyFaceSmook]

Greasy ass wrist went into the shop
I stomp a nigga out, it's some dirty litter box
Bitch I'm high as God, see me on the tree top
Y'all got hundred shot TEC if a nigga means not
First rap check, bought a whole team yachts
And the first nigga that try us, gonna be swimming like a Pisces
I've been rolling with the villains, I've been fooling with the goblins
I've been rolling with the robbers, getting sucked up I'm Adonis
In the Porsche trying to call dollar, on the way to make a move
I can't lose, I'm a fool, 'cause I ride round with that tool
I take your bitch, then I left her starstruck bitch,
Fuck the drive-by, I do workups,
You niggas lame, you sweet as pie
My niggas is niggas who really them niggas
Who's talking them pistols and letting them fly,
Smoke him dead in his eyes
Try Dirty Face nigga you finna die

[Chours: Ski Mask The Slump God]

I might just smoke a nigga in a chopper
Hit 'em with the pencil and the lead
I might just smoke a nigga in a chopper
Hit 'em with the pencil and the lead
No this ain't no Zeppelin, hit a mother fucker with the lead
No this ain't no Zeppelin but hit a mother fucker with the lead
Okay like, get in the chopper get in the chopper, hit 'em with the lead, get in the chopper, get in the chopper, hit 'em with the lead,
get in the chopper, get in the chopper, on my lead!
