[Intro]
Ski, Ski
Bitch!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
If I go broke then I'ma bool with my tool (With my tool)
You pull your shit, I pull my shit and let them duel (We let them duel)
This ain't no dream bitch, this ain't no planet drool (Ski, Ski)
Don't be a fool, just let me bool
If I go broke then I'ma bool with my tool (With my tool)
This ain't no Beyblade, but bitch we gonna let them duel (Pow-pow)
This ain't no dream bitch, this ain't no planet drool
Don't be a fool, just let me bool

[Verse 1: The Slump God]
Bitch!
5 hour bitch I need energy
To beat the pussy make melodies
I am the shit, know you smelling me
Don't fuck with John, fuck with Kennedy's
I want a Sub-Zero wrist
Put some ice up on that bitch
Chef Boyardee in the kitchen, beat the pot up with my fist
You, you can't test us
High as giraffe nuts
Slow like molasses
I reside in the body of a bastard
Niggas try me then I Megaman blast them
Make or break that bitch
I look upon my wrist, and like a disc
That bitch is dancing, shine
Lizard lick a bitch, that mean I rob her, whip her
Like the movie Taken this bitch mine

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Roll away, the summer time don't await for me
If I ever break, them fuck them
Bitch, fuck the state
Then baby sit down, sit down
