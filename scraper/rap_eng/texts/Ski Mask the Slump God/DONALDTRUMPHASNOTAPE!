[Intro]
Ayy, ayyy, ayyyy! Yuh
I'm with Cortex, hey
I'm with Smokeasac, hm
Hey, okay like
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ayy, lets get it crackin' bitch
Ayy, ayy, how much you rackin' bitch?
This is really happenin'
Like a black bitch speaking Latin
Ayy! Yuh, yuh

[Verse 1]
She suck the soul out me, holy water what she taste, hm
Like Bobby Flay, I left the kitchen, stove by my waist, hm
Dylann Roof, I might shoot your grandmas place, hm
How can I trust a president without a tape?

[Chorus]
Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump
Need to fight his barber cause his hair like what the fuck
Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump
Need to fight his barber cause his hair like what the fuck

[Verse 2]
Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it
Ay, ayy, ay ayyyy
(?) motherfuckin' missed it
Yeah, that, that, that
Ayy ayyyy
Strum her pussy, guitar, rockstar, hm
She want my dick hard, cockstar, hm
Walk up in the club (?) Wockhardt, ayyy
Fred Flinstone leopard leotard, hm
Cause the sauce stay connected to my hipbone
Rick Owens stay connected to my big toe
Fat Nick stay connected to a rib bone
And my face stay broken like a wishbone, bitch
Aye, cougar in vancouver dressed up like the cheetah girls
Loot up in my pocket, she said "Origami World"
Take that bitch shopping, talkin' wally, wally, world
Feel like Lil Durk, need that molly, molly, girl
We jus' like a picture ?
*Inhales* *ugghh* hit that dope and then I hurl
Pussy be nuttin', cry like an onion, wet like Jheri curl
Wait 'til it hurt, wrist how I'm working, sweat on my shirt like I'm earl

[Chorus]
Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump
Need to fight his barber cause his hair like what the fuck
Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Donald Trump
Need to fight his barber cause his hair like what the fuck
