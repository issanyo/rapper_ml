[Intro]
Na-Na-Na-Na-Nationwide on yo' bitch side! Ayy!
Ayy ayy! Huh, huh
Whatever I say, y'all gotta do
Simon says do, your hoe do
My bitch look like Kim Possible
Shout-out my mucus!
My bitch look like Kim Possible
No Nickelodeon hoe
No slime! No slime part two
My sli-sli-sli-sli-sli-slime, ayy!

[Verse 1]
Shapeshift, what you do, I'm you, uh-huh
Turn into a hoe, no voodoo
Pull up on her, give her my P like I'm Diddy
I'm puttin', I'm puttin' her legs up like a wheelie
Know couple niggas that done fell off
Might go on Facebook and give your mom a poke
Like the ozone layer, you don't want smoke
Like I'm Gary the Snail, your bitch I slow stroke

[Chorus]
I'm on your bitch side like Nationwide, on me (like what?)
It's some weed (like what?), and it's lots on me (like what?)
Your bitch is to the side, I'm chicken, she fries, on me (ayy)
It's some weed, and it's lots on me, umm
I’m on your bitch side like Nationwide, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me (water)
Your bitch is to the side, I'm chicken, she fries, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me, umm

[Verse 2]
Okay, like poison ivy, nobody is fuckin' with me (mhm)
My flow is float like butterfly, sting like bee (mhm)
I got one goddamn question, can I proceed?
Yuh, yuh yuh yuh yuh, yes, indeed (yuh, yuh, yuh)
Off the gelato, revvin' the throttle, mhm
I’m at the top like the next model, mhm
Spanish bitch fuckin' me, that my vata, mhm
Mhm, mhm, mhm
Like guys, like five, though, when I ride, though
'Cause they want the beef no chicken, lettuce, or fries, though
Dick like horn on top of rhino
Two different colored bitches with me, tie-dye though
Niggas be always boring with sauce like ouch though
Catch Me Outside be buzzin' like I'm a fly though
Diamonds be wet like on a teary eye though
American idol, jello psycho

[Chorus]
I'm on your bitch side like Nationwide, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me, umm (water)
Your bitch is to the side, I'm chicken, she fries, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me, umm
I'm on your bitch side like Nationwide, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me (water)
Your bitch is to the side, I'm chicken, she fries, on me
It's some weed, and it's lots on me, umm
