[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Lanlord Collectin]
L-L-Lanlord in the building!
Hey, hey, hey
You know I got my blanket because it's like four in the morning and I'm tryna finish this shit for you guys
(Oops, I meant to say my blanket, and I'm sorry if I spilled sauce on you, yeah)
Where the soccer moms?

[Chorus]
Pioneer sauce, old school clean
Couple cougars said they lovin' it, no Mickey D's
Tell them "Crisscross, applesauce" beef
Danny make it wetter than a Rick Ross beat
Pioneer sauce, old school clean
Couple cougars said they lovin' it, no Mickey D's
Tell them "Crisscross, applesauce" me
Danny make it wetter than a Rick Ross beat

[Verse]
Porcupine, huh (yuh), can't touch me
Step aside, Old Spice; you musty (step aside)
Getcha clips cause my handle is a fleeting
So if you try me, take this L and call your meeting
I'm Dr. Evil, pinkie up, I'm blunting on 'em (pinkies up!)
Spirit animal and acid dropping on 'em (shit, shit)
I'm in a Gucci store, like 12, I'm copping on 'em (cop that shit)
Minivan, an older top dropping on 'em (hey, hey)
Never got me out, I run my motherfuckin' mouth, huh
And I must assume that's why you sour like a kraut, huh
Can't resist, I get too strong, that bitch be workin' out, huh
But I throw this 'Preme on me, it's wet just like a mouth, huh

[Chorus]
Pioneer sauce, old school clean
Couple cougars said they lovin'  it, no Mickey D's
Tell them "Crisscross, applesauce" beef
Danny make it wetter than a Rick Ross beat
Pioneer sauce, old school clean
Couple cougars said they lovin' it, no Mickey D's
Tell them "Crisscross, applesauce" me
Danny make it wetter than a Rick Ross beat

[Outro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Lanlord Collectin]
Huh, slaps for the drop top
L-L-Lanlord in the building!
