[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
A1, bitch pussy A1
Nothin' like the sauce, â€˜cause the bitch pussy Cajun
Like I'm Daniel San
Hit the block, waxin' on wax off, wax on feelin'
Like I'm Randy Mon
And my money long, I'm flexin'
You sweet, pussy nigga, big Texas
Like I'm Roosevelt, presidential belt
Like a pep boy chain clang cut sale
Ski be so lowkey with all the trees in this bitch
Did it like Simon Says, make 'em freeze in this bitch
Uno said money taught me to speak in this bitch
I'm off a half like I got a leak in this bitch
(Wooh) look at that, blowing up, C4, uh
On the low, hit a lick, Debo, uh
Pacquiao pack from my 'migo
Run around the lobby like Regal

[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
Ay, ay, my bitch, she look like Kate Moss
I gotta get this shake off, ay
And with these diamonds, watch me floss
Ay, how much the whips cost?
Yeah
My bitch, she look like Kate Moss
I'm tryna get this shake off, ay
And with this money I'm a boss
Yeah, how much them whips cost?

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God]

Kate Moss, Kate Moss, Kate Moss, hit it
Kate Moss, Kate Moss, Kate Moss, walk it up
Kate Moss, uh, yeah, hit it

[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
My bitch, she look like Kate Moss
I gotta get this shake off, woah, woah
My bitch she look like Kate Moss, yeah, yeah
I gotta get this shake off like
