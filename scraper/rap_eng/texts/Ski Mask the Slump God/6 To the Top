Shout out to Will thats my manager
I got my brain from a bakery
Cause i got bread on my mind
That money you can't take away from me
Imma go fuck on yo moms cause she whippin in the BM dub skrt off
No face no case
Let us be free
Judge had no choice but to drop  a nigga charge
Now i know that nigga scared
Tell that boy we want his head
Pussy niggas wanna open they mouth
Conversations with the feds
This that trap shit
Turn the cash shit
Cause when the boy cashin out to the bank im laughing
Told yo bitch to throw it back i got the Magnum
Bitch i got the .45 on my hip im blastin
Niggas act like Goofy so you know im Maxin
Savage got his jacket posted with the ratchet
Please tell me why you [?] on this nigga
Imma have to get mine
When i nut its supposed to hit you
This MK on my wrist, 14 karat pretty picture
4 in my double cup im not much of a sipper, aye
