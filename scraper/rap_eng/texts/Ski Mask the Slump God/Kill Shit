[Intro: iLL Chris]
Ayy, 808 Mafia
Illy, illy, huh

[Chorus: iLL Chris]
Goin' ape shit, purple grape shit
Always stay lit, I'ma kill shit
Boy, I'ma kill shit
Blood on my camo, red on my camo
Yellow my camo
Blood on my camo, red on my camo
It's all in my camo

[Verse 1: iLL Chris]
Runnin' with apes, stuntin' with apes, we gunnin' with apes
We stuntin' in Bape, stay out of my lane, we up in the game
Brand new shit, I'm up with the game, just doin' my thing
You know I'ma flex, what's up wit' yo bitch? She pogo my dick
Let me take a break, let me snap a bit
Know I'm like a boss to this fashion shit
Know I'm like a god to this fashion shit
Know I'm like a beast to this rappin' shit
Know I got swag in the house for real
Really wanna know, I'm from the south for real
Grew up on the east side, beast side, LV
Snipe you mothafuckas right out ya field (bang)

[Chorus: iLL Chris & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Goin' ape shit, purple grape shit (ayy)

Blood on my camo, red on my camo (huh)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Gym socks in my Sprite, bitch I'm sippin' dirty, huh
Bathin' Ape was on me while yo' nigga lookin' dirty, huh
Thi-think I saw a pussycat, but Ski is not no birdie (21, ayy)
Yo' bitch gon' squat on my dick, but a real nigga call it curtsy (huh)
I took a deuce, up on the track (shit)
Cooter same color, as all that Bape (huh, mm)
I put my top, right in the trash (huh, huh, huh)
Felt like a fanny, smell like an ass (spin!)
Look at yo' money, all green like grass (what, huh, yuh)
Look at my money, all blue like rack (racks, yuh)
I put a dot, red on that back
Look at that back, I need it back, yuh
Goyard, 'Preme on my back
[?] like back, bitch
Poppin' at a nigga like Tec
Know I want them Ed, Edd n' Eddy durags, bitch
If your bitch lookin' up at me, means she think I'm kinda sexy
Blowin' up my phone like sex, bitch (ayy, ayy ayy, ayy, ayy!)
Pull up on a bitch like sex, if
Hol' up, money in the bag, bitch

[Bridge: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Bathin' Ape on my body
So a nigga gotta shout-out Harambe (shout him out)

[Verse 3: Robb Bank$]
I just fucked 43 fast (yuh!)
While she cut it down with the Ac (Ac)
I just took your bitch out these niggas (yeah)
Spent a dough, crazy, called it "set" (set)
Sucked my dick, looked up, seen a demon (ayy, ooh)
She better pray I don't hit it from the back (back)
She started out raw, I hear she said pause (sure, sure, pau-)
I sent her back she gave you clap (ooh)
Fuck nigga know he a crook (crook)
Lil' bitch know she a gnat (lil' gnat)
Talk to me if you got Ac (Ac)
Don't talk to me if you ain't strapped (you ain't strapped)
Walk around town with a mat (blah, blah)
Broward County put it on the map (blah!)
Fuck yo' main bih' from the back (back)
Slap her on the booty better fuck on that Tec
Hol' up, I'm a beast, fuck on the sheets (beast, beast, sheets, shee-)
She sat on my dick, I'm in the deep (yuh-yuh, yuh-yuh)
