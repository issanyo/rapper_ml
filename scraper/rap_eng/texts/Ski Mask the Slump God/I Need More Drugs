[Intro]
To Bass be the glory

[Verse 1: Bass Santana]
Look, I done fucked around and turned your daughter to a eater, yeah
If my baby cheating on me, I don't really need her, yeah
Ugly motherfucker got the pretty hoes dreaming, yeah
I can't help myself, no, I was always out here scheming, yeah
Bass God, Bass God, Bass God, Bass, yeah
I could wash my pain away with drugs to the face
I could front your ass at least a dub if he's straight
I won't make deliveries unless it's an eighth
On my dick, on my dick, I'm a mean ass nigga
You don't rap, you ain't real, you a green ass nigga
I got pack, I got pack, I got loud, loud, loud
I don't trap, bitch I juug
It go down, down, down
Hold up
Eat the pussy, leave her ass behind like yesterday
I got the track, we could text today
Pull out the pack and I flex a J, Lord knows, knows
I don't fuck with you, it ain't no need to speculate
I bring his bitch into the base
I got that voodoo for you, baby
I got the shooters going crazy
I let them do the illustration
I'm in the mood, I'm hella faded
You're my pursuit like Will and Jaden
I must remove the text you gave me
You know my main investigating
I got the acid, I'm amazing
I gotta laugh when I'm sedated
Hold on, I'm on point, I'm on point, pull up
Hopping through the county, I've been tryna make a move up
Never been a sober motherfucker, hallelujah
I'm the one that showed a motherfucker how to do it
Run up on a other nigga, ever been a gutter nigga
Caught him with the cutter, had to cut a nigga up bih
Who got the funk? Who got the pack?
Just hit me up, I'll hit you back

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Young nigga, young nigga, young lit nigga
No shit, I was with your bitch, she was lit, nigga
No flex, they the ones who slept on some real niggas
Hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like, hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like young nigga, young nigga, young lit nigga
Hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like

[Verse 2: $ki Mask The Slump God]
Dolemite, dynamite, galactic your ass tonight
Acid trip manager, I spy a K tonight
Jugular, jugular, slice it with pocket knife
I want your mother now, cougar my dick tonight
I been charged up like some Powerade, Broward made
Throwin' shade at you like a bucket hat, mmm
Minute Maid, OJ, light aid, risk worth
Niggas hatin' on me, what the fuck is that? Mm
Yo' bitch confuse you like riddle, mm
You niggas sticky like maple, mmm
.40 tug tight like a cradle, mm
Fantasy, I'm yo' bitch faithful, mm
She suck like vampire, I stake her, mmm
Build-A-Bear Workshop, I take her, mm
Beat the pussy like I hate her, mm
She sniff that white but no Quaker, mmm
Take him, meet his maker, As-Salaam-Alaikum
I just want the paper quick like a pussy
Fall in like a laker, big dick like an acre
I need more drugs in the pot, bitch I'm cooking
Dancing with the Stars, my diamonds shining
And it couldn't be a better timing, mm
Nigga call your barber, your line is frowning
Fade away, fade away the climate, ew

[Chorus: Bass Santana]
Young nigga, young nigga, young lit nigga
No shit, I was with your bitch, she was lit, nigga
No flex, they the ones who slept on some real niggas
Hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like, hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like young nigga, young nigga, young lit nigga
Hit me on my motherfucking line, I could serve you up
Like...
