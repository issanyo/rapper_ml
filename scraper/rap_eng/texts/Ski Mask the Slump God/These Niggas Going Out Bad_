Lyrics From Snippet

[Chorus: Yung Bans & Ski Mask The Slump God]
These niggas going out bad, these niggas going out sad (ayy)
Young nigga blowin' a bag (bag), why the fuck they call me Yung Bans?
Bad, these niggas going out bad (ayy), these niggas going out sad
[?], I got jet lag, no edible, I'm in this Jag, yeah
These niggas going out bad, these niggas going out sad (ayy)
Young nigga blowin' a bag (bag), why the fuck they call me Yung Bans?
Bad, these niggas going out bad (ayy), these niggas going out sad
[?], I got jet lag, no edible, I'm in this Jag, yeah

[Verse 1: Yung Bans & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yeah, these bitches can't get no pack, huh, bust a nut on her ass, uh
Watch me shake it off my ass, me, my money and cash
Clean her just like bags, like grass I'm on they ass
[?], no tags, stack it up to the ceilin', no fan
Bitch, I need a bankroll, hit her up, case closed
Bad bitch, pretty toes, she gon' drink the whole load
Woah, she gon' drink the whole damn load, slime on me, gon' wipe your nose, huh
Iced out, diamonds on froze, I don't want the pussy, I'ma fuck your nose
Niggas be lookin' sad, fuck on that bih, hit it from the back
Stalk on that [?], you should've known that bih wasn't that
Lots of big clothes, my cash can't fold
[?], feel like 2Pac, got a ring in my nose

[Chorus: Yung Bans & Ski Mask The Slump God]
These niggas going out bad, these niggas going out sad (ayy)
Young nigga blowin' a bag (bag), why the fuck they call me Yung Bans?
Bad, these niggas going out bad (ayy), these niggas going out sad
[?], I got jet lag, no edible, I'm in this Jag, yeah
These niggas going out bad, these niggas going out sad (ayy)
Young nigga blowin' a bag (bag), why the fuck they call me Yung Bans?
Bad, these niggas going out bad (ayy), these niggas going out sad
[?], I got jet lag, no edible, I'm in this Jag, yeah
