[Intro: Ryan Santan & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hi, my name's Ryan (pew)
You might wanna turn this the fuck up (pew)
Slap this shit on your motherfuckin' 808s (or them titties, bitch)
Or them titties (*laugh*)
Motherfuckin' flexin' on these bitch-ass niggas (yuh)
Who, hey, who, hey, who (ayy)
Oops, what I spilled? (*laugh*)
Bitch, wet, wet, wet, wet

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & Pollàri]
Feel like Mr. T, a nigga 'bout to T up, umm
Bitch can't fuck up my re-up, umm
Out in the Cabana with my feet up, umm
Wrist on Carter, FIBA, no diva, ayy
Move that work, Magneto, ayy
My plug look like Carlito, ayy
Best in the booth on the East Coast, huh
Got my chest feelin' like CeeLo Green
Lean, mean, making-money machine
Off the coke keys, I be sleep off the lean
Donkey Kong the pussy, hit it like Bling
At the gates of hell, I still got on 'Preme
Oops, what I spilled? Sauce, ayy
What I want? Porsche, ayy
Runnin' man, uh, gone, ayy
Throwin' money, Randy Moss
I'm smokin' on cannabis, feelin' like Hannibal
Handle your fade and I damage it, umm
Puncture my enemies, I'm the best candidate
Drip for the cash and I ran with it, umm
Palace on my body, I'm the man, umm
Tatt on my body, Juwanna Mann, umm
Fuck with that drama spray, llama man, umm (llàri)
Total, the drama, no island-man, hey (llàri, llàri, *laugh*)

[Verse 2: Pollàri]

Slump moves that shit by the Ki, yuh (*cackle*)
All of these hoes, they on me, yuh (*cackle*)
93 Octane, my seat, yuh (llàri, llàri)
I got some gold on my teeth, yuh (my teeth, yuh)
I got some gold on my rings, yuh (my rings, llàri)
I got your ho in my sheets, yuh (yah)
Fuck that lil bitch for a week, yuh (yah)
All of these bitches, they need me, yuh (*cackle*)
I move that water like Fiji, yuh (*cackle*)
All of these niggas, they hatin' like Bynum (yah)
