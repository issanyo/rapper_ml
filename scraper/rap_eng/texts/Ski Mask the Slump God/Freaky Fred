[Intro]
To bass be the glory
Ayy, ayy, yuh, wet, splash

[Verse 1]
Hatin' on a nigga like your name George Bush
This that new shit like I'm a tourist
Don't leave the kitchen till' I got a torn wrist
Papa Bear in that pussy and I need some porridge
Ricky Bobby on my body and I got endorsements
Put my dick in a witch, say rigor mortis
Put a tat on my face and she call me gorgeous
I done ran up the money, fuck a portion

[Chorus]
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
I spilt some lean in my Fanta
I don't rock no mo' bandannas, no
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
There is dead guys in my wallet
Supreme just threw up in my closet

[Verse 2]
She ride on my dick like a biker, climb on my dick like a hiker
Your bitch is very excited, she wanna do it no Nike
I rock the ski but no ski mask, I rock the mask from the hockey
I showed a trick to your wee-man, we disappear won't say sorry
Wipe me down, no ShamWow
Speaking with the pistol, shit say grrr-ow
J.G. Wentworth need my money now
How I walk up bout the bank bands heavy like ow
Only tip a nigga if he mean just like a cow
Snub-nosed pistol make a nigga say ow
Finger on trigger make em' kiss like now
Bitch I'm Freaky Fred with the flame like bow

[Chorus]
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
I spilt some lean in my Fanta
I don't rock no mo' bandannas, no
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
There is dead guys in my wallet
Supreme just threw up in my closet

[Outro]
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
Houston, we might have a problem
I don't rock no mo' bandannas
I spilt some lean in my Fanta
Your bitch make me so excited
I might just hit it, one night it
