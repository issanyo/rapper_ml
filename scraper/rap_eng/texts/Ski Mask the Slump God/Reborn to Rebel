[Intro]
Ayy (Haha)
N-O
Hell no (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, uh (Ayy)

[Pre-Chorus]
I met the devil, my soul I'm not sellin', but hello
Run Armageddon, your soul are you sellin'? N-O
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo
Let's start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out

[Chorus]
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
I don't care if you don't care, we don't
Life ain't fair, we ain't scared, we know
I don't care if you don't care, we don’t

[Verse 1]
And for us to survive, we need to uprise our people (Yup)
Must sanitize the thought of demise of freedom (Yup)
Like Allstate, you're in good hands with me though
Taking our children, they got us searchin' like for Nemo (Yuh)
I won't take no shit from the government (Ah, woah)
They been had plans for this, wasn't suddenly (Ah, woah)
And any time I can, I take the system's hand and crumble it
Whenever you can make a difference, yell it out, don't mumble it
I distract myself from the world to stay in my element
The heart I carry takes on the weight of good people's negligence
So if the government don't give a shit, you can't stay mad again
'Cause we already feel the same way about how they handle shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, I met the devil, my soul I'm not sellin', but hello (Hello)
Run Armageddon, your soul are you sellin'? N-O (N-O)
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo (Elmo)
Let’s start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out
(Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)

[Chorus]
I don't care if you don't care, we don't (Grrr)
I don't care if you don’t care, we don't (Grrr)
Life ain't fair, we ain’t scared, we know
I don't care if you don’t care, we don't

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is a new pea coat, and I paid my taxes
I Carmelo at the free throw, on they ass like grass
I may seem flyer than a seagull, Harry Potter glasses
Cleanin' Stanley Steamer steam hoe, call me Ski, no snow slope
Humanity sucks, humanity blows, no cello
No hablo Español, but dinero
Drop my top, JFK, leggo
They wanna link and try to build, Legos
Hold on to something, I am eruptin'
It’s a destruction, sons of the anarchy
Bust up teeth for my lunch, bitch, with no discussion
This is disgustin', fake it to make it you-

[Pre-Chorus]
I met the devil, my soul I'm not sellin', but hello (Hello)
Run Armageddon, your soul are you sellin'? N-O (N-O)
Snorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo (Elmo)
Let’s start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out

[Chorus]
I don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t
I don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t
Life ain’t fair, we ain’t scared, we know
I don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t (We don't)
