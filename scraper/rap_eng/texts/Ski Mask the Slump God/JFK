[Intro]
It ain't really shit too
And when it busts to the head nigga
Boot up, voot up
MeltFaze productions
Thirty with the dick
Woke up like, "where the fuck the dope at?"
Know we fuckin' lit, yuh
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, yuh!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, yuh! Bitch, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Lil Boofy got the .22, let it do-do-do
And I'm with the blade like I'm Puss n Boots 2 (Ayy)
Louis straitjacket, I'm a fuckin' loose screw (Look at my jacket)
Had to rob the pesos off my nigga Jesus
Cocaine coat like a fresh [?]
Shawty need some milk gave that bitch a Yoohoo
Psychedelic mushroom ring I do (Yuh, Yuh)
And I'm running with the Ray Gun, pew-pew-pew
Like dip, dip, dip, dip (Come here), dip, dip, dip that motherfucker
From the hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hip, hip pussy boy
Bitch on whoa, bitch on go
And that ass built like some Cadillac doors
Probably on 6s, probably on 4s, Flyboy done came through
And me and [?] stun those
Like look at my bezel it's shiny, mm
She like the way that I'm rhyming, mm
Look at them titties I'm signing, mm
These niggas stealing my styling, mm
I last forever like diamond, mm
She get me hard as a diamond, mm
My wrist whip while it's reclining, mm
Gold on me like I was mining, ayy

[Chorus]
Drop my top, JFK, yo bitch pussy on my plate
All my jewelry, like McFlurry, or a fucking Zebra Cake
Drop my top, JFK, yo bitch pussy on my plate
All my jewelry, like McFlurry, or a fucking Zebra Cake

[Verse 2]
All of your diamonds look dirty, mm
All of my jewelry look scurry, ayy
My diamonds came with a story, hm
Once 'pon a time they was buried, hm
Dog in that pussy I Courage, ayy
Now she talking 'bout a marriage?
Might come with a blur
My diamonds came in like skrrt, okay

[Chorus]
Drop my top, JFK, yo bitch pussy on my plate
All my jewelry, like McFlurry, or a fucking zebra, ayy
Drop my top, JFK, yo bitch pussy on my plate
All my jewelry, like McFlurry, like a fucking zebra, ayy


[Outro]
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Ooh she mad, bitch need milk
Like voot up, voot up, voot up, yuh!
