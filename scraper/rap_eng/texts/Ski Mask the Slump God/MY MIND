[Intro]
Natra
Yuh, fuck out my mind, bottle, ayy
Six on me, six, ayy, gold on me, hey
Bottle

[Chorus]
I can't control, this mind of mine
Yet I climb, and I get high
I can't control, this mind of mine
Yet I climb, and I get high

[Verse]
Ayy, ayy, I tell 'em one hunnid, 'cause I'm one hunnid
And her nigga runnin', when I'm in her tummy
Ayy-ayy, these niggas so ass, I bought them a seat cushion
Niggas so sad, tryna be the shit like poopy pushin'
Said these niggas cats, like they Chinese food
They don't want beef, likin' Tofu
Got my balls in the right spot, like in beer pong
I'm not Nate Dogg, but got a old soul, huh
Uh, so tell them niggas three hunna, 'cause my age is three hunna
Roman Gucci toga, cost me 'bout six baby strollers
Ayy, she wanna tell me somethin' special
Just like she a fortune cookie, or wet like loogie
When she be droppin' that neck
I just humina, humina, humina, okay, ayy
Just like I was a lil' flower seed
You was a Sun to me, I take your energy
Drop-top like Kennedy, heard what I said to these-
Speak with them bees, like I'm spendin' on Louie tees

[Chorus]
I can't control, this mind of mine
Yet I climb, and I get high (it's a mothafuckin' celebration)
I can't control, this mind of mine (you can't stop me, wooh!)
Yet I climb, while I get high
