[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I done woke up on the block, block, block, block, block, block
Block boys, block boys, block boys, huh
I done woke up on the block, block, block, block, block, block
Block boys, block boys, block boys, what

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Okay, wassup block boy, turn the Glock, boy
I know you's a opp, boy, run to the cops, boy
Hol up, [?], she sound like [?]
Weight on my flow sound like [?]
Sharp like a sword, strong like a fort
Then I had to put the lean in Fanta, of course
Block, block, block, block, block, block, block
Just jumped the block, no hopscotch
[?] of the fox

[Verse 2: ILL Chris]
Chopping the block, chopping the block
Karate the block, chopping the block
Popping the Glock, Illy the god
[?] the pot, [?]
Chillin in spots, grilling the opps
[?], illy will pop
Milly I rock, in cities I pop
Slicker than fox, I'm jugging it off
Pass em like a [?], cross them like a hashtag
Moving that pack in a ninja turtle backpack
[?]
Ride back quick, man it's hot like [?]

[Hook: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Woke up on block, block, block, block, block, block
Block boys, block boys, block boys, huh
I done woke up on the block, block, block, block, block, block
Block boys, block boys, block boys, what
