Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy let me hear that ho Jeff
Uh, yup, damn Jeff
Uh, ha-ha, hi-ya, yeah!
Bitch, wa-wa-wa-wa-water!
Aha, let's get it
Yuh, you ready?

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God & Danny Towers]
Uh, grounded sharp no cleat
I'm grounded, like some beef
Hit the street, had to pull out my meat
Not the penis, but the dick on 13
Got me shitting on these niggas, TP
Bitch, crawlin' in it, bitch creepy (creepy)
Mississippi pussy, swamp meet
Down by the river
She gon' eat, eat, I'm an owl!

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ah, who? who? who? who? He!
Who? I don't know the nigga
Who? He don't know me!
Pull up with some OG stank ew (feet)
Bitch I am an owl, I'm like who? Who? He!
Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? He!
I don't know the nigga (ew)
He don't know me!
Pull up with some OG stank (feet)
Feeling like a rubber ducky, squeaky clean!

[Verse 2: Danny towers]

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Who? who? who? who? He!
Who? I don't know the nigga
Who? He don't know me!
Pull up with some OG stank ew (feet)
Bitch I am an owl, I'm like who? Who? He!
Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? He!
I don't know the nigga (ew)
He don't know me!
Pull up with some OG stank (feet)
Feeling like a rubber ducky, squeaky clean!
