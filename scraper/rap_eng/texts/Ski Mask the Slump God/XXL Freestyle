[Verse]
You and yo'
You and yo'
You and yo' bitch kinda resemble Billy and Mandy
My bitch like Sandy
'Cause of the cheeks
Rode on my dick and said it was so dandy
Yippee ki-yay
I heard Freddy don't fuck with the feds
Yellow bitches on me like Lemon Head
Run up my sack like Ed and Edd, 'n' Eddy
Red and black sweater like my name is Freddy
Color spaghetti
I so messy
Peacoat khaki, never lackin'
Keep that thirty in my jacket
Look at the diamonds, they on hush mode, uh
'Cause I buy diamonds for they ex-hoe, uh
They be so clear and so see-through, uh
Like a nigga lookin' through the peephole, uh
I just send 'em "XD rawr"
When I be textin' yo' whore
Look at candy paint on car
It's brown like the Noah's Ark
Hit a stain like Mr. Clean
Then put a nigga on game like Atari
Know how a nigga rockin' like guitar
What I'm smokin' smellin' like, a fart
Like Hercules, strong on these bitches they back on knees
Back in that bih' like "what's happening?"
Jump in that pussy like trampoline
Made that pussy sound like mac' 'n' cheese
When I'm hittin' I'm just practicing
They be like "Ski, you be snappening!
Teach me the ways of the saucin' king," hah
