[Verse 4: $ki Mask]
Woke up with a head then slap on a rack

She said she can't breathe
She still goin' hard asthma attack
Respect my mind and respecting my gat
Supreme on my back
Five panel hat

So pass that shit back
Them Juicy J paper, get trippy off that
I puff and I pass
I'm bustin' right through
You catchin' a chill
Ice on my neck
Gotta throw up your set
That's when them watches, the chains, the rings
Be shinin' the best
I'm whippin' and cooking and looking the best
Stainless steel from Bangladesh
She squirt like a hoe who been touching herself
Mind on that green like I'm layin' in grass
Colored Sprite
Got me nice
Damn I'm lookin' swag tonight

Teeth pearly white
She tryna fuck tonight
Rollin up that grand daddy
Now my head feel Einstein
Sittin' back
Pushin' packs
Mary Jane my concubine
