[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Haha, ayy, water!
Ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy
Ayy ayy ayy, ayy ayy
Huh, ayy, I'm like, uh
Lil BabyWipe, huh
Lil BabyWipe, huh
Hey, hey, Lil BabyWipe
Huh, hey, what?
Okay!

[Chorus: Mike]
I got me some money, need a Wraith
Foreign bitch, I'm tryna fuck her face
Been trappin' all day, you need to wait
Just looked at my wrist, it's time to skate
I got me some money, need a Wraith
Foreign bitch, I'm tryna fuck her face
Been trappin' all day, you need to wait
Just looked at my wrist, it's time to skate

[Verse 1: Rich2Litt]
A lot of niggas talkin', where the money at?
The only money that you touchin' that emoji bag
Only bitches that you fuck used to be a man
All you out here doin' clown shit just for the trends
Shit is so crazy how I see it
I told you I be on, but y'all niggas ain't believe it
Ya niggas lookin' hurt like y'all niggas got defeated
I'm really with the shits, yeah I'm really in these streets
The only time you touching quarters, nigga in the Laundromat
Want my fuckin' money dummy, you can have your daughter back
Used to be broke but I really changed all of that
Packs about to touchdown like a fuckin' running back
Niggas used to laugh but now I guess I'm laughin' back
Only fuck a shorty definitely because her ass is fat
Only fuck a shorty definitely to let my dick attack
Only fuck a shorty then I curve her, guess I'm missin' that
Niggas hate my 'cause they ain't me
All these bitches screaming spank me
When I pull up swinging bats
Yeah, you could call me Yankee
Feelin' like I'm Derek Jeter
I might let my dick just beat her
Told her from the jump lil shorty I dont fuckin need ya
Yeah I got my money up
All these bitches tryna fuck
Took a lotta Ls but I'm over that, now I'm throwing
Work out like a fuckin' quarterback
Sucked my dick then I told her "lil bitch, just throw it back"

[Chorus: Mike]
I got me some money, need a Wraith
Foreign bitch, I'm tryna fuck her face
Been trappin' all day, you need to wait
Just looked at my wrist, it's time to skate
I got me some money, need a Wraith
Foreign bitch, I'm tryna fuck her face
Been trappin' all day, you need to wait
Just looked at my wrist, it's time to skate

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Like jnkies! Huh, yuh
I don't think that you see clearly, huh, yuh
She gon' suck me like binky, huh, yuh
And my dick long like Lincoln, huh
Like slinky, huh, ayy!
I just be workin' my wrist like frisby, huh, yuh
Might get your grandmother wet like sinky, huh, yuh
And that my nigga named Mike, sell me Gucci, huh
For the low like free, huh, ayy!
