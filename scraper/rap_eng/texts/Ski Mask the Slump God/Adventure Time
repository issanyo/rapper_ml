[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Can you smell, what VR
Is cooking (All-star!)
Bitch I am ready, ready like I got spaghetti
Heisman
Sauce on me like some spaghetti
(ay ay ay, ay ay ay ay)
Ouch!
Oop, Good Intent on the beat!

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
I be tiptoeing (I be tip!)
I be sneaking geeking (I be sneakin')
Met a bitch named Nicki (Met a bih' named!)
Minaj with her mill meek it (Men mam mit um wit' um)
Yo name on my bullet (Your name on my)
When I hit ya body get freaky (Hit that body)
Cheese up on me like Pizza Hut (Bodied a body)
Or I'm at Chuck E Cheese for the weekend (Cheese!)
I said I be tiptoeing (I be tip!)
I be sneaking geeking (I be sneakin' geekin')
Met a bitch named Nicki (Met a bitch named)
Minaj with her mill meek it (Minaj wit' her mill)
Yo name on my bullet (Your name on my!)
When I hit ya body get freaky (Hit my body)
Cheese up on me like Pizza Hut
Or I'm at Chuck E Cheese for the weekend

[Verse 1: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Okay like (Water!) they just wanna ride my wave
Woulda thought a nigga was a tidal (Water)
Now she saying "Papi cock me!" (Water)
Show her like an old western rifle (Water)
Dick make her sing like American Idol
But symptoms is drowsy like Nyquil (Hee, whoo)
Retake my dick like recital (Retake it!)
Retake my dick like recycle, ayy!
It get low, legs get crossed!
Dick get hard, on your mom!
I'm King Kong! White girl on me
Like Mick Jagger swag my walk (Swag!)
Woulda thought a nigga, Ronda Rousey, how I beat the pussy
Competition lookin' lousy (Knock it out!)
What's new pussycat?
New battle axe to your mouthpiece
Like I be spitting fire
Like I'm Harry Potter with a staff (Look at it!)
You need some new staff
'Cause I'm on they ass just like some grass (Look at my garment!)
Balmains sag off ass
I was counting while I was skippin' class (Fuck math!)
I be tiptoeing (Okay!), smoking on that stank pass gas (Bitch!)
Okay like

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God & DIRTYFACESMOOK]
I be tiptoeing
I be sneaking geeking (Oh my god!)
Met a bitch named Nicki (Ouh)
Minaj with her (Ouh) mill meek it (Ayy oh my god!)
Yo name (Ouh) on my bullet (On my!)
When I hit ya body (Ouh) get freaky
Cheese up on me like Pizza Hut
Or I'm at Chuck E Cheese for the weekend
DIRTYFACESMOOK
I be tiptoeing
I be sneaking geeking (Oh my god!)
Met a bitch named Nicki (Ouh)
Minaj with her (Ouh) mill meek it (Ayy oh my god!)
Yo name (Ouh) on my bullet (On my!)
When I hit ya body (Ouh) get freaky
Cheese up on me like Pizza Hut
Or I'm at Chuck E Cheese for the weekend


[Verse 2: DIRTYFACESMOOK]
I said I be tiptoeing
Walking on the water like I'm Jesus (Bitch, Ski Mask and dirty face!)
Sipping on that wock (I be hardt)
With a stick on me like an old geezer
Wait, red beam on a choppa thats a night light
Hollow tips make a nigga go night night (Bye bye bye)
If you trip, knock 'em out like fight night
So bulldog trained and it might bite (ERRRRR)
Go, I need more
Pick up grabba from the sto'
Do her dance, slit her throat
I'm like a stripper, keep a pole
I'm drippin' you droppin'
I'm poppin' you diggin'
I only wanna talk like a nigga with feelings
I drink too much Henny I need me a kidney
Straight lines off my dick like I'm Bobbi and Whitney
Remixing up work gets you hunnids and fifties
Tell me the truth you ain't got lie to kick it
I'm really with niggas who really be with it
Hop on this wave you be drowning ya feel me?
Take it or leave it
I'll squeeze it if you sneeze it
This bitches is easy, I feel like I'm Weezy
Sneaking and geekin' I'm counting up tokens
I'm ridin' around and I'm Chucky, I'm cheesy
