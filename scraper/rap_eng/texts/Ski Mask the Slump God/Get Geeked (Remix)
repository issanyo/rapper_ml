[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yup, ooh, haha
You know what? Water
Yup

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
I be sharper baby alligator teeth (Sharp, sharp), get geeked
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
I get flyer than a bald eagle beak (Who?), get geeked (Who?)
Get geeked (Who?), get geeked , get geeked, get geeked (Yuh)
Got my diamonds from Wakanda, you can peep
Get geeked, get geeked, uh-huh

[Verse: Ski Mask The Slump God]
These niggas moving funny like they in stilettos (In stilettos)
Tell 'em leggo like I'm talkin' 'bout the Eggo ('Bout the Eggo)
My beak (My beak), for your beak (For your beak)
'Cause I can turn your B into who I see (Who I see)
It's striking (Striking), the lightning (The lightning)
'Cause I be icy like a cup of ICEE (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Exciting, I'm frightening (Ayy)
I'm on they ass like a fuckin' bike seat (Okay)
Big ass belt buckle like Captain K'nuckles
Let my nuts hang like Iâ€™m yo' favorite uncle
Royal like Rumble but no need to tussle
They threw you the backhand and what you did, fumble
Beat on that pussy then dust off my knuckles
No Fast 'N Furious car, I got muscle
They say they killers, like Chucky, I chuckle
I keep some guns and some bands in a duffle (Water)

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
I be sharper baby alligator teeth (Sharp, sharp), get geeked
Get geeked, get geeked, get geeked, get geeked
I get flyer than a bald eagle beak (Who?), get geeked (Who?)
Get geeked (Who?), get geeked , get geeked, get geeked (Yuh)
Got my diamonds from Wakanda, you can peep
