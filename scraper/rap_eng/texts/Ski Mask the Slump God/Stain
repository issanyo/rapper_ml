[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God & Smokepurpp]
Ridin' right 'round with a stick
Uh, yuh
It's too early, I'm gonna fight through
I got a dollar bill for you, yuh (Ayee!)
Yuh, yuh (Oh this shit sound Smokepurpp as fuck, yuh!)
I'm back on you (Yuh)
Wrist on Emmett-
Chains loud! (Yuh) Ayee!

[Chorus: Smokepurpp & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wrist on Emmett Till (Wrist on Emmett)
Ride 'round block with a stick (Ride right round!)
Yeah a nigga pop a few pills (Ride right round!)
Yeah a nigga do it for the drip (Do it for the drip!)
I like white hoes, Emmett Till (White hoes timid)
I got one for the clique (Wet, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

[Post-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Fuckin' on a young white woman (Ay, ay), Emmett Till
Look at my wrist, [?] wrist tilt
Look at my shorts Lil Bill Kill Bill
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts Lil Bill Kill Bill
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts Lil Bill Kill Bill
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts, Kill, Bill, yuh

[Verse: Craig Xen & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Fuck nigga, you a stain
Lil Xen, looking like I just came out a wasp's nest
Take stains, make it rain, blang-thang (Brr!)
With that motherfucker, sitting on his right hip, aye
Bitch, look at my pockets (Look at my)
Look at it, look at it, look at that profit
Money getter, I'ma get it all
Finest slut I slid up in her cunt
Drop top whippin' with your bitch
Spinnin' corners in a '95 Beamer (In a beamer)
Top crop, panties gettin' dropped
And her mouth full of cock I feed her (I feed her)
She wasn't ready (Nah)
Bust like confetti (Brr-ring), all on her titties
Whippin' a foreign, this ain't no Chevy (Damn)
Bitch, my gas unleaded (My gas unleaded!)
Oh shit!
Yeah, ridin' 'round town with- (Yeah)
Aye ('round town)
Aye, yeah, yeah! aye!

[Chorus: Smokepurpp & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wrist on Emmett Till (Wrist on Emmett)
Ride 'round block with a stick (Ride right round!)
Yeah a nigga pop a few pills (Ride right round!)
Yeah a nigga do it for the drip (Do it for the drip!)
I like white hoes, Emmett Till (White hoes timid)
I got one for the clique (Wet, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)

[Post-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Fuckin' on a young white woman (Ay, ay), Emmett Till
Look at my wrist, one-one plus two
Look at my shorts lil' bitch I'm built
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts lil' bitch I'm built
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts lil' bitch I'm built
'Preme shorts on me, Purpp smokin' on ew
Look at my shorts, Kill, Bill, yuh
