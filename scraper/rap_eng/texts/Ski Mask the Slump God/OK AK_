[FROM SNIPPET]

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch, yuh
Spent 'bout a thousand on genuine leather
Muffucker I'm fly as a feather
Treating my body like glue on a letter
Then we sit and talk about the weather
Umm, think that I'm hot? Earth's center
Y'all turn to bitches, Bruce Jenner
And I got sauce like a blender
Smook got the metal like he Bender

[Chorus: DirtyFaceSmook]
Ok AK (brr), boy I got a bad bitch to go both ways (he do!)
Ok (what?) AK (brr), boy I got a bad bitch to go both ways
Ok (what?) AK, boy I got a bad bitch to go both ways (oh my god)
Ok AK (what?), boy I got a bad bitch to go both ways

[Verse 2: VeryRareSantana]
Money all day, fix your bitch in my schedule
Give a bitch wood, give a nigga ass the metal
VVSs do the nae-nae on the bezel
Elephant to a pebble, nigga get up on my level
I been gang-banging since a nigga can remember
