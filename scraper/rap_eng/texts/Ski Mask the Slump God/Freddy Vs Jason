[Verse:  XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bitch, amassed with the pack, no trap lord
Menacing venice, turn your bitch up into a lost cause
"Beauty and the Beast" with the clip, be cautious
Caution,  I murder the pussy, I’m steady flossin'
Aw shit, I leave ‘em corpses, I metamorphous
I’m fancy, lodge your head in the window of Porsches
Call less, in intercourse then got an abortion
Slide in the pussy with Ritalin and abort it
Laughin', I leave the masses straight gaspin'
Caskets, preachin' a murder so light your matches
Nasty tone with a nasty poem
Pretty kitty, dirty vagabond
Tragic, sacrificing sanity for vastness
Belittling vanity, what sanity would be casted?
Half-wet, I leave him half-alive in the basket
And if you not a savage, succumb to the madness

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Ski Mask The Slump God]
Nigga, what you really know about me? ('bout me)
I’m on yo' bitch like clothes, no closet (No closet)
While you worry ‘bout the money I deposit  (I deposit)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (Ok, ok)
Nigga, what you really know about me? (God damn)
I’m on yo' bitch like clothes, no closet (What?)
While you worry ‘bout the money I deposit (What?)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (Ok, ok)
Nigga, what you really know about me? ('bout me)
I’m on yo' bitch like clothes, no closet (No closet)
While you worry ‘bout the money I deposit (I deposit)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (Ok, ok)
Nigga, what you really know about me? ('bout me)
I’m on yo' bitch like clothes, no closet (No closet)
While you worry ‘bout the money I deposit (Ok)
I’m in her mouth like water, no faucet (Ok, ok)
