[Intro: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Huh
Wet

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (To my sister)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (You can get hurt, huh)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Huh, my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister, huh, huh), hey, mister (Mister, huh)
I might give a Glock to my sister (To my what? Huh)
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt (You could get hurt, huh)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Kiss my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)

[Verse: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister)
Yeah, bustin' at these bitches like a blister (Huh)
TSA her any day, I frisk her
Sippin' on this lean until my lips hurt, ow, my liver
Know your pockets hurt, yeah
Renegade, I'm 'bout my currency
You'll get a fist serve, yeah
Balenciaga sock on me all green like the Grinch, sir, yeah
Your diamonds hurricane cloudy, they might need a rinse sir, huh
When I attack her, my dick like a sword, I'ma fence her
Warm up my dick, bench her
Call her my dear, Prancer
When she call my phone, no answer
I'ma dip on the bitch like ranch, sir
Spread the positivity like cancer
Tryna kill my spirits, they can't, sir
Dress retro like a lancer (Ayy, ayy)
Like Spongebob, bitch, my lips hurt

[Chorus: Ski Mask the Slump God]
Hey, mister (Mister), I might give a Glock to my sister (To my, to my)
'Cause it's a dirty world, you could get hurt (Water, you could get hurt)
Told her enemies to kiss my keister (Kiss my keister)
Hey, mister (Hey, mister)
Hey, mister, mister, I might give a Glock to my sister
It's a dirty world, you could get hurt
Told her enemies to kiss my keister
Mister
Hey, mister
