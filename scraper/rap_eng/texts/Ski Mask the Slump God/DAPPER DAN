[Intro]
Yes I'm still off of the new-
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Who is it?
Slime
Uh, who is it?
Water!
Shout out, no mucus (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Yeah, um, okay (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
Natra

[Verse 1]
Never be sleeping 'cause I'm woke, bitch
And yes, I'm still off of the Newport, bitch, uh
I'm off dope bitch, she said my dick dope, bitch
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Ride me like animal
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Eat my meat just like a cannibal
I wanna spoon that bitch like she a Danimals
I be as fly as a bird with a beak
My chain as wet as the world's biggest cameltoe
I smell yo' jealousy, boy, do it stink
So check out the Cuban links on top of the mink
It's wetter than my bathroom sink (wet!)
Niggas that think they know me think I think Iâ€™m giving a fuck what they speak
So I tell 'em-

[Chorus]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up (woo!)
My energy get up like it do a sit-up
I got the bitch lit up (ayy)
And I tell 'em, "fuck you bitch"
And tell 'em suck my dick until you hiccup
Get up-

[Verse 2]
Niggas fly like Peter Pan, call me Dapper Dan
Yes, I got a fan made of money up in my hand
And I got a cannon, no Nick and no drum and band
Hotter than some sun on the beach when you're tryna tan
Take a xan, 'cause I might scare ya like boogeyman
But really man, I pull up and droptop the minivan, man
And a nigga rollin' like coasters at Disney Land
(And a nigga rollin' like coasters at Disney Land, man)
Jump on a nigga like a pitbull, diamond biker chains, uh (water!)
When she sucking on my dick, sound like she eatin' lo mein, ho
People swearing that they know the real me, bitch it's getting creepy (look at it, look at it)
For everybody hating on me, suck my dick, bitch
Can't sauce like me (suck it!)
Okay like-
[Chorus]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up (woo!)
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up
My energy get up like it do a sit-up
I got this bitch lit up (ayy)
So I tell 'em, "fuck you bitch"
And tell 'em suck my dick until you hiccup
Get up
