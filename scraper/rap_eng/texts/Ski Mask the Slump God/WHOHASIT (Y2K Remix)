[Intro: Nessly]
Hehehe
Yeah, young Nessly, young Nessly
Ayy, Nessly still finessin'
Yeah, Nessly still finessin', yeah
Yeah, Nessly still finessin', Nessly still finessin'

[Chorus: Nessly]
Flex habit, I'm a sex addict
I don't text her back, she said I'm movin' backwards
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?

[Verse 1: Nessly]
He said he moonwalkin', he just movin' backwards
I'm really Michael Jordan, I dance like Michael Jackson
I'ma snatch a Grammy, I'ma snatch a Lambo
I hit her with no condom, she look like Naomi Campbell
I love her mind, she give me brain though
I take off my chain before bed, I feel like Django
I don't work in restaurants, come through with a bread basket
Yeah, ayy, bitch I'm next, who has it?

[Chorus: Nessly]
I got a flex habit, I'm a sex addict
I don't text her back, she said I'm movin' backwards
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Yeah, bitch I'm next, who has it?
I got a flex habit, I'm a sex addict
I don't text her back, she said I'm movin' backwards
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Yeah, bitch I'm next, who has it?

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Think a nigga got a flex habit, and I'm a sex addict
Is that a bird? is that a plane? No bitch I'm fly like Aladdin (like what?)
If a nigga run up then a nigga done up, gotta hit him with the Megaman cannon (duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh)
Until the sun up, until the sun out, runnin' to the carats like a rabbit (run, run)
Mayonnaise whippin', I'm in it (mayonnaise whip)
My hip to my pistol, magnetic (my hip to my hip)
I fuck on your aunt until she get a headache, then after while she got that neck (bitch, ayy)
Got her head on lock like dreadhead (what?)
Birthday suit, I got her naked (what?)
The rattlesnake inside that bitch is shakin'
I wonder how long she can take it
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh (ayy), A-1 perico, white coke
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh (water), it look like Ski bought some more dope (bitch)
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh, I just spilled lean on your ho (I just spilled lean)
Yuh yuh yuh yuh yuh, cheetah printed Louboutin toes (look at it, look at it)
Yuh yuh
Chain on my neck look like water, no bath, umm (no bath)
They hate me but keep to themselves (themself)
You gon' live today just like Hef (like Hef)
My bitch bad, just look at her nails (the nail)
Your money so short just like elf (the elf)
You can't put a nigga on shelf (no shelf)
My diamonds so heavy, need help
Yuh yuh yuh yuh

[Chorus: Nessly]
I got a flex habit, I'm a sex addict
I don't text her back, she said I'm movin' backwards
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Yeah, bitch I'm next, who has it?
I got a flex habit, I'm a sex addict
I don't text her back, she said I'm movin' backwards
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
Bitch I'm next, who has it?
