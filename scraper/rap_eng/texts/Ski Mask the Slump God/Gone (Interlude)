[Interlude]
Nigga impatient, gone gone
Nigga impatient, gone, gone
See anythin'?
Contemplatin', I don’t want my soul to go to satan at all
Waitin', wait, wait, wait (oh where did it go?)
Sittin' and thinkin'
Contemplatin', I don’t want my soul to go to satan at all
Wrist impatient, impatient
Wrist said like fuck patience like oh again
Pain, pain
Pain, pain
Pain, pain
Do you feel my lane?
Feel me? lane, lane, lane
Gone
