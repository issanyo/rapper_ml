[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Have you ever seen Balmain jeans with the leather pepperminted-feather printed knee patch?

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, bad back, bad back
Got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback
Bad back, bad back, got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback bitch

[Verse 1: Don Dolla the 48 Lord]
[?]
Rollin' blunts like my pizza stuffed crust
Place your order right now what you want, what you want
I want a bad bitch straight from Vermont
I could pull up right now
Serve it by the hundred pounds
Serve it by the hundred rounds
Free my guys locked down
I ball like they was with me
See more white than Mrs. Whitney
I swear this life is so filthy
I'm ballin' like my name 50

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Bad back, bad back
Got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback
Bad back, bad back, got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback bitch

[Verse 2: DirtyFaceSmook]
Look like speak better pipe down
Got stick, got stick plus a hunnid rounds
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, better flush the toilet now
Need a brick, need a brick, not a quarter pound
Got a little pin jacket with the faux fur
I don't box got a tommy in my boxers
Fuck 12 I don't fuck with no coppers
Got the baseball I'm ridin' on the oppers
Got your bitch on my shit she was like oou oou oou oou
When we pull up we hop out then we pew pew pew pew
Been a rebel since a youngin breaking ru-ru-ru rules
Like I'm Curry off the pick I'm finna shoot shoot shoot shoot

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy, ayy, bad back, bad back
Got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback
Bad back, bad back, got a stick like I got a bad back
Bad back, bad back, got that sack run that like a quarterback bitch
