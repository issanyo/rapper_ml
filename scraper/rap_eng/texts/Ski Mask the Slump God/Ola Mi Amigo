[Chorus: Kofi Harris]
Hola mi amigo

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
I'm like "Hola" like I'm Dora
I'm not Spanish, in that pussy, I explore her
Minnesota, caught her daughter, suck my dick and throw up
Me and Niggas throwing up the 4's up
Tell my nigga Gio like "Roll Up"
Cold out, snow out, .44's out
Hanging out the van with the pistols
I'ma make you pop it like Cristal
It is a showdown
Creep up on a nigga like a [?]
Hanging with your bitch at the [?]
Fuck her and she sound like a cow now
Okay move, you gotta move
Just like a Austin Power movie, bitch, I think that I got groove
Just like a Thriller and I'm Michael Jackson, bitch, I think I'm smooth
She gon' do what it do, give me that neck right in a pool

[Chorus: Kofi Harris]
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
Hola mi amigo
