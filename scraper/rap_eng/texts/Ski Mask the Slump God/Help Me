[Intro]
Said she won't change me
Said they won't change me
Said change me

[Chorus]
And I can't help it, if I feel insane
It's the rhythm, of your eyes and pain

[Verse]
Let me in, hey
And no, my soul is broken
No, my heart can't open
Now, it's really ice
I need something to change my life
And no, the soul is broken
No, my heart won't open
Now, it's really ice
I need something to change my life

[Bridge]
And change me, change me
Said change me, change me
They, changed me

[Chorus]
I can't help it, if I feel insane
It's the rhythm, of your eyes and pain

[Outro]
Help me, please
Please, please
Yeah, yeah, help me
And no, please
And no, help me
