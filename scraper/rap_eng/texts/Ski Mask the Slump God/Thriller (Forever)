[Intro: Ronny J]
Oh my God, Ronny!
Ayy

[Chorus: Ronny J]
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together

[Verse 1: Ronny J]
Droppin' the top on my coupe, uh
I fuck that bitch she like ooh, uh
I got the space in my shoes, uh
I do not know how they lose, uh
I got my jewelry that's sparkling, ayy
I'm ballin', ballin' like Barkley, ayy
I'm rolling it up, big broccoli
You are a lame, don't talk to me, ayy
I want that money forever, I'm in designer forever
I got two bitches together, I get these bitches whenever
Eyes on my feet, that's Fendi, places on me that's offending
Big big racks, no bending

[Chorus: Ronny J]
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hotline Bling, Drake price for a feature
Ten toes down, no bleachers, mm
Where The Wild Things Are, I am a creature
Goose golden egg for a feature, uh
All black fleece on my neck Y-3
Looking like I am the fucking Grim Reaper, uh
Your bitch a tweaker, molly she geeker
Hold on my dick she get neater, uh
Shh, I am so high, just like it Futurama, bitch I'm Fry, uh, yuh
Just like she Yoshi
When she see my dick is how she gon' ride, ayy!
I cannot speak no bilingual
Yo' bitch see my dick give it tickle, uh, yuh
Why yo' bitch smell like a pickle?
I pull up with metal and nickel, uh, yuh
Ice on my wrist like a â€˜cicle
Might spawn on yo' bitch like a freckle, uh, yuh
I just might chuckle like Chuckie
'Cause saved me some money like gecko, uh

[Chorus: Ronny J]
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I'm on a whole 'nother level, ooh
I want this life forever, I want that money forever
All of my diamonds are better, I want two bitches together
