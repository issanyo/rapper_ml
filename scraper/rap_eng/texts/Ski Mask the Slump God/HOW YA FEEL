[Intro]
Listen to this track bitch!

[Hook: Lil HBK & Montie]
How ya feel, how ya feel
Wanna mill, wanna mill
Is it beef lil bitch
Nigga tell me what's the deal
Dodge cops in the drop top
And a young nigga got the wheel
Keep it real or get killed
How ya feel, how ya feel
Choppers got em out and rush ya
Wrong move I'ma bust ya
Bullets touch you like buster
And the swag so disgusting
Skrt skrt in the Beamer
Shades on can't see ya
Boutta flex, blow a check
And I'll steal ya mamacita

[Verse 1: Montie]
Pulled up and I hate y'all
Like a plane I'm bout to take off
Lil bitch suckin dick
I'm about to blow her face off
Bitch we can have a face off
Matter fact let's have a dual
Why you gotta do him cruel
To these hoes I'm a tool
I like those jeans can I get in them
Ima eat the pussy like an m&m
Girl what's the use of them pants
Ass too fat can't fit in them
Whoo shit
Ass too thick
But I know she can't drive
So she ride my stick
Lil bitch lil bitch
I want hella millions
Stack em to the ceiling
I don't want no ceiling
I don't have no feeling
Fuck nigga in his feelings

[Hook: Lil HBK & Montie]
How ya feel, how ya feel
Wanna mill, wanna mill
Is it beef lil bitch
Nigga tell me what's the deal
Dodge cops in the drop top
And a young nigga got the wheel
Keep it real or get killed
How ya feel, how ya feel
Choppers got em out and rush ya
Wrong move I'ma bust ya
Bullets touch you like buster
And the swag so disgusting
Skrt skrt in the Beamer
Shades on can't see ya
Boutta flex, blow a check
And I'll steal ya mamacita

[Verse 2: Lil HBK]
They don't treat ya boy the same
Hate a nigga watch my chain hang
You a plain Jane and a lame
1500 make it rain
30,000 that's my wrist
Never spend it on a bitch
Butterfly's on the new whip
And my new shit so lit
Turn it up, turn it up
Yeah a nigga in the spot
Switch it up, switch it up
And I'm boutta drop the top
New girls, it's a new world
But the cash flow don't stop
Diamonds on a Nigga neck
Shining karats with the rocks
Flame rain when I spit that
30 round clip, better get back
Stay in her mouth like tic tacs
Then a nigga break her off like a kit Kat
Did they not know that I be doing the most
I'm switching lanes in the ghost
And I stay wavy like the coast let's go

[Outro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Wavy on a boat but I'm not lil boat
Just like its a lil boat bitch my flow afloat
Aim [?]
30 in a young nigga coat
Aim for the chin hit the throat
Grip on my cash like a rope
