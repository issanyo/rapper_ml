[Intro]
Ayy, durags
I got the Henn
'Cause Hennything is possible
Ayy, you niggas food
And my bitch look like Kim Possible

[Chorus]
I don't count my money
Money counter count my money
Poo on you niggas like bear
But bitch I got no honey
I just got my Tommy
Make sure you mow that lawn
Snakes in the grass lil' dummy
Sex from the nigga hurt her tummy
First I wrap my dick like a mummy
Okay like, I don't count my money
Money counter count my money
Poo you niggas like bear
But bitch I got no honey
I just got my Tommy
Make sure you mow that lawn
Snakes in the grass lil' dummy
Sex from the nigga hurt her tummy
First I wrap my dick like a mummy

[Verse]
Okay like Kurt, Kurt, Kurt, Kurt
Angle, I bend your bitch Kurt
All in that bitch like insert
Ten times like Ben, like a nerf
Ten times like Ben, like a nerf
Hold up, burp
I ate that beef now you hurt
Smook said his face skin is dirt
Okay like still hit that lick, never scurred
I hit your bitch something like I drove and hit the curb
Catch me a cold from the diamond that up on my wrist
Always be freshly served
Yellow diamonds, need to use the restroom
Told me "gotta peepee"
I was like "word?"

[Bridge]
I think you heard, know you heard
I might flip the bird, flip the bird
I think you heard, what you heard? What you heard?
I might flip the bird, bird is the word

[Chorus]
I don't count my money
Money counter count my money
Poo on you niggas like bear
But bitch I got no honey
I just got my Tommy
Make sure you mow that lawn
Snakes in the grass lil' dummy
Sex from the nigga hurt her tummy
First I wrap my dick like a mummy
Okay like, I don't count my money
Money counter count my money
Poo you niggas like bear
But bitch I got no honey
I just got my Tommy
Make sure you mow that lawn
Snakes in the grass lil' dummy
Sex from the nigga hurt her tummy
First I wrap my dick like a mummy
