[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yo, you ever seen that episode of uhh
The third take almost fell through the door, I remember it
That SpongeBob, where Sandy was like, "I wanna go  ho-oome"
(I'm sweatin', I feel like a wet beverage 'cause it's water!)
That's how I feel fam
What?! Ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
King Julien, need my crown, hol' up
I like to wear Off-White in my town, and what?
Rich said he got us more white just like a gown, and what?
Look at my coat, it is just black and brown, uh

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hi my name savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
Hi my name savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
I'm not 21, 'cause neither a gun nor knife
Mike Tyson you like the fuckin' bite
I might be flippin' the bird at sun or night
Because the Desert Eagle is my night-night

[Verse 1: Rich2Litt]
Big Benji in my pocket blue 'cause he can't breathe
For the guap, run around the block like an athlete
Keep the hammer with me 'cause these niggas wanna catch me
When I see him, beat his ass, and leave the scene nasty
New MacBook from a crack head for 30 cash
Pull off in a foreign whip with a .220 on the dash
Came a long way, man I bagged up a thousand grams
So much money now I gotta re-up rubber bands
Weed is so purple that shit lookin' like a bruise
Hit this shit so hard I make it feel like it's abused
And my weed so sticky think I used gorilla glue
Pull up to my hood, we show you what gorillas do
Pop a nigga top that shit it soundin' like a Snapple cap
I don't ever lie, ask about me I got Snapple facts
When niggas touch my work they say it break off like an avalanche
Shit so oily it won't come off if you wash your hands
Three whips on the highway, one full of coke
My mans crash the whip if the cops come I'm getting low
Shorty riding with me shotgun and she keep the toast
Dog I'm hitting 130 in a rush I gotta go
Red cookies backpack and that shit is filled with dope
Smoking from California up until I hit New York
I will never stop 'cause I'm hungry for this chicken
Niggas want a hundred thou, dog I want a billion

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
Hi my name savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
I'm not 21, 'cause neither a gun nor knife
Mike Tyson you like the fuckin' bite
I might be flippin' the bird at some or none
Because the Desert Eagle is my night-night

[Bridge: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Ayy ayy, ayy, ayy
Huh (water!)
Ayyyy! Yuh, yuh

[Verse 2: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Beat up on a nigga like Piccolo
Gigolo, tippy-toe
In my new Rick Owens with a missin' toe
Kisses from your misses then I stroke her hole
Make her make a face like she just stepped on Legos
My bitch hot, like kettle
Then make a face like we playing Simon Says so
She say your dick is small as a wet Lego
Racks on me, I say 'bout 50 like Mayweather's score
Up like an uppercut and I'm sharp as daggers, hoe
How did my wrist so cold call me fuckin' Frozone
Way that the pistol sound sound like I just made it mow
But I don't need your help, fuck nigga rather just help myself
But I don't need your help, fuck nigga rather just help myself

[Pre-Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
King Julien, need my crown, hol' up
I like to wear Off-White in my town, and what?
Rich said he got us more white just like a gown, and what?
Look at my coat, it is just black and brown, uh

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hi my name savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
Hi my name savage, savage, savage, savage, savage
So shout-out to savage
I'm not 21, 'cause neither a gun nor knife
Mike Tyson you like the fuckin' bite
I might be flippin' the bird at some or none
Because the Desert Eagle is my night-night
