[Verse]
Purp smoke to the chest, choke that motherfucker, uh
Choker on me, think they got my choker motherfucker, uh
This me stating, underdogs ain't joking motherfucker, uh
Just to get sleepy, sippin' on syrup
[?] under my covers
Bet I can fuck your mother
I'm sharp like a fucking cutter
She wet like the fucking gutters
And just like a nature lover
I'm wishing a nigga would've
Before his bitch start to suck it
I stop and remind her to ask to pucker
I am a motherfucker
And Craig is a chicken plucker
He told me your bitch's booty is hubba bu-bubba bubba
She told me that when you fuck her
She boo you just like the ruckus
I hate niggas uncle ruckus
They goofy and bubble blowers
Ayy bitch, this is my hypothesis, mm
Photosynthesis upon her pussy lips, mm
Clip like the peacoat, her face a pelican, mm
Hole in your body size hippopotamus, mm
Ten toe rings, Prince of Persia pimp lent
Put a hole in a nigga just like a cartilage, mm
They thought I didn't come from the bottom bitch
But I say that I work for this spot like a bottom bitch, mm
