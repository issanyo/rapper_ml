[Hook: Offset & Reese LAFLARE]
Hop in the wraith, it’s a ghost (ghost)
How much you pay? what’s your gross? (how much?)
Come take a dive in the ocean (dive)
Give me your phone, you can’t post (krr)
I do not brag or boast (no no)
You see the diamonds, they show (you see)
She took a land of coke (coca)
Then took them bricks on the road
Money on the line
That’s that bread phone
Money talk long
Bring them racks, bring them racks
Money counter sound
That’s my ringtone
All about the benjamins
That’s my theme song

[Verse 1: Reese LAFLARE & Offset]
Walk right in this bitch
Bankroll on my waist
Money smell all in this Gucci
I won’t change my clothes
Money talk some more
I might change my flow
Yellow diamonds, Lisa Simpson
Money got me trippin’
Back to the basics, count up all these faces
I run to the money, I tied up my laces
You trappin’ you trappin’, don’t go out like [?]
If you in the streets why you showin’ your paper?
Young nigga I had a master planI just got a hundred in Africa
Every day I get a bag-a-than
You know what that mean, that’s them rack-a-than’s
Shawty look like Marilyn Monroe
Count up the racks at the shows
Draco break dance on the floor
I love how that draco reload
Draco come right through your door
Draco be ringing like phones
Draco be rocking like stones
That draco don’t play with you folks
Add it up, add it up, add it in
Doin’ real numbers, no time for friends
My family got the same eyes and legs
Shoot ‘em ten times, make ‘em die again
I’m sippin’ codeine for brunch I make a hit, it’s a Mike Tyson punch
I get the percs and the narcs from the aunt
Run to the money, get cardio ones

[Verse 2: Reese LAFLARE & Key!]
I think I might get me a Lam today
How yo diamonds do that dance?
How yo phone made of money?
Why them bands make you sag?
I glamor all my glitz
Patek Philippe my wrist
Money on my plate
Uber man, take this
I’m fuckin mujeres, you niggas do better
My foot on they neck and I bet I won’t let up
I huncho’ed your ho in the field like a ‘ception
She suck on the dick ‘til she hiccup
I bought a new truck
Press on the gas and it lift up
I press on the gas and I’m gone
Bitch you not main, ho leave me alone, lone
Niggas want handouts, niggas want loans, gone
Niggas want handouts, niggas want loans, gone
