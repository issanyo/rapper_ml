Takin' that whip to the block Rocks on my side with a Glock
Biscuits like Vivica Fox keepin' my blocks in the spot
Workin' that cul-de-sac killer holdin' that
Mini 14 with the shoulder strap
Notice that it is just buisness i am not kidding
Drop a deuce bring a deuce and just whip it
Wrist is amazing  pockets on crazy
