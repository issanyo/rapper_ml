[Intro: No Plug & Offset]
Yeah, yeah, Offset
No future, Slaughter Gang
Yeah, yeah
Boy, you ain't droppin, ain't cop shit
Nope!

[Hook: Offset]
Boy, you ain't drop, you ain't cop shit
Talkin' 'bout the Glock, you ain't pop shit
I got mo' keys than a locksmith
Patek diamond flip, do a cartwheel
Pick out what you want, get a bag or a key
Hundred round, better get the kids out the street
Blue strip hundreds and they stack real neat
Flooded water, come and take a dive in Philippe
You out here playin' games and a nigga tryna cheat
You ain't got no stain in the game, take a seat
Got a whole fifty ball in the Goyard brief
Thot little bitches and they all gon' knee
Glock with a missile, take a dog off his feet
Pot in the kitchen, make a milly out the street
Keep quiet in the kitchen 'cause the babies all sleep
Watch the young nigga 'cause the young nigga creep

[Verse 1: Offset]
We do not hide, stick with the 9
Kel-Tec, bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah
Caught his ass slippin, he flexin', no lie
He thought I was sweet because I'm from Nawfside
Mama told me not to hang with them guys
That all of 'em snitches and all of 'em pie
Duct tape his mouth if he do not comply
Light the bitch up like the 4th of July
My diamonds is cool, money long like a Jew
Louboutins drippin', two thousand a shoe
Two on the mission, two Glocks in the coupe
You had them benjies, what happened to you?
Young niggas we got the throne, but we grown
Gone, holmes, not pickin' no bone
Don't know what he on, but this lil boy better watch out his tone
Sit back and we called his name in a song
Migos, No Plug over here, we alone
At your front door with a nigga, ding-dong
Watchin', they copy, these wannabe clones
They don't want war 'cause the money too long
(Brr, brr, brr, brr)

[Hook: Offset]
Boy, you ain't drop, you ain't cop shit
Talkin' 'bout the Glock, you ain't pop shit
I got mo' keys than a locksmith
Patek diamond flip, do a cartwheel
Pick out what you want, get a bag or a key
Hundred round, better get the kids out the street
Blue strip hundreds and they stack real neat
Flooded water, come and take a dive in Philippe
You out here playin' games and a nigga tryna cheat
You ain't got no stain in the game, take a seat
Got a whole fifty ball in the Goyard brief
Thot little bitches and they all gon' knee
Glock with a missile, take a dog off his feet
Pot in the kitchen, make a milly out the street
Keep quiet in the kitchen 'cause the babies all sleep
Watch the young nigga 'cause the young nigga creep

[Verse 2: No Plug]
Whip off the lot, crack in the pot
Told Offset, boy I can't cook in the crockpot
Want a whole brick? Just meet me at the trap spot
Know I got a set like J. J. Watt
Bankroll on me, bitch thick like snot
Drop the whole muh'fuckin' brick on the watch
Louie on my wrist [?]
Give me 60 minutes, I can cook a 36
All this water got a nigga seasick
Four to the nine, nigga that's a remix
Tell baby dawg I was just cookin' cheese grits
All this muh'fuckin' gold like the A-Team
Been ballin' on niggas since 18
I got China white bitch, call it Beijing
And a knife when I pull up in a Saleen
Nigga got scared when he see the red beam
I ain't for [?] nigga, know we gon ride
Slaughter Gang Music but I'm breakin' down pies
Turn a deuce to a four nigga, oh my
Servin' niggas in Alabama, rollin' tide
Nigga tryna shoot, but he closed his eyes
When a nigga play nigga jumpin' offside
Flag on a play, I'ma hit him with the K
I catch him at Lenox I'ma do him broad day

[Hook: Offset]
Boy, you ain't cop shit
Talkin' 'bout the Glock, you ain't pop shit
I got mo' keys than a locksmith
Patek diamond flip, do a cartwheel
Pick out what you want, get a bag or a key
Hundred round, better get the kids out the street
Blue strip hundreds and they stack real neat
Flooded water, come and take a dive in Philippe
You out here playin' games and a nigga tryna cheat
You ain't got no stain in the game, take a seat
Got a whole fifty ball in the Goyard brief
Thot little bitches and they all gon' knee
Glock with a missile, take a dog off his feet
Pot in the kitchen, make a milly out the street
Keep quiet in the kitchen 'cause the babies all sleep
Watch the young nigga 'cause the young nigga creep
