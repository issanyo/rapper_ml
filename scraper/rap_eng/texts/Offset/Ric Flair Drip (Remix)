[Intro: 2Pac]
Niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (squeeze)
Niggas don't know my style (fuck everybody, fuck that nigga)
Niggas don't know my style
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (fuck that nigga)
(fuck you too nigga)

[Verse 1: 2pac]
Hit me, I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm gettin' high off buddha 'cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
And that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You can holler if you want to, please
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew, bleed
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, now hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin, down on Rikers Isle
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles

Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Chorus: Offset]
Going to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slide on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope so do not test me, (drrt) yeah (drrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, split the coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb' and drop the roof, show the tits (skrr)

[Verse 2: Offset]
Poppin' but you really not gon' shoot (pop it)
Ninety pointers down my diamonds look like hula hoops (ninety)
Hopping in my Bentayga and her seat is a masseuse (hey)
Balenciaga, check my posture, Valentino boots (oo-oo)
It's the Boominati way, a lotta Lambs, a lotta Wraiths (Boominati)
Never hesitate to give a nigga yellow tape (grrt)
Ain't worried 'bout the bag 'cause the cash accumulatin (bags)
Soon as we came in the game, all these niggas they imitate it (hey)

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run'em up
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye

[Chorus: Offset]
Yeah
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety split the coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb' and drop the roof, show the tits (skrr)
Going to the jeweler, bust the AP, yeah (bust it)
Slide on the water like a jet-ski, yeah (woo, slide)
I'm tryna fuck you and your bestie, yeah (hey)
Chopper with the scope so do not test me, (drrt) yeah (drrt)
Ric Flair drip, go "woo" on a bitch (woo)
Fifty-seven ninety, split the coupe on my wrist (ice)
Multi-million dollar, I'm a fool with the hits (ayy)
Hop up in the Lamb' and drop the roof, show the tits (skrr)
