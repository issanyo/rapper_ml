From a Music Mafia snippet...

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you (Hey!)

Spend this shit get this shit right back (spend it)
Eat up my drip, they bite that (eat)
You disappear for a light check (phew)
Fuck on yo' bitch, one night that (smash)
You got the [?] for sure (sure)
Look at my neck, my lord (my lord)
The pot, [?]
[?] whippin' a tortoise
[?]
Imma go bust your watch (bust down, bust down)
