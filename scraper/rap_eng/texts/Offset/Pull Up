[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Park the whip, park it
Start the whip, start it
Pop the shit, pop it
Fuck on your bitch
She lovin' the clique, I play with the clit (play with it)
She pick up the bag, I make her go to work, and pay her in dick
My cars are tint (tinted)
Put the stars in vics
No flaws, cars fit in my garage, about to m√©nage a bitch
I got her number, got head from her, never gon call the bitch
Double R Ghost with the stars in the ceiling, foot out the window with the wrist, fuck em up
No need to talk, they know what the deal is
Don't fuck with the kid
I pull up and shoot at your wig and your kids
You fuck with the pigs
Niggas know who, niggas know you
You told them who, bringing the crew
Boom Boom
Kick down your door bo-boom

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Park the Bentley on the curb
Diamonds came out the earth
Her pussy water when I'm kickin'
Her pussy water wanna surf
Auntie got a pack of percs
Put a nigga on a shirt
He pulled up, and he hopped out
But I had to shoot the nigga first
Took a bitch from the bottom
Name a pack, I done bought em
I met the plug at Ramada
Put the packs in the columns
Mac and cheese no collards
Big mac, no whopper
Macintosh no Apple
Mac 11 for the hackers

[Verse 3: Offset]
Hop out the robotic, this how I go bout it
Migos pulled up with Dracos I don't low ride em
Yeah he a man but the stick bout to hole wide em
Stick to the code, who got shot, I don't know bout it
Who, huh we sellin' bombs, Saddam
I smell more millions to come
We spend a hundred for fun
