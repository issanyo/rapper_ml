[Hook]
Trap out my habitat
Front you the work bring the money back
Do the job I'll bring the Renault back
Got a whole brick in my fanny pack
I got dope in my inner tube
I served the molly the dog food
You signed to QC that's a power move
I shit on you niggas like biol movement
That's a power move
Power-Move
Power-Move
Power-Move
Hunnid round chopper don't make me act a fool
Power-Move
Power-Move
Power-Move
Power-Move

[Verse 1]
QC my label we powerful
Bentley Ferrari my caliber
I got young niggas on capital
Pulling up with the chopper Texas Massacre
When I'm sitting in the Bentley pull the curtain down
Trappin' and cappin' I'm tryna get about a hundred pounds
Call me [?] I'm trapping in the underground
Started with a four but then I whipped it to a nine
I got [?] the money after my time
Made a million just off speaking my mind
Sipping Actavis a hundred a line
When I'm pulling up nigga I'm shooting like Shine
It's a power move
Turning my wrist in the pot Typhoon
You a monkey nigga call a nigga [?]
You bitches be sucking on niggas call that bitch a vacuum

[Hook]
Trap out my habitat
Front you the work bring the money back
Do the job I'll bring the Renault back
Got a whole brick in my fanny pack
I got dope in my inner tube
I served the molly the dog food
You signed to QC that's a power move
I shit on you niggas like biol movement
That's a power move
Power-Move

Hunnid round chopper don't make me act a fool
Power-Move
