[Intro: Duke Deuce]
What the fuck
Baow, baow

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload

[Verse 1: Duke Deuce]
Make one call, we gotta creep
We pullin' up on your fuckin' street
Nigga got me fucked up if you think he gon' S-L-I-D-E
Once your home bitch find out bet they ain't comin' down for a fuckin' week
Three y'all might be wolves, but the rest of them niggas, they fuckin' sheep
Ten toes on my feet, huh, put it on a G, huh
I won't go out weak, huh, Neiman with the heat, huh
Big dog, ain't no leash, huh, Black Haven, Tennessee, huh
Diamonds on my teeth, huh, Piggies rest in peace, huh
Leaches, robbers, dealers, killers
Back in the day the whole hood was full of hitters
Rather ride alone 'cause I don't trust too many niggas
Fuck a middle finger, flick 'em off with the pistol

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hundred round on the draco
Yeah, yeah, wipe that boy nose
Hang out the car with the scope
I miss the head, well I caught the earlobe, yeah
Most of these niggas be hoes
Don't fold, we stick to the code
My bankroll just growin' up mold
Pull up off in the peppermint Rolls
These niggas around me ign'ant
Gun your ass down for a fifty
Thirty round dick, nigga lick it
This Bentley coupe crawl like a cricket
We all we got but we wicked
They click it, click it, click it
I'm payin' my lawyer two-fifty
The feds grabbed Murk for extensions (free Murk)
Your bitch all up in my mentions
But I think it's a set-up, don't hit it
The Nawfside run the whole city
I got all-stars throwin' me kitty
I get exhausted, sip and I feel it
My wrist made of frost, it's straight out the frigid
My bro caught a body, the charge got acquitted
They lost the body, said what they did with it? (where?)

[Chorus: Duke Deuce]
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Hop out and let it unload, hop out and let it unload
Told y'all don't fuck with my folks
Got me fucked up, now it's on
Caught they ass gon' on the scrolls
Hop out and let it unload
