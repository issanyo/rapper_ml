[Intro: Offset]
M&Ms, M&Ms, hey

[Chorus: Offset + Blac Youngsta]
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms
Them lil' funny bitches on Instagram
Me and Offset fucked like ten of them
Lamborghini we ain't rentin' them
These niggas broke we not built like them
Fresh out the courthouse, now I'm sittin' courtside
When I fucked your bitch, I took her to the abort house
She's a lil' sore now, but who gives a fuck 'bout her
You really care about her, treat that lil' bitch like a nobody

[Verse 1: Offset]
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I got the racks and you know it
Sippin' on Act, we don't Moët
Put on my diamonds, I show it
My pockets are swole, on steroids
Sippin' on Actavis, paranoid
Drop top Phantom on Melrose
Before the rap, it was a elbow
Where is my top, where the hell it go?
Fuckin' your bitch, need to let her go
If I go on a lick you'd be scared though
I'm trappin', but duckin' the feds though
I'm rich, I'm not average, I'm a bastard
My cars is way more faster
I'm outer space like I'm with NASA
I'm stompin' 'em out like a Alpha, Kappa
I give out the dot like a raffle
I'm not with all that bibble and babble
Just bought my momma a big castle
You flexin', you a actor
I'm flyer than a pterodactyl
They bitin' the dab like a apple
Thankin' god I'm not in no shackles

[Chorus: Offset + Blac Youngsta]
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms
Lil funny bitches on Instagram
Me and Offset fucked like ten of them
Lamborghini we ain't rentin' them
These niggas broke we not built like them
Fresh out the courthouse, now I'm sittin' courtside
When I fucked your bitch, I took her to the abort house
She's a lil sore now, but who gives a fuck 'bout her
You really care about her, treat that lil bitch like a nobody (fuck nigga)

[Verse 2: Blac Youngsta]
Reach for my chain, fifty .45 ya
I'ma shoot out your ho 'bout ya
I'ma kill all of your folks by ya
I'ma dip out for my lowrider
I be sellin' lots of coke out here (fuck nigga)
I be frontin' to my folks out here
I be sendin' that pack, its straight from Oakland
You know prices they get low out here
I do not have no kinfolks out here
So I cannot trust a soul out here
I'ma hit 'em with Mac 11 (Brr)
If you try to play me like ho out here
Yeah I run my, run my money up
You niggas broke, they not rich as us
All my hitters in the club at one time
Sneakin' my gun out it in my nuts
I spent two hundred on my whip
I just put tint on my windows
I got rentals for my hittas
I won't hesitate to send em
Little fuck nigga wanna gunplay
Shoot a lil' nigga on a Sunday
Put the gun in the lil' nigga mouth
Make his ass sing like Beyoncé

[Chorus: Offset + Blac Youngsta]
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms
M&Ms, M&Ms, stack up your money, get M&Ms

Fresh out the courthouse, now I'm sittin' courtside
When I fucked your bitch, I took her to the abort house
She's a lil sore now, but who gives a fuck 'bout her
You really care about her, treat that lil bitch like a nobody
