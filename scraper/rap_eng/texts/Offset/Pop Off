[Intro]
Yeah
She took her clothes off
I'm 'bout to pop off
I'm 'bout to...

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to pop off, yeah
She took her clothes off, yeah
On drink I nod off, yeah
Rack stacks in the wall, yeah
Copped the coupe man shit get froggy
Wrist cost me one-forty
Four rings on no Audi
Rockstar jeans, I'm gnarly
I am the life of the party
I am the one in the 'Rari
I am the one with the molly
I'm 'bout to catch a body (Offset!)
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm 'bout to fuck me a thottie
Beat up the pussy like Ali
I know it's your nature, get naughty
Ooh, these haters, they feelin' so salty
Patek cost sixty plus forty
If you talking 'bout money involve me (C'mon!)
I'm 'bout to hop in the Wraith or somethin'
I'm 'bout to fill up my safe with somethin'
Heard you been buildin' a case for months
Hit them with AK for breakfast or lunch
There go a murder
Savages, we take the beef out the burger
Green Lamborghini, pull up there go Kermit
Three hundred shots, that's ten niggas with thirties
How 'bout I pipe up the crowd
White girls showin' titties, girls goin' wild
Price on your head right above your eyebrows
Bring me a towel
Watery diamonds, bling, bow

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to pop off, yeah
She took her clothes off, yeah
On drink I nod off, yeah
Rack stacks in the wall, yeah
Copped the coupe man shit get froggy
Wrist cost me one-forty
Four rings on no Audi
Rockstar jeans, I'm gnarly
I am the life of the party
I am the one in the 'Rari
I am the one with the molly
I'm 'bout to catch a body (brrt, brtt, brrt!)
