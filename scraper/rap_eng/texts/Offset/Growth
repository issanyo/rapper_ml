[Intro]
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

[Chorus: Offset]
Money knockin' at my door (money at the door)
Three times in a row (three times)
Yeah she fine but she a hoe (fine she a hoe)
Tell me something I don't know (I already know)
Take my shirt off at the show (pipe up, pipe up)
Fucking dimes in a row (smash, smash)
I'm in New York with D-Rose (New York)
Sometimes you gotta let it go (let it go)
Black phantom that's a crow (Ghost)
I grinded hard for my bros (bros)
Now it's time to have a toast (champagne, yeah)
When I was broke then you went ghost (where, where)

[Verse: Offset]
Offset!
How 'bout the money I'm getting it (how 'bout it)
How 'bout the hoes I'm hittin' (how 'bout it)
How you gonna start and not finish (how?)
Hop in the Rolls, it's tinted (skkrt)
I gotta go in a minute (get it)
I'm about to dive in it (dive)
Taking my time with it (time)
You know that she fine with it (fine)
Yeah she bad but she on go (she on go!)
Turn off the lights and I still glow (I'mma glow)
Don't make me come and wipe your nose (grrrah)
This money got my body froze (hey, froze!)
Whippin and cookin' a whatchamacallit (whippin' and whippin' and cookin' it)
Went to the jeweler then bought me a watch for 40 (went to the jeweler then split it)
I heard you were tellin', working for law and order
Lambo parkin, pick up an 80 in Charlotte (skrrrt, 80)
I know I'm a target, I know I'm a target (bah!)
Had to switch the game up (switch), got the bulletproof Rari (skrrt)
If I fucked your bitch, I didn't mean it, I'm sorry (sorry)
Diamonds on my neck and wrist dancin' like Rick Ricardo (yeah)
I'm reading through the lines (yeah), even on the barcodes (yeah)
I just popped a Xan and I gave that bitch a narco (yeah)
Pull up in Chicago, get the Draco on with the tac on (bah!)
In the valley with a model sniffin' coco
My cash right (right), the good life (good)
I don't want no hood life (no), I'm so right (right)
Left my last bitch (bitch), good night (good night)
Rollie on my wrist (wrist), 41 that's the size (woo)

[Chorus: Offset]
Money knockin' at my door (money at the door)
Three times in a row (three times)
Yeah she fine but she a hoe (fine she a hoe)
Tell me something I don't know (I already know)
Take my shirt off at the show (pipe up, pipe up)
Fucking dimes in a row (smash, smash)
I'm in New York with D-Rose (New York)
Sometimes you gotta let it go (let it go)
Black phantom that's a crow (Ghost)
I grinded hard for my bros (bros)
Now it's time to have a toast (champagne, yeah)
When I was broke then you went ghost (where, where)
