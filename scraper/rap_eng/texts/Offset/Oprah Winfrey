[Intro: Offset]
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Hook: Offset]
Young Rich Nigga worth a million
Maserati, smashin' buildings, Bob the builder
Rich nigga came straight out the trenchez
Fat pocket call it Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey, Oprah Winfrey
Rich nigga like Oprah Winfrey
Oprah Winfrey, Rich nigga like Oprah Winfrey(3x)
(Offset!)
Oprah Winfrey

[Verse 1: Offset]
Pockets is fat like it Oprah Winfrey
Got a million I forgot to mention (M&Ms!)
30 round clip, that's a long extension
YRN then I end a sentence
I was locked up for a little sentence
Then I got out and bought a Bentley
Beat the pot like Bobby did Whitney
Grinch goons comin' through yo' chimney
I know that you mad 'cuz you work at Wendy's
I'm drillin' yo' bitch mouth like I'm a dentist
My shoes  an amphibian, they Givenchy
Don't make my bitch set it off, Jada Pinkett
I step on you niggas like welcome mats
Toni Braxton kush, have a heart attack
I wait on my nigga he comin' back
Fuck 12 nigga, free Willie Mac
I'm makin' a movie like Cinemax
Red diamonds look like a maxi pad
20 thousand make my pants sag
The streets is a jungle, didn't have a dad
I'm paintin' a  picture like Mona Lisa
I gotta a plug up in Indonesia
Giuseppe Zanotti, they hyena
I'm drinkin' lean too much, might have a seizure(lean!)

[Verse 2: Chrissa SJE]
Young rich nigga like Oprah
Hustlin', chasin' payola
In a party, I'm presented sober
Ashton kush blunts on the sofa
Extra he  be the connect
No Nike shoes, used to run up a check
Bus full of sluts like Next
Shuffling hoes, no deck
Mountain blue mountain sippin' on lean, kush and codeine
With blue dream
Fuck you niggas mean, sippin' green lean
Whatchu mean roll up the billie jean
Y'all niggas speakin' brokanese
Nigga get your money up
Just finnesed the plug with a check
You know a young nigga had to run it up
Never had shit but some pot and a (??), came from the trenchez
You know a young nigga runnin' up digits
No need to ask for the ticket
Went from rags to riches to bags of midgets
To baddest of bitches, extravagant living
While you niggas still pretty penny
Gettin' to the Ms like Winfrey

[Verse 3: Domingo & Mango Foo]
(Domingo!)(Mango!)
Rich nigga like Oprah Winfrey
Different color hoes, Mr. Bentley
All about a check, I want the riches
Made it to the top, jumped out the trenchez
(Jumped out the trenchez, no trampoline)
(My team been ballin' like Mr. Clean)
(No steppin', my pockets is Oprah Winfrey)
(Like Terio, my choppas still kickin')
Daffy Duck, Kermit, my bullets spittin'
Migo my gang and we worth a ticket
Makin' movies like my nigga Cricket
Duuh!Duuh!Duuh!Duuh!, add up the digits
(Add up the digits and you niggas penny pinchin')
(In the A with them birds, I'm Mike Vickin')
(Makin' grades on my hustle but no T.I.P)
(I'm stuntin' like Jackie Chan when I kick it)
My diamonds is red like the Bulls
No Scottie Pippen, hunnids spent at Lenox
Got red on the bottom of my shoes
These Loubitons and I am a Christian
(True to my religion, I got plenty money but I'm still stealin')
Migos still winnin', whippin'them babies I hate children
