Fuck it I put a lil' AP up on her lil’ wrist
And I added some glass
Fuck it hoe go get your cousin

Drop off yo' hoe, yeah she know I’m the GOAT
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Muhammed Ali with the stroke
Touchin' your toes, get it in her gut make her fold
Make her put the bricks on the road
Whip it up when it's on the stove
Diving in her legs like splash, smack on her ass
Poppin' on tags, she transportin' gas
