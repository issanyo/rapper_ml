[Made Man]
(Made Man!)
My diamonds they coming from alien
I trapped in the game and I'm nailing it
Jumping in raw fist telling it
Bricks you know we pedal it
All of my niggas sip medicine
Thinking we playing for Michigan
Have my place comin' in, comin' in, M'n'M, M'n'M
Lost it, I got it, I'm back again
20k spent in the mall again
Bigger the bag, the bigger the rich
She's digging my style, I'm fucking your bitch
You know that I'm on, she know that I'm rich
Call on my phone, call on flights bitch I'm gone
Money won't leave my 'lone, hating eyes do ya wrong
Big bag coming home, nigga while on the phone
Young rich nigga on, making nets on the trade
Hundred rounds to your face, nigga been getting cake
Grind on can't waste, copped the house with the lake
Broke niggas can't relate, bad bitches paint their face
Made Man been straight

[Offset]
(Offset!)
Yeah
I am in the trap with the blue Hundreds
Yeah I've been ballin' for three summers
No I can't fold, I don't dishonor
Rocks on my wrist, I got big pointers
Fuck on your bitch tape brick on her
Run with the pack get a hit on ya
Hop in the Wraith and I shit on 'em
I do not respect your big homie
I got more racks than your big homie
Kill TEC it got a dick on it
But it do not got no kick on it
I do not play with the racks
Take off the top and detatch
I brought the multiple bags
I spent me a 30 in Saks
I get a bag, I'm gonna tax it
I'm bringing Gambino right back
I make a play in a taxi
He didn't know the driver was strapped
I run the game from the backseat
I had to see how it was mapped
Made Man we having our way
Yea, we are having our racks

[Hook]
