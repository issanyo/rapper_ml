[Hook: Offset]
I tried to sign a bitch (sign)
You tryna find ya bitch (where)
I'm on the private list (hey)
My diamonds blind ya bitch (shine)
How much does it cost? (how much it cost?)
It cost me a loft (cost me a)
My diamonds be shinin', blindin' (shine)
Even when lights are off (shine)
Bitches conceited, yeah (hey)
And I got sauce and seasoning, yeah (hey)
My diamonds freezing, yeah
Making me cold, anemic, yeah (wooh)
I had to stay focused (hey)
So no, I don't know ya (no)
I pose for a poster (yeah)
To get some exposure (uh)

[Verse 1: Quicktrip]
Pull up in a four dot six
No top on a bitch and we lit
All boss around me, no flex
Keep cash on me, no credit
She gotta suck this dick, she sexy
I'm a real one bitch, don't forget it
Every nigga 'round me getting money
I'm on Bankroll L, not smith street
All my niggas 'round me they so street
I don't deal ass niggas with [?]
And you niggas so-so, no JD
He ain't never sold dope, pack no heat
Man my young niggas bustin' on the back street
They'll do it for the free if you ask me
Nigga tried me last week, got his ass beat
One thing nigga know not to try street
One thing a nigga know not to try me
If you think I'm sweet then ask me
Got a plug on the way, can't tax me
Got real gas nigga, like I'm QT
If you heard the word flex, nigga that's me
He ain't move no packs, you can ask me
I was running through the packs like a track meet
Plug ain't got a phone, had to fax me

[Verse 2: Offset]
Young (young), rich (rich), famous (famous)
When I was up in the trap I stuffed it in her anus (anus)
All these trophies hangin' on my neck like I left a banquet (trophy)
Remember we was fucked up, we was rappin' in the basement (fucked up)
Back to the basics (basic), but I was never basic (no)
Running to the money, I forgot to tie my laces
My pockets full of broccoli, throw the money, watch 'em mop it
I knew I'd have a plug, I was little playin' with the socket
Chopper pocket rocket, paparazzi always watching
I didn't have an option, had to cock it, get the profit
Bitches on my jockey 'cause these diamonds in my watches
Pockets Andy Milonakis, eating on hibachi
