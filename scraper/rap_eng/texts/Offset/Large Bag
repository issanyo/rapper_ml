[Hook: Fly-Ty]
I cut the small talk, I just need all cash
You got the small ones, I need that large bag
I need a large bag (bag)
I need a large bag (bag)
I get a large bag
I get a la-la-large bag

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
No we don't do bottles, unless it's a few cases
Make it mostly D'usse, throw in a few Aces
Might have been better off voting for Trump, at least he a true racist
You know that large bag is what I want, now fill it with blue faces
I'm in that new spaceship, no we don't do fake shit
I got my Cuban on my Sky-Dweller like 2 bracelets
I need a large bag
I got some large plans, try not to rush shit though
I leave it in God's hand
Used to sell hard grams, took it the whole keys
Some niggas got killed other niggas came home parolees (I see it)
I throw up the white flag, tell me why y'all mad (why)
Cos I don't need no time, I need a large bag

[Hook: Fly-Ty]
I cut the small talk, I just need all cash
You got the small ones, I need that large bag
I need a large bag (bag)
I need a large bag (bag)
I get a large bag (bag)
I get a la-la-large bag
You heard that we got it in
Heard that we ship it out
Cash or delivery
I need a la-la-large bag
I need a large bag
I need a large bag (bag)
I need that large bag (bag)
Get to that large bag

[Verse 2: Offset]
I need a bag that's bigger than me
She want a bag and she wants some weed
Better get down and suck me to sleep
Or go on the road with a pound of the keys
Woo woah this shit is not free hoe
I get this money so easily nigga I'm ballin' on niggas like free throws
Tell my shooter check the peephole
Don't-don't get this shit started, diamonds hittin' and they lookin' retarded
Ay, I'm a true artist, and the young nigga gotta keep the guard up
Ay, you niggas is starving
Ay, I'm Marvin the Martian, pull up with lambs and park it
Go to the jeweler on frostbit
Please excuse the shooters, I beat up the pot and I bruise it
We bosses and plus we exclusive, I don't touch but it's still gon' be movin'
I am not with all that cool shit, you had the money, how you lose it?
I bought a mansion and a cruise ship, keep switching my cars like confused

[Hook: Fly-Ty]
I cut the small talk, I just need all cash
You got the small ones, I need that large bag

[Verse 3: Fly-Ty]
I get a large bag
These niggas all mad
They jacking our swag, hit that hoe and don't call back
100 thou in my call log, I'm trying to catch me an M
I'm tryna cop a new Wraith, I finna tray in a benz
Imma bout to fill up the safe, I move a brick in a day
Don't give a fuck bout a hoe, they just be trickin' away
Rollies should not make a sound, yours be ticking away
Quarter-mill on a wrist, I just be flicking away
I got a large bag, Imagine I give it away
These niggas be feeling a way, cos niggas go broke every day
I just be feelin' myself, Balmain's no belt
All strength no weakness, no handouts no help

[Hook: Fly-Ty]
I cut the small talk, I just need all cash
