I'm gettin' new paper over here
Gettin' brand new paper over here
I'm gettin' new paper over here
Gettin' brand new paper over here

[Verse]
All this money comin' in my way
Fuck what a hater even got to say (Fuck 'em)
Me, myself, and I cruise down the highway
Pull up to the bank I walk right out with a 100K (Cash, uh)
New money, blue hundreds, no I ain't runnin' from it (New money)
Got foreign currency from doin' shows across the country (foreign)
'Case an emergency I got some more money stashed
Wish my niggas seen how far we came it make me sad (R.I.P. Damn)
Money make a nigga happy but some niggas mad at me (Mad at me)
Hoes callin' me the dab daddy, trend set the fashion (Dab daddy)
New money comin' in every day, that's a satisfaction (Uh)
This is the answer to what you keep askin' (Huh)

Gettin' brand new paper over here
I'm gettin' new paper over here
Gettin' brand new paper over here
I'm gettin' new paper over here
Gettin' brand new paper over here
