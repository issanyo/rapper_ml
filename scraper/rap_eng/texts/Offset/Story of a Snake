[Intro]
I see about time I need to cut my grass real real real low
Too many snakes in my grass, I don't, I don't, I don't fuck with that

[Hook]
Gotta keep my glass cut low for them snakes
Gotta keep my glass low for them snakes
Fuck a bitch never cared about a bitch forgive me lord
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my glass low for them snakes
Them motherfucking snakes, them motherfucking snakes
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Yo grass tall you can't see no mo
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Low low low

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you bout snakes
Had connects from overseas shipping work from oversea
Had a daughter, and a son, and a wife named Marie
Baddest bitch I ever seen, ass fat as Cherokee
George partner named Michael knew him since he was in diapers
They been getting money for years
Juugin', selling Betty Crocker
Just one night George leave hit a lick for a millie
Michael laughing grinning with him
George don't know Mike thinking about hitting him
In five minutes he gon' be dozin' off he gon be slippin' as fuck
Michael did a line to snort
George eyes shut
Michael slipped something in George's cup
That fucked his memory up
Gotta keep my grass cut low for them snakes
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Yo grass tall you can't see no mo
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Low low low


[Hook]
Gotta keep my glass cut low for them snakes
Gotta keep my glass low for them snakes
Fuck a bitch never cared about a bitch forgive me lord
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my glass low for them snakes
Them motherfucking snakes, them motherfucking snakes
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Yo grass tall you can't see no mo
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Low low low

[Verse 2]

[Hook]
Gotta keep my glass cut low for them snakes
Gotta keep my glass low for them snakes
Fuck a bitch never cared about a bitch forgive me lord
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes

Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Yo grass tall you can't see no mo
