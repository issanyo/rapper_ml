[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
I told her
The dick wake you up just like Folgers
I like my hoes a little bit older
And she got nasty when her friend came over
Hold on, you know I’m a beast
Jewelry selection, got piece after piece
Pay double rent just to break out the lease
OG gave me way more game than I could teach
You shop at Ross, I’m not talking Diana
Every day Christmas, I been had met Santa
Prices was off when I moved to Atlanta
Want two in Givenchy, the vert Tropicana
Getting money is addicting
Rocket in my pocket even when a nigga sitting
Babe Ruth chopper like I play nine innings
These bitches ain’t loyal, they all need some fixing
I’ma tell you ‘bout the North
I’ma tell you ‘bout my loss
Every real nigga done took a loss
Top floor but I won’t tell the cops
Young rich nigga in the young rich nation
Flippa will flip shit, no hesitation
Tonight me and you is the situation
My time is gon’ come, I’m just being patient

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
I’m tellin’ ya
I done smoked too many bags of cookie
I’m tellin’ ya
If your club dabbing, tell promoters book me
I’m tellin’ ya
I’m a smooth killer but don’t push me
I’m tellin’ ya
Freshman of the year but I’m no rookie
I’m tellin’ ya
Have you ever counted 100 grand?
I’m tellin’ ya
Used to see me dab on demand
I’m tellin’ ya
The paper should take over all your plans
I’m tellin’ ya
Rich niggas own they own land

[Verse 2: Offset & Quavo]
Offset!
I’m tellin’ ya
That cap that you talkin’ irrelevant
That cookie you sellin’, ain’t smelling it
I’m tellin’ ya (Quavo)
I hit the plug for the medicine
Shoot a nigga, day of reckoning
Birds flying like a pelican
We finesse a nigga, doing excellent
I’m serving the birds and givin’ ‘em dressin-ing
Boy take that shit over there, I’m tellin’ ya
Cause we don’t shoot in the air, I’m tellin’ ya
Little bitty bitch want to snap
We taking her phone ‘cause she usin’ every app
I’m tellin’ ya
500 thousand on craps
Watch where you sit, it’s a stick in that couch
I’m tellin’ ya
We brought the dab to the trap
You think that I’m lying
Had 200 thousand, fuck rap
I had a 44, tiptoe through your backdoor
Give niggas the flow that they didn’t even ask for
You talk to the feds, boy you know that’s a no-no
They knock on my door, I don’t open if I don’t know
Razzle dazzle, took your hoo out the shackles
If you want the dab, here go you a raffle
You runnin’ off with it, the chopper gon’ tackle
Perform in Wisconsin like a Green Bay Packer

[Hook: Skippa Da Flippa]
I’m tellin’ ya
I done smoked too many bags of cookie

If your club dabbing, tell promoters book me
I’m tellin’ ya
I’m a smooth killer but don’t push me

Freshman of the year but I’m no rookie
I’m tellin’ ya

I’m tellin’ ya
