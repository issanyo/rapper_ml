[Intro: Offset]
That boy Cassius
N-n-nonstop
Hey!

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas (dud)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Diamonds on me, what's the price? (price)
I'm not gettin' involved with the hype (hype)
I'm too rich to get into a fight (too rich)
Fifty racks got my jeans fittin' tight (fifty racks)
Pay the price and them boys come and wipe you
We had to dispose of the diaper (dispose)
Yeah we trap every week, every night (whoa)
Work my move, we too smooth, no indictments (hey)
Yeah, Freakazoid lightnin' (lightnin')
57 90 and it's bitin' (bite)
When I seen a mil I got excited (million)
For the cash I'ma turn to Michael Myers
Baguettes keep dripping, droppin' (drip)
My wrist all liquid watches (watch)
Told the bitch jump on my dick and pop it, ooh
Gave a little bitch a deposit
Cross on my neck, strap boxin', uh
Cup full of Tech, it's toxic
Draw down the SIG, chop chop chop 'em
Yeah, you dig, your bitch is an option
Put that watch in the fridge 'cause it's drippin', gettin' sloppy
When it's too much traffic gotta get a helicopter
Bentley Bentayga, no shoes on my carpet
No Vince Carter, fifteen with the carbon

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas (dud)

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Floral shit, stay in Gucci from the forest
Lean in my organs, walkin' on your mortgage
I got some jewelry, it cost me a fortune
Got a little freaky bitch and she gorgeous
Balmain sag on the Saint Laurent
I'm pourin' up that it's the time of the month
Diamonds hittin' like a Mortal Kombat punch
Servin' that cool, same color Nestle Crunch
Stackin' them hundreds up, I got a bunch
I can't tell the time, my dial done bust
Stay with that Glock, nigga know who I trust
Still in the trap, nigga servin' that raw dust
Come get your ho ,'cause you know she wan' fuck
Designer drugs serve like I'm wearin' a Gucci tux
Ride two cars back to back when I'm re-ing up
I'm on them percs, chasin' like I was on Tuss
Givenchy, gelato when I'm rollin' up
Me and Offset strapped up in the Bentley truck
Ooh, she suck it good, make it touch and bust
Too bad that lil bitch couldn't make the cut
I came in drippin', drippin' in designer
I got an ese, not an assignment
Too many chains on, my bitch start whining
Diamonds big rock like I'm mountain climbing

[Chorus: Offset]
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Came through drippin' (drip drip)
Diamonds on my wrist, they drippin' (ice)
Bitch you a thot, ain't trickin' (thot, thot)
Put her on her knee, make her lick it (lick it)
Patek on my wrist, and it's glistenin' (drip, drip)
The bitch got mad, I dissed her (hey)
Shawty, you ain't nothin' to a rich nigga (nothin')
I'll put a check on a bitch nigga (brrt)
Fuck your whole set and your clique, nigga (fuck 'em)
Got a gang full of dud and some broke niggas (dud)
