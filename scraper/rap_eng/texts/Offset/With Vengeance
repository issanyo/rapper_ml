[Intro: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Hey, hey
Drank
Yuh, ooh

[Verse 1: Ski Mask The Slump God]
Yo' bitch gon' catch my balls just like a goalie, whoadie
We at hotel just like Zack & Cody
Pockets look pregnant or maybe just bloated
My pockets look nosy, Pinocchio pokin'
Her pussy hocus, I'm a pocus
My heart December, it's the coldest
Attract a kitty, just like litter
Then I turn her face into a babysitter
Diamonds like fingers, watch it flicker
Snake venom vocals, flow got sicker
Sharper than sabers made straight from Darth Vader
Yo' bitch on my hotdog, Oscar Mayer wiener
I can't stand the sight of swine
They can't touch a nigga like a porcupine
Dance up in that pussy, I electric slide
Then she put her hands up like I just asked for a high five
Because, besides, I'm high
As much as a knot in a tie
I shoo yo' bitch 'way like a fly
I don't got theâ€”

[Chorus: Ski Mask The Slump God & Offset]
This is my revenge
With vengeance, with vengeance
With vengeance (hey)
With vengeance
With vengeance (hooh, hooh)

[Verse 2: Offset]
.45 with a extension, better panic (brr-brr)
It's a ransom, so we trappin' out the Phantom (ransom)
Diamonds dancin', I shoot him on a Banshee
Hype, bitch, I'ma fuck you and your man up (hype, bitch)
I done feel like niggas takin' my chemicals (hooh)
VVS diamonds, baby, look at the minerals (hey)
Put my dick up in your mouth and play with the genitals (ayy)
Foul on the play, we pull the chopper for penalties (pow)
Yeah, I had to get the lamb, fuck the verdict, converted (low)
Nigga, go to war like the Persian (brr, brr)
I'm havin' water and these bitches thirsty, slurp (splash)
I make her drink a gallon of the Gerbers
I put the skully on my wrist, ice chilly on my wrist (ice)
DMX, bitch, I go Belly on a bitch
Margielly on my bitch, R. Kelly on my wrist
I'm a lunatic, but Nelly ain't on this type of shit (nah)
Wow, turnin' into a maniac (wow)
Yeah, the diamond give a heart attack (drip)
We get to poppin', turn a nigga into a runnin' back (brr, brr)
Ran off from the plug, that nigga showed me about a hunnid' racks
I was in a maze, in the bando trap (maze)
When the coke come glazed, gotta cut the crack (glazed)
You can see it in my face, I got rack, racks (ooh)
Mansion acre with the gate, that's a fact, Jack (fact)
You got caught up in the wave, you got left back (ayy)
My niggas pull up with the dra', they got hellcat (hey)
