[Hook: Quavo]
You can catch me ridin' in that foreign thang
Foreign bad bitch, I can't e'en pronounce her name
Talkin' numbers on the phone while I'm getting brain
Switch four lanes, I'm in my own lane
You can catch me ridin' in that foreign thang
Foreign bad bitch, I can't e'en pronounce her name
Talkin' numbers on the phone while I'm getting brain
Switch four lanes, I'm in my own lane

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Listen up nigga when a real boss speak
We the hottest young nigga step off in the streets
Migo Gang, Migo Gang yeah we keep the heat
D.U.I Lebron James yeah we keep the heat
If you talking paper then we got a lot of sheets
I got so much tattoos it look like I took all the ink
I throw the money in the air it go a hundred feet
I throw the money in the air it go a hundred feet
If you tryna murd' my team then you gonna sleep
Rock-a-bye baby put a pussy nigga to sleep
If you tryna flex my team

You can catch me ridin' in that foriegn thang
With a bad bitch come from Italy I don't even know her name
Spend 5 hundred thousand just to throw off with my chain
S-s-switch lane while I'm sleepin on that brain
While in the Maybach Imma need about 4 lane
Work on my back, Imma need about 2 canes
Throwin' old hunnas on [?] like the old day
Black and white chevy like it was the old day
Switch lane in my foreign thang
Bad bitch with me I can't even pronounce her name

No I'm not your Money baby
But I got your money baby

[Verse 3: Offset]
All my bitches foreign all your bitches looking boring
Wake up in the morning take 2 zips an now I'm pouring
I'm in my own lane with tha 'rari thang
Pushin tha gas', I will leave your ass
Total vision all I see is cash

Foreign bitch, foreign 2-door
Smoke the Keyshia Cole
We don't sell no more
Too many racks in my motherfuckin 'raris
Watch out for them snakes
You know them boys always been coppin
Fifty bands up in [?] just for me to [?]
Another 10 in the club
Somebody bring some mopping
