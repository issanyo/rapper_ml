[Intro: Mango Foo]
We got the streets on lock
We ain't got the time to go back and forth with you niggas
Just another day on the block
You know what I mean?
Real nawf shit

[Verse 1: Mango Foo]
Young rich nigga still riding in the Bentley
Got the .22 on me just like I'm [?]
All my niggas killers, I put them up on a mission
Bitch I'm in the hood, ain't talking that [?]
Young rich nigga, all my nigga worth a ticket
Keep the Smithen Western, Ain't talking 'bout [?]
No Meek I'm in Philly, I'm tryna come up on a milli
Got the birds from Houston, I got them singing like they Whitney
You want you a brick, call up Diablo
In the kitchen, Rock up the old just like I'm Rocko
You would not be trusting these hoes if you know what I know
I got a rocketed powered on me, don't call me auto
My plug he got the brick, wrap it up like a burrito
I be in the bando late night shooting ceelo
Extendo with the chopper, i'm gonna smoke him like zeebo
Bitch I got money just like the lotto
Panamera came with faugi auto

[Verse 2: Offset]
Pulling out the stick and it's an auto
Fucking on your bitch, she suck and swallow
Hit 'em with the FN with hollows
Got a migo plug, get the chicken from a vato
All you nigga doubted now i'm talking to my pilot
Smoking on the cookie while I'm driving in my Mozzi
Pull up in the lamb, I cut the top off, Samurai it
Gas bag in the bando, nigga come and try it
Had to spend a hundred thousand cash on my lawyer
Bitches in the kitchen whipping like [?]
I know these old niggas mad fucking on their daughters
Welcome to the bando, pussy nigga get extorted
Don't trust a nigga trap cause a nigga might short ya
Babies in the kitchen cause i'm not gon' abort them
My niggas need me, I'ma support them
I won't leave them hanging like orphan
Get up out my way, A hundred thousand on my plate
I told that bitch I'ma nut on your face
I'm smoking on that cookie from the bay
I'm running to that money, I'm in shape
Smoking on gas while I pour up an eighth
Sipping on lean to the face
I had a dream of a wrath, then I went and bought me the wrath

[Verse 3: Migo Domingo]
Pull up fire in the wrath
Young rich nigga half a mill in my safe
Come from the north where you know you ain't safe
[?] put the chop in your face
[?] gonna need first place
Every time I eat, know I gotta say my grace
Hit 'em with the 30, god damn it the case
Blue Benjamins only thing a nigga taste
Meet the plug, run it up, stack it, gotta flip it
Say you got the bricks for the low, what's a ticket
You say you smoke gas but a nigga smell midget
Beat on the block tryna jump like you're a cricket
Hundred round drum shot a movie like [?]
Balling on these niggas [?] pendant
Everybody eating on my team thanksgiving
YRN Label that's how a nigga living
