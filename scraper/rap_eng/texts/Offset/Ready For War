[Intro: Offset]
Whatever you with we with it

[Hook: Offset]
300 deep like the Romans
Knocking off any opponent
See a lot of niggas cloning
Migo my gang and we own it
72 what they offer
Birds swimming like a dolphin
GD be the reason I'm bossing
Sipping activ like I'm coughing
Ready for war
Ready for war
If you with it nigga we with it
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
If you with it nigga then we with it
Ready for war
Ready for war

[Verse 1: Offset]
I see you niggas plottin' tryna leave me rotten
Cooking up the dope I'm sneezing like it's pollen
Pocket watching tryna watch a nigga wallet
(Wee-ooh wee-ooh wee-ooh wooo)
The ambulance sirens
Somebody caught a body bullets burn a nigga like it's niacin
Ready for war like a [?]
Got the game in a lock like the figure-four
No Terio but I killed them though
I'm looking at you niggas through the scope
Oh shit there he go
Caught me slipping walking with my hoe
[?] hundred thousand more
Call me Curtis blow cause I got hella snow
You the weak link so the chain broke
Bullets burning your throat like your chain smoke
I'm a fool with the pistol like Django
Kill you face to face like it is tango
You with it we with it we pull up extension the hardest niggas start to flip it
Not to mention; I got the trap and it filled with infants

[Hook: Offset]
300 deep like the Romans
Knocking off any opponent
See a lot of niggas cloning
Migo my gang and we own it
72 what they offer
Birds swimming like a dolphin
GD be the reason I'm bossing
Sipping activ like I'm coughing
Ready for war
Ready for war
If you with it nigga we with it
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
Ready for war
If you with it nigga then we with it
Ready for war
Ready for war

[Verse 2: Domingo]
We 300 deep like the Spartans
All of my niggas are arsons
That mean they fire a nigga up
Won't nothing be left for the coffin
Leave his ass wet like a dolphin
Fuck with the gang then we offing
Keep thinking I'm a lick nigga
It's a massacre like we in Boston
Ready for war niggas on go
The youngin's gon shoot
Put it more work I walk on the nawf
They know to salute
My killers they geeking on boot
Go get em' and do what you do
All they want is the money
They don't even care who they shoot
You with it we with it all of my niggas pull up with extensions we straight from the trenches
Niggas and bitches they know that we shooters they never play with us
Counting up digits I'm chasing my money
After the hundreds I'm chasing my racks
Fuck niggas want war you don't want that
Cause we

[Hook: Offset]
300 deep like the Romans

If you with it nigga then we with it
Ready for war
