[Chorus: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out
Doin' what they can't 'cause it's deadlock
4 until 4, almost fell out
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out

[Verse 1: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, almost fell out
How did I know you would sell out?
I hit the block and I sellout
Plug in LA, put the mail out
Niggas be waitin' for handouts
I roll the blunts size of dreadlocks
Most of my sneakers is dead-stock
I fuck the bitch 'til the bed rocks
I will not sell from the crib though
No service there like a dead spot
I don't eat pig 'cause I smell cop
I been this way since the sandbox
And I must live where I cannot
Impossible? Why the hell not?
I'm more lucky than shamrock
All my dogs cold, and the lead hot

[Chorus: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out
Doin' what they can't 'cause it's deadlock
4 until 4, almost fell out
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out

[Verse 2: Offset]
Bad bitches walkin' on some red bottoms
Countin' up the racks, I be playin' with 'em
Iced out Patek, hundred thou' on my arm
Got yo' bitch on the run, yeah she callin' me the Don
The Actavis, it got a nigga in a headlock
Flintstone diamonds, make these bitches bed rock
Hoppin' in the coupe, drop top, robot
Everybody gotta stick, ain't no Glocks
Just popped the perc, I ain't fuckin' with the xan
Yeah, shawty bad but lil' mama a fan
I'm the engine that told you I can
Big bank take lil' bank, the battle of bands
Heart of a lion, I ain't scared of these niggas
Hoppin' in that lamb, switch gears on these niggas
Heat tryna kill, put a tear on a nigga
He dead and gone nigga, pour a beer for your nigga

[Chorus: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out
Doin' what they can't 'cause it's deadlock
4 until 4, almost fell out
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out

[Verse 3: Cousin Stizz]
These days I run it like Ricky, I'm Ross
What does it take, turn yourself to a boss
I'm getting oral, B, you know I floss
Straight to the bread at all costs
Those diamonds ain't real, boy, so knock it off
Hittin' the 4 'til I'm noddin' off
Smokin' the gas with the CVs and rastas
Just spent $100 on one plate of pasta
Green and the red I'm like Blanca
Play with the team, turn to Contra
Rollie in water like lobster
Me and three bitches in Benihana
I ain't their daddy, they call me papa
Hundred bands come up of fifty dollars
Watch out for snakes like a Gucci collar

[Chorus: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out
Doin' what they can't 'cause it's deadlock
4 until 4, almost fell out
Yeah, I put the drank in the headlock
Tryna cross me, boy? You better not
4 until 4, almost fell out

[Outro: Cousin Stizz]
I put the drank in a headlock
I-I put the drank in a headlock
