[Intro]
Can't go out there playin' when you see us young rich niggas
Droppin' straight cash on whips, flooded ice
I know you like, "How the fuck these niggas got so much drip?"
Hundred thousand dollar watches
Three point five million dollar cribs and shit
Check the Forbes list, nigga

[Chorus: Offset]
I'm in the coupe, fo' sho (skrr)
Candy coat (candy)
Maison Margiela my coat (Maison)
I'm on froze (I'm on ice)
Put a lil bitch on the cold (woo)
Anna Nicole (Anna Nicole)
Everything glitter ain't gold (gold)
You're gettin' exposed (you gettin' exposed)
Hop in the frog and leap (leap)
Patek Philippe (Patek Philippe)
Servin' them dummy bricks (brick)
I get them for cheap (I got 'em for low)
Hop in the Wraith and I creep (skrr)
Massage the seats (massage the seats)
I got the racks in the brief (racks)
Bosses don't speak (nah)

Oh yeah, my wrist cost a hundred (hundred)
Hundreds on hundreds on hundreds (hundreds)

Put the dope in your hand, want the money on the first (yeah)
I got a bag of the 'lato, the cookie, the sherbert (bag)
It's a murder on the Nawf and they try to put me in the verdict
I got the birdies, ballin' like Julius Erving (brrt)
Cookin' it early, dope get to singin' like Shirley
Got thirties on thirties, we callin' them thirties Steph Curry
Don't talk to me dirty 'cause my niggas goin' seven thirty
Gave her the pink molly, told a bitch yeah it's Kirby (molly)
I'ma just fuck her three times and then I'ma curve it (smash, smash)
Oh my God, she said her feelings is hurtin' (oh my God, woah)
Shut the fuck up lil' thotty, suck it and slurp it (shh, shh, ehh)
Where was everybody when I was just hurtin'? (where, where)
