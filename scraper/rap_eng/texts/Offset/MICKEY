[Intro]
30, you a fool for this one

[Verse 1: Offset & Lil Yachty]
Trappin' out the back street
Runnin' through the packs like a track meet (zoom!)
Pull up with two pistols on me, Max P
Back to back the Bentley truck, we on repeat
Drippin' on these bitches, put a stain on 'em
Lamborghini Aventador, no brain on it
Iced out Patek with the rain on it
Automatic with the scope, range on it

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Spent 160, that's on two watches (two watches)
God damn, think I need a new hobby (new hobby)
Bought a chain, coulda bought a Bugatti (Bugatti)
Niggas dick ridin' with a Ducati (Ducati)
Check it out, check it out, check it out (hoo)
Ridin' 'round town with the sticks out (hoo)
It's fashion week, so I bought the Rick's out (hoo)
These niggas rats, no Mickey Mouse

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
(Yeah)
These niggas hatin' 'cause I'm too rich (too rich)
Big carats, same size Cheez-Its (Cheez-Its)
88 thou' for a new wrist (whoo)
Peter Piper, pull up with a new pistol (pew, pew)
Those not diamonds, those crystals
Runnin' to the money like I'm Frank Gore (yuh)
This ring cost more than a Honda 'Cord (skrt)
Fuck with the set then it's over with (over with)
Walk in the spot, get it overlit (overlit)
I want some pussy, she open it (open it)
Fuck her one time then I'm over it (over it)
These niggas weird and they talk too much (yuh)
All these new niggas, they socialists (yuh)
Holdin' on tight to my braggin' rights
I write my name on the mogul list

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Spent 160, that's on two watches (two watches)
God damn, think I need a new hobby (new hobby)
Bought a chain, coulda bought a Bugatti (Bugatti)
Niggas dick ridin' with a Ducati (Ducati)
Check it out, check it out, check it out (hoo)
Ridin' 'round town with the sticks out (hoo)
It's fashion week, so I bought the Rick's out (hoo)
These niggas rats, no Mickey Mouse (gang)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Million dollar lick but I missed out (missed out)
Had to sleep on the drank, I was pissed off (pissed off)
Got 100 on your hand, hold your wrist out (wrist out)
Hellcat racecar, no pitstop (no pitstop)
Had a million dollars cash at my bitch house (bitch house)
Wearin' 20 thousand dollar outfits now (outfits)
Coupe cost 160 and I cashed out (cash)
Lil' Steve comin' home, 'bout to max out
Anything I buy, I'm spendin' all 20s
100s and 50s goin' to the grave wit' me (yeah)
I sleep with a chopper and bathe with a glizzy
A nigga try Yachty, we shootin' up the city (frraah)
Ask them other niggas how we got busy (how we got busy)
It ain't no sleep 'til we hittin' the victim (hittin' our victim)
Nigga play gangster, but we know they bitches (we know they bitches)
I'm thinkin' they mad 'cause we fuckin' they bitches

[Chorus: Lil Yachty]
Spent 160, that's on two watches (two watches)
God damn, think I need a new hobby (new hobby)
Bought a chain, coulda bought a Bugatti (Bugatti)
Niggas dick ridin' with a Ducati (Ducati)
Check it out, check it out, check it out (hoo)
Ridin' 'round town with the sticks out (hoo)
It's fashion week, so I bought the Rick's out (hoo)
These niggas rats, no Mickey Mouse (gang)
