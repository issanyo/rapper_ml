Oh, damn, hoo

[Chorus: OG Maco]
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket

[Verse 1: Offset]
Pull up in the Bentley just to visit
I'm talkin' grown man business
I was hungry 'til I got a meal ticket
When you got a milly promise you feel different
Beatin' the pot like an instrumental
Locked up in the cage and it made me mental
Paid a ticket to my lawyer, not taking no fee
'Cause money made the jury say I'm not guilty
Pay my young nigga and now you a victim
Fifty cal with the scope, I cannot miss you
You in the wrong neighborhood, Longway get him
Cookin' up fish in the pot, no gefilte
Two hundred thousand, make two hundred million
I'm too hard to kill and I must be a villian
Oxycontin, percocet and I'm feeling it
When you start a foundation you gotta keep building it
I see that you watching, you copy, you mimic it
I'm an animal, I can survive in the wilderness
My money jumping, flipping like a gymnasium
The diamonds on my wrist is lookin' like Hanukkah

[Chorus: OG Maco]
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket, ticket

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Damn, OG Mac (Ticket)
Them youngins, bustin' so they got no control
Who the 16, same number buy this thirty round, wash on it
Act a fool with the forties
Beams of lights on the gadgets
He don't worth an orgy, couple vices he afford them
With his Rollie stones
'Cause when it's drought time we busting domes
Accurate, sell this shit for a ten, I can even get your friends hit
Plead the fifth, I don't know shit, you can call my lawyer
And if it go back we go cross the border
Don't take on no number just call me one
Ahora mismo how we need the funds
May god forgive me all the shit I done, yeah yeah

[Chorus: OG Maco]
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket
You can get gone for a light ticket
The police flashing lights, hope it's just a ticket
An open homicide for the right ticket
Thirty leave 'em ticking, twitching from 'em, ticket
Ticket, ticket, ticket
