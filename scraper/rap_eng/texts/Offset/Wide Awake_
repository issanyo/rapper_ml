[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1: Offset]
Watchin' my pinky like 200k
Gettin' cooler and cooler get put in your face
My watch was 100 but you get it cheaper
Nigga then why you ain't buy it (buy it)
Bought an all black lambo called jeeper creepers
Inside it's white its like cottage
I hit the gas, keep movin' (?)
I heard she trappin' lootin (she trap)
We got the bags to move it
We got all this cash, got these plaques to prove it (racks)
What's in the bag, the ruler (bow)
We moving too fast, we shoot 'em (br-r-r-r)
Cookie blunt smell like the sewage (cookie blunt)
I wish a nigga would (I wish)
Hang him out the window like Suge (Suge Knight)
Can we go live, Jimmy Kimmel (live)
No lies, we gave you the culture (no lie)
They watched and turned to some vultures (they watch)
I'm wise, I play the game poker (I'm wise)
They laughed they thought it was over (it's over)
Then we kick down the door with the polar (bop)
We came from the trap, hold the bowl up (aye)

[Hook: Quavo]
Just look wide awake (yeah)
When we count up this cake (this cake)
On time is not my taste (my taste)
Nigga might pull up late (late)
Just look wide awake (wake up)
Take yo bae on a date (your bae)
Watch these niggas gonna shade (shade)
Watch these niggas gonna shade (throw shade)
Just look wide awake (aye)
No they can't sleep on me (no sleep)
No they can't sleep on me (no sleep)
No they can't sleep on me (no)
Just look wide awake (wake up)
No they can't sleep on me
