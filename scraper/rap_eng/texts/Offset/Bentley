[Intro: Quavo]
Mmmmm, mmmmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aye

[Hook: Quavo]
Pull up and park the Bentley, pull up and park the Bentley
Pull up on all the bitches, pull up on all the bitches
Neck, it cost a 50, neck, it cost a 50
Niggas just start, we finish it, niggas just start, we finish it
Got some niggas outside waiting on payroll
When he see the green light, he gon' lay on em
Hell yeah, I told the plug to put that weight on me
Hop out with that blue cheese, having that cake on me (Offset!)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Pull up she snortin the Whitney, droppin' the foreign assemblies
We fuck and record the women so they can extort the pimpin'
Pull up and explode with the chickens, I put your ho on the mission
I'm selling white like Iggy, I pay the price for your 'fiddy
The foreign exhaust keep shitting, I'ma big boss in the Bentley
I know what it cost to get millies, you get up and you pipe up your city
I'm from the nawf, whippin' cocaine in a bowl
We havin 'em pass by the low and the price lower than low

[Hook: Quavo]
Pull up and park the Bentley, pull up and park the Bentley
Pull up on all the bitches, pull up on all the bitches
Neck, it cost a 50, neck, it cost a 50
Niggas just start, we finish it, niggas just start, we finish it
Got some niggas outside waiting on payroll
When he see the green light, he gon' lay on em
Hell yeah, I told the plug to put that weight on me
Hop out with that blue cheese, having that cake on me

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I send some niggas to wait on it (Wait on it)
Tempurpedic, they gone lay on it
Margiela sneaker with the paint on it
OG gas bag with the stank on it
Migo gang and some core intels in the Dicky suit with the shank on it
Plotting on me tryna rob me, I advise you otherwise, better think on it
Pullin' up back to back Bentleys, the clip is extended, the windows is tinted
Double up on me, no fended we winning, I drink a whole pint just to fuck up my kidney
I am the realest, I count up a milli, the flow we invented, they scared to admit it
I'ma do it all for the riches, tryna get my niggas all out the trenches
(Takeoff)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Hey, I see a hundred racks all in my way (cash!)
Hey, I said I had to stash a million in my safe (m&m)
Aye, Black and white diamonds, not racists (no, aye)
Aye, I bought a coupe, just to race it (coupe, skrrt)
Aye, I fuck your bitch, but she can't stay with me (aye, aye)
Aye, I bought a mansion, just to lay in it, aye (mansion, ooh)

[Hook: Quavo]
Pull up and park the Bentley, pull up and park the Bentley
Pull up on all the bitches, pull up on all the bitches
Neck, it cost a 50, neck, it cost a 50
Niggas just start, we finish it, niggas just start, we finish it
