(Intro):
Hey, hey I need some more...Hey, I need some more

(Chorus):
Preachin' to these bitches like I'm Don Juan (Don, preach)
I took yo' bitch right out ya hand, that's a strong arm (Ugh, c'mon)
I got that strong cookie in my lungs, got me chi-chi chong (Ching chong)
If you fuck with me like you say, then have my back when I'm right or wrong (Aye!)
Don't let yo' mind go (Ohh, go), the money and the fame might come take your soul (Fame, whoo)
I told my niggas I would never switch up and I put that on my soul (I told em, ugh!)
My wrist is on froze, yo' bitch on all 4's, suckin' dick on the low (Ughh, ughh)
I keep goin' up, it's not enough, I need some mo'

(Verse):
(Aye, Offset) I'm pouring 4's to let the pain go (Pain), I just heard somethin' crazy bout my main hoe (My main)
These old rapper's careers goin' down like drain, ohh (Down)
I'm still blowin' up like a volcano (Aye!)
She bad but she a freak tho (Freak), how you ballin? Missed the freethrow (How?)
You fell off like Tim Tebow (Fell), they thought we had a cheat code (Cheat)
Cock it back and I reload (Bow!), before I check the peep hole (Woah)
My young niggas they stay on (Go!), got sticks under they peacoat (Go! Grrraw)
Aye, it's a cold case (Cold!), murda' last night, ain't got no face (Bow, bow!)
Aye, hey! I stay out the way (Move!) I just hit a juug for a hunnid K (Ugh!)

(Chorus):
Preachin' to these bitches like I'm Don Juan (Don!)
I took yo' bitch right out ya hand, that's a strong arm (Ugh!)
I got that strong cookie in my lungs, got me chi-chi chong (Ching chong)
If you fuck with me like you say, then have my back when I'm right or wrong (Aye!)
Don't let yo' mind go (Go!), the money and the fame might come take your soul (Fame!)
I told my niggas I would never switch up and I put that on my soul (I told em!)
My wrist is on froze, yo' bitch on all 4's, suckin' dick on the low (Ughh!)
