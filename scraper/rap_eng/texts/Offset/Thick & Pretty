[Chorus: Quavo]
Like my women (like what?)
Thick and pretty (pretty and thick)
Like my money (woo)
Hundreds and fifties (hundreds and cash)
Thick and pretty (thick and pretty)
Money and bad bitches (bad)

Or get in between (those titties)
Hundreds and fifties (fifties)
Bitches with titties (bitches with titties)
Count my green (my green)
Or get in between (those titties)
I like my women (bad)
Thick and pretty (pretty, pretty)

Hundreds and fifties (uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Alexander McQueen, Chanel my jeans (Chanel)
Fifty beans, that's for the queen (mama)
This armored team, come with armored things
Might think it's 4 AM in the morning the way it rings, yeah
Wake up and count up the green
Wake up with bad bitches in between
I got on so many chains
I walk around tryna break my spleen (uh)
My bitch so bad, my bitch so bad she walk around bein' mean
I fire up a blunt
I know you ain't real because the cookie made you sneeze (achoo)
I thought you were tougher than that (damn)
But anyway, back to the racks (hey)
I gotta count up the cash
Before I go out and go bring a bitch back (ooh)
Remember they laughed and laughed at the craft and now we gettin' to the plaques (uh)
Fuck 'em, we shoot with the Gat
Young niggas ain't got to cap about that

[Verse 2: Offset]
(Woo, woo, Offset)
Benjamin kin to me (Benjamin kin to me)

Hit her on the Bentley seat (smash, smash)
I gave her every inch of me
You don't believe it
You better call Ripley's
We done achieved it
Mansions, big properties (mansion, woo woo)
Nawfside niggas will bury you
Stuffin' a brick in her derriere
Offset, I am a maniac
An alien, not from this area (alien)
How could I ever be scared of you? (how?)
You just a little bull terrier
Call your bitch sugar, she diggin' the boogers
I'm fuckin' that thot in a Marriott (thot)
I'm smokin' on pot, bring Harry out
She sexy, I'm 'bout to buy her out
She know when it's cap, she call it out (cap)
She know that my pockets on juggernaut
Better not cross that boundary
Look at these frames, these Master P (frames)
Turn a bad bitch to a masterpiece (bad)
Watch out for the devil, tryna tackle me

Like Chester (cash), like Chester (money)
I like a bitch that don't want no attention
Bad bitches the convo, her name get mentioned (bad)
I'm tryna get in between like the white that's inside of them Oreos
Oh, what a feeling (oh)
Pickin up backends from city to city (backends)
I throw a stack and I pick up that bottle
I'm drinkin' it raw like I'm sippin' her titty (codeine)
Then I drop the dope in the skillet (straight drop)
I done ran up me a milly (ran it up)
Count it up, one Mississippi (Count it up)
Two Missi, three Mississippi
I'm trippin', can't tell what my business
You take from the gang, we make you a stain
We gon' have to erase your name (erasin' you)
Ain't changin' up shit, 'cause that's how I came
I'm walkin' out without a stain (fuck 'em)
