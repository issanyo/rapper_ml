[Intro: Takeoff]
You know
You woke up and you don’t know what to do
And you a little hungry
Rap snacks with a dab of ranch
It’s just for you

[Hook: Quavo]
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
We can make it happen
Get your rap snacks
We can make it snappin'
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
We can make it happen
Get your rap snacks
We can make it snappin'
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch

[Verse 1: Quavo & Takeoff]
Quavo
Money like bags of chips
Hunnits of bags I flip
Finger-licking with the ranch
Leaving crumbs on your lips
Truckload backin' up (beep)
New shipment, gotta stack 'em up (Takeoff)
Bag look magical
Mmm, mmm, mmm, good they smackable
Number one record, the chip breaking record so add it up
Trappin' 'em out the gas stations
Customers, customers lined up
I heard that you hungry and you make your mind up
Don't grab a Snickers and go get a bag of 'em
Bag of what? Dab of Ranch
What's with the ranch?, just a lil dab
Just give me a bag (Get me some)
'cause I'm bout to smash
Give me some out that bag
Just get your own, you'll be glad (damn)

[Hook: Quavo]
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
We can make it happen
Get your rap snacks
We can make it snappin'
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
We can make it happen
Get your rap snacks
We can make it snappin'
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset
Get your rap snacks with a dab of ranch
If there ain’t no more call the ambulance
See all of these flavors gone make you dance
My face on the chips take her out her pants
My chips are worldwide thats a lot of land
It’s tasting too good it is out of hand
When I’m done with the bag I’m gone lick my hand
I sign a few bags give 'em to the fans
Sour cream with a dab of ranch
Taste buds had a heart attack
Emergency call the ambulance
I done ran outta snacks
For the love of me get your rap snacks
Get your whole hood all on that
First bag on me, get your rap snacks
Get ya whole hood all on that

[Outro: Quavo]
Dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
When you get a little hungry
Don’t panic
Just dab and ranch it
When you get a little hungry
Don’t panic
Just dab and ranch it
