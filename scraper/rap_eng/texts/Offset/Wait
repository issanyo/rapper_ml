[Verse 1: Vory]
Like 4AM, why the hell I just text my ex?
Pull up on her for the late night fix
I know you got a man, but he ain't like this
She been down since nothin'
Now I'm on, she gets everything
I'm thinkin' she the one for me
But I still can't let him get one up on me
If I got it, you got it
My problems, your problems
I ain't breaking my promise
Just tryna be honest

[Bridge: Vory]
Make it hard to love you
Is it really how it's supposed to be
They talking 'bout that nonsense
Lets put all that shit aside, so girl just...

[Chorus: Vory]
Wait, hey
We was movin' too fast and then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on babe
Wait, hey
Movin' too fast but then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on just
Wait on me, wait on me (wait)
Wait on me, wait on me, oh just
Wait on me, wait on me, yeah

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hey
Wait, your friends always hatin' on me
I really think they wanna double date on me
I'm the villain but she tryna put a cape on me
Briefcase in the Wraith, got a safe on me
Pipe a bitch up, put her on flex (pipe her up)
Slide in your ocean with a latex (slide)
Got her eyes wide open off the white baguettes (white)
I'ma try my best to get the check off your respect (check)
Give me neck, neck with twenty people on the jet (neck)
She be wet, wet, drippin', drippin' on the bed (drip)
I'm a vet, yeah it's P-I-M-P in the flesh
In the coupe with yo' main, so you know the rest (hey)

[Chorus: Vory]
Wait, hey
We was movin' too fast and then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on babe
Wait, hey
Movin' too fast but then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on just
Wait on me, wait on me (wait)
Wait on me, wait on me, oh just
Wait on me, wait on me, yeah

[Bridge: Offset & Vory]
4AM
Text my ex
Late night fix
Still can't let him get one up on me
Make it hard to love you
Is it really how it's supposed to be
They talking 'bout that nonsense
Lets put all that shit aside, so girl just...

[Chorus: Vory]
Wait, hey
We was movin' too fast and then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on babe
Wait, hey
Movin' too fast but then we lost it
Wait, hey
I would understand if you moved on just
Wait on me, wait on me (wait)
Wait on me, wait on me, oh just
Wait on me, wait on me, yeah
