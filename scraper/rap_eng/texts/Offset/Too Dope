One button push then my doors are ajar
Very important whereever we are
Longway soprano, MPA the mob
Ride down to L.A., Atlanta
Too rich and [?] dressin' in hanibal
Bitch you can't test it like I'm MC hammer
Theres levels to this bigger bezel (brr brr brr ice baby)
Change the weather, Mississippi stage Guiseppe stepper
Got your bitch to bathe me I'm the hefner
Active promethazine my medicine
Bitch can't know whats happin'
Fuckin' on your bitch eatin' up the rubber

Got niggas vouchin' for me adlibbin'

Send my niggas to your door like subpoena

Baddest mamacita foreign Costa Rica
Pull up in the Jag, bald head like a eagle

My diamonds is wet somebody bring a towel
Money bring power, Margielas made a cow
