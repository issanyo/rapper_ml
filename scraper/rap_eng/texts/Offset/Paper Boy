[Intro]
This a nice lil beat huh?
I don't got no time for this though
I left jail I'm a new man
I'm in London got my beat from London

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
Water 'round my neck they can call me a sailor boy
But on the real I got money
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
But on the real I got money money money
But on the real I got money money money

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I get paper, Frontpage of the newspaper boy
I rock Gucci, on my salad I need some capers boy
I used to be thuggin' i was running around
'til my mama told me calm down
Whole Gang got 9s If they see you, you get blasted
Sniper Gang, South Florida you know what's happening
I got wings, timbs on my feet I ain't even capping
Cuban Link 'round my neck cold like Alaska
I just hopped up out the jet, bitch I'm the alpha
Lil nigga in the streets acting a rascal
I was like that too until I became a rapper
I got myself some money and look what happened
I was on bean when I got out
Nigga I felt like a bullet I shot out
I'm only gettin' better bitch watch out
Now I'm like Kyrie I ball out

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
Water 'round my neck they can call me a sailor boy
But on the real I got money
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
But on the real I got money money money
But on the real I got money money money

[Verse 2: Offset]
Paper boy Custom chains dripping like Phelps (drip)
Hot just like a sauna so the Ice around me melt (woo)
Flooded out my wrist and I flooded my neck
Bitch I'm I'm from the north I ain't worried 'bout shit (no)
Me and Kodak on the block yeah know that
Lil Bitch on my dick better blow that (yuh)
I just pulled at a show new Patek on my wrist
Lame niggas with Rickys and Diamonds that pink
Lil nigga I been moving bricks
Fuck a lil bitch pass her to the clique
Just like D Rose 50 pointer on my wrist
Came up from the mud and now a nigga rich (hey)
Glock shoot like a star make a wish
Fornite shit, Whipping with pumps, bitch fully equipped
Stay Hop out the roof in this bitch like it's lit
Big dog nigga you can't tame me, just quit
Walk around with  toilet paper you can call me the shit
Mansion chain 'round my neck, on my windows see the tint

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
Water 'round my neck they can call me a sailor boy
But on the real I got money
I done made so much money you can call me paper boy
Just out jail now I'm just tryna make that paper boy
But on the real I got money money money
But on the real I got money money money
