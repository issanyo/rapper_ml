[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
Me and my hubbyman rollin' through the badlands
Love with the badman
Love me a badman
Me and my hubbyman rollin' through the badlands
Love with the badman
Love me a badman
Love me a badman
Love me a badman
Love me a badman
Love me a badman

[Verse 1: Quavo]
She love a bad man that gon' break all the rules
She like when I tell her buss a move
She like when I buy her Louis Vuitton shoes
You be good to that girl man I know you a fool
Turn around to the back back make her smack that
Oh my god please tell me why your booty so fat
Like the way that she walk like a duck quack quack
Say she got a man ain't ask you all of that
Look at that girl take a look at her body
I think I want to purchase her a Ferrari
All the mamacita lookin' at me in the party
[?] later ain't no doubt about it
Mechanic robotic my coupe is a Audi
The energy is taking over my body
When I step in the party I start a riot
I'm not worried 'bout it cause I know that she like it

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away

[Verse 2: Offset & Takeoff]
Offset!
I'm the Batman in town hit him with a hundred rounds
I got O's in my kitchen not talkin' about a noun
The molly like a mouthpiece it got her bitin' down
Beat it like a speaker she gettin' drunk off tequila
I'm a madman a batman I gotta [?]
Take her out the port baby you can call me Peter
I'm a jeweler like Anita we dem boyz like Khalifa
I'm a bad boy like Didi got my money out the trenches
I bought her a Bentley because lil mama expensive
I'm lookin' at my haters through Versace they vintage
And she love to get high we got the gas in the swishers
She know that I'm a criminal I'm an alien got tentacles
Standin' on a pedestal
My pocket filled with vegetables
I Put it on my schedule she perfect she impeccable
I might give her a physical I don't trust her cause she skeptical
She want a young nigga to [?] but [?] a flight to Russia
Private jet to Bahamas took a meeting with her mama
She do safari she dressin' like she from the jungle
Bitin' like piranha jumpin' on my anaconda
Walk up in the club I'm feelin' like a million
They call me Big Poppa I feelin' like my name Biggie
Ask her if she want to take a ride in my Bentley (Mulsanne)
Laughin' at you niggas cause you pullin' up infinity
Black Maison Margielas I'm lookin' like [?]
Feel like Machiavelli a nigga got all the enemies
Lamborghini Gallardo you movin' like a Centipede
Choppin' the top off the lambo nigga doin' surgery
Smokin' on Hercules red on the bottom of my shoes its in a murder scene
Choppin' I'm dabbin' I'm havin' I'm givin' out currency
24k on my neck I'm lookin' like I'm Mr. T
We kickin' it like Jackie Chan lil mama speakin' Japanese

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
One shot shot one got away ay
One shot shot one got away
