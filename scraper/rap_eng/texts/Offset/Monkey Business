[Intro: Offset]
Monsta's gon’ tear it up
Hey
Woo

[Chorus: Offset]
Slide on that nigga (Slide)
Ride on that nigga (Ride)
Fuck on his bitch (Thot)
Say bye to that nigga (Bye-bye)
You niggas not fuckin' with us (At all)
You niggas not winnin' (No)
My necklace cost me a bunch (Racks)
They think that I’m sinnin' (Who? Who?)
You niggas ain't weighin' enough (Nope)
Bein' a boss for the image (Boss)
And yes, I'm a menace (Yes)
I turn to a gremlin (Arr)
Yeah, I watch my back (Back)
The grip on the MAC (Brrt brrt)
I got a dummy safe (Dummy)
With a couple of racks

[Verse 1: Brianna Perry]
AirBus 380, never coach (Nah)
Spend a rack on this Chanel broach
Feel like Kane, I had to kill a ghost
Power moves, my niggas buyin' boats
Talkin' cheese with all my hoodrats (Yeah)
Big facts, you know I’m good for that
Hundred M’s, I'm overdue for that
Ain’t no tellin' what I'ma do for that
They don't understand this shit
White diamonds, Taylor Swift
Mayonnaise sandwichs
Ask Colin Kaepernick
Only way to stand for this
Talkin’ black excellence
Fuck the wall, Mexicans
On my George Jefferson
Movin' up, expectin' when
Next of kin, test 'em in, bless the pen, hoo
Tried to fuck the prom queen
Now you're Harvey Weinstein
Certified dime piece
Hard to even find these
Her mama got stripes, Raf Simons
Type of chick you with reflect your image
Courtside with Venus, talkin' tennis
H&M, we talkin' monkey business

[Chorus: Offset]
Slide on that nigga (Slide)
Ride on that nigga (Ride)
Fuck on his bitch (Thot)
Say bye to that nigga (Bye-bye)
You niggas not fuckin' with us (At all)
You niggas not winnin' (No)
My necklace cost me a bunch (Racks)
They think that I'm sinnin' (Who? Who?)
You niggas ain't weighin' enough (Nope)
Bein' a boss for the image (Boss)
And yes, I'm a menace (Yes)
I turn to a gremlin (Arr)
Yeah, I watch my back (Back)
The grip on the MAC (Brrt brrt)
I got a dummy safe (Dummy)
With a couple of racks

[Verse 2]
Back bitch, switched my approach
380 Wraith and that roach
21, I turned to LV
Fendi and I used to do Coach
16's, VVS stones
Penthouse, honey, I'm home
I was on road for that paper
Came back just to get dome
Five hustles just to get cash
Sold everything except ass
Benz gon' make me the B class
Name me one thing that I lack
Look mixed, bitch, I'm black
Bitches don't rap, they act
And I ain't got time for all that
New Patek, time for all that
Take a ride to the Keys, on the skis for the breeze
Hall of fame, out your league
Yellow jacket that pussy
Go'n and lick it, it's gushy
You bitches ain't that important
Dance on the money like Carleton
They say my cookie a fortune
Nina Simone in my Jordans
Early morning, countin' C notes
Wake up talkin' shit, Ebro
Closet full of Valentino
Courtside, sippin' pino, hey

[Chorus: Offset]
Slide on that nigga (Slide)
Ride on that nigga (Ride, baow)
Fuck on his bitch (Ooh, ooh)
Say bye to that nigga (Grrr)
You niggas not fuckin' with us (At all)
You niggas not winnin' (No)
My necklace cost me a bunch (Racks)
They think that I'm sinnin' (Who? Who?)
You niggas ain't weighin' enough (Nope)
Bein' a boss for the image (Huh)
And yes, I'm a menace (Yes)
I turn to a gremlin (Arr)
Yeah, I watch my back (Back)
The grip on the MAC (Brrt brrt)
I got a dummy safe (Dummy)
With a couple of racks (Offset)
