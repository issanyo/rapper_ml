[Bridge: Quavo]
I can't get enough
Them blue stripped hundreds, I can't get enough
Them blue stripped hundreds
All these women, I can't get enough
Taking drugs accross the country, I can't get enough
The migo life I want it, I can't get enough
Your bitch I know she want me, she gon' give it up

[Hook: Quavo]
I can't get enough, no no no

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Can't get enough of me winnin'
Can't get enough of these women
Can't get enough of that money, so I stash it in the ceiling
No, no I can't get enough
If a nigga wanna hate on me I just might pull out the pump
Smokin' sour in the tower
I got the power
One plug, you know pull up on us by the hour
I can't get enough of the workin'
I know a nigga need a verse
I told my momma, she won't never see me rhyme in the hearse
She can't get enough of designer, everyday I buy her a purse
Than I told her Imma make it rapping, she believed in me first
Imma bring home the M&M's, momma I give you my word
Everytime I take you out the people around me go berzerk
Can't get enough my life, no Yo Gotti, I am
Can't enough of the price
Imma tax you, Uncle Sam
She can't get enough of that camera, since I put her on the red carpet
Can't get enough of the hood [?]

[Verse 2: Johnny Cinco]
I can't get enough, [?] time, gotta run it up
We stay down, now get enough
Now these hoes can't enough
I don't know I been on a roll
Early fly, got another show
Cover [?], they'll never know
Turn out my pockets, better let them know
I don't know, I done lost the time
Hundred thousand for my wrist to shine
Young rich nigga, yeah that's every time
They really wish they were on this grind
Me and Quavo, we can't get enough, got our riches up
These bitches feeling us, but I ain't feel enough
I ain't never switching up, swear that I can get enough

[Verse 3: Offset]
Benjamin Franklin, can't get enough
Kickin' them doors had to give it up
Not sellin' my soul or give it up
For a million dollars and a tour bus
Locked up in jail, I had enough
We trappin' the band, had to add it up
I'm 22 and I'm a bachelor
Giuseppe Safari from Africa
She lookin' delicious, but I won't lick it
Not cuffin' them bitches, that fuck my niggas
Now my dick in her water like I be fishing
I just wanna fuck that's my only mission
You give her some money , then she gon' miss
I can't get enough baby take off your [?]
Smacking ass and I'm gripping shit
Private jet flyin' from city to city
Can't get enough of you baby girl, Offset addicted
She don't answer my calls
I just wanna draw baby girl I need it
Victoria, she can't keep a secret
I told her don't tell nobody
Now my momma wanna meet her
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Would you still be right here if it was bricks in the truck
Would you still be right here if I had no bucks
I know what's on
