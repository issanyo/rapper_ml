[Hook: Quavo]
These niggas make me wanna fuck the club up
He must be mad ‘cause I fucked his girl huh
Hundos in my pocket, I ain’t got no change chump
What the fuck you pressin’ for? We gon' fuck this club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
I came in with my squad, fuck the club up
If you don’t hit with the squad you a buster
Everybody in my squad fuck the club up

[Verse 1: Migo Domingo]
We a hundred niggas deep, Migo Gang
Fifty on the left, fifty on the right
Damn, fucking all night
If it really got to it would you stay in there and fight?
We in the club on sight
Beat a nigga up, hit him with the mic
If a nigga outnumbered
Pull out the rocket, take a nigga’s life
Fuck the club up
We jumping off stage nigga, we don’t give a fuck
You looking at my chain nigga, come and try your luck
Throwing bottles from the VIP, lil nigga better duck
I’m a migo so you know I keep a nine
Have them boys at your show for a very low price
Life is a gamble and I’m good with the dice
Fire a nigga up, leave him cold like ice

[Hook: Quavo]
These niggas make me wanna fuck the club up
He must be mad ‘cause I fucked his girl huh
Hundos in my pocket, I ain’t got no change chump
What the fuck you pressin’ for? We gon' fuck this club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
I came in with my squad, fuck the club up
If you don’t hit with the squad you a buster
Everybody in my squad fuck the club up

[Verse 2: Quavo]
What he lookin’ for? Nigga what you muggin’ for?
I just look at my right hand mans, he pop  it off
Fuck the club up, we on the stage, we jumping off
25 hundred, you hit him and you break your jaw
Security ain’t breaking up nothing ‘cause they paid off
If I feel I’m ‘bout to take a loss my pocket rocket go off
Already been through some losses
Now a young nigga made bosses
If you touch me man I swear you gon’ swim with the dolphins
Waking up early, kicking in doors, man I swear I earned it
This my life, he try to take it I’ma have to burn him
But I swear to god I don’t want to
If I talk about it I gotta be about it
Phone jewels bout to drop out it
The money I made I can’t talk about it

[Hook: Quavo]
These niggas make me wanna fuck the club up
He must be mad ‘cause I fucked his girl huh
Hundos in my pocket, I ain’t got no change chump
What the fuck you pressin’ for? We gon' fuck this club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
I came in with my squad, fuck the club up
If you don’t hit with the squad you a buster
Everybody in my squad fuck the club up

[Verse 3: Offset]
Fuck the club up
Nigga buckin’, I give him a buzzcut
Domingo hit the nigga with a snubnose
In the kitchen, I’m cookin’ the blow, C4
You know I’m a Nawfside hero
Started from the bottom, had zero
Ran through the paper like I work at Kinko’s
Young rich nigga, I’m a Migo
They know I don’t play
Massachusetts, had to jump off the stage
In Carolina had to pull out the K
My niggas hungry, put some food on they plate
That’s the only way my niggas get paid
Every city GD throw up the wraith
Shoot the nigga and the witness, no case
Talkin’ behind my back, say it to my face
Migo gang nigga, throw it in your face
Sad to say Pistol P up in the grave
Eiffel tower, got the tat on my face
I’ma catch them niggas, put that shit on your grave
Jumping up and down like it’s a rave
Had a million when I got out the cage
Mango Foo hit ‘em with the gage
Beat these niggas to sleep like rampage

[Hook: Quavo]
These niggas make me wanna fuck the club up
He must be mad ‘cause I fucked his girl huh
Hundos in my pocket, I ain’t got no change chump
What the fuck you pressin’ for? We gon' fuck this club up
Fuck the club up, fuck the club up
I came in with my squad, fuck the club up
If you don’t hit with the squad you a buster
Everybody in my squad fuck the club up
