[Intro: Offset]
It's a championship
It's a championship
It's a championship
I got six rings, its a championship
Its a championship, ooh

[Chorus: Offset]
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, I got six rings
I got six rings, I got six rings
Its a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, girls kissing on lips
I got foreign whips, my ice go drip
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship

[Verse 1: Offset]
I’m a champion, legend like Muhammad Ali
Flipping the money like Tony Hawk Ollie
They didn't see it coming God had disguised me
When I look into the scope like I’m a pirate
The government talking bout stopping the violence
They slaving our people, we start up a riot
Predicted my future like I was a Mayan
In the jungle got the heart of a lion
Investigation, niggas snitching they lying
I picked up an ark like I was Noah, championship rings like Balboa
Finessing niggas, smoother than velour
Real trappers hopping out the Porsche
All this pain, I got scar sores
Got the game in a lock like the figure four
You say you a champ, what you did it for?
I told my momma go and get the Porsche
All that yelling, you didn't know your voice is hoarse
But I listened to it, it was in my core
All these haters around me I just ignore ‘em
I go to the Bible to get a source
Don’t fall in love even though pussy moist
She bit the apple that’s the reason for it


[Chorus: Offset]
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, I got six rings
I got six rings, I got six rings
Its a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, girls kissing on lips
I got foreign whips, my ice go drip
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Its a championship, I'm no Dan Marino
More like Steve Montana, speaking on my MO
Consistent Tom Brady, rookie Russel Wilson
I will go the distance, win by feet not inches (yeah, yeah)
Trophy models and the play in motion
We ain't woofin' when the [?]
Shittin', shittin'[?]
Never fluke, never Eli Manning
She thirsty, starving, she just wanna dead it
I'm super focused with her like an addict
I'm timeless like diamonds, [?]
This gold on my chain screaming fuck the badges
I see through your [?]
Breaking the game screaming fuck the damages
[?]
Beat em like Bruins, Red wings how we use them sticks
This fire on me but it ain't a bic
I'm rarely tired and I never loose
Achieve it, defeated, ain't hard to choose
I come from a city where stats matter
Team dependent like the ninth batter

[Chorus: Offset]
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, I got six rings
I got six rings, I got six rings
Its a championship, it's a championship
I got six rings, girls kissing on lips
I got foreign whips, my ice go drip
It's a championship, it's a championship
It's a championship
