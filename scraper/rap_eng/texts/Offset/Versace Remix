[Verse 1: Game]
Nigga worth 25 million and these on my happy they just call me Chachi
I had the bitches since I was in eighth grade rocking Gebroze Herachis
Cause now I got bitches from Compton to London wake up in my Bugatti in Abu Dhabe
Now it’s Givency Givency Givency Givency Givency Givency
These bitches I came with is booshy and all of my niggas is raunchy
So I fuck with Drake in LA cause a nigga can’t get in Toronto
Rock leather so much that my closet look like there’s a zoo in my condo
Versace Versace Versace Versace is all on my Chain
Medusa is all on my neck and I’m rocking these snakes on a plane
Walking in Louie and Gucci and spending so much that I’m going insane
My head be spending like nananana and I never fuck with Molly's again
I’m turnt up, tires balled like a motherfucker burnt up
On the day boy ride through the hood with my nigga
Kev Hart watch a nigga set fire on you bitches
[Kevin Hart] (Ay Game get fire on these bitches one time)
L.A.B-ass nigga, local ass bitch
I’m balling in Europe, car go yuuur
Your girl go ..
I throw up the deuces and pull out my dick and
Put on my chains
MCM MCM MCM that shit don't rhyme
These niggas be whack as a bitch but they get away with it all of the time
Far is Versace I am the king
Like I wanna Biggie to cup all of my jeans
You can ask Migos we balling with egos
When you in Versace with all of my people

[Verse 2: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Chorus: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
I know that you like it, Versace, my neck and my wrist is so sloppy
Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti, he give me the ducks, I know that they're mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch "Versace"
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain't ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don't fumble

[Chorus: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Cookin' this dope like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
These niggas they wishin' they knew you
They coppin' the Truey, remixing the Louis
My blunts is fat as Rasputia
In a striped shirt like I’m Tony the Tiger
I’m beating the pot, call me Michael
Lot of you niggas that copy
Look at my closet Versace, Versace

[Chorus: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace

[Verse 5: Offset]
King of Versace, Medusa my wifey
My car is Versace, I got stripes on my Mazi
I'm dressin' so nicely they can't even copy
You'd think I'm Egyptian, this gold on my body
Money my mission, two bitches, they kissin'
My diamonds is pissing, my swag is exquisite
Young Offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I’m gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I’m living
I’m draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that’s Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I’m the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose
Bought out the store, can’t go back no more
Versace my clothes while I’m selling them bows
Versace take over it took out my soul

[Chorus: Quavo]
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
