[Verse 1: Quavo]
Yes I was that trappa Man
I got that white and that cabbage man (I got that cabbage man)
Yes I am a rappa, man I rock the mic and that stage man (I run the stage!)
Now I get paid, man bitches they wanna get laid man (wanna get laid!)
Used to have 50 bricks in the Escalade man
Finnessin' them tickets, my money is stashed in the ceiling (stashed in the ceiling)
We don't give a fuck about yo' feelings
Fuck nigga, might end up missin' (my indo missin)
I'm a trappa turned rappa, the story is ended
(Trappa turned rappa!)
My niggas, they keep those extensions
Step yo' foot on my vicinity (cinity)
Hundred round issue the Infinity (finity)
Yo' bitches, they wanna come work for me (work for me)
They tired of workin' at the Burger King (Burger King)
I make 'em whip up a cajun piece
Whole bag of the onions, no onion rings

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Trappa turned rappa, I'm still in the bando
I rap in the closet and trap out the bando
100% product, you only got your 100% that my niggas are psycho
Check on my Twitter, my Instagram bio
It'll tell you I'm trappin' and rappin' in Dago
Thumb through the pesos with my 'migo Quavo
Overnight shipments, I don't need a layover
I get my pimpin', I told 'em the wait over
Take all my riches and bend yo' man bay over
Rich got ridiculous, whoopin' the coyola
I fucked yo' bitch and I gave her a makeover
Quality Control, the game is in takeover
Trappa turned rappa, trappa turned rappa
Break down and we make it clap like magnolia
Trappa turned rappa, trappa turned rappa
Don't get it confused not your average rapper, I get you wrapped up and kidnapped
I pity the fool for you industry fools, fuck nigga I C's in the trap
Run circles on niggas, I gone by two laps
Got bands in my pants, got yo' bitch out my lap
A quick understanding, I'm still in the trap with them young niggas like Rambo pimp at yo' cat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset
Trappin' and rappin', I made that shit happen
Bustin' a brick, now my knuckles is ashy
Either trappin' or rappin', don't matter it's lavish
I'm servin' the addicts, my money as tall as a attic
Got a 100 band juuggin', I grab it
I step on you maggots, yo' bitch wanna fuck cause she digging my fashion
All these damn karats, I look like a rabbit, this dirty ass money, I need me a record
Yo' turn up Offset, I say he be slappin'
Magnolia choppa they be clappin'
Shoot a fuck nigga, like Dirk on the Mavericks
Im in Orlando and I'm trappin' that magic
I juugg the finesse my way up to the top
I'm so proud of myself, Rolex with the clear rocks
Italian chinchilla made from a fox
Red dot on his body, he got chicken pox
The judge tried to sentence him, how the hell he worth a million?
My plug is an immigrant, bitches Brazilian
You niggas imposters, my money colossus
Neighbourhood crips and they killin' on Slauson
The white bricks my son and the tan is my daughter
Trappa turned rappa, livin' like Sean Carter
Cold heart specs on my face look like Arthur
I only fuck bitches that look like Ms Parker
