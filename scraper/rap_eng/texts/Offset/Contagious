[Intro: Meek Mill]
See what it is, they don't know a rock from a diamond
I'm like hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Wait a minute, motherfucker

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ugh!
I pull in your hood in a brand new Wraith (like skrr!)
Tell your bitch "Fall back, nigga", we ain't got no space
And your bitch ain't bad, nigga, you ain't got no taste
And everybody want to be the king, like the deck ain't got no Ace
Half of my bitches they richer than me
Hoes that you payin', I'm hittin' for free
I used to pass up on that pussy, my nigga
You payin' that thot just to give her some D
God damn, God damn
I'm with a white bitch named Roxanne
And she ain't home yet cause she got plans
And y'all hatin' niggas can't shake my hand

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Quavo]
Cause that shit contagious, these niggas outrageous
Started off buzzin' like pagers
Now I got paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where is my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas, shootin' dice at the table
The feds, they watch me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
A favor can get too contagious

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Migo and Meek Milly got stacks in the ceiling
I got money ties all the way up through Philly
I'm fuckin' your bitch and she from Puerto Rico
The plug is a papí, he send me the kilo
I hop on the jet, then I fly out to Vegas
Link up with the mob in Reno
Paparazzi, they flash and stare
And I pull out McLaren, I hop out Giuseppe toe
Young nigga, they know that QC the new Death Row
I'm in the kitchen cookin' antidote (I'm cookin' it)
Lookin' down on a fuck nigga
Cause a young nigga on a top ropes
Now everybody wanna take a picture
Now that young nigga's worth seven figures
Step out that vault and I'm countin' millions
Thankin' the Lord for the M&M's

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Quavo]
Cause that shit contagious, these niggas outrageous
Started off buzzin' like pagers
Now I got paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where is my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas, shootin' dice at the table
The feds, they watch me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
A favor can get too contagious

[Verse 3: Offset]
My migo', my vato, go check out my bio
Got bricks comin' in from Ohio
I’m in North Philly, I meet with Meek Milly
We tryna make millies off trappin' the chicken
You run up on me, you need Geico insurance
I run to the money, got plenty endurance
I shop overseas and you shoppin' on clearance
Spent 500K for my appearance
Offset a magician at work, I'm a wizard
Smokin' on loud so niggas gonna hear me
Pussy ass nigga, you sweeter than cinnamon
Thankin' the Lord while I count up blue Benjamins
Sippin' on Actavis, don't need a chaser
QC is the label, we fuck with Dreamchasers
My niggas they actin' a fool, but this is not actin'
The money, it runnin' my generation

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Quavo]
Cause that shit contagious, these niggas outrageous
Started off buzzin' like pagers
Now I got paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where is my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas, shootin' dice at the table
The feds, they watch me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
A favor can get too contagious

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Mason Margeilla, got dope on the tip of my toe
Got rich off a pot and the stove
Breakin' and droppin' in designer clothes
Cappin' trap out the back door of the bando
My plug is a migo, pull up on banana boat
F&N splittin' your head like a cantaloupe
Papparazzi flashin', pull out that Camaro
Damn, I mean camera, white girl from Canada
No, I'm not Tommy Lee but I got Pamela
In the back of the Maybach changin' channels
Lightin' the block up like Christmas candles
Bustin' my women, my ceilin' is panorama
OG gas bag on my back like I'm Santa
Droppin' up four in the one liter Fanta
Workin' it, flippin' that dope with a spatula
I flex in the chopper, you niggas are amateurs

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Quavo]
Cause that shit contagious, these niggas outrageous
Started off bustin' like pagers
Now I got paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where is my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas, shootin' dice at the table
The feds, they watch me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
A favor can get too contagious
