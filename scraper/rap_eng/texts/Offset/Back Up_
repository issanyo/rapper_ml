Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Playboi Carti]
What you thinkâ€”
Nigga, hold on
Hold up

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
I'm smokin' dope bitch (Slatt)
Smokin' dope bitch (Hol' up)
I'm smokin' dope bitch (Hol' up)
Smokin' dope bitch
I'm from South Atlanta, hoe
I got money then I wear white clothes
I'm like 2Pac
Nigga, I got two Glocks
You want what?
You want what? What?
Bentley coupe, yeah
Shawty wanna fuck 'cause she know she cool
Got the cash like ooh
I could buy your bitch, I could buy her coupe
I could buy them blocks
I could buy them blocks, I could buy your goons
I'm in the Westside
Wit' big [?] and big Pirus

[Interlude: Playboi Carti]
[?]
What you fuckin' talkin' 'bout? (What what, what)
29 shit, nigga, same gang for real, nigga (Do-do)
29, bitch
And she cool

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
(And I'm [?])
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up

[Verse 2: Offset]
(Offset!)
Racks up (Racks)
Choppa back up
[?], stashin' the dope, but put the pack up (Stash the dope)
Diamonds [?] (Ice)
Pull up in the spot in tarantula (Skrt, skrt)
Dirty my Fanta up
Sold out dates on the calendar (Hey, hey)
Two doors, two seats (Two, two)
Up my status in the league (Up my status)
My drip, you need (Drip)
[?]
My gang, they shoot the knee
Don't fuck on the gang for free
I'ma blow out the brain then breathe
I got drip, that's off the seasons
Smokin' on cook', I'm wheezin'
I'm on the drop, creatures (Drop)
White stone, I'll bleach you (White)
Saint Laurent, I'll teach you (Hey)
Choppa 'boutta eat you (Bite)
Double on my Wraith
It got the stars with the features (Stars)
Seeing with the beam
It hit you far, make it reach you (Where you goin'?)
Hold the stick like a guitar and it's lethal

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
(And I'm [?])
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
Back up, back up
