Murder, murder, murder shit

[Intro: Offset]
Keep all that shit when I'm talking, all that
I'm just gon' load that motherfucker up and pull up
Oh, you think, you think I'm sweet

[Verse 1: Offset]
Yeah, he thought it's sweet, yeah
Fuck on a freak, yeah
I made a hundred this week, yeah
Yeah, I popped a perky I'm geeked, yeah
Fuck on that freak on the sheets, yeah
Pull up in drop top rover hova
I feel like Hova, yeah
I pour a Folger Folger, yeah
Surrounded by dogs and cobras, yeah
Huh, yeah we some soldiers, uh
Put that lil bitch on a bolster
Stick in your mouth, you get motored
I heard that pussy boy told it
Folded, we knowed it
We knew that you niggas wasn't 'bout it 'bout it
Just bought the Bentley, didn't want the Masi
I put a two hundred thou' deposit
I made the profit, think I'm 'luminati
When I board on my jet I'ma count up the check
Icey Patek, I just put the baguettes
Sippin' on Actavis with a lil Tech
Yes, yeah, I got a big check
Run to the money but I never sweat
Yes, yes, go to the check, ayy
How does it feel to get mils?
Count up the mils and I get me a chill
Put her on percocet pills
Get on your knees, bitch you know what it is
Ah, I turn a beast on these niggas
Ah, I bet my bankroll is bigger
Ah, we do not fuck with these niggas
Nah, we from the Nawf and we killers

[Chorus: Offset]
Boggs Road, remember the time when Vic told
Remember Westside had the Tahoe
Drop top Mustangs, we drive those
That was like back in '09 though
We had the nine like Rondo
What the fuck I'ma be lyin' for?
Flip what you doin' with that blindfold?
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let her go
Fuck a ho, let her go, fuck a ho, let her go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let her go
Fuck a ho, let her go, fuck a ho, let her go

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
Said they want old school Impala
What would she do for a dollar?
If you suck it then you better swallow
And she sucked the whole team up just for a follow
Clean codeine, I'm a dope fiend
Twenty-four pints of Act like I'm Kobe
Six nugget rings, seven diamond chains
OG Flippa, you can never hold me
Get back-end when I show up, hold up
Only the cookie I roll up, pour up
Pull out a fifty then go up, slow up
We having humor, you know it, you know us
Just copped the Lam and I paint that bitch yellow
RIP Lo, and the grunts for the L-O
I go with the flow, that means I take it mellow
My rings look like Nuggets, you'll think that I'm Melo
Margiella stepper, only chasing cheddar
I could do it better, 1K for the sweater
I'm a trendsetter, Flippa Hugh Hefner
Diamonds water but I want 'em little wetter
Niggas snitching in the hood, man I wish a nigga would
Lil baby love to ride the wood
Would you shoot her if you could?
We having so we do the most
Pull out the hover car, put up the Ghost
We popped a pint and then we have a toast
Tell him lay off if he play with the yo
Safe house in the Madison
If it's beef then we at'ed them
I'm from the Nawf, that's the trenches
Shoot first, didn't matter then

[Chorus: Offset]
Boggs Road, remember the time when Vic told
Remember Westside had the Tahoe
Drop top Mustangs, we drive those
That was like back in '09 though
We had the nine like Rondo
What the fuck I'ma be lyin' for?
Flip what you doin' with that blindfold?
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let her go
Fuck a ho, let her go, fuck a ho, let her go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let it go
Take it slow, pour a four, fuck a ho, let her go
Fuck a ho, let her go, fuck a ho, let her go
