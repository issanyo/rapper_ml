[Intro: Offset]
Rich nigga shit nigga
Long Way! Rich! MIGOS! Woah!
Rich nigga shit nigga
Live and laugh

[Verse 1: Offset]
Bad bitch from Bermuda, my lambo way cuter
I drop the top let it fold up like a Apple macbook computer (pew pew pew pew pew)
Thats my niggas they shootas, pullin up wit the Rugers, the Uzi's, who you is?
Smokin exotic, takin a trip to the tropics
Wrappin dem babies and trappin dem babies
My niggas you know that we got it
Trap be jumpin hydraulics, trappin the white Miley Cyrus
Finessin' the plug we show em no love, my nigga we movin' in silence
Offset the Don, I come from the slums
My niggas keep loaves you niggas got crumbs
Workin my wrist, cookin the dish
I am no server but im servin the dish
Run wit that sack then my niggas go miss
Its white in the pot but you know its not gritz
They need the dope they havin a itch
Offset a genie I'm grantin' they wish!

[Hook: Pee Wee Longway & Offset]
Break and break with baking soda, cut like Edward scissor hands
Karate choppin' the dope so much I was pullin' a stunt like I'm Jackie Chan
Break the Pyrex pot
Medusa make them bitches do they dance
Bootin' up like its a house party
I got the straight drop Molly Santana
Straight drop
Straight drop
Straight drop
Bootin' up I got that Molly Santana!
Straight drop
Straight drop
Straight drop
Breakin' the pot turnin' the deuce to a ten

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
Breaking the pot tryna' burn a Cuban
Hunnid percent them boys don’t understand it
Still take the bricks, stuff it in your hoe panties
Private elite when a young nigga landing
Serving ya dope, ya hoe play wit my toes
I keep it pimpin' and throw back a fo'
Offset my pimpin', can’t pronounce my clothes
I send a package, that bitch adiós
I just got quick powder, threatened Chapo
Karate chopping the dope [?]
Gonna heat it up until it’s no more
Booting up Molly Santana, my little Bobby Brown
Longway gon' boot up your hoe
Pulling up like [?]
Do a 3 levels, I’m riding it ghost
Edward Scissorhands, cutting the dope
Look at him dance, call him Terio
My nigga, my ears, they radio
Bands in my pants, don’t overload
I walked in the party, boot up ya hoe
Molly Santana came in from Primo
House party taking [?]
[?]
Straight drop molly, make that shit a go

[Hook: Pee Wee Longway &Offset]
Break and break with baking soda, cut like Edward scissor hands
Karate choppin' the dope so much I was pullin' a stunt like I'm Jackie Chan
Break the Pyrex pot
Medusa make them bitches do they dance
Bootin' up like its a house party
I got the straight drop Molly Santana
Straight drop
Straight drop
Straight drop
Bootin' up I got that Molly Santana
Straight drop
Straight drop
Straight drop
Breakin' the pot turnin' the deuce to a ten

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
My niggas who did ‘em, they get 36’s, only supplying the purest
My neck is worth kills, I know that I’m trippin’, I’m having on too much jewelry
The kitchen is hot, straight girl right out of the pot
And only a fresh inhale, [?] the feds, [?] or not my nigga
They living a lie, never [?]
I stay hot, weed and lean on my supply
[?] lies

[Verse 4: MPA Duke]
Only the strongest survive
Trap house busy like a motherfuckin' McDonald’s, selling them burgers and fries
Nigga asked me for a brick, told his ass 65
Kicking the ball from the bay to the [?]
How do you think that they fly?
I’m in that cocaine, white ghosts
Getting mistaken for Casper
[?]
Look like I live in the [?]
