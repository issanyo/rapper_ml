[Hook]
Dope boy on the block tryna make a flip
I can't believe I got fame, look where I came with a 9 in my hip
When you geting money, you gon' change the way that you live
My bitch go both ways and I ain't tripping on that bitch
Take one shot, take two shots (x6)

[Verse 1]
Take one shot take two shots
We pulling up in the brand new drops
Cuffing these bitches you niggas is cops
She suck me up but I don't eat the box
In the industry you get only one shot
We grinding non stop and we not gonna flop
Your bitch she suck me up like a lollipop
Allergic to broke give me chicken pox
Ooooh sexy chocolate drop, slow, sipping actavis at night
I keep the savages with me with pistols my nigga why not
You like the type of nigga I can beat with my hands with no eyes
If you ain't know 20,000 ain't enough
I can get you knocked off for a dime
I was so blind I had to do time
50,000 for my rhymes
20,000 for my uh uh
Quarter million for my fisker
I'm working that bitch and you kiss her
Oh smash her, dismiss her
I'm official, you niggas is unofficial
I'm a millionaire but I still keep the pistol
Come and take one shot and fuck with a nigga
Taking 2 shots you be fucking a nigga
I got out of jail and have plenty benjis
Thank the lord for the vision and the mission he sent me

[Hook]
