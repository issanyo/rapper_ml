[Intro]
Ay, Ay, Ayyyy

[Hook]
I ain't tryna put it in your throat
Bitch you know I am the goat
All white diamonds like the pope
Blurred vision I just poured a four
200 thousand a key
Your car is a lease
My wrist 40 piece
And my ear 10 a piece
Your bitch like to eat
So much dab it's a feast
We came from the street
Put the gang on they feet

[Verse 1]
I'm living my dream
My Glock got a beam
My phone keep on ringing
Diamonds shine like oil sheen
Birds keep on singing
Bitch drink my semen
Money bring demons
But God gonna clean it
I'm on the percolator
Suck on my dick and you masturbate it
My niggas celebrating
Then we got money then elevated
The magazine illustrated
Talk about Migos we really made it
Trapping and capping baby
Now I'm trafficking the records baby
Cocaine, selling cocaine
Smoking cookie, propane
Might take your hoe mayne
Ima boozie young nigga eating lo mein
Free the Wop mane
I let my dope swang

[Hook]
I ain't tryna put it in your throat
Bitch you know I am the goat
All white diamonds like the pope
Blurred vision I just poured a four
200 thousand a key
Your car is a lease
My wrist 40 piece
And my ear 10 a piece
Your bitch like to eat
So much dab it's a feast
We came from the street
Put the gang on they feet
