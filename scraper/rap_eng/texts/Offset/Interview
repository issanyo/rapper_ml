[Chorus: Takeoff]
They say that nigga that don't talk much
Is that nigga that having them large bucks
We gotta make sure we hit first
No more drive-bys, we do walk-ups
We on top, ain't no runner up
Come on our side, tape and chalk up
Look like I just robbed the bank, all this money
I'm just tryna fill my vault up

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Don't ask me no questions in no more interviews
'Cause I don't really like to talk much (nah)
Not that I don't know how to speak
It's you just ain't paying me enough to talk much (nah)
Not paying attention to tweets
'Cause if I look at em I'll wanna off somethin'
On Instagram flexing Phillipe
Like you the first, but I been bought one (stop it)
Ain't posting no drank on the Internet
But I be drinking codeine when that drought come (lean)
She told me she from Puerto Rico
But after that head, I asked where that mouth from (swear)
I knew that was the outcome (outcome)
Ask me where I get my style from (style from)
Sherbert cookies in the Wild Rum (cookie)
China plug out in Taiwan
Nawfside where I come from (Nawfside)
Cuban link on top of tennis bracelet
Another Cuban link, that's on the right arm
My niggas don't do no talking
They eyeing them niggas to see what they on (eye)
With fashion I'm wildin', must have a stylist
Way that I put that shit on
Pull up I'm dropping the top on a Dawn (Rolls)
Wrist glis' bitch, broke bitch need a fix
Paranoid, watching cameras, take a shit with my stick (brrt)
Off the jet to my shows, back on jets with your bitch
She get wet, out them clothes, give her dick and that's it (smash)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
They say that nigga that don't talk much
Is that nigga that having them large bucks
We gotta make sure we hit first
No more drive-bys, we do walk-ups
We on top, ain't no runner up
Come on our side, tape and chalk up
Look like I just robbed the bank, all this money
I'm just tryna fill my vault up

[Verse 2: Offset]
I make a hundred thousand on an accident (accident)
Pushing weight, my pockets masculine (uh)
Ain't no nigga running up and snatching shit (nah)
I was hoping not to have to whack a bitch (whack)
I just paid 500K for the whip (racks)
I just paid 100K for the wrist (woo)
Clarity, wedding band rings on my fist
It's a charity, giving out dick to your bitch
Bigger faces got me dripping lately (woo)
The chopper working whats the bitch-uation
Mansion gated, gang affiliated
Trappin' the bomb, I had detonated
I stand in the pot, make it incubated (stand in that)
Bought a plain watch, I didn't want the glacier (plain)
Hop on that jet, Gucci aviators (aviators)
300 deep ain't no gladiators (gladiators)
Got a big bank in my vault (vault)
Sharpshooters on top of the roof
It's a hole in one nigga like golf (boom)
Niggas out here throwing salt
I let the money go talk (money)
I'm rich, you can see what I bought (yeah)
I'm on Saturn I'm sipping on cough (mud)
Cook the batter then send the work off (woo woo)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
They say that nigga that don't talk much
Is that nigga that having them large bucks
We gotta make sure we hit first
No more drive-bys, we do walk-ups
We on top, ain't no runner up
Come on our side, tape and chalk up
Look like I just robbed the bank, all this money
I'm just tryna fill my vault up
