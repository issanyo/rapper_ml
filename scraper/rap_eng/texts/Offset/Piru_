Lyrics from Snippet

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We in Bouldercrest
Put a lil' hole in his back
Sipping on Act, don’t crack
My lil' partner [?] got whacked
Young nigga do what we got to
I'ma die next to the mob
I’ma die lit on that Piru, get down
My bitch, yeah she down, tell her open up
Let me shoot some rounds, yeah, swallow it up
That bitch dumb as fuck, yeah, yellow bus
On that molly still, yeah, chew it up

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Dirty yellow Fanta, like to hold it up
Dirty like Diana, go and pour it up
After sex, bitch, I gotta roll one up
I got sticks, my lil' boy gon' fold 'em up
I got bricks, load 'em up on Tonka truck
Fuck this bitch, fuck that hoe then got the fuck
Suck this dick, eat it up bitch, yeah, pucker up
Body kicks, line it up, put it on a Bentayga truck

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We in Bouldercrest
Put a lil' hole in his back
Sipping on Act, don't crack
My lil boy got whacked
Young nigga do what we got to
I'ma die next to the mob
I’ma die lit on that Piru, get down
My bitch, yeah she down, tell her open up
Let me shoot some rounds, yeah, swallow it up
That bitch dumb as fuck, yeah, yellow bus
On that molly still, yeah, chew it up

[Verse 2: Offset]
(Hey, hey)
In an all white Phantom with the semi tucked
Get on your head like dandruff, smoking on cookie mud
Trappin’ out the bando (Bando)
Living like the mob, Soprano (Mob)
[?] up the [?] rainbow
[?]
Chop it with a knife, no ammo
We don't like to fight with a Draco
Bullet to the knife in the leg flow
Stacking these M’s, Lego
My iPhone film, light show
My trip European [?]
Blowin' racks in the wind, high roll
[?] wrapped my wrists, it's a gyro

[Chorus: Playboi Carti]
We in Bouldercrest
Put a lil' hole in his back
Sipping on Act, don’t crack
My lil boy got whacked
Young nigga do what we got to
I'ma die next to the mob
I'ma die lit on that Piru, get down
My bitch, yeah she down, tell her open up
Let me shoot some rounds, yeah, swallow it up
That bitch dumb as fuck, yeah, yellow bus
On that molly still, yeah, chew it up
