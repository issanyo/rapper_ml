'Cause they not gon' rob me (Nope!)
Pound a cookie in the backstage of Jimmy Fallon

Get right wit cha', Saint Laurent boots on Gucci saddles

Scotty 2 Hotty, she fucked everybody, can't wife the lil' bitch, she a thotty (thotty)
They know we been a trendin' topic (know that)
But now this shit lookin' real obvious (obvious)
We been sellin' out them arenas but since we went platinum look at the audience (audience)
I poured a fo', feelin' nausea (Actavis)
Drinkin' to help the insomnia (drink)
Migos but move like the mafia
Can't see it, you need some binoculars (blind)
We been through so many obstacles (obstacles)
If it ain't 'bout money, can't talk to you (talk to you)
I had no choice to get up and go get it, but I heard that you had it optional (you did)
I told 'em at school, I was popular (popular)
The teacher said it was impossible (impossible)
They takin' the flow and ain't givin' us credit so I don't have nothin' to offer you
(Take-Takeoff)
