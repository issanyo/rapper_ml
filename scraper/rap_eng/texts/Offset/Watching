I've been watching you for a long long time
Hop off in my coop, wanna take you on a ride
Red bottoms dripping off you from head to toe, oh my
Take you on a ride, baby girl, don't ly
Baby girl, don't hide

[Verse: JBan$2Turnt]
My bitch, she bad and she know it, bout that money, she going
Red bottoms, you can't ignore it
Wrist, I hold to the court
She got Shanele on her ankel, big racks, yeah, she goin blow it
She don't need them niggas for nothing, them hundreds, got them all bout it
Red bottoms, dripping know it
2 door coop, don't notice
Hundreds and thousands in my moter, same on the engin, keep that 5 with no holster
I've been watching you for a very long time
Hop up in my coop, let's take a very long ride
Diamonds on your soul, yeah, you shine
Look at the time, together for life
Bitch real bad, and she know it

[Hook: Offset]
I've been watching you for a long long time
Hop off in my coop, wanna take you on a ride
Red bottoms dripping off you from head to toe, oh my
Take you on a ride, baby girl, don't ly
Baby girl, don't hide
