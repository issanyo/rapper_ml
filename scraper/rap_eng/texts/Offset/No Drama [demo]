[Refrain]
I can't cop the coupe don't do shit for two
All black trucks shooters out the roof
Boy you better duck don't know what to do
I can't cop the coupe don't do shit for two

[Verse 1]
Tried to top the chart but they wanna JFK me
Tried to be myself but they wanna AKA me
AKA a shooter AKA a problem
AKA don't hold me back I swear I got 'em
We pulled up in Gucci dripped down in Gabbana
Bad as your mama, racked up like Rihanna
I need me a side chick, hold the drama
I need me a shooter he gon' hold the line up

[Chorus]
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma

[Refrain]
I can't cop the coupe don't do shit for two
All black trucks shooters out the roof
Boy you better duck don't know what to do
I can't cop the coupe don't do shit for two

[Verse 2]
I got way too many people all my niggas equal
If my life was like a movie I'd need 50 sequels
I need 60 bad bitches actin' like they single
Man blowin' up that line while he tryna keep you

[Chorus]
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma

[Bridge]
Don't want no drama drama
Ooh, you don't want no drama drama drama
Don't want no drama drama
Ooh, you don't want no drama drama drama
Don't want no drama drama
Ooh, you don't want no drama drama drama
Don't want no drama drama
Ooh, you don't want no drama drama

[Chorus]
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma
Don't want no drama-ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama-ma

[Outro]
Don't want no
Don't want no drama-ma
Yeah, no no no
Don't need no, don't want no
Don't want no
