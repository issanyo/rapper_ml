[Verse 1: Quavo]
Geeked up in the Beamer
Swerving past Philips Arena
Jewelry sick, got the measles
Pull up on T’s for a teaspoon
Pop a perky for a fever
Cookie got me having weasels
I gave a bitch amnesia
I bought my Rolex from a freezer
Make my wrist have a seizure
My hoe she so cold, no Keisha
Pop a Molly ‘cause I need her
I told my ho it’s geek season
Take a Xan on a flight
Waking up in the midnight
Hit the Hen, we ‘bout to fight
Smoke a blunt, we gonna ride tonight
I’m geeking, I’m stuck like a fire hydrant
I’m sweating, I think I’m dehydrated
Give me the blunt, nigga I light it
You complaining just like a lil cry baby
Pour a four of Act, it’s tasting amazing
When I pop a molly I might get you pregnant
I’m having seals like I'm part of the Navy
I’m a drug analyst, Quavo Skip Bayless

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
They like to call me lil dope fiend
I’m addicted to codeine
I like to smoke out the Backwoods
We ‘bout to roll up some more weed
After I fuck on this lil bitty bitch, she gon’ need her a new weave
I picture so dirty, I’m on morphine
We poppin’ pills like it’s protein
I can’t get caught with no thot
I fuck and I’m kicking her out
I let her boot up on the molly
Now she got dick in her mouth
My cup is so dirty and I’m popping Xans
You don’t get high, you don’t understand
You know I’m gon’ lie if I’m on the stand
I be getting high with my lady friend
I can’t even keep my composure
I mix that lean with my sodas
I text a bitch to come over
I be too high to roll over
We gon’ hot box in a rover
No you can’t lean on my shoulder
I was so high when we talked ‘bout what we talked ‘bout
I forgot what I told ya

[Verse 3: Offset]
I don’t want to admit to the dope that I sell
I’m scared of the feds and I’m scared you might tell
Got bricks stashed up in the trunk in my Chevelle
Dope on my scale, this the story I tell
I got some shooters, kaka out they rugers
Addicted to trappin’ like why fuck with roofies?
Light up the gas and the air gets polluted
Rollin’ rollin’ with the yellow diamonds like I looted
I was 17, made a rack off that dope
When I was 19, made a knot from a fork
20 years old, seen my granddaddy snort
When you serving that blow people turn into ghosts
That’s that good dope, call it [?]
Scraping that pot, scrape that pot, I get in them
I trap that boy and that girl, different genders
I got them chicken biscuits, Mrs. Winters
Ran off with his pack, I told him come get it
When I get to trapping, I’m focused, committed
I’m a drug addict, I hate to admit it
My diamonds from Elliot, not talking Missy
Neighborhood crips in the VIP with me, Nipsey
Pussy boy, bombaclot, heard you was hissy
My plug from out of town, he not from the city
He come in once a month and drop off a ticket
