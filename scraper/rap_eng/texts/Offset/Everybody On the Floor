[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo! Yeah, it's Migos and Game in the club, nigga
Order up a whole dub, nigga, if you're broke I can't fuck with yah
No way! Broke nigga, only real niggas in my section
Thank the Lord for my blessings, I'm drippin' dab, salad dressing
When I'm in LA I feel like Blake Griffin
Shout out to my trap, niggas in the kitchen
You came in with your bitch, now you say she missin' (where?)
QC the label and we independent, Quavo the lieutenant
Look up in the air, it's a money shower
Look down at my Rollie, can't tell the hour
My diamonds so wet, think I need a towel
I'm trappin' a bomb like the Twin Towers
When you get money, it come with the power
Young nigga came from havin' the sour
3 hoes in the shower
Beat it, I kill it, call me Michael Myers

[Hook: Quavo]
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
All this money on the floor
Money! Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
50 thousand on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Fuck up some money some more
In the club spillin' Actavis all on my Louboutin toe
Young Rich Nation that's the clothing
Young nigga run up a check like Usain Bolt
My wrist spinnin' in the pot like a merry go
I got the game in the walls of Jericho
You niggas rookies and I'm a professional
Roll up a Backwood and stuff it with cookie dough
Hop out the Bentley, Young Rich Nation
Diamonds dancin' soon as a nigga hit the door
Throwing up money like a coin toss
I bet the bitches go in and hit the floor
My niggas, they dogs and they bark like chico
Went to Puerto Rico, plug name Enriquo
It's my way, my nigga, but no Carlito
Niggas try to bite the swag and I'ma take it back like repo
We put that flow in the industry
You niggas know and you better remember me
I hear y'all bitch ass niggas gossipin'
Just call me Elmo cause y'all niggas tickle me
All these diamonds look refrigerated
It costs 30 thousand just to look at me
Drinkin' Actavis, I put a pint off in a can
Now we call that oil sheen

[Hook: Quavo]
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
All this money on the floor
Money! Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
5 thousand on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor

[Verse 3: Game]
Used to get my chickens from Tijuana
So I been fucking with the Migos
Yeah nigga it’s killing season, I’m paid in full, I’m rico
They tryna hit me with the R.I.C.O, but I’m lowkey with them kilos
That 8-Ball's fat as Cee-Lo ‘til they barged in like Chico
They ain’t find shit but Nemo, had to take a break like free throws
You ain’t get your dick sucked today, that’s no neck, Benzino
Left eye in that peephole, got me sipping all on this Clicquot
Niggas feel they Debo, put the Glock nine in your ego
Yeah I grew up whipping the baking soda
Had to shave an onion just to make my quota
I was playing ball, knocked out a cop
Can’t talk about it ‘cause the case is open
Business a game ‘til the rape is open
Two desert Eagles, that’s chain smoking
Yeah, niggas bark like niggas hard
But wanna sue a nigga when his face swollen
Hammer on 'em,  too legit, Maserati with the kit
I got 20-20 vision, I see diamonds on my wrist
I see mami with the shit, and she pop it while she strip
Everybody taking shots, I’m 2Pac up on the strip, nigga

[Hook: Quavo]
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
All this money on the floor
Money! Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Fuck up some money some more
I'm all in the club with your ho
Bad bitches on the pole
50 thousand on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
Everybody on the floor
