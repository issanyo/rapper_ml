[Hook : Skippa Da Flippa]
QC the label, and we independent
Got some young niggas still kickin' doors and some of my niggas convicted
Money, money, power, respect, I guess I'm addicted
Money, power, ammunition, guess I'm addicted

[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Quavo!
Whoa, Addicted to the money, man
Ugh! Touch down on the plug for a hundred bands
Make the work flip like its gymnastics
Cartwheel or a handstand
They calling my spatula acrobat
I'm turning a brick to a platinum plaque
You put too much dope on that fishscale
My pockets is deeper than water wells
Plug on the border, got ships on the water
They stuffing the bricks in Beluga Whales
Young nigga just Giuseppe walkin'
House in Miami I'm kicking shit with the Dolphins
You hard on the web call him Peter Parker
Stuffed crust smoking Nikki Parker (Gas)
Gone!

[Verse 2 : Skippa Da Flippa]
Money on the table
QC been the label
Not telling no fables
Ten times ten like a nigga in school doing time tables
Trappin, got flavors
Bando no cable (bando no cable?)
Travelling country to country
Skipping a stable, I'm whippin Mrs. Mabel
Whip the beat go cop the spyder
?? Velvet snyder
Hit my brother Duke, thats my L.A. Dodger
Fuck you impostors, check your posture
We don't rock with coppers, free west and ?

[Verse 3 : Takeoff]
QC the label
Money we makin, without a major
Ain't signing a contract and selling my soul
Cuz everything glitter ain't gold (it ain't)
Double D told me dont fold
The water so cold your partner gon' turn to a four
Dont trap on the block if you dont belong
Straps in my jeans but I ain't talkin' Girbauds
Box of cocaine on a tractor trailer
Sippin on Activis call me the activator
Terminate you like the Terminator
We at the top of the mountain no elevator
Money, pounds, and ammunition
Me, Flip, and LongWay in the kitchen
The labels they made us ridiculous
Cuz QC we independent

[Verse 4 : MPA Duke]
Solid Foundation
QC the label
On the rotation
Keep god in your prayers
Just a millionaire in that sports coupe you lookin at
Gadgets on the Aston stoppin traffic I'm a space cadet
Came from nothin, took a lot of shit
Die by my respect
Ammunition, we got plenty
FNn's, Ak's and fifties
Baby chopper, clip longer than a toddler
I never been a lame, never had a bitch called me Rodger

[Verse 5 : Offset]
Yes I'm Addicted to Benjamins
Gator, my loafers Amphibians
Young nigga, I'm rich, I got MnMs
Ain't making no noise, I ain't heard of him
Your bitch wanna fuck cuz she see the diamonds
Stevie wonder, my VV's, I know they blinding
Hundred chains on my neck look like Busta Rhymes
I got out of jail to a goldmine
For you niggas that bustin my choppa gon bust
And gon hit em, gon flip em, gon make a concussion
Offset a Migo, my plug is amigo
He sendin me kilos, I fuck with Carlito
The pounds, them ounces, them grams
I'm selling the molly santan?
Brokanese niggas I dont understand
Karate chop a brick like I'm in Japan
Wrappin a brick in Saran
