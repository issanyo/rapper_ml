This one goes out to this one person who hurt me and one who didn’t and I guess it’s my fault but I only had hope but just listen and I just want yall to understand where I’m coming from

Look I know it’s my fault and it isn’t know joke but u got to understand that he was my man and now you took the only guy who treated me right even though you love him as well nothing can’t beat mine and his love for each other it’s been for 3 years and now imp in all these tears I just want  to cry and cry because I know imp not like you I know I isn’t pretty and I isn’t got what u got and I isn’t got the looks and got the fancy things in life I just want him to see who I am but I can’t because your standing in my way taking his breath away now I can’t even say hi I just want to die it isn’t no lie that you is the popular one the everything a guy wants but I’m sorry I isn’t gonna give up I kno I had the chance but I never took it but now it’s my turn to shine my turn to get him my turn to be the one who doesn’t need or want everything in life I just want it all to be a surprise ya know so listen get out of my way your distracting me with all this stress and depression how about I return the favour nah I ain't you to be honest I ain't shady ima just keep my head held high and my ten toes down getting my man back that’s my main goal so just make it easier for yourself and leave him alone do something nwith yourself and stop taking other peoples men you gotta understand we all hate hoes so you should just go
