[Verse 1: Offset]
Since day one I was raised in the trenches
Yee ain't have a sack, then you had to go get it
Since day one my daddy was a chemist
Whip whip whip whip whippin in the kitchen
I pull up in the lamb wit the engine in the trunk
Pull out the choppa, made them niggas start to crunk
I got the white man money, call me Donald Trump
Lean got me slowin' down, like a speed bump
Coolin' on the beach, yeah i got my feet up
Birds in the trunk, singin' like Aliyah
She cookin' like a baker but she not Anita
Make alot of money, so nigga need her
Treat her like a dog, way a nigga feed her
Playin with the racks, don't call me Venus
I keep the O like Gilbert 'Renas
I bring them hoes out, nigga like subpoenas

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I finess the plug then hit the mall, I bought the Bally's on the first day
I pop bottles then threw money, I smashed her on the first day
I call the plug, he wrap it up, I picked it up on a Thursday
I bought ya bitch, then splurged on her, now she think it's her birthday
Got young goons put the gloves on, they murkin' niggas its a cold case
I'm runnin' to the money like a track meet, you last, nigga, and I'm first place
I flip the work like a pancake, playin' with the money like Patty Cake
Beatin' up the work like Anna Mae
Got a dope tester with the ashy face

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Since day one, strapped up with two Glocks
In the kitchen whippin', three babies in the pot
Young nigga foe workin' with the 45
[?]
Got a Chevrolet sittin' on 28s
Just cut a 9, and I set it on my waist
Got 10 birds and they singin' in the cage
And I got stripes, call me Jam Master Jay
Got a patch trippin' on the boulevard
My bitch an immigrant she need a green card
I'm a boss so I got a black card
But I don't use it, gotta use my face card
In the kitchen whippin' up soft
I know how to make it hard
Yall fuck nigga tell me how y'all bein' soft
