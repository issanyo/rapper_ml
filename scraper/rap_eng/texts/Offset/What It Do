[Verse 1: Quavo]
What it do? what it do? what it do? I'm sayin' (I'm sayin')
Young nigga, I ain't even complainin' (nah)
Hop out the Lam and I'm sprayin' (skrt)
Put a bad bitch on santan (woo)
What it do, way from Japan (ayy)
White ho with a suntan (white)
Switch lanes like a nigga switch hands (switch)
What it do? what it do? what it do? what it do? what it do?
Nose dive in the blue lagoon (splash)
Vacation with all of my goons (yeah)
Drip right down to the shoes (yeah)
Nigga ain't down with the moves (nah)
Nigga might as well switch crews (yeah)
Straight up, pull up

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What I done did
At the top like a motherfuckin' wig (at the top)
Pass a hundred dollar bill to the kids (to the kids)
Take a watch off and throw it in the fridge
Pick your main thang up and take her to the crib (crib)
Fourteen when I got my first steel
And a nigga still walkin' with the steel still (still)
What it do? what it do?  what it do Quay?
Back to back, think it's a relay
What it do? what it do?  what it do Set?
Maybach six ain't drop yet (ain't out yet)
Actin' hard but you ain't like that (like that)
Try my dogs and I be they bite back (arr)
We don't think about it 'cause we bought that (bought that)
Nah we don't care about the price tag (fuck it)
What it do? who are you? real diamonds, your shit fool (shit fake)
You the one that posts pics on the Gram (you the one)
And goin' up actin' like it's brand new (and it ain't)
Uh-huh, is that true? wait hold up, is that you? (got to)
Amiri jeans but I used to wear Trues (used to)
What it do? what it do?

[Chorus: Quavo]
What it do Take? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do Set? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do Quay? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do? what it do? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do?

[Verse 3: Offset]
I got white where there ain't none fool (white)
I see the racks like it's deja vu (I see the racks)
I'm buying pints, I ain't drinkin' for the cool (lean)
Having rank and the bankroll too (rank)
You ain't never seen the facts on the move (you ain't never)
Called me dumb when we dropped out of school (called me dumb)
Lake view with Jacuzzi and a pool (lake view)
All the pain in the game made me lose it (lost it)
Spikes in the toe with the Loub (spike that)
Pipe on a bitch, tell her lose it (pipe up)
What it do Take? what it do Quay? (what it do?)
We the culture, yeah we the new wave (wave)
You at the top of the game nigga, who safe? (who?)
I'm in a drop Mulsanne on a Tuesday (skrt)
Bring the marble, got the water on every day (woo)
Clear diamonds on a nigga like a 4K (clear)
You got shot with a stick for your ho ways (brrt)
Still drippin' on a bitch in Dolce, yeah
Bricks in the loft with Jose, yeah
Dick in her mouth like Colgate, yeah
Selling rocks 101, runway (101)
Brrt, brrt, you can get the gunplay

[Chorus: Quavo]
What it do Take? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do Set? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do Quay? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do? what it do? what it do?
What it do? what it do? what it do?
