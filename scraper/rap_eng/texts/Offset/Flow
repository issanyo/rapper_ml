[Verse 1 : Rich Homie Quan]
Heard I got a house in and a couple acres, burning down the house just got off probation
Kush blunt blowin, keep em in rotation, hunnid thousand one make a bitch go crazy
Better watch your tongue you know a nigga can't save you
Just got bond, u ain't know a nigga made it, same night to same flake the night I got paid
Did a lil show 50,000 down on the stage, heard a fuck nigga wanna feature gotta wait
You say I wasn't eating , but u still ain't gotta plate
$10,00 mink got a nigga like aye, titanium  sink. got fish In a tank
Rollin up weed ,fillin  up my bank, told the bitch to leave cover up my name
I know she don't see it, it don't draw alot of pain, better pray your shooter got aim
Cause this gun I'm bustin' got a body on it, and I ain't gotta  bust I got a lot of homies
And I been geekin' all day that nigga scottie on it, I probably   somewhere wit a bitch
Wit a lot of money, amd I got a rifle on me , got it on ???
Like I got a diaper  on me ,I know I'm a minor , she said she wanna see the house
So I give it a tour, don't give it a most , I give it amour

[Verse 2 : Offset]
Me and young rich homie got money in the shoe box, choppa  red Dots on your your body
Like chicken pox screaming for my enemies feeling like 2Pac
Offset a classic like I was wit rebok, Young rich homie the hashtag, we pullin  the drop like hash back
You niggas, is ducks like Aflac twenty 14 sellin 80 crack.  Giuseppe stepper, black and white diamonds
Salt n peppa, Me and Quan goin  in wit no effort,  Louie  shoes come and play checkers
Step on you niggas like welcome matts, Smokin Keisha Cole heart attack
We makin hits Derrick Jeter back. You payin  these bitches  to lick the cat
The difference between me you and quan, We got 50 acres worth of lawn
But we all grew up in the fuckin slums. Fuck nigga pussy boy  bumm. Why is the Kush smellin  like underarm
Why is yo bitch keep lickin  my charms. Why the fuck you ain't got no damn arm.  Dope 50 hunnid
I trap all the country, got a Banana  clip for all of the month.Zebra Louboutins
Call it jumonji, money long, longer then bungee '
Hehehe you funny
