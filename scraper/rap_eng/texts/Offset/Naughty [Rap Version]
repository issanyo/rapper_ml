[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Verse 1]
I've been a good girl
I've been a good girl all week long
I've been a good girl
I've been a good girl, don't make me wait so long
Baby, I'ma do it how I do it, don't trip
You know, that I don't see no other, I'll be ridin' it for life
You and I, you and I
Baby, all night

[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you let me pour a drink?
Let me pour a drink all over my body
Let me do a dance, let me do a dance, that you like
Baby, let me be naughty

[Chorus]
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Let me be naughty
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're my boss, you're my boss, you're my boss
You're my baby, I'm your lady, I'm your lady tonight
And I'ma show you, how I'ma do you right
I'ma do whatever, do whatever you like

[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you let me pour a drink?
Let me pour a drink all over my body
Let me do a dance, let me do a dance, that you like
Baby, let me be naughty

[Chorus]
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Let me be naughty
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?

Won't you let me be naughty?
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna be naughty
Won't you let me be naughty?
