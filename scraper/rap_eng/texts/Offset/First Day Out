[Intro: Offset]
Offset!
Got out of jail again, and again, and again

[Chorus: Offset]
I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be demented
I got niggas serving bricks out the fender
That Karma keep coming back when I was getting it
A lot of you niggas be changing when you get famous
Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they 'bout it 'bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texacos
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Had to understand I had to sacrifice
I was living life I had to pay the price
Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back it's like I hit the lottery
For my fans I gotta say apologies
They holding me down and they ride for me

[Verse 1: Offset]
A hundred thousand for a Plain Jane
When you locked up, got to maintain
Caught a Fed case with the cocaine
Start telling names, playing blame games
That ain't the shit that I call a hunna
I was the boss and you was the runner
I cooked the dope while she count the commas
If she run with the money I kill her momma
Do you really fuck with me? Sometimes I wonder
What was you at when that drought was coming
You be bumping your gums but ain't saying nothing
Got your bitch in the condo we have a slumber
I might pull up with a hundred bricks in a Hummer
I can not tell cause the code that I honour
I know one nigga who came from the jungle
He told me get money, don't want nothing from you

[Chorus: Offset]
I can never fold on none of my niggas
I'm the one they talk about be demented
I got niggas serving bricks out the fender
That Karma keep coming back when I was getting it
A lot of you niggas be changing when you get famous
Talking that shit but you really not gangster
These niggas claiming that they 'bout it 'bout it
We pull them choppers out and homicide them
We used to trap up at the Texacos
Never sold my soul I had to take the blow
Had to understand I had to sacrifice
I was living life I had to pay the price
Lost everything I had like Solomon
Got it back it's like I hit the lottery
For my fans I gotta say apologies
They holding me down and they ride for me
