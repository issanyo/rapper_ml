[Verse 1: Offset]
Take a seat, take seat, lil' mama don't even talk to me (shh)
I'm blessed to see the diamond jewelry (blessed)
Crawlin’ in the coupe centipede (skrt)
No you niggas can't get rid of me (no)
I can't fuck with that negative energy (negative)
Pistol Pete so many memories (Pistol)
We took a loss in the penalty (loss)
Dynasty puzzle piece, everybody play accordingly (according)
80K can’t afford me (no)
Louie loafers cost a quarter P (Louie)
Aye, fuck all the shit (fuck it)
I'm bout to empty the clip (rah, rah, rah)
I'm 'bout to pour up a seal (mud)
I make the Lamb' do a cartwheel (skrt)

She wanna sniff on the bills (sniff)
I don't treat 'em no different (no)
You live how you live (live)
I'm a player, I'm pimpin' (player)
Don't worry about what I'm sippin' (mud)
It's dirty, it's filthy (filthy)
Walkin' around with a fifty (fifty)

[Verse 2: Sauce Walka]
Hop in the 'Rari and ride, I got the bitch on my side, yeah, yeah
I had to drip to get mine that is the reason I shine, yeah, yeah
I swear, I swear I'm tryna tell you
They wanted me to fall but I still ball
Wizard like John Wall
Valet my foreign's at malls
Honey buns tall
I ain't had nothing at all
I gave my daddy [?]
Hop in the 'Rari and splash off
500 in the stashhouse
New mansion, [?] glass house
Pool in the back, girls ass out
I'm livin' my life is stylish
The girls goin' wild [?]
They ain't wanna see me smile at them
So I gotta make them frown again

[Chorus: Offset]
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt)
Cut the top off I'ma ride (hey)
Look at the door, suicide (suicide)
She wanna hop in the ride (ride)
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt, ooh, skrt)
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt, ooh, skrt)
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt)
Wipin' my momma eyes (momma)
I got a million now (million)
Take care of my children now (my children)
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt, ooh, skrt)
Hop in the Lamb' and ride (skrt, skrt)
