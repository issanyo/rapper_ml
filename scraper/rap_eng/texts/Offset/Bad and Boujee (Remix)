If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot ya'
Hey!

[Hook: Offset]

Raindrop (drip), drop top (drop top)
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (cookie)
Fuckin' on your bitch, she a thot, thot (thot)
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot (pot)
We came from nothin' to somethin', nigga (hey)
I don't trust nobody, grip the trigger (nobody)
Call up the gang and they come and get ya (gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (hey)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (blaow)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (savage)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (grrah)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with a Uzi (dope)
My niggas is savage, ruthless (hey)
We got 30's and 100 rounds too (glah)

[Verse 1: CJ White]

Yo it's CJ, bitch, so what the fuck is up
Hangin' out in these streets and I got big fuckin' nuts
Used to live in Yasamal, now in Xırdalan
We keepin' it real here unlike your plastic clan
If I told you 'bout the robberies you would think I was lyin'
Youngest homies 14 talkin' bout how they bangin'
If you lame or a rake you get wasted
You wanna get bullied, nia, yeah, here's the place, it is
You wanna fight, nia, we can get more brutal
Dear parents, we are not good and safe for your children
They haven't seen nothing, they have bright faces
You wanna show-off, nia, here is not the place to
More ounce to the pounds cuz the indo the shit
I done got me 50 ounces and then cum in this bitch
With the homies from the hood we smoke multi
And then sex till the morning till you see she's kinda ugly

[Verse 2]

Just released the first album nia tryna sell it
But no business without commercial so he couldn't make it
At the studio for album, man, I wish I could fly
I gotta wake up early cuz I need money supply
And the playaz from my city are Gz, man
When we get shot we bleed no "cheese", man
Bitch niaz say they got hunnid grand
You're no one without money in your hand
City of Xırdalan, yeah, that's where I stay
Facin' goddamn struggle every goddamn day
Big paper I'll be foldin'
Hoes be on my muthafuckin' dick for all the money I'll be holdin'
I hate when clown men show it
Especially them fools did nothing to earn it but blessed with it
Keep it real, stay low-key and you best not trip
If you start to talkin' shit my nigga empty the clip
