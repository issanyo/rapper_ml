[Verse 1: Drake & Quavo]
Yeah! Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song (Migo!)
Damn!

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes (stripes!)
Like Olympics got gold medal (gold!)
But none of that means nothin' to me (no!)
I'm celebratin' with my family (woo!)
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy (grammy!)
I—I want a Grammy (uh!)
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy (grammy!)
I—I want a Grammy (go!) (woo!)
In the hood, you earn your stripes (stripes!)
Like Olympics got gold medal (gold!)
But none of that means nothin' to me (no!)
I'm celebratin' with my family (QC!)
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy (woo!)
I—I want a Grammy (Grammy!)
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy (woo!)
I—I want a Grammy (go!)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Quavo! Brr!
Js, they callin' my phone, they tyin' my line (Js!) (brr!)
Labels, they callin' my phone, I don't wanna sign (no!)
They sayin' we made our own million dollars (M&Ms!)
At the top right now, I wanna order up a million bottles (woo!)
We came from juug in the Impala to smashin' them models (juug!) (smash!)
We independent, we don't need none of your major dollars (QC!) (go!)

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Flippin' and whippin' and spinnin' the dope
I'm hittin' the door
I wrap it in package, I'm shippin' the dope
Run off with the the dope, I'm killin' that ho!
I'm takin' a trip to the Bahamas, going to pick up them commas
And when I touchdown I'll hop in a Zonda
Smokin' on good marijuana in Mexico, call that quintana
Tryna fuck me a Rihanna
Comin' up, just me and Benji
Get rich or die try' like I'm 50
No cupid them bitches be kissin'
The feds they listen, them bricks in the kitchen!

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy

[Verse 4: Offset]
Sellin' a Grammy like Tony (Montana!)
Now I want Grammys and ceremonies
These niggas snakin', always actin' funny
Got the MAC-11, call it macaroni
Always gettin' trophies and recreation
QC the label, the solid foundation
Sittin' at home I was contemplating
Changing and switch up my situation
Tryna see the bigger picture
Pull up to the award show in my new Fisker
No it ain't no money issue
Grant all my momma's wishes
Watchin' her son on the channel
I won me a Grammy and mansion, I want me a Phantom
My nigga we next up, these niggas
They copy the swag, but no they not better than us

[Chorus: Quavo]
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
In the hood, you earn your stripes
Like Olympics got gold medal
But none of that means nothin' to me
I'm celebratin' with my family
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy
I—I want a Grammy
