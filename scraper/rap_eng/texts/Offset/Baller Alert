[Intro: Quavo + Kevin Hart]
We know game

Y'all thought, y'all thought we was a game, bitch

[Pre-Hook: Quavo + Kevin Hart]
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
We know game
Oh this it
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
Ball player shit, ladies, we 'bout to give up your plan
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit

[Chorus: Quavo]
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Gotta make sure that my chains go with all my clothes
Gotta make sure that my cars match all my clothes
(Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt)
With the Draco
Quavo huncho can go places that you can’t go
So traditional
Keep the same bowls, same stove, that’s the way it go
Ain’t this what you here for? (hold up, hold up, wait)
Now they say they want that Migo flow
Talk about bands and Kilos
Talk about break it down reload
Talk about re-up and re-up (re-up)
Talk about gassin' your Jeep up (vroom)
Talking bout backin' that Jeep up (beep)
Talking bout fallin' and gettin' up (ay)
My pockets they doing sit-ups (sit-ups)
I be right back, got a pick-up (poof)
They say it's cheaper to leave em (cheaper)
Baller alert on my beeper (verrrrp)
Cappin’ is cheaper (cappin’)
Leave it to Beaver (leave it to B)
OG like Kobe (OG)
OG like Jeter (I’m a OG)
I ring your block (run it like who?)
Quavo A Peterson

[Chorus: Quavo]
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Flexin' my athleticism
They ought to show this shit on television
Atlanta Falcon hoodie bomber
Your girl, she tryna get under my Under Armour
Kick it pimpin,’ no extra points
They invitation, no hesitation
She accept to make it to my celebration
See I'm ballin' hard with no sport agent
Need free agent, at least three, maybe four
Hit yo city lit everywhere we go
Throw it, I’ma make the catch incredible
Like Brandon Marshall
A coffee colored shawty with me everywhere
Ask me do I run it, hell yeah
Drippin' sauce all over everything
I’m a real king, you a lil something
Boy, don’t make me pull the rings out the vault
I be showin' off and ain’t even gotta talk
Shawty let me hit the hole like Marshall Faulk
Or maybe Barry Sanders
Got some cheerleaders, no love handles, okay
Ain’t nothin' really, you betta MVP me, Von Miller
Quick as Cam Newton, Superman jukin'
Poppin’ champagne at the pro game
When I told them I'ma win the whole thing
It ain’t no thing (hey)
Baby, champion is my first name ya

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
We know game
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
Ball player shit, ball, ball player shit
We know game

[Chorus: Quavo]
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert
Baller alert, baller alert

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Gotta keep the Draco because this world cold
The streets a PS4, I know the cheat code
Gotta make sure that those rose match my Apple bros
Gotta make sure that my wardrobe matches with all my hoes
Tell that boy to stop acting bold before I wipe his nose
I love the kitchen so much went and bought a stove

[Verse 4: Offset]
Go buy that lil bitch a purse
Ballin' that shit don’t even hurt (ball)
Pull up a Maybach or Hearse (Maybach)
Go back and do your research (research)
You cuff her I put her to work (working her)
Call me a Lamb I skirt (skirt)
Ballin' like Kendrick Perk
Then I pop a half of a perc
Wraith, Wraith, Wraith, Wraith
Look at the way that they hate
We know the game like Peyton (We know the game)
Fuck her don’t come to the date
I took an eighth to the face (eighth)
I caught an arsenics case (case)
Because there is a bomb in my safe (boom)
Diamonds that hit the bitch face (whoa)
She feel like she done got maced

[Chorus: Quavo]
Baller alert
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (Ball player)
Baller alert (oh)
We know game

[Outro: Kevin Hart]
You've been alerted! You've been alerted, bitch! Brrrrp, brrrrp! Is that a bird or is that one of them chirp alarms? I don't know which one... Brrrrp, brrrrp! Cause that could be an alarm too! It don't have to be a bird... I'm just lookin' for clarity on my side. Either way, we fine. Either way... the message is... the message has been given! Baller alert, brrrrp, brrrp!! Or... or... git, git, git! The question is: What now?
