[Verse 2: Offset]
Young nigga playing with the guala
Running to the sack like Polamalu
I got commas on the come up
Your bitch she fuck with my pimping
You mad, your pockets on empty
I'm whipping up, cooking up Kimberley
My diamonds gon' make you remember me
Young rich nigga
You ain't know nothing bout it, pull up in a Audi
Sipping on violet, my bitch from the tropics
I'm selling narcotics, putting your bitch onto molly
Sucking and licking me like I'm a jolly rancher
You niggas amateur
Run to the money, I got so much stamina
Making a movie without no camera
Offset the truth, I pull in the coupe, subtracting the roof
Bitches they come out the group, smoking on gas like I'm Snoop
Real nigga salute, you niggas ain't making no noise, you niggas on mute
You a square from Delaware, my bitches got long hair
They cooking the dope with no underwear

I got a check
I'm in Magic City, fucking up a check
We some young niggas fucking up the city
You owe me money, send my young ho to come get
That cash hanging out my pocket, dope boy with a rocket
You know I'm in love with violence, I be up in that bitch on Friday
Got a young ho be on that molly, but she know she 'bout that profit
And a young nigga gotta stay private, cus' you know these niggas out here watching
All hunnits, no twenties
Eating good, no Wendy's
I smash her, and I finish
Li'l coupe, be easy
Young nigga playing, young nigga got them bands
Pull up to the hood in a space ship
Fuck around and [?]
