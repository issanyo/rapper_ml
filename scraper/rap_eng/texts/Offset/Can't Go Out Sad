[Intro: Quavo]
Yeah
Talk to me
See this day and age, these young niggas getting paid

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Wrist clear, Sprite, yuh
Mike Tyson bite, yuh
Cup real dirty, yuh
Motocross bike, yuh
We don't fist fight
Chopper real light
Double seal tight
This drank got me right
Piccolo green it's millions, and the old money got mildew
Kick her out 'cause she keep filming
They calling me Bob the Builder
Quavo Paul Pierce em', whip a ball, Wilson
Put my all in that bowl, put my all in it
I want all my dogs to win it
I want all my dogs to win it
Remember my dog was sentenced
No, no, I ain't gon' take it back to the beginning
Just get in the Benz and sit in
(Talk to em'!)
C'mon (Ay!)
(Get in there!)
(Chill!)
(C'mon!)
Standing in the trap, been a long day
Thinking bout putting insurance on my wrist and AK
Mama tired, daddy died, ain't no Real Housewives
Now it's no more crying 'cause we upper echelon
I can make a Tuesday, go up like a Saturday
I don't play where you fools play, you must be from out of state
Molly your girl dinner plate, you take her on dinner dates
Dabbing in Raf Simmons, yeah I dress the huncho everyday
Ricki Lake, wrapped up, came from Kuwait
Every day, every day, young nigga looking for bae
Got a bitch on Jimmy and she do whatever huncho say
Her boyfriend wanna be me cause I keep that shit the gangster way

[Refrain: Quavo]
I got to put you down
Ay man, these niggas goin' out sad
I'm tellin' ya, can't go out bad
Naw, 'specially bout that bitch

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm not goin' out sad
I'm not goin' out sad
I'm not goin' out sad
'Specially bout that bitch
I can't go out sad
I can't go out sad
I can't go out sad
'Specially bout that bitch

[Verse 2: Offset]
(Offset!)
Not 'bout the bitch, naw, not 'bout the bitch
She call just for the dick
Aw, lord, don't say this your bitch
I'm young and rich
But I can strong arm a brick
I heard you was born a bitch
Rick Owens, they cost your rent
Pay up, straight up
Told John Wic got to pick the K up
I'ma smash ya but we don't lay up
I'm a bachelor, get ya weight up
From the nawf, bitch you know where we from
Think it's sweet and we pull out a drum
You can be rich and a bum
I want it all, not some
She fucking for fame, for some'
I think she came for money
I swear I ain't hurting for nothing
So I just gave her the money
Hoes in my house like Hugh Heffner
But I'mma slay the bunnies
She goin' insane, she talk' bout my main
Quit sayin' my name lil' mama

[Refrain: Quavo]
I got to put you down
Ay man, these niggas goin' out sad
I'm tellin' ya, can't go out bad
Naw, 'specially bout that bitch

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm not goin' out sad
I'm not goin' out sad
I'm not goin' out sad
'Specially bout that bitch
I can't go out sad
I can't go out sad
I can't go out sad
'Specially bout that bitch

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
(Takeoff!)
I can't, go out, sad about no bitch
Who me? Takeoff never mad about no bitch
Depressed, need to get some' off my chest
Ain't stressed about that bitch
She let, me nut on her chest, you still arrest that bitch
Bad, yeah lil' mama bad, you let her get the Jag and crash
That's goin' out sad
You took on her on a date with dad
The question is boy did you smash?
Been strong a week and a half
And everything you get to give that bitch half (tricked you)
Aw man, goddamn, these niggas goin' out sad
Wifin' ho's up, there's not one nigga the hood done been had
Smash, cuff, but you can pass, ignore but can't erase the past
She fool you once, shame on her, if she fool you twice it's yo ass

[Refrain: Quavo]
I got to put you down
Ay man, these niggas goin' out sad
I'm tellin' ya, can't go out bad
Naw, 'specially bout that bitch

[Hook: Quavo]
I'm not goin' out sad
