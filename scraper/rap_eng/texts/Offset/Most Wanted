[Intro]
Tryna get through
Smokin' rapper fuck
Do right get you some sacks

[Hook: Lil Duke]
All of my whole life I been waiting on this moment
And why the hell you rented something so cheap
You coulda owned it
And my niggas got felonies man all them niggas wanted
I could take on whatever in front of me show me my opponent
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
They posting my face up on corners, Americas Most Wanted
I'm ready to take my opponent
Trappin' the pack on the corner (og gas)
Most of my niggas we felons for intent to distribute them onions we workin our bag
Keepin' it blue crippin' trap with the rag
Americas most wanted for trap and dab
Dope in my Rollie leaving out that lab
Got a hand chopper can't wait to use
Arabian bitch pulling up
Make that lil bitch make a movie
Stuff crust up the bitch with 2 gram doobies
Make that bitch spit up loogies
We turnt the on shrooms and [?]
Cavalli my body, moon shades
Longway be kickin' and pimpin' like he from the bay
Forever most wanted, paper cuts thumbin' through hundreds

[Hook: Lil Duke]
All of my whole life I been waiting on this moment
And why the hell you rented something so cheap
You coulda owned it
And my niggas got felonies man all them niggas wanted
I could take on whatever in front of me show me my opponent
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted

[Verse 2: Offset]
How does it feel to be stuck in this situation
When you can't even elevate
My niggas on go they excelerate
A million two cups I'ma celebrate
When I'm droppin the top on the rari
Sippin' Actavis I'm good on Bacardi
Look at the haters through my Cartiers (see ya)
Dab up on that bitch like I'm from Bel Air
I know that you thinkin' that it ain't fair
Because all of my niggas flexin' Ric Flair
You don't want war, I declare
Running through the lobby trappin' broccoli, countin' monopoly
Most of my niggas coming from the poverty
We seen it coming to the opportunity

[Verse 3: Lil Duke]
I know how to whip a whole well
I bought a rock and I don't need a scale
Coming in 50 pounds, the bales
I'm so on point no nail, promethazine with codeine got me movin' snail
I run with big dogs, pussy nigga be well
Now its rollies 40 pointers Vvs's

[Hook: Lil Duke]
All of my whole life I been waiting on this moment
And why the hell you rented something so cheap
You coulda owned it
And my niggas got felonies man all them niggas wanted
I could take on whatever in front of me show me my opponent
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Most wanted, most wanted, most wanted
Americas most wanted
