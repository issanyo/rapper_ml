[Intro: Offset]
Ayy, hey
You know, we gettin' money on these mothafuckers, man
I know what the fuck we talkin' 'bout
I don't know what the fuck y'all niggas doin'
You know what I mean?
Nah for real man

[Hook: Offset + Lil Yachty]
I'm thinkin' about all decisions I made, decisions (woo)
Stack up my money, stack it I'm paid, Benjamins (uh)
Give a fuck 'bout a hater, don't care what they say, I don't care (hey)
Stack up and pray, stack up and pray
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up, stack it up (stack)
Back it up, back it up, back it up
That's an 18 wheeler truck
Beep, beep-beep
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Beep, beep-beep
That's an 18 wheeler truck
Beep, beep-beep
Beep, beep-beep
Beep, beep-beep
Beep, beep-beep

[Verse 1: Offset]
Offset!
Back up, back up, back up, back up
We was grindin' hard tryna get the racks up
Niggas hated on us, niggas laughed on us (laughed)
Now we pullin' up with bags on us (bags)
Pop the seal, pour the Actavis in peach Crush (Act')
Sippin' anything, you get the bubble guts
When the pack come in then my heart get a rush (yeah)
Cause I know I'm 'bout to make a million plus
We be ridin' through the city (ridin')
The bricks get in on Wednesday
You heard she was fuckin' other niggas (damn)
When you cut her off, you run up her ticket (go)
Back up, back up, back up, back up (back up)
I'm a rich nigga, don't act up (rich)
Snakes in the grass, come masked up
Got thirty bricks on the back of the Raptor
Who the fuck said the Migo gang ain't started this? (who)
We planted the seed and made a garden, bitch (yea)
I ain't with the bullshit, I always depart from this (no)
Migo gang, you niggas not a part of it (gang)
Pocket rocket 'case a problem (baow)
Foreign bitches sniffin' powder
The truck gon' be here in an hour (yes)
I'm watchin' my back like an owl

[Hook: Offset + Lil Yachty]
I'm thinkin' about all decisions I made, decisions
Stack up my money, stack it I'm paid, Benjamins
Give a fuck 'bout a hater, don't care what they say, I don't care
Stack up and pray, stack up and pray
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up, stack it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil Boat!
I had to cut a lot of people off
These bitch niggas they soft and they mind was off
Hole in one all of 'em like I'm playin' golf
Gotta get paid, young nigga, like I'm Dolph
22 caliber, this ain't airsoft
Get hit with it if you thinkin' we soft
Nigga run up and try to take my chain
That's the last that you heard of his name
Ain't a shame, bitch I rock 17
Gucci on Gucci, that young nigga clean
Bought up the Nautica sales on my own
Wouldn't be surprised if they called my phone
Wouldn't be surprised if you tried to clone
Up high, bitch I'm fly like a drone
No drugs, did this shit fully sober
Fuck a friend cause some niggas some cobras

[Hook: Offset + Lil Yachty]
I'm thinkin' about all decisions I made, decisions
Stack up my money, stack it I'm paid, Benjamins
Give a fuck 'bout a hater, don't care what they say, I don't care
Stack up and pray, stack up and pray
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up, stack it up
Back it up, back it up, back it up

Beep, beep-beep
Back it up, back it up, back it up
Beep, beep-beep
