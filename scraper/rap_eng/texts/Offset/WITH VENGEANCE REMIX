[Intro]
Aye aye
Aye aye
Happy birthday to Slump God man
Wet
The G.O.A.T
Aye aye aye

[Verse 1]
Beat on the pussy like Little Mac, uh (Mac!)
Why you be runnin', don't you got a strap? (Strap)
Cut all this talkin', cut all of this crap (Crap)
Online you flexin' but I know that's cap (Cap)
Now that boy, he tryna rap (Rap?)
A hole in his head 'cause he wearin' GAP (GAP?)
End his shit, call it a wrap (Wrap)
All this word play, it get you blown back (Back)
But I ain't usin' no gat (Gat)
Feel like Ski Mask 'cause I'm 'boutta snap
Like I be killin' this shit
Like I just took a hit
04/20 tommorow
And I ain't throwin' no fit
Just throwin' punches, Brad Pitt
Swear that your hoe takin' dick (Dick)
Feed her my kids like pills
Paramedic
All this rappin' be givin' you chills
Ice Tray aesthetic ('sthetic)
Hit you like Slipknot
Make you get Prosthetics (Prosthetics)
Bowlex the pussy
Welcome to Slump God's athletics (Athletics)
Hahahah (Hah)

[Chorus]
This is my revenge
My vengeance
My vengeance
My vengeance
My vengeance
My vengeance remix aye bitch

[Verse 2]
With Vengeance, enough mentioned
Call him Lil Quick Scope, call me Intervention (Intervention)
NØ_ØNE on the come up, pay attention (Attention)
All these motherfuckers got twisted intensions (Intensions)
They give me a vibe of hoes with extensions (Extensions)
Correction (Correction)
A vibe of wild homies with extendos
Extendos longer than a jews nose (Nose?)
Should you mess with them? I guess no one knows (Knows)
Weigh the cons and pros (Pros)
But stay on your toes (Toes)
Mr Jones (Jones)
You missed out on this blonde (Ouu)
While lookin' at the chick in a flamenco pose (Pose?)
Imma fly away with her while you Counting Crows (Wha-?)
She the type of chick to stay with you through your highs and lows (Ouu)
From second handed clothes to when your wrist on froze (Froze!)
Like Pump, but I don't fuck with hoes from TV shows (iCarly?)
Peep this but don't overdose
R.I.P. to Gus, leave him a red rose (R.I.P. Gus man)

[Outro]
Ouu
Aye
Aye
Aye
Aye
