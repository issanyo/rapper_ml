[Pre-Hook: Quavo]
I know (I know) you wanna go
I know (I know) you wanna go
Come on, we takin' off
And I know you don't wanna miss this plane

[Hook: Quavo]
Started with a hundred bricks (Bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, bitch (Bitch, bitch)
My mama said, "Stay patient" (Mama, mama)
Hundred bands, I ain't waitin'
I'm figgity figgity fucked up (Fucked up, fucked up)
Boy, you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up (Fucked up, fucked up)
Goddamn, you got me fucked up

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Fill my cup up, damn, you got me fucked up
Every ugly bitch in here they lookin' bad as fuck
She popped a molly, oh, look at her tongue
The bitch that came with me said they want some
Just look at that, Forrest, look at that, Forrest, run
Got pink in my cup, it's not lookin' like just a bubblegum
I'm askin' the bitch what's her name, she tellin' me Cinnamon
I want to put all of my glaze on you like a Cinnabon

Boy, you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up (Fucked up, fucked up)
Goddamn, you got me fucked up

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Lil mama lookin' so gorgeous
She ask me can I afford it
I told her, "Bitch, you got me fucked up"
My Migos chain can pay your mortgage
Twenty-four K on my toilet
Pockets enormous, callin' me Norbit
Take it from Migos, I'm makin' Tostitos illegal, I might get deported
You niggas be trippin', you fucked up
If you thinkin' you gon' catch me slippin'
(KLA! KLA! KLA!)
Leavin' no witness, Grinch comin' through your chimney
I got the Bobby, the Britney, the Iggy
Sorry, I ran outta Whitney
Young nigga, I'm makin' history
Before I die, you gon' remember me

[Pre-Hook: Quavo]
I know (I know) you wanna go

[Verse 3: Offset]
She grindin' her teeth like she hungry
Poppin' the molly, she horny
She talkin' too much, she annoyin'
She givin' out blowjobs, no employment
My diamonds anemic, she sneakin' and geekin'
She said she got a nigga, tell him she cheatin'
It's been a whole weekend, so when are you leavin'?
Just suck on the dick, baby girl, don't be teasin'
My neck is so sick, somebody come and treat it
Migos in the buildin', sold out arenas
Come get yo bitch 'out the session, my nigga
She smokin' up all of the reefer
Leave my two liter, don't do margaritas
This shit that we smokin' is louder than speakers
