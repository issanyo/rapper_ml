[Hook: Quavo]
Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo
She look like a godness, she tell me I'm hottest
I'm touchin' on her, rubbin' Benjamins all over her body
She got a flower in her ear, she look like she came from Hawaii
I'm lookin' right at her, I told her, 'Come here'
She told me she can't wait to pop it
I told her, 'Go pop it all'
Then she told me just wake her, she free tomorrow
No, I cannot go, got a show, 50 K tomorrow
Look at my face, girl, I'm hungry
Hungry, that's meanin' I'm horny
Got 'em on at three or four in the mornin'
Makin' her eggs 8 A.M. in the mornin'
You know that she naked, that's how she came in and made it
Wanna lock her down, wanna lock her down like it's slavery
Black and Asian what a combination
She turnin' me on wit' her conversation

[Hook]
Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation

[Verse 2: Offset]
She said, 'Daddy, come here'
She fell in love and a young nigga hit it
Smackin' her ass and I'm grippin' her titties
Can you handle it after the young nigga handled that?
Roll, roll, yeah, roll
Do not like takin', baby, take it all
You know we just started, this is a long road
Start it, fifty percent in trunk, that's a truckload
Conversations won't be in a Maybach
Conversations wanna temp, baby, lay back
Say say she hungry, I filled her the latex
No, baby, we gotta have safe sex
She so fine and I'm singin' her blues
I'm a beat it, beat it 'til it bruise
I know that she got some potential
Wanna see on your mind, what's your mental?
Lil' mama, I know that she gifted
So I bought her a Bentley on Christmas
Got on Louboutins, she got on Louboutins
I flipped your bitch and I know it's unfortunate
Perfect, heaven-sent, lil' mama got the whole package

[Hook]
Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
