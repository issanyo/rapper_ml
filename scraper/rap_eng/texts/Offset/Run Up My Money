[Intro]
Running up the money
Running up the money
We run to the money like it's a marathon nigga

[Hook: Offset]
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Trapping OG gas pack in the mansion
I got bad bitches in the kitchen dirty dancing
Running up the money [x8]

[Verse 1]
Running up the money
You broke and you looking so hungry
Tiger stripe Giuseppe's looking like Tony
You want the recipe but you cannot clone me
Molly Santana make the bitch wanna dance
I'm fucking your bitch cause your bitch is a fan
My niggas be drumming but this not a band
[?] watch me on demand
Offset [?] I am the man
I knew I was gonna be rich
Used to eat noodles but now I eat shrimp
Sippin' on Actavis high as a blimp
Money, respect and the power
[?] Austin Power
OG gas pack smelling sour
I got more flavors than Nougat
You think it was pancakes cause I be sippin' on maple
Your bitch forehead on my naval
[?] Louie my shoes they gator
No Mike Will but I made her
She a dime but I can't save her
Run to the money Usain Bolt
Molly molly geekin' like Fabo

[Hook: Offset]
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Trapping OG gas pack in the mansion
I got bad bitches in the kitchen dirty dancing
Running up the money [x8]

[Verse 2]
All black Bentley with the Fisker's
My trap filled with babies look like Toys R Us
These bitches must be squirrels cause they chasing us
She get freaky deaky when she lick the molly dust
Whipping the brick like we in forensics
(whipping the brick gymnastics)
Bricks coming in on a boat finesse the plug Tom Ford toes
Hit a nigga in the cannalope
I'm spinning my wrist like merry go
Offset a boss in the [?]
Georgia bulldogs got the .44
I'm number one ain't no competition
Count 100 bands in Versace lint
He talking shit then my young nigga get him
1 shot to the head [?]
Yes I'm a star my plug is a alien coming from mars
(karate chop a brick)
Martial arts
I'm feeling like Pablo Escobar

[Hook: Offset]
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Running up the money I ain't break a sweat
Trapping OG gas pack in the mansion
I got bad bitches in the kitchen dirty dancing
Running up the money [x8]
