100 racks gone when I pull out
Black Corvette when I pull out
Bad foreign bitch when I pull out
VVS dripping when I pull out
100 racks gone when I pull out

Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out
Pull out, pull out, pull out, pull out

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Everybody know I show out, VVS diamonds yeah they glow out
Droptop coupe bring the hoes out
Migo Gang in the building, club sold out
Big packs over here, nigga no drought
Got a 100 stashed at the traphouse
And a 100 stashed at the bando
I'm cooling in my lambo
Ain't gone lie, lil' mama look good
Imma take her to the crib, Migo Gang run through here
I ain't gon' front you no weight lil' cuh
If you some money then maybe I'll do it
Counting up checks, I let her thumb through it
Ya'll just watch how Quavo do it
Went to Saks and spent them stacks
Walked out of there with nothing but Louis

Nigga try me Imma pull out
Fuck a foreign bitch got to pull out
Go to the club, Imma pull out
Foreign bitch, Jimmy Choo's with he toes out
See 12 [?] and we roll out
Got bands on me, pull a pole out
Ice on my neck so its cold out
I fuck with the hood, don't go out
I'm a wild ass nigga like [?]
Light green in my swisher like Kermit
My pockets on fat like Sherman
I'm a preacher nigga, listen to the sermon
Got 50 bricks in the Excursion
In a Maybach, nigga see the curtains
They say my pack Arabian, cocaine wrapped up like a turban

Young nigga man I see your chain, take it off...pull off
Hollows went to deep in your body, now they had to pull off
Got tired of pulling in the club, nigga I'm about to pull out
Got tired of fucking with your girl, nigga I'm about to pull out
We got a show at Echelon, 1 o'clock we gon' pull out
When we pull them benji's out, bad bitches tend to get pulled out
That Audi I don' pulled out, That Masi I don' pulled out
That [?] on everything I pulled out
