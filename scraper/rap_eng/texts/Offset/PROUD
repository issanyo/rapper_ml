[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, do it for the hood, nigga, rep
Yeah, Soufside with an F 'cause I'm fresh
Do it for the hood, nigga, rep
Soufside with an F 'cause I'm fresh
Tryna make my momma proud, uh
I ain't tryna let my momma down (yah)
I'm just tryna make my momma proud, uh
I ain't fuckin' 'round with you (uh, uh, uh)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
T.R.U. University, I pull it up and murk a beat
Momma house was filled up with bags of Hercules (strong)
Soon as I finished pissin', I put the seat down
Or my momma'd be cussin' my damn ass out
Only child, no siblings, no besties
I couldn't do nothin' right like a lefty (woo)
Bought my momma's first house with the juug money (alright)
Bought my momma's second house with the club money (show)
Me and momma used to trap out the same house (same house)
Used to eat and go to sleep on the same couch (same couch)
Me and momma got busted at the same time (same time)
Went to court and told judge the damn same lies (same lies)
I can tell momma proud of her only son
2 Chainz, I have always worn more than one
Yeah I'm real, I'm ill, you know, you gotta feel
You poppin' pills, I'm rarer than two dollar bills

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud (make my momma proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud, yeah (proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, momma ain't raise no ho, one more time
Yeah, my momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho

[Verse 2: YG]
4Hunnid! My momma ain't raise no ho (no ho)
'Cause my momma ain't no ho (no ho)
My momma ain't raise no ho (no ho)
Drop a pin and in ten we at your door, nigga
Ho bitches gettin' fucked on the floor
They cold-hearted so you gotta do 'em cold
These hoes and my momma can't get along (why?)
'Cause my momma ain't no ho
I was runnin' up a check with the homies on the disk
I was fuckin' up the pork, I ain't ever do the feds
Got some YGs from the gang, they'll do you for a check
And you know I'm gang gang 'cause that's the only thing I rep
Ayy, momma
When I leave the house it's for them dollars
You are the reason I bought that choppa
'Cause I know you wanna see me come home proper
Soon as I get right I said I gotcha then I gotcha
4Hunnid!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud (make my momma proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud, yeah (proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, momma ain't raise no ho, one more time
Yeah, my momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho

[Verse 3: Offset]
Momma taught me how to get that bankroll (momma)
Yeah, vault up in my loft in case the bank closed (vault, yeah)
Momma ain't have it all, we wore the same clothes (have it all)
I kicked the door, I kicked the door, I risked it all for dough (kicked the door)
I found that .44, it turned me to an animal (4, 4)
Got that wide load, niggas wasn't even compatible (wide load)
Choppa firin', it soundin' just like a rattler
.223 caliber, you ain't in my caliber (oh, oh)
Momma told me pray 'cause they'll keep givin' me these bucks (bucks)
Sit on that G6, I'm flyin' high, Aladdin on the rug (momma)
I put Goyard on my momma (Goyard)
Every nigga, not cha partner, son, when you come up (come up)
All them bitches in your face, son, they are piranhas
Stay up out the way, but beat him if he run up (run up)
Mike Jack in his prime with Madonna
I'm just tryna bring her to my momma (momma)

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud (make my momma proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, I'm just tryna make my momma proud, yeah (proud, yeah)
I ain't tryna let my momma down (down, down, down)
Yeah, momma ain't raise no ho, one more time
Yeah, my momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho
Yeah, yeah, momma ain't raise no ho

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
Do it for the hood, nigga, rep
Southside with an F 'cause I'm fresh

Southside with an F 'cause I'm fresh
