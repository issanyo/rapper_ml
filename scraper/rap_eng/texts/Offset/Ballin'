[Hook: Offset]
Ballin' like I'm Stockton
Fucking on a thot, my pockets stuffed up just like stockings
Smoking on the cookie, I got diamonds water moccassin
Niggas get to talkin', yeah that Uzi get poppin' 'em
All about that broccoli
Walk up in the club with them VVS twinkling
Hit ‘em with the doo’s doo's, make them bodies start to weakenin'
Work her in the kitchen whip it, skrt skrt whippin' it
Ain't talkin' 'bout money, close the curtains on the Bentley

[Verse 1: Big Bank Black]
King shit, numero uno
All I ever wanted was a bankroll
Tryna to run it up, run it up
That's all I keep on tellin' myself
Big boy diamonds, big boy spots
Big boy ballin', got these hoes stalkin' us
Anytime she see me when I pull up on the bitch, I be dead fresh
That nigga fresh as hell, bruh
Anytime they see me when I pull up on them niggas, I be iced out
That nigga blingin' like fuck
Ain't no ordinary nigga, I'm a living legend
I'm 'bout to text my ex bitch tell she missed a blessing
You missed it

[Hook: Offset]
Ballin' like I'm Stockton
Fucking on the thot, my pockets stuffed up just like stockings
Smoking on the cookie, I got diamonds water moccassin
Niggas get to talkin', yeah that Uzi get poppin' 'em
All about that broccoli
Walk up in the club with them VVS twinkling
Hit ‘em with the doo’s doo's, make them bodies start to weakenin'
Work her in the kitchen whip it, skrt skrt whippin' it
Ain't talkin' 'bout money, close the curtains on the Bentley

[Verse 2: Offset]
Yeah, we came from the Nawf and we had no respect
I told you that young Offset not gon' go for that
I jumped up in the crowd, punched him like Ron Artest
I'm pushin' the dash, I'm going 110 this is a 600S
These bitches be cappin', they talkin' about this
But all they want is sex
I deserve to ball, I wanted to scoop me a 100 on new Patek's
Bitch you know I'm a dog
Finesse for the check, now her nigga keep callin' with threats
And I sold it all that shit is outgoing, I'm bout to go board on a jet
I'm doing a show in Amsterdam and they can't match the murder with that
Hot in the kitchen a 100 degrees these niggas can't handle the pan
These niggas will knock you off for a lil fee they taking a couple of racks
In the Lambo, sometimes it be hard to breath because the engine in the back

[Hook: Offset]
Ballin' like I'm Stockton
