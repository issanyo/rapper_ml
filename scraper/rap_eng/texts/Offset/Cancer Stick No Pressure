Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Offset]
Do like I do, nigga flip you some money
Okay, we really came up from nothing
Two hundred that shit, the clutch in the foreign
Two hundred racks in the trap when I'm touring
Thanking the lord when I wake up this morning
Christian Dior when I'm dressing in garments
Yeah, shoot at my targets
Yeah, aiming at artists
Yeah, trap out the Hellcat Charger
You niggas character, Marvel
Take your shoes off on my marble
Your bitches got lost in the sauce, off the startle
