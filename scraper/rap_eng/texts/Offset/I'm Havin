Take you back when I was 17, had the Buick Century
More money more problems, I’m just tryna make history
Back then I ain’t have it, stacked all my cabbage, now Flippa havin
And I still make the best plays
Call me John Madden, Flippa McFadden
Ooh, I’m having, ooh, I’m having
Came from bricks to the mansions
I know that I'm dabbing, I know that I'm havin

[Verse 1: Skippa Da Flippa]
When I was 17, I used to juug out the Buick Century
Then I copped a Grand Marquis, blacked out with a trunk of 15's
Came from whipping the stove to kicking in doors
My fam ain’t like it, stay back where you can’t see it, I’m just tryna get more
I got kicked out of school, I followed no rules
Got caught on the news, young nigga but I watch how I move
I broke in some cars, I stuck up some bars
Niggas say I wouldn't be shit, I stayed dedicated, I got on my bars
And free those behind bars, they stayed down in the yard
I don’t matter the case, keep it 100, get back, take a charge

[Verse 2: Offset]
I’m having, even when I was living in the Madisons
Blew my money on fashion, I had it
Even if I had to go and kick a door and grab it
Niggas was flexing talking bout his money
I had to beat em, had to take that seven hundreds
I was a robber, I never been fronted
Remember them nights with no food in my stomach
The streets they made me, and guess what they summoned
Told my mama Imma go get the commas
I took off on niggas, I flew to a comet
Thanking the lord because these blessings is abundant
When we shoot in the club that pussy nigga got to running
When I move it to the North, nigga start getting to the money
I find it kinda funny, you the same bitch said I wouldn’t be nothing
I travel around the country and you staying with your mommy
I was acting like a dummy when I had the fucking gumby
We was at the park, niggas giving out the free rock
I hit a lick the first day, six months out in county
