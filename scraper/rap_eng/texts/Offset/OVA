[Intro]
Young Chop on the beat

[Pre-Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
When the dope hit the water, boy, it's over
He get his hands on some clean, then it's over
When them Cali pounds land, boy, it's over
When that new Phantom ride hit the dealership, boy, it's over

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Just bought a Rollie, boy, it's over
And if your Rollie tick-tick, the jeweler conned you
Got a brand new Cuban link, boy, it's over
You talkin' slick, when I catch you, boy, it's over
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I got shooters from the Mid to Magnolia
When they catch you down bad, boy, it's over (O-V-A)
Two hits of that Cali, boy, it's over (O-V-A)
One time for them niggas on that corner (Riverdale)
I'm a Clayton County nigga, born soldier (Squad)
Every time a nigga under pressure, I won't fold, bruh
Yacht-Master II on my wrist cost a Rover
If that boy a lil' bigger, grab the thirty, hit him with the cobra
I pay you 70K a year just to roll up (Flocka)
Half a brick of that yayo make her nose bust (Bah)
Have them young niggas rush your traphouse like a drug bust
Who them niggas throwin' money? Bitch, you know it's us

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Just bought a Rollie, boy, it's over
And if your Rollie tick-tick, the jeweler conned you
Got a brand new Cuban link, boy, it's over
You talkin' slick, when I catch you, boy, it's over
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over

[Verse 2: Offset]
It's over, it's over, my niggas move coca (It's over)
You niggas is bogus, we travel the world, yeah, we global (Woo)
Everything we do explicit, everything I buy expensive (Expensive)
When you hear bosses, they talkin', you better just listen (Boss)
Money be taller than midgets (Money)
The J's, they knocking like Jehovah's Witness (J's)
I'm dropping the top on the Audi, no ceiling
You know that it's over (It's over)
Killin' these niggas, my Louis V loafers (Louis V)
Sippin' on Actavis, that purple potion (Actavis)
Beating the pot call me Offset Zaytoven (Beat it, beat it)
Eighty-five birds in the trunk, call that Ochocinco (Brr)
They gave the wrong nigga money like Johnny Cinco
Finessin' the plug, hit him with the lingo (Finesse)
I'm taking your sack, that's a repo (Give it up)
Offset the don, I carry them hundreds (Offset), I don't carry ones (Hundreds)
Smokin' on gas, atomic bomb (Gas)
This for my niggas that's raised in the slums that didn't have a crumb (My niggas)
Poppin the molly my mouth got numb
Mafia life, I'm Al Capone (Mafia)
Doing more numbers than Dow Jones (Huh)
Sipping the drank out a styrofoam (Go)

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Just bought a Rollie, boy, it's over
And if your Rollie tick-tick, the jeweler conned you
Got a brand new Cuban link, boy, it's over
You talkin' slick, when I catch you, boy, it's over
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over

[Verse 3: Ca$h Out]
Over (Over), roger that (Roger that)
My bitches never came short, so don't come short on my pack
Money tree just for the shade, baby, fuck around, reach for a stack
And it's wintertime and I'm feelin' good, might as well let my top back
Put, I put ostrich all on my sleeve, I put ostrich all on your bitch
And you know it's Gambino when you see them crystals all in that brick
Tell my shooters stand far from me, want them niggas to think it's a lick
In the club with the snubnose, no helmet, and he got a light kick, ooh
Plug sendin' bricks over (Extras)
Plug sendin' weed over (He sendin' extras)
Plug sendin' boy over (He sendin' extras)
Cookin' up the rap, Hova (Cookin' up the)
Next stop NYC, Raffaello (Raffaello)
My trap boomin' so hard
He say I come through more than Melo

[Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame]
Just bought a Rollie, boy, it's over
And if your Rollie tick-tick, the jeweler conned you
Got a brand new Cuban link, boy, it's over
You talkin' slick, when I catch you, boy, it's over
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A) it's over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over (O-V-A)
Over (O-V-A), over
