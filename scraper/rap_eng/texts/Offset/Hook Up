[Intro: Lil Baby & Offset]
Cook that shit up Quay
Cook it up (hey)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Offset]
VVS's in my tennis bracelets
Could've bought my mama a Mercedes (mama)
Still bought my mama a Merecedes (mama)
Put a hundred racks in my mama's savings (racks)
Fuck all that bullshit, keep me a full clip (fuck it)
Dressed in all white like some cool whip (woo)
That money turned me to a slave (slave)
I bought some chains and a brand new whip (uh)
Everybody on my drip now (drip)
This a stick up, get down (stick)
They mad 'cause I'm running my town (who?)
King me, where's my crown? (woo)
Still selling bags of the loud (bag)
Make a pussy nigga pipe down (ah)
Dashboard say a two and a quarter, I do it
Got your bitch jamming my new shit

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Offset]
Two door, today I feel coupe-ish (two door)
You had a chance but you blew it (blew it)
Bankrolls on me, they all blue-in', yeah (racks)
Who ever thought I would do this? (who?)
Told them I already knew this (I knew it)
Extendo Glock, I don't tote Rugers
Money too long for a ruler (long)
Money same size as a school bus (uh)
I used to trap on a school bus, yeah
I used to serve on a scooter (serve)
Now I spend racks on my jeweler (racks)
Offset with me, beat this beat up (Set)
They thinkin' we got the hook up (hook up)
Net worth one mil, you can look up (look up)
Make 'em look down, got 'em shook up (ahh)
Five hundred racks when I re-up (woo)
They talkin' down but hate we up (who?)
Bad bitches all in my DM (bad)
I hope my ho never see them (no)
I know she probably gon' leave me (ooh)
Fuck it, I'm still gonna be me (fuck it)
None of these niggas can't be me (nah)
Break in the house for a TV (TV)
Now they see me all on TV (hey)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Offset]
VVS's in my tennis bracelets
Could've bought my mama a Mercedes (mama)
Still bought my mama a Merecedes (mama)
Put a hundred racks in my mama's savings (racks)
Fuck all that bullshit, keep me a full clip (fuck it)
Dressed in all white like some cool whip (woo)
That money turned me to a slave (slave)
I bought some chains and a brand new whip (uh)
Everybody on my drip now (drip)
This a stick up, get down (stick)
They mad 'cause I'm running my town (who?)
King me, where's my crown? (woo)
Still selling bags of the loud (bag)
Make a pussy nigga pipe down  (Offset)
Dashboard say a two and a quarter, I do it
Got your bitch jamming my new shit

[Verse 2: Offset]
Hundred racks, no counterfeit (racks)
I bought a mansion secluded (hey)
Aimin' the stick at medulas (baow)
12 behind me in the Hellcat, I lose 'em (12)
Bentley coupe come out at night Freddie Kreuger
Detach my top, bitch I'm switching my mood in (woo)
Boogers on me, bitch it's nasty, a loogy
Lil Baby dunk it, I oop it (huh)
Wait, pull up with the K (wait)
Nigga poppin' so I put the ten on his face (brrt)
She never seen the stars in the skin of the Wraith (stars)
Fuck her in the jaw, send a pen to your place (ahh)
Skeleton AP, it got a diamond in the face (woo)
Wrapped around the bezel, having water like a lake (water, splash)
Pateks on fleek, got baguettes in my neck (hey)
Bitch want some molly, some perky, some X (X)
Hit her one time, do not text, get the exit (uh)
Watch on my 'Gram, see me boardin' the jet (woo)
Count all these racks and I flex and I flex it (racks)
I pray to the lord at night 'fore I forget it (God)
Pray on my downfall, he mad 'bout a bitch (huh)
I let the F&N eat out your ribs (bah)
Water my wrist and my orchards for real (splash)
Three hundred K on my whip (skrt)

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Offset]
VVS's in my tennis bracelets
Could've bought my mama a Mercedes (mama)
Still bought my mama a Merecedes (mama)
Put a hundred racks in my mama's savings (racks)
Fuck all that bullshit, keep me a full clip (fuck it)
Dressed in all white like some cool whip (woo)
That money turned me to a slave (slave)
