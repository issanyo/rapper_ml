[Refrain: Tinashe & (Offset)]
I can't cop the coupe, don't do shit for two (skrr, skrr)
All black truck, hangin' out the roof (brr, brr)
Mobbin' through the hills, pulled up with my crew (who)
I can't cop the coupe, don't do shit for two (nah)

[Verse 1: Tinashe & (Offset)]
Said I'm fallin' off, but they won't JFK me
Tried to be myself, but they won't AKA me (me)
AKA a popstar AKA a problem (bow, bow)
AKA don't hold me back, I swear I got 'em (hey)
We pulled up in Gucci, dripped down in Gabbana (drip, drip)
Bad as I wanna, only chasin' commas (woo, woo)
I need me a side thing, hold the drama (side)
I need me a soldier, he gon' hold the line up (bow, bow)

[Chorus: Tinashe & (Offset)]
Don't want no drama-ma-a
We pulled up in that ooh la la (sk-skrr)
And backed out in that oh my god (woo, woo, woo)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (no, hey)
Don't want no drama-ma-a
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god (hey)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (don't want no drama-ma)

[Refrain: Tinashe & (Offset)]
I can't cop the coupe, don't do shit for two (skrr, skrr)
All black truck, hangin' out the roof (yeah, yeah)
Mobbin' through the hills, pulled up with my crew (crew)
I can't cop the coupe, don't do shit for two (nah)

[Verse 2: Tinashe & (Offset)]
I got way too many people, all my niggas equal (hey)
If my life was like a movie I'd need 50 sequels (movie)
I need 60 bad bitches actin' like they single (smash)
Yellin' you can't sit with us, throwin' up middle fingers

[Chorus: Tinashe & (Offset)]
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama)
We pulled up in that ooh la la (ooh la la)
And backed out in that oh my god (oh my God)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama, no)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama, no)
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my God
Don't want no drama-ma-a

[Verse 3: Offset]

She like the way I'm drippin' organic (true, true)
Yacht on my wrist, the Titanic (yeah, raahh)
Come ride on this shit like a banshee (raahh)
Get high on the perky and xanny (high)
From Dubai on a jet to Miami (Dubai)
When the chopper start kickin' it's damage (brr, brr)

Invite your main bitch to a slumber (smash)
My money long, out there yonder (long)
Fat ass with a flat stomach (flat)
Piguet black, cost the whole hundred
The coupe fast, goin' two hundred (skrr)

[Chorus: Tinashe & (Offset)]
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama)
We pulled up in that ooh la la (ooh la la)
And backed out in that oh my god (oh my God)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama, no)
Don't want no drama-ma-a (I don't want no drama, no)
We pulled up in that ooh la la

Don't want no drama-ma-a
