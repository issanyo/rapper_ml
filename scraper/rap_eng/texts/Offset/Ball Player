[Intro]
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player

[Hook]
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player
He was poor, he didn’t have no clothes, hung out with the hard heads
Selling dope, his momma ain’t know, his trap going retarded
Young nigga started with a dream and now he is the cartel

[Verse 1]
Young nigga gotta keep your face good
If you run off you will never get a major plug
I can’t wait till Takeoff Jackson give me them Harriet Tubs
I had a dream that I was a baller but I couldn’t make the buzzer
Then it got ugly, I was broke, so I trapped with my cousin
Then I start rapping, niggas laughed at me, we started juugin’ then we starting’ buzzin’
We came from nothing, so I bought me a Lamb and I punch it
My engine sound like Jumanji, extended clip like a bungee
My momma didn’t know nothing
Young nigga tryna make it
Smokin’ on cookie Jamaican
I’m Trapping out the bando vacant
Now I got a bad bitch from Malaysia

[Hook]
Young nigga had a dream to be a ball player
He was poor, he didn’t have no clothes, hung out with the hard heads
Selling dope, his momma ain’t know, his trap going retarded
Young nigga started with a dream and now he is the cartel
