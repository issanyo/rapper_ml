[Chorus: JBan$]
Boost Mobile trapping, serving all the fiends
Hey I got three phones, and all of 'em ringing
Hey I got three phones, I'm serving lean
Hey I got three phones, for all my fiends
Boost Mobile trapping, serving all the fiends
Hey I got three phones, and all of 'em ringing
Hey I got three phones, I'm serving lean
Hey I got three phones, for all my fiends, yeah

[Verse 1: JBan$]
Phone chirping, I'm really having, hey
Call me if you need it, I just got that pack in, hey
Baby hit my phone, I can't miss no action
Hey I'm never lackin', gotta keep a rachet
Hey I got white like a peppermint, just call Trident
Hey I got M's like a Buck, runnin', keep on pilin'
Hey, bitches from Hawaii, fuck her on my island
I said whip my salad, I don't do thousand island
I could walk on water, then walk on land
Pockets stuffed like bibles, bitch I'm the man
Take her on vacation, feet all in the sand
We do it again, then do it again
I'm the band man, saran-ran, get 'em in
I like my molly white, cocaine white, and lean red
Take work on the flight, baby this a G-5 jet, ayy
Don't even sweat, it's still RIP to Fred

[Chorus: JBan$]

[Verse 2: Offset]
Bitch I am serving, the molly landed here from Persia
Better put some respect on the birdies
I'm selling cocaine, it's clean, detergent
Damn my phone keep ringing
It must be urgent
I been grinding so hard, bitch I'm working
Six bricks, Julius Irving
Flood up the trap like concession stand
I do not go through the middle man
I need a bigger scale, bigger grams
Cookin' up dope like it's honey ham
Maison Margiela, they scrape the ground
I'm on a four of the Act now
My money bigger than Shaq now
Take over the block, this my town, hey
