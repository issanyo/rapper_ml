All of my money neat
All of my bitches freaky
Everybody know it
It ain't a secret, (x2)
That boy right there got dough
That boy right there got money
That boy right there got hoes
That boy right there on go
That boy ain't gon fold
(That boy right there) x4

[Longway]
Run up on yo ass wit the dirty stick
Margiela steppin on the bricks
Cavahli my body, i come from narcotics
I been kidnapped yo bitch
Swagger too dope a whole bag on my outfit
Auti Quattro forgie mounted wit lipstick
Jeremy Scott Adida wings
I believe that I can fly
Molly hit me bitches know that im booted
This ain't a video, can be a movie
Double down Dirty Harry don dealer
Choppa spin like I'm Lugi
On my command niggas tie up they boots
Salute, My niggas come shoot
Bought that president rollie five bricks on my wrist
African diamonds that come out the mine
007 Coupe James Bond, Got a grand hustle like TIP
I bought the same guns, look at this bitch on the dapper don
That boy right there, Trappin & rappin and put it in the air
Catch it and serve it to that boy right there
Hannah Montana OG Gas no air
That boy right there give a fuck !... (Longway Bitch!)

[Offset]
Runnin round the lobby
Chickens in the Mazi
Whippin up a brick like its Habachi
Givenchy stepping flyer than a pilot
My nigga walkin rounf wit the rocket
They itchin scratchin for a body, Move in silence
L-L-Longway its been a long day, Sippin Activus like its a Bombay
Giuseppe when im steppin thats my Feng Shui
Catch a nigga slippin in the alley way
Ya bitch walkin round wit the club face
Christian my Louboutin's with no lace
Graa Graa leavin no trace
Get on yo knees nigga say ya grace
FREEZE, like you seen the cops, bullets have you shakin dread locks
Flintstones make her bed rock, McFlair yo bitch she ina leg lock
Desert Eagle like the Terminator, Giuseppe stepping flavored alligators
Ballin on you niggas wit no major
Mansion 20 floors, 20 acres...
