[Hook: Offset]
It's a Panarama in the driveway
Feds watching, we in the projects
They know we ain't posed to be driving that
Fucking the natnats and alley cats
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
The police ain't liking that, we still handle business
We trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
The police ain't liking it, we still handle business

[Verse 1: Offset]
The trap got niggas on top of the roof they assassins
My plug from Saudi Arabia, call him Aladdin
We pulling 'em triggers and 'Rarris and pull up in Aston
(skr, skr, Aston Martin)
The feds they mad, they know what we doin', can't catch us
I stand on the stove, I beat the pot up like I'm Cassius
They call me Chris Angel, work disappear like it is magic
Look at the scale make sure the grams is accurate
Wrap it in plastic, then I package it
Mohammed need bricks up in Africa
Go to California, we smoking medicals
Trap professional, money all over my schedule
I made a million, that's historical
I Pray to God because I am biblical
Work take her clothes off like a physical
When I cook up a baby, they come out identical
Bill Nye cause I'm whippin up chemicals
Workin' been trapping ten years, boy you pitiful

[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
We still handle business, sins I committed
I'm countin' up tickets
I'm thumbing through Benjis
Young nigga, I did it
(I Did it, we did it)
What's that in yo drive-way?
Maybe Karma Fisker (skirr, Fisker?)
Young nigga get witcha, yes, I'm tha Flippa
Yes I will flip ya
Shout out my big bruh Dwayne Bowe
Who stay ten toes
Might pull up in a Rover, hit me some hoes
Then touchdown on the Migos
We flexin' in minchi
You wanna keep seat, nigga get yo own section
So much gold on me, ice on me, money on me
That you thought I was Freemason (Freemason)
Neva, you after dem hoes
Blue faces I'm chasin'
She got a back in four thirty five
Countin' up green,you think that I'm plankton
So what is you driving?
It's nothing u riding
I pull up in something you cannot pronounce
And I smoke by the ounce

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
(nah nah dont pick up, dont pick up, put your money back down, nah nah nah nah put your money back down)
The hell is you doin'?
Fuck is you doin'? Where the hell is you goin'?
Nigga trynna' steal my flow hit em 44
Make ya brain blow
Murder she wrote
F&N extendo' Subway Footlongs All I tote!
In your neighborhood broad daylight searchin' for another kick door
Slow it down, slow it down
Speed it up breakin' that spatula whippin' that dope
(Turn around, turn around)
Baby I don't wanna fuck you I just want that throat!
I had a plan to work with that man I, I caught that man
Now I'm the man
Move to Afghanistan, now I got bands
I'm speakin' the lingo you can't comprehend
