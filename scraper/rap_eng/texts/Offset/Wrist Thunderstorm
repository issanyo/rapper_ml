[Intro: Offset]
Okay, hey

[Chorus: Offset]
Wrist thunderstorm, yeah
Javi, don't wanna see prone
I kick your bitch out the gang, she get hung (gang)
Hold that shit down, she got dope in her thong (dope)
Yeah, yeah, pull up too quick (yeah)
Suicide door like I'm slitting my wrist (slit, wrist)
Fuck off my name lil' bitch (smash)
Kill the pussy then bury the bitch (hey, hey)
We fiend for the cash we get (cash)
Kel-Tec, beam with a plastic clip (brrt)
Double my millions and flip
Double my cup when I'm pourin' a fifth (mud)
Dreams of counting a mil (dreams)
When I had woke up I had 'em for real (for real)
Fiends all up in my ear (fiends)
Ask for the dope I ain't served in years (Offset)

[Verse 1: Offset]
Fashion, bitch I'm Mike Jackson (Mike)
Patek, the diamonds do backflips (woo)
Spike, the Louboutins cactus (spike)
Fishtail the coupe with no traction (skrt)
Takin' your bitch, I kidnap shit (c'mon)
Whack shit, clap shit, tactics (whack)
Private the plane, up my status (private)
It's only a quarter in the mattress (quarter)
Speed racing (speed)
Bentley big B from the basement (Big B)
Hide and go seek with the K (hide and seek)
Put the fire in your mouth, you can face it (fire)
Nigga quit leasing the Wraith (lease)
Filling in my teeth with the glacier (hah)
Whole forty-three on a bracelet (bracelet)
Know I'm in the streets drip naked (hah)
Survived, just look in my eyes (eyes)
V12, back seat the massage (12)
We deep the game like a try
Fuckin' your bitch in my eye (smash)
Squeeze the lemon, it's out (squeeze)
Smellin' like pile of flowers (oh)
Taste it, now it's devoured (ah)
Leave your ass stank like a coward (stank)

[Chorus: Offset]
Wrist thunderstorm, yeah
Javi, don't wanna see prone
I kick your bitch out the gang, she get hung (gang)
Hold that shit down, she got dope in her thong (dope)
Yeah, yeah, pull up too quick (yeah)
Suicide door like I'm slitting my wrist (slit, wrist)
Fuck off my name lil' bitch (smash)
Kill the pussy then bury the bitch (hey, hey)
We fiend for the cash we get (cash)
Kel-Tec, beam with a plastic clip (brrt)
Double my millions and flip
Double my cup when I'm pourin' a fifth (mud)

When I had woke up I had 'em for real (for real)
Fiends all up in my ear (fiends)
Ask for the dope I ain't served in years (Offset)

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
I know some niggas that's servin' some years
Got so much ice on my neck give me chills
My bitch is so bad she don't look like she real
You sip out the bottle, I'm poppin' the seal
We pull out in foreigns, the engine the rear
I put a whole brick of ice in my ear
Smokin' on loud, I can't even hear
We shoot up the crowd, this shit can get serious
I work a move, I put it in plastic
I work the Uzi movin' through traffic
I got a bank account inside the mattress
We do not think it out, we gon' and smash it
Young nigga still sellin' work, trap out the church
When we hit the trap it's bag alert
I can't even get in the door first
Pick up the bitch with a chauffeur
Light up my wrist like the first
Diamonds water, you could surf
Groupie bitches get the curve
Killing shit, I'm on a purge
Pockets filled up like it's Sherman
Spending more than what you earning
Wrist on Hurricane Irma

[Chorus: Offset]
Wrist thunderstorm, yeah
Javi, don't wanna see prone
I kick your bitch out the gang, she get hung (gang)
Hold that shit down, she got dope in her thong (dope)
Yeah, yeah, pull up too quick (yeah)
Suicide door like I'm slitting my wrist (slit, wrist)
Fuck off my name lil' bitch (smash)
Kill the pussy then bury the bitch (hey, hey)
We fiend for the cash we get (cash)
Kel-Tec, beam with a plastic clip (brrt)
Double my millions and flip
Double my cup when I'm pourin' a fifth (mud)
Dreams of counting a mil (dreams)
When I had woke up I had 'em for real (for real)
Fiends all up in my ear (fiends)
Ask for the dope I ain't served in years (Offset)
