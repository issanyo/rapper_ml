[Intro: ILoveMakonnen]
I'ma teach you how to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it
How to whip, whip, teach you how to whip it

[Verse 1: ILoveMakonnen]
I do a cooking class on every Thursday
Parking lot at 6' o'clock jumpin' like a church place
I do a driving class on every Sunday
Turn a little Ferrari into a pretty Hyundai
They don’t know this new shit we on
We don’t really give a fuck when we in that zone
We blowing strong and gas at least, by the zone
I got bitches all night calling on my phone
Drinking lean all the day and plus I smoke with the wax
A little young nigga like me speak nothing but facts
I got them bitches out of town pulling up in a Cadillac
Smoking so much weed cause my grandma got them cataracts

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Migos and Makonnen keep the blue Benjamins only
Trapping OG gas out the hotbox, and it’s stolen
I can teach you how to whip a whole thing
Hundred percent, that is cocaine
Young nigga kicking it like Liu Kang
Money coming back to me like boomerang
Teach me how to whip it, I got birds singing like Whitney
I can show a nigga how to make a million
I can show a nigga how to stash in the ceiling
I got the club going up, that was on a Tuesday
One phone call to the plug, he on the freeway
I can teach a nigga how to touch down on a plug just for a half a milli
I can teach a nigga how to pour a four of the muddy trouble cause I’m purple sipping
I can teach a nigga how to grab a chopper with extensions, spray the block with no intentions
I can show you just how to be real with you
If you’re pussy then nigga can’t deal with you

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it

[Verse 3: Rich The Kid]
Teaching your bitch how to whip it
Kitchen, I cook up the Bentley
Bando, I made me a milli
Bitch, I had birds in the ceiling
These niggas snakes, that’s what Quavo told me
Got blue Benjamins, went and bought a Rolex
Whip a brick with the baking soda
Rich nigga trap off a Motorola
Come to the block, we got quality
Breaking my wrist, tryna whip a key
I was 12 with a felony
Sipping lean, that promethazine
I fell in love with the codeine
Young rich nigga, plenty chains on me
This how you whip up the coca
Remix the brick, then you flip it over

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it

Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

[Verse 4: Offset]
Teach me how to whip
In the kitchen cooking, no Jiffy
Made a quarter milli off of selling biscuits
Fucking with the brick, you need a tissue
Sold ten birds on Tuesday
Louboutin kicking, your bitch brought me kisses
I get more head than a toupee
I can be your tutor, baking soda, watch how I do it
In the lab, cooking the slab, stretch it ho, make it long as a ruler
I got niggas and they got on your medulla
Bottle like a cobra, hit em with the cooler
Rapped for three years and we made a lot of improvement
Don’t be a hater, nigga get with the movement
Used to be a nuisance riding with the ruler
On the Molly, booted, and I ran in to go use it
Nigga got a juug then I’m not gonna refuse it
Tryna rob a nigga without a strap, nigga you are foolish
Looking at my diamond confused, is it fluid?
Out of town bags, but you know a nigga flew em
Skippa da Flippa, he trappin' bricks down in Newmans
Plug is an alien, my plug not a human

[Hook: ILoveMakonnen]
But my friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it

Teach me how to whip whip, teach me how to whip it
My friend Makonnen, is teaching me how to whip it
