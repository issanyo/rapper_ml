Nigga wuz born and brought up in Cleveland
Cool quiet just like my daddy
When I wuz thuggin out in the alley
With my boys in a stolen Caddie

And every now and then I sip some Hennesey
And after my niggas wuz bustin we probably wuz lookin for trouble
Uh Oh here come the po po

And niggas'll leave ya bleedin
Fuck what they said about Bone catch us anywhere
Grab a couple of my St. Claire niggas take us anywhere

[Verse 3: Layzie]
We get em, split em, we hit em
And Bone been the shit since I could remember
Befo most of these niggas even thought about rap
We wuz screamin out no surrender
With a gat in the hand runnin wild in the land
With a pocket full of boulders
Po po know they can't hold us
When they east dog comin from the shoulders
And the older niggas they told us
U gotta get down fo yo hustle
Got Glocks to show you this muscle
Get the money little nigga don't struggle
That's no bitch nigga that's the rules
All my Cleveland niggas said to me
They're the ones that gave this game to me
Ima push this shed to the head ya see
