[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Tonight, I feel like syn I'm finna get into
But see that's what the Hennessey & gin will do
And I've been scoping
You already know I'm feeling you
Visualizing, fantasizing
Different ways to get into you
And I don't mean to come off cynical
I'm just being original
Let's skip all the subliminals
I'm the nigga you awe
And you just what I need right now
As I breeze through the clouds
Ain't no need to fly down, c'mon
We should flee to my house
Lovely, love me long time
Come hop in my fly Mercedes, baby
Just for tonight I be your man, you my lady
I know she sneaky with it
But she freaky with it
So let's cut off the lights
And me and you can get it
See I got my own lil nasty girl
To come in play in Bone Bone's nasty world

[Chorus: Jesse Rankins]
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Ooh like a carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
They gotta love when baby can do Bone
Cause I'm always on the move, in a meeting or a show
When the board boom seven hundred and fifty million
She's so dope only gold diggers know
Bitches only looking for a nigga with some dough
That's why I always keep a freak on the low
I'm having fun but the shit was gettin' old
That's the one and she told me that she'll never let me go
Walking blindly, time he crossed sixty ninety
Put ya in a place where no one can find
Black widow mama wanna hustle climbing out my window
No, you really want my money but I play em' like Nintendo
Would you cash that cash that? Oh, you can have that
Never seen a brother get his cash back, who you laughed
And we still smokin' we chokin' blunts all wide open let's go

[Bridge: Jesse Rankins]
Puff, puff, then pass it babe
Tonight you'll be my nasty baby
We gon' be lit on some other shit
We gon' be lit on some other shit
Puff, puff, then pass it babe
Tonight you'll be my nasty baby
We gon' be lit, yeah
We gon' be lit on some other shit

[Chorus: Jesse Rankins]
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Ooh like a carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby
Hands up high, let em' stay there
Ooh like a carnival state fair
Go fast, with no safety belt
Go fast, with no safety baby
