[Intro]
C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2,  C2
C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2
C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2, C2
I think I might be happy
Nigga, it's C2
SSET, SSET, SSET

[Hook]
Nigga, know I'm too savage
I got two ratchets
Get your crew blasted
Roof, trashed it
Mazi flew past 'em
Foreign coupe, smash 'em
New classic
Black and blue graphic
I got two Ashleys
Blew at it
Pour a deuce after
I got two Fantas (sure)

[Post-Hook]
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch

[Bridge]
Whoo-o!
She sucking that dick, she fucking the SSET, she know what to do
Yeah, I do
Get these niggas phone stop fucking with me nigga lets go

[Verse]
Nigga, I pop three percs and go insane
I can't feel a thing
Been fucking her soft for days
I piss in your face and say rain
I ashed in her drink, then I put that dick in her face
I hop in that pussy go ape
My boxers is Bape
My dick is out for Harambe
If you a gorilla get sprayed
You niggas is lame
You popping your shit on the sink
I walk in that bitch like Aaron Carter
I got candy, ask them boys if they want it
I got 400 selling Magikarp
Got a Gyarados, drove it, then evolved it
I went in the sauna with my bracelets on me
Made water water, Tobirama tsunami
Totally drama, I pull up and pop at your momma
I got a new groove boy, I move with the llama
Nigga hop out the Fisker, Byrd gang militia
Scooped by Melissa
I'm in the kitchen, remix with Smitty
Fucked up the scale, right at the anchor
Rollie don't tick by my time is expensive
Keep my name out of your motherfucking mentions
Ain't on your friends list
Block up, defensive
This ain't a scrimmage, champion

[Hook]
Nigga, know I'm too savage
I got two ratchets
Get your crew blasted
Roof, trashed it
Mazi flew past 'em
Foreign coupe smash 'em
New classic
Black and blue graphic
I got two Ashleys
Blew at it
Pour a deuce after
I got two Fantas

[Post-Hook]
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
Know I'm finer than your bitch
