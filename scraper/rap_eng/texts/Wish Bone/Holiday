[Intro: Robb Banks + Sample]
I think I might be happy
I like that sound
That mean shit is finna start
I don't want to give you up
I don't want to give you up
I don't want to give you up
I don't want to hod you up
Happy
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Sure, sure, sure, sure
Aye, sure

[Verse]
My sex game better than my text game
Shoot the same way, got the same plays
I seen a new jersey like the Nets playing
And I nut in her don't say a thang
I'ma slide off, board the next plane
Her man probably gonna raise her
He be tryna look like me anyway
I done took some time off, why?
Niggas got they lies off
Them interviews, they was so cute
See you say my name, your views get a boost
Nigga, bird's eye, get a better view
Count every bullet that we send at you
Even Adam was looking upset with you
You gonna get him shot, nigga, tell the truth
I'm high as Nasir off the foil , cup full of soil
Suck my dick, get a reward
I went Hashirama with your daughter
Grow into a problem, sue, I'll put the wood in your lawyer
Nigga, I sleep all summer
Know I'm gonna, stunt all month
Know I'll, appear just once
Just to remind you who's number one
I, don't give a fuck
Really don't give a fuck
Seen too much
Drink lean too much
I wish Hope could forgive me
Gain her trust
Cause she, had a bad friend that I really wanted to fuck
Goddamn
