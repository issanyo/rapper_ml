Something that could make you do wrong, make it do you right (x4)

(Layzie:)
Look nigga from the cradle to the grave
You gotta hustle to get paid
I'm so thuggish in my ways
I usually go hard for days
I ain't gon' slow down I speed up
And mash on your section
Ain't no time to kick your feet up
I'm past the arrestin
They taught me word is like a pussy
Nigga play and get fucked
I'm out here mindin my own buisness
Niggas pressin their luck
And I'm like stuck in the middle of a rock and a hard place
Makin my money rappin and I won't stop til it's all laced
Movin by the lords grace
Tryin to win the long race
End up in the wrong place
Any given day nigga...

(Hook:)
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder...
Something that could make you do wrong, make it do you right

(Krayzie:)
My rent ain't paid, my shit ain't straight
I'm ready to flip, I'm goin insane
Because my kids ain't ate
They lookin at daddy askin why ain't no food on their plate
Tryin to have faith but I don't know how much more I can take
Before I risk it all, forget the law
Get in my car, head to the local liquor store
Now stick em up
Fuck all, ya'll
Somebody gotta explain to me
How I'm workin a 9 to 5 and still can't get the things we need
My anger leads to me pullin a double barrel barrel shotgun biscuit for everything but me

(Hook x4)
(Wish:)
Hit em hard and bleed
Momma who you can see
Fuck the law, niggas draw
Yea but who gon' bleed
In the middle of this funk beat shit in the trunk
I provide it but if you really want it let's get jump
Granny says slow it down
Cause you really got somethin
And you need to stick around
But I hustle, cause they got dough
And my minds blown
I'm a stick up kid
Better watch in you rearview
Cause they got issues
Fuck around and they will miss you
Hurtin up but fuckin up
Lucky if I miss you
