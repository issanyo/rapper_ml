[Layzie Bone]
Thangs can get rough, when you live in the ghetto
You gotta survive, no matter the pain
Nigga be hurting, life'll be hurting
But nigga for certain, this is the game
Man don't let them win, never let the system think they got you
If you relentless they can't stop you let em hang, they gone watch you
Yeah we the enemies of the world, won't let no territories homie
You got to get up, get out and get something, that's what they told me
Back in the days didn't have a pot to piss, window to throw it out of
Now I'm balling doing my damn thang, laughing at them dollas
Holla holla, if you hear me shorty, I'mma live everyday
Like it's my last, only the winner gone get the glory
What you thought I play for keeps
Put it down wicked in these streets
Heavily armored with the heat
Just in case a nigga want some beef
Being broke I know the feeling, that's why I'm paper chasing this cash
Better be smart and keep a stash, never know how long it's gone last
You do the math, hustling niggas multiply like mountains
Bone Thugs, Little Layzie 30 million and counting, come on

[Hook - 2x]
Money money, the mighty dolla dolla
Got to get my grind on, grind on, grind on
I don't wanna be broke no more

[Bizzy Bone]
You ain't worthy, none of you niggas could stop me
And none of you niggas could hurt me
If worse come to worse, I'mma get down and dirty
Though the Ouija can't curse me, NWA
Eazy E, that's the nigga that birthed me, hey
Thug style motherfucker, live forget ends
I'd never testify, Satan can't divide my piers
No weakness inside my fears
Drop tears, for niggas that died
I'm gonna safe divide, mind gone
And I think I'm running out of time
The god damn baby's daddy
And I'm gonna damned to hell, if I don't abide
And that's why I yell, B-E-N-Z we ride
Straight to the corner, down to the side
In the B-E-N-Z we
Roll around the corner with the F-O-R-T
S-C-V, and a nigga can't fuck with me
Not even the devil with B-O-N-E
T-H-U-G spell it motherfucker

[Hook - 2x]

[Wish Bone]
Scandalous, straight up out of the hood type nigga
Stick up's, robberies, do we did gives a fuck nigga
See all ways to money so we mashing, we dashing
Get paid around parting give me twist a thug and I get up, in that ass
I'm here to get that money keep it coming, show me love
We made this, gotta get mine wanna slip, it's about mine
It's harder to get, I'm serious not playing that's the pay wits
The streets have come back, real fast on that ass feel me
Cause I don't wanna be broke no more
Standing in front of the liquor store with rocks no more
Cause my man, never had nothing to done that
It's like reversing time on my mind I can't go back, fuck that

[Hook - 2x]

[Krayzie Bone]
I came up a nigga that never had nothing but hard times
I was always grinding, and talking up out of the hood
Into the bullshit, but I'm surviving
I got to get me some money man, put it down for the General
A nigga'd rob your ass, if I caught a nigga flossing cash
What it was four niggas, and we punk niggas
But you no niggas got us scared, a couple more green
To get up for everything reach the scene, clean
And we was the niggas that stood on the block
With a couple of rocks and a Glock with the cops
Can't nobody have the nuts to say our name
They call me the Dummy Man
I'm sell him a fat twenty piece and then I reach for the bomb
The things they get awfully man
Wanna see what I put them shit come
Took em for they last dollar, holla
Man I ain't giving a fuck it's do or die
So get on the ground, lay it down
Give me some money my nigga POW
I ain't waiting I need it NOW
Ain't too much changed
I'm still on the grind in deuce double O deuce
I'm just a little more serious
Bout my reefer and my dough
Show me the money

[Hook - 2x]

[Wish Bone]
Let me hear you say make money, money
Make money money, make it...
Let me hear you say take money, money
Take money money, take it... -2x
Take it

[Krayzie Bone]
Dolla bill y'all, that dolla bill y'all
I gotta gotta gotta have that dolla bill y'all -2x
