[Background]
Boom, shakalaka, boom-boom, shakalaka
Boom, shakalaka, boom-boom, shakalaka

[Chorus]
Banger! (Figg Side!)
Fool, false on your block
You get blook 'n block on your block
YAWK! (Biddy, bye-bye!)

[Verse 1]
Grab your brownie, sit the party, shake the party
Break the party, murder party, leave the body, tell nobody
Put it down, Figg Side rip ride
Grooveline wig line shots fired knock-knock, YAWK!
You ain't really 'bout that, you don't want to see a Glock out
You a pussy ass nigga, you be hoping for a cop out
Got a nine and a clip, put a nine on your hip
Keep talking that shit, knock five on your lip
G-Ride ski masks and colored rags
Contraband in bags, focused on enemigos in jags
Big sips out our flasks, we faded who next to get famous
Them bangers get banging that barrell keep changing like click-click
Shit, I wish a nigga would
Feeling fucking good, crack and scramble up your hood
Get it understood, I could have cuz leaking blood
Personal as fuck at your door drop you on your rug

[Chorus]
Banger! (Figg Side!)
Fool, false on your block
You get blook 'n block on your block
YAWK! (Biddy, bye-bye!)

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing sweet 'bout rumbling with B's
You don't need water to travel through the seas
Unravel the backwoods and crumble up the trees
Nigga, please, your skull missing now homie feel the breeze
These bullets burning gon' be hard for you to breathe
These bullets burning damn near 'possible to bleed
Off that alcohol, that nozzle flammable
Beef I prey on my preyer react like animal
Pussy, I split you like camel toe, my shoelaces matching my flannel
We be loading up ammo, y'all be making them channels
Yellow tape by them candles, gang members with killing sprees
On our agendas, real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Facial expressions say surrender
When that iron enter, lay back recline nigga
Access denied nigga, refrigerate Ziploc'n
And all genders, rather Crip or Piru, hoes get it too

[Chorus]
Banger! (Figg Side!)
Fool, false on your block
You get blook 'n block on your block
YAWK! (Biddy, bye-bye!)

[Bridge]
Y'all really into talking, we with that bullshit
Them shots is steady sparking, we on that bullshit
Your hood gon' hear them sirens, we did that bullshit
My 50 niggas wilding, we 'bout that bullshit
You know Atlanta with that bullshit
New York to Miami with that bullshit
You know Chicago with that bullshit
Kansas City down to New Orleans with that bullshit
Texas to Alabama with that bullshit
Boston and cats from Philly with that bullshit
Arizona to Seattle, they with that bullshit
Warn your momma California, we 'bout that bullshit

[Chorus]
Banger! (Figg Side!)
Fool, false on your block
You get blook 'n block on your block
YAWK! (Biddy, bye-bye!)
