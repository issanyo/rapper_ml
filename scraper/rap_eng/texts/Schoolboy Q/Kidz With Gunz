[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, pledge allegiance, my middle finger up like fuck polices
Duke back better hide your nieces, cause I’m zoned out
Tripping on purps and lean
When I was 13, I could work the nina
Just a young nigga tryna fuck Selena
I done did dirt just to bring the team up
So now I bring the team just to fuck the scene up
Niggas know what’s up, I’m in a rover truck
And with a roll of sluts, she tryna pour me up
And when she throw me up, bet I’ma hold her butt
I bet that’s why niggas wanna clone me, huh
Bet that’s why hoes be all on me, huh
Best that you walk up slowly, because I got it on me
And niggas don’t know me bruh
I’m stunting on these niggas like I’m Dana Dane
Swerving lane to lane, my niggas banging gangs
You niggas claiming gangs, you niggas claim the game
But never came to hang, so shit just ain’t the same
And now we claim you lames, huh?
See man I came up flames, and try to gain a name
And then I made the name
Bitch I ain’t even wanna change the game
These niggas telling me the rules have never played the game
Now I’m looking like what the fuck?
I told you bitch niggas not to fuck with us
Cause if you fuck with us we got to fuck you up
Pull out the bucky buck and leave you buttoned up

[Hook]
Bunch of kids, with fucking guns, big fucking guns
Bunch of kids, with fucking guns, big fucking guns
Bunch of kids, with fucking guns, big fucking guns
