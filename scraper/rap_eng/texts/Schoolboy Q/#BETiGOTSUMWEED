Verse 1:
Everytime that I wake up, I swear I'm never down
Even when I'm in my dreams, I'm high off self esteem
Blowin' on that Jamaica my nigg its not a ting, marijuana fiend
Keep your Black N Milds and cigs cuz me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Musa as we pulled up on them sixes just to go and bust some bitches
See them motherfuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with them tints, that Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel like the, orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a zanny or a klonopin
All your swishers, they be model thin
We plus size, nigga!
Like Tocarra and them, shining like a halogen
So bright, like highbeams, headlights and midnight
That one of Rhode Island's watchtower sights
Yeahh, the world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

Chorus
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
(x6)

Verse 2:
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees then let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour D
Make a order it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it till we on E
Then we fill up again with another 10
Then we just go run back to the cheese fulfill our, family needs
No worries, smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of 3's
We dyin' up in every plea
So for ya'll my niggas swear to god my heart will bleed
Kick the shit for my lifers and ones who kickin' seas
Even if it's just 5 dollars keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind cuz in due time you wine and dine
Something fine in that
Kush blunts soon be your valentine and my shit be Columbine
My fans is all I need
But If you don't know anything just know I got some weed

Chorus
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
(x2)
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
(x6)
