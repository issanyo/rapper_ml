[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Uh! And everything be everything
Plus a nigga pullin' hoes they on me like they weddin' ring
Go and let your titties hang
Go and set your pussy free
Go and let your booty swing
Arch your back and lose your pain
Then she be like where he go
Probably with my other ho
Best believe she bring me more
Best believe I need my dough
Penthouse on the seventh floor
This your house, this my dick
This your lip, this your couch
Show me what that talk about
Go ahead and run your mouth
She on one
On my pole like track and field she in it for the long run
Take your ass up out this world get introduced to stardom
Pullin' hoes up off the bench my nigga but you had started them
Hmm, and they waist look like we starve 'em
Ass hold that baby fat, damn, where they do that at
Damn, seen her momma back
Damn, now I'm feelin' that
Beatin' on that pussy like producers call me battle cat

[Hook]
Everytime we hit the scene man them bitches fallin' out
Everytime we on the scene man them birds be fallin' out
Everytime we hit the scene have them chickens fallin' out
Everytime we on the scene man them hoes be fallin' out
If you Chevy revvin' clean, then she should put in work
If your swagga really clean, then she should put in work
If your sneakers really clean, then she should put in work
If your temporary clean, then she should put in work
You always talk about it

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
They be like damn, where they do that at
Damn, hey who made your hat
Damn, hey who did your tat
Shit I want my money back
Damn, heard you pay the stack
Damn, how much for your kicks
Damn, I ain't payed for shit
Damn I know that got you pissed
Damn, bet I bust your bitch
Damn, bet I got some weed
I put your ho at ease
Cracked her like policies
Adopted a cold heart they call me Foster Freeze
I can make it snow, brr, you just a breeze
Nigga please, I'm managed by the bees
They love me overseas
That's word to Japanese
Now I'm coming to America they owe me cheese
A bunch of bad broads, bet they pay me fees
It's pimpin' ho, you know whassupper
Taxin' you every Friday you Mrs. Tucker
Suck the nut off my head she drain me like a sewer
Think I'm Big Meech, I been Larry Hoover!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Uh! We movin' forward we ain't lookin back
So I gotta get some sneakers everytime I cop a hat
Superstylistic hat, Southern playalistic rap
Saw her titties, saw graffiti, read my name, I'm on perhaps
And her ass be overlap, out of shape and overfat
On the job I'm takin' apps
Blew my mind right through my cap
I just wanna chill with you
You just wanna throw it back
So go 'head throw it back, bust it open throw it back
Bustin' hoes ain't nothin' Jack
Shut your mouth and show your stats
Still ain't seen a proven fact
Always hear your chitty chat
We be stuntin' never frontin' nigga cause they know we on
You be stuntin' always frontin' cause I shit your favorite song
You played out like reggaeton, now you mad at me and shit
She said I'm her favorite dick, best believe she savour it
You be actin' with them actors straight pretendin' guaranteed
She ripped my landing as we toast to new beginnings now that pussy gone

[Hook]

[Outro]
Uh! Uh! And everything be everything
Plus I keep the baddest hoes they on me like they wedding ring
Go and let your titties hang
