[Hook]
Mami, I know you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could get me, don't you?
You should call me Uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand
That Astro fly
Outside of churches eatin' chicken and fries
Holler at your Uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand

[Verse 1]
I put that on my daughter though
Posted up on the block, on 54th and Figueroa
For really though, scratchin' off the cereal
Plus, you know the distress from Vermont to Imperial
Chopper go dum-dum to six in your abdominal
Seats in the whip tan, remind you of a cantaloupe
I'm lyin' though, just workin' on my grandma, ho
Physique on the ass cool, we rubbin' on the camel toe
I'm still on the same block with the same niggas that sell rock
Stashed Glocks on 'em, fuck a stash box
Astro fitted on, I'm a beast of nature
Run up in your crib, schemin' just to get the paper
BlackBerry on, shit, shall I carry on
About this young talented or this barbarian
Comin' off the top, hotter than a coffee pot
When it's drippin' off the stove, realeast nigga in control

[Hook]
