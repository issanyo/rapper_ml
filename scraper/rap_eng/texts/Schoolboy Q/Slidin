No you don’t be sliding
My nigga you lying, you know you ain’t riding (hah)
No you don’t be sliding
My nigga you lying , you know you be hiding
Hah, bitch
When it’s on then it’s on man that shit got real
I was on my last song man that shit got real
Life feeling hella lonely man that shit got real
Keep a hoe in my phone man that shit got real
Mama kicked me out the house man that shit got real
Now I’m living at my granny house that shit got real
Gotta keep a 9 piece man that shit got real
You can die in my street man that shit got real

[Verse 1: Traffic]
I do this for the riders
I do this for my pops dead and gone and my locs on momma
And my momma, and my kids
On Fig’ I be doing my shit
If I ain’t selling dope then I’m selling your bitch
My ambitionz as a rider on my 2Pac shit
All blue everything so you know I’m a crip
All blue everything you can tell I’m a crip
Keep the 9 on my hip just in case a nigga trip
Man that shit get real I suggest you keep it still
Keep it real with your peeps
If not you gon’ die in the streets
My house the gang house if there’s beef
We about 50 deep
I’m D. Wade with the heat
No wonder you ain’t coming outside
Every single hollow gon’ fly

On the gang you ain’t ever seen a Loc this real
We don’t flash guns we poppin’ when shit get real
Niggas shootin’ at my granny house ‘cause shit got real
It’s all good I heard yesterday them boy’s got killed
When I was six I never thought my life would be like this
I miss backflips and chili on my Frito chips
Got a dollar in my pocket with the same old drave
Get rich or grab the 9 load and do my thing
Niggas talking that talk but never caught that fade
[?] I’ll beat this case
Keep a mask and 2 gloves when I’m around your wave
I just might be in your hood you don’t buy my tape
Niggas stay in my pockets like they built this shit
Don’t even know my last name trynna lead my ship
Trynna play me like a chump bet your ass get popped
Ghetto Bird stay on the block ‘cause this shit stay hot (what!)

I be posted on the killer when shit get real
Ask about me on a mission bitch I bounce out wheels
I was stucking in the fields when shit got real
That’s when a nigga went down, couldn’t post no bill
Nothing realer than that,  yeah that shit got real
So you can’t talk how I talk, you can’t live where I live
It is what it is, yeah this shit get’ real
Keep it a 100 or nothing, that’s a hell of a deal
I’mma ride till the wheels fall off
These niggas only riding till the peels run out
Watch how many hollows when them shells come out
But when that still come out, that’s when the real come out
All the tough guys dip when the bitch come out
‘Cause when this shit gets real that’s when them sticks come out
Everything scandals like a lick in the drought
Yeah this nigga my plug, but this’ what I’m about
It’s real
