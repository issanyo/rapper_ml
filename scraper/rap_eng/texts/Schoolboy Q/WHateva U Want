[Intro: Candice Pillay & ScHoolboy Q]
Now it's time to make our mind, oh babe
I don't feel a thing
You got the right one, 2 step Can I rock with ya? Can I smoke with ya?

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Tryna give you an upgrade
Cherry bottles, Dior shades
Take my debit and go cray
Spend, spend every dollar, all way
Turn your closet to a driveway
Your old nigga was the old days
Broke times in a broke place
Teary eyed with the pout face
You can get it how you want it, my love
Small shoppin', hope a hundred thousand enough
Benz, Benz, want the rims on the truck
Girl you livin' a no, stayin' or go?
Whatever you want

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q & Candice Pillay]
Hey! Cribbo in the Hills
Table full of bills
Dollar dollar bills
Whatever you want
I can make it real
We, we can split a mil'
Prolly sellin' pills
Dollar dollar bills
Whatever you want
Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you
Whatever you want
Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Nice cars, caviar, whatever you want
Whatever you want

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Good weed and pain pills
Big boy, we bringin' in big mills
Every dollar dollar bill caught wheels
Crib in the Hills if you call us, Net, chill
Fly around the world, girl you livin' or not?
We used to run from the cops, now we buyin' the blocks
Started ballin' like I said I would
Came up in the game I love
If you backed it you must get cuffed
So cold with the cobra love
Now I'm never in the hood enough
Had to get up off my ass to get it
Want it, pick it, tag, clip it, yeah

[Pre-Hook: Candice Pillay]
Nice cars, caviar, you can have it all
Palm trees, bomb weed, whatever you want
Pino Grigio Noir, you can have it all
Teeth Gold, bankroll, whatever you want

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q & Candice Pillay]
Hey! Cribbo in the Hills
Table full of bills
Dollar dollar bills
Whatever you want
I can make it real
We, we can split a mil'
Prolly sellin' pills
Dollar dollar bills
Whatever you want
Whatever you, you, you, you, you, you
Whatever you want
Whatever you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
Nice cars, caviar, whatever you want
Whatever you want

[Outro: Candice Pillay]
I don't need your money, honey
I just want your love
Make it, tasty, nasty, crazy
Give it all you got
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love
Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love
