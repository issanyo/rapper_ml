[Hook]
Lift me up (x16)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock still liftin' it up
Talk shit, get rushed and they pickin' you up
Top Dawg, Money Game, salute us bitch
Pay homage to beasts of this US shit
I ain't shortin' low, but hey they know
Jay mothafuckin' Rock controllin' the whole coast
Bitch ass niggas, they don't want me to blow
I see why you bitch niggas is broke
And Imma tell you somethin', keep my name in your mouth
Imma run up on you, put this thing in your mouth
Im a real nigga, yeah they know what I'm about
Even though I'm signed, niggas still livin' wild
Bad bitches love me, when they see me yeah they bow
I don't give 'em thous', give 'em dick then I'm out
West Coast Predator, everyday is like chow
Won't B-5, put your whole career in the clouds

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We came in this industry, we screamin' fuck y'all
'Till I came on the industry, you see me grip my balls
Here I go again, lost one, never
More wins than Chicago weather
New year, new endeavor
Reach goals better than David Beckham, out of control
Kick it to my shoe, glued to your rectum, your asshole
Californ-I-A,  till I disintegrate interstate 105
We ride, you imitate
We eliminate anybody that penetrate any kind of negative vibe

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Temperature rise
Southern Cali sun, shades over eyes
Never wear suits, but keep corporate ties
Like i do (Who are you?)
Soul brother, number deuce, Lil Petrusse
I be over the edge like Q in Juice
Through and through, back to back hits like profile views
Or fiends strung out, keep watchin'
I bring the heat to your closet, make your team run out
Honest, I gets down and I look at the chronic and say

[Hook]

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
I'm in the 745 and I call it the Black Knight
My music get you high, remind me of crack pipes
Flip ya boy up, before they stitch ya boy up
And we stump ya homie out, they won't pick ya boy up
I ain't playin with 'em, I'll choke you dummy
We in the streets, tryna get this Oprah money
So you better give me mine, cause I'd love to take it from ya
You internet bangers, we bangin' out around ya
