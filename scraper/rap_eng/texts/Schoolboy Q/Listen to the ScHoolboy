[Intro: DJ Ill Will]
Once again this your boy DJ Ill Will
Top Dawg E-N-T
Getting every dolla I-N-C
Can't knock my man ScHoolboy Q
Yo you're gettin' it
Jump on the bandwagon while you can
DJ Ill Will

[Verse 1]
You're now listening to the greatest, the illest, the realest
Up in this town, going down, for the block I hold it down
50 is where I be at, H, Crowns, and Tee Hats
Notorious, Hoover Street, where you scared to be at
Niggas don't impress me, shit, I let the tec speak
Let's see actually, no rapper match me
Understand, I'm the man, California i'm the land
Grinding everyday on my own, fuck a helping hand
Sitting in the trap spot, chopping up the crack rock
Keep a quarter piece up in my mouth in case the cops watch
Got to keep the Glock cocked, in case I gotta pop shot
Throw a fiend a rock up on the ground like it's hopscotch
Neck got stupid tats, I done been through hell and back
Graduated from Meth C, Uni of selling crack
Pay attention to the facts, realest in the game
All these rappers sound the same, what's my motherfucking name?
Q!
