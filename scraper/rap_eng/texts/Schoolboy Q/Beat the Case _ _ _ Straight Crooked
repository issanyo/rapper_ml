Pt. I: Beat the Case

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Doeburger! (Ayy man)
Head swingin' like Rambo, he be spittin' like he pullin' triggers
Make an enemigo an example, and I bet I beat the case
Lot of guys with the gavels, look em' right up in they face
While a nigga under oath
Plead the fifth, then ask if I can smoke
Burnin' dirty money but I keep
A little something for the clean escape
And the rainy day after
Don't forget a nigga live where the heat wave at ya
And ya safe ain't safe
If ya heat don't wave back but life is cold that way
Ayy man

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell, all I do is beat the case

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Got my cHopper, went to Cape, bullets flying out tHe case
Only witness is the gate, notHing sticking on the tape
All I do is beat tHe, uH, yeaH, sHit you grabbin' ain't a bag
The sHit you makin' it ain't Half, of wHat I made up in tHe past
Groovy Tony witH tHe moves, uH
My bank account done ate a moose, uH
WHy tHe car ain't got a roof, uH
Crib ceiling got a boost, uH
Black Hippy witH tHe caps lock, wHen my album came..
Best album out in Hip Hop and I'm still Heatin' up tHe crockpot
Platinum plaques tHat I ain't Hung yet
You got opinions no acHievements
Type of niggas make me laugH, uH
Hit tHe gas and turn to flasH, uH
Palms itcHing like a rasH, uH
My trigger finger be tHe stasH, uH
BitcH I'm blankin' out tHe face, uH
(All I do is beat tHe case)

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell, all I do is beat the case

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Let me set the record straight, you got 10 commandments
33 amendments over 20,000 laws
Raise your hand if you think you'll beat the case
Motherfuck a Bill of Rights, I need a bil', a mil' is light
Phenergan up in my sprite, I ain't sippin' Miller light
I like to say my lighter white
Lit the spliff and went to space
Then I'm playin' with the white
What an interracial date
I made a right up at the light
Got perked up by the jakes
Had the work tucked, guns in the truck
Licenses suspended, but remember

[Chorus: Ab-Soul]
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, all I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case, I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell, all I do is...

Pt. II: Straight Crooked

[Verse: Ab-Soul]
Ruffled up a couple feathers when I called Barack a puppet yo
Now that Trump is POTUS
I know this whole election is just another Muppet Show
That ain't even none of my business though
Whatever's your cup of tea
Even lil' Niemah voted for Hillary
I'm a entity, never mind my identity
My king Slim hit me with a quote that sticked with me
A criminal's best asset is his liability
(That was crazy, lie-ability)
Do What Thou Wilt nigga (Soul!)
Cause these niggas'll have you swim across the ocean
Just to drown you in a lake
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Word, word yea, just to make sure I was straight
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight

[Bridge]
I wonder if you was crooked though reality's awake
I had to do some crooked shit to make sure I was straight
I wonder if you was crooked though reality's awake
I had to do some crooked shit to make sure I was straight

[Outro]
Don't sock him, Ali
The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy
In a sense, we all guilty, yeah
YMF nigga
