[Intro]
Calling all the girls with the heels, preferably the ones with the ass
Tell me girl are those titties real? Sorry, but a nigga had to ask
Calling all the girls with the heels, preferably the ones with the ass
No, I don't live in the hills, but a nigga do got swag

[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes you can see I'm gone
Girl, do you know what type of flow I'm on?
Word around town that I'm still unknown
How the fuck that sound?
Since I came up all the fucks bow down
But anyway you see this new style I found?
Looking for a boss so my dick can drown
Put in all in hit it 'til she sounds
What you know about Q?
Bitch, I brought the mothafuckin' gangstas back
What you know about Q?
Bitch, I left the turf and I still be strapped
Still on the scene with a bunch of bitches
Too many on my team need extra benches
One at a time, yeah, I fucks 'em senseless
Give me blow job be my apprentice

[Bridge]
You sexy girl, you sexy girl, let me rock your world
Get real nasty and lick your pearl
And do the little thing where you make it twirl
You sexy girl, you sexy girl, yeah, I said it right
Everything in life comes with a price
Now drop it like it's hot and let me fuck tonight

[Hook]
Me and you, one time for the bitches
Me and you, bring a friend to be a witness
Get them digits, texting-texting
Dog or not, you guessing-guessing
At my crib, I'm flexing-flexing
All night long, we sexting-sexting
Sexting-sexting (I'mma tap that ass)
Sexting-sexting (I'mma tap that ass)
Sexting-sexting (I'mma tap that ass)
All night long, we sexting-sexting (I'mma tap that ass)

[Break]
Says she never been with a star and I can tell she never met a G
Now get your pretty ass in the car and please don't get ya pussy on my seats
Says she never been with a star and I can tell she never met a G
Bitch, do you know who I are? Ain't a new nigga fucking with me

[Verse 2]
If you wanna hang out then you gotta blow tree
If you wanna stay then you gotta bring three
One more thing, yo, they gotta all drink
Another heads up, yo, they gotta all freak
Twist another wood then we pass it around
Take ya to the crib unfasten your gown
Yeah, I'm tryna hit, don't flake on me now
I ain't tryna hear you ain't sext in a while
What you know about Q?
Bitch, I brough the mothafuckin' gangstas back
What you know about Q?
Bitch, I left the turf and I still be strapped
Still on the scene with a bunch of bitches
Walking through the mall and they blow me kisses
Scratching on my balls probably caught me limping
Figueroa boy, so you know it's pimping

[Bridge + Hook]
