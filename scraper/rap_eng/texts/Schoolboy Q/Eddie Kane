[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Top rack nigga and the money came with it, huh
New bitch with me, Hope the booty came with it
Came with it, uh, yeah, rims flying down the road, huh
Five in the morning, feds knockin' on my door, huh
Toilet full of dope, while my burner knee high
Tell me put the gun down, I'm probably gonna die
I know, I know, big guns sell dope
Eddie Kane's little bro, hundred k, one whip, hah

[Bridge: Dem Jointz]
Open Eddie Kane for hire
Been tryna get rich for hours
Nights like this I wish
Cocaine drops would fall, woo, woo, woo, woo...

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, uh, yo, uh
Need a car with no mileage
Kristoff on my palate
My cigar full of cabbage
Came from the dirt to the carrots
Getting dirty dollars
Four different baby mommas
Dope between the speakers
So fuck you mister teacher
Cause the paper, I ace it
Lead, they tried to erase it
But I'm still standing
They mad at everything
Nothing given, I'ma take it first
On the trees like a hammock
Flip the work behind the campus
Young Groovy turn your hood into a movie (into a movie...)
Gang bang it, don't slang it
GTA-ing, shoot the whole club up
Fuck tryna sneak the K in
On the road to riches
Thank you Mister Reagan
You helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that fucked up the family
That shit that you was smokin'
I was pushin', residue lie on the cushion
I'ma blame it on your ass cause I ain't gettin' whoopings
And your proof is in the pudding
I'm just grandma's baby, Eddie Kane
(Eddie Kane, Eddie Kane)

[Bridge: Dem Jointz]
Standing in the white light
And we on
And is there any other smokers in here?
And we on
And is there any other smokers in here?
And we on
Is there any other smokers in here?
Keys open doors on the road to my heart
Dreams on the floor, bet a nigga stay high
And I know
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo
What makes the world go 'round, go 'round? Woohoo

[Outro: Candice Pillay]
Walk right into the light
Getting a feeling in the night
[?] spice
You're my only Christ
I have only eyes for you
I have only eyes for you
Your soul is mine
Your soul is mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
