[ScHoolboy Q Talking]
Wassup nigga?
Where you bout to go nigga?
Oh yeah? To the store?
Aite here nigga, bring me some Doritos
You can't put 50 cent more to it?
You know a nigga doing bad, look out for your young nigga one time

[Hook]
I'm just hoping for a better day
Prayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today
Sell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid
So I... smoke to take the pain away
So I... smoke to take the pain away
Hell yeah I'm feeling made tonight
Just got 20 dollars getting blazed tonight, right

[Verse 1]
I'm just happy just to wake up
Without a dime can't put the folgers in the cup
Tried to get a buck, so I hit a little slut
Phone turned off, can't even hit her up
A nigga feeling kinda stressed out
Walk down the block see my nigga stretched out
Can't even pout, more to reminisce about
Paying my condolences up at his sister house
Heading to the laundromat to wash a little clothes
Instrumental playin' kick a little flows
Say whats up to my bro's
Whatup groove, cuz all of that
Anyway I'm headin' to the drier after that see my supplier
Shit, hopefully a nigga come up on some fire
But remember not a dime on me
Tryna get a dime homie
I swear to God, I ain't lyin' homie

[Hook]
I'm just hoping for a better day
Prayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today
Sell dope for a rainy day, but the pigs love to keep the boy afraid
So I... smoke to take the pain away
So I... smoke to take the pain away
Hell yeah I'm feeling made tonight

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wanna call my momma up
But every time I call seems she don't give a fuck
I guess its just the luck, people always leave me stuck
Wanna break down but gotta keep pushin' up
What the fuck a only child can do
Gramds passed away, mom's said go on through
Only thing I got is my girl and my dogs
Swear to god i don't wanna lose it all
I got homies, I don't think they ridin' to the end
Niggas fake as fuck lookin' past all they grins
Just tryna get some ends, hopefully can get a Benz
And I'll do this shit just to keep them niggas in
I just need a lil bread bro
Tryna pay my momma hopefully get a kiss yo
This shit can really make you sick though
I just wanna go....

[Verse 3]
I don't see how you niggas do it
Saying cuz/blood, little nigga sound foolish
Little nigga murdered, hangin' out at Fatburger
Another tattoo, time to take the beef further
Ran down the block, thought I heard a couple shots
Made it to the scene, another nigga off the team
Back to gettin' cream, still relyin' on the fiends
Wish I could take it back to when a nigga had a dream
But gangbangin' love to enter nigga's lifes
So your life ain't right
Young gauge earnin' strips (?)
Started puffin drugs then you start sayin cuhz
Didn't have a choice that's the way shit was
I swear I need to set it to the side
But when I hear Pac make a nigga wanna ride
I guess I'm a hypocrite, still hangin' with the hypo-crips

[Hook]
I'm just hoping for a better day
Prayin' to the Lord, hope to call me up today

So I... smoke to take the pain away
