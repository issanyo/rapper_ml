[Intro: Schoolboy Q]
I done traveled the word nowadays
And all these groupie hoes on my dick, on my dick
Just chillin', lollygaggin' around and these hoes still know my shit
Cause I'm that shit

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Bounce, stepped in the club with a ounce
Gettin' high 'til the sunrise, thugs in the house
Stacks to the ceilin', nigga, not a bit of fillin'
Young nigga with a attitude, but not a better villain
Get a million, I'm illin', couple Swishers and I'm chillin'
Make a bitch feel good, pussy hole, fill it
Believe it, Top Dawg, so they want to breathe it
Bad bitch pussy-eater, so they want to (-) it
If she wearin' Prada, then I got to take her outta
And if she wearin' Louis, then I'm grippin' on her booty
Bring it to me, bring the camera out and, baby, film a movie
Pussy gooey, rock the microphone, so now the hoes pursue me
Gettin' every dollar just to make the hoes holler
Top Dawg scholar, known rock and roller
Greedy than a bitch, so a bitch gettin' nada
Just dick, hold this, tell a bitch, 'Quick, swallow'

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
I done traveled the word nowadays
And all these groupie hoes on my dick, on my dick
Just chillin', lollygaggin' around and these hoes still know my shit
Cause I'm that shit

Gangsta rapper, but a different note
Thug rapper with spectacular flow, what it sound like?
Every dollar, yeah, I'm reppin' it though
Top Dawg still rockin' the show, so it sounds like this

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
A young nigga with the hot shit
Lick a bitch down real quick cause the flow sick
A ghetto nigga with the right sticks
Priceless, still the shit, nigga, that's a cold stint
VIP where I be, lookin' real big
Eyes real low, off a little X
Need a little sex, nutted on the breast
Move to the next, relieve more stress
Fuckin' bitches good, said they got a Q fetish
Smooth way I talk had my fuckin', all the feelings
Have a friend jealous, young nigga so rebellious
Pussy cover up the hair like umbrellas
G.E.D., Top Dawg, young nigga's flawless
Fuckin' different girls, different states, all Georgias
Hoes all marvelous, tour bus lights'll get the hoes feelin' hyper
Pussy target, dick a sniper

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]

[Verse 3: K-Boy]
What you know about a gangsta?
Yeah, they swimmin', love this thug shit
They keep callin' me and beggin' for this thug dick
Treat you like I seen you in Jay Rock video
(-) video and Nipsey video, so I hit it like (-)
Let's go to the room, so I can dig in your (-)
Prince of the city, yeah, he is me
And I'm gettin' every dollar like G.E.D
I fuck with Top Dawg, but I ain't talkin' 'bout Snoop
The only Crip nigga looks fly in a suit
Fresh white tee, blue belt, new Gucci
She say she love gangstas, bang that movie
She told me, 'K-Boy, baby, you so cute'
Cause I know Tyga and Schoolboy Q
But I don't really trip cause I know that I'm the shit
So I give 'em thirty minutes of this East Side dick

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
