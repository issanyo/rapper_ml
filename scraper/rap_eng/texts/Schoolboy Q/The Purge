[Intro: Joy]
My daddy said drown, nigga

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
As this G shit begin, put this product placement on your chin
The realest nigga breathing, y'all pretend
Real Crippy since I hopped off the swing
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yeah, uh, yeah)
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome
Now nah, I ain't on no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm Cripping
Niggas rap about what I'm living, all this false claiming, I'm marring
Doing drive-bys I ain't steering, white funerals, I ain't tearin'
Fuck your bitch in front of your children
Steal your whip side of my building, yeah
Put my dick and nuts in her mouth, bust in her hair
I'm very rare, got my trigger on top of my underwear
Bitch, I'm everywhere and over there
You die here, let off a pair (YAWK, YAWK)

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
House full of kilos, sold pound to zeros
Cocaine my hero, you in Figg Side, getting Deeboed
Always asking for the burner like, young niggas still free load
Heart big as my ego, don't fly around my signal
I'll rearrange your dental, Crippy my house shoes
Blue rag disciples, murder I'm liable, you get the Eiffel
Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the strike once
Won't get the strike twice, you niggas half price
Which means you half off, I'm going Adolf
I'm smoking bath salt, two sherm sticks, burn this, ooh
Knock-knock through the condo's, Schoolboy from the five deuce
But Hoover respect to you unranked, don't fuck around, get that chin banged
Groovelining, Crip walk the whole mile
Blue Belts, still my pants down, Chuck Taylors, Cortezes, hush puppies
My Glock, yeah, fuck buddy, make money, take money
Earn crack money, drug money, bail money
Heard they got life for me, but how they got life for me
When they took that from me, since I had my nose runny
I was out past sunny, had the strap by my tummy
You can go and ask mommy, grab a body bag, homie, yeah

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Bust my gun all by myself
Rock cocaine all by myself
Poured propane all on myself
Go so hard might harm myself

[Interlude: Schoolboy Q]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, it's Kurupt young mothafucking Gotti
Still rolling in a 6, I don't fuck with the Bugatti
Come up in this mothafucka looking for a bitch
She probably sucked on my dick then you kissed her on the lips
The integral, South Central sentinel
Get roped and choked, poetical tentacles stretch (ha ha ha ha)
Get roped and choked and rope-a-doped
Extra overdose of the oki-doke
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about
They walked 'em in, I walked 'em out
They talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out
Now cock back that Oxy (Pow-pow, pow-pow)
Walk inside, pistols popping, top is popping off
Papadopoulos neighborhood, rolling 60 balls
Ghetto tribalist, squeezing pussies like octopuses
Nigga, show me where the money at, show me where the kush is
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes
This is the reasons why I won't be fucking with pussies like you
Me, Tyler, and Schoolboy Q, we told 'em

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Pow, pow, pow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Mothafucka, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
