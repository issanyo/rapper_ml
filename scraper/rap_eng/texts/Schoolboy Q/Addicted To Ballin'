[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, hoe!

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Addicted to ballin', I have to get my cash
The money is callin', got bands, got bands, got bands
I'm addicted to ballin' (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I'm addicted to ballin' (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I have to get my ends

[Verse 1: Kamaiyah]
I pull up in my Benz (woah)
Flexin' countin' my bands (woah, woah)
Started gettin' money, I see how it feels to be rich (woah, woah)
I live by the beach now (woah, woah)
That's how a boss should live (woah, woah)
Since I was a toddler, I knew that I would become this (woah, woah)
I cannot move slow (woah, woah)
That's a big, big no (woah, woah)
Gotta chase this money, bankroll after big bankroll
I must get this money (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I must get this money (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I must get this money (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
Get this money, get this money

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Addicted to ballin', I have to get my cash
The money is callin', got bands, got bands, got bands
I'm addicted to ballin' (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I'm addicted to ballin' (I, I, I, I, I, I, I)
I have to get my ends

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Huh, got a hunnid hoes I need bands (woah, woah)
Drunk as fuck now look at my dance (woah, woah)
Where the bitches at? This my jam (my jam)
Fuck around and get you that Benz

Used to hide the Glock in my Nautica
Nigga know the money be callin' us (yeah, yeah)
Fuck a friend, I'm tryna fuck all of y'all

Bitches start to love me too quick (too quick)
Went to Oakland with a few crips (loc)

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Addicted to ballin', I have to get my cash
