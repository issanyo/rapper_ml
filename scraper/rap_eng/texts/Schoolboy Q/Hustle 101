[Hook]
This is what I do, turn nothin' into somethin'
If it ain't about money, man you ain't sayin' nothin'
And you may catch me OT tryna flip though
You run up, say hello to my pistol
I rock it up, chop it up, I'm tryna move somethin'
I hit the stash, grab the bag, gotta do somethin'
And once I get it, I'ma flip it, stack it up or somethin'
I'm 'bout my money man, 'bout my money, man

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Seen quiet days, loud nights
Made it easy for the boys to raid, spray their ass with Raid
Dawg I ain't sayin' shit
Bread, look, I can teach you how to flip
Look, uh, hustle 101
First get a gun, hop out, make all them niggas run
Two, look, make it to the dope spot
But watch out for the cops, aye, watch out for the wooptie
Third, get an 8 ball to test it out
Make sure that this your route, if it don't work, tell 'em it's a drought
Fourth, look, shit I ain't goin' back to fourth
You better have that bread or shit, it's over with your head
Realist shit I ever said, nigga money over dead
Hoes you'd rather fuck instead, now repent
Death among gents, smack 'em senseless and six inch shit
I told him keep his distance, relentless for instance

[Hook]
This is what I do, turn nothin' into somethin'
If it ain't about money, man you ain't sayin' nothin'
And you may catch me OT tryna flip though
You run up, say hello to my pistol
I rock it up, chop it up, I'm tryna move somethin'
I hit the stash, grab the bag, gotta do somethin'
And once I get it, I'ma flip it, stack it up or somethin'
I'm 'bout my money man, 'bout my money, man

[Verse 2: Jem Cretes]
First you gotta move out of state with a tool
Catch a knot, turn a rule, when them sharks in the pool
Feds on attack where we clack for the food
Hustle 101: every day cash rules
This is how I'm pitchin', every day gettin'
My vision's so gangsta, my niggas so anchored
I'm from the trap house where the gats out, bitter
We cash out sisters and we man out niggas
Wilmington's the city but I move so gritty
So quickly, no iffy, no murder, no pity
I'm I-made, five way, and niggas wanna try J
Highways on Friday, like Cube, it's my day
Bitch niggas comin' short, Debo through your whole source
Fuck niggas wanna clown, nigga I can muscle down
Nigga you ain't from my town, you hustle like your momma now
Your hustle with a swallow now, open up, gobble down

[Hook]
This is what I do, turn nothin' into somethin'
If it ain't about money, man you ain't sayin' nothin'
And you may catch me OT tryna flip though
You run up, say hello to my pistol
I rock it up, chop it up, I'm tryna move somethin'
I hit the stash, grab the bag, gotta do somethin'
And once I get it, I'ma flip it, stack it up or somethin'
I'm 'bout my money man, 'bout my money, man
