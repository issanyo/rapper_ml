[Intro: Miles Davis & Mac Miller]
1, 2, 3, pop, pop
1, 2, 3, pop, pop
1, 2, 3, pop, pop

1, 2, 3, pop, pop (okay)
Yeah, okay, okay
Okay, okay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay-kay
Okay, okay, yeah, um

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty reg—ular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car (skrt)
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And everyday it's full of jokers like a deck of cards (hahaha)
Swear, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece (dome-piece)
But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
Cause we out here winning, brought my dogs from out the reservoir (Hoo!)
And I'mma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts (okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (ahh)
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the V-M-A's, told a joke - he never laughed (uh)
The rap diablo, free your mind my motto
And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto (we’re motherfuckin’ rich!)
So arigato, so shit, you know I'm world famous
And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest (world’s greatest!)
But still to fall in love is like an orgasm
Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (play it)
Thank God that I made it (made it), ask Q where Dave is (where is he?)
He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas (7 minutes!)
Me I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet (ching)
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder
And Clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
(Hi Sven, isn't this your language?)
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it, shit
It's just a little cocaine sniff (sniff)
But the lines is longer than parades is (aahhh)
I think it's time to give me all your praises (praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (raises)
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit
And if you wanna legal battle, send your ass to David (that's my lawyer)
I'm half man-half amazing
Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations (don't make no sense)
I know the planet Earth is about to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

[Hook: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah, Miller Mac, Miller Mac, haha, yeah Miller Mac, these are my friends Miller Mac

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes falling on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this Game of Thrones, it is known I got the 4G
LTE connection bars, no control, fuck Ken Lamar (Fuck you Kendrick!)
I don't vote, I never registered
But I'm a magnet for them zeros call me Edward Sharpe (woo!)
I wake up feeling dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember
Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg
Talking interlocutor, and drinking Arnold Palmer
In the other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan
Laying down the baseline, doing drums with his free hand (how the hell does he do that ?!)
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though, (aw), man
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit
Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction (skrt)
With a 6-year-old she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like “fuck those cops!”
God damn, it just don't stop (nah)
I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot (puffs)
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got (Boy!)
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks

[Hook: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah, Miller Mac, Miller Mac, haha, yeah Miller Mac, these are my friends Miller Mac
Mac Miller Miller Mac, Miller Mac, Mac Mac Mac, Miller Miller Miller Miller Miller Mac
Miller Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac, Miller Mac, Miller Mac, Miller Miller Mac Mac yeah, haha
Miller Mac, Miller Mac, Miller Mac Miller Mac, I see you Mac these are my friends
Miller Miller Miller Miller Miller Miller

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yea, I've had the same outfit for 6 days straight (gross)
And still, all these bitches will get in position
Because I got their pussies all dripping in paint
Somehow, I'm making this music it's just to relate to(damn, your drownin'!)
And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection, I broke the mirror
It's only for protection (ok), shit keep getting weirder (weirder)
Now I can't see a thing but, things never been clearer
Call the Mothman it's Richard Gere (It's Richard motherfuckin' Gere!)
This is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here (be gone)
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere (ET, go home)
And looking down like we come in peace (oh, me too)
I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit (down)
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage (it's brown)
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit (grape juice!)
We were just some motherfuckin' kids

[Hook: Schoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
Yeah, Miller Mac, Miller Mac, haha, yeah Miller Mac, these are my friends Miller Mac
