[Verse 1: Drake]
A nigga got a woosah
Comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got'em all in check without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick, got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' Shower Posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yeah
The game turn me into this guy, yeah
And now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A the shit is way out
But these days, that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB dat my brother like a Wayans
Ya know I only show up if you payin' , nigga
Yeah, I always been on, I always been 2 on
For like the five past years
All these niggas wanna shine, I got a flashlight here, mayne
Bout' to hit the gas right here, mayne
Old soul livin' in a past life here, mayne
You, bring the cash right here, mayne
Miracles, sit your ass right here, mayne
Mayne, you know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yeah, OVO sound, man, that's every day
It's Young Money Records, get the record straight

[Hook: Tinashe]
Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'till I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll
I love to get 2 on, I love to
Let-let-let's roll
Let-let-let's roll

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Yea we can get active
And all my bitches attractive
We go, you know who we are now
Get high, hotbox in my car now

[Pre-hook: Tinashe]
If you a lame, nigga you ain't making no noise
Get faded, turn up with the big boys
Live fast, die young that's my choice
Get money, get money like an invoice
We can mob all in the whip
Make the money make a grip
I be stuntin' with my clique
Getting faded 'till we trip (oh)

[Hook: Tinashe]
Man, I love to get on
I love to get 2 on
When the drink be too strong
When the tree be way too strong
Get faded, turn up, bruh
Pour it on up 'till I can't even think no more
Get ratchet, go dumb then go more dumb then
We can keep it lit, let's roll
I love to get 2 on
Let-let... let's roll
I love to get 2 on, I love to
Let-let-let's roll
Let-let-let's roll

[Bridge: Tinashe]
Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya

And my enemies, they see me living now
And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh

[Hook: Tinashe]
