[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Never had a mothafuckin' weed card
I'm down to flatline a nigga, never been soft
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
I was thirteen with my mothafuckin' heat, y'all
Nigga caught cases tryna take your fuckin' screen off
I could put your fuckin' life on the recall, uh, yeah
Lookin' for the bitches with the ass
Got an icey chain cause a nigga gettin' cash
Three different pagers blowin' up because I'm crackin'
Tryna turn a dollar to a million, ho, what's happenin'?
O-orange laces, for my shoestrings
Pistol on me, dope is in her g-string
Ridin' in my mothafuckin' Coupe-Ville
Groovin' with my mothafuckin' locs still
Fig side niggas keep a dope fiend
Ghetto bird hit a kid like ghetto hoop dreams
Tryna strike me out before I finish school
I was just a square nigga 'til I took my 52, oh, yeah, ayy

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Sam Dew]
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all, ah, on me, though
We love, we go, we rise, we low
Our pride, we show, we love, we go

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, John
Tryna get this mothafuckin' weed off
Gang injunction tell me where we can't go
Shoot me in my back because my afro
Heard I got a strike on my record then it's true
Cops effin' at my record, never told 'em what I knew
I was in my nigga car garage, yeah, I'm tryna shoot
I was out here sellin' dope at 14, what it do?
I was out here fuckin' hoes at 14, what it do?
I was ditchin' class, fifth grade, yeah, I'm Groovy Q
Ain't no biggie when the small nigga rob, gimme loot
Pop a nigga on his mom's porch, kill his brother too
Nigga lost his first fade nine years after school
Nigga tryna get the Js, blue Chucks sick as flu
Runnin' from the crash unit like my name was State Farm
On my nigga's handlebars tryna get our groove on, yeah

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Sam Dew]
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, ah, on me, though
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, ah, on me, though
We love, we go, we rise, we low
Our pride, we show, we love, we go

[Outro: ScHoolboy Q]
Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
B-B-Bellin', bellin', bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
B-Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Bellin', bellin' through the mothafuckin', bellin' street, y'all
B-Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Bellin', bellin', bellin'
B-Bellin' through the mothafuckin' street, y'all
Mothafuckin' street, street, street, John
