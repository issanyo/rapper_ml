[Part 1: Can't Hold My Liquor]

[Hook: Justin Vernon] (x2)
I can hold my liquor
But this man canâ€™t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Verse: BJ The Chicago Kid]
3 cups of hen and I'm on one
Came with one bitch but want all of 'em
Let's ball or somthin'
(Shit, what they lip read?)
My dick and balls or somethin'
(America was built off lies, sex, and money)
And 12K years later, that's the same exact shit here for me
(Aww this thick broad right here I'm tryna)
Break, break down
Cause this liquor breaking me on down

[Part 2: It's True]

[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
First Imma start with my nigga Al Mac
The first real nigga I lost
Even though he used to gang bang
Would never live to see his chain swing
But that's the Jesus piece loss
Cause he would have rocked it well
But instead he rocked that hair full of braids
Braided by his girl Leecy
Went to Simeon, nigga had game kinda cold
Never killed a soul
So we never had a problem with thinking this ever getting known
Living life like it never would happen
Shit, niggas dying like life really going full circle
Thought we was gonna live to see it all
Till that day that he died on a head-on collision with a motorcycle

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I met Jamico when I went to high-school
They stayed around the corner but shit, I never knew
Me and Kisel Ken in the basement playing drums, making music
While she fussy yelling down the stairs
"I'm on the phone you losers!"
I remember late for school every morning thirsty for that mickey d's
Not knowin the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated
Went to college got married
They had a pretty little girl but the world couldn't make her tardy
He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It's true, cool niggas die too
Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
