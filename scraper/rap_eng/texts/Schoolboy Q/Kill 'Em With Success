[Intro: Eearz]
Ayy, ayy
EarDrummers

[Pre-Chorus: Eearz]
That slap, they say they want that slap
It's not sold separately, they know I come with that
Hey, what you got?

[Chorus: Eearz]
Hunnids overlappin', that's a fact
I'm on my level nigga, you better come correct
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success

[Verse 1: Eearz]
Ordinary, I am not that
They think I'm blasphemous, tattoos all on the neck
Grew like a crack to me, head first 'fore a check
Gung-ho for a fistful of blue bread
Girl, that ass swole, let me grab a hold and suplex
Go for broke in that pussy 'cause I remember when
Niggas looked over me, now they all wanna recollect
Feel like some' chose me, I'm e'rythin' you could've been
If you was hustlin'
Post-dramatic, cardiac
Rollin' back to back addict , damn I'm famished
I'ma need a whole bag of the cabbage
Came straight out that damn clay, like Cassius
Shoulda seen his damn face when I passed him
Lil' boy got big waves, overstandin'
All of y'all blokes piss poor, in the trash
You lookin' at the shit now, take a whiff
These diamonds DTN

[Pre-Chorus: Eearz]
That slap, they say they want that slap
It's not sold separately, they know I come with that
Hey, what you got?

[Chorus: Eearz & (ScHoolboy Q)]
Hunnids overlappin', that's a fact
I'm on my level nigga, you better come correct
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that (woo)
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success (Yo, uh)

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Nostradamus, booked the pilot, land in tropics
Big deposits, saucy dipping, million flipping
One too many, Lambo spinning, skrrt, might crash it
Big boy habits, legend status, label classic
Can't be average, got success needed more, uh
Made the Forbes, needed more, uh
Get the Range, needa floor it, uh
Wasn't there when I was workin' for it, got it big chillin', now you mad, uh
Motivation for the young niggas, get the bag rollin' so it last, uh
Nigga ball like the Mavs, finger-roll from the half
Run the back through the trap, double time gettin' wack
Seen it all, now I done done it all
Why can't a broke nigga say, "Uh, if was 30+ in the hood, still hell yeah, I'ma hate," uh
VVSs in the face, ay
Beat the case and do the race, uh
This the Porsche, never late, uh
Headin' North to the Ace, uh
Saw my house by the waves, uh
More lead for the bang, uh
My God, need a raise, uh
New check, never change, ay (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Eearz]
That's slap, they say they want that slap
It's not sold separately, they know I come with that
Hey, what you got?

[Chorus: Eearz & (2 Chainz)]
Hundreds overlappin', that's a fact
I'm on my level nigga, you better come correct
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that (Yah)
Kill they ass with success, they won't like that
Kill they ass with success (2 Chainz)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
God bless the soldiers (Bless), rip the head off a cobra (Rip)
Intimidate the camera holder, I can taste the victory
Yeah, I can smell the aroma (Smell), hands quicker than Dayton-
Gloves on, no isotone, locked in on my opponent (Locked in)
Frontline, yeah, I'm on it
You won't believe how much I want it (Well believe)
You won't believe how much I'm focused (Well believe)
I put the mind in determine, I put the mind on a journey
That mean you leavin' on a gurney
I'm 'bout to kill 'em with success, somebody call my attorney
Hey, alright
Alright, here doubt don't exist
I will push your tea back with Malice like the Clipse
Can of ass-whoopin', I got gallons of the shit
Love or hate me, you need balance a lil' bit
Tryin' not to be violent like a challenge in itself
When it start goin' right to the left, to the left
People slept, Jesus wept
You a pet, I'm a vet
I'm a threat, where you at?
Rep the set, that's a bet
