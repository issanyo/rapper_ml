[Verse 1: SiR]
This that fire, pass a light
It'll burn slow
Casually, gradually
Defying gravity as I let go
No wires, I’m flying
Magic, right?
Pull a hat outta rabbit, right?
Never thought I could have it all
Then again I never really had it right
I'm moving through this movie like my life's duty is to live unruly you
Shoulda never introduced me to the beauty in the darker side of heaven’s view
Coogi fit her booty very well
Hopefully she never kiss and tell
Hopefully we never see the sun
Don’t try keepin' up, I’m on the run

[Chorus: SiR]
Tryna keep it humble in a world full of egos, gangsters and evils
Player in the game but I’m making my own rules
And I’m pulling up in something foreign, foreign
Yea, I’m pulling up in something foreign, foreign

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
I pulled this out for you, my newest coupe
Grip the horse, I'll take you 'round the loop
Close your eyes, your heart available
Land on earth, and cruise through Malibu
Gave you time, now give your drawers the boot
Rub the skins, I found that heaven's true
Melt the sun and keep the moon alive
Dry the winds, and moist behind the five
Can't pretend the greatest sin alive
Stroke, you come and go beyond the fake
Take you down, the frown go up your face
Arch your back and bend it back in place
Fuck you good, I'll fuck you good, I know
Snap your book to know where else to go
Foreign place, a foreign whip to drive
Failed at life, then failing you, now I'm (I'm)

[Chorus: SiR]
Tryna keep it humble in a world full of egos, gangsters and evils
Player in the game but I’m making my own rules
And I’m pulling up in something foreign, foreign
Yea, I’m pulling up in something foreign, foreign
