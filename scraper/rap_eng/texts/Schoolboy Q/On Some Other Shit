Black Hippy

[Jay Rock]
My mind traveling through different dimensions
One of the reasons why they tripping off the rhymes that I'm kicking
Like a Sensai with a black belt, I'm that felt
Give yo ass some pretty wings
I handle Macs well

[Ab-Soul]
Arm less sergeant salute me
,Ab-Soul-Loutley
On some other shit leave the booth full of dookie
Off the head like a noogie and my life's like a movie
Play your role while I roll another doobie

[Jay Rock]
To smoke
We got 'em high catch another quote
Look in my eyes, never lie boy I'm on my toes
Like a Korean with nail polish you niggas know
Acting like you don't oh fo sho
Tell 'em soul!

[Ab-Soul]
Ha ha!
You know we out your galaxy
An astrologist couldn't find a better analogy
Actually we the last of a dying breed
Living life like its prophecy entirely word up!

Black Hippy

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's all I need to get busy
Turn your music to a Frisbee
Then make your bitch frisk me (come here bitch)
You be holding rifles hoping that someone will like you
Searching for a pill like the late Michael
That's dead wrong

[Schoolboy Q]
Um...Keep my heart strung
Still fucking hoes like an off drum
Sound of a kitty cat
And it's still a rap beat
How you feel on that

[Kendrick Lamar]
Well I'll sell our music and make moves in the 50 states
The irony is I'm in Compton with foreign plates
Bumping Angel Milk, homie play your part
I be coming down, you coming up short like an Asian bill

[Schoolboy Q]
Um....I think I need to get my shit together
But whatever still flyer than the weather
Feeling myself so much
I'm sharp I need more tunes to sever
And my polos made of leather cuz

Black Hippy

[Ab-Soul]
Killing the game oh yes I am
Bringing the pain as I am
You're just a sweet potato in the pan
Top Dawg is the label when it's written on my shoulder
Top notch on my hand, I'll be such 'till its over
Say hello to the man in demand would 'ya?
They say when you hot then the fans will come
So if I say I'm cold then that's an antonym
You can't stand it huh?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yo yo
I freak a beat like a nympho when I speak
And so a syllable is like a sex between the sheet
And you can buy your vowel if you show 'em the receipt
To prove that my bars are a hundred grand large
My futures so bright you can see it in the dark
With the blindfold on the hindsight of a blind dude
I'm not cocky I'm just confident fucking raw
Before I knew what a condom is K. Lamar
