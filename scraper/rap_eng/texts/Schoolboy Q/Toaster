[Intro: Lance Skiiiwalker]
I'm gonna end the night, with these last words
Enjoy life, have fun, stay introverted
Skiiiwalker Radio

[Verse 1: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Yo baby, baby, let me show ya
Just how I roll my marijuana
Then come and take a puff or two
So special baby, wanna clone ya
Then boogie down to Barcelona
And have about a drink or two

[Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Hey girl I hope you're confident and yeah
And understand
'Cause ain't no girl replacing you

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Me fell in love with diamond boulder
My favorite girl me marijuana
We hit the lucky charm and I'm drooped

[Hook: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Hey girl I hope you're confident and yeah
And understand
'Cause ain't no girl replacing you

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
You even got me singing for ya
Me breakin' down your whole euphoria
Sucker for your love and it's true

[Lance Skiiiwalker]
Yo baby, baby, let me show ya
Just how I roll my marijuana
Then come and take a puff or two
So special baby, wanna clone ya
Then boogie down to Barcelona
And have about a drink or two
