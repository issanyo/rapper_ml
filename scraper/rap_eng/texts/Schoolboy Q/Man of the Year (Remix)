[ Instrumental ]

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Midwest home of the pimp, old schools rolled on the strip
Get fold if you trip, nine rubber grip lick when it lick
Bad chick love on the stick, lick her neck get to rubbing her tits
Hit her once in the hole, ain't got no love for the chip
Pour four, roll bud by the the stick
C-notes in the pockets from a couple of licks
My niggas came up on a couple of bricks
Chop brawl, knocking doors down when we click
Face bound, roll around with a pound of the it
Got a down little chick, she get down with her mouth and her lips
Throwing and bouncing her hips
Shake it real for the man of the year
Got her hands high like she grabbing for air
Drop top coupe as I swerve and I stare
While we screaming out...

[Schoolboy Q]
Bounce...
Uh , uh huh , bounce ... Y-y-y-yeah

[Hook]
Bruh, I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air, it's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh, man of the year, man of the... bounce


[Schoolboy Q Verse 2]
Home of the slanging on the curb
Weed cards every corner sell herb, watch ya fly to a bird
Nigga, I could pitch you a curb
Let this real shit occur, make mills from a verb
Nigga cop a crib in the burbs, nigga
You ain't said nothing but a word, smoke something for ya nerve
Home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third, bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow, every once in a while
I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
Bounce from the ground, hype for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue
Pop down from the floor... bounce

[Hook]
Bruh, I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air, it's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh, man of the year, man of the... bounce
