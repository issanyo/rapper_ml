[Verse 1]
As I enter my lifestyle
Nigga figured out my life while
Grown child, damn, life’s a bitch so I don’t smile
Still puffin’ herb just to lower my eyebrows
Eye lashes, eyes close, ears open, gun smokin’
Worst pokin’, rap’s quoting
Close your eyes to the vibe, see the pigs floating
Not a dog, kid I’m the shit, see the rhyme potent
Hmm… Never wanted to hit you with the lies
Working on my gift just to better my surprise
Tatted up my face just to better my disguise
And I’m still ghetto in the hood, chilly with the fries
Put that on the fifties, oh this rap shit is simply
Easier, fingertips greasier name in the media, encyclopidea
And this rap im spittin’ I get it in sentences
Im lyrically sentenced behind bars

[Hook]
Beat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life
Sounds like, like Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, work for something to something
To Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop yeah made a little dough from the fast life
Now im on the mic trying to spread lights it sounds like, like
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, made something from nothing with
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

[Verse 2]
These white folks they ain't care how I grew up
Gang signs threw up
Lifestyle blew up, travel different hoods
Every other curb knew us
Managed by the Bloods, though I still bang Hoover
Spittin that manure
Watch how I maneuver, buzz down in Cuba, flow like a lunatic
See the wrist iced out in this bitch, niggas know the world is mine
So your life in my fist, life real
Grinding hard just to pay the light bills
Spitting with aggression just imagine how my mic feels
Understandable why these niggas call me Hannibal Lecter
Blacked up fuck around, dissect you, top dogs protect you
Nobody is better, I give a lecture to the rest of the semester
No sleep, eyes wide open, just to let my brain speak
G-E-D Top Dog E-N-T

[Hook]
Beat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life
Sounds like, like Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, work for something to something
To Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop yeah made a little dough from the fast life
Now im on the mic trying to spread lights it sounds like, like
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, made something from nothing with
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

[Verse 3]
Huh so hip-hop got me rapped in
Punch opened up the back door, and then I crept in
Let’s in all this so nonsense rapping
Knowing that I’m living every single track I’m giving in
Paying Gucci for tuition, learn to play your position
Murdered the competition, taking you on a mission
A journey to big dreams, my life in a sixteen
We trying to trap cream, I’m done with these dope fiends
Seen

[Outro]
I don't know what it is, I don’t know
K. Dot uglier than a bitch
Punch what he do, got a bald head (laughing)
