Verse 01: DrAssenator
Hold me for something, that is my name
D.o.c - I don’t spit jokes
But I kill pussies on tha roads nigga
Hold me something, that’s Like
Traveling in tha local transport
Will make you ill-st
These mummy daddy kids are looking hype
When we feel this
We Fill their A$$ with the crack, nigga
Hol’ my self with a fat nigga
You fag nigga, you can’t tell me shit about the streets
I done lived in it, eversince I came up in this world
Came up in this world, so I hate you nigga’ absurd
Hold me something that’s my emotions
Emotions roller coaster, everytime you run
Through my brain u see, sick jokes
Hold me for something and that’s my motivation
And that’s big as a motherfuckin’  jet
You ride with them ol’ niggas
You say, you tell me about ex?
She got the number’s that come with a hummer
But I still give a dick to her
She deserved to bitch
Derversed to be bitch, so I call her bitch
Nigga, I hold me for something
She love the cream, I gave her ice cream
Nigga, fuck bitches

[Hook: Schoolboy]
Pussy lips, contraband for chips, sold all kinds of shit
Hoover Crip, guns on fingertips, switched all kinda clips
50 raised, since my county days, brought all kind of fades
Renegade, fuck what rappers say, bitch, I am LA

Verse02: DrAssenator

I got W’s in the air When I ride with my niggas
You tryna make up?
Just like my bithes wanna break up with me
Well, I make it up with me
Gotta fuck bitches/everynight
When I get cream-uh they fuckin’ tide
You can burn a rubber on  fake bitches trying to make it right
I’m Goldie, A.S.A.P – dazz my name
Motherfuckin’ gangsta with my crew
I ride with few, I pop a few
When I Ride with them ol’ niggas tryna make up with my style
They ain’t got it, they got shit
They gotta shit, to eat
I keep give’em shit to eat, We bought that cheese
Boyz in the hood are always hard you come talkin’ shit
We put you in the card you can cure my last year bitch
Infront of your balls, I can show you how to rip these bars of prison
To these pussies, motherfukaz ain’t eattin’ my style
D.o.c you better know this name
You hate me while your bitch got me on her playlist
Took by sale-es, that’s my slaes nigga

I give to eat- shit
My mind’s ill – Motherfuckin RAW..
