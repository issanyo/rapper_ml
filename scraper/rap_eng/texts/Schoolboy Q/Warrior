WARRIOR

VERSE 1 [Erreon Lee]

Rappers like, ah shit; damn a nigga back at it
Still lettin’ tracks have it, no compassion
A nigga go savage, there he go spazzin’
Ay whatever he want, just know he gon grab it

Ima say this one time, you can notepad it
I am not ya favorite rapper, he below average
Well he spittin’ a lil bit but my flow tragic
Point blank period my nigga no challenge

Game time bitch, boy I throw my cleats on
When that fuckin’ beats on, in the booth with my beats on
That boy get his beast on, not the one they should sleep on
Ay q, let these motherfuckas know what we on

CHROUS [Schoolboy Q]

I Been Grindin all day I bring the dark up to the light
Got weed in my swisher, Nigga bout to take a flight, my priorities be money, yo priorities be like uhh, nigga get the fuck up, nigga you ain't like us. Ima Muthafuckin Warrior, Ima muthafuckin Warrior, A Muthafuckin A warrior

Verse 2 [Erreon Lee]

Ok im back up on my shit, nigga what the fuck you mean I ain’t
Boy I gotta be a legend, tell me what the fuck you mean I can't
Everyday the iller he get, destined to be it
They sayin’ hes le-git, nigga he it

What was fate, was just a matter of time to em
Hard times everyday but we grind thru em
He got the city on his back like its tied to em
Completin’ any fuckin’ mission that’s assigned to em

And his fans gotta love it how he rhyme to em
But that’s probably cuz a nigga neva’ lyin’ to em
Suckas he blind to em, but he can see the light
On the other side of the tunnel likes it’s the end of life

Ima take a lot a shit but I’m ready for it
They asked was the weight of the game to heavy for em
He replied no sir, no problem
Reassure hip-hop, tell em I got em

I Been Grindin all day I bring the dark up to the light
Got weed in my swisher, Nigga bout to take a flight, my priorities be money, yo priorities be like uhh, nigga get the fuck up, nigga you ain't like us. Ima Muthafuckin Warrior, Ima muthafuckin Warrior, A Muthafuckin A warrior

Verse 3 [Erreon Lee]

Tell em this is war time, we up in the kill zone
Hope you got a shield on, boy we get our meals on
I’m on that track and I’m headed right to a bright finish
I’m here to murder the game and get a life sentence

I’m where the gangstas’ at, right there where the danger at
Look into my eyes and you probably see where the anger at
Look into my mind and see where I’m paintin’ these paintins’ at

Hip-hops not dead, the games at rest
Who’s blame is that? And who changes that?
Erreon aims at heads, they aim at chest
Ill neva turn my back on niggas held me down from scratch

Kobe ain’t the only boy can put the game up on his Back
Listen youngin’, I can show you how to handle that
Real in the field boy this where you get dismantled at
Goin’ against us is like playin’ rush and roulette
Another murdered verse, nigga where the candles at?
