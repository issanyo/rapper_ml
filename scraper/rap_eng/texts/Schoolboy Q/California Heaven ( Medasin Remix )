[Intro: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on

[Verse 1: JAHKOY]
Seems like all these girls are perfect
All these girls are perfect
In LA, in LA
They've got so much there to purchase
All those labels on their purses
In LA, in LA

[Chorus: JAHKOY]
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's California
Heaven's California

[Verse 2: ScHoolBoy Q]
Yao
Blank face, amazing grace
God damn girl, god god god damn girl
Use your angel wings, no hands girl
I'm the man from the land girl
Go ham in the lab
You know skrt skrt
Lift your skirt
That's missionary like church church
Legs open like pearly gates in a thug mansion
Get a thug passion
Without Alize
Bow down to pray
I burn an ounce a day
Puff puff pass
No rosaries like Catholics
Might cop the rolls, just to crash it
You could rock the rollie while I hit it
Hey you could rock the rollie while I hit it
Yeah ScHoolBoy in a new toy
With a new toy, a whole down fig
You was looking for heaven and you find it
You was looking for heaven and you find it

[Verse 1: JAHKOY]
No place I've seen compares to California
There's nothing but angels out there
A place filled with angels I swear
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's California
Heaven's California

[Verse 3: JAHKOY]
They say come and join us
The weathers much warmer
Heaven's California
Heaven's California
