[Verse]
I'm your Pusha Man
Time and time I heal again
Always down to lend a hand
Would you tell a friend?
I'm the one that keep the work
Just direct them to the fancy shirt
How you doing love? Ain't no limit pass the sky above
By far your cheapest trip, just a dub
Welcome to the game, promise you won't feel the same
4-1-1 they know my name
I'm your Pusha Man (eh)
Girl, I'm your Pusha Man
Girl, I'm your Pusha Man
Time and time I heal again
How you doing tell a friend?
I'm your Pusha Man
All the things that you adore
How you feeling tell me more?
I'm your Pusha Man
