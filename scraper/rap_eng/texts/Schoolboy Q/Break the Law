[Intro: Juicy J]
Get high, breaking laws
Get high, breaking laws

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is banging like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's the young miraculous, mister love-to-grab-his-nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with forty courses, bunch of horny whores and fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon, man
I bring this to you like lalalalala-live man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell them "shhh" this middle finger sign for silence
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keeping quiet

[Hook: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, I been riding through the city
Blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit
But now I walk around with money and my hand on my dick
I think I'm special
I'm drinking whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit I'm losing track now
Coming to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound,  turned that to a house
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here?
Spending all your time just getting high will drive you crazy
I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the 80's
Speeding down the freeway getting head in my Mercedes
Giving me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better
No pressure, dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola, have you ever been?
Shit I probably could've been the president

[Hook: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, riding through the city blowing smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol looking out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, I ain't ever been a bitch though
Rules to this game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Oh no, (br-br-br-break the law)
La, la, la

[Outro: Juicy J & Mac Miller]
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Get money, fuck the system, break the law
Break the law, br-br-br-break the law
Break the law
Break the law
Break the law
La la la la la la la la la
