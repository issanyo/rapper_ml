[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
I got bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody fully loaded better watch your step
You keep running your mouth, or I'm hiding where you slept
Bet you be hog-tied and die for fucking with a red
Do this for my niggas, bet they say it's worth it
So I don't leave the studio not until it's perfect
Can't you see I'm grinding, can't you see I'm working
Down to give this motherfuck the life and that's for certain
Sipping on that lean, same color as Easter
This weed Halloween, hi it's nice to meet ya
Checking out my steelo, it's on another
Couple hundred kilo, spend it with my brother

[Hook]
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
I got﻿ money in my wallet, money in my pocket
Burner in my hand, so you better watch it
Bitch, I am the man tryna make a profit
Hope you understand, nigga what's ya logic?
Sagging in my jeans because I'm gutta
Fresh as Listerine, and still I'm gutta
Bitch I'm bout my paper, I'm bout that butter
Roll me up a blunt, time for another
Everybody paper chasin', working on a situation
Giving bitches penetration, Houston rocking, got it popping
Niggas like to catch a fade ever seen a nigga drop
Coup the wrap, pollute the block
Cock it back then shoot the cop
Flee the scene then get the cream
Then go split it with my team
Live my life and live it right
Shit I'm the homie with a mic
The homies out here ain't nice
Earn they stripes, serving white
Shaving coke, nigga what you living for?

[Hook]
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga finally on another page
Glock forty or the gauge (fade)
Hit a nigga with a blade, lay down, blocka
Then go around, blocka
Then another, take cover, black zip covers
Pass the deacon speakin', say the briefing
I know I left that nigga leaking
I know I coulda let him slide
But shit I'd rather slide a nigga
Forty-five a nigga
Shots will dive inside a nigga
Clean and sanitize a nigga
Smooth operator, Under-layer
Fast forward them shots and those who play us
Got love for my haters
And garcia Vegas
I put a dub in that it keeps my mind free of mazes
See my rhymes still amazes
Amazing ass nigga here to lick and pass nigga
Scheme ass on blast nigga
You say you doing bad, nigga what you lying for
Better get your chopper and then turn this bitch to Rambo
Meanwhile

I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)

I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set
