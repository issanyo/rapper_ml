Part 1: "Prescription"

[Verse 1]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now depression creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box (Prescription drugs)

[Interlude: Joy]
What's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!

[Verse 2]
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some woods for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Wise night, but that's my life (Prescription drugs)

[Outro: Joy]
What's wrong? You tired? You mad? Okay, I love you, daddy

Part 2: "Oxymoron"

[Intro]
Uh, let me get some there for 20 dollars watch, 20 dollars
You can get one for 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 whatever nigga
Seattle what up? Bitch you gon' love me forever!

[Hook]
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron

[Verse 1]
Crazy, got my stash somewhere in her Mercedes
80's, get these off new shoes for my baby
Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi
What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta re-up 50 times just to get a rack off, ungh
I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only re-up'd one time
Where the sun barely shine and it rain for about
Nine months out the year, man it's something right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers, when I look up at y'all city like lookin' in the mirror
Damn near had a career, just might shed a tear, ungh
Man, this shit right here for my niggas who ain't make it home
Sitting on a tear, got a dap to a nigga bright in here, feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes, I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like clear, ungh
Big body cold like a Polar Bear, ungh
I done sold more shit than hookers, expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Vanity slave, got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same, even if I got life, I ain't saying a name

[Hook]
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron

[Verse 2]
Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Ooh wee, cops bringing dogs hope they donâ€™t sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50, you can get one for 30 if you let me hook this titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr. J
I prescribe you, I'm your doctor, kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroin
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit, so I don't listen
In fact "We living to die" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

[Hook]
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
(What you say? What you say?)
O-X-Y, I'm moron, O-X-Y, I'm moron
