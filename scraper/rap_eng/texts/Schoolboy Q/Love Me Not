Yo
Yo Yo
She love me
She love me not
She love me not

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
She love me, she love me not but God knows I fucking want her
She love me, she love me not, I swear my heart need her, don’t it
She’s playing with my emotions, she don't Know where I'm going
She don't know where I'm headed, with a sky, could look down on Heaven
More drive than transmissions, she was my ambition
She was my whole motive, the reason I’m still going
The reason I’m in the lab, spilling my fucking feelings
Telling you how I feel, you should see how I’m living
By the way, I’m fucking winning, yea hear me, I’m fucking winning
Versace vintage lenses, black and brown Fendi stitching
Baby I run the world, need someone to share it with
But your love was counterfeit, nigga had to get over it
And then I got over you
Could’ve been something special, but you didn’t want us too
And now you're calling, the thought of you, it makes me uncomfortable
Shit what I was s'posed to do?
Shit I’m moving on, a nigga had to put you in my song

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
She love me, she love me not
She love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me not
When she love me, I'm on the road
When I'm low, she back a ho
When she love me, I'm on the road
When I'm low, she back a ho

[Verse 2: TiRon]
She love me, she love me not, I swear that I fucking need it
Even my homies see that I have trouble *gasp* breathing
Maybe cause she taking my breath away, never play her, I wouldn’t
Got Hathaway out my apple playing whenever I look at her photo
Uh-Oh, here I go again
Pretending she more than the Mona Lisa, need to calm it down
And I know she piece,' cause damn I want a piece, at least a taste, shit
I’ll even tame the beast and paint poetry between the sheets
And no, we ain't together yet and maybe I'm jumping the gun
Uhummida hummida hummida
Momma you fine, and love what you could’ve been
But you ain't answer my number enough
And if anything I gave you chances, romance, but I never planned that
You played me and shit, I’m so glad I didn’t end up with you
And stuck with you, fucked up with you
And it sucks we can’t get comfortable in public when you drunk
Slurring ain't gone cut it
Shit what I’m supposed to do? I’m over you
Yea I’m moving on, that’s why I put you in this song

[Hook]
