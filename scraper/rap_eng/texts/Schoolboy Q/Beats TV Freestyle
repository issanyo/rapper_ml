[Verse 1]
Tell a nigga somethin' that he don't know
Tell a nigga somethin' that he don't know
See, I think a nigga found his fuckin' mojo
Get this bitch jumpin' like a pogo
Came to this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Two to be exact, grindin' ox packs
Tried to sell crack, but I couldn't get it off
Niggas came through, tried to knock a nigga off
Guess it's time to set it off
Two to the dome, make his fuckin' (?) soft
I really 'bout that shit
Mr. (?), I never made it to a brick
Thinkin' since five, never made it to a six
Momma's at work, I'm with the homies hittin' liqs
Yeah, want to be a baller, be a shot-caller, then she a hauler
The titty is mine, so titties and ass, she know how I grind
Started with one, then ended with nine
Grew up with churches, we'd practise the Quran
Uh, fuckin' with Dickies, now Louis Vuitton
Uh, then tell her it's your gangsta, now picture my mom
Uh, yeah, my motherfuckin' locs
Somebody tell my momma her son sell dope
