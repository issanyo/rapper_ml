[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Who you tellin'?
Blank faces

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Smokers and dope fiends, hookers and playas
Dope in the vein, young'ns servin' the meds
Run from the police, jump from the ledge
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right
Niggas don’t understand until you leap over 25
Dancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right
Feet on the pedal runnin' over jokers and funny tops
Word to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes
I should know better, heaven knows that I ain’t the dummy type, nah
I should be flyin' home without a care
My baby don’t want no toys, she want me there
I trade the noise for a piece of divine
I savor my coins for a piece of the land
Something to pass while I'm passin' my prime
My word in the cards, full deck in my hand
As sure as the smog is pollutin' the land
Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Wise as my Chevy
My life’s so fucked up the drank don’t get me buzzed
We ain’t blood and they killed my cous'
Chuckin' Cs since I was a cub
Young nigga grew up on hate but where’s the love?
Ash and dubs on

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Niggas don’t understand until you leap over 25
Dancin' with devils
Guess you would say I'm one of the lucky type
No—fuck you thought?

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Playin' tooth fairy, Santa before I’m buried
Easter egg huntin', pickin' seeds out the pumpkin
Six years straight the valentine for my munchkin
I made a queen outta nothin'
Told me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage
Said a million wasn’t realistic
Last year I spent it, what’s the laws of physics?
Move pounds or move down to Section 8 livin'
Grew up around Crippin', woo business

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
And if I never make it to 25 I swear to God I’m still gon' fly, nigga
But it’s still my time, nigga
Tell me who gon' fly with me?
Yeah!
Who gon' ride with ya?
Who gon' fly with ya?
It’s still my time, yeah
It’s still my time, nigga, yeah
