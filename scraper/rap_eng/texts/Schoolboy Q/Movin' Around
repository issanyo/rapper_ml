[Intro: CyHi the Prynce]
What you need, nigga?
Alright, I'm on the way, yeah
Boy I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
I need 17 for the split, I need 32 for the pound
Boy I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
Shit I know who get the money, ain't like I'm new to the town

[Hook: CyHi the Prynce]
So I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
I need 17 for the split, I need 32 for the pound
Boy I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
Shit I know who get the money, ain't like I'm new to the town

[Verse 1: CyHi the Prynce]
Boy I'm back moving around
Just got a pack, Iâ€™m bout through with it now
Yesterday I sold my partner a cutie
Fuck it, I might just come through with a ounce
He gimme the check, I run through it then bounce
Drove off in a Buick as true as it sounds
CyHi pull up in the trap with them bags
Keep somethin' on me to shoot at a clown
Folk, I'm back moving around
They say I needed a buzz in the street
I said "Damn, y'all shoulda told me!
Since I was 15, I been plugged with the tree
Before y'all knew 'bout Meech, I was up in the D
Somewhere on Fenkell with drugs in the Jeep
You don't know how it feel when your cousin a Blood
And you can't call him cousin 'cause bousin a G
Your homies is Crips and you stuck in between
Either you rob or you fuck with them ki's"
I told my label to sign my release
I'll go back to the block, it ain't nothing to me

[Hook: CyHi the Prynce]
So I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
I need 17 for the split, I need 32 for the pound
Boy I'm back movin' around, Boy I'm back movin' around
Shit I know who get the money, ain't like I'm new to the town

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Taking my chance on the road
Told my daughter that I love but I go
Rather go provide then be there and broke
Life or death, the paper bringing us hope
Know these haters want me dead in the dirt
Know they hate when every day is the first
Wore it once, about a thousand a shirt
Figure out which car I pick it and skrrt
Cross me once, they have to view you in church
Niggas tough until that hot one insert
Still got that dope in my sock
Gotta go watch for the cops
Keep it Top Dawg when I flee
Started with one-quarter piece, now we half-million a week
Kick down the door like a Jeep
'Bout 20 years since I sleeped, I brought belief to the Priest
I can sell sand to the beach
Been through the fire, I'ma raise Hell to the Gods
Oddly I multiply dimes
Small with a circle of mines, I'm

[Hook: CyHi the Prynce]
So I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
I need 17 for the split, I need 32 for the pound
Boy I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
Shit I know who get the money, ain't like I'm new to the town

[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
Lemme tell you 'bout the one time I had a rental
With a half a bag of that Sacramento
Seen cop's lights flash, threw it out the window
Right there cross the street from Allen Temple
Shit that was my MO 'fore I had a demo
And I had a Pinto but it had the tint though
Then I had a Benzo now I got a limo
Shit, I always knew a nigga had potential
Blow a bag of indo like a bad Nintendo
If I had your bimbo, it was accidental
Now I'm actin nimble cause she actin' simple
Back to running circles round the A like an "at" symbol
Hah, Hamilton Holmes to Indian Creek
I pray I'm at home when my enemies creep
So many shots, it sound like it's 20 of me
My boy rock a robin like twee-lee-lee-lee
I email my bitches, I CC CeCe
I told her to meet me at BB&T
Only see me in Georgia, I'm GPTV

[Hook: CyHi the Prynce]
So I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
I need 17 for the split, I need 32 for the pound
Boy I'm back movin' around, boy I'm back movin' around
Shit I know who get the money, ain't like I'm new to the town

[Outro]
Better have all my cash when I pull up on you niggas
Be-better have all my cash when I pull up on you
Be-be-better have all my cash, cash, pull up on, pull up on you
Have, have cash, cash, pull up ni-niggas
