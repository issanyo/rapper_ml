[Part 1: Run]

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
Breathing Chronic in my system
Watching your body hypnotize me from your rhythm
Put that thing up in my kitchen
See your body type's to carry on tradition
You and jeans open doors, key, keys to a Porsche

[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
Shawty get a buzz
Shawty get a buzz from ending relationships
Shawty sexing flesh, hips, thighs and her breasts made to get ya
She bad enough to make you write her number on the back of your girlfriend's picture

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got a walk like she stalking prey
Them killer curves and that pretty face
And she gon' make you do what she say
Licking them lips, swinging them hips as she walk your way

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
You better run, run for your life
You better run, run for your life

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
Shawty get a thrill
Shawty get a thrill from making a nigga beg
Set 'em up, turn 'em out, knock 'em down, it's just that simple
Shawty make love like a drug or a shotgun straight to the temple

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
She got a walk like she stalking prey
Them killer curves and that pretty face
And she gon' make you do just what she says
Licking them lips, swinging them hips as she come your way

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
You better run, run for your life
Oh oh you better run, run for your life oooh

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Hips movin', yo ass pokin', young neck breaker
Dress stretching, eyes sparkling, you a breath taker
Heart stopper, need a chart topper
Groovy Q meets Big Pimpin'
St. Laurent for your Spring clothes
Red bottoms, you need those
All the things I do for you, oh
Got a private jet for two, oh
Yeah, we taking off or we can land in Rome
Pull away without the roof
All these things I do for you
How these bras come out the blue
God built you like a temple
How your body drive me schizo

[Chorus]
You better run, run for your life
You better run, run for your life oh oh

[Spoken Outro]
Drowning in a sea of groupies, buckets and scallywags. Clinging to sanity by a thread, suffocating
When suddenly he spots her
Sexy and classy attire, very little makeup
Weave on point, buying her own damn drinks
And as the thot waves keep crashing
And attempt to bring my man down, behold sweet salvation
An island, Integrity Jones
