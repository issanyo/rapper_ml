Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
I be zoned out, getting mine
What I'm worried bout shit is fine
Its a few things that I like, Beats Hoes and some Rhymes
In the two door through the night
I be zoned out living life

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I'm mixin' apple juice and XO
That's the type of shit we be drinking on the West Coast
I stay open when the rest closed
I got the most game never said I had the best flows
Uh a real nigga and yo ex know
Mad you can't go everywhere that us vets go
When you see me out you just gotta pay respect though
From Benz, truck, coupes, lex-o's
I like shrimp in my pesto, ya girl kinda ugly but she got a nice chest tho
I'm so disrespectual, I'm not no fucking intellectual
I'm trying to get this money so I can get me a boat
And stay away from niggas that be dirty and broke
Cause a nigga like me won't be 30 and broke
And you gone lose your life if you think its a joke
Let that simmer down for you, im not nobody thats gone clown for you
I'mma make em put a mound on you, nigga I be all around town on you

[Verse 2:Casey Veggies]
Dark shades in the party, ain't worried about nobody
Man that girl know she got it, I might get her nigga watch me
And I ain't just gone pull her, ima make that girl love me
But this world full of darkness im just trynna stay above it
I just need some inspiration, maybe some ventilation
Maybe I should stop racin' the hardest shit that im chasin'
Take it slow, slow and you use to letting it go
One thing that I learn is just a bunch of shit I dont know
I'm riding round town and I made a left at the store
Ran into a girl I know, got her new number fasho I said fasho, so
She heard a few of my songs and after that I proceed to run through a few of her thongs
I keep mental philosophies that I learned even at my home
Now I'm gone for the scrilla, mom on the phone let her know that i'll be home in December
Since I can remember I was on the grind so our home wouldn't be so cold in the winter
Till I get a whip with a chick with a grip and zip I can flip and a home I can lend her

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
SHit, sHit, all I can do is me
Few coronas or blue moons and bet I got some weed
Top Dawg fuck a bitcH scratcH my balls and flee
Eat pills, now fufill your drills be all tHat you can be
Aw, place tHis product in ya bra stasH, smasH
Fuck tHe police as tHe ligHts flasH, crasH
Got away but sHit it caugHt tHe dasH
Turtle necks and long sleeves because my body tagged
So back to tHe beats cause I fucked up my lease
RHymes increase release to tHe streets Heat How you need
A gangsta tHats sippin pink, need to see a sHrink
Going insane I'm crazy, going HAM in tHat pussy Miss Piggy
Dont eat it tHougH Veggies, tHe cycle goes around a regulary, wait
Slide in tHe patH a nigga don't pHase me
Dos cuatro siete I keep my nueve
