[Verse 1]
Gunpowder on my fingertips
Cocaine between my fingernails
Look, mama, what Schoolboy brought to Show & Tell
Ain't got no vest, protected by these shells
Kill or be killed, lift up souls, we raising Hell
Ungh - two for his back bring failure to his lungs
YAWK-YAWK-knock-knock your bell been rung
Might burn your heart, this pistol'll fill your tum'
Ungh... ungh... dope dealer, dope nigga
Got the stash in the rental takin' blunts to the mental
Fuck y'all, go get 'em - bang 'em all
Ball and ball, money tall, Pau Gasol, want it all
I want that crib and I want that yard
I want that broad and I want that car
I'll pull your card for frontin' like you hard
You be in deep shit from this pistol...
His heart racing, my heart's not
Shift his top, hold that thought
Wave my flag, bitch stop
You forgot, I hit 'em up... yeah

[Hook]
Ungh... boy, I hit 'em up...
Ungh, motherfucker, I hit 'em up...
Ungh... I say, nigga, I hit 'em up..

[Verse 2]
They come to me to learn shit they can't learn in church
Like get him 'fore he get you first
Jump out with J-O-B, 'bout to put in work (work... yeah)
Have a seat, this bullet pierce your shirt
Ain't nothing sweet, you'll see a star burst
I keep orange laces in my Converse
Off house arrest, now hear this converse
I draw my pistol on my hip, you see that rubber grip
Don't have a half a clue, them boxes for hollow tips
I've got more Oxy than a pharmacy
Also, I keep action clips, when I move E
Yeah, I swear to God won't find a nigga like him
I greet 'em, pop 'em, then I As-salamu alaykum 'em
Heaven or Hell your only ultimatum
Hit a pussy for his lip ring, my niggas murder
No attempting - got blasted
'Nother dropped on his ass, placed up in that body bag
Toe tag, I hit 'em up!

[Hook]
