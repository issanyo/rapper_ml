[Verse 1: MOD SUN]
H – I – double P – Y
You can probably see why
Buzzin like a beehive
Never on the rewind
Ahead, never behind
Flow deeper
Than knee-high
Caught up in moment
And I think that I might be why
I feel the seconds
Goin slower
No traffic on the drive
If you ridin on the shoulder
Watch the times get warmer
And my rhymes get colder
With the wisdom I supply
They stay surprised I’m not older
And I can’t blame them for that
No I can’t blame them for that
I interact with the art thats viewed as abstract
I’m an artist meant to impact
When I’m gone my notebook
Becomes an artifact
And I live on through every track
So I take it to the max
Never relax
Passed the point of detacched
All I see is where I know i’m bout to be at
I'mma light up in this room regardless
I'mma pick from the best of the harvest
I'mma float around a joint til we hit the next point
So if anyone asks, “I’m marvelous.”
I’ve been liberated from the negative
Made a new way out of the way it is
Moved straight out my momma’s basement
To a nice placement
In a set of quotations
I sleep so rarely I barely know
What day it is today
I’m bout tomorrow
No one blockin my lane like i’m shootin free throws
Goin over they’re head like i’m kickin field goals
No problems only got solutions
Remind the old to stay young i’m just fountain of youth’n
Use-in everything received to deliver
To become a sea that refuses no river

[Hook]
Got the weed on deck
New Hippys(x4)
I'mma tye dye everything
From the north to the south let the people know what we bout. Tye dye everything
From the west to the east everybody get up off they’re fett. Tye dye everything
Got the remedy, got this place lookin like the 70′s
Imaa tye dye everything

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Got the weed on deck
Get the hoes on the line
Let 'em know it’s 'bout that time
Need to put it way up where the sun don’t shine
You can have her after, I don’t want the bitch
Ho I’m a star, you ain't notice this?
Bras on the front of the sofa-sis
East direction like compass is
Hennessy shots or crack a brew (Q)
Blowin on skunk nigga Peppy Le Pew (Q)
G nigga bro what kinda nigga is you
You always actin like you rappin, I don’t never pursue
Uh, call that doo doo
Boo Boo and your bars straight shit too
Wait, Uh, Look look
That’s a bar by the way
And yes you can meet me by the bar by the way
One of everything, Mr Chardonnay
Then throw a party in her pussy, ok?
Weeds just the weed, coffee cake
Wake and bake, fuck that shake
Afgani, Sour D
Half a P, OMG
Get high and dress nice, fly I be (Q)
Mod Sun nigga lets burn it down
Then bust a bitch just look around
Then throw the bitch in the lost and found
With no panties just ass and gown
Uh, groovy style
No Black & Mild, just weed and brews
Weed and brews movie shoes
Just the two
That’s the peace
Black Hippy
Peace
