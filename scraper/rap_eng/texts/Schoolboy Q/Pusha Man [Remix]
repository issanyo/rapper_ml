[Vizzy Val]
Shit, you're like the rehearsal before I have kids
Type of ho niggas would hustle just to get a kiss
Fuck around? I ain't got no time like a bracelet
Bitch sit down, but only if my face let
Who am I? Vizzy Val
The realest dogg with a lot bitches, but I never chase 'em
I got a bad habit, matter of fact they're a lot
One of 'em is to steal the show, call the cops
Before is none left, the good dies young so my hoes bad
Back to you baby girl, you got class
No caps lock on but you got a big ass
You're mine and I'm yours for the night, Viz your Pusha Man

[ScHoolboy Q]
I'm your pusha man, time and time I heal again
Always down to lend a hand
Would you tell a friend?
That I'm the one that keep that work
Just direct them to the fancy shirt
How you doing love?
Ain't no limit, pass the sky above
By far your cheapest trip just a dub
Welcome to the game, promise you won't feel the same
4-1-1 they know my name
I'm your pusha man
Girl, I'm your pusha man
Girl, I'm your pusha man
Time and time I heal again
How you doing, tell a friend
I'm your pusha man
All the things that you adore
How you feeling tell me more
I'm your Pusha Man
