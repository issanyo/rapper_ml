What it is, Young Sam

[Chorus: Traffic]
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old school
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like, y'all
Bitch, I'm classic, yeah classic
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old days
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like you new niggas
Classic, nah, classic, yeah!

[Verse 1: Traffic]
I'm first up (it's me, nigga), on the M-I-C
Bitch its Traffic, everything I spit be classic
Somethin' like coke, I need to post up by the store
Woke, early in the mornin', late nights until its gone
Just a little nigga bad as fuck, I was on
Pops wasn't there, moms was rarely home
'Cause she was too busy workin', had ten kids at home
[?]
While moms workin', I was in the streets gone
Thinkin' I was grown
Started gang-bangin', gang signs with the chrome
Fresh out the pen and now I'm known around the globe
Fuckin' all the bitches and I'm killin' all the shows
Just in case you didn't know, I'm the nigga with the flow
Call me Bruce LeRoy, nigga I got the glow
[?]
Still will serve a nigga when a nigga gettin' low
Knock, knock, guaranteed to [?] your pizza at your door

[Chorus: Traffic]
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old school
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like, y'all
Bitch, I'm classic, yeah classic
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old days
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like you new niggas
Classic, nah, classic, yeah!

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
From being a square to squarin' you pears
You fruit cakes scared to face-to-face
Number to erase, groovy-ass [?]
Pull my hammer out from under, watch it st-, st- studder
The ace baby, [?]
At 52nd, ain't learn nothin' at John Muir hustlin'
A real nigga, snatch Hilfiger, the flirts remember
Get blindsided, we all violence, nigga
Traffic said his pop wasn't home but at least you knew him
Remember when he stole my bike, well I shoulda [?] him
But rest in peace to Big [?], he was a legend
Taught us what to be and not to be, it was a blessin'
My single mother worked too hard to break the agreements up
So I keep my chucks in the set and my head in Venus, ugh
Posted on the block every day but I kept dreamin', ugh
Took my homies out the State to Europe to see it, ugh
Day ones, same niggas, same figures, ugh
Car, got it, robotic, two-seaters, ugh
I know this where the hook s'posed to be but this shit is easy
Gang tats i know the cops hate that i became a baller, ugh
Moses split the sea while I moonwalked over water, ugh
Cross me once and I'm back like Jesus, my god
Niggas go from talkin' a storm to layin' stiff, ugh
Wrapped you up but somehow I'm the gift?
What? Nigga, classic

[Chorus: Traffic]
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old school
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like, ya'll
Bitch, I'm classic, yeah classic
Ain't nothing like the old shit
Ain't nothing like the old days
I ain't nothing like this new shit
I ain't nothing like you new niggas
Classic, nah, classic, yeah!
