[Intro]
Figg Side!

[Verse 1]
(Ball so hard) What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me
Can you please remind me?
Shit, I'll remind ya
Put that steel behind ya, put five inside ya
Better chill out with all that flossing partner
(Ball so hard) You must be cray
Leave 'em in the streets
With his shoelaces missing and socks up off his feet
Pistol holding gonorrhea, nigga, skeet-skeet
Soul dropped, Rock dropped, Dot dropped
Black Hippy, TDE, well, fuck it, nigga, let's four-peat
A dope Hoover dealer, uh, ADHD
Fuck that, let's bake coke and cook crack
Fuck the sheriffs, the gang unit, fuck C.R.A.S.H
Pimp hoes or wring ya bread, she love tracks
Crack of dawn, Figg get it, yeah we get it, yeah
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year
Niggas better hope our star popping
Before I start robbing the re-up with Oxycontin

[Hook]
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
(Ball so hard) You must be cray

[Verse 2]
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like you
You still need a reminder? (Yeah, I thought so)
Shit, I'm loco, 38 brown had to call him coco
Stick around the block boy, tell 'em go go
Don't stop shooting 'til ya all red tho
Yellow tape mothafucka shoulda yield ho
Why you all tough for? See your thug ass later at the crossroads
The landlord turn your lieutenant into a tenant
And if ya, rims spinning, your jaw dented
I'm a grown man dog, I ain't kidding
The end has come, so keep big weed and big lungs, big guns
Brought on her knees, the holy ghost, she speak in tongues
Murder searching, why even run one shot, he done
Nigga you must got me confused
Bitch, I'm from the Groove on Figg Side making moves
Drive to pussy more than I do to church
No AC, but the heater work, MURK!

[Hook]
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
It's storming, it's snowing, it's flooding, we still out here thugging
On Figg, we see it, we need it, we want it, we get it
Figg get the money, yeah, all season, every year
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
Figg get it, get it, Figg get it, get it, get it, yeah
(Ball so hard) You must be cray
