[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
I count 6 shots
Reload
Line 'em all up again
We gon take 6 more

[Verse 1: Watch The Duck]
Make sure you hydrated
I hope that you didn't think we ain't bullshittin', we ain't playin'
Everybody standing up now pretty soon be layin'
Throw it up
See how cool you are wit your friend
When you lose your shoe and [?]
When she hold your hair back and let you lay down and laugh at you tomorrow
When she post that shit on Instagram
Well let's find out if she really give a damn

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
I count 6 shots
Reload
Line 'em all up again
And we gon take 6 more

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q & Watch The Duck]
Uh
All on your phone while I'm standing right here
You don't who I am
Bring you and your friend
Bar about to go up
Every girl here, fuck
I count 6 shots
151 with the fire on top
You got a man at home, but you in here now, and you know you wrong
But your booty showing
Aye
Can I rock wit you?
Can I groove wit you?
Is this your favorite song?
Aye
Or we could have relations
No conversations
But Avi√≥n
Aye
Line 'em up
I'm try'na hang wit you tonight
Seen the whole globe
For now the drink hold me down wit your clothes

[Chorus: Watch The Duck]
I count 6 shots
Reload
Line 'em all up again
And we gon take 6 more, oh

[Post-Chorus: Watch The Duck & Schoolboy Q]
We gon take 6 more
Shots, shots
We gon take 6 more
Shots, shots
Shots, shots
We gon take 6 more
We gon take 6 more
Shots
(Shots shots shots shots)
And we gon take 6 more
And we gon take 6 more

[Verse 3: Watch The Duck, (Candice Pillay), Schoolboy Q]
Let's see how far you willing to go, my baby
And getting loose out on the floor, my baby
And your folks in here losin' they mind
Puttin' out money and you turned out fine
You ain't got on no cuffs cause you ain't mine, no
Aye
(Imma do what I want oh)
Aye
You got a man at home, but you in here now, and you know you wrong
Aye
(Gonna do what I want oh)
Aye

Can I groove wit you?
Is this your favorite song?

[Outro: Candice Pillay & (Watch The Duck)]
I never been this drunk before
I never wanted someone more than I do you-ou-ou right now, now
(And we gon take six more)
Too many people in this room-o-oom
When I'd rather it just be me and you-ou-ou
And we can take six more
And we can take six more
(And we gon take six more)
