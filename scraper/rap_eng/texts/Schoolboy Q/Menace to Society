[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Dreaming to be a menace, me and my two brothers
With three mothers, but no fathers and no bitches so fuck it
Shoemaking '96, make the best of it
Licking on the thumbs, wipe my shoe, because I just scuffed it
Just another day, another gat buzzin'
Lying up in first grade, like we all fucking
You want to fight? We all fight! See, we all rushing
Streetlights is home, when I'm home mom is [?]fuzzin
Waking up for the proper time to sneak, jump out at the window
Now we back up in the streets
Who got the weed?
Who got the liqour?
Who got the flow?
Who about to rip ya?
Spit my lyrical shit, now we back up on the bitch
Said we're dreaming that we're stars, while we point at different cars
Wishing that we rich, but sooner or later reality hits
Sooner or later our memory switch
Different gats and different clips
Steady relaxing on the strips
Thinking life is just a bitch

[Verse 2: Punch]
Post traumatic, cocaine repulsive habits
Ravish the black masses on the Reagan era
The reign of terror the masses, the birth of a nation
Free basing, babies craving a vaccination in this world
And it's desires slowly passing through the fire
When I wish to do right, what is wrong got expired
Know i'm preachin' to the choir lost in this quagmire
Sitting on fools gold, 24" inch, I ball wise
[?]
And honestly, the truth will set you free
And yall all liars
I'm giving them food for thought, since they say they ain't eating
Complaining about hunger pains, in reality they teething
They ain't ready for the other side, they're overworking
Transmission, slow down to check the mileage
The road to riches stay crowded, fake smiling
Violence in the mist of it all, remain consciousness

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Yo, sitting up, locked in my room, writing my thoughts
Trying to get it across, but half of my niggas is lost
It's like, niggas rather claim a set, than earn a check so fuck it
Hit the burner aim it high up at your neck and bust it
Whoa it's that easy, that's how you rock it
Damn, that's how you chop it
Come on, let's get it popping
Over these guitars, see me spitting my scarves
See, it really gets hard with a felony charge
They send a nigga to jail, it was like living in hell
With that "F" on your record, yo, you're destined to fail
Niggas try to get a job, they figure you rob
So it's back to the street life, living it odd
Your funds go up, that's when a nigga head blow up
Until you floss around a wrong nigga, hair growned up
It's kinda strange, when I started, I was already finished
Adapted to my enviroment, born to be a menace
