(Never 3x)

[Verse 1]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
Iâ€™m latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Bridge]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Verse 2]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest?

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Prop-proper
Come on, I gotcha
Have you ever seen a new helicopter?
Straight off the blocka
This little Nicki grew up to be monster
You deserve to be mama
Twinkle twinkle, her sparkle'll blind ya
You and me is a must, girl
You shy like the first day of school
Got me some weed if you cool on the booze
Lie on the couch while I drool on your boobs
Naw, I'm just kiddin', just kiddin' to you
Take you to heaven, pit stop at the moon
Stuntin' July til the month after June
Hang on my arm while we freeze up the room
Girl, you the bomb won't you take it and boom, boom

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I'm latching on to you
I won't let go of you
I won't let go, I won't let go
I won't let go, I won't let go
