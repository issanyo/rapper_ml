[Intro]
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to the future
Sit back, relax while I seduce you
Just jump with them shooters
Switch this, maneuver's get gooder, 'bout the paper
Not varied to 'bout no motherfuckin' hitter
Bitches, bumbaclots, I run with Glocks
Hit the drip, it's in your shots
Pick the biggest nigga out the room and knock him out his socks
Word to mother, you's a sucker like that...

[Outro]
Quincy, get up
It's after seven o'clock and you gonna be late for school again
Did you hear me? I said get up
This some bullshit, man
Excuse me, young man, what did you say?
Nothin', ma
That's what I thought
