[Verse 1]
Every time that I wake up I swear I'm never down
Even when I'm in my dreams I'm high off self-esteem
Blowing on that Jamaica my niggas not a team
Marijuana fiend
Keep your black & mild's and cigs cause me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Moosa as we pulled up on them sixes
Just to go and bust some bitches
See the motherfuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with them tints
That Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel
Like the orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a xanny or a klonopin
All your swishas they be model thin
We plus sized nigga
Like Tocarra and them
Shining like a halogen
Soul bright like high beams, headlights at midnight
Like one of Rhode Island's watch tower sights (Yeah)
The world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Hook]
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything
Know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money man
But bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed
Who, who got some weed
Who, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed
Uh, who got some weed

[Verse 2]
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a Corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees then let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour dies'
Make a order, it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it til we on E
Then we fill up again with another ten
Then we just go run back to the chiefs for filler
Family needs, no worries
Smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of three's
We dying up in every plea
So for y'all my niggas, swear to God my heart'll bleed
Kick this shit for my lifers and ones who get ?
Even if it's just five dollars just keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind, cause in due time you'll wine and dine
Somethin' fine, and that kush blunt soon be your valentine
And my shit be Columbine
My friends is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Hook]
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
You don't know anything
Know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
Ain't got no money man
But bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed
Who her? She got some weed
Who him? He got some weed
My Aunt, She got some weed
My Unc, He got some weed
My Moms, she got some weed
My home, got some weed
My homie...
