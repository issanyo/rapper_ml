[Chorus]
We can talk about money, power
We can talk about clothes
We can talk about mackin' bitches
We can talk about flows
Who can fuck wit it?
Who can fuck wit it?

[Verse 1]
We can talk about money, power
We can talk about gats
We can talk about slangin' dope for hours
Man let's talk about that
Who can fuck wit it?
Jump out the curb and I had to blast
Eight-ball in the corner of a grocery bag
Cocaine, white bitch, with a [?] ass
Said she got the fake titties for a real nigga
That's why I'm still witcha
Told her "Baby girl, I just wanna build witcha"
I'm rich but I still deal witcha
So fresh, so clean, take a [?] picture
Took a couple pills and it made me sicker
Blunt after blunt 'til I can't remember
Made a four-course meal and it ain't November
Rap like Jesus, boy and it ain't December
[?] side, Hoover Street gang member
Short, fat nigga with a short temper
Telescope [?]
Give that fuck boy a temper
Snipe his pimple, red dot, red dot, makes it simple
No love shown, I ain't sentimental
Man I write right to the instrumental
Bad little bitch in the driver seat
Her range, no tint, high as me
Still haven't met a nigga get high as we
Natural leaf, with an ounce of tree
Smoke that real with a half of [?]
Sour dies, this OG, get so high we don't need feet
[?] so hard we don't need [?]

[Chorus]
We can talk about money, power
We can talk about clothes
We can talk about mackin' bitches
We can talk about flows
Who can fuck wit it?
Who can fuck wit it?

[Verse 2]
Baby girl (hum) girl on my dick huh
All cause a little shit that I kick huh
She know a nigga real, y'all [?]
Got a [?] just pick one
[?]
Rubber on, balls deep when I skeet, skeet
Two tits, my dick, that's 3D
Had a little nurse chick, drove a CC
She [?]
Ms. Sanchez, ScHoolboy [?] on campus
I should major in giving hoes the business
Them [?] in the Fendi
Who fuck wit it? (uhh)
Racket out, tennis game
Gon' fuck around and see me with Serena mane
My mind on Venus, and her mind on penis
Nigga, and I mean this
Flow be the meanest
Flow be the cleanest
Flow be the purist
Flow so wavy
Niggas try to catch the currents
[?]
I'm burning, bitch why is you staring?
Prolly cause [?]

[Chorus]
We can talk about money, power
We can talk about clothes
We can talk about mackin' bitches
We can talk about flows
Who can fuck wit it?
Who can fuck wit it?

[Outro]
I say hands in the air for a millionaire
Hands in the air for a millionaire
Whatcha talkin' man?
Only hit it one time, don't call her man
