[Hook]
Blank Face, tre 8, kill everybody, fuck an AK
Sell narcotics and step my dollars up to Bill Gates
Push all limits, you lookin' timid, need to back off
Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our black off
Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, ugh
Groovy Tony, no face killer, I see the money right, ugh

[Verse]
Blank Face, clear everything out the safe
Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too
My heart an igloo, the devil in all blue, huh
Die now go to heaven or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you
And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey
Hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hellbound, boogie down
Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat
Contradicting, now you peace
Leave you triple six laying in defeat
Can you dig it?
Struck a match, they won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezing fingertips, aye

Yeah, I'm (Blank Face)
