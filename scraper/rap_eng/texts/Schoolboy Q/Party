[Verse 1]
Yeah, hot LA nigga but I'm extra cold
No chain on and I'm extra froze
Lookin' icy, bucket hat P-O-LO
I smoke dope, everybody and my PO know
UFO, nigga, so damn fly
Backwood, that good, nigga, so damn high
I'm the truth, in the booth, why would I lie
Style out of this world, S-C-I Fi
Killin' these niggas, no CSI
Audi S5 throw that bitch in drive
Got a nine in the ride, 12 kids inside
Nigga knock knock, you should be advised
Bitch out comas, Versace on her
How ironic how this Rolie is a Daytona
Got a new bitch, come from Barcelona
Everybody love Q, better ask ya momma, yeah

[Hook]
Shit, I never know, when they might take my life
So I party all year, party all month, party all week, all night, all right
Dominican, Armenian, Cuban, got hoes all type
Party all year, party all month, party all week, all night, all right
(I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock)
Got hoes all tight
(I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock, I wanna rock)
Party all year, party all month, party all week, all night, all right
Japanese and Chinese, Lebanese got hoes all type
Party all year, party all month, party all week, all night, all right

[Bridge]
I'm a fuckin' G, let me see
He don't do it like me, he ain't groovy like me
Bet he broke, he ain't ballin' like me
80 racks, spend it all like me, double back like me
He ain't real, where they at like me? Show your hands
Where you're really like me, worth a milli like me
Shit I'm on, he ain't quite like me
You can never find a nigga like me, ahh

[Verse 2]
Nigga thinkin back when I was on Figg Row
Always had to reload, slidin' in the Regal
No L's in the whip, riding 'round illegal
Headed to the studio where you were stealin me flow
Now a nigga lookin' like a walkin' kilo
Probably in a Benzo, daughter in a pea coat
With your girl, on my sack, she deserve a Ho Ho
Headed to the studio, you're still stealin' me flow
Ride with Cavale in BR clothes
With a couple Loc's, real GI-Joes
Don't hug or kiss bitches but got X and O's
Fendi shades on, now they like "there he go"
Easy going, she a freak bro
Livin' my life, nigga, ain't simple
Tryna buy a pound, nigga what it hit for?
Smoke solo, all to the temple
Groovy Q, might get in acting too
Smokin' Kill Bill prolly fuckin' Lucy Liu
Puff Daddy ain't no tellin' what he might do
Niggas can't fade me, I ain't Boosie boo
Black Hippy, HiiiPower, the amazing group
Everybody be a star, like a fuckin' Jew
Cuban bitch, that's fine, never 69'd
Switch her to 64, she gettin' low low, yeah
