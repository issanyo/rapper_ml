[Hook: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town, say wassup
Roll around, say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup, that’s wassup
Break it down, that’s wassup
Blow a pound, that’s wassup, aye
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) (That’s wassup)
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) That's wassup
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
And my taillight broke like a promise, homie
This the realest shit I wrote, on my momma, homie
My teachers used to call my momma on me
Now I'm a rapstar and I could fuck my momma’s homies
(Soul!) Me and ScHoolboy hit the liquor store
Chocolate Swisher burn slow, how sweet?
Who got the dro? Who tryna chief?
Like Pocahontas' daddy
And I'm off that granddaddy kush, I'm finna start a family

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm ghetto, my Kool-Aid need mo' sugar
Five-star suite, you ain't know, suga? (You ain't know, bitch?)
I’m chilling, bumping Anita Baker
Caked up, they wonder why I don’t need a baker
But really though, I just need a hater
So I ask 'em for their number when I see a hater
Ask Obama if I don’t know about presidents
Keep them dead motherfuckers resting in my money clip

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town, say wassup
Roll around, say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup, that’s wassup
Break it down, that’s wassup
Blow a pound, that’s wassup, aye
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) (That’s wassup)
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) That's wassup
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me, what it do?
Cap'n Crunch and Top Ramen all a nigga ever knew
Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar, too
Who that nigga standing over there? That’s that nigga, Q
What it do? That's wassup, bang this in your Tonka truck
Everybody rocking Chucks and pistol packing, that’s a must
Sagging and my ass showing, mami and the cops knowing
All I wanna do is smoke a blunt, let it bump

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Yeah, I'm looking in the mirror and the nigga said, wassup, Rock?
And that nigga looked back at me and said, boy, you certified
Took my '87 Regal, put it in a chop shop
Stash spot, .45, run up, you gonna die
Looking for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back
Nigga diss me, no, I ain't missing, I'm throwing shots back
Jay Rock, top cat, and I'm still a Top Dawg
Boxed in that Porsche box like I'm fighting southpaw

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town, say wassup
Roll around, say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup
That’s wassup
Break it down, that’s wassup
Blow a pound, that’s wassup, aye
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) (That’s wassup)
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) That's wassup
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup

[Ab-Soul:]
I'm Soulo, take a photo, blowing do-do in a dojo

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We a green light, you a no-go, hey Q, go

[Schoolboy Q:]
No, Rock, go

[Jay Rock:]
I'm a rock though, like Barack though
And my eyes low and I drive slow like Paul Wall

[Schoolboy Q:]
Give it back though, I got y'all

[Ab-Soul:]
Nah, fuck that, I'm a ball hog

[Kendrick Lamar:]
No, fuck that, they gon' fall off

[Schoolboy Q:]
Got a sawed-off, I'mma hop out, let it all off
Hop back in, then I haul off

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We situated, we hit the pavement so hard
We all got ground to play with

[Ab-Soul:]
A challenger is like last year calendars

[Jay Rock:]
Yup, you're all outdated

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We all amazing, you all can hate it
You can live or die, that’s your ultimatum
Married to the game, at the altar wasted
A pound of white rice on the tribe of Asians

[Schoolboy Q:]
Niggas, they'll ride for me, bitches, they desire me
And what's the one thing they hate the most?

[Jay Rock:]
Saying bye to me

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup
When you see me in your town, say wassup
Roll around, say wassup
Even ones who wear the crown say wassup
That’s wassup
Break it down, that’s wassup
Blow a pound, that’s wassup, aye
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) (That’s wassup)
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup
(All day, every day, I be on my J-O) That's wassup
(Oh, all day, every day) That’s wassup
