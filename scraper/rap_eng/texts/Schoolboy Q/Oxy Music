[Hook]
I got my hustle, dog
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop, knock him off

[Verse 1]
Blood on the wall, death in the air
Birds on the ground, pistols everywhere
Devils in the eyes, babies always cry
Papa never home, fuck it we all alone
Tryna get rich and that cork in right
Grab me the beaker, I'll measure the white
Heat up the water drop it in pot
Baking soda and ice cubes make it rock
Get you a saucer the razor go chop
Get you a Glock and invest in a block
Set up ya shop, dare 'em to pop
Fucked by the cop, jacked his ass with a shot, YAWK YAWK

[Hook]
I got my hustle, dog
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop, knock him off
Crazy, I got my hustle, dog
I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Knock-knock, knock-knock, knock him off

[Verse 2]
Satan in your soul, let it take control
Oxycontin fiends, keep the foil low
Let the pill burn, inhale exhale it slow
Let your heart explode, drop ya to the floor
I gets the dough, I hustle hard
Ace Hood ain't got shit on moi, green beans 80's fo sure
They like what I'm talking 'bout? You know what I'm talking 'bout
No syringes or nothing, just heroin's cousin, smoke mufflers out

[Hook]
I got my hustle, dog
I gets my hustle off, Oxycontin, heroin
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Chop-chop, knock him off
Crazy, I got my hustle, dog
I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all
Crazy, I got my chopper, dog
Don't make me chop him off
Knock-knock, knock-knock, knock him off

[Verse 3]
Only lords knows and only time'll tell
Will I go to heaven or will I burn in hell
Music in my mind, vibrating down my spine
Travels to my heart, shoulda been here from the start
Now I get bread from my audio
(Call me your pusher, these bars that I'm pushing)
You know I ain't talking a Xanny bro
(Nigga, we on it, be up by the morning)
You wreck a new bitch wearing panties tho
(Threw out my line) Fish up, for sure
(Nigga we eating ya) Oughts to know
Put my big boy in her love below
(There she blows) HiiiPower controlling
Our hustle keep going, sh-shitting on niggas
Excuse all our colons, boss after boss
Don't be pissed that we balling, we here for the moment
(We getting this cash) My flows be imported
My bitch be imported, my grind get distorted
Your life get deported, ch-ch-ch-ch-choppers deploying
Losing my brain while recording, um
