[Verse 1]
They say the gangsta's back, gave God a heart attack
Red eye insomniac, let's get this fucker live (yeah)
Loading up pistols while getting high
Forty-five nines who smoke and sending nickels and dimes
My little nigga 12, said he with it, yeah
Gave him a sherm stick and watched him while he hit it
Soon as he lit it, cuz was finished, now cock back the gat
Leave the mask and gloves, let's get to business
But they worried 'bout Osama
Kill the bitch nigga and get his family ma√±ana
Didn't get a comma, nor a cent, for the karma
Just an imaginary stripe, so he can hold his head in honor
Zombieland, a bunch of dead men walking
Living abortions, they oughta raise the price on coffins
They fucking make a killing, but I ain't dying up in prison
Fully-loaded clip my brain up to the ceiling

[Chorus]
Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know
(On my mom and 'em)
Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled
(I put that on my mom and 'em)
Fear around here, I smell death around here
(On my mom and 'em)
Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here
(I put that on my mom and 'em)

[Verse 2]
They say 2012 the world gon' end
Shit it been over since Raymond recruited soldiers
1969 evolution of devils time
Ain't walking up in no shrine shit, I'm living a life of crime
Pops never gave a chance my mom crying
She can see it in my eyes, I lost my mind
Sneaking out the window with angel dust in my Indo
Keys to her ignition new mission ya better limbo
Fire pits let to eject I hardly miss
Nigga ditch sleep on my dog ain't that a bitch?
And I ain't on my Odd Future tip
But snatch a nigga intestines from his nose and tell his ass to shit
But they worry 'bout Osama
Blood and Crip niggas lifetime of Jeffery Dhamer
Flashy for the moment I'm on it I pop your collar
Suicidal ain't fucking with these young wild connivers, we rivals

[Chorus]
Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know
(On my mom and 'em)
Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled
(I put that on my mom and 'em)
Fear around here, I smell death around here
(On my mom and 'em)
Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here
(I put that on my mom and 'em)

[Verse 3]
Didn't learn too much in school but I donelearned some shit
36 a kilo, 28 grams a zip
Pot brownies and white cookies
Cops'll pat me down but won't touch on my girl's tushie
Fuck, they sent the lady cop, they tryna book me
All else fails, balloon packs, tampon that pussy
Back to the set to laugh about it and get it off
Lobster tails and butter sauce, same clothes still a boss
On a mothafuckin' robbing spree
Probably be televised, bitch I want the world to see
Now you dumb fuckers heard of the
Sickest nigga out, I found out that blood's burgundy
But they worry 'bout Osama
9/11 passengers ain't seen this type of drama
Vietnam wars, I'm sending copper galore
Bodies hit the floor, God knows I'm playing lord for sure

[Chorus]
Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know
(On my mom and 'em)
Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled
(I put that on my mom and 'em)
Fear around here, I smell death around here
(On my mom and 'em)
Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here
(I put that on my mom and 'em)

[Bridge]
Make money, make money-money-money
Take money, take money-money-money
Make money, steal money-money-money
Kill money, my money-money-money

[Outro: Portishead]
Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come
