Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to

Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day I guess
For a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast
E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (Thats Right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see yall
All I do is kill shit ICU
Party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off, and they top off
I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say
To live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach
I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls

Every morning nigga I get blazed, aye
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored come and join the wave, aye
Girl what is your name cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you bout, uh
A little something in your rear, little something in your mouth, little something on your couch, uh
Know what I'm talking about, Bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch, uh
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind, I want your behind

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play

Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart

Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
