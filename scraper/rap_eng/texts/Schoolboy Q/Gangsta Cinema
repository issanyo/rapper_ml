[Verse 1: Slip Capone]
Recognize, realize, and analyze
Born in the place they call gangsta
Hawthorne, Californ-I-A
All the way to Philidelphia, PA
Pass gall project, Richard [?]
Around the corner from the bank, the steady B robbed
Respect the bandana
Banana clip in the hammer, smoking Joe Frazier
Street lights, street fights, three strikes
Khakis and street nights, what it look like?
Gambling, three dice, see the blue and red lights
Shootout with police like free Ice Mike
Handcuffed in the back seat of the car
I swear to god, life shouldn’t be so hard
S O S, same old shit, it never fails
A white man’s heaven is a black man’s hell

[Hook: Philly Swain]
From gutter to gutter, hood to hood like
Philly to L.A., we living the hood life
From the days of getting the hood white
To nowadays we living the good life
Gangsta living, a gangsta cinema-a
Gangsta living, we can’t pretend for ya
Gangsta living, a gangsta cinema-a
You get out of line, we putting an end to ya

[Verse 2: Philly Swain]
Gangsta cinema, in your ass like an enema
If I send for ya, homies’ll disfigure ya
Philly Philly for really, I’m from the end where a nigga will put an end to your heart
Cold as december bruh
K clicks leave whole cliques dismembered, bruh
Fry your eggs and scrambled
The candle’s how they remember ya
Collie, teeny-boppers on they bullshit
Ain’t got a full deck but he got a full clip
RIP Eazy E, but shit is ruthless
Home of Montell Jordan, this is how we do this
Preachers of LA getting paid out the pulpit
(Lord forgive me), had to sneak that in on some cool shit
Realize that real eyes booked the hatred that fueled this congregation
Is clueless, what I’m saying is useless
Mexican and blacks need to make truces
Wisdom gang recruitment, this a new movement

[Hook: Philly Swain]
From gutter to gutter, hood to hood like
Philly to L.A., we living the hood life
From the days of getting the hood white
To nowadays we living the good life
Gangsta living, a gangsta cinema-a
Gangsta living, we can’t pretend for ya
Gangsta living, a gangsta cinema-a
You get out of line, we putting an end to ya

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Know where to find me
Look up in the sky, probably on that plane
Headed to the place you call gangsta
Where motherfuckers pack a burner
And niggas take shots, no chaser
It’s on ‘til the morning, walking through Philly like I’m back home
House shoes on, bring the grip like a python
In the projects where fifth graders act grown
211 stick ups, killed over fake stones
Moms screamed “Why?”, killer fled unknown
Mad at the pawn shop and scared of alarm clocks
Waking up in cold sweats like army vets
Feeling down at his worst, liquor got him at his best
Shots blew out his chest, pill popper, X Man
Left the crime scene marvelous
Still remain anonymous
Cops couldn’t catch up to him, they slow up
Finally got away, oh yeah nigga, they po’ up
‘Til the cops got important tip
Big mouth, nigga snitched, sent ‘em all on a trip
Black judge, black D.A
White public pretender, guess they still hang niggas
Uh, gangsta cinema
ScHoolboy Q

From gutter to gutter, hood to hood like
