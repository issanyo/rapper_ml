[Verse 1: Bridge]
3 o'clock in the mornin', she was stayin' with me
Shawty laid it so proper, now she rollin' my trees
Ooh you so focused, that's how it looks
Ol' girl's a rider, oh so I had to fuck
And I know she bought an O for tonight
So you know I'm gettin' blown all night
And I never say it, oh baby
But you know she had my love on the low

[Hook: Bridge]
All cause she roll my weed, oh when she roll my weed
Roll my weed, oh, oh when she roll my weed
She got me, oh when she roll my weed
Roll my weed, oh, all cause she roll my weed

[Verse 2: Bridge]
Love the way you model, when you wearin' my tee
Girl you can be a model, but I keep it lowkey
Shit came way from Colorado, how she keep it discreet?
Doin' what you gotta, roll it up for me
She got one hand on them zig zags, got both hands on that cake
We've been faded way too long, girl I can't feel my face
But I love it, and you know this
Got my lovin', and you know it

[Hook: Bridge]
All cause she roll my weed (she roll my weed)
Oh when she roll my weed
Roll my weed, oh, oh when she roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
All cause she roll my weed, roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
Oh when she roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
All cause she roll my weed, yeah

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Swear you rise me off my feet
Swag beyond your reach
I work  my magic on that beach
You face and shoulders in them sheets
I just might Active with my leaf
I got my wood, you keep your sweet
Ridin' slow, windows down, off a pound, bitches on it
Say that last nigga was broke, if he had had it, woulda sold it
Rubber bands, 50 grand, in my pants, Instagram
Put that Cali in the air, feelin' rare
Roll my weed if you's the one
Let the smoke glide off your tongue
Let the beat move through your body
Girl you gon' feel as real as they come
Smoke an ounce of flight before the flight
Got your ears, hands and necklace iced, right?

[Hook: Bridge]
All cause she roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed
Roll my weed, oh
Oh when she roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
All cause she roll my weed, roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
Oh when she roll my weed
Oh when she roll my weed, roll my weed, oh
All cause she roll my weed
