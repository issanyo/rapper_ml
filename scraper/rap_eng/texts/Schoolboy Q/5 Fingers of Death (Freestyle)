[Part 1:]
Jump up on my wee-wee
Oh oh, go jump up on my wee-wee
Fuck me on my ten speed
Gangsta of the century
Tell Rocky I want Iggy
This niggas getting rail road
Take yo' bitch ass to the nail shop
Ring ring from the gun shots
Brings her shoes back from the bailhop
This year from the gun loving, shit firin' and the migos
This here from the real lo' true Figg side gang deebo
[-] I remember you, he was way aside being turned down
In supermax getting supermax
With your hip gold and your nose ground
Hellbound I don't fuck 'round
[ - ]  my name on your building
And I'm suicide to the children
I speak crimes to the millions
All night won't sound like
Pitchfork, no website
All night, what's this like

[Part 2:]
Look at this here spitting
Nigga de-de-did it
Booyah, lil nigga gon' make me go double digits
Cause he murked up the block
My magnun go outta lock
My forty controlling your nina
Still on the wigg shot
When we had no pot to piss in
We would implot the mission
Took me right out the mission
Took me right out commision
Murder, mo murder, mo murder
Murder, mo murder, mo
Keep on [- -] bitches
And snitches they gotta go
Money, mo money, mo money
