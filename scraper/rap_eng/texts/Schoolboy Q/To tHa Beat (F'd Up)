Pop another one in 5, man this ain't the half

Getting twisted, trippin every night like Vegas
Her friend gon' eat her friend

Uh, back with my niggas ridin four deep
Bumpin' Kendrick, poppin' pills, prolly OD
With my nigga Soul, groovy off the OE
My lil nigga foulin, she supply the tree, Paul Jeremy
Ay, get me higher, uh
Roll the windows, pack your car, I'll flat your tires, uh
A nigga stressin', take me from my priors, uh
I think I'm comin' down, just make sure I'm the highest, uh
