All of that false claiming
Have you in your thoughts hanging
Them bullets deport, aimed at the top of your heart
Get Kaiser all blue for the cross, shoot better then cops on the force and forcing your life as a corpse
Of course he cremated and tortured around with the set i endorsed
Either my hood or die from your choice
You're silent, which fuck up your voice
And two till ya throat and your boys, and amigos are seeking destroy
Trip and you enter the void, you should've been trying to avoid
The stance says my troops are deployed
You get super-soaked with the toy
Crumbled in chip to the ahoy
Cuz your mouth forget, kneeled to the floor
Body look bloody and gory, DA ain't getting the story
Gunning like Robert Horry, guzzled in OE 40
Back to the block and banging, nigga what set you claiming Becareful on what you saying, these bullets be super saiyan
Run around all black now ball go blat
Rata tat-tat meta eastern gat, a armeniac
Kinda chubby and fat
So under my tummy strapped, hopping up out the lat
Like that
