[Verse 1]
What it do, young niggas? What it do, young bitches?
I got my drink in my cup, I got my Backwood, no Swishers
And bitch, I'm faded, fucking faded, yeah, I'm famous
What? I'm famous, fucking famous, nigga I made it!
When I was broke, I got me that nine
With that nine, I hit me that lick
And then with that lick, it came with that yola
With that yola, it came with your bitch
And see now your bitch, she gon' work on that corner
I don't care if that ho got pneumonia
Give me racks and you won't get a quota
She don't run game, I'm the only controller
So what's up now? Straight pimpin' over here
And I put that shit on Vers, nigga
I been checking ass all on the curb, nigga
You could tell that she fucking with a Figg nigga
What it is, nigga? Perrier Jouet Ros√©, I might relocate
Out of my mind, this world, I'm high, goddammit, I'm fly
(Yay-yay) My grandma showed me my first strap
My nigga Rat-Tone always had the flyest gats
I finally got mine... dirt nap
Real niggas don't die homeboy, we multiply
And shit, come around my town you clown, that's suicide

[Hook]
Gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, we

[Verse 2]
My momma said don't be that, the little nigga that sell crack
Gangbanger that street jack
Always trying to figure where the beef at
Knock-knock, put your brain on the doormat
Bitch nigga, what you call that?
We on block patrol, nigga fuck your roll, got the gat on me
Nigga look, it's right here, bulldog bark, you could die right here
Real gangsta niggas don't have no fear
Real niggas never tattoo their tears
Hopping out of vans, disturbing your plans
All hoodied up, no Wu-Tang Clan
Three J's letting off through that Aryan, call that bitch 3 for 10
I'm fucking up the streets again
Tags on the toes all amongst your friends
Let the barrel spin, get blended in, embrace the funk
Groovy as I'm running through your system
Seem like you only target Hindu victims
Red dot, chicken pox type symptoms
Sad day, had his whole family sickened
Trying to state the facts
We don't care if he elect you black, we got a strap
Gangsta shit, she with me if I'm broke or rich, I got a bitch
Ain't sober, kush odor, kush sodas, crip stoner
Real soldier, head off shoulders, makeover

[Hook]
Gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, we
Gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, G
Gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, groove
Gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, gangsta, gangsta-gangsta, Q
