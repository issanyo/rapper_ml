[Verse]
Good, uh, shit
Checks I still ain't cashed, you know I'm eating bitch
Still be strapped, hit it from the back in my bucket hat
Share the stack, young millionaire still ain't got a plaque
Shows be packed, step up on the stage hoes have a heart attack
Run the map, T.D.E. for life, droppin' fours in Sprites
Feelin' right, yes I'm back to sippin' just might die tonight
Balla' mane, all this Balmain, shit ain't been the same
Say my name, ScHoolboy fucking Q and I don't fuck with lames
Hoover block, where them gangstas pop and turn it up a notch
Knock knock yawk
Clip be hanging low aimed at your kisser though
Mistletoe, oh bitch get low or you gots to go
Told you so, should have got your dough
Now you're fucking broke
