[Mase]
One two, we don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, we won't stop
We won't stop, you don't stop

You already know that, I am the man
And, I'm always right, and, never wrong
You already know that, I am the man
Cuz, I'm always right, and, never wrong

[Kam]
Yo, check it out
I'm the trife one, Cease you got weed, let me light one
Girls of different cultures, chinese to the white ones
Home players, wild thing girl slayers
Cuties, big booties, Big gave Coogies
Black white beautiful ain't nuttin I won't do for you
Backside so thick, won't fit inside a hula hoop
Shine on me baby, pour wine on you baby
I'mma drink it off your back, got a problem with that?
Fellas get me, sip Crist', count fifties
Split Phillies, girly girls they bet are you a Willie?
It's a trife world, ain't gon be nasty, you a nice girl
Liz Clayborne dresses, diamonds to white pearls
Wild thing though, do lot of things low
Make a wise man grow to a live man a show
Only problem with the trife one is I stay low
Blowin lye with guys who got they eyes on my dough

Chorus: Mase (singing)

We got riches, we got bitches
You want drama, we got guns
I'm that kid, from Harlem World
And you know where I'm from
Now my team, is out for cream
And you know exactly what I mean
So any click tryin to stop us
Is the click that gets seen

[Lil' Ceasar]
Yo, yo, yo... Ceaser Leo, aiyyo
Aiyyo wherever I go buy all hydro
Lie low so I don't get harassed by five-oh
Used to be in the red star, gettin my head slobbed
From the old school ho that swallowed the egg nog
I chill of course until I feel I'm the boss
Until they got Lil' Cease face on the Source
Got girls that be clever, that's on another level
Tell me I'm your hero, Cease DeGeanero
Need a wild thing, so the town can swing
Pull the hair back and forth, layin pounds of cream
Bet Cease break your crutches with a crowded team
Fulfillin wishes to they misses with a thousand dreams
I got, mouth to feed, pretty childs to breed
If you really drinkin babies, youse can swallow the seed
When it come to the sex I like it better on your knees
Fore I hit the kitty cat, gotta check it for flees

Chorus

[Kam]
Aiyyo nobody used to speak to me
To launch paper got me Geechie G, now every broad
Keep beepin me, frequently, know the frequency
Just to speak to me, yes leave with me, but recently
Get Proposals, of Indecency, but can't cost a penny
Cause now I want Moore than Demi, but I ain't mousy
Matter fact, we can get rowdy
But only green papers with the faces arouse me
Now I know what a woman think, but girl I'm top ten rank
But I only get hard when I see Ben Frank in the bank
It don't pay to baby don't show up
But know what? Better catch me fore my price go up
I'm a ho slut for the dough but, I want the paper
To come, til I throw up, so girl grow up
You need to slow up the stash, I ain't all about us
Cause a nigga like Kam all I need is my cash
I want my money...

Chorus (3X to fade)
