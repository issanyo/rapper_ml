[VERSE 1: Dez]
Girl tonight my party didn’t start til you walked in (yeah)
And the way you looked at me I hope this feeling never ends (no no)
There’s a lot of ass up in this room but that on there is special (and you know it)
Girl all I really wanna do is make my nasty thoughts come true but only with you

HOOK
I can’t get enough (do me baby)
I can’t get enough (and I’ll do you lady)
I can’t get enough (it’s so crazy)
The way you make that body move I can’t get enough of you

[VERSE 2: Dez]
Tell me what’s up all I wanna do is have a good time (sweet little baby)
C’mon back that thang up on me oh wee all night
I ain’t on no bull shit real talk that’s how we live oh I can’t deny
When my hands are on your booty it does something to me
I want it in the worse way shorty put it on me

HOOK (repeat)

[VERSE 3: Ma$e]
I wanna sweep you off your feet fly you to a beach
Show how much I love you in a language you don’t speak
Lobsters or chop sticks tell me what you eat
I do anything to put a smile on your cheek
Ask for a day, I give you week
Ask for the car Imma buy fleet
Everybody in here all together can’t compete
Every time that we get together it be sweet
Match made in heaven, snatch you out your sevens
When you don’t get your love drug then you start stressin
What am I forgettin, girl when you come around, you change my settings
You the only one I let in (come in)
You the type a girl that I spend a safe on
Tryna to keep up with them nigga’s up in Greystone’s
Then you see another chick and wanna break phones
When you want it girl come straight home
