[Intro: Puff Daddy]
You ready Mase?
Party people in the place to be (uh-uh)
It's about that time for us to (yeah)
(screams)

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
Yo, what you know about goin' out
Head west, red Lex, TV's all up in the headrest
Try and live it up, ride true, a bigger truck
Piece all glittered up, stick up kid, nigga what?
Jig with a cut sip Cris? Spit it up (come on)
Ho's ride, get your nut 'till I can't get it up
I'm a big man, give this man room
I done hit everything, from Cancun to Grant's tomb
Why you standin' on the wall?
Hand on your balls
Lighting up drugs always fightin' in the club
I'm the reason they made the dress code
They figure I wouldn't wild when I'm in my fresh clothes (come on)
Dress as I suppose, from my neck to my toes
Neck full of gold, baguettes in my Rolls
Wreck shows, collect those, extra O's
Buy the E, get a key, to the Lex to hold
East, West, every state, come on, bury the hate
Millions, the only thing we in a hurry to make
Whether friend or ex-friend in a Lex or a Benz
Let's begin, bring this BS to an end
Come on

[Hook: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
You make me feel so good (bad boy)
You know you make me feel so good (yeah)
You know you make me feel so good
(That's what we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (come on)
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (ah-ah)
Come on

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
You can't understand we be Waikiki
Sippin' DP til' the TV, look 3D
Little kids see me, way out in DC
With a Z3, chrome BB's, they wanna be me
Nigga's talkin' shit they ought to quit
I'm fortunate they don't see a fourth what I get
And those be the same ones walkin' while I whip
Just started seeing cars because they auctioned it
So while you daydream my Mercedes gleam
And I deal with ho's that pose in Maybeline
One time you had it all I ain't mad at ya'll
Now give me the catalog, I'll show you how daddy ball (That's right)
Six cars and power to fire big stars
Sit up, CEO style, smokin' on cigars, nigga
It's like ya'll be talkin' funny
I don't understand language of people with short money (Come on now)

[Hook: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
You make me feel so good (come on)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
(That's what we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could
I wouldn't change you if I could (come on)
I wouldn't change you if I could (ah-ah)

[Bridge: Ma$e]
Do Mase got the ladies? (Yeah, yeah)
Do Puff drive Mercedes? (Yeah, yeah)
Take hits from the 80's? (Yeah, yeah)
But do it sound so crazy? (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Well me personally, it's nothin' personal
I do what work for me, you do what work for you
And I dress with what I was blessed with
Never been arrested for nothin' domestic
And I chill the way you met me
With a jet ski attached to a SE
Smoke my Nestle, no mad rap-ASCAP
Where my check be?
Problem with ya'll I say it directly
Went from hard to sweet, starved to eat
From no hoes at shows to m√©nage in suites
Now I be the cat that be hard to meet
Gettin' head from girls
That used to hardly speak
Come on

[Hook: Kelly Price & Ma$e]
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
You make me feel so good (uh-uh)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good
(Bad boy, that's what we do)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (ah-ah)
I wouldn't change you if I could (come on)
I wouldn't change you if I could (let's go)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (yeah)
You make me feel so good (uh-uh)
You know you make me feel so good
You know you make me feel so good (Come on)](2074294)
Bad, bad, bad, bad boy (Don't stop)
I wouldn't change you if I could (ah-ah)
