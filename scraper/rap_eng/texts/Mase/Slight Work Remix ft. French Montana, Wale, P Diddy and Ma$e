[Verse 1: Artistrii]

You see I never really knew that I'm the newest hit. Music's how I'm doing it

You can never say that I'm not able to be doing shit

Now I'm coming back with this remix, it's how I'm proving it

Sticky situation like somebody has been gluing shit

I'm on one, only if the boot fits

On to the next one

On to that new shit

I am getting money but, only for my benefit

Staying true to God cause I'mma do this for the hell of it

You know what, I'm gonna keep it real and keep it simple

Mind is the engine they say the body is the temple

Call me Mr. Selfish, doing shit all by myself

Cause I ain't got not the time to be relying on anybody else

Call me Mr. Truthful, I ain't gotta lie

Cause I'mma do it for myself and I'mma do it for my pride, yeah

Keep it on the low, but I'mma do it high

Got my head up in the clouds cause I'm that kind of fly

I'm the one to keep it real cause I'm that type of guy

Swimming in those rivers that you women seem to love to cry

No need to hate

Cause my flow and style is in date

And there's nothing that you can do

But just sit back there and relate

Cause there ain't no doubt about it cause there ain't no shit to debate

Cause I'm blowing up like balloons but bitches like you deflate

Raping this beat, you can call me abusing

Talking a load of shit, you can call me confusing

Stay ahead of games, I'm doing it for my name, but I look at you in shame cause ah, nah you're losing

TeamUK, right up in London's where I lurk

You can count this remix as nothing but Slight Work. Slight Work



[Verse 2: French Montana]

Brand new drop, I'm riding through Harlem

500 at the villa ain't no problem

Plumber in the back seat, pipe work

Chasing them checks, Nike work

Red bottoms with the spike work

Making a movie, Spike work

Pink drank on, Sprite work

30 chains on, bet the light work

Get it, I spend it, cop white Ghost tinted

Smoke a whole pound in it so you know it ain't rented

25 on the bear hoodie, go and tell PETA

10 million off of mixtapes before I drop a single

Slight work



[Verse 3: Wale]

Young Folarin, gold bottles, we so thorough

My new flow bought Hublots below zero

Old sneakers that's worth more than your new apparel

I'm on one, no two-steppin' in Margiela

If you got a blunt, then we got 2

If I got a blunt, you might gotta move

I don't like to stunt, but now I got to

To celebrating the fact that I'm not you!



Okay, shake it, shake it, shake it

Can't wait to see you naked

They cannot see me cause when they see me I'm getting faded

Double M we the greatest, women is on the couch

They tryna get it in, we gotta point 'em out

And then I dance on 'em

I bet your __ would too with this cash on ya

Okay hold up, just might dance on 'em

Let's say we have a long night and a fast morning

Work!



[Hook: Wale]

Slight work, slight work

The wrong drink, the right work

Slight work, light work

The wrong drink, the right work



[Bridge: French Montana]

(Work, work) Talking 'bout a slight work

(Work, work) Talking 'bout a slight work

(Work, work) Talking 'bout a slight work

(Work, work) Talking 'bout a slight work



[Verse 4: Diddy]

Get a bottle of Ciroc and take a chopper to the party

Then cop a Bugatti just to let the Oscar ride shotty

How could not admire me? Jocking my men entirely

Chop the top off the drop and tell 'em Basquiat inspired me

I step up in the spot, they get to working hard

She bend it over, make that thing look like a work of art

I'm the one all the bosses call the boss

I fathered the game, feel like I'm watching my sons floss



[Verse 5: Ma$e]

What you want me say? What you want me do?

Different kind of money make different kind of moves

Different kind of dudes wear different kind of jewels

Different kind of drop on, different kind of shoes

Wear my hat to the back, I'm in a different kind of mood

You get a different kind of chill from a different kind of cool

Think they mad with my past, wait 'til they see my future

Only dude from the unit, MMG recruited

Getting money like I'm Jewish, get attention like a nudist

Got a cult following of bad broads like I'm Buddhist

As a student, I'm a truant, and you know my mind affluent

Think you clueless then you foolish if your crew don't have a Judas

Wanna know what I been through, what you into

Put it all on the table, do it like a menu

Get you wider than a venue, humming like Hindu

Feeling like a dream and nobody pinch you

Slight work...
