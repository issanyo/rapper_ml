[Intro]
Uh
This is what I sound like after 5 years
(You back kid)
Why do I feel I still got the floor
(You back kid, Bad Boy for real, Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Before '99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Me broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up
Been a change of plan
Rip your old plan up
Instead of hatin'

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 2]
Some days I make thousands
Some days I make millions
Spend my day chillin'
Coupe's with suede ceilings
Everybody out there wanna know what Mase got
Way hot, gray drop, Maybach, gray yacht (Whoooo)
And that's just the way it be
Favor, people wanna pay for me
When I'm in Mr. Chows, they waive the fee
And I don't chase money man
Money chase me
I give my wife things that she dream and more
I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)
I'm back like Moses to bring the law (Come on)
Brand new saint Mase in mean velour
I had bling before you ever seen the tour
Fans from Iran and Singapore
And grown men beg me to bring them on tour
Even if it mean they gotta sleep on the floor (Let's Go!!)

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go

[Verse 3]
I used to be the guy stood next to Diddy
Crucified, for bringin sex in the city
Even though the girls think I'm extra pretty
How I know? I ain't got no extra wit me, oh
With the fist tight flow
Wit a wrist like whoa
What if this might blow
Ain't no if I...
No
I'm the man to plan the way
This ain't my life
I've become a saved (Say what)
Put up a good fight
Like its mandalay
Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God time now, and I don't plan to play
I'm only here for the one thing you lack
And make dj's scratch is he is he back
Kids in the hood stutter it's a it's a fact
It's the kid resurrected it's a it's a wrap
(As we proceed, to give you what you need, he's back)

[Hook]
Awake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go (I wanna see yall out there)
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(Let's work this, let's work now)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(Let's work, Turn the lights on somebody)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go (Let's work)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go (Let's work)
Wake these people up and show them they keep dreamin'
(hahahaha...I like this right here, I like this right here)
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go
Breathe Stretch Shake, Let it Go (For real, Bad Boy)
(AHHHH!)
