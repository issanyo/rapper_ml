Hook:

Geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote

Geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote

Geronimo, you took it slow
And you need that antidote, boy you need that antidote

Geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote



(Three, two, one, GO)

Isolated segregated quarantined and underrated
SMS you left a message my response was automated

Peter piper picked a pepper and he got real aggravated
Found Jill up with Jack and he swore that it was fabricated

I will be the catalyst to win your vote unanimous
Couldn’t stop me in my tracks I diagnose paralysis

Switching up the roles so you can make me the antagonist
As I hinted earlier not at your bar inadequate



Flip threw the pages see if you can find the real me

I do this with my own style I hope that you can feel me

Don’t give a single fuck if you don’t like me excuse me

My life is a book because it’s better then the movies

Hook:

Geronimo, geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote (No)

Geronimo, geronimo don’t take it slow (Oh)
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote (Oh)

Geronimo, you took it slow
And you need that antidote, boy you need that antidote

Geronimo, geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote



I don’t know what to freestyle about and I don’t know what to say (To Say)

I’mma just keep going fast like I’m departing from LA (LA)

Spit the whole truth nothing but the truth did you study your lines? (Your lines)

Brewing up over time my flow is like a fine wine (Aye Aye)


Abreviation complication liberation reputation
Come at me lets start a war and I will sign the declaration

Consultation conversation I don’t need a demonstration
We do this ourselves and we don’t need any coordination

I do this for fun and one day it will be occupation
If you think of stopping me leave that in your imagination

Say what I want to say your witnessing no filtration
I’m the product of nobody I’m my own god damn creation

Hook:

Geronimo, geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote (No)

Geronimo, geronimo don’t take it slow (Oh)
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote (Oh)

Geronimo, you took it slow
And you need that antidote, boy you need that antidote

Geronimo, geronimo, don’t take it slow
I don’t need no antidote, I don’t need no antidote
