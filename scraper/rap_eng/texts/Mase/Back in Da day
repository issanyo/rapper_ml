[Mase]
Yea, I just wanna see you doing good ugh

[Verse 1]
From the first day I met you I knew you were special
You had a lot of drama but I used to protect you
Being you was nieve I could not let you
Do a lot of things so I had to correct you
Thinking that if you went left instead of right
Right now what would your life be like
And me you know I love the good life
And you I know you hate the hood life
I watch you as you turn and turn
And burn and burn from all your decisions
You could be a christian rich somewhere
But you ain't choose to listen so get somewhere
Its never too late till its too late
Right now If you's with me you'd be living in a new state
Riding around with new plates
Living in a new place
But you couldn't tell your crew wait
Come on

[Chorus - Female Singer]
I wanna go back to the days
You stayed and you were loving me
And I was loving you
I wanna go cause I would do so many things so differently
Baby me and you would still be together
I wanna go back to the days

[Verse 2]
I see you on the beach
Feed her rose petals
I tell you the truth but then you wanna go settle
A girl like you is on a whole other level
Tried to move you out the hood but you scared to leave the ghetto
I told you anything you say you can have it
With me I always spend a million on my fabric
Established and lavish carrots is a habbit
I'm married and that don't mean I want you looking average
I thought you known that take you where your zone at
Peeps in the street talking like they own that
I talk truth but they only want facts
When you wanna do right you know where your home's at
I tell you wait on Lennox that means wait a minute
Bracelet tennis face it we finish
And just because you're not my girl
It doesn't mean you're alone in this world

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Mase singing]
I'm in love with a girl named Tyler
I'm in love with a girl from Mississippi named Tyler
I'm in love with a girl named Tyler
I'm in love with a girl named Tyler Betha
I said Tyler Betha
You know I'm in Love
I'm in love with a girl named Tyler
I'm in love with a girl from Mississippi named Tyler

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
