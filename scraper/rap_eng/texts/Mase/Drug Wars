[Intro]
What we mobbin' for?
Another day, another dime
In a drug war for living by the thug law

[Verse 1]

If you saw me in the streets kid you wouldn't think that I'm a thug
Fade parted up the middle with the diamond stud
But I come raw, with the rawness, no preservatives
And murder pigs, and hurt the niggas who don't deserve to live
My crew and me had a tendency to smoke the remedy
Watching for the enemy so we can live infinity
When i do a pack i'm wishing niggas watch my back and listen
I can't go back to prison dawg i need the capitalism
Though i squeeze, I'd be damned if we plead insanity
Pump weed, grams, and keys just to feed the family
A while ago I was in the street living foul for dough
Pulling calico you try to front, you and your pal with go
In the jungle that's expected all the humble kids are hectic
You rumble get your neck split then you stumble to the exit
Blocks are ever raided by a bunch of Bethas hated
Out the block they never made it ? devastated
When i was in beef it wasn't no howling police
Brothers spent hours of grief in front of flowers and wreath
So if you try to bring the beef kid i bury you
Go to the viewing with your crew and kiss your mother she's hysterical
Thought that I was safe when i was strapped with my fam till they attacked
Me and my man in the candy apple Lam
Put 12 in the vest with one shell to the flesh
Then I fell on my chest dawg my skeleton red
They tried to murder me but through surgery the doctors carried Mase
And now i'm in the alley waitin' thinking bout retaliating
Vexed so, tec blows, organs in your chest show
You're petro, know you can't live so you let go
Erase clicks and chase spics, don't get your face split
Every nigga in the place trip when Mase flip with lace tips
Plenty niggas I done searched and sliced, took they merchandise
And told them niggas keep it if it's worth they life
To tell the truth man i'm as trife as they come
Kidnap your wife and your son and put a knife through your lungs
And everything that i recite is quite subliminal
Plus the whites in general be treating all the blacks like we criminals
That's why i stay killing all them immigrants
And when they walk past tenements i throw bottles like i'm ignorant
And that's my murder autobiography
And my immortal anthology take no moral apology
Because once i lose i get low and put a fool in a yoke
Put the tool to his throat take his jewels and his coat
Nowadays you gotta smoke with a brew, ain't no hope for the youth
Niggas get scoped from the roof
And during the daytime we don't delay crime the pay's fine
Spray nines to kill the cops and the canines
Straight up and down I walk the town with the tooley
A clown tried to do me pop a round in the mooley
Niggas think they got it sowed now because they got a 4-pound
Niggas get blowed down frontin' in my hometown
You never thought that maybe Mase would be the one that ladies chasin'
Murder the ? race with more guns than a Navy base
Streets I don't doubt none, death will be the outcome
When you talk to Mase kid you better watch your mouth son
