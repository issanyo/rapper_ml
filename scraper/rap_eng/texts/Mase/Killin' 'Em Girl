[Verse 1: Mase]
We ain't never gon' breakup, I solemnly swear
If we breakup, promise we gon' makeup
I promise to get it 100 and never do no favours
I promise to never leave you cause I know I can't replace you

[Verse 1: Slim]
I know the sun is gonna shine, I need time with you
I know the clouds might get dark
But my heart will always get through cause I'm with you
We kiss and we makeup, that's how we do

[Chorus: Slim]
Yeah we never gonna breakup just so we can makeup
Not messing all your makeup
She love the way I beat the cake up
That's the only way and we never ever gon'
Breakup just so we can makeup
Not messing all your makeup
She love the way I beat the cake up
That's the only way and we never ever gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
Yeah we never gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
Yeah we never gon'

[Verse 3: Slim]
I know sometimes you feel in your mind, things that you find don't always seem true
You know I'm down right from the start
When it gets hard you know we'll come true cause I'm with you
We kiss and we makeup, that's how we do

[Chorus: Slim]
Yeah we never gonna breakup just so we can makeup
Not messing all your makeup
She love the way I beat the cake up
That's the only way and we never ever gon'
Breakup just so we can makeup
Not messing all your makeup
She love the way I beat the cake up
That's the only way and we never ever gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
Yeah we never gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
Yeah we never gon'

[Verse 4: Mase]
Hop up in everything, we ain't breaking up baby
Half put down for that thing, ain't going nowhere baby
Money got me up to the point that I'm aggravating
Broke up for no reason, added up being calculated
Got a master boo but of course she say she missed me so much
No mistletoe but they all wanna kiss me so much
Black power, one finger up, don't give a fuck
I know you wanna leave but I don't care enough

[Chorus: Slim]
Yeah we never gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
Yeah we never gon'
Cause you're the only one that I want
