[Intro: Mase]
This is what you do (that's right)
You take nothing, you get a passport
You meet me by the plane (that's right)
Be gone
I'm gone

[Chorus: Jason Caesar & Mase]
I'm taking you home tonight
Jason Caesar
It must've been something I said
FATBOI, Euro
And
The hottest thing on the planet, man
And, and
Come on (come on)
I'm taking you home tonight
I need you to believe, can you believe?
You believe?
It must've been something I said
Alright
And
I'll see you when you get there
And, and
That's right

[Verse 1: Jason Caesar]
Oh, don't look no further
Mr. Right's right here
Who can show you sights like me
And book these flights, my dear?
If you wanna leave with me (you got it)
Spend a couple G's with me (you got it)
The way you can drop the top
And watch the moon

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
So come (get a taste of this life)
And if you want (we can make it for the night)
I got whatever you like
So come and go with me

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)

[Verse 2: Jason Caesar]
Some girls look for lovers
Some girls look for love
I can give you either
Or all of the above
If you wanna shop in Paris (we can take a flight)
We can make love in Rome (we'll come in tonight)
I'll be your Cassanova
If you let me take you home

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Caesar]
So come (get a taste of this life)
And if you like (we can make it for the night)
I got whatever you like
So come and go with me

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)

[Verse 3: Mase]
You know, I may take you home and get you straight in the zone
Without a taste of Patron and me be making you moan (take that)
I ain't trying to run your life, girl, you can keep your blonde streaks
Even keep your Manolos on if they really [?]
Fan since, like, seventeen; now she, like, twenty-two
But when I send for you, we gon' do what centers do
I hope I'm not offending you, but what we finna do
Shorty's gon' remember, boo, so just surrender you

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)
I'm taking you home tonight
It must've been something I said
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame (and)

[Outro: Jason Caesar]
And, and, and
Home tonight
Guess she like the game (and)
Guess she hate the lames (and)
Guess she love the fame
