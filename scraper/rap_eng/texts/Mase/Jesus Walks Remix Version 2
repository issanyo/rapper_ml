[Ma$e]
This song right here changed my life... come on, come on!

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down

[Verse 1: Common]
Open your eyes, there's smoke in the skies
The Beast is holdin' a lies
Everywhere we move, motion denied
Emotion derived from posters of pride
Of African, cultures and tribes
Who live when we suppose they die
Laugh when we suppose they cry
The pain we holding inside
Cause all we really know is survive
Use that to remember we're kings
That's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings
And cutless supremes
Seen Diana Ross remember that my sisters is queens
The Lord is coming -- for now, he visit in dreams
For every mission it seems impossible
Speak to the gospel to remind me what God can do
When it's not logical
To those in hospitals and prisons
Low-income living
For them I say a prayer keep giving
Learning to receive
My heart is burnin' to achieve
Even when it's hard to breathe, I still believe that

[Hook: Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
And now I think there is something that I can say now that'll right my wrongs
I finally talked to God, I ain't afraid cause His love is so strong

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Jesus walk with me, he walk with the sinners cause I know I am
But I ain't no loser, I'm a winner and I know I can
Overcome the devil for he get the best of me
My daddy always said G-O-D gon' have tests for me
Illegally they told me to lie when they question me
But God sent an angel that said the truth will set you free
So in the midst of getting sued for more than my deal
I admitted I fell asleep at the wheel
Cause I realized I could've died, he saved me
Every single hit that got played he gave me
People ask me "Do you read your Bible?"
"It could help out when you need revival"
There's something about this beat that get me tranquilized
And when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
And he give me direction when I can't decide
He is alive! How could you tell me that he ain't when I said



[Hook: Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Before you take my name, take my fame
While you at it take my shame
Take my flaws, take my blame?
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt
See my bruise, do this and you will walk in my shoes
You wasn't there when I was in deep thought
When I had two choice: kill him, or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller, that's why I say what I'm saying
And the only thing the radio is playing
Is because you be paying
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beasts will knock no more
So who cares who flop no more?
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And only law dudes can disguise
That your favorite artist (shhh)
I know you hear that (huh?)
You wanna fear that? (what?)
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Icon to rap is like John the Baptist
Prepared the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, having thinking Jesus
Really didn't need us, when He loved the old days
He loved them boys in the hallway up in Broadway
Even those who be here for dope, every four days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player gators in Marbres
With me, it's not just bars of music
I walk with God, I got the scars to prove it

[Kanye West]
God show me the way, now the devil can't break me down
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Outro: Ma$e]
Everybody out there
Just lift your hands right now
Just say this with me
Father, I thank you
For forgiving me of everything I've ever done
For Jesus walking with me
For dying for me
Raising for me
And all my sins have been forgiven
I'm a changed man
I'm healed, I'm delivered, I'm rich
And it's all because of him
Now walk with me
Walk with me, walk, walk, walk with me
Walk with me
