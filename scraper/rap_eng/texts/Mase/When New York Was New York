[Verse 1]
They got me back on the two train
Black hoodie, camouflage with my blue 'stang
Protect ya neck like it's Wu-Tang
Gold-tech boot, different color boost rings
Y'all niggas couldn't miss it cause you never had it
When I was wearin' fur, you was wearing rabbit
Turquoise blue Tiffany, a nigga back at it
And my Teflon got my six pack padded
Got a 'matic in my attic, you want me to grab it?
Pussy just like I thought, nigga you's a faggot
Niggas trippin on the set, this is Harlem at it's best
Pick it, point it at your neck with an Audemar Piguet
Phantom though, nigga in the game, I'm an animal
Ouija board, rap nigga channeling my flows
Take a trip to Philly, find the next Amber Rose
Put her on a flight tonight, Huggington or toes?
I'm confused, can't choose, Lamb' or the Rolls?
Nigga got me crenshawed talking sign language
If they don't talk that, talk nine language
.45 fire language, they say misery like company
You don't need a Reebok deal to get a pump from me
I flash guns, even Puff had to pay me
St. Patrick's Day, nigga every bar crazy

[Chorus]
(Yeah x6)
When New York was New York, it sound like this
When New York was New York, it sound like this
When New York was New York, it sound like this
When New York was New York, it sound like this nigga

[Verse 2]
Freaks know my face, fans know my scars
Groupie know my car, fans know my bars
I knew perdico with chico, I'm talking El DeBarge
.44 toting, no emotion, I had no regards
Niggas know what happen in Manhattan, I get crossed
Jump off sides, no coin toss
I need no applause, you know what it cost
Wide-body eyed, you know the exhaust
When you're this fire, nigga you could overcharge
Inappropriate to say I'm bossy, nigga I'm a boss
Cheat coming but I know the angle
The card on a nigga probably black as Django
I'm no saint no, the roof get to missing nigga, I'm Criss Angel
You can't change no freak to a housewife
Even if it's a ticket and cash
You're tricking nigga, I'll buy outright
They say I'm minister or sinister
Just remember to tell 'em how bad I'll injure you
I owe nobody, all my friends are dead
And don't call collect cause I ain't talking with the feds
I beg your pardon, there's no need to beg
My ears is stuffed up, all I hear is the bread
Half a mill on a carry-on
Push your waves sideways like Farrakhan
I'm who niggas tattle on
Build empires like Babylon, tell them niggas babble on
I'm who the farmer bet his cattle on
Four hundred thousand dollar skateboard
I'm wilder than the niggas in the eighth ward
You want what Murder got? You gotta save for it
So many hits, they think the nigga take 'roids (I'm juiced up)
Trippin' over turf, one chirp
Get your whole block merked, niggas know what murder worth
I lose none, I win some
The llamas add commas to my income
And they ain't even gotta give me gun
I'm trying to get a B, I'm living on the run
In the interrogation room, I never gave 'em none
Remember where I'm from, anything to get it done
I dress her like a nun, I send her through tears
Say brick 51, then shoot you when I'm done
From the Chi to Dubai, groovin' guy really had a knot
And June Embro, she must have dressed me in the sky
I fly in Italia, it's no nostalgia
Your pay might be to dress like me, I'll style you
My money in the floor, gotta lift the towel up
Shoot up the prosecutor, they ready to get a trial up nigga
I'm just another pretty face, given stakes
Yellow Ferrari brakes on a 458
While naughty girls with no manners sit on my lap like Santa
I'll have 'em drinking Ace like Fantas
I'm like a scale, I ain't never gave a gram up
I never gave my man up, I never put my hand up
I never hit the stand up, I never took an oath
I never wrote a quote, I never signed a paragraph
Even through detention, I never signed [incendant?]
To the cops, I'm uncooperative, niggas don't know how I live

[Chorus]
