(Intro)
This is Murda!
And you listenin' to "Crucified 4 The Hood"... Volume 1! "10 Years Of Hate"!
Y'all know how we made it...
Hahahahaha!
Yup, you-yup-you' pa-POM!
Yeah!
Yo!


50 you came to Scoop nigga
Now I'm a burn this joint down! {Whoooooooooooooooooooooooo Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
I got the metro! - Petro! - The Tech blow;
Echo!
I make niggas in the club - move like it's techno
Chick scream: "Heck no! " - Flow this crazy
I gotta get a cheque for rap version of Creflo. {G-UNIT RADIO! }
You hear it in my flow that I done fathered niggas
I chill, go to church and I don't bother niggas. {AAAOOOOOHHH! }
But I'm gonna get mine regardless nigga
And if you keep frontin' like a champ', I'm a Tarver niggas;
Come on! - We got the "Unit" it's not a "Gorilla"
You got no beef it's not over scrilla
Bunch of loud mouths and I'm a concealer
This is "Murda" nigga, I named you "Killa"!
Yeah! {GET BACK! }
Word in the street is Murda is home
And the broads don't wanna leave Murda alone;
Come on! - More Franklyns than Aritha
Go against Ma$e Betha and be ready for a ether
Think I'm soft, but check it this is off the record
If I brought it to a nigga if'd be off the record
{Whooooo! }
Uh! Slow down easy! Go down greasy!
Nigga take one right, give him 4 rounds easy
{Whooooooo! }
Ain't no "ands" or "ifs" man, when I'm in the mix man
Like I'm ambidextrous I pop left, switch hands
{Whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo}
An loved in everyway cause I'm a rich man, {Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid! }
I open niggas chests like vicks man
{DAMN! }
As in the M-A-$-E days
I throw chicks on the bench like the 6 men!
2 drops or more! - Blue fox to floor!
New drop azure! - Tube sox araur!
A flow this crazy then who dropped the ball {COME ON! }
The most controversial since 2Pac Shakur. {NONE STOP! }
I'm givin' ya niggas murder with all the ice-off
I'm grimey like the park with the lights-off
I'm not Roy Jones I never take a night-off
I'm tryna get my money up to get my niggas mics-off
And you don't want a problem nigga {OOOOOHHH! }
I feel like '97 Harlem nigga
So calm! So witty! So don! So pretty!
And if I - lift the mink up, I'd blind the city! {SHADE 45! }
I put a .9 on the line. - Them dimes coming with me
And I'm finished with Bad Boy now I'm signed with 50s! {OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH! }
You think I'm in the booth still, cause I got the coupe's still
Kriss back and forth - like how the crew chill
Can we by the restroom, ring like 2 mill'?
So on the back, there it's good for 2 fills
I take her to the backseat where Jacob in the back
She like Ma$e, come mess up my make-up in the back. {COME ON! }
Come here an' get rowdy rowdy! - I just pipe her
Then I give her back to her man to wife her
Most she get, probably school clothes an a Chrysler
But you get bizarre - take it way far;
Like I slayed the raw, 'till I say tomorrow
You rememeber me - for toting that thing around
{Whooooo! }
For half a century - they been throwing my name around
Chicks get fidgety! - Everytime I came around. {"CRUCIFIED... "}
Now it's the enemy! - Plus I got the anger now! {"FOR THE HOOD"! }
You know I pull up on the - Block! Big grey - tost!
Your mixtape - host! - Get straight "Ghost"
This thing in my diesel - put out so many shots
You can feel a breeze through. - One of your Boys; please dude!
Something to give me the right to leave you. {IT'S THE UNIT! }
A hole in your head so big you can put a key through;
Cousin I'm it! - Your Uncle Festa!
That B2K flow; I might molest ya
Don't even come unless you coming for real
Cause right now I give you one that you won't even feel
{Whooooo! }
'Fore you even get the nerve to put your gun on my grill
You better speed on the highway, sleep under the wheel
If you know like I know. - You just lie low!
When you hear the fire go! BLOW!
BLOW!
BLOW!
- Hit the floor...
{COME ON! }

It's kamekazi! (I run for the door!) - Tell everybody! (yeah!)
We got the C4 to blow up the lobby
Grab that ammo!
- Cock the shotty

Yeah! {WHAT? }
