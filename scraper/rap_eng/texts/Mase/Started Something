[Chorus: Daphne Larue]
Understand me, you fucking with The Family
You know who my man be
(Niggas done started something)
Ungrateful, I see what the hate do
Even though we made you
(Niggas done started something)
If you try to play me, you're crazy, crazy
(Niggas done started something)
If you try to play me, you're crazy, crazy
(Niggas done started something)

[Verse: Fabolous]
Yeah, you bit off more than you can chew
Ain't much more that I could do
Than go look for you niggas, I got a warrant for your crew
Y'all done got me started, put me in this position
Pushed my buttons, put the key in my ignition
Nigga once the engine running, I'm coming to injure something
Fuck me like I'm sex, promise revenge is coming
Sometimes, can't wait for karma to get 'em back
And momma said, "if they hit you, you better hit 'em back"
See, that's how I was raised, that's how I'm not phased
'Cause I'm worth too much nigga, that's how I appraise
I done cut off the frauds, disappeared enemies
I'm not a fan of phony vibes, and weird energy
Even a friend of me, started hating on a G
It seem petty, like Bruce spelling his Kaitlyn with a C
Man I see it all, if he tazed me it wouldn't shock me
Dog I heard it all, if you Jay-Z you couldn't rock me
Couldn't knock me, so they had to go another route
White sheets over you, for helping undercovers out
Like Thanksgiving day, slide through your mother house
We gon' pull them muffins out, blow a nigga stuffing out
Shorty you know nothing 'bout, finishing games
This the flow that blemish yo' name, diminish yo' fame
Boy your whole style is trash, your image is lame
I'll set yo' ass on fire, then extinguish yo' flame (woo!)
From start to finish, I finish then I start again
Ran into yo' broad again, I met her at the Party Inn
Fed her that Bacardi then, spread it like accordions
Then she made it clap for me, better than a audience
She say you keep calling, tryna get her into arguments
How you was cool, but now you sweat her like a cardigan
Once you get a real nigga, get rid of the fraudulent
I can handle that baby, tell me where he at baby

[Chorus: Daphne Larue]
Understand me, you fucking with The Family
You know who my man be
(Niggas done started something)
Ungrateful, I see what the hate do
Even though we made you
(Niggas done started something)
If you try to play me, you're crazy, crazy
(Niggas done started something)
If you try to play me, you're crazy, crazy
(Niggas done started something)
