I give 'em nothing but game till it's stuck in their brain
So once it's stuck in they brain, yeah my funnin' began
I'm in the want-ad, lookin' for a special woman
That's gonna gimme what I need anytime I want it

Then let you float out on the beach
With the string o' yo' "g"
I need a pretty momma
Silly momma, diddy poppa
Like that go to great adventure in they mini-chopper

And make me do my sits when I finish my dips

Yo, real chicks do real things
Like find a man wit' a deal that still wanna sling
Always speak my mind whenever I feel things
Probably got no wings but i'mma still swing
And my real chicks feel what I mean
Am I right? am I tight?
Do this chick bring it to the light
Is my body so right I could even attract a dyke
Uh baby stase, uh baby stase
While you was lovin' john doe
I copped a condo
While you was layin' backs down, I was layin' tracks down
I see it for a fact now, it's intact now
It's no need to beef, it's my turn to eat
Bring the drama to a cease, cars I don't lease
I push a green z-3, watch a screen tv, what
I'ma forever rise
Rings be tetra-size
Girls be petrified
It's a heavy meza-ride
Repeat 1
