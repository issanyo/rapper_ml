[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yea, ok the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn (Let it burn)
Yo friend took a molly, it's yo motherfucking turn (Yo turn)
And y'all know all my money straight (It's straight)
Like a motherfucking perm (No perm)
And all I get is brain, and still ain't motherfucking learn
Hold up, nigga right now, turn the lights down
With a thick bad bitch and she light brown
And she gone make that ass clap, for a real nigga like right now
Oh, and I'm iced down, but that pussy so wet I might drown
With my swimwear, I jump in there, like splash

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Fuck hoes we don't love those
Nigga you don't live by the thug code
It's levels to this shit, it's metals in this shit
And several niggas get introduced to the snub nose
Stomp niggas out till the club close
Leave a nigga shirt filled with mud holes
All my flows they love those, we ain't the same set
But you wearing blood clothes
I'm loaded now, fuck you talking 'bout?
I just left the judge, I just met your bitch
That mean it's going down

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Man what it look like, being a nigga got the lot of y'all
Little snitch nigga like a fly on the wall
And I'm in a chick head like Tylenol
And I roll up in that black 'Bach, Matte black or that black Lac
And I put another hole in your snapback, step back, act bad
Who said something, I ain't getting on nothing, nigga picture that
Pop that nigga, stop that nigga, drop that nigga
Watch that nigga, rock that nigga, we get it back
When I turn up, niggas wanna chill
Niggas wanna chill? I figured that
Murder back on that old ish
Point me back where the strippers at

[Chorus: French Montana]
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
Know you see that coupe when we ride
(Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
I'm talkin' right now, right now
Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now
Light the motherfucking roof on fire
See that coupe when we ride
