[Verse 1: Mase]
Who got all that old money, plus that new cheddar
Six coupes and better, with Snoopy on his sweater
That ice on his sleeve makes it hard to speak
? cars and chiefs, show me a car receipt
I don't believe it, you know I'm an unbeliever
Joint so hot, had to leave the join in the freezer
Cruise in the two-seater, one of my divas
If you didn't see my chick, you didn't see her that long
If it wasn't top bank, then it was Nia Long
I just blaze along, bump the same old song
The same OG, know I'm the same old me
Every chick I the club put a claim on me
You know I got money, look at the chain on me
My wrist and my neck, everybody give me respect
My life is ruined, got players white pursuin'
If I paid for the telly, all night we screwin'

[Hook]
We gon' make it right you know what I mean
Cause every girl that chased the night be running after me
We gon' make it right, and you know what I mean
Cause everything that shines bright ain't even what it seems
Oh we gon' make it right

[Verse 2: AZ]
This an extravaganza, snap ya cameras
Relax, I'm blue, black, from that sun of Savannah
That blue, black with some fun in Atlanta
Loop's having a party, told her come in pajamas
Cheuffer driven, let's toast for living
No one going to heaven, this is as close as I'm getting
Rap life, I'm like the Pope in prison
And we barely ever spoke religion, suited up
In all concert jewels and such, it's years later
And my nigga ain't lose his touch, it's still in me
Started with the Baileys and Henny
Now it's barely Grey Goose with Grenadine and Fendy, clothes trendy
Wardrobe Louis and Fendi, if niggas knew me
I know most would truly commend me, then they envy
So, one by one, girls, come caress me
Undress, molest me, but you can't possess me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mase]
From the streets that niggas don't know
Like Grand Rapids down to ?
Where girls faint for a photo while you still promo
Oh no, you got to get your shit straight
Half these niggas only hot on the mixtape
Only loved in six states, I'm loved in 46
Probably can hit, any fucking shorty they with
Be they man, when I leave, then they call me a bitch
Make your block go hot, they can't pump ??

[Verse 4: AZ]
Yo this is glamorous, Spanish chicks
South Beach bikinis, sun tans and sip
A hundred and sixty thou on my hands and wrist
Get me how I was raised on some family shit
Streets is in me, go where the reefer send me
Sick thoughts was taught not to be so friendly
People stress, fanatic, got the ease on sess
Understand after me, there will be no left

[Hook]
