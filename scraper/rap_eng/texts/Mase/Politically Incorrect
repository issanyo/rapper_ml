(Hook)
I'm politically incorrect
Don't make me wave this Uzzi at yo neck
They say that I'm from generation X
ADD niggas don't know what I'm gon' do next

(Verse)
Petra all on my back mo' rights niggas
Who kill animals than blacks (facts)
Last night I sent a letter to the White House
And startin' to feel that I ain't send the shih to the right house
Mike Brown striked down, errythin' is on site now
Rappin' niggas got nothin' say
Who gives a what about ya, iced out
Black boy and foreigner rainy night down in Florida
Dispatcher said don't follow him
How the hell he end up with the coroners, I don't get it!

(Hook)
I'm politically incorrect
I neva sell my own for a cheque
They say that I'm from generation X
ADD niggas don't know what I'm gon' do next

(Verse 2)
Be real with us
Ya a dope boy and ya deal to us
Ya made killin' in these streets
But guess what ya killin' us
That's why somethin' goes array, people die
Ya don't feel for ya us
Ya ain't build for us
Ya ain't trill for us
Ya ain't kill for us
Ya ain't deal for us
Be real with us, we know it
While my heart beat like its a metronome
It got me wonderin'
Is Obama gone protect his own?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah I hear all the talk
But I'm also watchin' Zimmerman and Wilson walk

(Hook)
I'm politically incorrect
I neva sell my own for a cheque
They say that I'm from generation X
ADD niggas don't know what I'm gon' do next

(Bridge)
What I'm gone do
What I'm gone do next, no
What I'm gone do
What I'm gone do next, no, no
What I'm gone do
What I'm gone do next, no
What I'm gone do
What I'm gone do next

(Hook x2)
I'm politically incorrect
I neva sell my own for a cheque
They say that I'm from generation X
ADD niggas don't know what I'm gon' do next
