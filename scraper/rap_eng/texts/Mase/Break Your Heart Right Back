[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he’s gone, you’re alone
Don’t want you back
You’re telling me you’re sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Not doing this again, no

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don’t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause
Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate, but I don’t know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

[Chorus: Ariana Grande & Childish Gambino]
Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back
Want you to cry me a river
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby loves me
(Does he really though?)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tell everybody
I'm coming out, he’s coming
I'm coming out
