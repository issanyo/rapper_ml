[Bridge : Ceerock , Sharon Matos  ]
Sick &Twisted 3x
Don't get it twisted ( aah) ] 2x


[Verse 1: Ceerock  ]
I didn't have many problems
I don't have many problems
I think that my only problem
It's not having many fucking problems
I've been frustrated these days
So devastated these days
Evil is sophisticated these days
Everything is so complicated these days
They ask why?
Why do you waste time
Looking for a sign
Or another things that define who we are
While the other guys are becoming the stars
Damn young Cee,you became so bizarre
I've been searching things like I'm a freaking cientist
I've been making questions to discover what the world is
I left my teacher speechless and then I got dismissed
He said I need help Asap cuz I'm so sick
But I'm not ill , and I can't heal
It's not even a big deal ,ngga this is how I feel
And im not saying that The ngga is made of Steel
But nobody can make me go against my will
Look, I thought about spitting some trashy bars
Just to be a freaking star
Ngga I'm trynna take over, reach the goal getting closer, making moves always sober, conscious like Lamar ,oh my

Sick&Twisted 3x
Don't get it twisted ( aah) 2x
Trying to discover the truth
While still in my youth
Before getting all of the money
Before they start calling me honey 2x


[Verse 2 : Ceerock  ]
I'm trying to discover the truth,  aye
I'm trying to know my roots, aye
I cannot follow these rules,aye
Bcz I'm different man I ain't no fool,aye
Y'all nggas look like the same
U wannabes should be ashamed
I see The world in my own way
So u should be quiet cuz u such a lame
Aye, I am so cold even though we in The summer
Technology improving even though we getting dummer
But dont get it twisted come on ,we cannot suffer
The ngga is getting richer even though he is a sucker
But The problem is : we always complain
And the ignorance is taking over our brains
But fuck dat, fuck you and fuck everything ( aye)
When you talk about the future bruh don't forget my name
But we ok, we ok we can survive
Information getting twisted but yoo, we cannot lie
Cee is the king ngga I was sanctified
Conquering the empire so a ngga gotta fight
I was trynna follow all the rules, but hold up
I stopped for a while and this idea came up
Don't pray to be famous, and just do your thing dawg
And don't kiss no ass cuz  u won't feel the same dawgg

[Chorus : Ceerock , Sharon Matos , MASE   ]
Sick&Twisted 3x
Don't get it twisted ( aah) 2x
Trying to discover the truth
While still in my youth
Before getting all of the money
Before they start calling me honey 2x


[Outro : Ceerock , Sharon Matos  ]
If I say that I am the best ?
Don't get it twisted
If I say that u won't last ?
Don't get it twisted
If I say tha I am The GOAT ?
Don't get it twisted
Nigga u know how it goes
Don't get it twisted 2x
