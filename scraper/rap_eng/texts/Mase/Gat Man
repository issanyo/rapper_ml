[Verse]
How could you not remember me, i put you in the industry
Gave you niggas a flow, and now you actin finnacky
Now anything that can brought 2 chains, 3 bracelets on
Is probabl just mimmickin me
Im what the game never seen, Jewlerys hard jello green
Lacoste a four rock a New Era with a lean
It dont take too much to drop a dutch on a caroussine
Youz a rookie ima veteran, i can carry any team
Niggas like broads, always makin the comments
I pave the way, niggas should be payin me homage
I carry ?? like im Isaah Thomas
I love beef, some niggas use to say im islamic
You be happy i turned reverend, or 7 to 11
In front fo 7-11 with a brand new Mac 11
I catcha with the ratchet and i prolly wouldn't pray
Better yet i probably wouldn't play
I prolly be in the kitchen witcha Mrs., wrap a body with Yay
Buy my cars in Miami while i shop in L.A
With the same prosecutor that put Gotti away
So niggas is you copyin Ma$e or copyin Jay
Make up ya mind, i'll take you niggas 8 at a time
See how many you can take from this 9
I get so much cake without crime, see you niggas sayin from mine
Tryna get this nigga Ma$e to resign
I needa say, the coupe color prolly 9 millimiter gray
Front on me that be the day, Stunt on me you eat a K
Come to the point SLR just my extra car, parkhouse, penthouse
Overlook your resivoir, better i pray for em
And lay for em, polish the AK for em
And make his block hot as May for em

Yea..yo Whoo Kidd im in the catch 22
Tryna not to catch 22
If i go to church niggas say im takin the money
If i come in the game niggas say im takin money
No matter where im at its like im takin the money
So just leave it at that nigga im takin the money!
Yall done woke da beast up, i was sleep
I ain't even gonna lie to ya niggas i was sleep
I was snorin, i was in a coma
But now i smell the aroma nigga moneys in the air
Lets do it, who wanna do it with the kid haha
Yall niggas dont want me yall better stop playin
Anythin you put on my head i can match it nigga
And then spot you 20 nigga, MURDA
