[3LW]
You Do or you don't don't
You will or you won't won't

[Kiely]
I'm getting little tired of your broken
Promises promises
Looking at your pager
Seeing different numbers numbers
Call you on yo cell
You hangin' with the fellas the fellas
Hangin' with my girls
You always getting jealous and jealous
I was with you
When you didn't have
No dollars no dollars
Hangin' at the crib
Chilling with you mommy yo mamma
Never fronted you never brought the drama
Now you flip the script playa please

[3LW]
No I'm not the one
Say it again say it again (oh)
No I'm not the one
You do or you don't
