[Intro]
This a classic just add this to the rest of them

[Chorus: Mase, (Kanye West) & John Legend]
See I know what y'all like (Yeah)
That's why its gon' be alright (Turn Me Up)
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
(If Yall could feel how my face felt, you would know how Ma$e felt)
See I know what y'all like
That's why its gon' be alright (Come On, I Hear John Legend)
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
<>Ooh
Holla back its gon' be alright
For real its gon' be alright
Mase is back its gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mase said come on, Mike said shamone
Let's start it up early like Raven Symone
Keisha Knight Pull, Emanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothing handed at all, but did I complain
Every time magazines tried to taint mine name
But y'all can't hold me down like restraint
I took the "t" up out the word can't
Around the same time Nas said I can
Bush was sending our fam' to Iran
I'm in the club with Henny, ass in my other hand
Lord, please forgive me I'm just a man
Right now I'm trying to make some adjustments
'Fore they do me like they did Janet adjusting them
Me and my cousin them, trying to rap like Busta and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I ain't never ever accept no money
From these so-called sponsors
They was in Benzs, I was in Hondas
Now I'm wondering where they all at like a nonda
Hmm, that's something to ponder
The money y'all make on this one's for Donda
That's West to you
You the next, I can't hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it some decibels
And put some more zeros in front of that decimal, nigga!

[Chorus: Mase]
See I know what y'all like
That's why its gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
See I know what y'all like
That's why its gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
Holla back its gon' be alright
For real its gon' be alright
Mase is back its gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Arm froze and all, Dom Rose and all
Maserati, Bugatti, the roads and all
Different color Louis open toes and all
I tried to tell the chicks don't expose it all
Country dude's mouth full of golds and all
Bay area chicks, cornrows and all
I do it right I do my wife, I leave the hoes to y'all
Close the boutique, I might close the mall
I jerk my [?] in Turks and Caicos
I wave the Rollie you wave the Seiko
Need I say more, more diamonds than LisaRaye
I'm no replica, I am the DNA
Breeze through leave you like the  hurricane
Somebody get killed the whole borough blamed
M-A dollar what a thorough name
No matter who come through I'm forever the king
I should've never left the game its what a kiddie say
Still, chicks throwing me up like newlyweds
I'm grown and sexy done with groupie head
In the milk-white Phantom, the seats are ruby red
You hear the rumor listen to the facts
I drive my cars in pairs like pity pat
When I drop the track it feel like Biggie back
The game is country I came to bring the city
I came, I came to bring the city back

[Chorus: Mase]
See I know what y'all like
That's why its gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
See I know what y'all like
That's why its gon' be alright
Every day and all night
Mase is back it's gon' be alright
Holla back its gon' be alright
For real its gon' be alright
Mase is back its gon' be alright

[Outro: Mase]
For real put your hands up
G.O.O.D. Music put your hands up
Bad Boy put your hands up
Roc-A-Fella put your hands up
Chi-Town put your hands up
NY put your hands up
Miami put your hands up
Texas put your hands up
Tennessee put your hands up
London put your hands up
Japan put your hands up
All around the world, all around the world
LA put your hands up
ATL put your hands up
Man, this gon' be...
