Uh-huh, yea-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, (Tell 'em who we is)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They call me when they wanna get they dough up
Call me when they wanna see shit blow up
Fresh from the floor up
And ya know what? I'm sick wit it the shit don't slow up
I'ma see it, want it, drop it, cop cat
Get it, stay on it, don't stop cat
In the big chair wit the big hat screamin' "Y'all wanna floss wit us?"
Where the fuck you at?
From the south side, ruff ryden on one wheel
Fuckin wit' us, is a done deal
And y'all gotta hate, huh?
'Cause it's too much weight for one
And y'all ain't havin' no fun
Got a whole beat team tryin' to do what I do
Whole street team tryin' do what I do
Like what? double countin' me out?
Forget it, i'm the best that ever done it, need to check and reck

[Chorus: JD and Cross together]
(Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Now, money ain't never been a thing to me
I'm down eight with the brand new Cinammon 3
OT, I got cake with a C and a D
On the wrist is a ice band capitol B, small V
I'm fuckin' with the Don Chi Chi
I'm a P-I-M-P, you can't tempt me (Uh)
Check the ice and the clarity, it's cake like the lottery
Playa don't lie to me, your stash couldn't cover me
What a playa wannabe, neck light in [?]
Hoes, I keep those by the, dime or dozen
I like short-a-y, but i wouldn't, mind her cousin
It's a cost, take the buck and all of them, quit fuckin'
UHH!!!

[Ma$e]
C'mon, C'mon, C'mon
We be the best harlem niggas 80's to lately
Think of Po Wop, Mickey Bonz and A-Z
Fresh Ritz Zit, Kevin Giles and DB
And at the end of all tha shit niggas still say me
I'm the best that ever did it, got a way wit it
Put grannie on the stand, she'll never say who did it
I'm from where, even the gangsta's live to
Make a mil. on the stoop, every summer switch boots
Cats change they name, to Phil like a giant
I treat rap like packs, role dills on consignment
This is for cats hummin' crack, bitchin' and parkin'
All the grimie niggas who got generous hearts
Got a brother doin' life, to see him is hard
Fuckin' wit mase, is like a nigga swimmin' wit sharks
My niggas chase cake, play some infa-reds
Some niggas in the state, some is in the feds
Spit shit at niggas that might erase they head
And role miserable niggas who can't wait to be dead
All Out, Ruff Ryde mothafucka, All Out
Wanna flow BEYATCH?!

[Chorus: JD and Cross together]
(uh, uh, uh, uh)
