OBH, let’s go, nigga
Geahhh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Now, bougie bitch dialing me
Just for my salary
Move weight like calorie
Fashion fatality
Roof like the galaxy like I’m outer space
Bitch, you not the feds
It’s no nigga I chase
‘Fore I met Puff, I was a backpack rapper
Stuff my Louis with millions I’m a Rat Pack rapper
Lynch me Givenchy, double shark head
Italian sub; I’m ‘bout the large bread
Think blood’s in the Wraith
Where the coke car red
Never said I was dope
That’s what a NARC said
There you have it, I finally said it
Apologetic
Cash, no credit. Get it?
Niggas only die when I let it
Pellets
Put little niggas in the medics, dead it
All my niggas get cheese, get shredded
If I die for my kid to live, then I don’t regret it
I’m a bad bitch, fetish
I’ll send you to the fuckin’ Vegas
Better stop playin’ wit me
Mad shows, nigga, I’m really bothered
When the gat blow, nigga, I’m really startin’
You fairly retarded
You keep fuckin with mine
Get you dearly departed
When somethin’ get missin’...
I target the starvers
Jealousy harbored
Turn family to robbers
We tryin’ to see, nigga, who sell the largest
Who bail the largest
FBI get sneaky they all in the garbage
They thinkin’ they smarter
Well, we turn ‘em to martyrs
Need a bulletproof charger
You tryin’ to dodge it
Up and down the interstate for a dinner plate
You tell that nigga when he waits in a cake
Or get forced by me
The forth I leave
Approached by D
Of course I be the nigga who support robbery
Of any crews who talk ‘bout me
Get lost by me
‘Course I see the force I be
Niggas must not know the courts watch me
I bring to any hood autopsy
And feds can keep up when the horse hop me
Niggas like Murda always support robbery
No courtside seats, K-4th by me
On a coast as ivory, poison as ivy
Harlem’s only father, blocked from The Carter
Little nigga with the 9 like I’m Tony Parker
Grew up in the streets
Call it a under-learning
Them niggas hot-headed
And I’m doin’ the perming
Niggas see me wit 'Ye
They hear the Cruel Summer
So now niggas think they can take food from us
When you weak, you extorted
A boss never shorted
The money don’t come back right
The body rigor mortis

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Uhh...
Uhh...
Uhh...
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Eat, sleep, slay
Blessed in the body, blessed in the waist
You’re blessed to be my only bitch in the state
Jet red carpet to the Wraith
Y’all niggas keep key-keyin’, Ima spray
My shit shine ‘cause it’s newer
I bought my diamond from the district
For your Mrs. than a muhfuckin’ jeweler
If it means something to ya
I’m a 3 sum recruiter
Already know your bitch a freak
Don’t make me prove her
I’ll have a Bessie actin’ messy in Aruba
Hot fuckin’ hand
And you know it ain’t gon’ cooler
A couple sizes bigger with a muhfuckin’ ruler
I see you jumpin’ waves
Where the muhfuckin’ scuba?
Don’t put me in the lineup
I’m the muhfuckin’ shooter
She thinkin’ she the shit
I’ll leave her in the sewer
Let’s go, Kev

Ha ha ha ha ha haaaaahhh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, yeah!

You need more?
Aight
You need more?
Yeah
You need MORE?!?
Aight
You need more
Ok
Uh, one-two, one-two, one-two
One-two, one-two, one-two

[Verse 3]
Yeah
The whole world go crazy, nigga mention my name
BT week free fucked me for fame
Ever since I left this shit was never the same
Body counts rise, nigga touch my chain
Uh, fuck the small talk
Tall talk
That shit that y’all talk
That y’all could call talk
Bodies get hauled off
Beef can’t be called off
Shottys be sawed-off
Pointed at all y’all
BLAOW
It’s no way to go back
You don’t need me relapse
You don’t want me Kodak
Fuck yo cheese in the trap
Lil nigga, I’m no rat
I could send a bitch from jail
I send a ho mail
You know she wrote me back
Ima kill; zodiac
I’m in Big’s playlist
Big Big told you that
Now mama keep tellin’ me to wait
Be safe
Mama tellin’ me be patient
Fuck all that nine to five shit
And that day shit
That’s gay shit
Dropped outta school, that’s in my races
You let my ex tell it, I’m a atheist
I’m inconsiderable
Unforgivable
You’re too pitiful
I won’t pity you
Fuck you and your girlfriend
Shits so trivial
Ask questions, I said
“Bitch, I’m miserable, and I don’t have the fuckin’ time
To play with silly hoes on my line
Or to entertain sneaky bitches that be cryin’
Or to entertain freaky bitches that be lyin’
You are not mine
You ain’t second, bitch
And I don’t need a sign
Got a whole fuckin’ line of girls
Fine, tryna drink me like I’m wine"

[Beat switches}

Po up
Po up
Po up
Suge!
We got these niggas, D King!

[Verse 4]
Uh, yeah
Now ain’t nobody doper
Than the Harlem loca
I’m a pretty nigga
You are just a ogre
Diamonds in my choker
Smokin’ on a boca
???????
If I’m on the Vegas strip she want me to elope her
I don’t even know her
Every nigga rappin’ like me
Nigga, I’m the culture
Who am I? Who are YOU?
A night with Ma$e means everything new for you
Mohawk maybach lookin’ like it’s James Harden
We ain’t got the same roof
It ain’t the same car then
We are not the same, nigga
Youse a fuckin’ carbon
I am not a copy
I'm a burner on a hot streak
I’m the reason she come home, she be in the hot seat
Rollin’ down the Vegas strip with Suge in the Pac seat
A sub of syrup and some oxy-
Uh, let’s go, nigga

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Uh
You want another one?
One more?
It’ll seal the deal for you?
Ok

[Verse 5]
Yeah, let’s go, nigga
I got two bad bitches so I’m tourin’
Why every label in the world tryna get me on the horn
Kinda hung so the young
Wanna milk me like a farm
Call me Europe, ‘cause I’m always in a foreign
"Now, what you mean, nigga, you was in Milan?"
I had a brunette, I had to get a blonde
Some nigga take trips
Some buy ‘em all the gifts
But me, shit, I get it on the arm
If you don’t know my story
Stay around
Some niggas pay cash, some pay in pounds
Some niggas put pesos up just to lay it down
The trick in it’s
The other way around-round-round-round
That blue paper
The only thing I care about
Three wraiths speedin’ down 8th
‘Course I lay ‘em out
I’m not a muhfuckin’ movie
I’m Paramount
Nigga keep carryin’ on
Get your ass carried out
