[Verse 1:]
I, It's time to go
I will miss the past
You had it all but didn't want it
You played the part like California
And who you are is the reason you know who you not
That's why you standing in line darling
Why you need another shot
I need another shot give me another shot
Shot i need another shot
The world stop i need another shot
Give me another shot i need another shot
And don't stop i need another shot
Give me another shot just another shot
Don't stop

[Verse 2:]
I haven't been the same
I’m out my body
You’re like the flame
That never ever goes out
And when you do
All the guy tell me that you hot
That's how they discuss you baby
And why you need another shot
I need another shot give me another shot
I need another shot don't stop
I need another shot give me another shot
I need another shot and don't stop
I need another shot give me another shot
Just another shot don't stop

[Verse 3:]
Everybody plays a fool
They say i can rise and find happiness to break the rules
But give me a shot i have to try again
I promise i will be the perfect friend
You only live once and time to live forever
You live forever more
I need another shot give me another shot
I need another shot
Don't stop i need another shot
Give me another shot
I need another shot
Don't stop
