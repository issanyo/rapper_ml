She could turn the sand into glass
She could steal a jewel from the past
She could steal the sun out of the sky
Reach for a star never to high
Don't shoot me down
Not that you would
Don't pass me by...
Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
Never change (superstar, superstar)
Never change (superstar, superstar)
Never change (superstar, superstar)
Never change...
Intoxicate my every thought
Try to forget things I forgot
Don't shoot me down
Not like you would
Don't pass me by
Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream
Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
Baby she's a superstar who likes to dream (superstar)
Baby says to me her mind is never gonna change
Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
Baby she's a superstar (superstar)
