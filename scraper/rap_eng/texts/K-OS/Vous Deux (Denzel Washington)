[Hook:]
Mami has it bad everyday oh
Do let her know you love her bad

[Verse 1:]
We love you very much
And It’s the beginning of a hard day
When in I’m spending about to roll out
Holding hands with the  threat i progress
I stage on this microphone
Gold silver diamond studder i walk along
To the lobby of disease i came and see no tables
Life was simple when i dropped these hits on record labels
Now I’m a blackjack bagel with my ace in the stack
Throw your hands real high trying just to get by by by by

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
You see them chrome microphones females in arms
Else if it feel good do it like salome
Self help psychology my genealogy
Is king to El Hamid ringing and drumming
Fenamilaming i really like the new place I’m in
Move your body i make some mr mike magic money
Ain't nothing funny when i blast through the roofs
Like gas to the cats to the goose to the rusty rats
None lives here at last last last last

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yea call me the pine piper typewriter
The high lyric inside of serving the right writer
The night tiger the kid that makes you flip your lighter
The sole provider the high priest must think Mosiah
I’m on holy fire
I’m not a criminal not a killer I’m a thriller
Just let me know the J dealer
I’m realer than most ghost
The black Danny Ocean
So locomotion She’s coming
When you supposed to be toasting

[Chorus]
