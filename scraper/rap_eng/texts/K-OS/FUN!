Yee
Drop that beat
We dont play
Get back
Open the gate,dominate,pushing my own weight
Feelin vega omega was born in cassette tapes
In '88, hip-hop took control, back than when my girlfriend's name was nicole
Rest in peace her soul, we had FUN i think back, child prodigy gifted in black
Freestylin, we wildin banging on tables
I still have FUN, my trio Run, Dee, and Fable
Livin on cable, livin on T.V. screens, internet, dvd, what is this all mean?
My life is like a dream but inside i wanna scream cuz when i wear my sneakers n jeans i feel seventeen

My momma says get the C.R.E.A.M, but hazard this money scheme
To desecrate the art, and now i gave my heart, and delegate the sparks and admit
When the pen hits the paper from despise squairy and water vapor originator

CHORUS
Ive been here since it started
Ive walked a thousand miles
Im here to beg your pardon
To do a thousand smiles

And when the day is over
I hope your will is done
I hope your dancing over
I hope your having FUN

YO!
Look at the crowd they're jinglin
Everyones mingling
Hip-hop bringing people together
Tougher than leather, like Run-d.m.c
Its time to show up, blow up like t-n-t
Or stay down, like a nomad wearing a crown
I ricochet my vocabulary to slay
The fake, make no mistake we know who you are
Fake rock stars hiding behind guitars

CHORUS
Ive been here since it started
Ive walked a thousand miles
Im here to beg your pardon
To do a thousand smiles

And when the day is over
I hope your will is done
I hope your dancing over
I hope your having FUN!
