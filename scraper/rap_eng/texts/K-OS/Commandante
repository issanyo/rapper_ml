[K-Os]
This is an ambush
Yo, check it

[Verse 1]
Lookin' at my watch it's about that time to ascend with this art of Zen
Another rhyme manifested in the physical miracle emcee-in'
Leading to a revolution
Solution is seeing the mind as it rotates
Make no debate, when I regulate, all the gens will terminate
Cause we cut and slice irrelevance to the bone
And decapitate rappers that idolize Al Capone or Jimmy Hoffa
Not a hip-hop poppa, just a vigilante with the mic that I shot ya
Chopped up, beat 'em and we proceeded to rock the bells
Movin' quite well, so we got 'em hopped up
Trained, raw, like Big Daddy Kane
Plus I'm born on the same day as Kurt Cobain
Rap +Nirvana+, call me the beat piranha
Without the drama, yeah

[Hook]
Don't get this wrong
This revolution song
Hoping the wind can blow your way for once
A man is truly dead when confident
That's why we're all still waiting here so long

[Verse 2]
Astrologically, I'm the water and the fish
Made a wish, now I'm stone-cold lyrical catalyst
I don't eat fish, chicken or hamburger
But I eat 40 emcees on a hot plate
God's great
Magnificent and munificent
This is militant, in particular significant
To the people, masses,lower classes
Making the hardest of hard keloidal and flaccid
Contaminants with backstage laminate sheet unoriginal thoughts
That's why we stay adamant
Which we perceive to alter the mind-state
Making time wait, holding us up for hostage
I lost it somewhere back in '96
When it's safe I'll play the game, I'm back in the mix
With a brand-new bag of magic and pixie dust
Love hip-hop, pray it never turns into lust (take it out)

[Hook]
Don't get this wrong
This revolution song
Hoping the wind can blow your way for once
A man is truly dead when confident
That's why we're all still waiting here so long

Hey! Hey! Hey!

Aiiiiiieeeee!

[Hook]
Don't get this wrong
This revolution song
Hoping the wind can blow your way for once
A man is truly dead when confident
That's why we're all still waiting here so long

Commandante, come back home
Commandante, come back home
Commandante, come back home
That's why we're all still waiting here so long
