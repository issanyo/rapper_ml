Look in the back of bragg
In the midst of singing a dance song
Whatchu goin on about
???????????????????
I slept its many lane
?????????????
I`ve never been the same
Since that day
But there just this one thing, I don`t know
I don`t know, I don`t know, I don`t know
If the winner takes it all
I don`t want to lose the battle
And if the winner takes it all, takes it all, take it
I never said, I never said, I was the loneliest one
Or read between the lines of a book that means nothing
I never said, I never said I was out of control
You took your picture, wrote a poem and turned it into ?????
Get out my face, Get out my face
That`s your standing, I`ve assumed never landing
Get out my face that`s your standing
I`ll be landing from outer space
If the winner takes it all, I don`t wanna lose the battle
If the winner take it all, take it all, take it
