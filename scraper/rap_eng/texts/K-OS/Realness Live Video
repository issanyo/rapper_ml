[Verse 1: Intro Freestyle]
The vision is mine, vision I find
Vision within my godly eye
Godly path that im walkin' on
As I go off, I can never be on
This path that they walk
Cuz they all been the same and I am not like em
I just been heightened, in my state
Feeling the statements, racin'
They can't even mess with the holiest placements, sacred
Placements when I be placin' em'
I just gotta be the most ___ one out of the basement, dope

[Verse 2: Realness]
Revealing my realness
Appealing I feel it
I only get fresher they go out of season &
This is my cypher my life is completed
I stand in the coal when the moment is heated
Never defeated, pants never pleated
My flows they grow taller than trees is
Working so hard that I'm needing a shower and probably also a t-switch
Somebody offer me a coffee
These nasty girls been way too sloppy
And those who be judging can't covet the loving no wonder your slut has been getting too cocky
Loosen the lasso
No passin the pyro
I have been up in the flame
I'm Seeing the difference and god is my witness I can see the love in the hate
So its a new day, true say
Bringing it back in a new way
Killin' the game, everyday
Homie said no other way
Reversing the curses I'm purging I'm yearning i'm learning about the change
Loosen the lasso, hotter than pyros
Shifting mission, live in the flame
Difference defying the lying I'm trying to fly in the face of the greats
Horizon defying the timeless I'm flying arriving at heaven's gates
Right at your fate, Right at your God
Move with the matter the latter is wrong
Climbing the ladder this hatter is on
I'm getting mad as a Rottweiler, dawg
Can't tell what I been on
Support that I seen from my bae
Living my dreams, Break out the scene, I'm closer than I've ever been
Grinding like gears, Shining right here
Haven't seen the light in a day

But hip-hop's revived up in my eyes the power it don't go away
Hip-hop's revived up in my eyes the power it don't go away

[Verse 2: Fakers]
Fluent ridin vibin globin slippin slidin I'm arrivin liars dying they b trying driving fast I never tail
How u gunna battle that when you are probly still moving slow as a snail ?
