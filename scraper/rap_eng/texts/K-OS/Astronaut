[Neil Armstrong]
That's one small step for man
One giant leap for--

Hip hop is an astronaut

[K-OS]
Oh, doin' my thing
Made for rap seas like catamaran
And I gotta crush on a girl that sang Galang
Dope MC like Sook Yin Yang
Slang my slang is ostenacious
Slipping them scripts them Ellen Pages
So contagious so courageous
Goodness gracious let me say this
That
It's my time for breaking through
Cuz the clock is ticking too
Cook the beats with flavor brew
Like my man Santosh not you
In the bar individual this is some audio visual
Ish for you
All them haters caped crusaders
Like Batman, I punched him out
POW!

You could be pumping it
Pumping it chill, girl
You should be thinkin about it
Thinking deep girl
You better think about it
You better think about it
You better think about it
Don’t get too low

What's up girl?
Nothin'
What you doin'
Just here chillin'
Can I drop this?
Go ahead babe

Wish those kids watch Hanna-Barbera
I wish I had another me like Tegan and Sara
I wish I had a girlfriend that looked like Farrah Fawcett
Why should I keep it in the corner
I once fell in love with this girl named Lauren
Compared to Lauren all them girls were boring
Then I went away and when away on tour, and
When I came back Lauren had a new boyfriend
I said "Yo, L will you marry me, will you take me to the alter and rescue me”
She said "I'm not down with the groupie scene and all these girls on computer screens”
Oh man that’s what you see on the surface
I wouldn't have popped the question if you didn't deserve this
When they act high post fellas they’re real nervous
That’s why I drink POW!

You could be pumping it
Pumping it chill, girl
You should be thinkin about it
Thinking deep girl
You better think about it
You better think about it
You better think about it
Don’t get too low

I’m slowing down thoughts to the point of observation
I came from galaxies to represent this hip hop nation
I'm kickin' the same ol’ game with no name
Fame in the astral plane is ordained
Flame on!
Take it to the break of dawn
Evaporate and I’m gone

You could be pumping it
Pumping it chick, girl
You should be thinkin about it
Thinking deep girl
You better think about it
You better think about it
You better think about it
Don’t get too low

Now dance for me!

You better think about it
You better think about it
About it
About it
