Mic check, never ever lose the respect of hip-hop
Roamin' the streets in the mecca
I don't suck and jive and I don't dilly-dally
I keep the crowd hyped and packed like Don Valley

I rally with the emcee on the corner
But I'ma warn ya, I've got rhymes till the mornin'
Son, I used to push a Land Rover
Now I push a pen to the pad, the dream is over

Stop biting 'cause it's inciting
Need to send blows of flows and beat riding
The most spectacular vernacular actor
That y'all, bringing stature, combat your ego
But even that is a battle

So hard to keep my motives pure and not metal
Rebels without a cause, break laws
But I'd rather break food over the beat for the applause
Tours, I get 'em, holes in the game, I knit 'em

I wonder whatever happened to Sally in the valley
Hmm, it seems she's all grown up
Time to head to Miskoky
'Cause the game's sewn up

I've been tryin' to learn this new song
But I hear the same ol' music every day
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, to the, to the, to the, to the
Gonna fly with her to the Yukon
Gonna melt my soul on ice, then get away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Yo people, here I am, here I am, what?
Laid back in the cut, tryin' to construct
A stone house with an invisible mirror
So I could take a look at myself a bit clearer

Seen, if you don't get it then don't cram
Observe that you do, then you can understand
I was walkin' down the street when I met this girl
Who said she was in love with diamonds and pearls

Shiny new rides, plush leather seats
Baby, don't you know you're just reacting to the streets?
Be acting like a freak 'cause your daddy left home
Now you wanna rock in a man with his own

Bangs, girl, get off the bling-bling
Train is turnin' our people into insane
Feigns for cellular phones and blue jeans
Why? Because they want a piece of the pie

My abilita familifa, a quicker mind
'Cause I need to proceed, deep with a Godspeed
Envy, whack emcees, get the gong
K-dub lookin' above with new songs

I've been tryin' to learn this new song
But I hear the same ol' music every day
Hey, hey, hey
Gonna fly with her to the Yukon
Gonna melt my soul on ice, then get away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I don't wanna know how we came to be
All that I've been shown is there's only you and me
Help me figure out where this all went wrong
I think we need a new song, a new song

Word up, you know what I mean
Sometimes I, I just, it's music, it's music, we love music
Huh, to the, to the, to the, uhh, to the, to the, to the
To the, to the, to the
