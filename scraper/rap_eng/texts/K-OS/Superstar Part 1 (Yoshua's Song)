[Verse 1]
Ending is coming and fast is soon
I don't need your pain and adversity
Rising like the sun in the highest noon
I don't want to lose the ability
Look at how they coming and they hang me high (hang me high)
Leave me out here, hang me out to dry (out to dry)
Standing on the side like some parasites, waiting on their turn to eat
And in this game of destiny, every man is asking "why?"
Or how they want to govern me
I couldn't let them if they tried
And in my deepest, darkest side
He was there to ease the pain
So I give up all my pie, just to glorify his name

[Chorus:]
Tell me "how did you get so low?" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me "how did you get so low?" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are

[Verse 2]
And it doesn't last
When you turn the sand, into glass
They can steal the sun, out of the sky
Reach for a star, never too high
Don't shoot me down, not that you would
Don't pass me by, I'm not your fool

[Chorus]
Tell me "how did you get so low?" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me "how did you get so low?" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me "how did you get so low?" (so low)
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go (let it go)
Don't forget that you know who you are
