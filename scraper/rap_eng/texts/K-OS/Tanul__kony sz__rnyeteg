Swimming in your pool
To regain my cool
My coolness
Blueness
It's infinite
There's peace in it
Coolness
Blueness
Motion fills
The emptiness
Inside
As I dive
Right into your pool
Beware
If you're there
If you dare to be
I don't care
Cos' I'm swimming in your pool
To regain my cool
Swimming in your water
Babe, I'm swimming in your sea
Swimming in your silence
In deadly secrecy...
Because I
Dive
..right...
Into you
Swimming the sadness out of me
Swimming the badness out of me
Swimming in your pool
To regain my cool
There are bubbles on the surface
And fire lights my furnace
Ferocious is the beast I become
As I dive into you
Because I
Dive
..right...
Into you
Swimming in your water
Babe, I'm swimming in your sea
Swimming in your silence
In deadly secrecy...
