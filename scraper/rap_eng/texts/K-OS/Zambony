[Intro]
Do you have any idea of the chaos you have caused around here?
Nobody knows what you're doing
That's exactly the way I like it!

[Verse 1]
On the microphone like
God bless this planet, planet
Took life for granted, granted
This mic, mechanical, panic
God hold it single handed
Times like a left handed bandit
When right handed man
This bandit planned it
And propagandized it or Canada
It's so on ice and it's so raw
And yeah move yeah so power like thinking like a solider who
Would fall on his knees serve golden caps and such
To esoteric to touch
But, atmospheric enough to grab like a pink cat
Tag on a wall, b-boy at the park while DJ's rock the party
And mc's cook food for mr. pound it back
In the days when the rights outweighed the wrongs
Kid but, now the silly songs and electrical concerts
Don't leave a loop but I will just drop 16 bars on it
Life and death they roll in Siamese twins
So the day that hip-hop dies it's other life can begin
And we continue to

[Bridge]
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like

[Hook]
All around the world, we move it up
And yo we keep things striving
Soo high from heaven to the deep blue sea

[Verse 2]
Listen, I am not indie rock I was indeed hip-hop
With many styles I'm from the trine-ibal stop
No comma I'm my fathers persona
I'm ready spin my beat and maybe one day meet my momma
Sides I'm slinging verbs my intent is not sinister son of a minister
A bible thumping commissioner, finished an album
Scrap and draped the nostalgia of a cafeteria title
Battles just me and Nigel, now there spinning wax sticks, fixing the back seat crack
I can't entertain us, like kevin can't relax
Yell I'm spinning thoughts with anti gravital force
Shoot the monkey off my porch
And pass myself the torch to light it up

[Bridge]

[Hook]
All around the world, we move it up
And yo we keep things striving
Soo high from heaven to the deep blue sea
All I ever wanted to do
Was show you I had faith in you
But now I help you build your fire
Your so different baby
You always got something to say
But it's more about the things you do
Got me singing yeah eh yeah eh yeah

On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like this, on the microphone like that
On the microphone like
