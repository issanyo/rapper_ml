[Chorus:]
Some days when we fall down
Like its one you to get on up
Some days say when we all fall down get on up

[Verse 1:]
Flies to the minimum gave your ass a laugh
Because a broke a glass and I’m killing them
Think fast are you feeling them
Cause I’m here bob dealing them
Straight lower leading them
Straight leading them into infinitum
You can make a mill and still fall down
Reject city linke Nemo Brown
You like gridding it we go on we go under ground
K-os from the whole from the 426 get down with a
Bitty with a quickness that really gona put me on the hitlist
Uh Ite fall down get up  let them back in the cut
And I make them say what and i didn't say 4321
What we fighting for girl let’s play double dutch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I been here don't forget that
Sometimes when i sit back i can emit that
I’m a master hip rap
So it pisses me off when people be chit chat
Ding but I’m down with the king
I’m the yang of the ying bada boom bada bing
Here’s the thing all your rappers grew up on my music
So I’m gonna have to clap you with a
Microphone then i wrap you
You fall down get up then cheers my cup
Naah me I’m bossing up
K that’s your ass sold by the pound
The rap dad that brought you up son

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
When you fall up you fall down
The sky's the ground
You make that sound fool around
And do the town
When you fall up you fall down
The sky's the ground
You make that sound fool around
And do the town

[Chorus]
