I know there’s something going on
There’s something going on
I know there’s something going on
There’s something going on
It’s been a long time now coming
100 miles and running
We stun it and burning microphone
Oh yes I know we running
We winning, spinning, grinning
Oh yes can’t tell it’s nothing
It’s so magnificent like Sunday
They say man makes money
Money never made the man
But, God made the woman so maybe I understand
That he needs grands in his hands
And a fresh pair of sneakers
That’s why my kicks are busted
I live my life through the speaker box
I know there’s something going on
There’s something going on
I know there’s something going on
There’s something going on
Oh, you’re standing too close to me now
There’s so much I cheat from you now
You’re standing too close to me now
What am I supposed to do
Back from Polaris, to Paris, to Northern Lights
Real life is what you make it
So let’s make something fly
Get up on it when I saw your page grew 7 sonnets
Your method is too bionic
It’s driving me super sonic
Like back in the day when a baby boy
Had a microphone, a boom box, no toys
Break them kicks got time to shine
Pick em up in a pan and rope em up like it’s fine
Like a to the b to the c to the d e f r e s fresh I geuss
Top of the world singing them songs ’cause something’s going on
I know there’s something going on
There’s something going on
I know there’s something going on There’s something going on
