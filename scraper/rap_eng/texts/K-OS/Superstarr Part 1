Ending is coming and fast is soon
I don't need your pain and adversity
Rising like the sun in the highest noon
I don't want to lose the ability

Look at how they coming and they hang me high
Leave me out here, hang me out to dry
Standing on the side like some parasites
Waiting on their turn to eat

And in this game of destiny
Every man is asking, "Why?"
Or how they want to govern me
I couldn't let them if they tried

And in my deepest, darkest side
He was there to ease the pain
So I give up all my pie
Just to glorify his name

Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are

And it doesn't last
When you turn the sand into glass
They can steal the sun, out of the sky
Reach for a star, never too high

Don't shoot me down
Not that you would
And don't pass me by
I'm not your fool

Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are

Tell me how did you get so low?
When you know you're a superstar
If there's pain, then just let it go
Don't forget that you know who you are
