Girl in the café
You wore all the jewels
Only Nature coult think of
Girl in the café
You really pushed me to the brink of pain
To see such beauty
A pair of eyes just like a flash of light
I lost you
But I defrost you
From my memory´s freezer
Every night
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´ve still got no clue about you
Girl in the café
All those tears are drying
I´m not denying
Girl in the café
The magic´s gone
And there´s no more crying
For you and your ivory skin
With Sister Midnight gasping within
All the icons
The zodiac signs
Have failed to help you
To get me to sin
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´ve still got no clue about you
Girl in the café
Inside of me a bomb exploded
My heart was loaded
Girl in the café
You conquered me
And I want you to know it
A war was waging in me
To last awhile
Centuries maybe
Or else
I might forget
Your eyes that were
Glowing so sad
No you weren´t the love of my life
But I´m still missing you
No you weren´t the love of my life
And I´ve still got no clue all about you
