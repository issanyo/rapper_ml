(Now dance fast! this is what we do overall in this century!)

I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges
We don't need no water, let it burn to the ground
Some might fear, some of them are superstitious
But my ear is to the ground and I walk the streets downtown

It's just the same ol' story
It's such a different story
It's just the same ol' story
It's for the game..

When I was a young boy
I always seemed to care what they thought about me
But now I'm all grown up and I make my own choice
I will be standing tall, dropping down on my feet

I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges
We don't need no water, let it burn to the ground
Some might fear, some of them are superstitious
But my ear is to the ground cuz I walk the streets downtown
Downtown, downtown

Downtownâ€¦
Where ever the crown, it's downtown
Turn on the light
Cuz your left hand knows what you're doing with your right
And when the right hand glows, left is jealous of the light
So you put them both together and you clap for your life
Time, that's why I'm back in the building
Convert the flame the faith that I was building
Get off the bridge all the women and children
Fire code, sheep in wolf's clothes

I don't really care that I'm burning some bridges
We don't need no water, let it burn to the ground
Some might fear, some of them are superstitious
But my ear is to the ground cuz I walk the streets downtown
Downtown, downtown

Who would think that you would be the one to bring this on
Who would think that you would be the one to break my heart
I don't care what they say
You're my girl anyway
If the truth sets your free
What's the use if you're not for me?

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh ooh
