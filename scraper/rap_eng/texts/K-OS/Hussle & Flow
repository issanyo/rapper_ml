[Verse 1:]
Freak freak ya’ll
I’m back in the streets ya’ll
I’m having a total recall
I’m trying to reach ya’ll
Why they poppin shots at ching chong
That's why my nickname is street ball
Oh praise the most high
Dop pa do pa do the chicken don’t fly
I’m the one that floats the boat so don’t try
Throw you in the trash like waffles and fries right
Yo put in a minimum say I’m setting up
Subliminal criminal messages spiritual vestiges
Yes this is the best their is was there ever was
Was wizard of auz mo like Kraimer
Set her free never never contain her
Cause my lifestyle like when
We out here looking for the same girl
Brain drill on the same bill looking damn still
That's what you get drilled when the pain kills

[Chorus:]
Mama say mama say don't go too far
But it's way too late cause I’m in the car
Heading down the load with a loaded mike
And i shoot at anything on God damn sight
I let the haters go so see you later yo [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Go ladies go ladies [x4]
Go
The picker picker upper
The beat chopper
The freak down between the sheets
The music popa the freak topper
The real beat dropper
The beat knocker the street heat top shotter
Hand on the palm left hand on the 45
Never taking a dab staying alive
La la la la la la la la la
Never say die cause I’m never going to slide don't try
Hustle and flow plus i hustle and doe
I can bust a van of vandro
Yea Canada is where we land
If you don’t call me don’t go
Everyone know Canada yes without no
Canada stop without go
Canada to it out low
Can't have the rap game without lee Jackson
Don't know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Connections to perfection 	directing your perception
Ha ha ha my diction prediction intellection
You like mixing ha ha ha ha
Life is like but don't like this one
Don't try this on son your time is done
If the trigger don't clap never you
Never use that we filling the gaps
It's all the same another game
And i am not wasting my time
If it's all for fame then what a shame
You soon be losing your mind
Losing your mind

[Chorus:]
Mama say mama say don't go too far
Don't go too far
Down the road
Don't go too far
Mama say mama say don't go too far
Don't go too far
Down the road
Mama say mama say don't go too far
But it's way too late cause I’m in the car
Heading down the load with a loaded mike
And i shoot at anything on God damn sight
