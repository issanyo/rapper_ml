[Intro:]
I feel sudden urge to sing
The kind of diddy that invoke the spring
So control your desire to curse
While i crucify the verse

[Hook]
I crucify the verse [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Well it's the top dog underdog
Making MC’s stop dog
They bump their gums but they end up being locked jaw
This world is not yours since i was 7 years old
Your jelly beans will trap lords and wack toys
But I’m back ya’ll to smack up and fracture
The actors who lacked the real raw talent
And in fact ya’ll it's like that ya’ll
I have the mike and you never get it back no
And even though it's still gimy
The lights are brilliant and blinding
They try to play us like buck wee and tiny
But they can't crucify me cause my style
Is like a mystery history shows
Magician reposes the crap that those
Who makes doe pressing status that is old
Oodles of old oodles of old
Noodles and tou food
It’s so true my tongue kung fu will punk you
And tump you you punk crew you done dude

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yow this is a stick up stick up
When i Pick up Pick up
Microphone dem rappers lick up lick up
Like a plate of hot bricks
A stock tip these entertainer with pop hit
On rocket will fall back to earth like the natholum
I’m chin checking them seconds am docking them
Scolding rexing and faxing them vaxing them
Straight disrespecting hackling  jeckling lex lutering them
Disassembling the gremblings
I’m filling up on a lot of reality
Every where i represent the transity
The double edge bager rapper
Singer slang Peter I’m so deranged in it
So yes i bring the danger
I’m not a pagan not poking vegetarian
Who brings the beacon home
And eats them see’s like Cole Steigen
Make no mistaking I’m not Ronald Reagan
I’m more like Karl Steigen
With Zacaria stick in the faking
