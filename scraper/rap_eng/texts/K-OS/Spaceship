[Intro]
Like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky

[Verse 1]
Uh, stare out my window
Already know where I been though
They say life's like a stencil
At twelve years old I rock with a number two pencil
My mom used to say "get your head out the sky"
Such a small fry, they didn't want me to fly
But I never cry, I just took a step
Peace to Josh, peace to Droops, less we forget
Yo, slanging raps on the block, just to lick a shot
Other rappers aren't hot, just forget it
Right down to the bell before class
Every other one dimension emcee wouldn't last
Mister Stally, where's my demo?
He said to let you know, let the truth be your ammo
Yep, another song to sing
And they soon come back bringing the dawn they bring
But...

[Hook]
People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

[Verse 2]
Yo, it visits one time, there's only one line so you better be on time
Sifted the black in the back with the track
You could cruise in the Cadillac 'til they put the zap on 'em
You're not a friend to the end, you only come around when love is a trend
It's a spaceship, not a slave ship
And until your eyes spent so many wasted
Nights in a hotel, go tell it on the mountain
Oh yeah, mansion in public housing
It's a different kind of bouncing, from a distant star
But you all meet me at the bar

[Hook]
People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie

[Verse 3]
This is not speak and spell but I ring the bell
You could tell that it's astro-Johnny Cash flow in an Astro van
Kicking rhymes in the back to our final destination but it's not on the map
You attack, but it's a little known fact that I'd rather shoot stardust when it's on tap
This is dealing bigger claiming love at first glance, so think about a quote in advance, dance

[Instrumental Bridge: 8 measures]
No lie

[Hook]
People think I'm crazy for thinking so high
I let the world amaze me, and I'm a lonely guy
But I'mma learn to fly, like a spaceship from the sky
Like a spaceship from the sky, no lie
