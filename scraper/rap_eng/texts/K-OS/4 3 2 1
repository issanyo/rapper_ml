[Chorus]
4 3 2 1
What we're fighting for 3 2 1
I don't know what for 3 2 1
What were fighting for 3 2 1
I don't know what for, for, for

[Hook]
Clap your hands everybody
Don't act like you never saw me
Just clap your hands everybody
And everybody clap your hands
(2x)

[Verse 1]
You say hello, I say goodbye
Don't leave me high or Molson Dry
Feels so good when you're by my side
Check my Johnny Depp, playin' the role of a fly guy, whatever
I thought together, we're tougher than leather
And never pull put the pleasure under pressure
But it seems all that glitters is gold
Baby you sold your soul for the golden goose
But the truth is as long as I keep rhyming
Eyes keep shining soul stays divine
I remember '96 we used to dance
I had two pairs of pants, but you had that glance
Yo, we used to hang out in the park and just chill
Now we swing swords in the dark and act ill
Doesn't really matter, I got to go
Peace to Maestro, Zebb Rock fo' sho we did it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Guess who's back but never left it all
With a brand new pencil and a crystal ball
Let it fall
Summertime break down the wall
You can't give what you have not received at all
It's the truth
Full proof, but fools need proof
So I slide to the side and I act uncouth
But its just an act, cause I might react
To those who never held a mic that fed back
Listen its just a day in the life
Of a man living in the dark one headlight
Big up to Dillon, the village makes the villain
I write raps well I watch myself on the ceiling
4 3 2 1, it's a countdown
I roll like a laser beam through the downtown
It's mind over matter, maintain the glow
Peace to Metric, LJ (era) ooh..

[Chorus]
