[Hook: Kaye Allen]
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
They said they all know, what they doing
So I'm gonna sit back and let 'em, let them shorties rock

[Verse 1: K-os]
She know how to work it-wait a minute, wrong lyrics
Both really don't want a relationship
She just want somebody she can hold it down with
Not easy, always plays hard to get
She doesn't want kids, even had to plea the fifth
She's a lady in the public but a thug when it's needed
Looks like a good girl, looks are deceiving
Crazy how perfection is something you possess
Slaying everybody even if your hair's a mess
They always tryna study, things you want the most
Not tryna boast but can y'all pass every test
Walk in with swag, new Gucci bag
Keep in the house, [?] beat out her chest
Phone in your hand, I'll be your man
Always turnt up now the volume needs rest
Everyone's jealous but you're overzealous
Cept the fact that you realize haters progress
Maybe you should come thru, just me and you
So I can relieve you of all your stress

[Hook: Kaye Allen]
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
They said they all know, what they doing
So I'm gonna sit back and let 'em, let them shorties rock

[Verse 2: J-$mooth]
She know how to work it
How you do that perfect?
Got me surprised like whoa, whoa, wait
Stop for a minute while I'm throwin' this cash
Got me lookin' slow-mo why you movin' so fast?
She work that body, she tighten them abs
You know how I mess with that
To handle that, come over here with your wraps
Baby it's tighter than glad
How you be lookin' so bad
I bring the cash, she wanted a piece of that ($mooth, uh)
She said, $mooth, I love the way you move
Let me holla at you, with you all day
You're like a Pikachu, because I choose you
Back to basics with you, you

[Hook: Kaye Allen]
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
They said they all know, what they doing
So I'm gonna sit back and let 'em, let them shorties rock

[Verse 3: Kaye Allen]
Shorty on the dance floor, she be doing work
Give her all this cash cause she beggin' like a clerk
I be sittin' back watching real close
Swear I got them all lined up in rows, uh-huh
And I know they love it cause when I show up they show it
They be talkin' how I got this party lit, uh-huh
All the shorties with me they be screaming, "that's okay"
Cause they all know how I play, uh-huh
You can't help yourself, the way baby work
Lookin' at her make me go berserk
Like Beyonce she flawless
Damn she make my mind go thoughtless

[Hook: Kaye Allen]
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
They said they all know, what they doing
So I'm gonna sit back and let 'em, let them shorties rock
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
They said they all know, what they doing
So I'm gonna sit back and let 'em, let them shorties rock
She said she knows, what she doing
So I'm gonna let her, I'ma let her, let shorty rock
