[Hook: KOS]
It's just another battle cry
Glory for the moment
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh
I'll take you on another high
Cause I can't undo this
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh

[Verse 1: Tre Mission]
Young king from the Milly with the gun sling
Girls love drugs if I never knew one thing
If I knew another one, sex could be drugs
Two, mix it with greed, it would lead you to one thing
Young thing back in the day named Jess
I can still remember the day they met
We were doing one scam with a payday check
"What's good for the day?" is what AJ said
When he walked up to it, that was my nigga
She said "nothing but I'm tryna get high, nigga"
He said "Tre, roll a spliff, yeah, I know the friend's beat
But you'll take it for the team if you're my nigga"
And he was right, so I'm breaking up the rest
Give the 20 we were saving for the rest of the Henney
School same day and the class coming up
But I was 16, I was cool, same way, you get me, dawgy?
And she gave the pussy to him same day, that's nuts
Young kids full of hormones, that's us
25 darn mills, she was on that bus
He was slipping with the slew and the store, that sucks
But I told them already, [?] you wrong
You should know me already, something doesn't add up
She was coming from school when we met her that's fucked
Cause she never had a bag but she had her hands tucked
So he couldn't see whatever she was hiding
He told me that that could've been whatever she was riding
When it came down to it, niggas ain't down for you
So they save rounds for you just in case they got a flight note
Saying "I'mma stick to my new girl"
Fuck hood life, now I'm in a new world
Still tipping it down but I'm nipping it down in a new place
Welcome to the screwface, feeling like a new world

[Hook: KOS]
It's just another battle cry
Glory for the moment
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh
I'll take you on another high
Cause I can't undo this
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh
It's just another battle cry
Glory for the moment
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh
I'll take you on another high
Cause I can't undo this
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh

[Verse 2: Tre Mission]
New day in the city with a few names
New chain with the same face but a new name
Crew changed, he don't even hit me up, too shame
Rolling with a clique full of snakes with a loose dame
But who came when it all fell apart?
Saying how he knew she was gone from the start
He was talking 'bout the trap like it wasn't for the honey
Telling niggas 'bout the pussy, he was all for the charge
It was all for the lux, though
That's what he told me as he draw for the blunt smoke
Even though you know me, you don't know stress
Cause you don't know Jess, she was awful and cutthroat
Imagine when I had work, she was getting off cocks
Just piece by piece to a nigga on block
And now I'm here thinking that they only sell weed
But when I make moves, he's chipping off rocks
Get me, dawgy? You remember when I met her on the first day?
Why the fuck was she there in the first place?
Turns out that the friend had to drag her to the clinic
She was giving out pussy on the first date
Yeah, I should've known but I knew I could have boned
So it all creeped up on a nigga in the worst way
I guess life's fucked up when your wife's fucked up
Going to the same clinic this Thursday

Everybody in the house say oh
I'll take you on another high
Cause I can't undo this
And if we get another life
Everybody in the house say oh
