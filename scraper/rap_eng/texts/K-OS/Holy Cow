[Ron Burgundy]
Great odin's raven!
Oh, by the hammer of Thor
By Saint Damian's beard!
Sweet grandmother's spatula!
Riff-raff!"

[k-os]
So it came down
Making the same sound
In the early morning time
And I know why
And it came down
Making the same sound
In the early morning time
So play it loud, girl

[Chorus]
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Holy cow
Holy cow

Uh
To the beat y'all
To the...
Yo

Back from the high school block
Back when {Cory Penny?} was hot
Now I'm not saying she's not
I'm just saying I don't care
Whether they love, or love me not
New Plot
If life's a game I reckon
The price of fame
Divided by the evil we do
Equals the shame
Of a rock star daughter with a lazy eye
So if you can't tread water
Don't take a dive
But i survived
Kept it live
From 95
Crowd surfing, looking for work and
Christopher Walken down the street
Bobbin' to the beat
Still standing on my two feet
Yo, I can't believe it
Holy cow

[Chorus]
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Holy cow
Holy cow

Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

I used to make my ball cap match my running shoes
I used to crack a smile when I really had the blues
I used to think everyone in town heard the news
When I was neurotic
Just was watching my p's and q's
But now I'm grown up and
I'm still a little kid
I sleep with my mic and
I wake up in my crib
To that girl that tried to play me
I'm Adam, take a rib
I'll kick it to your friend
Before you make me flip my lid, holy cow

So it came down
Making the same sound
In the early morning time
And I know why
And it came down
Making the same sound
In the early morning time
So play it loud, girl

[Chorus]
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Well, holy cow
I was lifted from the wreckage
Easy, I have it easy
Holy cow
Holy cow
