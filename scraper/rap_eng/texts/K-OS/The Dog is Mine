Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
Dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine

You know, you know that you gotta go
So go, I thought you don't pack a soul
I tried, I tried to empathize
But white lies, a dog gotta be a prize

And now the sun is setting well
We got to let it go
We were too deaf for wedding bells
And too naïve to know

Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine

Go ahead, go ahead with your better self
We'll go in love with somebody else
Sometimes it's better to live in sin
Than in love when you don't want someone to win

And now the sun is setting well (setting well)
We got to let it go (let it go)
We were too deaf for wedding bells (wedding bells)
And too naïve to know

Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine

Malibu, Prius drive
Who took who for a ride
Wild fox, black boots
More shots, half truths
Easy come, easy go
Yoga mat, Yoda flow
Canyon road, Hayden's house
Turn me up, fake me out
Birthdays, little word
Spare keys, insert
Argument, ecstasy
Don't stand so next to me
Computer screens, swallow us
Look at all my followers
Everybody get down, I'm taking over

Got to pack my
Things and go
Move fast not slow
The dog is mine
Oh you got to pack your
Things and go
Move fast not slow
That dog is mine
