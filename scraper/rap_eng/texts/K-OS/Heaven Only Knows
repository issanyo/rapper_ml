[Intro]
Turn this up
Turn this up
Uh huh
No beat
Uh huh
No No No Beat
Uh huh uh huh

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows (uh uh)
Cuz I don't understand (Understand)
Won't you tell me please (Tell me please)
Whats the master plan (Master plan)
Spent so many days (many days)
Sitting on a cloud (sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (only god knows)
So I'll just move the crowd

[Break]
Yo tell em
Tell em
Now
Now
Now

[Verse 1]
I break out my physical shell
And excel past the so called body
Used to go to the party
But now I sit and chill with the pen and the pad
Dropping ill philisophical science
Me and my dad we talk about life
And how it started
How we departed from lights path
And probable right math
The task at hand is making people understand that we're not who we think we are
Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high
People be getting high wondering why we die
But it's all planned
To get your fear take the hand
We keep on returning because the lessons need learning
Concerning the fact
I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analize
I energise with cosmic rays of days
There ain't no ??? ??? of the sun

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows
Cuz I don't understand (Don't undertand)
Won't you tell me please (Cuz I pray every day)
Whats the master plan (The master plan)
Spent so many days (Many days)
Sitting on a cloud (Sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (Only god knows)
So I'll just move the crowd

[Break 2]
Yo
Riddle me this
Riddle me this
Like this

[Verse 2]
Melodical prodigal flows
Hypnotical blows to brain pieces
Telekenisis
When I reach this pinnacle cynical clinical
Microphone autobots waiting on lotto spots
Trying to rock
But yo they can't understand
There's only one plan
The time is at hand
In the year two zero one one
The people of the sun return to free the righteous children
Now! I know you want to be on top of the world
Giving a diamond and pearl to your girl watching your jacuzi swirl
Seems like material lust
We need to look up to the heavens for imperial trust
Me!, it's kinda hard when you rhyme sometimes
Everybody wants to scrutinize
Redifine who you are
But every person is a star
So let your light shine far
And praise god

[Chorus]
Heaven only knows (Only knows)
Cuz I don't understand (Don't understand now)
Won't you tell me please (Tell me please)
Whats the master plan (I wanna know the plan)
Spent so many days (Many days)
Sitting on a cloud (Sitting on a cloud)
Heaven only knows (So I'll just move the crowd)

If you feel this
Sing it with me like
Sing it with me like
Sing it with me like

La la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now

Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd
Gotta move the crowd

La la la lala lala
I'll just move the crowd for now

Somebody told me
They said uh

If you free them (uh huh)
They will start revolution and babylon cannot defeat them
(right
And they don't want that
And they don't want that
And they don't want that)
If you free them
They will start revolution and babylon cannot defeat them
(mind revolution
Mind revolution)
