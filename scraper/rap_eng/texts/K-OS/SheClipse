[Ron Burgundy]
"This is a tough decision
So much to think about
Basically the biggest story of my career
Launching me to a level i've never known before
Or saving the woman i used to have familiar relations with
This is hard
Come on!
It's me poppa burgundy alright
Let the games begin
There he is
There he is
I'm very aroused"

[k-os]
Uh
Ok
Ok i get it
Check it out

Self esteem don't approve of the cream
Thats why i can had to throw the verse in the latrine
The bathroom and the chicks in the toilet seat
I don't sip coke when i'm on a magazine
On a cover of another mega team dream team
Alien crystal clean
Yo don't procrastinate
Just eradicate
The fate the judge you hate
From the gate
I'm biologically engineered to treat the speaker
All of no fear
Throw your fan of the man
And your hands in the air
While you think of a thought to be clear

[Chorus]
Oh!
So if you think your a star
So girl come out tonight
If you stay at home in the dark
You'll just lose your sight
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes out
Everybody loves the sun

When the sun comes out
You living like a lick a shot
I'm not a have i'm not a have not
I'm more like astronaut
More like Metallica hip hop
Microphone mascot
Living int he dark
Tin man searching for a heart
Looking for the wizard of oz
If everybody up in here is a star
Then who's planet earth for the cause yo
Dozey do
Mosy-fo
To blow up the whole freak show and go
Back to the drawing board
I don't know why stay america rap when she's never home
But wait i think i hear a knock at the door
Think about the freak on the floor
Or
16 12 24
Can't pretend i'm in not in love anymore

[Chorus]
Oh!
So if you think your a star
So girl come out tonight
If you stay at home in the dark
You'll just lose you sight
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes up
When the sun comes out
Everybody loves the sun

Oh
Oh oh oh
Oh [x4]
