[Verse:]
I use to wear kendalls in the bag pack
Its' k-dash and I’m bringing rap back
I’m on your mind like a skully or a snap back
And I’m eatin MC’s like a handful of cracker jacks
Yea can't have the four foogie
I once had a fetish fetish for some bootie
A girl up in West Hollywood she never use to do me
Polished my furniture as if she never knew me
Like big boy and Andre I'm yeezus like Kanye
I’m pisuperious your rapper rampaa
Mos Def like Dante my rhymes can't be repeated
So call me style Beyonce
You catch it I’m ready
MC’c needs to get stepping
In fact I’m here to teach rappers a lesson
Peace to brother question
Black fathers on carter so I’m darker than
The resident in your road spill
Stray happy my mother is Jack k
A ghetto classic
Peace to hurricane wonder classic
Might make you head flip like lady gymnastics to
The wall like spider man
I’m lighter man than the other man
Hey dash I’m your brother man
That's how we free style
Until 3am do it again and
Go tell a friend and so on and so on
Two thousand buddhas the flow
The flow on the low on like
Man lazer I’m shooting
My full tart I’m the kid his girlfriend ha
