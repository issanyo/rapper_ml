[Hook 1: Saukrates]
My mama said don't say nigga
The world said, pull the trigger
I'm sitting here trippin' off of old liquor
And now I'm insistin' on a old  rhythm
I'ma doorite, I can do wrong
I'ma doorite, I can do wrong, wrong

[Verse 1: Saukrates]
I got just all the glamour the lights
The flames and rockets
You couldn't imagine all the days that I flip
From hero to zero
Flip shit backwards zero to hero
Rebirth the access
Now show your money
But never show emotion
Two little phrases sound like a pimp's potion
I'ma play the game like a whale play the ocean
Even if it mean the money move in slow motion
I ain't saying nothin' but the real
Flip the coin this a joint I say how I feel
The peaks and valley define the alley cat
Hope you rally back
The wifebeater
Barely cuts in Louie sneakers
Seventh series Beamer
Shallow chicks start your Benz
And said OMG I guess it did better treat her
The infinite pursuit I hope
When you show true colors you were happy too
Do it, do it

[Hook 2: Saukrates]
My mama said don't say nigga
The world said, pull the trigger
I'm sitting here trippin' off of old liquor
And I'm insistin' on a old rhythm
I'ma doorite, I can do wrong
I'ma doorite, I can do wrong
I'ma doorite, I can do wrong, wrong
Yeah I can do wrong, wrong

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I gotcha
And I give you every piece of me
I hit the booth and bear it all with no decency
Mama wishing that I was more of a Jesus freak
I just hope I'm good with this good wood Jesus peace
Been away from my spiritual lessons
I pray these tattoos of crosses can get me into heaven
Sold some weed to the son of the reverend
Had his daughter up in the club
Swallowing all our blessings
Guzzle down a shot
Take it down a notch
Car sick like the cooties I circle circle round the block
East Coast wish wash
Tell me if you down or not
You take me for granted
Funny that’s how I got my counter tops
Nigga I'm from that rich city slip
Where they huntin' down lottery winners to catch a lick
Where the young girls mess with old men and get corrupted
Where if you carry on they chop and stuff you in luggage
I love it

[Hook 2]

[Verse 3: K-os]
Mine she hold ya, she hot krazy glue
She's got weapons of mass destruction
Tucked in two places
Two faces
Can give birth to all races
My homeostasis is faceless when I ace this
I'm not a racist but still it's a race
From the sperm to the egg
From the time your daddy busted his third leg
It's like gold to the uterus
Move get out the way
Throwin' them bones just like Ludacris
I wanna be new to this world
I wanna doorite
I wanna new bike
My first Pumas that came in white
I wanna do wrong tonight
But she sleeps by the light of the silvery moon
So tight
She magnetizes my Michael Jackson
My inner fraction or my [?] actions
Limits or subtraction action packin'
Admits the plastic tracks
I'm back
I was born to rap
That's why I'm ——
