[Intro:]
West Coast, East Coast, this is illegal dose
East Coast, West Coast, the real legit cause
Blast off, whacko, field run, here we go yea

[Verse 1:]
Got CCC with a bit of bell
Re-p-p-peat when I be the man
Backward three coupe when I'm in the
No cute chick think that I'm in a plus
That week coke coke when I'm in the bus
Got CCQ with coke with an over cue
But chika bobba bombin with us
Back with the info, it took you hook line sink her low
All these verses sound so slow
Rappers, let my people go
Hocus-pocus make it last
Rock emcees and I take the stash
Watch us face, innovate 'em, take 'em
Let's move this fast
Crown watching, flopping, plotting
Hope raise in stocking
This game ain't saying nothing, hip-hopping is Jeffrey Dahmer
So down Dummings, on dillage, no longer slumming
But I've been bombin' since Sunday mornin' ha
The coming

[Chorus:]
You thought that you would have it easy
You weren't even supposed to see me
But now you've got me wild for the night
This thing is out of sight
It wasn't even supposed to happen
You acted as you were assassin
So now you've got me wild for the night
This thing is out of sight
Damn it right

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, what's up, Toronto, I'm Johnny Depp
Like Tano, the avaricious man
Pass me the bottle so we can celebrate
This is my motto, that you too can get it like bono frats Soprano
A tenant that sing Mr. Cado like wall in the tenner lotto
You commercialize my style
Took it to down and you drove around a while
But now I want it back with some interest on the plow
Chicken bone me, chicken bone me, chicken went fowl
And did you know, when the verog on my style is vado
Kick 'em, pew the rag, took her back to the coupe
And I made a tag
Watch it boat, lemme make it back, my head so futuristic black
Coffee, soup, gotta oak it, gotta ok dokey it
Dope face, loap face, make it clap
Dr. Chang made a man so funkey, like I forget where it at
Back, woke track, d-track chack
Jack jack time's runnin out, yo time's runnin' out

[Chorus]
