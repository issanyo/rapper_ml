La La Laaaaa
Ba dat da la laaaaa
Revolution so devine
It's taking time it's taking time
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Babylon could never take me

(Alter Ego)
Yes Yes Yes
Feels good
Feels sooooo good to be here
And uh...I'd like to welcome you
Thank you, thank you for this thing
For this thing
And ummm
I know a lot of you are listening to this cd and thinking like
(laughing) you're thinking, what is this guy talking about
I mean, joyful rebellion and thinking and thought and time
And it's like who is this guy?
Well, this guy happens to be me
My name is K-os
Kevin is irrelevant, say it with me now
(repeated screwed) Kevin is irrelevant
Thank you
Ok, now I'm not going to waste alot of time
We've done that already
But the fact is, we're not using our minds the way we should be
(sighs) so sad
But such is life, every man controls his own destiny, or so he thinks
So have you ever wanted to be free? Freedom
Have you ever wanted to be free of your emotions?
No no no no sorry
Have you ever been free of wanting to be free of your emotions?
Riddle me that
Now, K-os or Kevin is in the back over there
His ego's getting uhhhh...
You know I always tell that boy, you drink too much
But he just, he's, I don't know
But he's over there and he want's to get on the mic
And I guess I've already...I've already freaked you out enough
So I guess we'll go back to reality
Or so you think. I'll be back next time

(K-os)
Yow whatever you say man

(alter ego)
Yow Kevin

(K-os)
That's my name
What, What's up?

(alter ego)
Do your thing

(K-os)
Alright check it out
Introduction, microphone holy roller
Remember my mother used to push me up in a stroller
She used to watch Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda
While my pops took apart machines by motorola
I'm bipolar
In grade ten I took granola
Brought it to school and played rugby with Jimmy Stola
I got older and the planet was getting colder
Felt Like Luke Skywalker lost without Yoda, Soul controller
Only black kid in my grade, Rock the fade
No doubt those people didn't know the
Pecking order
So I read books on yoga
Prayed to my heavenly father for him to show the
Way to the yellow brick road the episode
Has got me caught at the dock of the bay
Just like Noah
Now I'm over the fatal suburban coma
Big up Fatsky, Marvel, my man Mocha
Check it out
Lord help me find a way to deal with the pressure
Cause these people just don't know
At times I want to go
Away from here
But life can be a sad song but don't you fear
Or cry cause God is in your eye
Not in the sky
But you don't believe there's a glow
Cause we suffer so
Just cause we tried
