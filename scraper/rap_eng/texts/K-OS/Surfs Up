[Sebastien Grainger]
I've been sleeping with fishes
She's been doing the dishes
Surfs up on the oil spill
There's a black pad now on the water

I've been inside of dreams on the seaside
Your friend is the enemy
Nothing is heavy

[Chorus]
C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater
(to the blackwater)
[x2]

[k-os]
Phenomenon, trying to keep my dreams on
You can do your dance on
Now that you got your drink on
Ain't no thing
In my game
Baby hold on
Told you once before
More than love song

[Sebastien Grainger & k-os]
I can you be your Houdini
And bring you magic
I think whats happening
Here is tragic
Just let me through the door
Let beat your habits

[k-os]
Singing songs until we are dead and gone

[Chorus]
C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater
(to the blackwater)
[x4]

[k-os]
Oil that is.. black gold
Uh uh
I'm price is the water
The fish diggy black black
They slaughter inside the order
And care take that back back
Black purge in the sky flying black facts
I feel like a fireman
I wanna swing axe axe
They let go Wall Street
Gordon Gecko
From the get-go
They escrow echoes
Shooting electrodes
Magnetics and weed
Angels like techno

[Sebastien Grainger]
I've been inside of dreams on the seaside
Your friend is the enemy
Nothing is heavy

[Chorus]
C'mon c'mon let's slip out tonight
To the blackwater
(to the blackwater)
[x4]
