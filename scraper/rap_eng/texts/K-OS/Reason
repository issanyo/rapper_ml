VERSE 2 [K-OS]:
Yeah
Coolin’ when it's hot outside
Top goes down with our hands up high
They won't know what we do
Baby it's me and you
Beamer or Benz, you choose
We work hard every day
It's time we take a break
You need to breathe
Learn to be stress free
That's a chance that we'll take
I look into your eyes
And assure that it's okay
Pack your bags, take my hand, and we'll go far away
Everybody wants to be like us
We're their role models when it comes to havin’ trust
All these girls never understand
What it's like to have a man
Who would feel much more than just lust
This generation doesn't realize
That everything can be real
You and I more than real
More than just sex appeal
Hatred's never classified as a discussion
But the funny part about it is that there was no production
All these haters mean nothing
We're really gonna make it far
If we have a son
You'll still be my only star
Keep it PG is all we heard when we were kids
It developed into the way that we mainly lived
But then we had begun to just realize
That we have our lives, together
Through the stormiest weather
There's other relationships but ours is much better...and now it's quiet for them

HOOK [KAYE ALLEN]:
You love me down, down town
Where the city is just right enough for you and me

That you counting up Bens with me baby

Hands up, us now

I want to hit this all on you
[Gotta get real with it, gotta get real with it oh]
