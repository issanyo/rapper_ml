[Intro: K-OS]
Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Word up!

[Hook: K-OS]
I make a call but you're not there
I fly a ship into outer space, there
Up to me, but there's nothing to say
I forgot how to pray now
And if the sun falls out the sky
And all the truth you know, turn lies
Up to you, but there's nothing to say (to say)
You forgot how to pray now

[Verse 1: K-OS]
Check it out
You've read every book on your shelf
You know every single word by heart
But it does no good
Cause the world's so cold
The world's so cold
And when the morning comes
It's just so hard to get out of bed
Because this world don't know how deep you go
But something's calling you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: K-OS]
Oh we back slide
Hard to believe how we left this ride
Used to believe in the man in the sky
Now we believe in the plan in our eye
Besides, if we tried to pray
Who would be listening anyway
Tried to get down
To the sounds of my youth
No [?] so now I'm out

[Bridge: K-OS]
If you can't dance in the car
You can't dance at all
They can take you far
Make you into a star
Get in your car
But heaven calls
Dance in your car
Or you can't dance at all

[Hook]
