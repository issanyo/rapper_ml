Uh, its like a brand new thing
Switch off the auto-tune toes toward this red thing
She told me to come hang at the dock of the bay
I said no way I'd rather kick it with Graham and Jane
See now you're lost in the plot
We're not, we're just true black diamond hearts
You put us on the cover to cover back to back
Sun doesn't shine
Its still a funk pop marshall ahh

I'm not from the ghetto
But my mama is and she's an uptown girl
I know it's hard to let it go
But you gotta stay up when you're down

Another world, another town
Another letdown
It's all the same
Oh it's insane
And there's no one to blame

Connect the dots omit the Gobots
Hotels, new towns takin' up whole blocks
Taxi, take me to the jam of the year
Get there everybody stop and stare
At the disco ball won't miss my call to rock
Fistful of dots and a new boom box
Bangin, slangin, a capellas to sellas
Don't be jealous, what if all we say is embellished?
Yo it's an uptown world
Electric slide to the side of your mind
Hey to her to me it's all the same
No man's land is how I'm playin the game
I think I lost my mind to a backseat driver in a cab by the moonlight side
Uptown
Make a move uptown
Uptown
Make a move uptown

I'm not from the ghetto
But my mama is and she's an uptown girl
I know it's hard to let it go
But you gotta stay up when you're down

Can't stop this boat from sinking
To new depth's that I hope we never see again
Can't stop this boat from sinking
To new depth's that I hope we never see again

I'm not from the ghetto
But my mama is and she's an uptown girl
I know it's hard to let it go
But you gotta stay up when you're down

Another world, another town
Another letdown
It's all the same
(Oh it's insane)
It's always the same
And there's no one to blame

Another world, another town
Another letdown
It's all the same
(Oh it's insane)
It's always the same
And there's no one to blame

Can't stop this boat from sinking
To new depth's that I hope we never see again
Can't stop this boat from sinking
To new depth's that I hope we never see again
