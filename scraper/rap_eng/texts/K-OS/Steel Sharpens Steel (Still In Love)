[Verse 1:]
I got a new car i got a new cheque
I got my mind up i got a new way
I got a wagon that you can jump on
Every single day and you can rock on
Then when i rock on see me on the block now
Cause we about to do another hot one
One thing you never do is stop now
No hesitating let's get up and go
Too much fantasy not in touch with reality
Too much fantasy I’m not in touch with reality

[Chorus:]
I am still in love with you
For always
And then pretend to not be
Is just to get people play
Still shopping still

[Verse 2:]
I got a new house i got a raise
I gotta move on i gotta move fast
I got a blanket that you can ride on
But come on baby you gotta stop sleeping with the light on
And when it's right now i'm singing all the time now
Coming down the avenue and about to go now
One thing you never do is stop now
No hesitation now just get up and  go
Too much fantasy not in touch with reality
Too much fantasy I’m not in touch with reality

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
And then when the heat is on
I’ll be there by your side
And baby girl when the heat is gone
Have no fear
What's wrong is right
