[Ron Burgundy]
"Do you really wanna know what love is?
Yes, tell us
More than anything in the world Ron
Well its really quite simple
Its kinda like.."

[k-os]
Gotta cut it loose
Cuz it's summer time

Cut it loose
No excuse
It's high noon
You've been in the tomb
In the dark
With the broom
Witch-craft
See the past
It's just your future first draft
Get class
And then get crass
What?
Been in the cut
So deep
I ionize the sheep
Gunshot
Yo Pete!
You gonna do the same thing you done before
Free for more
And snoop around your front door

[Chorus]
Hey…
Wwhat up y'all?

I gotta cut it loose
Cuz it's summer time
[x2]

[k-os]
Oh, quit the job for sho'
Let the wind blow take you where you wanna go
Wherever i lay my hat that's my home
Crazy dreams on
Laser beams on
Black man with the permanent tan
Mic in my hand
I spend a hundred grand on a bottle of wine
But it didn't make me blind
I still see the signs and
Rays of sunshine

[Chorus]
Hey…
Wwhat up y'all?

I gotta cut it loose
Cuz it's summer time
[x2]
