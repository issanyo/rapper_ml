[Chorus:]
Just turn me loose I’m ballin out
And you and my fans are like baby
I’m here to say get out of my way
Or turn me loose

[Verse 1:]
Jesus is coming i hope that she gets here soon
Cause when i saw you blazing
I know you came down here to bring us through time
And i know you are sick and tired of the phoney ones
I’ll be your only source God for higher
The holy mosiah glorifier on liers liers liers

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
When you make money money make money money make
Take your money take money money
When you make money money make money money tale
Take your money take money money
Got to get you in the inspiration of
Gotta get new kicks and then new chicks floor to floor
Gotta keep the title america no matter if you think it's right
Or do you think that it is vital for every desire
When night falls we get serious
Turn her up turn me loose on your stereo
When night falls we get serious
Turn her up turn me loose on your stereo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
All my life I’ve been here waiting
For love to turn me loose
And like to pain to you was painting
Portrait up my face to show
What i have proof that I would never die
I’m ballin out
Turn me loose  I’m doing my thing  like baby
I’m here to say get out of my way
Or turn me loose
Ain't no mountain high ain't no valley low enough
Ain't nothing you can do to
Span from the scope
Cause my mother said just to be yourself
Then you be everybody baby
