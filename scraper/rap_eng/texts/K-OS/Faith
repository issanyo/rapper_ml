[Verse 1: Drake]
Pay attention, its on
Staring at my city lights through the plane window as I write this song
Have faith, when I do it
I’ma do it bigger than they think
I dont just flow I over flow I be filling up the sink
Like I left the water on I run this bitch if anybody ask
Ain't much change since high school
Niggas still be in and out of class
S class or the brand new CL5 on them haters
Black paint, chrome trim same color as the logo for the raiders
I just said that cause I'm out in California in the studio with Tez
You should give us credit niggas killin people we can be all doin that instead..
But we not, we just kill the summer every single time I come around
Never chase hoes but we do we laugh at them niggas tryin to run em down
Not I, not me, YMOB, call jaz, call c
Bet both of them would agree
Get viewed, get judged, get booed, get loved
Shit get done round here, do you, not us

[Hook]
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s made for living
You got to know nothings for sure
Faith in the stars
Im gon do what I want
Cause this life’s what I’m given
Gotta keep my faith in the dark clouds

[K-os]

Once upon a time I met
On this cold explosive dosage she wrote this
But tell me who chose this
Sin city’s innocent really when its inside my mind
And co-sign with a rhyme and a big pen
Once again it’s an even odd
Can’t applaud with one hand
Can’t be God with one fan
Or can you stan you
If not pastor jackson daniels rip that hit that
Now I sip that lightly when I’m on my mic tightly
And I write nightly like Spike Lee
Let me break it down

I been having a maid since the 8th grade with a fade
Rapping by the swings
And the bell never really rings
Class in session there’s no recession
For this upper echelon mic testing its
K-dash-O-S F-R-E-S-H in the place
With a grace in and outta space
Mind that gotta race
Don’t be something that you really not
Sabotage the universal plot
When the planet earth rock gets hot
From the sun don’t get got just get God yeah see that

(Do you believe)
[Hook]
