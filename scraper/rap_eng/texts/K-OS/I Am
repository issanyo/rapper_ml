I feelin' somebody
And I don't need to world
To tell me something
I am waiting for somebody
I can feel it deep in my soul

I'm waiting for somebody
I don't need the world to tell me it's ok
I'm waiting for somebody
I say it's gotta be good
I say
I was all cold
I was in deep

One, I gotta fishing rock
Pull in the spot
Rocking the cop
Getting a ticketin'
Takin' a lickin'
Guilty in the spot
MC

Everybody's callin'
I don't even think
I wouldn't have found out
I didn't mercy go
'very day

Cuz I was home
On thursday
Any day day..

Gotta get used to
I better deserve
Don't blame me for you

I said I..
