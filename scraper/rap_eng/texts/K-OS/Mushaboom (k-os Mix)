[Fiest]
Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been born oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercups oh

But in the meantime we've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

Old dirt road
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
O-o-o-o-old

I got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented house oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's done oh

How many acres, how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

Old dirt road
Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee deep snow
Mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
Mushaboom, mushaboom)
O-o-o-o-old
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
Old dirt road rambling rose
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow
(mushaboom, mushaboom)
Well I'm Sold...

[k-os]
Put on my best suit
Then hit the avenue
Then stroll through the park
Mushaboom in the dark
It's funny how they hate the world when they got no style
I'll tame this rock a dollar bill build a palace on the nile
Until then, I'm walkin' down Bloor with a strut
With fire in my eyes
And fire in my gut
A fire i? boy
From Elroy Asteroid
Rockin microphones from heaven to meccatroid
But wait
Can we take an old dirt road
Erasing foot-steps-on-the-way-to-the-highest-abode
Fo sho
Feist sounds nice, c'est soir
And while we keep finding the light
Je ne sais pas
I don't know
I'm itchin' to go
Itchin' to spit flows
Dissintigrate MC's while keepin' them on their toes
As we flow over at the party
Pogo at the dance? In a b-boy stance
From Mt. Real out to France
She's so smooth when she cruise
Mushaboom
