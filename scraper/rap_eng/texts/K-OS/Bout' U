[Intro]

Didn't they tell you that its all about you (x2)

[First Verse]

Like the sun and the moon
Your my day,your my night
I pray i really see you soon
Maybe we could spend a night
Look I
I got really big plans
I'mma take you on a date
Hope it never ends
We could be them couples
That be always holding hands
Just you and i baby
None of our friends
I got
Love for you and love for me
You got doubt for me now
Now can't you see
We got
Chemistry we're met to be
Its like you
Talking all my energy

[Bridge]
Show me love,show me love,show me love
Pretty little thing she my little white dove
Show me love,show me love,show me love
Pretty little thing came straight from above

[Hook]

In the middle of the night
I be thinking bout u
When the feeling ain't right
I be stressing bout u
Cause my love,my love,my love
She gets down
She drinks too much and than she shuts down
My love,my love,my love
Just slow down
I get
That you
Just tryna have fun
But its never really fun
When you lying in the ground
Cause I'mma be the one to pick you up when you down
Cause i really care I'mma always be the hound
Always in your ear hoping that you come around
Cause my love,my love,my love
She gets down
She drinks too much and than she shuts down
My love,my love,my love
Just slow down
I get that you just tryna have fun

[Second Verse]

Still waitin' on you
I just don't know want to do
And its kinda getting late
Is you still coming through?
So i check on instagram
Saw a couple pictures with you drinking with your friends
Tried to hit you up
But you'll probably press end
Cause every time you drinking this is how it always ends

[Bridge]

I got love for u and love for me
You got
Love for me and Hennessey
You got
Doubt for me now can't you see
It's like your
Hurtin' me intentionally
Show me love,show me love,show me love
Pretty little thing tryna tire herself apart
Show me love,show me love,show me love
Pretty little thing she be breaking up my heart

[Hook]

In the middle of the night
I be thinking bout u
When the feeling ain't right
I be stressing bout u
Cause my love,my love,my love
She gets down
She drinks too much and than she shuts down
My love,my love,my love
Just slow down
I get
That you
Just tryna have fun
But its never really fun
When you lying in the ground
Cause I'mma be the one to pick you up when you down
Cause i really care I'mma always be the hound
Always in your ear hoping that you come around
Cause my love,my love,my love
She gets down
She drinks too much and than she shuts down
My love,my love,my love
Just slow down
I get that you,just wanna have fun

[Third Verse]

Do you think about me when you drinking in the city
Do you really love or you tryna show me pity
I can tell you hurting i can tell thats how you feeling
I just wanna help you
I just wanna see you healing
Cause shoddy you the one
Shoddy you the one
Shoddy you the one (x2)

[Outro]

Why do you wanna see me hurt?
Can't you see lovin' you can hurt?
