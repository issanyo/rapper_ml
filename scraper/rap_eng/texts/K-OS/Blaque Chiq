VERSE 1 [K-OS]

I need some magic, but yo whats the definition
My indecision, bout to take me up on a mission
To the hard concrete and the side walk cracks
My eye pupils black, like outta space, Jack!
Imagine that, Imagine a Life that star maps
Imagine a wife thats real black
Im talking her wigs just real naps
Im talking a bzzn? soul claps
Whh whh let me tell ya where its @

VERSE 2 [MistryKiDD]

O.K K.O its the M to the I
S to the next Letter drop a couple lines
I was bumping black on blonde, and I caught the vibe
I Had to talk about the type, that be chilling to my right
I need me a nubian or she light yeah
I’m talking bout thickness and hair all twisted
And yeah we got chemistry don’t care about physics
And ‘calities and all about the mentality
She don’t gotta weave I need me a girl thats confident in all her abilities
One that feels empowered by all that makes her different
Quote un-quote, yeah she anti ignorant and ain't no ho
So read the sign you illiterate she live on growth
So if you backwards, then my dime girl gotta scratch it
She’s my queen, my light her skin is blackness
Its one of the reasons why she’s so attractive
Concave lens that reflects, where her back is
You can’t touch its virtual and a fact kid
She don’t play, but I swear she could be an actress
