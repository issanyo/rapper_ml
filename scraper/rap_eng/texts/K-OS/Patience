[Intro]
Swing high then swing low
I know we all know
Swing high then swing low
I know

[Verse 1]
I was rushing to the end
But you're everything I saw, again
And hoping to pretend
I was knocking on heavens door my friends
But I was just a fool, caught up in the game
Everything is cool, believing in my name instead of his
And then the sun came out
I couldn't find the shade, I'm not afraid
Of the light anymore

[Chorus]
Patience
Heavens on the side be patient
The universe is wise
Patience
Everything is grand use patience
And you can understand

[Verse 2]
Now everyone knows
We hold the key deep in our souls
But we are living a life on the surface yo
What's the purpose of living lies
Somebody tell me
Some hearts are made of stone (of stone)
They'll find their way back home (home)
I know I walk the path of life eternally
To be free, its all time

[Chorus]
Patience
Heavens on the side be patient (heavens on your side)
The universe is wise (and you know the time will make you wise)
Patience
Everything is grand use patience (use patience)
And you can understand (you can understand)

[Outro]
Swing high then swing low
I know we all know
Swing high then swing low
I know
