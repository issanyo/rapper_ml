[Intro]
(1-2, 1-2-3-4)

[Chorus]
All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it
All they want is to feel it

[Verse 1]
(mumbling)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

[Chorus]
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

[Verse 2]
(mumbling)

[Chorus]
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)
All they want is to feel it
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

[Bridge]
All they want is to feel it

[Verse 3: K-os]
Pull it close, pull it closer, I play it close
Head-to-toes tonight, recognizing the ghost
And the machine getting in between the thought and the finger
At the brink of an evolution, we're going to linger
Come on!
(Oh no! Oh no! oh no!)
(We won't be what you want to be, oh no!)

[Outro]
