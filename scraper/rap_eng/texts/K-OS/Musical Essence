Let's talk about musical essence
Can you feel the presence
Coming from the heavens
Getting mad illy from my bovedic recital
Music is vital
Holy like the bible
Cosmo coming from a whole different galaxy
Hoping I can use my for mental capacity
This is how I rock it for the '94 session
Relieve all your stressin'
Put down your Smith and Wesson
Cuz!

When I'm on the microphone (say what)
I'm bugged out in a hip hop zone (say what)
I don it by my own design (you know it)
Got the funk one time for your mind (check it)

This is the critical script
Cuz I flip
Slip for the butter
This nigga don't stutter
And seldom do I utter
A word that really don't make sense
Forget about the past cuz your in the present tense
And I present down and ill I come down
I'm get busy with the adjectives
Now you know what empathic is
It's kinda funny how mc's exist with no presence (ha ha)
But not me I rock the musical essence

Essence

Essence
Essence
Essence
Essence
Essence

Eh yo
They said I couldn't do it
That I didn't have the skills
Now they got ta eat words like buffalo bills
I catch a wreck like 12 car pileup
Penetrate global states
Like ultraviolet rays
Days and days go on i keep pluggin'
Pop keep beefin'
Ya my ma ya she's buggin'
She said ya you better go to school
Or you'll waste your whole life and you'll end up like a fool
I popped i tape and proceed to bop my head
And disregard every thing that they said
Cuz music is life
Life is not pleasent
If I'm not rolling with the musical essence

Its the essence man
Its the essence yo
We got it going on
Come on sing it
