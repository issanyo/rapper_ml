*appears at the end of "The Ballad of Noah" as a bonus track*

Wake up in the morning, press the Colgate
Brush my teeth, then I'm hitting the streets to meditate
Went outside, and the sky was rather grey
But I paid no attention kept moving upon my way
Went down the block, and skanked a little further
When this kid came up, he said what's up with MC Murdah?
That was then son, this is now
I live in the moment like a why to a how
Wow, that's profound, just break that down
That's when I proceeded to show him the pro to the noun
I found instead of trying to be what I was
I be what I is which makes us the wizard of us
Plus I'm really sick and tired of complaints
Of hip hop this, rap that and what it ain't
I'd rather do a dance, find some romance
Or pray to my father in heaven to get a chance
He glanced down and looked rather disappointed
But then he looked up and looked up and looked ra-rather anointed
He said, "MC Murdah, they wait for the man
And the master of the ceremony that was unplanned"
Damn, you quit pit you know
Plus I grab microphones from here to Gadow
I keep my mind still like the art of tablow
And no matter what they say I go on with the show
We laughed, and gave each other a pound
Exchanged numbers, I said kid see you around
Continued with my stroll for that lazy afternoon
But then out from the sky I heard a great big boom
Eh, yo, I couldn't tell you why
But purple rain straight started falling from the sky
I started to cry, I thought it a lie
I prayed for my mother oh me oh my
You should of seen the people jumping and crying and screaming
Believing the seasons was changing; the rain was the pain of the nature
And running and coming and going and low and beholding
And wishing the sun was golden and hoping it wasn't over
Damn, now people to this day can't tell you what I saw
It was raw; it broke every mortal thought, every law
Yo, in awe I was, a buzz, then a light, and it said to me right

"We be them rap kids from galaxies a far
And it seems that maybe your rhymes are up to par
So if you want to live on within this universe
You have to kick a dope verse, and don't curse"

Oh hey well what do you know?
My life came down to how well I could really flow
So I thanked god for this magna stage
And dropped that rhyme on the corner and it went this way:

I take it to the limit infinite, I been it committed to finish
I did it and if they bit it I heavy hitted to get it
This record of water is sort of the slaughter of mortal thoughts
It borders on orders and can't be thought of the "bought by cash"
K dash, fly from going to last, what is the task you ask
And what alien form is this man talking
Is he human or Vulcan, escaping or stalking
Or walking away from the rhyme by sledding down white hills of snow
Tobogganing canadiana, my granny Georgiana, my brother stays in Atlanta
I rock over cabanas of intellectual manners
You get hit by the gamma rays sort of like David Banner

Now the mind is a terrible thing to waste
Even worse is the great void of infinite space
That extends beyond time
Beyond all math
Your watch can only measure the second that just passed but
That doesn't matter; I'm just a B-Boy
That gets mad excited when the crowd makes
(sound of crowd noise)
