[Intro]
Don't ask me why
(See this right here?)
When they're coming from the sky
(This will last forever)
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

Don't ask me why
(Tell my people if you had enough)
When they're coming from the sky
(You wanna bring it back)
Don't ask me why
(Sing the anthem)
Don't ask me why
(Sing it with me)

[Hook]
I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

[Verse 1]
It's a return of an original man
From outer space
The human race
Is like eyes without a face
I pulled your card
I saw you try to fool God
And now you wanna switch up the game, it's rather hard
Damn, I thought that they was down for mine
But alas, a good woman is hard to find
So I get up, I'm really fed up with infidelity
This is my penalty for infiltrating with the melody
At times I look at my face in the mirror
And wonder if the picture is clearer
To me than to them
But then again
They sell crack to kids
And that's what is
So I just attack the biz
And it's just my soul obligation
To unite this whole hip-hop nation
Face it, we takin' over your radio station
Hasid, this is the time for jubilation

[Hook]
I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

[Verse 2]
Now, we can break it down like this
And we can break it down like that
They stole hip-hop
Come on, let's take it back
To east coast stomping
Romping over the rhythm
And then I hit 'em
With the most beautful jewels
That shine through the darkness, sparkness
Some are concerned with
Who's the hardest artist
Call me the fluent MC
Slipping through the cracks
Bring it back definitely
Now, who is the man that's forgoten his name
Living in shame
And can't recall the place where we came from
The same one dancing on your video screen
Hideous dreams
I can't belive we do it for cream, yo
But it's the anthem to turn back the tables
Fables, whack MC's working for labels
I'll see you all in the next lifetime
It's not Kheaven
Just a message from Serious Seven

[Hook]
I won't fear anymore-more
Hip-hop is back for sure, sure
'Cause it took our love away
Now she's come back to stay
I feel sorry for MC-C's
Who sold out so easily-ly
But the truth shall set them free, free
Have no fear, no, no fear, oh no

[Bridge]
Don't ask me why
When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

Don't ask me why
When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

Don't ask me why
When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

Don't ask me why
When they're coming from the sky
Just let it go
There's some things you'll never know

Yeah
Uh, uh

[Outro]
You wanna rap with me
I'm a rap Vader
You wanna rap against me
I'm a rap terminator
I'm getting mad props
Like on a movie set, yeah

The time runs out
And then the beat runs loose, no doubt
Take me to the ending
Eff with the record
Eff with the record

(A universe without light is lightless)
Easy on the motion
Not a people's locomotion
