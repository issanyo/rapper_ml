[K-Os]
Yeah, it's so hard to remain authentic
Everything around me is changing
Even the earth is moving through different places in outer space, but one thing remains the same
(yeah) Til the end of time (uh-huh) I think I'll remain... (yo)
I think I'll just stay...

[Chorus:]
A B-Boy, standing in my B-Boy stance [7x]
A B-Boy, standing in my... yeah...

[Verse 1]
From the top of the highest summit, again we run it
A hundred and forty-four shimmering lights stunning
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of MCing
Blowing word to the wind
While we ascend to limit the sins and pretend
We're still human, when in fact we're only half
The other path extends infinity do the math
I try to laugh, but they pull me down like crabs in a bucket
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows, so Kheaven keeps inventing the flows that turns black pros
To white foes...You're just supposin'
Have you heard my words moving at light speed and getting blurred?
It's all so incredible, decibels at a glance standing in my B-Boy stance

[Chorus]

This one leads the way...
[K-Os]
Break
Break
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back
On the wheels of steel, cut it up back to back
Break

Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
Thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate
Shouldn't let 'em in, the answers not to debate
But to observe the debating and then we can understate

[Verse 2]
Yo party people listen up at the drop of dime
They took cameras to africa for pictures to rhyme
Over old...yes, the great pretenders
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers
Damn...another diamond from the mine, another cold secret hoping
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind
But, I'm flipping and stepping and rocking the roll, taking control
Paying my tolls, who's in control?
I'm playing a role so people will remember that
I'm just a servant of rap, hoping to bring it back

[Chorus]

This one, leads, the way...
[K-Os:]
Break

[Breakdown]
I'm just a B-Boy...
And it brings me joy...
I'm just a B-Boy...
[???]
I'm just a B-Boy...
And it brings me joy...
I'm just a B-Boy...

I'm just a B-Boy...
Yeah
