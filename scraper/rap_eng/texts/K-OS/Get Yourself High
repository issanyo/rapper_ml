[Intro]
Just get yourself high (x5)

[Hook]
Dont rely on this to get you high
Dont rely on us to get you high

[Verse 1 : K-OS]
Hey
Wait
Hold up
Electrify
Let the fire elect the high
Connect the sky
To the sense they blade keeps spinning
All around the world
And the world keeps sinning
I been in a crazy situation
Since I learned the art of watching patients
Big shouts to the hip-hop nation
Just dance for elation
Yeah

[Hook]
Don't rely on this to get you high
Don't rely on us to get you high

[Bridge]
What you really lost
Is it really lost
What you really thought

[Verse 2 : K-OS]
Hey (Echoing)
Yo
Put the needle on the record
Here we go again
It's the brand new funk for real
Mass appeal is everlasting
I've seen you forecasting direction
Insurrection is served on a 12 inch plater
Mostly correct data over matter
Is a mind that you'll find
Whos design is international
Rational
Back in the days we were trying to rap
No gats in the backpack
Yo caught many styles but the free one
Instead of writing a rhyme I'd rather be one
Two yo kiddy watch what you do
I live in the (?) but believe they hold the fuse
Now you got to get inside to get it off

[Hook]
What you really lost
Is it really lost
What you really thought

[Break : K-OS]
You don't know (x8)

[Outro]
Don't rely on us to get you high
Don't rely on this to get you high
Don't rely on us to get you high
Don't rely on this to get you high
Just get yourself high (x9)
