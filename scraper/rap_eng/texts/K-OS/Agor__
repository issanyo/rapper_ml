[Verse 1]
I dey come talk true
It's been a while,stay woke was a bad tune
But chale money no dey make I pay for airplay
Payola dey suck dough like fruit juice
And chale school just dey eat my time, the way them dey pay chale boy for dey try
Nowhere cool for this side,awiase yɛ hye
24/7 with the sunshine, see the game is the game
And chale man for dey blow but the tracks I dey drop all remain on a low
Forget that
Music ebe side thing,studio say make I dey pay, I broke
SEE THE GAME IS THE GAME
And chale man for dey blow but the tracks I dey drop all remain on a low
Forget that
Music ebe side thing,studio say make I dey pay, I broke

[Hook]
See the game is the game
I dey school I dey mow , fraud boys dey take money dey play
The game is the game
You want buy Iphone? Circle ebe soap you go take
The game is the game
Chale she chop my money. The girl chop my money
The game is the game
Chale he chop my money, the boy chop my money

[Verse 2]
Town go be so you want move
Berekuso taxis dey pick mind
The car for house you dey want use, but poppi say boys for take time
Life's stress just dey test all your patience, you want relax you dey take high
Boys jump ship them take fly
Aburokyi dey be for the west side
You go uni 4 years, it is time for a job
Applications 10, them no dey source
Momi dey bore, you dey house dey chop bread
Kempinski niggas dey ball
Nonsense
The club saff you want pop some drinks and show you're a top man
But the table ebe 10K, so you stand by the bar
2 shots then you stop there

[Hook]
[Refrain]
Hwɛ agorכ ne agorכ,agorכ ne agorכ
The game is the game
Hwɛ agorכ ne agorכ,agorכ ne agorכ
The game is the game
Chale she chop my money,the girl chop my money
Chale he chop my money,the boy chop my money

[Verse 3]
Ok yes
Bɛɛma ne mmaa matters
I really want move to some babe with expensive taste, but pocket
Love dey be if you get dough
Love be stress if you're dead broke
Love dier some you for let go
Girls dier some you for talk no
Sikapɛ so she's calling my line
You go call back? you dey gnash airtime
Fake dadabee, you dey bost wiFi
Val's day dey come you dey feed am lies
Real with the fake vibes you dey love am die
You go call back? you dey gnash airtime
So the fraud boy go come take all the girls
You dey buy am juice, he dey buy am wine
