And I don't, need you, to say
You don't love me if you don't
Cause I love, you anyway
Yeah, down the Avenue
Yeah, walking down the Avenue
I see you walking down the Avenue
I see you walking every day
I even notice when your jeans are new
Looks like there's nothing left to say
How did I become such a selfish man?
Chasing my memories down the block
It's cause I'm hanging on the Avenue
That's why my girlfriend is hip-hop
So I don't, need you, to say
You don't love me if you don't
Cause I love, you anyway ohhh
I see you walking down the street sometime
I see you walking now and then
I see you on the tv-show sometime
Are you for real or just pretend?
And when the night shine falls
And the city lights shine
I'm right by your side
It's cause I'm hanging on the Avenue
That's why I got nothing to hide
Cause I don't need you to say
You don't love me if you don't
Cause I love you anyway ohhh
I'm just a man with some diamonds in my pocket

Downtown, it can be you and me
Downtown, downtown and we can ride the TTC (like we used to)
Downtown, this can be you and me
Downtown, downtown and we can ride the TTC
So I don't, need you, to say
You don't love me, if you don't
Cause I love you anyway ohhh
No I don't, need you, to say
.............................Sometimes
Exitlude (last 3:14 minutes of the song)
Now, I'm just chillin' in the sand in a Neil Young style
I'll catch you in a minute, I'd rather chase for a while
I love the east coast, which is west coast
Touch down, _________________, butter on toast
I didn't use to know the art of saying nothing
Is harder then saying something ____________
Cause nothing is constantly rushing through
The front door which I lost my keys last week
I can't speak, but you know what I'm saying cause
I ___________________________________________
So don't give me the run around time
It's chasing us down
I got to keep it moving...
[No idea what he says for a few minutes after]
You led me to a parking lot, and lost the car that
You came with and drove me from the backseat
I like the wind in my face, top-down, music
And rhyming in the backseat
You drove me to a parking lot, and lost the car that
You came with and drove me from the backseat
I like the wind in my face, top-down, music
And riding in the backseat
