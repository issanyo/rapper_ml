[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Ayo, your dope ain't worth nothing
Pistol whip you like you stole something
I'm always drinking roll something
Always wanna put a hole in something
Contraband in the air wander
These fuck niggas can't stand us
Pyrex whippin' got us living
Get a brick your whole block gotta chip in
Ridiculous y'all niggas in the way
Chain smokin' fifty sour roaches in the ash tray
I'm so focused, cobra clutch the coke ferocious
My nigga in the sixes he be rollin'
My young bitch she be rollin'
Chrome 800 gotta grip it like I'm bowling
I'm sad Brad Vetement and soda
Ayatollah fiends lying over
The God nigga AZ in a Saab, nigga
My shooter begging for a job, nigga
I gotta fire room in Cod, nigga
Two bedroom condo in Gwinnett
Plus another condo on my neck
Run the jewels no Killer Mike
One button got the ceiling right
Hold ya head it'll be alright
He got another 3000 nights
He okay, the nigga pray 5 times a day
He cool, he bool

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
He pray 5 times a day
He pray 5 times a day
That nigga pray 5 times a day

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Correct
Fancy leather and my sweats Supreme shirt
Glock 9 with the inf' beams
Spray ya team we can go to war
[?] wild freaks on the floor money galore
Bagging raw got their fingers hurtin'
My youngins tearing up the block
And the beamers swervin'
Just left Juma hope the prayers working
Out here reckless with the hecklers
Ballin the streets they can hear the hecklin'
Cuban necklace big medallion pro black
Half Italian  blessed with pops features
Mom's wisdom Quran's teaching esoteric
Barbaric but the weed calm me
St. Laurent laundry hundred G's on me
Flee homie not a nigga that can breathe on me
Can't get close to the God jet fuel in the God
Me and Gunn Cheech and Chong
My shorty from Milan parents they from CapeTown
Started with a  Qp got it up to eighty pounds
Went and got that AK it hold more than eighty rounds
Hit the ground pray five times a day
It still ain't enough
Try coasting through life but still in a rut
These jams got a solid touch we be urging to bust
It's like we worship the rush of getting money
Turning niggas to dust Hit the mosque
Since Allah hope Allah never give up on us
I'm praying five times a day and I don't think it's enough
It just ain't enough

[Hook: Westside Gunn]
He pray 5 times a day
He pray 5 times a day
That nigga pray 5 times a day
