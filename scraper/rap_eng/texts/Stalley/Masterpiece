[Intro: (?)]
Huuh
Ladies and gentlemen
You are about to witness the
Natural elegance of the
Black masterpiece
Experience the rebirth
Of a musical renaissance that is
MadStalley

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Naw fuck that B
Style on 'em
MadStalley
Let's get it straight, mentally intact
Back after shedding the dead weight
Body looking great, Ohio we are back
Feeling like the Browns return in '99
Where's my dog pound at
When in-town goon step out, everyone get back
Its the swag like no other, no slack
In my walk I'm a bad mother fucker
Built next to the toughest, bring ruckus
Head bustas, blunt smokers
Pretty girls can't get enough of us
44, 646
Y'all in love with us
Stay the humblest, adjust to no rules
Get ran over, run with us
Satan'll tell 'em to see Stalley
A masterpiece, fine art
Every angle I attack is sharp around me
With the pencil world composing like Mozart
Einstein's mind, athlete's heart
A kick start to my imagination's conscious thought

[Hook: Stalley]
I'm just what they created me to be
All the glory, pain, passion is me
A masterpiece
All the blood, sweat and tears
All the years that I feared I wouldn't be
A masterpiece
I'm just what they created me to be
All the glory, pain, passion is me
The masterpiece
And I am who I am
Imma be who I be
So ain't no changing me
I'm a masterpiece

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Stronger than ever no ape, no gorilla
The evolution I am man, no confusion I am him
I am man, hotter than frying pans
No changes, no contradiction
(?) words, wear the crucifixtion
Thought about quitting
But knew my addition to music was more important than restriction
So I'm giving heart, body and soul
I rose from the streets of the O
Stranglehold on hip-hop, not letting go
Killing these rappers, taking their soul
Without losing anything I stand for
You can call me the miracle
The realest cat you ever knew
Never fold I am better for your stereo
This is truth in your earlobe
Not the wackiness you used to
This is proof to
The doubters and non-believers
That if you stick to what you believe in
Every rhyme and reason
Will heal lashes and soak up the bleeding
From the pop culture beating
Your lyrical (?) it ain't keep speaking

[Hook: Stalley]
I'm just what they created me to be
All the glory, pain, passion is me
A masterpiece
All the blood, sweat and tears
All the years that I feared I wouldn't be
A masterpiece
I'm just what they created me to be
All the glory, pain, passion is me
The masterpiece
And I am who I am
Imma be who I be
So ain't no changing me
I'm a masterpiece

[Outro: Stalley]
Yeah
OK I'd like to welcome everybody to the show
We just getting it started right now
Right there was a joint called Masterpiece
And that's what I like to call myself
Thank you, thank you
'Preciate it
This next joint we going into is called Slim's Return
I actually wrote this
On my way home from work
I was walking up 14th street
And I was just in a New York state of mind
