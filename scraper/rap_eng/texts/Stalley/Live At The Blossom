[Intro 4x]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I’m live from the streets
’73 Caprice with the alligator seats
Alpine beats beat the block up all night
Wood grain a good thing, we riding all types
Chevy’s all white, blue pin stripe
All American me, patriotic when I ride
Bulletproof outside for you monks that stalk
I got something for death wishers wishing that I
Ease up for a minute
Man I’m pushing city limits, no more cruising, I done did it
Spend straight to the top
Made a couple bands
Now it’s time to hit the block and bring my niggas out to shop
All new fabrics, Jordan’s automatic
Couple gold chains, couple 4-4matics
Case a nigga want static
We mob out Milq City G’s, we are savage
Came from the basements and the attics
Jump shot the serve rock be the average mind state of a young black male
The trap’s so small but we trap so well
Spend it all at once and make it back so well
The circle of this hell they say heaven’s beyond these gates
I swear I see heaven every time I enter the place
It’s the faith I have in change
But it always stays the same as I ride around in vane
And they say

[Hook]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Ooh, ooh
And we smoking on that
Na na na na na
Na na na na na (got me feeling like)
Ooh (that feeling’s like) ooh

[Verse 2]
I got my dark shades on
Blocking out these strobe lights
Eyes blood shot, I’ve been sippin’ all night
On my 7 jay paper’s all white
I’m so distant from the star type
No one's themself in music
Insanity is drilling me so the drugs I use it
To float away from this bullshit, abuse it
Tryna escape the bull pit, that same old blueprint
Pretend friends, fake women, the whole niners groolish
Nightmares in night is, slight glance from Chevy chairs
Heavy airs make it hard to breathe
The money’s so fast so it makes it hard to leave
Temptation in the entertainment, all for the love of being famous
The cool ones end up being the lamest
So rappers I spoke to became the strangers and nameless
Brainless, faceless, forgotten
Were sitting at the top now they falling to the bottom
Now they crowd around me, watching my every move cuz I’m the next king
Gracious and militant, Martin Luther’s dream
Peeked the whole scene through the lens of Malcolm Little
Ready for the revolution, same riffle, same window
Man, what’d I get myself into?
What’d I get myself into?
What’d I get myself into?

[Outro]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
Ooh, ooh
