[Intro]
Yeah
This some G shit
You know
I traveled the world a lot
And one of my favorite spots is Paris, you know what I'm saying?
In Paris you know
When they say what it is, they say voila
Correct

[Verse 1]
Silver SLS outside the opera house
Bape shark hoodie raging bull fires
BCG gold shining under lights
3:30 am out in Paris cause (?) make my ring bling
When I shine and you shine it really ain't the same thing
This paper in my pocket ain't green
My life should be a painting
Hung inside the Louvre, at the Moulin Rouge
Hung up on the groove of this midwest repper
When you talk rap, ain't none better
When you talk fleet, ain't none fresher
The coup's inside leather
And you miss, you can't do no better
So hop your ass in this two seater
Fully loaded all new features
Its like a spaceship
Jaw dropper, let your face hit
Js stay lit, drive the world with niggas I came up with
Never walk with simps cause that shoe don't fit
Got knots and a judo grip
I'm getting money nigga (I'm getting money nigga)
Show it off in the bezel let them diamonds drip
For everyone who passed away, that I grew up with
Pitchforks in the air for my southeast click
Slick ruler tip jeweler new Frank Mueller the hands go tick (I'm getting money nigga)
Everything automatic from the cars to the hammer I grip
Born hustler if this rap don't work then this hand gon' flip
I told 'em don't worry plan A gon' stick
That's word to chico homie bank on it

[Break: Method Man & Ghostface Killah]
M: I said I am what I am
And I do what I do
G: Task force shit global with my crew
M: I said I am what I am
And I do what I do
G: Pull all blacks ride Chevy with my crew
M: I said I am what I am
And I do what I do
G: Three fingers spell the set with my crew
M: I said I am what I am
And I do what I do
G: Stack Mad bread, catch wreck with my crew
M: I'm getting money nigga

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Life lavish (?) to escape the average
Still savage, pants saggin', hat backwards
Still bossing, flossing designer fabrics
Still lost in translation out in Paris
Militant Soulquarian, native tongues blaring
Jungle brother in air raids (?) edotion
The style is wisdom expressed through colors
BCG blue everything my neck is smothered in African gold
The Rolli make the time go slow
Fast money from the sixties I got rhymes to go
Run my stack up international
Then I'm back in the states, tips on my grand national
Thick smoke when my crew link, don't give a care about what you think
Don't talk losing in the circle of winners
SS logos on fenders
We came a long way from dirty niggas in the hallway
Eating fishstick dinners
We turn nothing into something
Man this shit just in us

Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime
Je t'aime

[Outro]
I will share with
With a man working at McDonalds, washes dishes
Football players, basketball players, lawyers, doctors
I will not share with somebody who breaks the law
(Laughter)
When you break the law you be inquisitive about anothers
So he wants a normal job but I don't give a fuck about no other man
See I just want to get with this woman
But a thug want to know shit about me
You don't know that you're telling this man shit
And this not right
If your man works at McDonalds, whats he doin'?
It ain't none of my business
Alright listen
I'm not gonna judge him, I'm not gonna badmouth him
I told him, I told her too
I said "If another man talks about another man
Dogs him out to get with a woman, don't ever get with that woman
Shit I can't understand
So thats like when you come through
Rich man'll worry about the broke ass nigga shit
Say bitch you gotta discredit me and he's the man
Well I shouldn't even exist
He should be on so strong and your bitch was like ain't even know you had a baby boo
Like let alone this nigga broke or this nigga lame
Or bitch, I'm not stuck on that nigga
Bitch I'm that nigga bitch get with me
I don't know nothing about this man
So if you hate on this man
To get with this woman
Yous a lame
How you doin' honey?
Where you at?
Sweating my ass off outside on the patio
You don't want to (?) out there
Are you here with me now
Are you with me?
N Glen'll getcha
Oh hey baby
He'll take care of you. I tried to tell him a few of the things
