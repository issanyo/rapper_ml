[Hook: Stalley]
Light a tree is my therapy
Bong rips taking long trips
Moccasins on like a Cherokee
Cruise the day 'til the stars peak
All these dreams within arm's reach
Every exhale it calms me
Trying to see the future like a palm read
And it looks so bright through this bomb weed

Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Cone sparked, jeans stone washed
Mind gone, I need Onstar
Remember a million seemed so far
Me and my partners in my mom's car
Hot boxing talking 'bout how we gonna live good when we all on
Five cars, wheels all chrome
Taking trips to Cabo
Change the weather, gotta leave the snow
Corner store trips got weed to roll
Young kids with good intentions
Living life like heathens though
Ask the neighbors they seen the show
Mommas kept the faith they seen the glow
Amount to nothing that's what we was told
Counted out from the start
That's why reefer's rolled

[Hook: Stalley]
Light a tree is my therapy
Bong rips taking long trips
Moccasins on like a Cherokee
Cruise the day 'til the stars peak
All these dreams within arm's reach
Every exhale it calms me
Trying to see the future like a palm read
And it looks so bright through this bomb weed

Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Ashes fall on my space jams
Eyes red in these Ray Bans
Weed orange like spray tans
Bubble gum scent in my spray can
Trying to hide the odor this potent doja
Just stuffed the cone, 'bout to light the clover
Lucky me I'm never riding sober
All the pot in my thoughts 'til the fight is over
Lone stoner elevate through malice
Through shaky grounds I kept my balance
Tried to shake me down, downplayed my talents
(I don't bow to cowards, I scour malice)
Don't wait 'til I'm dead let me smell my flowers
Love from the people that's my allowance
Pass good deeds like good weed
Share the wealth don't do greed

[Hook: Stalley]
Light a tree is my therapy
Bong rips taking long trips
Moccasins on like a Cherokee
Cruise the day 'til the stars peak
All these dreams within arm's reach
Every exhale it calms me
Trying to see the future like a palm read
And it looks so bright through this bomb weed

Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
I'll see you in the morning
Goodnight
Goodnight
Goodnight
