87 Regal
I told her raise that glass to the air
Roll something and put that grass in the air
I can upgrade you, take that glass out your ear
Put a stone on your finger, let you shine everywhere
Take you everywhere you never been
My condo you can settle in
Your convo is just heaven sent
Im comfortable as I ever been
Can't put no number on you
I Don't know how they rate you a 10
You just really outta here
No telescope could zoom you in
So when
I seen you I had to move on in
Shoot you a lil life, a lil game and let you choose ya man
This ain't really game doe
So ain't really a lose or win
You gonna shine regardless
Wit that beautiful skin
I know I'm just one of many men
Letting these words fly thru the wind
Hoping they land on your heart
So we can depart and park this chevy in A park
Star gazing in the dark
We align these stars of the heart
Don't want these cosmos falling apart
Our universe dance to Mozart
A symphony from the Monte car

We Ride ride low, Fired up
In the streets at night
Bending round da corners wit dem beats on high
Shaking down till the stars fall from the sky

Nightly excursions we just free our mind
We got lost in the day, not keeping time
Swiss watch with sweep design
Chanel patterns, bling shine
Mikkimotto fall on my ladies polo
Relax fit like we left soho
Hit the cars switch then we bounce like pogo
Yolo
Is the only way we know doe
Stepping out the frame like a photo
New money, and your money low doe
So you can't go where we roll
We the stars of the night, but we trying to be low
Merlot and Clicquot
Chauffeured in then regal
Same year dat she born
87
We gone
