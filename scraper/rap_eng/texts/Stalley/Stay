[Intro: Jesse Boykins III]
Don't go away
Don't leave
Please stay with me
Don't go
Don't leave
Please stay
Don't go away

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time

[Verse 1: Stalley]
I love the way you feel
I love the way you look
I love your soft moles
I love your dirty looks
When I'm up in the kitty
Know that love is coming with me
Got me pushing inside of you
Trying to touch spine and kidney
Its funny how we sex like pornstars
Then get to fighting like Bob and Whitney
It's f'in with me
How the passion gets mixed up
Then we effortlessly break up everything we just fixed up
But we just nuts then back to the nuts
We all saw the love
In my mind its just us taking sex too far
We just are who we are
And we spar to the death
Then we love and we cry
Til there ain't no room for another step
I don't wanna walk away
I just want love to stay

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time

[Verse 2: Stalley]
All the games that we play
All the lies, all the pain that's been given away
All the betrayal
I just want it out of the way
A brand new start, a brand new heart
A whole bunch of forgiveness
While I bandage these man-made scars
All my pride, all my heart to the side
Put you by my side
You're my heart, my life
This is us together, c'mon let's ride
Or maybe we could fly
Extraterrestrial you and I
Out on a love ship
Earth we above it
Know I'm sounding weird but I know you love it
So stop with that hard shit
Niggas go through hardships
This is soft work love
We don' seen harder shit
This is just relationship
Not friend to a foe
Without you a house not a home
And if you can't save room in yours
I can always see the door

[Bridge: Jesse Boykins III]
Save room
My love
Save room
My love
Save room

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time
Say that you'll stay a little
Don't say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
A little bit of love is worth a moment of your time
