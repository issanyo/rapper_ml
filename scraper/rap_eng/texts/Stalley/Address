[Intro]
It's all good, it's already
Yeah, already understood, ain't nothin
Still the same old, that's all
Ain't nothin change, fool, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uhh, nigga for what
Get down with these suckers when I'm high as fuck
And they under us, catch a crook in ya neck
From trying to watch the jets, Mr. Tokyo Drift
Spent yen on a vet, lookin' for ya bitch fool
Take one guess she caught up in the rapture
Wakin and bakin Anitaâ€™s greatest hits blastin
Pedal mashin, paper twistin'
Scrape an engine, Rad Racer
No 3D glasses just a high ass rapper, Spitta
Nigga in the building, nah I'm on the roof chillin'
The pool up here, couple chicks I grew up with
Bottles in the cooler
If ya don't know how to do it homie I'll school ya
Barrel roll, loop de loop, top gun manuevers
Makin hot wheels outta hoopties holdin it down like balloon strings

[Hook]
It's all good ain't gotta be said, it's already understood
Ain't nothin, ain't nothin' change but the address
Fool, ain't nothin' change but the address
We still the same mode niggas switchin the script
But we still playin' the same role, and so
Ain't nothin' changed but the address fool, ain't nothin change

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Starin out the villa at the ocean miles long
Tryin' to figure out raps to put up in a song
Nights long but the day's short, Nike shorts
Argyle socks, Jordan three's, lounge gear
Long beard you can tell I ain't from round here
Obvious with the occasional glare from the natives
Call 'em back tell my mama I make it
Not complacent with the life style
Feels good but it's hard to crack a smile
When the ones you came up with not around
Roll a joint after pickin through the pound, whole perception done changed
Funny how a three hour flight can make ya life change
Tight things I be thinkin on
When I'm driftin in and out of herb clouds
Hangin on every second of the moment
So you can feel all the memories I come home with
And for those that miss me, I'll be back don't trip in the 'Maro with the shift kit
Ocean side, doors open wide tryin' not to be sea sick
Plottin in the tropics thinkin' how I'm gone run this
Back in the states when I leave

[Outro]
Yeah, SkiBeatz
