[Verse 1: Stalley]
They ask me why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I-I- I tell them that's cause I zone with ghetto inhabitants
My life's real, I just paint the ghetto extravagant
I don't exaggerate my life not even a tad bit
An extremist bastard with a joint lit
Soldiers on my side I anointed
Point fifths at losers we don't roll with
Everyone's an enemy if you don't roll with, BCG geniuses
A team of kings and queens that believe in this
Overcoming struggles that we squeamish with
Fi- fill bulimic stomachs make money
Just to feed the kids, I know that feeling, six months ago
You could still see my ribs
Life ain't what you think it is so think before you wish for this
My life is like a fisherman's, I sit by water fighting winter winds
Now I'm, now I'm in a tinted Benz color cinnamon
Feeling like an enemy of the working man
Tryna keep a hold of my soul and what I came for
And not just work for bands, calluses on working hands
The sweeping third hands, Swish watches with the gold band
Silver canister reserve, I still deserve this whole land
Forty acres and a mule on top of a mountain

[Hook: Rashad]
Come from the bottom but now we on top
Picture me rolling, the box top drop
Ay, the day is golden
Picture me rolling
Came from the bottom but now we on top
Top of the world

[Verse 2: Stalley]
They ask me why I hardly kick the gangsta raps
I told them if you gangsta, you don't have to say you that
I'm a loyal nigga, I don't have to play with straps
And I take my craft serious, I don't play with raps
I'm a- I'm a dog, I'm a beast, I don't pussycat or lollygag
Most these niggas can't beat a polygraph
A gat polly swag, a bunch of molly fags, a geeked out
On some other trash, lying about they fake past
Or how they let foreigns crash but never seen a foreign tag
Red wine, pour my glass, French [mains on kind?] vineyards
Vignettes and prime dinners, pretend this ? dinner
Now it's more gangsta than that, young nigga out the trap
Down on the other side of the map, all from the words I spat
A wordsmith who's worthy of that who gave a normal life for stars and stripes
His own soundtrack so you can see you can do it too
I worked inside of cubicles, sold shoes
Then I got on Protools and painted my views
Through the seats of this old school
Now it's forty acres and a mule with a mountain view
Now it's forty acres and a mule with a mountain view

[Hook]
