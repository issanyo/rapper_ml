[Hook: Stalley]
Everywhere I go I'm hearing whispers
I'm in the field where the snakes slither
Serpents who bitter worship the gold and glitter
Napolean thoughts my mind is on something bigger
I'm usually in picture flossing that shit they worship
Dancing in puddles, show 'em that shit is worthless
My style is more rugged, these young 'uns dressed in purses
My style is so smooth, I don't rehearse these verses

[Verse: Stalley]
Most rappers trash, fill every verse with curses
Or they copying Stalley, trying to steal my verbiage
But couldn't walk a mile in these white air forces
Porsche on 4 Gs, chain gorgeous
Same sauces
Slick Rick and Daddy Kane countless
Amounts of money in my pocket, still lossless
Remain lawless, don't do bosses
Authority I don't fuck with
Jewels I truck it
The shirt Trukfit
Shout to Weezy F
Tha Carter 3, I still bump it
Ring clustered, your girl love it
Been quiet for a minute but I'm still buzzing
And still hustling
If judge fuck with any niggas in my circle
Don't let fame hurt you
I've been grinding for a minute
Check the stained workboot
Started with a sixteen then that same work grew
I double up since address
Been flipping since mattress
Had the world doing backflips
Black Chevelle with the black lips
Plus the black automatic
In case a nigga want static
Mob deep like I'm Havok
Promote peace but I'll blast it
Good girl, I don't do ratchet
I'm a sneaker fiend, addict
Navy blue or the black shit
Made my wealth with my niggas
Seen too many in caskets
Fifth floor down on Sacks 5th
Buying Saint Laurent jackets
Dope boys strolling
You can have all that dab shit
I'd rather roll my dope
I don't fuck with that dab shit
Money, brown paper bag it
Weed green like a dragon
I be floating, Aladdin
Chick dressed in all satin
Got a cabin in Aspen
Calabasas a mansion
Her engagement ring dancing
Got on my man shit
My driveway a dealership
While you and your man shit all bitter
Seven hundred horses these snakes lsither
Its time I cut the grass to see clearer

[Hook: Stalley]
Everywhere I go I'm hearing whispers

My style is more rugged, these young 'uns dressed in purses
