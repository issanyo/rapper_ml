[Intro: Stalley]
Correct

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Hunnid stax hunnid stax what we trying to get
Eight room mansion that's how we tryin to live
Neck and wrist all icy that shit like a fridge
Nigga this the year of flossin f that humble shit
My nigga just copped a machine with a hunnid clip
Cause niggas shootin knee caps and snatching gold outta mouths
Gotta be safe when you come out your house
For a hunnid stax niggas a straight run in your house
So be careful what you baffle out your mouth
They put raffles on your scalp, like a fresh pair of Jordan's just came out
Ain't no waiting in line, ain't no taking they time
Niggas run up on you broad day put eight in your spine
Ain't no love just a whole lot of hate in they mind
And for that rush of adrenaline they snatchin your shine
Fuck lets floss though
Even if life is what it cost you
I mean we just out here making boss moves

[Hook: Stalley]
My label robbed me for a hunnid stax (Yeah)
Baby mama got me for a hunnid stax (Yeah)
Boy I feel like Deion Sanders (Whoo Whoo Whoo)
Cause I'm about to run it back!
Hunnid stax hunnid stax yeah a hunnid stax (On top of)
Hunnid stax hunnid stax yeah a hunnid stax (On top of)
Hunnid stax hunnid stax yeah a hunnid stax (On top of)
Hunnid stax hunnid stax yeah a hunnid stax

[Bridge: Stalley]
Never going broke, I ain't going back (Tell'em that)
Never going broke, I ain't going back (Tell'em that)
Never going broke, I ain't going back (Tell'em that)
Never going broke, (Run and tell'em that!)

[Verse 2: Stalley]
I hustle I get it that's what I'm put here for
I pivot I pitch it I got this corner sowed
I'm the realest out my city I put my corner on
I'm juggin somebody hit Fader and Cornerstone
These fiends got a itch I be that Cortisone
I push rhymes like weight right to a brick home
No silver spoons I climbed from underneath them dirt stones
Granny used to pray for me I still remember them church songs
Itch palms no dollars here, not even enough for bus fare
Got a job at the mall but it was to far to bus there
Ady had a studio might as well go bust some raps there
Plus 16th was hot and they was bustin straps there
I'm strapped yeah, notebook full of poison darts
I got a hard heart I tear your crew apart don't start with God
Arms to short to box, don't get chalked and thrown in box
Cause frontin boss moves will have you sitting lonely at the top
