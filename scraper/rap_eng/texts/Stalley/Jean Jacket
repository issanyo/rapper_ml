[Intro]
In this bitch freakin’ this Mild
You know how I get it

[Hook]
In the booth in this jean jacket (jean jacket)
Shit feelin’ like a straight jacket (straight jacket)
Going crazy from the madness (yeah)
Tryna appeal to the masses (masses)
Artists nowadays is new slaves (New slaves)
Tryna appeal to the masters (Masters)
Tap dancin’ to get a check
Who can run to it faster (Faster)
Labels puttin’ labels on me (Labels on me)
Haters still hatin’ on me (Hatin’ on me)
But I gotta make a way (Make a way)
Cause my fans been waitin’ on me (Waitin’ on me)
And they don’t understand all the politics (Politics)
Got me stressin’ but they don’t even acknowledge it (Acknowledge it)
Just wanna fill my brain with a hollow tip (Hollow tip)
Got a nigga mind on some suicidal shit

[Verse 1]
The devil workin’, his demons lurkin’
Distractin’ me from my purpose (purpose)
I admit I been a little off
Fell back, been a little lost
Needed time off just to find myself
Found myself was the real wealth (real wealth)
All this gold sittin’ on the shelf (shelf)
But I’d rather wear it on my neck (my neck)
Industry want me to change (change)
But I’d rather wear my respect
All these thoughts I be battlin’
Codeine in my abdomen (Abdomen)
Pickin’ up habits from my addict friends (Addict friends)
Another victim to the peer pressure (Peer pressure)
Wonder if God see me any lesser
With this whole pint sittin’ on the dresser
They say life come at you fast (Fast)
But lately its lookin’ real slow
They say this high make you feel good (Good)
But lately its feelin’ real low (Real low)
Tryna find ways to deal with the depression, confession
My own self blockin’ my progression
Distracted I blocked my own blessings (life lessons)
Worry ‘bout yourself fuck the rest of them
