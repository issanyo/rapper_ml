[Verse 1: Stalley]
Skipping rocks on this Pebble Beach
Rolling marijuana leaves, staring through this blue dream
Trying to formulate this piece of mind into a tranquil speech
Alone, but these snakes leech, trying to wrap around my ideas
I'm just trying to wrap around my mind's fears
Blind tears, you can't see the pain, but your ears hear
Everything my heart shares, I'm just trying to part hair
So I sit and spark here, smoking till I'm numb, yeah
Really, I just want the pain to go
Money, I ain't aiming fo', I just wanna lay low
Farm house, stable
Chevy with them 427's when I'm revving, hear them angels
It's like they screaming through my soul, my testimony shows
I rose through the rumble, never crumble
Held my head and stayed humble
Never did I succumb to, that fake ish, I run through
Right down to Sally's Garden and sit comfortable
She loves me, she loves me not...

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Walking through, picking all these roses
Dreaming of Ferrari Testarossas, and '76 Chevy Roadsters
Like the ones on my bedroom posters, right next to the pin-ups and the toasters
My dream wasn't Oprah's, I just want the normal life
Shoot guns with a pretty wife
But that life, no longer is it sitting right
I can't sleep at night, it's been that way for years
My life's been on cruise control, it's time I switch gears
Sally's Garden, only thing that moves me
The grass blades and the trees, they be talking to me
It's like some type of trippy movie
That all ends up on the loose-leaf
And every time I leave, I lose peace
God, please have mercy on my soul, accept everything I owe
And help me let go of all the things you deem sinful
I move fast, I'm 10 steps from being slow
And my change is worth gold
She loves me, she loves me not...
