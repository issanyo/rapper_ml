[Hook: Lil Wayne]

One for the money, two for the show (x2)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll
One for the money, two for the show (x3)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll
One for the money, two for the show (x2)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll
One for the money, two for the show (x3)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll

[Verse 1: Stalley]

6-6 minutes you're on, so I grab my gold rings with the signature stones
Cartier time piece, how my money has grown
Wheels all chrome, chains all gold
And the spirit is Slick Rick, the watch go tick-tick
The [?] is all swayed, and the ice go drip-drip
Fresher than an infant, baby, I'm just ballin'
Ride the Chevy slow where I'm from we call it crawlin' ([?])
The [?] bossin', flossin', get off him
Everything I do is super awesome
Weed from my dolphins, got this ish jumping like a dolphin, bankroll tossed in

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

One for the money, two for the show (x3)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll
One for the money, two for the show (2x)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll
One for the money, two for the show (3x)
Now clap your hands if you got a bankroll

[Verse 2: Stalley]

I hustle to the top, earn my way up in the game
Carry the heavy load, put that weight up on my chain
They say goal measures a man, and goals ain't the same
With success, it all change, I look back at where I came
