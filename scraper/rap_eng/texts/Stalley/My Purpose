My purpose um
I'm not sure if I hundred-percent know that yet
I think that I'm finding my purpose
I think that everyday as a man I grow
Um I know I'm definitely a family man
I'm definitely you know a spiritual man
And maybe that is what it is
Is to share that light into hip-hop
Because we don't get that a lot in hip-hop
You know we don't get a lot of people expressing their love
And their beliefs and their passions
For the simple things in life
You know like uh family or being a good dude or doing the right thing
So you know I think its coming back
But I think that we drifted away from
I guess the true elements or meanings of hip-hop
You know what I mean and uh
I think thats what's really carried us away from that a little bit
But I think its coming
We got a lot of artists who definitely still do
I don't want to say that all hip-hop is bad or doesn't have a message
Cause I think there's a lot who do
But um I don't know where we lost it
But you know people seem to only wanna have fun and turn up
And there's very few thinkers in the world now
You know everybody wants it spoon-fed
Nobody wants to-
If it isn't you know directly in their face
They kind of don't want to search for it
Or to really find the understanding of something
And that's what I'm trying to bring back into the music
