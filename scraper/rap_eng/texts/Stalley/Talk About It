[Intro: Stalley]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Correct

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Everybody's motto pop a bottle
Freak a model, fuck tomorrow
Live for today, do drugs it'll help with the pain
Being a junkie is the new cool
Or carry automatics long as pool sticks
Really don't want beef unless it comes from (?)
Loose lops ain't saying nothing
A whole bunch of gun bars but ain't spraying nothing
I swear, they fronting
But who am I to talk about it
Let niggas hang themselves
Who am I to talk them out of it
The coupe white, the rims powdered
I stunt too
Its art in this war, Stalley Sun Tzu
I got knowledge in my bag, I can front you
Ain't no talking to my back, I'll confront you
A real one all the real ones come run to
I drop jewels like 47th and 6th
Or get real gangster and 86 your bitch

[Hook: Stalley]
Talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it
So let's talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
I head everybody talking 'bout it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it

[Verse 2: Stalley]
I can care less about your money goals
I'm ten toes in that Rolls
Sitting on four 4Gs, my life gordy
I been balling like that Asian jeweler
Every joint long as a metric ruler
I flex Lex Luger
You flex, you still a loser with a drag
No comparison, I'm Mickey Harrison with the bag
I'm on South Beach lobster and crab
(?) stoned with millionaire blacks
Its a blessing what I made from these tracks
Never taking for granted
I've been a man since I seeped through them cracks
Beautiful rose with the prickle leaves
How I made it should be on Ripley's Believe It or Not
Ain't gon' stop 'til I'm leaving on top
One mission, I'm something different
Money don't drive me, I steer from the heart
Love and condition
A blueprint to a millionaire stock

[Hook: Stalley]
Talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it
So let's talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
I head everybody talking 'bout it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it

Talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it
So let's talk about it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
I head everybody talking 'bout it
Talk about it, let's talk about it
Everybody wanna talk about it
