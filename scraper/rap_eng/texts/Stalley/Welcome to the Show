Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
You are now rocking with the livest
I go by the name Stalley
And I represent the O-H-I-O, 330
So if you give me a moment of your time
Maybe forty minutes, sixty minutes
We gon' keep this thing going
We gon' move you
Take you through a little rollercoaster
Some ups, some downs
But Imma take you through my city
Your city
Across the world
Grab your passports
Come along with me
Mad Stalley
