[Verse 1]
White minks and the gator sleeves
White wine and some Cali trees
White SL with the butter soft seats
A player out and ladies shoutin' "Let me ride please"
As Dr. Dre's "Let Me Ride" bleeds out the trunk
I'm slumped in my seat, puffin' on a blunt
High as a mountain so I'm thinkin' 'bout a jump
Free fallin', springs fallin', I give 'em what they want
And I parade on the scene like a marchin' band does
[?] shout out, give a hater love
Middle finger dub, that's two for you cock suckers
I hate niggas who hate niggas, we supposed to be brothas
Menace to society, double cheeseburgers
Get my order, write it down and that's on my mother
Old dog with new tricks, take fists for loose slips
Don't talk shit if you been doing this, you mess on my crew since

[Hook]
White minks with the gator sleeves
Lumberjack buttoned up, Jordan threes
All my niggas snuggle up, now what it'll be?
Straight G's a bunch on knuckleheads popping trees
Outlaws stuffing jeans with a couple G's
This is old gold kings, BC jinx
This is old gold kings, BC jinx
This is old gold kings, BC jinx

[Verse 2]
Straight G's a bunch on knuckleheads popping trees
Outlaws stuffing jeans with a couple G's
Nothing average about the way I move
I iron statics with an iron tube
I ain't chiquer than jewels to be bleak, got moose
To the crews of the alpine to sink in through
My people made us paper weight to spit these jewels
Remarkable rhyming, minds like an eight sided diamond
I illuminate fools, ain't no rules to the game
So I cruise in the lane as my system booms
Tuning out the rest of the world, in my rearview what's left of the world
Dress my queen up in leopard and pearls
Fox purse, seats with balling ball squirrels
'68 Camaro, dance apparels, I call it my jungle glass house
I cleaned it up pretty and then let the ass bells puffing on Keisha
Listening to cash out, nigga how I came from a life to being a cash cow
So it's white minks and gator sleeves when I raps now

[Hook]
