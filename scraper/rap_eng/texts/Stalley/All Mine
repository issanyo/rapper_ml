[Sample]
If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten
I will not become a page in someone else’s history book
I’m running out of time, which means you’re running out of time

[Intro]
All mine, all mine
So sweet, all mine, all mine, yeah

[Hook] (x2)
The power’s mine (all mine)
The throne’s mine (all mine)
Iron chalice, filled with sweet wine (so sweet)

[Verse 1]
And my army, takin’ they sweet time
But I’m merciless, merciless with the verseses
Kill any unloyal servant who doesn’t worship his
Black stag a million men black staff stormin’ storms in
Fill this black graph, iron flyin’ bodies dyin’
Leave with toe tags to rule this [?] I never left
Matter fact blood of a king I [?] that
Courtesy of burnt crack
[?] Street across from Bluefields and prison camps
In this war five kings still clash
So be ready for war or get your wig peeled back
I’m ridin’ horses through the jungles where them killas live at
Neighborhoods considered thrones and they will kill for that
Wolves betray the King like the American Dream, and they don’t fight fair
Game of Thrones, while I’m awake in this nightmare

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge]
All mine, all mine
So sweet
All mine, all mine

[Verse 2]
Rebellious rebel my nature to set fury
I’m the judge executioner I run the jury
From Stormland to Japan I choose where the kings land
Rough sack and a pack for when the king land
30,000 wolves, that’s my band of brothers
Loyal savages, they don’t bang with others
My bloodline deep, can’t take nothing from us
Nights of the watch, gold watch, all ice covered
Got three chains on, call ‘em the Wildlings
Ice cold silk robe, a king of kings
I’m who they all wanna be, I’m a dreamer’s dream
I’m who they all wanna be, a dreamer’s dream

[Hook] (x2)

[Bridge] (x2)

[Outro: Sample]
There’s only one [?] left in Westeros
He’s got the birth right, he’s in his prime
He’s a tried untested battle commander
And he doesn’t just talk about paying people back, he does it
