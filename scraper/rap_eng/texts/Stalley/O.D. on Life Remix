Let’s OD on life
Remix
Uh, Come on

Been around the world and I I I
Know you think you fly but I’m flya
Know you think your high but I’m highya
Come and take a (?) of this fiya
Get right get right
Cause I done OD’ed on life
This what cha look like
Look like look like
When you done OD’ed on life

I walk into places everybody won’t be
Walk in with something everybody won’t see
Sorry young boy but she rolling wit me
Been through the hard times on my J.O.B
Now I’m here dog Nothing to fear dog
Struggle ain’t nothing Got to persevere dog
Imma little dog Big bite so get right
Who you mugging boy Betta get cha lip right
This flight bout to take off So I don’t take a day off
Going hard in the paint Like it was the playoffs
I stay off the purp But the beat make you lean though
Me and JB making history and we ain’t know
He the beat boy and I’m the speaker This the key note
Play my cards right Like I’m hooping for patino
Whole click dressed in black Jack no casino
People you never seen nothing like me before

Been around the world and I I I
Know you think you fly but I’m flya
Know you think your high but I’m highya
Come and take a (?) of this fiya
Get right get right
Cause I done OD’ed on life
This what cha look like
Look like look like
When you done OD’ed on life

Hopped up out the bed threw my Jordan 4s on
Put my little gold on smelling like Tom Ford
Hit the road in my beamer looking like the Concord
Leather on my seats wood in my consol
Got a yellow bone Yellow bone mouth full of gold
For the N.O. reside in the fourth ward
She love bounce music favorite label take four
Evertime she in the car chopper on the stereo

Sagging and we swaggin 500 horses 4 pipes in the back
You can keep them long stares we got fight for that action
But we don’t want no problem we just ODing on life
We ain’t hollering but we ain’t backing down neither
Never silent a bunch of fly fly’s with the attitude of tyrants
(??)  them new age pirates
Know around the world as the all time flyest

Been around the world and I I I
Know you think you fly but I’m flya
Know you think your high but I’m highya
Come and take a _____ of this fiya
Get right get right
Cause I done OD’ed on life
This what cha look like
Look like look like
When you done OD’ed on life

Okay I really wake up feeling like the champ is here
Long dreadlocks you would think that Sampson's here
Mission Vision in the building Yeah the camp is here
Walk in with a red fox like Fred Sanford here
Oh boy You don’t know boy Just a poor boy From the land of Po Boys
Everybody just chillin Ain’t nobody toting tools
Shorty said he like my kicks So I gave him my shoes
Yeah I made his little day And now he walking home grinning
And me I’m Barefoot but I ain’t tripping I enjoy giving
Feeling like French Montana
I ain’t worried bout nothing No no no no
Hold up Wait up Move back
Something special bout the boy they be asking who dat
And you know they call the boy Dee Uno
Let the crew know I’m to focus to fail it’s crucial

Been around the world and I I I
Know you think you fly but I’m flya
Know you think your high but I’m highya
Come and take a (?) of this fiya

Get right get right
Cause I done OD’ed on life
This what cha look like
Look like look like
When you done OD’ed on life
