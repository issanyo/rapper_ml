[Intro]
Every day's a beautiful day, every day's a beautiful day
Every day's a beautiful day, every day's a beautiful day
Every day's a beautiful day, every day's a beautiful day

[Verse 1]
I been on my grind all the time in the studio trying to get my mind right
Superstar superstitions got me dancing in my highlights moonwalking like Mike
Finesse the game like Mike tongue down on my Nikes
I'm strung down on this life
It's that dopamine that dopamine giving out life, it's the blind man sight
It's the wisdom that teach them that everything's alright
When hopes and dreams go left we gotta bring them back right
When everybody leave their [?] we gotta stand and fight
When it rains it pours, i'm never running inside
No rain, coat or umbrella could cover up my pride
I die for what I believe in
Work hard for all things that I achieve in
If I leave, don't cry don't be grieving
Cause I gave it my all through each season, no fleeing
Stood strong with my flaws, my rhymes and reason
Stay woke like Khelani's top hand
Never take molly or pop xan
God body 'til they dig six feet and my body dropped in
I'll be highly locked in
Word to the blood underneath my skin
If I never [?] every battle I'm in

[Chorus]
Live life, stay humble
My people, we royal
Young kings, my reign
Deep through my veins
Every day, new region
No problems, don't need them
They want sum' different now
Show you the difference now

[Verse 2]
I got it brackin with my niggas
Popped the bottles pop the swishes
Still riding deep dishes
Still pull up [?] these niggas
It's all business 'til a hater interfere
Friends gone 'til the money reappear
Think we on the same level 'til I'm in the lair
First class with jet lag, I be in the clear (in the clear)
Not a sound up here
Above the clouds where the sounds original
I got my weight up like the pounds on a digital
And I ain't coming down I swear
I be kicking rhymes most times without no swears
I keep it divine and seep life in ears
So ahead of my time I beat light in years
In front of these niggas
I profit my style is
Something religious [?] the law
The law forgive them
If i'm speeding like the cars I've driven
I'm tryna slow down and refocus vision
But never dumbing down these fucking lyrics
I am King, so kill all that pre-notion business
No potion no magic, this is God given
You are now all witness to the God in them
You are now all witness to the God in em

[Chorus]
Live life, stay humble
My people, we royal
Young kings, my reign
Deep through my veins
Every day, new region
No problems, don't need them
They want sum' different now
Show you the difference now

(Beautiful day,Beautiful day
Every day is a beautiful day
Beautiful day, Beautiful day)

[Chorus]
Live life, stay humble
My people, we royal
Young kings, my reign
Deep through my veins
Every day, new region
No problems, don't need them
They want sum' different now
Show you the difference now
