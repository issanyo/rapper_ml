[Verse 1: Stalley]
All this money on my mind
All time I've been minding my business
Haters disguising their friendships
I see through all that fake shit
I'm running thin on my patience
But Imma keep running towards greatness
All these obstacles I'm faced with
All these blessings, I'm gracious
Can't be blinded by darkness
With all these god damn diamonds
I used to live with no lights on
So now I'm god damn shining
(?) with 180 spokes
That's how I be god damn sliding
House for my mom and my sister
Is how the money get divided
Make sure my kids go private
Private jet, my own pilot
Private island, I'm a pirate
And didn't have to use a pyrex
I'm a genius, mad scientist
Smoke the weed for my sinuses
All the straps got silencers
I'm adding up no minuses
Paper trending in the right direction
I build a house off a mixtape
Now its clean blunts like the (?)
The car top slingshot
The rings chop like a switchblade
None of my niggas is bitch made
Hustle hard 'til the rent's paid
Now bow to God and your sensei

[Hook: Stalley]
Allahu akbar, shiny new car
Now shine like the star that we know that you are
Thirty chains you shining too hard
Came all from me so I'm thanking you God

[Verse 2: Stalley]
True blessings, Chevy 2 S's
Super sports, I (?) Teslas
With the gull wings
Giant Elliot on my drawstrings
I'm flossing
(?) 350 V2
V12 in my new coupe
Back yard full court hoop
Playing horse with the Cavaliers
Mini-mansion, my stones dancing
Shining bright like chandaliers
Through many years I shed some tears
Now its gold grills when I'm smiling
Patek Phillipe my wrists
Phillip Childs my dish
Louis Chanel my chick
That 'rari came with no mileage
Got blessings, blessings on blessings
Learn a lesson, teach a lesson
The game, the streets I'm professin'
Wisdom shared worth more than gold
Not flexing
I let evil thoughts penetrate my mind
Now exit
I was around dark people who wouldn't let me shine
So I left it
God said in time he would give me shine
So I read it
He said you're my son, and you're so divine
With a message
From the beginning you was put here to win
Oh my god that's some leverage
Don't ever mistake it, you put here for greatness
That's destined

[Hook: Stalley]
Allahu akbar, shiny new car
Now shine like the star that we know that you are
Thirty chains you shining too hard
Came all from me so I'm thanking you God
