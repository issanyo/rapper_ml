[Hook: Stalley]
I had to hustle to get it
I had to go out and get it
I was home with the junkies
I was in school with the flunkies
I sed to play with them killers
They went from hooping to triggers
I done sold dope to the dealers
(I'm the plug, I'm the plug)

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Big Papi, Stalley Ortiz
Eight ball in my jeans
I ball for my team
Gave all of them rings
It was all just a dream
We was ready to die
Send prayers to the sky
Thank god we alive
Made it to see 25
Some converted to Muslim
Some converted to pushing
They destroy their own people
They sold weed to their brother
Sold crack to their mother
(I hated that struggle)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug

I done sold dope to the dealers
(I'm the plug, I'm the plug)
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
I'm the plug, I'm the plug

[Verse 2: Stalley]
We got targets on our back
Twelve trying to knock us off
Hands up don't shoot
Another tie, another suit
Peel off in the coupe
Got the sauce, got the juice
They don't even see the truth
(They all lost in the sauce though)
Baby mama on the blogs
Baby dad behind the wall
Baby boy in them streets
Gotta hustle just to eat
Lil sis selling pussy
On Instagram for the likes
America never been great
(Cross my heart Donald Trump the anti-Christ)

[Verse 3: Stalley]
Best friend in front of the judge
Twenty years for conspiracy
Tamir's killer got acquitted
(I don't think y'all hear me)
The projects just a project
Black boy just an object
Sometimes a choice really ain't a choice
So we back to scraping out the Pyrex
(808 Mafia)
Scrape, scrape, scrape
Scrape, scrape, scrape
