[Chorus]
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend
For the, for the weekend
For the, for the weekend
For the, for the weekend

[Verse 1]
Fifty racks stuffed in my jeans
Your shorty coming with me
She bringing all of her friends
They wanna ball with the team
I gave all of 'em contracts
I picked them up in the draft
I sell them all in the race
I took them out as the ref
Upgrade, upgrade you baby
Fendi, Balmain, designer crazy
All these fancy girls designer crazy
I'll pay you ain't signed her baby
Blue strip honeys
This all young money
Still spending old money, get booked and
Start showing money

[Chorus]
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend

[Verse 2]
Sippin' act like cold comin'
Sniffin' [?] got that nose runnin'
Floatin' I'm high off the weed
VIP full of them thieves
[?] under my sleeve
I got 12 under my feet
Niggas salary ain't shit to me, I can spend that in a week
Walk in the club with a pack on me
Back to back blowing that gas on me
Don't pass me no benji I pass on it
Nothing on credit draw cash on it
Brown paper bags, foreign paper texts
Turn the suite to a afterparty, 6 am we just getting started

[Chorus]
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend
Pour out a side of my drink
I'll let this run in my sink
I will just order my link
Fuck what these niggas they think
I'm really falling like blink
All of my niggas they eatin'
We got a suite at four seasons
We turnin' up for the weekend
For the, for the weekend
For the, for the weekend
For the, for the weekend
