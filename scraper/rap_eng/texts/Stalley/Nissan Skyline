[Verse 1: Stalley]
Fresh joint fire the Zippo
Took one long inhale then cracked my window
Cranking that Hard Knock Intro
I was dreaming like Bleek for that new Porsche turbo
Shit I'm trying to come up on ya'll
Get one up on ya'll
And when ya'll run up best beleive I'm gon' brawl
I die about mines don't let disrespect be your cause
From the bottom I clawed to 100K in my drawer
Covered by Stan's socks, jubilee band watch
Stuntin' cause I can't stop
Doin' niggas dirty like I was playing in the sand box
Pop, knot, swing Daytons out the chop shop
Drop top, 2 girls with me
One brunette, one got a blond top
I'm beating up the block like a midwest gangster
Chucking deuces to the haters
Saluting my foes twisting fingers
Thug niggas to the ankles
Tell a friend simp
Won't change for no paper
This the culture that I came with

[Hook: PJK]
OOh this the life I relied on
These sides got lines
(?) and chrome on wheels
Hoppers on my dick cause a nigga so chill
For real
Smoking trees grabbin' pine
These sides got lines
Pull' up on niggas with my hand on my gun
Slidin' through the city candy Ford thirty-one

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Coming of age fresh out my adolescence
It was all won, suitcase, mics on
Three finger ring, I had the name John
I was flexin' on the city that's how my name rung
Doc and Donny, a few niggas I got game from
Young theives I was a savage in the streets
Respected by many, hated by least
Cars was never leased
Kept chrome in the seats
Rule number one when you playing in these streets
Stick by that code or get laid under sheets
I was draped in diamonds
Gold laying on my teeth
Weed in my leaf
Blowing big like a chief
Posted on (?) with wig splitters next to me
Gravediggers in the flesh, made money off the steps
Traphouse behind the fence
All Chevrolets (?)
I came from nothing
So its nothing on me to floss these whips
Laugh at a hater
How you think I was supposed to leave

[Hook]
