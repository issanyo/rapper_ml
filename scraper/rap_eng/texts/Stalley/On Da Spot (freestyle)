[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I blow this money like you never seen it
Felony flow you niggas is misdemeanor
When I was broke I used to walk I had a rich demeanor
Shirley said I make that pussy wet that bitch Katrina
Last week I blew like 20 for the hell of it
Bloodhound I find that money just from smelling it
Pick your drug of choice, bet you I was selling it
Addicted to that money, roll a 100 start a hell in it
What! Im burning paper like im Wiz Khalif
And and if you niggas can afford it I bet i'll get cheap
You know the feeling when you burn a 100 in a week
Turn a nigga out just like the first time when you hit a freak

[Verse 2: Pill]
I tell them MMG Bitch or go rocks
Im slick as a witch doctor
Slick as a pick-it-pocketer
You can call me doctor
You know drop top stops
You the Top on my motherfucking beam drop
A nigga in the quick seam with the tape around it
You know the hate surround it
When I come around it they scope and gouge it
Tell them niggas go ahead, faces astounded
Yeah, Im so fresh that im damn near clear
Light up the blunt, please hand me a beer
Understand that a Grammy is near
But I can take the stress
And I just hate when i put the 30 up to chest
Im so off the top my brain and my hair is leaving the top of my head
I'll leave a nigga dead in the bed, call him drop-dead-Fred
They better call the feds till im fed
I gotta' get my money
Niggas is smiling like this shit is funny
Im a smart ass nigga not a dummy
Run with me or run from me
Im bout' my motherfucking paper
Chasing after these niggas like some haters
That just stole it, I just stole it
Gotta' grab the ball then console them
Families, after that they like "Aw man God damn he be on some real shit"
Roaches, Ferocious shit
And after that I go and get yo bitch and get my cock sucked
And guarantee a nigga fuck with me he popped up
I'll leave his brain gone, I'll leave his mane gone
And I will leave that nigga whole family name on a plate in the front of a suitcase
That's in front of a cemetery, you won't chase me
Because it's off safety
Shout out to my nigga Gunplay he is on par of the gang
And a part of my name spells "ruthless"
I'll leave a pussy nigga toothless
I come up around the B.I.G. niggas
Them keep that heat niggas they real, just like me
Niggas, they wanna' see a real G
I guarantee them motherfuckers gonna' feel me
They wanna' come and see how real that Pill be
And if they wanna stop me they gotta' kill me

[Verse 3: Stalley]
From the Jets to the Penthouse
Synonymous to what my life been bout'
Kinetic energy, brain waves of intelligence is what I send out
Still in the cut doing spin outs
87 boxed up, all tinted out
Living life on the edge
Couple links that excite the Feds
Shout to Mr. Jones
It's funny how sparkling stones bring attention from these hater heads
A lot of changing faces from these Potato heads
Eyes Dilated when I sashay lifted, couple doobies in the ash tray
Cash Clay run my mouth like a swimming champion
The long bed has the pain I be dancing in
They reign with pharaohs, mirror image to the gods
My holy glory brings head nods
The only story I been bout, is control mine with no facade
The Dreaming Intuition from the streets, polititional scar
Back and forth with the pimp and gang symbolist, dope boys with the bang in their trunk
Semen tremblers, Milk City where im from with the O.B. emblems
Streets named after Indians
So wild cowboys watch where you coming in
Tomahawks with assault rifles
May Bumpin' to the next kingpin
Civil with the spiritual, the city feel
