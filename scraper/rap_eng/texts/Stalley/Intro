[Intro: Stalley]
It's like, it feels like Days of Thunder
And I'm Tom Cruise, you know what I'm saying?
Speeding through, man
Ohio with the, uh
Aight!

[Verse 1: Stalley]
All you niggas' days is numbered
I'm speeding past niggas, Days of Thunder
Tom Cruise, been bombin' crews since the pager numbers
Lumberjack brown tats, started jackin' with the gold up under
A dope boy without selling dope, twist a tree, inhale the smoke
Money the colour of Cuban coke
Cuban chains and gold ropes, black flags, black locs
Triple gold Dayton spokes, triple stacks pourin' fo'
Rubber band, my stacks is dough, this is old money from '94
Buckets, no bench seats when I roll
I roll my windows down and turn the music up
Hit the switch and drop it low
808s and tons of low end
And light another one, this made the smoke end
Don't hop yo' ass in if you ain't down to roll in (Roll in)
'Cause they don't understand that shining bright
They can't understand this kind of life
When you sittin' clean behind halogen lights
They start throwin' Hollows out of spite, tryin' to take your life
I came from the wrong side of the tracks
Trying to make it right
When they turn white to green
Young niggas turn to fiends at fifteen
Wiggled out, shooting AR-15s and Glock nines
Bullet holes in every stop sign
Ignore cop signs, they kill one of us? Then a cop dyin'
Drop-top riding, middle finger to the wind
And I keep poppin' iron 'til all my niggas win
And every nigga with me sittin' on gold rim
Been wanting that since Maximums with the gold trim
My dog's been in all gold before the gold trend
Dead stock Jordan 10s, orange juice and Seagram's gin
Turned onto all of that before the age of ten
Fluffy leaves on that green stem gettin' rolled up
A nigga come from another city, he get fold up
And girls with they nose up, acting like they ain't slut
White boys get they nose stuffed with that pure uncut
Man, this world where I'm living at
That's why I rap through these songs down to my Fifty cap
I said, this world where I'm living at
That's why I rap through these songs down to my Fifty cap
To my Fifty cap
So raw where I'm living at
Fifty
