[Verse 1: ST 2 Letta]
Ghetto revolutionary
People say the truth is scary
So we hide behind lies like Santa Claus and tooth fairies
But I must admit it's been a few
Since I had money under my pillow or presents in my living room
So I stick and move, shuck and jive
Make my little money, take my little money
And flip that shit a couple times
Cause it’s either the Matrix or the cages
Try to escape and they giving you calendar pages
But my mind state is similar to Ace’s
Get paid in full, but still try to remain faceless
Famous, addicted once you taste it
The music started pure and then somebody laced it
Now this shit is tainted and I don't even want it like I used to
Stressed out, drop a couple Xanax in my fruit juice
Cause I been having nightmares of being broke at thirty
Can't sleep, that's why I'm in New York so early

[Verse 2: Yung Clova]
I'm the man that paint the picture, black history huh
And all these seeds that I planted, what they did ma
Yeah they must be, I made it past 25
The lifestyle I'm living, minimum wage won't buy a fucking tie
If I'm flexing, god damnit I deserve this shit
And I'm just trying to ball hard on that Oprah(?) shit
Maybe I'm Jay or Kanye, watch the throne nigga
Maggots to a giant, I'm that king nigga
These boys bisex, they worried about they triceps
Me I'm on an island fishing for (?)
Fuck the wealth when they struggling to breathe they last breath
And all you dream about is how the fuck Clova stay fresh
Extravagant, my life is not perfect huh
Mona Lisa at her greatest, they compare us huh
I'm in the middle of the ocean, ain't no drowning me
My life is not a circus, ain't no way you bitches clowning me
Gettin' it

[Verse 3: Stalley]
Man, I ain't close to wary
Cause living where I'm from is more than eerie
16th and Harsh Ave up posted early, gettin' it
Life moving fast, feels like we ain't living it
As fast as money comes, the faster we spending it
Riding around on Nationals
Machine guns and extended clips
Looking for a come up, these young guns ain't befriending ish
They hop out, shoot your block out, then they go and cruise the strip
That's backyard Midwest music ish
Bump and let that trunk get bit, we gettin' it
Showing off while we gettin' it
That black ish, shoving money in that matress
Or backflips off that matress
I'm back with them dirty kids who end up getting 40 years off that crack ish
See I clash with my past, it's amazing how I made it out that trap kid
Gettin' it
Niggas said it's my turn, now I'm gettin' it
