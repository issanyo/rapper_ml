Hercules... elevate

[Verse 1]
Rap warlord stay on point, like a scoreboard
Coming to get everything I worked for
Never been a church boy, but always knew god
Played the game hard never took nothing lightly
Stumbled any nigga trying to fight me, I'm not the push over type see
I will come back with thunder and lightning
Played under rain storms, hard times I came from
It's hot on your side
Well nigga its the same sun
Hustle from the same bag, delivery is A-1
I ain't never lost one cent, stolen crumb
I'm back on my herc ish
Lion skin, gnarled club, that's what I'm working with
Stronger than you other kids, wide eyed lids
Focused on my weight gain, Lou Ferrigno chisel man
Ain't nothing really changed, I'm just cleaning up now
Tossing out you weaklings, c-c-coming for you haters
I hear everything you speaking
Raps like high school
Thats why I dropped out I rather do home school
I better not around you, lames be the downfall
To a wise leader and a good friend
I step away before I let you niggas kill my legend
Ain't a blood type to specimen like him
I must be

(Sample)
Hercules
I must be Hercules
Her-Hercules
I must be Hercules
I must, I must
