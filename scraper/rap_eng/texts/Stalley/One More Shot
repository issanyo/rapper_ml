[Hook: August Alsina]
Take one more shot for the liquor, a little more liquor
And we on that bullshit
Yeah, one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot after shot, now we got a whole clip
Got my G's right, yeah my G's right
Keep sipping like it’s free tonight
Got money, power, respect, the keys in life
If you’re free tonight, yeah my keys are right here
Take one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot, shot

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Ohio State, great kicks, hottest nigga on the block
Take another shot, now we on our bullshit
Need a couple bottles to the VIP
And 6 more shots if we through then we on a full clip
Party over here, party next door
Party on the dance floor, damn little shawty too thick
Took her from a ball player, wasn’t playing ball
I ain’t really get involved, I ain’t give two shits
Ladies everywhere, kush in the air, already lit two spliffs
She don’t even smoke like that, got her faded back off two hits
And the club full throttle while you babysitting bottles, ain't take two sips
She know what it is, I ain’t gotta place a bid, all you gotta let me know is when you’re ready to dip but first

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take one more shot for the liquor, a little more liquor
And we on that bullshit
Yeah, one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot after shot, now we got a whole clip
Got my G's right, yeah my G's right
Keep sipping like it’s free tonight
Got money, power, respect, the keys in life
If you’re free tonight, yeah my keys are right here
Take one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot, shot

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Marijuana still lit, hottest label in the game
Sitting on my chain, I ain’t gotta prove it
Ciroc shots, black bottle Belaire
Fresher than the Fresh Prince, hell yeah boy I do this
We just tryna party, I ain’t tryna hurt nobody
But my nigga got the hammer on him like a tool kit
And girl I got the keys whenever you wanna leave
Old school in the lot looking like a new whip
First you wanna pic for the ‘Gram, damn, paws gon’ be on me like I gotta new chick
Twisting in the club going HAM, man, shawty’s so bad I done took two flicks
Bunch of bad women in the club, love, something bout you girl it’s just too slick
Take another shot just because cause, a nigga feeling buzzed, I ain’t tryna lose it

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take one more shot for the liquor, a little more liquor
And we on that bullshit
Yeah, one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot after shot, now we got a whole clip
Got my G's right, yeah my G's right
Keep sipping like it’s free tonight
Got money, power, respect, the keys in life
If you’re free tonight, yeah my keys are right here
Take one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot, shot

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Parking lot and my top down, never turning my ‘Pac down
Me against the world and a bag of weed, couple real niggas repping that BCG
Black bottle, my game plan, VIP like Gangland
My new bitch, she look Asian and these hating ass niggas ain’t phasing
Fly nigga, Ricky Teabag, fly with me shawty, come see the world
Wake up everyday to connect the dots, my homie making rounds fresh out the box
And my new spot bigger than the Fox, speaking outta deal, all the bad bitches meet us
Extra deluxe, tryna keep your feet up, all black Visa, buying out the bar

[Hook: August Alsina]
Take one more shot for the liquor, a little more liquor
And we on that bullshit
Yeah, one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot after shot, now we got a whole clip
Got my G's right, yeah my G's right
Keep sipping like it’s free tonight
Got money, power, respect, the keys in life
If you’re free tonight, yeah my keys are right here
Take one more shot for the liquor, just a little more liquor
Shot, shot
