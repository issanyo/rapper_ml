Ohio, I’ve been scraped the pavement throughout natural sevens
Picking 50’s of the floor, trying to collect the sevens
Cause it’s the streets that I eat from
Doc and Donny and them is who I learn from
So each one teach one that’s the cigarillos burn from
The seats of my 68 camaro with the skiny front
Ride with me through my city once
And be inspired how we give it up
Fast talkin’ pimp walkin’ how we live it up
Hustler spirit sound anything you give to us, trust
We ain’t come from much, so it’s in us to double up
2 pairs and new heads when we rush
For the love of mink coats and rings with the sharpest cuts
Militant minds all the time though
Trying to balance that thin line of freedom and dough
Keep a clean song let the dice roll with the good times
Cause if you gonna gamble might as well on this life
So shake ’em up, shake ’em up with me
Grab your red cups fill ’em up with me
And come through this south east side and get this milk money
See I make my money with the dice, shake ’em up, double up, triple up, twice
I made enough
Round here, that’s what we call life
Live it up, drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block, so player make a hater want job
See rhyme saves get the paper you can shop
Bags fill ’em up, credit card bill ’em up
A roll of weed loose communicate with every few
After what’s the use overlooking the project view
Penthouse dreams, large tips for my bellman
Reality is fiends… drops in my shelter
You decide what stay alive that be crucified
40 dollar for my crucifix jeweler do or die
Real niggers wanna shout, live it up
Dice game here, crack a six, triple up
Any question and I’m with it, time to go and get it
Looking at the Rolle, mother proud made a visit
It’s a cold world, mama made me frigid
Niggers getting’ money, I’m living interest
My team running screen, Derek Rose at the point
… blow never know, time to blow the joint
See I make my money with the dice, shake ’em up, double up, triple up, twice
I made enough
Round here, that’s what we call life
Live it up, drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block, so player make a hater want job
See rhyme saves get the paper you can shop
Bags fill ’em up, credit card bill it up
I perfected the come up, hustle harder than most
Stack papers til it wrinkled and mold
They said you ain’t getting it until them dollars don’t fall
So I ain’t ever relax, head crack after head crack
My approach is leave with it all, go spend that and bend back and do it again
Such a rush when it’s all or nothing, dice flicking in your hand
Everything is hittin’ got you feeling you the man
Such an awesome zone to be in
I recline when the pressure’s on the… more for the starters, I took the first stone
My cost home had me nurturing my first poem, then I decided throwing everything I worked for
Cause I was racing but it all felt dirt slow
Miles away from millionaires felt closer with each throw
If you’re not willing to put it all in, then what you came fo’
Scared money don’t make money, a broke mouth can’t speak for me
Talk it sheep I’ve been all in, let’s get money
Talk it sheep I’ve been all in, let’s get money
A broke mouth can’t speak for me
See I make my money with the dice, shake ’em up, double up, triple up, twice
I made enough
Round here, that’s what we call life
Live it up, drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block, so player make a hater want job
See rhyme saves get the paper you can shop
Bags fill ’em up, Credit card bill it up
