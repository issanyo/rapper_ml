[Hook: Stalley]
Life's golden I be rolling up expensive shit
Everybody always talking what they finna get
Shit I'm getting rich with niggas I been sinning with
Same niggas I was with playing Genesis
Madden 96, '96 Impalas
Street scholars, sold dope through college
We was trying to stack dollars fuck through the knowledge
Word to mamas, ran the streets like Rottweilers

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Hard headed with car fetish
We'll toss a nigga for raw lettuce
Trying to see a thousand islands
Passport crazy mileage
Cigarette boats on the Cayman Islands
Bad Malaysian eating Cajun (?)
Bumping Sizzla at crazy volumes
Ride, cry, Mai-tai, (?)
Smoke until my eyes Chinese
Pepper pot Guyanese
Everything exquisite to the 95 Nikes
Put it all on periscope for live feed
I see the maturation of a king
Rolex match the ring
That's player shit
Tom Ford aviators raising shit
Saint Laurents latest shit
I'm draped in it
Up a mill and a half
Yah I made a bit

[Hook: Stalley]
Life's golden I be rolling up expensive shit
Everybody always talking what they finna get

Same niggas I was with playing Genesis

We was trying to stack dollars fuck through the knowledge
Word to mamas, ran the streets like Rottweilers

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Lost fathers of prison systems we been a victim
Mama evicted, we been restricted to product pitchin'
Products of our environments, that's how the projects got us
Pyrex vision we  rock solid
Killing our own people to rock diamonds
Real tyrants on skinny tires
Drug suppliers turned rap rhymers
Taught the country in Path Finders, God guide us
Its hard to get a grip with arthritis
Diamonds dripping like bad sinus
Money up, money down that's a plus minus
Some will smile, some will frown depending on how they find us
Some will love you, most will hate you, that's how they designed us
