[Verse 1]
Everybody's motto pop a bottle
Freak a model f- tomorrow, fuck tomorrow
Live for the day, do drugs it'll help with the pain
Being a junkie is the new cool ish
Or carry automatics long as pool sticks
Niggas really don't want beef unless it come from roof crips
Loose lips ain't saying nothing
Whole bunch of gun bars but ain't spraying nothing
I swear niggas stay fronting
But who am I to talk about it?
Let niggas hang themselves who am I to talk 'em out it?
The coup√© white, the rims powdered , I stunt too
It's odd in this war Stalley sons zoo
I got knowledge in this bag I can front you
Ain't no talking to my bag I'll confront you
A real one all the real ones come run to
I drop jewels like 47th and 6th
Or get real gangster and 86 your shit

[Hook]
So let's talk about it, money
Let's talk about it, diamonds
Let's talk about it, diamonds
Let's talk about it, women
Everybody wanna talk about it, envy
Let's talk about it, hate
Everybody wanna talk about it

[Verse 2]
I can care less about your money goals
I'm ten toes in a Rolls
Sitting on four 4gs, my life gordy
I been balling like Asian Jeweler
Every joint long as a metric ruler
I flex, Lex Luther
You flex you still a loser, what a drag
No comparison, I'm Micky Arison with the bag
I'm on South Beach lobster and crab
Joe Stones with millionaire blacks
It's a blessing what I made from these tracks
Never take it for granted
Granted I been the man
Since I seeped through them cracks
Beautiful Rolls with the prick lease
How I made it this should be on Ripley's, believe it or not
Ain't gon' stop 'til I'm leaving on top
One mission I'm something different
Money don't drive me, I steer from the heart
Loving condition, a blueprint to a millionaire start

[Hook]
Now let's talk about it, money
Everybody wanna talk about it, success
Talk about it let's talk about it, diamonds
Everybody wanna talk about it, women
Talk about it let's talk about it, envy
Everybody wanna talk about it, hate
Talk about it let's talk about it, me
Now everybody wanna talk about it
