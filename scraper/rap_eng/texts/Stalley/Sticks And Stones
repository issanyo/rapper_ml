[Verse 1: Stalley]
No weapons formed against me shall prosper
You can hate, but I shall prosper
I came from Ramen to shell pasta
Stayed positive without being a shell popper
Been a hip hopper since Run was a shell topper
Papa said ''stay of the streets unless your bell proper''
This society is a monster
It'll shoot you up and hunt ya for being yourself
Cause people hate what they can't conquer
The streets is like contra
Dramatized like opera, [?] and scream
Tearing out your dreams, they'll hunt ya
Throwing bullets and bombing your hood
Propaganda escape through the ganja
You can't take what they honor
And that's loyalty and honesty which always been a part of me
So pardon me if nothing you do harms me
Gonna need more than sticks and stones and an army to stop me
I'm not afraid of your criticism or threats, you copy?

[Hook: Rashad]
Darts and needles, bow and arrows
Ain't no weapon that can stop us now
Sticks and stones, bombs and bullets
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore

[Verse 2: Stalley]
(Now I look at all my doubters and laugh)
I escaped all the doubt
Took the road less traveled and made my way out
Took chances, I ain't know how my life would play out
Used to sit back in my granny's house in my playhouse
Dream about the big stage way before the mixtapes
And everybody would say it would never happen
And you would never see the world beyond Massillon
Some people leave and fall right back in this trap and
Get stuck here, no luck here - that's just facts, man
That small town story they don't wanna hear, they want action
Guns blasting, jewelry flashing
And your music's full of passion
Which is wrong when you're rapping
But now I'm touring when I'm rapping overseas
Seeing things I never could imagine
Even in that playhouse my dreams never played out
The way my life has
Goals I accomplished in past
Now I look at all my doubters and laugh

[Hook: Rashad]

[Verse 3: Stalley]
They said the first shall be last and the last shall be first
They listen to every word so be patient in your verse
And to get your point across you don't even gotta curse
If God curse the unspiritual may he bless the most lyrical
Used to think I had to rap gangster to play in stereo
Grew up on C-Bo, also a scenario
So my conscience in the middle
Right next to [?] played Tony when I was little
Montana, gun handles with bandannas out the window
Afraid to play outside, but life ain't what you live for
It's more about putting life into your kinfolk
So don't worry about who's rich or been broke
Just write until your pen broke and then write it in blood
With slit veins until you pour out all of the love
Now that's thug
An honest man lend an honest hand help a struggled man up
So what?

[Outro: Rashad](Stalley)
I'm not afraid anymore
(Afraid to say what I felt
Afraid to tell my story and be myself)
I'm not afraid anymore
(Afraid to be loved and afraid to love myself)
I'm not afraid anymore
(Used to hide from the hate
Used to run and try to hide my face)
