[Hook]
All my niggas make that ridah music
So us gangsters gon' keep riding to it
Nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it
As long as I keep making ridah music
All these real ones they gon' ride to it

All my niggas make that ridah music
So us gangsters gon' keep riding to it
Nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it
As long as I keep making ridah music
All these real ones they gon' ride to it

Nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it

[Verse 1]
A nigga flossing in that coupe
Windows down, my music loud
AC blowing smoking Black 'n Milds
A nigga pull up on my then I back him down
That machine in my seat got a hundred rounds
I slide through the jungle, call it my hunting grounds
I'm from the streets where the monsters lurkin'
All my hoes got vests 'cause them llama squirtin'
Tatted tears I'm facing a lot of hurtin'
That's why I drink in cars and do a lot of skrt
(?) jerkin'
Spin tires and my rims perfect
I drive a Chevy like its Daytona
V12 engine big block rollin'
Got a bad chick she my (?)
Smoking back to back like (?)

[Hook]
All my niggas make that ridah music
So us gangsters gon' keep riding to it
Nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it
As long as I keep making ridah music
All these real ones they gon' ride to it

They say nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it

[Verse 2]
I'm speeding past my old life in this new whip
The same color as French dip
My lady holding a J between her French tips
Midwest I'm on some pimp shit as usual
Futuristic on some new shit as usual
You talking bad I'm like who is you
I'm supreme, Lafayette Street original
Never called a cop you on point
No bars is sloppy on point
I get dressed and hop out dipping
All they do is point
The king here, my dream clear
BCG, very rare
Build for trap, sweat and tears out in the basement
I claimed it, (?) is what I named it
Allah told me to move gracious
So far, that's how I'm riding this (?)
That candy gliding on stars
That's why I blaze sitting sideways so raw
Fifteens in my trunk beating hard
23's on the whip, 23's on the car
Jumpman, jumpman, jumpman, that's what the switches do to the car
Out the window (?)
Watch over me oh lord
All these boppers, haters, lames F 'em all
Ride

[Hook]
All my niggas make that ridah music
So us gangsters gon' keep riding to it
Nigga make that ridah music
So all my niggas can keep riding to it
As long as I keep making ridah music
All these real ones they gon' ride to it
