It don’t mean nothing if it don’t mean something so you don’t mean nothing to me
Stepping out with my lady and she from the 80’s but the car made in ‘73
And we going super…hard
They can hear the sound when we came down
‘cus the bass was banging…hard…hard

(Verse 1)
A fistful of dollars, my folk overcoat, black onyx on the wrist, car full of smoke
Simply in the cup holder, only sip from Styrofoam the red cups when I poke
Chevelle a goona with 100 spoakes, leaning out the side logo on the front bumper looking like a bowtie
Headlights crosseyed, paint job doofie, top t’d off yeah that’s just how the roof be
Midwest getting it ‘cus that’s where all the loot be, blue collar gang hustle game like dope weed, cowboy docey, in the chevy with the alligator apolstree, slow so they notice me
Bruh I’m getting it, I don’t hear what haters shout, deuces I be chucking out system loud coming down
They know when I be stepping out, the city get extra riled up, funny how one man could shut the crowd up

(hook)
It don’t mean nothing if it don’t mean something so you don’t mean nothing to me
Stepping out with my lady and she from the 80’s but the car made in ‘73
And we going super…hard
They can hear the sound when we came down
‘cus the bass was banging…hard…hard

(Verse 2)
Everything I do is classic, so it’s natural to me, Light up any room I step in
The Malcolm X of the social scene, power might influence millions off one site and
‘cus what I’m writing what these kids put they life in
I give them hope through the days so they nights blend
See I shine and you other niggas quiet them
So you don’t mean nothing ‘cus you don’t mean something aight then
Now back to me steppin' out my lady brought her Giuseppe’s out David Yurman necklace and a Miu Miu blouse and we truly truly out
Go so hard when we leave the house, stars when you moving clouds
Shining out these goofy crowds trying to keep up with us but we kick dust with us when we leave out
So you need not be ‘round ‘cus we shut down anything we be ‘round when we hit town and go hard

(hook)
It don’t mean nothing if it don’t mean something so you don’t mean nothing to me
Stepping out with my lady and she from the 80’s but the car made in ‘73
And we going super…hard
They can hear the sound when we came down
‘cus the bass was banging…hard…hard
