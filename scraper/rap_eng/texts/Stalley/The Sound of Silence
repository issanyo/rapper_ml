[Intro: (Sample) Man 1 & Man 2]
Man 1: [ inaudible]...I wanna know what's the relation
Between cars and bass?

Man 2: I-I-I-it depends on your trunk space...
Depends on...what kind of car you have. Um...

Man 1: Cause some people are smart...?

Man 2: Yeah. Ah...some people when they don't have...
A big enough car, they'll use their whole back seat for a box--
The back seat and the trunk
So...It just all depends...
((...all depends,..all depends))
(echoes & fades out)

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Glassback roof. Ground effects kit
Fiberglass enclosure, sub-woofers: 15 inches
Prowling through the "Milq". '73 Caprice
Two-tone blue--black pinstripes: 350 engine
Dual flow-masters, swisher-sweets getting twisted
Blasting out old tunes--
Trying to match the music with my new views
Looking at the the world different lately--
I just wanna take care of the lady that made me
Honestly that same motive is driving me crazy
Feel the pressure through the bucket seats
A lot of death wishes but it's always the same ones...
That end up loving me
It's puzzling putting together pieces
Demon-days be coming in with snakes and leaches--
The garden of the boulevard:
Trying to duck the bullet large
Straight aces--trying to play the cards I've been dealt
To only come to grips that I've been playing by myself...

[Hook: ( Portuguese Sample)]
*"...Que ia ser melhor depois
Você queria ser
O grande herói das estradas
Tudo que você queria ser"*

(Translation)
"...You want to be
The great hero of the roads
Everything you wanted to be"

[Verse 2: Stalley]
A black hole for a dusty soul
And 14 inch red-lines for that dusty road
I spin a globe and place my finger on it:
Where ever it stops it's the next place I'm owning--
I'm on it
Still journeying with tight boats
A leather journal filled with life quotes
Got a whole lot of living--
Still my life's a movie with words with a vivid real:
The last real nigga out--
You should try and build...
A catalog like mine
Ain't a lotta like mines:
That's why I'm always *'uno'* on my grind
Small circle short tolerance for dummies that try and climb...
The mountain I define: I communicate like a mime
With middle fingers and a straight face
So I hope you getting my...sentiments to your life
Actions speak many words--
No need to read between the lines
Just watch: suggestion; as I pass by--
This brilliant world of mine

[Hook: ( Portuguese Sample)]
*"Com sol e chuva você sonhava
Que ia ser melhor depois
Você queria ser
O grande herói das estradas
Tudo que você queria ser"*

(Translation)
"With sun and rain you dreamed
What would be better then
You want to be
The great hero of the roads
Everything you wanted to be"

[Outtro: Stalley]
