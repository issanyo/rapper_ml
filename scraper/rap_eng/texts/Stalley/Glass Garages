[Intro]
Get that sure feeling in the '67 cars from Chevrolet

Let me put it this way
If you have a new car, like this new Impala
With its bold, impressive, modern look
You'd hate to hide it in an ordinary garage right?

[Verse 1]
All these cars come cash paid
And all of them grownups, they come with ash trays
From the '87 Cutlass to them '68 Stingrays
And you know she came smoke great
Butter seats like Parkay
Brought blades for the '88 Caprice
Suede swivel bucket seats that remind me of my Jeep
You hear me blocks away, It got that monster beat
Girl in my passenger showing cleavage like she works for Twin Peaks
Who this on the dashboard? 220 when I mash on
Panoramic roof look like a glass backboard
This is all I asked for
You gettin' in? Wipe your feet before, don't touch the stereo
And buckle up when you sit in
This '68 Chevrolet come from the era of the sit-in
I play that triple black and nicknamed it Huey Newton
Black Panther on wheels, giving white women chills
They call it revolutionary cruisin'

[Hook]
Twenty acres of land, one big brick mansion
Backyard all sand
The nerve of them
To ever ask me what I rap for
I just smile and tell them
"Garages with the glass doors"

[Verse 2]
King of the car top
That Monty SS with the bars bought
That was mixtape money wasn't the funny part
354 bought, got it off Saladin, my Muslim cold heart
First times I laid eyes on it, it stole my heart
(?) for the Linc'
Another one for the Fleet'
Now that's money (?)
I'm like fourteen deep, remember walking sixteenth
Dreaming of riding clean, hoes, and baggy jeans
A hundred miles on my Jordans 13's
That was before the sneaker closets
Glass door garages, Eurotour deposits
I was thinking about robbing all the dope boys and (?)
They was riding around here in foreigns, disrespecting the hood
The first terrorist to come through the jungle
You know around here its American muscle
Pontiacs, Bowties, and Fords get love too
Sedan and the Coupes, Pick-up trucks get stored too

[Hook]
