I don’t care what you say
Ain’t no more playing O-H
Before I see a L
I bet you, you see a K
OK, tec with the beam
Flex when you see ‘em
Yo momma gon’ scream
And all them church folk gon’ scream
Alright, big mouth, big talk
Stretched out, side walk
Chalked out, tal’m bout
My brothers going all out
Outside, riding around in that whip with tints you can’t see in it
My trunk sound like I’m riding around with Lil B in it

Hey, them twenties go for fevers, no lie
Dealers, I need 1-9 for the pie
Hey, no negotiation on the price
I’m hanging up on niggas if they asking why, aye
White women on the snow we call them White Walkers
25 to Life is what this life offer
Little black kids please don’t sell dope
It’s a set up by the government and they know that we know, oh

Hey, all my brothers gone or they caged in
Sometimes I cry and wish I could’ve saved them
Hey, but I’m having trouble tryna save me
Hey, that makes sense we grew up on them same streets

Big chain with the piece
Hoe, I’m finna
Chopping blades on Caprise
Hoe, I’m finna
Hey, things ain’t what they seem
But, I’m finna
Hey, show ‘em I’m a King
Hoe, I’m finna

I’m finna
Say, I’m finna
I’m finna
Hoe, I’m finna
Big chain with the piece
Hoe, I’m finna
Chopping blades on Caprise
Hoe, I’m finna

If your money don’t talk, nigga miss me
Big check in the bank I was 15
They said I wouldn’t make it
My neighborhood was blood
That don’t mean we was related
Music paid me

We use to watch the box when I was 12
Two years later got a record deal
Granny still alive and she proud of me
Shaddy never had to use a scale

I was cool before Middle School
Back when Cooda found me
Ask Puff about me
Your producer studied my interviews
Hang on every line
Can’t a nigga doubt me

Talk like I done this
No more playing Columbus
I might buy back the block
Get Lil Bow Wow to run it
Buy some books for the kids
Grow some food for they stomachs
Finna cop me a station
For all this gas that we pumpin
Pumpin

A lot of weed in my system
Sitting high on suspension
My Rolex they glisten
My Cuban they flickering
That 9 get the whistling
*whistles*

Bullets fly in your biscuit
It’s best not to risk it
Hundred bands in my pocket
I shop like it’s Christmas
My pockets on fitness
This money so frivolous
My Chevy got switches
My girls look like strippers
My trunk shaking richter
I slide with them hitters

I’m finna throw diamonds on the chain
I’m finna
I’m finna bowling ball on my pain
I’m finna
I’m finna stop giving all this game
I’m finna
I’m finna put you rappers all to shame
I’m finna
I’m finna
