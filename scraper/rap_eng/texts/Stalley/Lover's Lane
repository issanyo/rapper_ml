[Verse 1: Stalley]
This be my right to passage
Cold glasses filled with liquor
Cigars packed in
Shorty laughing, weed got her mind goofy
White wine got her loose
Now she trying to do me
Cameras flashing, recorders on, it's turned into a movie
She working for that leading role
I ain't trying to the lead a soul
I get lost on lover's road
End up on misery bouley
Pain can be the biggest bully
Rough you up with head noogies
Always been that bad cookie
Never sweet and never soft
Hard to the f'in core
Seems like I've been here before
So before you get to chasing tears
I'mma run and escape from here
Don't want that type of hate in the air cause that can last for years
Man I done it myself, couldn't forgive or forget
But I wanted the help from the next lady
But the next lady was just as crazy as the previous lady
I was previously in Chevy, reminiscing on each and every
Woman that gave me a headache or turned into some dead weight
Rear view mirror headaches
See them right behind me, started feeling like a car chase
So I'm pushing the speedometer
Pedal to the floor, switch lanes
Don't wanna be here no more

[Hook: Anthony Flammia]
I'm speeding down lover's lane
Must've took the wrong turn
I'm supposed go the other way
The music on blast and I'm running out of gas
And I gotta find this highway
The strawberry lights and they're blocking my sight
Traffic jam on the interstate
Been around the world and I'm looking for my girl
But I'm thinking that it's too late
All these lover's in my lane, all these lover's in my lane
These lover's in my way, these lover's in my way

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Traffic jam packed in this loud pack
Just finished, so I'm looking, where's my Mild at?
Windows slightly cracked, light drizzle outside
Cupid arrows falling on my windshield
It's hard for me to hide
Half hearts and puckered lips falling from the sky
I'm just hoping it's my high
Clear my eyes and focus, it's getting late outside
Delirium with pride, not a good mixture
On my dashboard there's a picture of my lady
Damn I sure miss her or maybe
I'm just lonely baby
I'm feeling slightly crazy, one minute I'm trying to find her
Next minute I wanna run from her, maybe all my time's up
I've been sitting here too long, staring at my passenger seat
Trying to figure out why you gone
My personality too strong, too caught up on who's wrong
Saying you can move on, when I really want you to hold on
That was just me being silly
I just really want you near me
I wish that you could hear me over all these loud engines
I love you and I'm done pretending
This road got me optimistic, not to mention
I seen you following me the whole time, from a distance
