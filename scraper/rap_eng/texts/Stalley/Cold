[Verse 1: Stalley]
I be that topic of discussion, long beard they love him
Lumberjack button to the top
Suede shoes, array of hues on the watch
Time tickin' slower through these boulders growing through these codas
Blue Dream aroma from the pot
My new thing is write and not think a lot
Just jot off the inspiration folk
I can see them hatin' that ain't nothing new though
I seen it before the hublot and that old school two do'
I was just ignorin' it, 5 speed floorin' it
The dream I was explorin' it, tryna live enormous in a farm house
Tall spouse on some S. Thompson ish, wrote a lot of consciousness
Now I'm just mobbin' with the gangsta kids with llamas gripped
Down to protect me if the dramas thick
Kamikaze bomber ish, slash philanthropist
Always speak to God but the Devil they be dancin with
Under the pale moonlight my star trek took flight
So anyone tryna shoot me down, my niggas gon' handle it
Pitch black, one candle lit
Praying for these niggas that wish me bad and can't handle it
I wrote my own manuscript
Follow no rules, nigga I'm cool

[Hook: Stalley]
I'm cooler than the polar bear's toe nails
Oh hell, there he go again
Weed smoke in the wind
15 inch red line spin
Nigga I'm not carin'
About what you talkin' 'bout
Nigga I'm cold
Don't want what you sellin'
Nigga I'm cold
I can put you on the game
But nigga I'm cold
I ain't tryna side with lames
Nigga I'm cold

[Verse 2: Stalley]
They fantasize about my lifestyle
If they could kill me right now for everything I write down
They'd do it no hessy
Now that I found love like the late great heavy
It's a fine line to every, money endeavor
See I been cold no sweater
When I'm locked in and focused I'm a go go getta
I've been told no betta, I'm someone with a vendetta
I ain't lettin up nigga, it's a passion in my heart
Right next to that dark hole that's leadin' to my cold soul
It's all a part of the man that stays sharp, on my P's and Q's
X-ing out you marks, niggas betta dart
When I get to throwin shells like Mario Kart
I'ma either hit ya head or go straight to ya heart
I'm sendin' you off to bed I ain't waitin on dark
And I'll do it myself I ain't waitin on dog
Got the nerves to look at me funny like I'm hatin' on y'all
Like I'm supposed to stand here and take the fall
But Tony told me all I got is my word and my balls
And Scarface told me I was invincible dog, (Ain't I)
