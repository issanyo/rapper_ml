[Verse 1: Stalley]
I be scraping pavement, throw out natural sevens
Picking 50s of the floor trying to collect the severance
Cause it's the streets that I eat from
Doc and Donny and them is who I learn from
So each one teach one that's the cigarillos burn from
The seats of my 68 Camaro with the skinny front
Ride with me through my city once
And be inspired how we give it up
Fast talkin', pimp walkin' how we live it up
Hustler spirit sell anything you give to us, trust
We ain't come from much, so it's in us to double up
Two pairs of new Airs when we brush
For the love of mink coats and rings with the sharpest cuts
Militant minds all the time though
Trying to balance that thin line of freedom and dough
Keep a clean soul, let the dice roll with the good times
Cause if you gon' gamble, might as well on this life
So shake 'em up, shake 'em up with me
Grab your red cups, fill 'em up with me
And come through this south Eastside and get this milk money

[Hook: Stalley]
See I make my money with the dice, shake 'em up
Double up, triple up, twice, I made enough
Round here, that's what we call life, live it up
Drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block
So player, make a hater wanna jock
See rhyme saves, get the paper, you can shop
Bags, fill 'em up, credit card, bill it up

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I roll the weed loose, communicate with every few
After what's the use overlooking the project view
Penthouse dreams, large tips for my bellman
Reality is fiends, rain drops in my shelter
You decide, why stay alive than be crucified
Four thou' for my crucifix, jewelers do or die
Real niggas wanna shout, live it up
Dice game, head crack a six, triple up
Any question and I'm with it, time to go and get it
Looking at the Rollie, mother pearl made a visit
It's a cold world, mama made me frigid
Niggas gettin' money, I'm living interest
My team running screen, Derek Rose at the point
Selling blow, never know, time to blow the joint

[Hook: Stalley]
See I make my money with the dice, shake 'em up
Double up, triple up, twice, I made enough
Round here, that's what we call life, live it up
Drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block
So player, make a hater wanna jock
See rhyme saves, get the paper, you can shop
Bags, fill 'em up, credit card, bill it up

[Verse 3: Stalley]
I perfected the come up, hustle harder than most
Stack papers til it wrinkled and mold
They said you ain't getting it until them dollars don't fold
So I ain't ever relaxed, head crack after head crack
My approach is leave with it all
Go spend that and bend back and do it again
Such a rush when it's all or nothing, dice flicking in your hand
Everything is hittin', got you feeling you the man
Such an awesome zone to be in
I recline when the pressure's on the martyr, for starters, I took the first stone
My cost home had me nurturing my first poem
Then I decided throwing everything I worked for
Cause I was racing but it all felt dirt slow
Miles away from millionaires felt closer with each throw
If you're not willing to put it all in, then what you came fo'
Scared money donâ€™t make money
A broke mouth can't speak for me
Talk is cheap, I've been all in, let's get money
Talk is cheap, I've been all in, let's get money
A broke mouth can't speak for me

[Hook: Stalley]
See I make my money with the dice, shake 'em up
Double up, triple up, twice, I made enough
Round here, that's what we call life, live it up
Drink sip it up, get a cup, fill it up
Move my way down the block
So player, make a hater wanna jock
See rhyme saves, get the paper, you can shop
Bags, fill 'em up, credit card, bill it up

[Outro: Stalley & Rick Ross]
Fast talkin', pimp walkin' how we live it up
Shake it up, shake it up
Fast talkin', pimp walkin' how we live it up
Dice game, head crack a six, triple up
Live it up, live it up
Real niggas wanna shout, live it up
