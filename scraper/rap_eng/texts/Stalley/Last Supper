[Verse 1]
Correct
I do what I want, yeah I'm poppin'
They say that's how you live when you got is sold
They say you ain't really rich if your money fold
You gotta invest, you gotta be careful where the money go
Gotta dress to impress, that's for the honey's though
I'd rather dress in some sweats, Air 1's with the gummy sole
Little gold, blue stones for the crew reppin'
Hit the function, played the wall got my 2 steppin'
Then we left in them Chevys once them fools stepped in
Way too cool for the scuffle or the pulled weapon
Won't lose blessings over jealous niggas or schemin' boppers
Rather give praise to God over steamin' lobsters
Break bread with my real ones, that's what the game taught us
The family small but the crib enormous
They sucker free and remain flawless
This the circle of the ride or dies that stayed loyal

[Hook]
All my niggas at the table with me
The last supper
I'm surprised to see who made it with me
The last supper
If I die before I wake 'n bake
The last supper
I pray to Allah my soul to take
The last supper

[Verse 2]
I got a hustler's spirit, peep how I wear it
I put blood sweat and tears into every lyric
My heart be to God, my (?)
I try not to collide with evil spirits
Roll up and get high, my mind I clear it 'cause
The stress'll drive you over the cliff if you let it but um
I'm cool under pressure, that pressure nothing I stunt
The first in these retros, these Jordans ain't coming for months
My grooves the grooviest, yah I bang out the trunks
My crew full of bruisers don't try and play us for chumps
Your crew full of losers, y'all ain't won nothing in months
BCG the new movement, y'all don't want nothing with us
We came from pennies and crumbs, the ghettoist slums
So we don't settle for nothing
Put hard work in 'til the gold medals is won
Flaunt championship rings and the plaques is hung
And everything platinum
From the records to the visas, used to be reckless underachievers
These Seattle nights are sleepless overnight flights to Ibiza
Speeding Porsches down San Miguel I escaped the reaper for now
But if he returns I pray for one last supper before I'm out

[Hook]
All my niggas at the table with me
The last supper
I'm surprised to see who made it with me
The last supper
If I die before I wake 'n bake
The last supper
I pray to Allah my soul to take
The last supper
