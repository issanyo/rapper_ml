[Chorus]
They want me to change but some things just can't be rewritten
God of gods, light of light, they all true and living
Authentic like this book I hold in palm
With mercy, embrace all things, (through this) Holy Quran
Ho-Holy Quran
Holy Quran
Holy Quran
Ho-Holy Quran

[Verse 1]
They want me to change, want me deranged
Locked up in cage, head full of rage
It's insane, the percentage of my niggas that's gone
And all my niggas that's home, hold your head and stay strong
What's hatnin' in the White House got my black thoughts runnin'
Deeply rooted in this evil, I'm tryna crop out somethin'
And plant these good seeds of mine, hope they see the signs
While my people die on Vines, Twitter, Facebook live
Desensitized by murder, murder, bloody murder
Likes and retweets, no helping hands, just all observers
Hype converters, wave surfers, they don't serve no purpose
Government at the service, God save us, we out here livin' worthless

[Chorus]
They want me to change but some things just can't be rewritten
God of gods, light of light, they all true and living
Authentic like this book I hold in palm
With mercy, embrace all things, (through this) Holy Quran
Ho-Holy Quran
Holy Quran
Holy Quran
Ho-Holy Quran

[Verse 2]
They tryna crucify me for my originality
They say a man's worth depends on salary
But what's money with selfish ways and no one's proud of me?
The ugly truth got fat pockets and high calories
A gluttonous approach, with a selfish mentality
The wicked ways of sin, I be fightin' all these Jinns
Fake friends, backstabbers, they be knifin' at my skin
I rose from the ghetto without a thorn in my stem
I'm written and unbothered, completely who I'm 'posed to be
Comfortable in my own skin, even if no one notice me
But notably, I'm known as King, someone who control this dream
And broke free of every iron hand that had a hold on me

[Chorus]
They want me to change but some things just can't be rewritten
God of gods, light of light, they all true and living
Authentic like this book I hold in palm
With mercy, embrace all things, (through this) Holy Quran
Ho-Holy Quran
