[Verse 1]
Wood on my Cartiers
Wood grain when I stares
LeBron twelves on the wood
Watch the Cavaliers
They say, there's levels to this game
Well I'm at its highest tier
Eveything is rare
Down to the P's on my feet
Diamonds in my seats
Got diamonds on repeat
Got the baddest girl you've ever seen
Riding next to me
Dimes by the fleet
Thats the playa's way
Hate the word fleek
That ain't the playas lang
Never knock another man's hustle
I let them playas play
Live my life on the edge
(?) my life the safe way
Money in my pockets, on the floor
Never kept a safe
Love my '87 Carlo
You can have that Wraith
Real niggas got your back
These sucka niggas had your tape
We just trying to stack that pay
They say they seen me riding on chrome
That was yesterday
Today I'm cooling out on Vogues
Just like them playas play
My niggas getting it by the bulk
Whatchu weigh today?

[Hook]
Diamonds in my watch, diamonds in my chian
Diamonds in my rings, diamonds in my frames
That's just the playa way
The playa way
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Expecting macking
I'm maxing letting my mild burn
Was off balance, tilted axis
But we live and learn
I'm back straight and relaxed
Just like pimping's (?)
What have I lost?
Charge it to the game
Thats pimping terms
Don't want nothing I ain't worked for
Just what a playa earned
Naw I'm lying, I want it all plus the extras
From mansions to Rolexes
Supermodels on the texts
Strippers out in Texas on my facetime
.38 on my waistline, cause pigs love to hate crime
Playa haters out to take mine
I'm living for my niggas on that state line
The ones who kept me grinding
And told me never ever waste time
Your house they'll surround it you try and take me out mine
Thats loyalty outline
Some behind bars sacrificing their lifetime
So everybody else shine
Its foolish and selfless at the same time
But they wouldn't have it no other way
When living the playas way

[Hook]
