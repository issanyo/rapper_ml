[Intro]
Don't leave a motherfuckin' 'gain

[Verse 1]
Lord giveth, Lord taketh way
Well if he gave me this pain I pray he take it away
I pray he take it today
Cause it's been too long
I've been too strong
I've been holdin' on for too long to all of this wrong
I'm tryna better my life, I'm tryna weather the storm
I wanna dance in the rain, I wanna flap my arms
I wanna fly away from everyone who tries to bring harm
Rise your arms if you feel me
Sing along if you feel me
If you're in pain shout for the hillie
That means so loud you crack the ceiling
Don't be afraid to be yourself, no concealing
No hiding behind shine on them shine
Got with your life, don't let 'em go blind
Visine for the 3rd eye
Hearin' aids for the hearing impaired

[Hook]
To make sure you heard mine
Make sure you heard mine
To make sure you heard mine
Make sure you heard mine
My frequency high, frequency high
Frequency high, frequency high
My frequency high, frequency high
Frequency high, frequency high

[Verse 2]
Bless the mic with the prophet's speech of Yusuf
The prophecies of Martin Luther
Tryna shake these snakes out my head like Medusa
They after me
Stone cold savagery
Tryna capture me every time I try to escape
It's like the the devil's in the passenger's seat
In my ear tellin' me what I can't do and what I won't be
Drainin' my confidence, got me feelin' low
Talkin' at my soul but I'm a Conan
And I got my armor on
Stay around positive vibes
Cause I'm a hater for world traveler, yeah
I stay around the globe, spreadin' love like the Brooklyn rapper
Still protectin' flex, don't let the reaper snatch ya
I speak for blacker days cause those lives matter
We in the maze hustlin' backwards, twistin' backwards
Skippin' school, skippin' out on masters
We let the masters be our masters, follow in suit
And every sense of the world our brains captured

[Outro]
By my frequency high, my frequency high
My frequency high, my frequency high
My frequency high, frequency high
My frequency high, frequency high
My frequency high, frequency high
My frequency high, frequency high
