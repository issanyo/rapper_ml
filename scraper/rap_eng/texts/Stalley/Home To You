On this savage journey...

[Verse 1: Stalley]
I ain't seen my lady in days, I been out on these streets so long
Late night to the early morn, I been such a rolling stone
And I just wanna make it home (make it home)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
Blinded by all these street lights, up late, can't sleep nights
My stomach growling, I ain't eating right, my mind gone, I ain't thinking right
I ain't tryna just be getting by, don't want a slice, I want the pie
American dreaming, days of a heathen running up in your building at night
Masked up, this ain't trick or treat, one wrong move they finna squeeze
We ain't come for peace, you can bend your knees and pray all day
They waiting on me to give an a-okay, then the K gon' spray
But today's your day, I'mma let you live, I'mma let you pay
Back everything you ever said to me so start with the thing that you said to me
I was worthless, I'd never make it, go ahead! Spill that hatred
You are now face to face with a thorough pharaoh who be down on Death Row
You says to me but I'll let you, now let go
Chevy filled up on Petrol, times like this I just roll
Avenue that Avenue I'm doing more than just passing through
I'm after you bringing traffic through
Banging out niggas with attitude
Yeah my niggas stay with a little attitude
So like I said before don't act a fool

[Hook: Anthony Flammia & (Stalley)]
Yeah yeah yeah, uh
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn
(Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone)
I just wanna make it home to you, to you, to you, to you
I've been out on these streets so long, late night to the early morn

[Verse 2: Wale]
I'm a motherfuckin' roamer! Stoned up
Feeling like I'm in a coma, hold up
I got some money I should tend to, gotta get to it
I don't mean to Matthew Kemp you, but shit you
Ain't heard a nigga thorough, it ain't perfect, but I work
And that purple that I got got me on slur with all my words
Thats my word, thats my boy too, yall dont really know what Ive gone through
Now me, Stalley, and Meek wanna see Ross get the A-Rod loot
Big play, hot juice, Drama called and you're Carl Lewis
My opponents so obtuse, even if they alone they not top two
I'm in Ohio watching Kyrie and Samardo hoopin'
Work loud, chokin', all your reefer, it's soft spoken

[Hook: Anthony Flammia & (Stalley)]

(Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone, I've been such a rolling stone
Late night to the early morn, I've been such a rolling stone
Rolling stone, rolling stone, I've been such a rolling stone)

[Outro]
Well the whole idea of the American Dream is is there really something out there to be looking for? Is there a...you know, you know, as college students here, you know, that's the kinda thing, you know, we're all looking for it, you know, to find out, you know, that's why, why we're all here, right guys?
