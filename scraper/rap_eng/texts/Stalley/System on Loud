[Hook:]
Boom boom, bang bang, system on loud
Got that boom boom, bang bang, system on loud [x3]
Everyday the same thing
I just wanna live

[Verse 1:]
Riding 'round town with my windows tinted out
Boom boom, bang bang, system on loud
Everyday the same thing, drifting on clouds
Got that got that pack of blue dream, twisting up loud
Rolling up by the pound, burning by the mile
Windows cracked, smoke flowing out
Double cup, ack, sprite pouring out
I'm in my zone I'm in my zone (I'm in my zone)
Blunt after blunt tryna keep it gone
Don't want this feeling to escape me, I'm facing bluntscrazy
Seeing clearer than an HD
Colder than the AC, I'm speeding on about eighty
And my eighty-three Mercedes, three eighty SL
Fish-tailing down the eighty screaming F the world
With not a care to give
I don't wanna be judged, I just wanna live
This for the genius loners and all my stoner kids
Who wanna smoke and ride [?]

[Hook 2x + repeated lines till end of song]
Everyday the same thing
Rolling up by the pound, rolling up by the mile
Windows cracked, smoke flowing out (Everyday the same thing)
I don't wanna be judge
You want more?
