[Intro]
Yeah
Let's keep it going
This one right here
The Autobiography
Shout out to Ohio
Let's go
Keep it moving

[Verse]
I am the first musical note
The first beat of a drum
The African son
I am a ton
Heavy on the mic
A reflection of the ghetto
I am mellow, I am hard as metal
I am a rebel
Without a cause
Not a worker I am certainly a boss
Jack Frost, Flacko Stalley (?) I am raw
Talent like LeBron with a bomb
He shoots, he scores then he carries them off
Shoulders I dust 'em off
If I ever stumble through the frontal
Barry Sanders when manuevering
I never fumble
My past is what I come to
My futures what they run to
So ahead of my time
No need for a microphone check 1,2
Cause I'm already on
Already born to master the ceremony
So what I give to you is happiness
Struggle of love
And the reintroduction of
(?)
I am a bar of hope
I am faith in your face
To help grow on
And know I'm taking music to a better place
