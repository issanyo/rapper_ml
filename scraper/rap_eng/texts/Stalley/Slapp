[Hook: Rashad]
I'm in ya lane with my Lac
Woofers banging in the back
Turn it up make it slapp
Turn it up make it slapp
Turn it up make it slapp
I'm in ya lane with my Chevy
Bass banging so heavy
Hope the whole world hear me
Make it slapp yeah
Turn turn it up yeah
Make it slap yeah
Make it slapp
Make it slapp

[Verse 1: Stalley]
SS digital dash, bucket seats
Pipes hanging off the ass, trunk going gorilla
The whole box frame rattling glass 5 M-P-H down the ave
Doors swinging eyes hanging off the paint job
Sunlight flicker
Stars give the same mirage bending corners hard, showing off
Foot hanging through the door
500 horses stomping
Got the whole hood banging, bet they hear me out in Compton
Right here from Harsh Ave
Where it all started at
Monster truck extended cab
73 Caprice chopping
Niggas lose they mind when they see the slab
Boppers love to hear it slapp
TV's in the front and back
Pulling off 10 deep
That's how we be rolling out showing out 15's 18's we be blowing out
Volume to the max
Never ever holding back
Weak niggas think they doing something until I pull up and drown em out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Still unruly when we come through your residential
Alpines beatin 18's cracking pencils
Shatter muscle car dreams
When the Chevy Impala leans
From the flick of the switch
Make it start dancing down the streets
Like in New Orleans sounds like a second line is in the backseat
Brass trumpet tooting
Noise polluting
Dayton spokes cruising
Flip flop shine
Got the block feuding on what color I'm riding
Sunk so low it looks like I'm hiding
Queen passenger seat riding
Car reflects everything that I am
Classic and old school mixed with new school
Fully dressed new shoes cleaner than a whistle be
Every time I pull up, stares, like they was missing me
Sitting so high you need stairs when you enter the V
Looking down at my competition
Remember when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now I got windows to throw it out of
And 12 door speakers to blare it out of

[Hook x2]
