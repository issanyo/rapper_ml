[Intro]
I got 8 chains on, 6 rings on, feel like Jordan

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
I done fucked up a sack, had to make it back
Had to hit a juug, hit licks in all black
The struggle, the struggle, the struggle
I got to go get it in bundles
Ain’t nobody give me shit, bitch I had to juug
I done ran up a sack, now my family good
The haters see me on top, I’m grinding, they wish I would stop
I’m tipping the strippers, the hundred, the fifty, the twenties
I get to the money
The kitchen, I’m cooking and whipping and flipping
The bricks I serve in a dummy
Our money Gianni Versace, the Gucci, the Louis, the Fendi
I’m trapping and eating at Bennys
You broke, you eating at Wendys
I done fucked my [?] up like 1000 times
If it ain’t guala than please don’t waste my time
Trapping, it turned into rapping
I don’t even know how it happened
Vacations across the world
I’m cooling, I’m chilling, relaxing

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
I perfected my hustle, all you rappers in trouble
My first bed was a single, the money under it double
Yeah I came from the rubble, now I’m a diamond the rock
And your bitch want a shot, we know her nigga gon block
Just to get to where I’m getting, nigga take a second
Cold shit dropping and they say I got the lake effect
Hot boy, but every time I hit em I can make em wet
They say he getting money, well little homie place a bet
See I done fucked it up and made it back 100 times
A new watch, a new whip, homie you can see the signs
And if you can’t see that, then you’re probably blind
Nigga say he get it like me, then he probably lying

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

[Verse 3: Stalley]
I ain’t never been worried bout no dollar, nigga
Cause getting what I want ain’t never been no problem, nigga
I got watches, I got chains, I got coupes and trucks
Revolvers, automatics, when we shoot em, duck
I’m from the ghetto where they smoke, snort, and shooting up
And for them robbings choosing [?] niggas boosting stuff
If it’s a [?] my BGs booting up, rolling up
Heavy skunk, cop a brick, shave it down till the corner cut
Make 40, then burn it up
Off of that one night of turning up
I done made it back a million times, a million times
Off a million grinds
Now my Cuban bracelet got a million diamonds
And a hater blocking, tryna stop this shining gon get this iron

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
