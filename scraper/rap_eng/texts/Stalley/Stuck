[Intro]
Come speak for 'em (Mario!)
Try to reach out to 'em
They can only respect it, you know?

[Chorus]
Aqua Ace, Bathing Ape, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
Gorilla glue to the face
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
I'm stuck

[Verse 1]
I stopped wearing all my chains, put diamonds on my main
Forgot my new thing, she do the Vera Wang
She mix it with Balmain and I'm mixing up my drink
[?] stains, get higher than airplane
Keep money like a bank, all my t-shirts plain
With a little polo, mane, in all white like a saint
Kicking all this game, I be flexing on these lames
Vet through the lane, I go hard in the paint
Pablo when I paint, take no problems from these dames
Sweater, Christopher Cane, Raf Simons on the face
Fresh as [?], do shrooms at the rave
Like school first day, had my outfit laid

[Chorus]
Aqua feets, Bathing Ape, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
Gorilla glue to the face
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
I'm stuck

[Verse 2]
(Seal poppin') seal poppin'
(We still poppin') we still poppin'
(She hit the cup) she hit the cup
(She feel nauseous) she feel nauseous
I'm in Tim Coppens (Tim Coppens)
The coupe topless (the coupe topless)
[?] moccasins ([?] moccasins)
Flyest in seven continents (seven continents)
Gold lay on my teeth (lay on my teeth)
Like I lay on the beat (lay on the beat)
Enlighten the world (enlighten the world)
Every time that I speak (every time that I speak)
Money and weed (money and weed)
That's all that I need (all that I need)
Comme des Garçons (Comme des Garçons)
Got hearts all on me (hearts all on me)
Double G with them boss tigers, stay smoking like forest fire
Flat bitch, she like Knight Rider, po' a fo', make the Sprite darker
Scale the streets like Nightcrawler, these crowds got me feeling superhuman
(Smoking back to back, that's super fumin') double cup and I'm sipping Houston

[Chorus]
Aqua Ace, Bathing Ape, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
I get fresh everyday
Aqua Ace, Bathing Apes, I get fresh everyday
Gorilla glue to the face
I'm stuck, I'm stuck
I'm stuck
