[Stalley]
American made, I'm on a savage journey
While I'm earning, my stars and stripes
Won't let these niggas burn me
See, it take time for niggas to learn me
I've been through so much ish, and I ain't close to thirty
Still young in all my glory
Wait, let me tell this story
Hey, been through hell and back
Funny how I'm still intact
Move with the steel in fact, I ain't never peeled a cap
Not saying that won't, but that pressure got me ready to squeeze, and when I do no turning back
A renegade in combat, red wings and a ball cap
Nigga I am all that, anxiety and fear you call that
America's nightmare in all black, ghost in the flesh, I'm ALL THAT (I'M ALL THAT)
I'm mobbing, what you call that?
In the front line where they fall back
Chest out, head high
You can say I'm bout that life, never had to think it twice
Never had to think at life, this is just those basic instincts
Eyes never blinking twice, focused and fixated
They never thought I'd make it
Not out of Stark County, where there's nothing but sharks and bounties, goons and crackhead around me
You would've thought that ish would drown me
Or you would've found me, getting down at county
Martez always said I was an average, but she did say I was a savage kid
And this journey was prevalent
Before I'm hell bent on success, I smell it
Right under the nose, and rightfully I chose to go where no one before me would ever go
