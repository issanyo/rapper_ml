[Verse 1: Stalley]
Get your ass on the dance floor
And cut a rug, boxcutter cut a thug
And swing side to side, cuddle love
Ain’t that what we came for?
Ain’t that why we change clothes?
Different club, same hoes
They just want to stand close
I’m like where your man go?
She like where your girl at?
I say I ain’t got one
She scream “yeah I heard that”
Well I know you heard that
I be flying first class, and I can make your purse fat
What is that? Louis V?
Maybe I can Birkin that
Ever seen the Louvre at night?
Ever seen the Eiffel lights?
Paris, sippin’ purple Sprite
I can make you love this life
Out of all the guys in the club
Baby girl you picked the right one to come and stand by
So if you want to fly tonight I’ll take you off standby
I’ll take you off standby
If you want to fly tonight I’ll take you off standby

[Hook: STS]
It all started with a “Hi, how you doing?” and a hug
What’s your name? Where you from? How’d you end up in this club?
What you drankin’? What you drankin’?

[Verse 2: Stalley]
By the way love, I never got your name
She told me it was Lois but her friends call her Lane
Well I can be your Superman but never be a lame
Not a Clark or a [?], don’t think Mr. Save a Ho came
To the rescue, I’m just addressing you like a gentleman
Tryna caress your gentle frame
I know you in your right mind, I just want the best brain
Sike, I’m just testing your sense of humor
Your personality fills the room up
And I got a sharp tongue, so it’s only right I’m cutting you up
Champagne [?] for you
I’ll just do these double cups
The night’s over, my white Rover
Sittin’ like the Ku Klux on black dubs
Soft kisses and back rubs, or whips and chains with black gloves
As long as this is black love
Face down, put your back up
Type of nightcap I’m wishing for
Compliments what you fishing for
I’ve been givin’ ‘em to you all night
Now it’s time to hit the road
So I’ma pay this tab, while you go get your coat

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Love to get another one of those, and maybe we can coast and chill
Talk about what’s truly real to the heart and soul
Evolution of life, the highs and lows
Then we can drop our cool
And talk like we went to the same high school
It’s been so long
Since we seen each other
Sad that we had to move to pursue our dreams
And I really didn’t expect to see you out here on the scene
But perhaps we can catch up like a relay runner on the Olympic team
We fell out of touch, and I apologize if it seems we talk too much
But the time we spent rapping on about hows and whens just ain’t enough
So can I proceed? To pick your mind a bit
I got an old school whip you can climb up in
The night time blow like the skyline
Baby girl you never want to ride with the top again
Slow it down, slow it down for you
Got a red carpet I could roll out for you
With a strong arm I could hold out for you
You such a queen I bring the gold out for you
And a whole lot of lovin’
A whole lot of drinkin’ means a whole lot of buzzin’
And I know I kept it clean all this time
But that’s a whole lot of
I’m just saying, baby girl I’m just playing
We can cut a rug or two
Perhaps you can fall in love with me
And I with you
