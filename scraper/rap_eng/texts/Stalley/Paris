[Hook: Omarion]
She be all on my mind and she gone wit it
Yeah, make a nigga wanna fall in it
In the winter time she be cold wit it
Warm up baby I be all in it
I be all in it
You be calling it
And I be on way no stalling it
Yeah make a nigga wanna fall in it
Yeah,Your body keep calling

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Speeding in my fast car
Reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw
Wax on, wax off, man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted
But I give that kitten hats off
I was jimmy strapped when I fell up in that cat paws
All over my body
Me I don't ?
Had to head downtown
?
?
Stretch it like pilate
1-10 Maseratti
Burning down the highway
Burning on some molly
Could this be love or infatuation of the body
The fact is that I’m sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at 6 in the morning
Horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely
It’s just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts
Could it be me and the goddess?
Well if I play my cards right
Taron cards on the dashboard
If they read write and leave me right
Back To my queen tonight aight

[Verse 2: Stalley]
20 minutes from home, she’s still on my mind
As the sun rise ahead, I hit 95
Eyes heavy from the mari-juan as
I stare upon the sunset trying to make it home
Heart racing trying to make it calm
Love drum beating on my insides
Writing his own song
Fighting the urge to bust a U turn
If I ain’t fighting for her than what’s the use, huh?
I usually leave after I smash em
No feelings attached guess that's the past huh?
Looking at the exes as i past them
I'm so lost but know where I’m going
Confused at my motives
Lonely or in love
Optimistic or I'm hopeless
Romantic I'm frantic I wrote this
I'm usually heartless it's haunting
Her presence is my focus
I’m presently out of focus
Speeding in my fast car
Reminiscing on the girl that I last saw

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
To immature niggas who just don’t know what they doing
They’d be having bitches but be in the club choosing
They think everything’s a game and find everything amusing
You young I think you should lower your expectations
Get high with a nigga and exercise some patience
I could work you out, do it in the ways you ain’t expect it
And everytime you throw it back you know I'm down to catch it
You love the way a nigga spend money like it’s nothing
You Gimme good top when I don't feel like fucking
And sometime you’ll be tripping and you push a nigga button
But i can't do them discussions you know a nigga hustling
Told you that you’re beautiful and now that got you blushing
Gushing we can sip slow why we rushing?
Ciroc got ? spill ? on my leather
And every time you call me then I'm coming there whenever fuck wit me
