[Hook: Crystal Torress]
Yeah we crawled to the top in a savage world
[crown your world?] crown your head, thats mine to take
So don't get too comfortable
It's a long way down

[Verse 1]
A rebel with a cause here to take it all
See that crown that your're wearing time to take it off
Bear claws and a mighty grip
We bear arms, caught that ish, never bite a lip
This is true warrior music we exhort your list
Black listed from these black fisted rap lists
Even though we strugglin black kids
The fact is we just hustle till this dirt lift and we [squirtin automatics?]
A savage, raised in the jungle
Amongst heathens and demons in this jungle
We do anything just to leave up out this jungle
No trees just concrete it's hard to breathe up in this jungle
But we rumble in this jungle
6 degrees up in this jungle
No separation so it's hard to leave up out this jungle
And they wonder why we turn bad when they come past this jungle
Cause we done seen and had enough bad while living through this struggle

[Hook]
Yeah we crawled to the top in a savage world
[crown your world?] crown your head, thats mine to take
So don't get too comfortable
See you standing on the top of the world now
Nothings promised every man can be replaced
So don't get to comfortable
Its a long way down

[Verse 2]
Black mask black gloves a hood terrorist
Intelligent psychopaths the worlds scared of us
The skin of a million slaves ain't no tearing us
Show up at your masters door ain't no fear in us
We buried love, sent slugs with this rebel message
We been in the trap too long we just want our leverage
Gave [it/our?] time, sent through hell now we want our heavens
Kings in Alexander McQueens and some Jordan Sevens
BCG rebellion scaredy cats tuck your tales in
For we marching until [this hell ends/it's hell in?]
Until salvation, or they take my hands and jam the nails in
Cruicified by lucifer
On the stick of being poor
Guess we got the short end
No choice of doing right, the bad we was forced in
Poor souls with poor pockets searching for a fortune
Crawling out this whole we was tossed in
Coming for that crown that you flossin

[Hook]
Yeah we crawled to the top in a savage world
[crown your world?] crown your head, thats mine to take
So don't get too comfortable
See you standing on the top of the world now
Nothings promised every man can be replaced
So don't get to comfortable
Its a long way down
