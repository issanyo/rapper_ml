[Intro: Stalley]
Fuck a nigga hatin'
This money I be chasin'
Fuck a nigga hatin'

[Hook: Stalley]
Fuck a nigga hatin'
This money I be chasin' (Chasin')
9-11 racin' (race)
I came from the basement (I came from it)
Not a pot to piss in (not one)
Now its V-12 engines (Vroom)
Speedin' out the trenches (yey)
I'm squattin' on you hoes (Squattin')

[Verse 1: Stalley]
(?)
Take a nigga soul
Got snakes on my clothes
Diamond boogers in my gold
Hermes when I blow my nose
Designer from head to toe
Fashion killa wish a Gunter
Four G savings like a nunchuk
Cuban shining like the sun's up
Bank on my like Sun Trust
Never spend it on a ho
Ain't no ho that son trust
Maybach like a small bus
Got enough room to throw a party in it
Ride by catch a body in it
Treat that '62 like a '64

[Pre-Hook: Stalley]
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'

[Hook: Stalley]
Fuck a nigga hatin'

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Fish scale we play with that
Fuck 12 in my Raiders hat
On the southeast where my raiders at
B & E taking all your stacks
My .357 I call it cap
Jet black its pro-black
Triangle where the nose at
Squeeze once they all collapse
I smoke, relax get my chill on
Gotta smoke 12 before I feel stoned
Copied so much that I feel cloned
Streets ain't safe but its still home
Off the porch with the .45
I'm the MJ of gats
Trill niggas don't fade away
Ride the 'rari like Chevrolet

[Pre-Hook: Stalley]
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'
Keep it jumpin'
