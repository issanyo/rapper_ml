I can't hold my tongue
These kids are my grandchildren
And you're raising them wrong
They're terrible boys
Shut up Chip or I'll go ape shit on your ass
(?) says to kick you in the back of the head
Yeah, yeah
Turn up the heat
Go on and get some boys
C'mon
I'm ten years old but I'll beat your ass
Chip I'm gon' come at you like a spider monkey
Like a spider monkey
Go on
Chip you brought this on man
Greatest generation my ass
Tom Brokaw is a punk
What is wrong with you
Chip I'm all jacked up on Mountain Dew
Oooh ooh I love that
You gonna let you sons talk to their grandfather like that
I'm their elder
I sure as hell am Chip
I love the way they're talking to you
Cause they're winners
Winners get to do what they wnat
Hell you're just a bag of bones
Only thing you ever done with your life was make a hot daughter
That's it
That's it
That is it
