[Intro: Stalley]
Humble this, humble that
Underrated this, underrated that
This year I'm pulling up on niggas boy
Correct

[Hook: Stalley]
I just hopped out in a fisker
Money on my mind, I ain't for the bullshit
(?) fell off, well I'm just getting rich, wrist glow
These stones cost the salary of a pitcher, major

[Verse: Stalley]
Since Skypager I been getting paper, single
Ronald my feet in all flavors, I'm labelled
With a bad chick from Barbados
She thick like she putting sugar in the mashed potatoes
Rolling cookies from the coast getting elevated
Putting haters in hell, oh well they just mad I made it
Let it burn
I'm at the top, wait your turn
I be smoking so much all these ashes fill their urn
Talking what I earn
I'm still spinning from '09 this rapping a goldmine
I'm running through the goal line
My day ones protect me like the Denver Broncos O-line
I'm Payton in his prime, quarterback and calling shots
How he black and call the cops
I used to be a hard top fanatic until I copped a drop
Threw Ds on that boy and got rid of all the stocks
All these Air Ones in my closet you'd think I had Nike stocks
BCG Stan socks, vintage Daytona watch
The Paul Newman, car boomin' like a stick of dynamite
Setting shit off these other bitches ain't rhyming right
(Bitches ain't rhyming right)
(I'm setting shit off, these other bitches ain't rhyming right)

[Hook: Stalley]
I just hopped out in a fisker
Money on my mind, I ain't for the bullshit
(?) fell off, well I'm just getting rich, wrist glow
These stones cost the salary of a pitcher, major
I just hopped out in a fisker
Money on my mind, I ain't for the bullshit
(?) fell off, well I'm just getting rich, wrist glow
These stones cost the salary of a pitcher, major

Correct

[Outro: Stalley]
Humble this, humble that
Underrated this, underrated that
This year I'm pulling up on niggas boy
Correct
