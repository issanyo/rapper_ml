[Intro]
Y'all niggas hurry up. Go in there, buck them niggas and get the fuck out. Don't be playin, ya hear what I'm sayin? Kill them niggas and get the fuck back so we can stay ballin', I'mma be chillin right here

[Hook]
Champagne pourin', big joint rollin'
Bombay sippin', bad bitch gettin'

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Just got the whip detailed
800 horses in the car, V-12
My girl doing her nails, don't let the polish spill
As I bend the corners, tilting down the hill cup on chill
Triple stacked up, racked up with a deal
Do what I want, man, bump how they feel
About it I'm about it nigga that's just how it is
Fast cars, gold chains that's just how I live
You don't like it, do something
Scrap and shoot somethin'
Niggas all bark, no bite, ain't gon' do nothing
Weak lames hate see a young king stunting
In my King James 100 miles and runnin'
All my niggas gettin' papers ain't nobody here for nothin'
And they all killing for me so don't let 'em get the dumpin'
For my homies dead and gone, go and spill something
Livin' for my niggas in the feds doing real numbers
Heavy rotations on the blunts ain't tryna feel nothing, zoned out
Glass house comes with the push buttons, overdrive
I'm Superfly, Ron O'Neal suit and tie
Hustler to the max, if you want it done right homie come to the wax

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Ey, homie, you need some help? (*Gunshots*) Punk ass niggas, come on niggas

[Verse 2]
A-Wax in the two seater
Bad diva pourin' a pint in a two liter
Blue flannel tan khaki's tucking two heaters
45 Desert Eagles fitted by Leaders
Blue sneakers stay fleet when I'm out
Gold in my mouth talk diamonds like a jeweler
Rings on my fingers call me Slick Rick the Ruler
Whoever don't like me middle finger to ya
Booyah, booyah I send shots straight through ya
Talents rip you apart niggas can't kill ya
Don't compare my talent to y'all, y'all niggas straight losers
I'm a bully, I'm a Boozer, couch standin' Tom Cruiser
My champagne cooler, plain Jane Muller
Blueberry Swisher sweets Mary Jane blower
Leave with any girl that I choose like I know her
Passionate 'bout my game, like Joakim Noah
I'm a bull

[Hook]
