A lot of tap dancing going on, industry buffoons
They told me not to bring out the skeletons in these rooms
But these children are doomed with these fake ass rappers lying about what they do
And these record execs overlook the rhyme, to put you in chains and give you a little shine, lock up your mind
Slave master mentality, on every nigga that's signed, so I decline with a freedom mind
Whipping' my balls at your racist comments
Right fist up all honest and I'mma do it like I promised with my soul polished not a flaw scratch on me
Liberated so I pass money
And all that monkey ish keep from round me
This is war, y'all looking like Robert Downey embarrassing a culture and I'm feeling like a revolutionary poster hanging over Capital Hill with two pistols in a holster
Power

One stone after another until I bring down the devils house
Screaming outside the prison house until I free every rebel out
This the voice that won't settle down, never forget about [?]and every black leader that ever follow what they believe in
And in my dreams I be seeing their visions so clear so when my lyrics hit the air
I just hope the world hears how these fake niggas get scared to speak up
I'm pulling all mask off unveiling under the surface and those with voices are worthless
Rapping about clown ish and I'mma be the one to lift the ground up so you really see what's going on around us
There's no leaders in the game, just a bunch of monkey's tryna hang in packs and do the same thing
But your followers lost in clouds of smoke, and you wonder why the white folks call us joke and never take us serious

You know, and I just wanted to give people that
I wanted people to know that I'm like a everyday dude just like you are, you know
And I've went through the ups and downs same as you
Like, um you know my friend he always picks at me and he calls me like the Bruce Springsteen of Hip-Hop
You know what I'm saying cos he say I write for the blue collar workers and like, you know like the everyday working class man
But that's what it is, that's where I come from
You know what I mean
I come from a blue collar city
Everyday working class people working steeling factories and steel mills and the railroads and you know so, that's life for me
