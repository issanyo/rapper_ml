Mario!

[Chorus]
L-Life’s great (life’s great)
Thank God I made it through to see another day (another day)
And I ain’t got to trap
I found another way (another way)
I’m picking through this eighth
I’m tryna levitate (I levitate)
Now all these heavy problems become featherweight (they featherweight)
These shoulders made for burdens
We will never cave (we never cave)
Racing to the top
I bet I never break (I’ll never break)
Middle finger to the sky
That’s how we celebrate (we celebrate)
That’s how we celebrate (celebrate)

[Verse 1]
New chapter (new chapter)
Had to rewrite my story
I can’t move backwards (can’t move backwards)
Mistakes bound to happen
Gotta move faster (gotta move fast)
Gotta keep pace in this long race
Don’t let dudes pass ya (can’t let dudes pass ya)
Parted ways with that label
I don’t do masters (I don’t do masters)
I feel free now (I’m free now)
Took my shot, it bounced back then I rebound (had to rebound)
Had to adjust, clear my Cardi’s I can see now (I can see)
I admit I took some punches
I was beat down (I was beat down)
Couldn’t lay down, dust it off, put my feet down (put my feet down)
Got emotion put myself first had to make me proud (make me proud)
Put some distance between these niggas tryna break me down (break me down)
No more silence, no more hiding, you gonna hear me loud

[Chorus]
L-Life’s great (life’s great)
Thank God I made it through to see another day (another day)
And I ain’t got to trap
I found another way (another way)
I’m picking through this eighth
I’m tryna levitate (I levitate)
Now all these heavy problems become featherweight (they featherweight)
These shoulders made for burdens
We will never cave (we never cave)
Racing to the top
I bet I never break (I’ll never break)
Middle finger to the sky
That’s how we celebrate (we celebrate)
That’s how we celebrate (celebrate)

[Verse 2]
Out here chasing my payday (payday)
Gotta fam to feed like day day (got a family to feed)
Streets calling out mayday
They need to save you what they say
And that’s me (that’s me)
Who woulda thought a prophet would’ve come from the southeast (the city)
Overcame the struggle and made it out of these streets (these streets)
Still hustling though (hustling though)
Like Terrence Howard (Terre nce Howard)
I hustle the flow (I hustle the flow)
Inspired to build my empire
Put logos on clothes (logos on clothes)
They tried to box me in but I broke all the codes (broke all the codes)
I came from greatness ain’t no patience till I sit with the GOATs (I sit with the GOATs)
Everyday’s a celebration
I should live on a float (I’ll live on a float)
Championship after championship
I’m wearing the gold (I’m wearing the gold)
After all of life’s defeats this winning never gets old (it never gets old)

[Chorus]
L-Life’s great (life’s great)
Thank God I made it through to see another day (another day)
And I ain’t got to trap
I found another way (another way)
I’m picking through this eighth
I’m tryna levitate (I levitate)
Now all these heavy problems become featherweight (they featherweight)
These shoulders made for burdens
We will never cave (we never cave)
Racing to the top
I bet I never break (I’ll never break)
Middle finger to the sky
That’s how we celebrate (we celebrate)
That’s how we celebrate (celebrate)
