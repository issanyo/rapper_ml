Cold-blooded killer put a bullet in his head

[Verse 1: Stalley]
My soul provider, my right hand, my go to
If I lost my left my right arm would hold you
When no one's left you're always the one I turn to
In all my wrongs you're always the one I learn through
We built bridges and yes of course I burned a few
But you kept it 8 more than 92
That's why I hate not being around you
My precious jewel, my good luck, my better half
You make everything better, you make for better laughs
In this crazy fast world you make the memories last
Cause times slower with you girl
When times get rough you always know what to do girl
For that you always say finish dark and cruel world
If anyone violate you know what I do girl
Murder in the first, I'll be the first for you girl
Hand me the Koran I'll spill the truth for you girl

[Hook: Goldie]
I'll be your shooter
Point him out and I swear I'll kill him dead
Yeah
I'll be your shooter
Cold-blooded killer put a bullet in his head
Yeah
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter

[Verse 2: Stalley]
A true treasure the average woman don't measure up
A natural beauty no Revlon or cover-up
My hip-hop queen hit Rev Run to marry us
I'm your real life king, no tales of fairy dust
You're umbrella when black clouds start to hover
But I still shower you with the love of
My whole heart, you gave me a new start
Like car jumpers or when defibrillators hit the heart
We been bumping, we got something special
If anyone come between it go on get the special
The point 38 in the front
Don't wanna be a killer I just know what I want
I don't wanna be a player and that's word to Big Pun
I'm a one-woman man all that pimping ish done
A red (?) jersey and my brand Jordan 1's
Just want a big crib with some daughters and some sons
So I can chill out and not have to use this gun

[Hook: Goldie]
I'll be your shooter
Point him out and I swear I'll kill him dead
Yeah
I'll be your shooter
Cold-blooded killer put a bullet in his head
Yeah
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter
I'll be your shooter

I'll be you shooter
