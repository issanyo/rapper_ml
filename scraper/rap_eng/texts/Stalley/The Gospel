[Verse 1: Stalley]
They say speak to m, let the words seep through them
Give them them native tungs, that jungle beat music
That he's so black, might get shot down in the street music
Afro with pumps in the trunk type music
That sound that make you jump off your ass and get to it
Inspirtered by great writers, all I see is ghosts
Why sometimes, you here inteligents mixed with bosts
No hoacks, real one since the beginning
No need to even mention, why bother
With the real talk, I speak it how they feel
? New Yourk, food for thought
I'm givin what they want

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Knolage born, give them wisdom and understanding
Few blue collard ?
Hands to the 9 to 5 workers
Hands on my rolex, 9 to 5, saying time to put this work in
Take the genius kids out the corner cirket
To bring power and piece to this rap circus
Dream mertchant changed lives with these verses
As a man, I speak each line perfect
Came from behind a black curtan, the chearch wershiped
