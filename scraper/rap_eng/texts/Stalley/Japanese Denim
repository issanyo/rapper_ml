[Hook: Stalley]
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Twisting up platinum cookies, weed on the scale
My shooter ride shotgun with a shotgun full of shells
If a nigga act up I got enough to get his bail
In the Lambo all black, I'm the black Christian Bale
Supreme camo sweats when I'm sliding through the field
Money hunter on the paper route trying to stack mills
Couple Ms ain't enough man I'm trying to stack for real
Put my family on the hill, Calabasas next to Seal
Chevy or the Rolls, just depending how I feel
I don't play with it, I slay shit, yah I'm out to kill
Ski mask with the grill looking like Young Buck
Deep dishes on the wheels swinging like nunchuks

[Hook: Stalley]
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Niggas hate to see you dream, they make it so clear
So I make that light beam on their little nightmare
They say the top is so far, tell 'em I'm sitting right there
Cause I make it look easy, believe me, I am quite rare
Chevys squatting on tens like Dennis Rodman
Twelve pistons my engine steady mobbing
Presidential my wrist with heavy diamonds
I put my life in this music with heavy climax
Put the world on alert with heavy sirens
I put the world on a shirt, don't even try it
They say negative fame'll kill a tryant
I paint pictures and frame my life inside it
Mine is Salvadore Dali with a full beard
Dressed in Armani watching time melt with a black stare
With my mind on my money, that vision be so clear
I'm focused that focus ain't going nowhere

[Hook: Stalley]
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs
Get money, bump everything else
Stay hustling, Goyard on the belt
Seven ringing, got money on my cell
Japanese denim, low top YSLs
