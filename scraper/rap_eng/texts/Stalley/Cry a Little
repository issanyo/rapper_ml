[Hook]
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away

[Verse 1]
God please take this pain away
I hope my father in a better place
I hope he and my brother up there playing spades
Talking 'bout how they're proud of me
Jackpot no lottery
Look what you made, no pottery
You motored up a true king
Bottled up this pain, gave me mood swings

[Bridge]
Your little baby boy got some new wings
That's why I never mind to tie my shoe strings
Just to keep from crying blow this blue dream
They say I'm my father's son, got his routine

[Hook]
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away

[Verse 2]
Three kids they all look like me (they so beautiful)
That means they look like you (look like you)
All tempermental (all tempermental)
Yeah they got that too
I see though every time they smile they lift me up
Every time I'm down, I hate when I'm not around
Don't wanna let 'em down like you did yours
Wanna be a father, best friend, a mentor
Wanna be a guider, provider, an anchor
Hold 'em down, I hold 'em back, what I aim for
Not wait til I'm dead to be their angel
This is love, don't mistake it as being hateful

[Hook]
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away
Cry a little laugh more
If you got a problem ask God
He can help you take the pain away
All those problems fade away
