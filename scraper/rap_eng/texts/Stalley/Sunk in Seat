[Intro]
Today I think I'ma
Pull out the '88 Caprice
I got some good weed
Pull up on the hoes
Hahaha
Correct

[Verse 1]
I'm on the skinniest tires
I usually do the Jordan's, today the Penny's is flyer
A plant, loud pack from my Cali supplier
Put pressure on the game took it down to the wire
They say pressure burst pipes, I hope it put out this fire
I got another joint to smoke, somebody give me a lighter
Trying to be higher than a jet fighter
Daredevil skydiver
Rare devil side rider
Paid in full like Mekhi Pfifer
Peace to all my lifers
From four dicks to Rikers
Black lives matter, everybody living righteous
Middle finger to the system, fuck if you don't like us
And fuck Donald Trump and everybody that's behind him

[Hook]
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Flow strolling, holding on to my beliefs
Crumbling herb, breaking down every leaf
Blowing clouds out the window, sunken seats
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Blowing clouds out the window, sunk in seats
Blowing smoke in my Caprice

[Verse 2]
If you grew up on me then you grew up a G
Instead of having shit on lock I'd rather give them the key
I'm major, I ain't no skater but my chain is a rink
Most these niggas haters so I don't care what they think
Fascinated by my presence so they stare with no blink
To keep from going crazy I use this beat as my shrink
Million worth of wisdom I had to lock it in Brinks
Couldn't give it to 'em raw I had to drop 'em in links
Small dosage of dopeness
Back to back roasting
Hot boxing the Caprice
Flicking out the roaches
I shine for the hopeless
Grind slow motion
Only to motivate you to keep it going and stay focused

[Hook]
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Flow strolling, holding on to my beliefs
Crumbling herb, breaking down every leaf
Blowing clouds out the window, sunken seats
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Smoking dope in my Caprice
Blowing clouds out the window, sunk in seats
Blowing smoke in my Caprice

[Outro]
My escape
My getaway
That's how I ride
