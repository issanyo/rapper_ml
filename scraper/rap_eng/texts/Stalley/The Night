[Verse 1: Stalley]
My older homies told me hustling’s a part of making it
And no one’s handing over anything you gotta take it
Not simple rules when you’re trying to flex skills and align yourself with bills and keep a ho to faithful it
‘cus most niggas making it took they soul away from it and did some god forsaken ish
That’s when the day fell and the night came, the angels grew horns and we was running through the streets like some Vikings
But loose wings trying to hold on to the sky but we was falling from the stars trying to stay alive
I know it seems funny what we’re reaching for and I was racing trying to put both feet through the door
The allure of success and more had me reeled in tunnel vision wish you felt how I felt then
Coat of dark like the sun was missing night vision through these dark corners fully prepared
I’ll be here till the light is on us

[Hook: Rashad]
No time for dreaming
I can’t close my eyes
Body’s sleeping
The night is on my mind
Watch me go
The sun is still shining
Everybody’s sleeping
The night is on my mind

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Wide and up start thinking ‘bout this cusp I’m on
It’s either be great or be forgotten that alone
Got me missing I was asleep writing poems
‘cus I ain’t never woke up to them silver spoons
Just a room full of mirrors to pick apart my flaws
Trying to see my life a bit clearer to reach my cause
I say are we here for the cause or because and Robert Greene says the Power of the 48 Laws
So I’m trying to figure out where I stand still decision has to be a quick move and it’s landfill
‘cus any minute I can blow that’s something that I can feel
No more dreams now, this is all real
Woke up ain’t been to sleep in two years
Rap’s like a game of musical chairs
You snooze and you lose and I can’t
Bring back time I’m comfortable in the day
But the night is always on my mind

[Hook: Rashad]
No time for dreaming
I can’t close my eyes
Body’s sleeping
The night is on my mind
Watch me go
The sun is still shining
Everybody’s sleeping
The night is on my mind
