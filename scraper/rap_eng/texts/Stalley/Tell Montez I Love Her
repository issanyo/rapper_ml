Verse 1

My momma called tell me they done turned the gas off
And I just spent 500 in the shopping mall
So I can look good for ya’ll
Guess I gotta take this mask off
Cause everything ain't picture perfect
She 60 now, and she still workin
These tears jerkin and its painful I can't help
I feel stingy everytime I treat myself, so at times this fun rap is really work for me
And at times its got me thinkin what its really worth to me
The school route seemed easier
That probably would have end up pleasin her
Cause these words ain't reachin her
And they damn sure not feedin her
She happy that im happy, thats what a mother supposed to say right? well actually
That be the pride tellin her, her son do no wrong
If music is his passion, she gone rep for’em
Proud mother she is, show me off to her friends
While im tryna show off to mine, in a new benz
So who am I really tryna impress lately?
This persona I walk with got me lookin all crazy

Verse 2

I havnt spoke to my sister in three years
I wonder if she even cares
And if this song she would even hear
It hurts we dont communicate
I got kids, you ain't see they face
Kylee’s beautiful, Cam too
And we all want to tell you, we love you
So feel free to call next time you in town pass through
No hard feelins I dont hate you
Growin up you were the only sibling I knew
You taught me a lot believe that
Our conversations on music I miss that
You was the first to introduce me to Dilla
Until this day I ain't never heard nobody real’a
Dont know why our lives went our seperate ways
I speak to mommy about it and all she say “you know your sister got her ways”
I'm happy to hear your fashion thing pickin up
You just moved and you tryna straighten Braxton up
I know its gotta be hard for a single mother
But always know you can count on your little brother
But dont let the ills of the world pull you under
It takes Patience to be great, thats why momma gave you that name
And if you wonder, I just had to get this off my chest
I couldn't let more time pass without wishin you the best
Oh yeah
