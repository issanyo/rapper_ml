[Verse 1]
Big budget, no mileage on the bucket
Jewels truckin', hoes love it I been thuggin'
Sweat pants, long beard I been rugged
Big bands, .38 Imma tuck it
That little advance yo I spent that on a Cutlass
If it ain't a hundred boy you ain't talking about nothing
Your girl talking sucking so she talking something
I let the passenger seat ride and hit the buttons
Medallion flooded every stone in it flawless
Her whole crew bad, everyone of them is gorgeous
Everyday its either Daytonas or the 4 Gs
I don't date 'em if they ain't doing no orgies
That's so cavalier, Cavalier floor seats
Kyrie Threes, I got 'em before release
Cuban links, i got 'em up out their seats
Frown faces the way that this reefer stinks

[Hook]
I been poppin', tatted up like Dennis Rodman
No bull shit I hit the lot and then I copped it
Inside the whip is like a cockpit
Money ain't an option
Put your money on me, that's a stock tip
Closet stocked with all black like I'm Gothic
30K in each pocket, that's to shop with
Keep my name out your mouth I don't do gossip
30 on the small of my back, bet I pop it

[Verse 2]
Audemar Mondays
Patek Tuesdays
Rolex Wednesdays
Shit I been straight
My watch speak for me
My chain howlin'
My rings solid
My diamonds clear
Your shits cloudy
The fuck you done to those
Your chain tarnished
That ain't rose gold
Fake mafiosos
You ain't copping coco
You ain't seen a boatload
Probably cop the popos
I stay ten toes
Firm in my stance
Earned everyband
Big time smoker
Burned every strand
World traveler
Home where I land, this niggas French
Jeans from Japan
20 ounces on these denims I'm the fucking man
Took a small plan and turned it to my dream job
Muhammad Ali gloves man I beat the odds
Float like a butterfly

[Hook]
I been poppin', tatted up like Dennis Rodman
No bull shit I hit the lot and then I copped it
Inside the whip is like a cockpit
Money ain't an option
Put your money on me, that's a stock tip
Closet stocked with all black like I'm Gothic
30K in each pocket, that's to shop with
Keep my name out your mouth I don't do gossip
30 on the small of my back, bet I pop it
