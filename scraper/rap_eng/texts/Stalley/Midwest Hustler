[Verse 1]
20 gold rose pockets full of coke
Rubber band knots fist full of notes
Send a starter run the [?] like the carter
Push the button from the Porsche a Chevy startup
High beam put it in drive then light the Ganja
Fresh wash when we ride up on ya
Pretty women chose
They just wanna sit and cruise
I told her grab a friend like ma girls are coming too

[Verse 2]
Cuban flooded in Jewls got dweller on the wrist
Multiscale leather sit but still smelling like a brick
Powder in my nails piling up by the inch
8-balls and quarters soft hauled your orders
How would you like to flip
Balls for everybody
The streets get a gift I rolls for everybody
Streets take a sniff hustler till I’m stiff
Black Rolls out the back roads
Crack a seat and it’s

[Verse 3]
Steady are you ready
Are you ready
What’s going on
What’s going on
Steady are you ready
Are you ready
What’s going on
Tell me what’s going on
Even you know when I’m around hustlers
Without feelings or pimps or whatever
They still have some type of family values, morals
So even if I speak about the drugs or the violence or whatever
It’s still always something that speaks to my conscience
About reminding people of the good and the bad
And the outcome that comes with these responsibilities

Gold rush air
Feel the melody that’s in the air
Oh yeah I’m [?]
All this for now
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
What’s going on
