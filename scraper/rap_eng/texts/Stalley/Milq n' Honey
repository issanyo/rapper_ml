At first it wasn't love
Back then thats what it was
I wonder if she still love me?
Because I left the milk for the honey
Me and her we started out as friends
Tell me how it all ends
But I had to get the money
So I left the milk for the honey

Straight gentleman tried to show her new things
Put her on the game and take away from all these lames
But she so closed minded
She think we all the same
Small town girl, typical mind state
Thinks she knows the world
But she never left the gate
And I dont know what she waitin on
But my bags packed and she can wait alone
Can't bring the world back
But you can have these songs
So long
Held strong for so many years
Tryna keep it together, in good faith and little fear that I could do better without you
And when I left I felt dead without you. But that was just my route to success
And now Im out to fufill every dream I shared with you
Hope theres no hard feelings and everything is barable
You said if I make it without you it would be a miricle I find that hysterical So here I go

[Hook]

You dont really care you just want to hold me back
Never down though
Even though everything i've ever done was so I can bring you around a show
Your off till the world glow
Shine like I know you can
You just wanna force my hand
But I'll be damned if I raised mine to you
Unless it was on the stand, telling the judge how I would Kill for you
Stayed loyal when you ran off with other guys
And telling all the other girls I was wearing a disguise
How I lied and cheated on you, and left you with head full of cries
So sometimes I wonder why I care, If you notice I came back there
You can dethrone me from the Kings chair
But we know whos best to sit there
Funny thing is I can never hate you
Your my first love, but I see the cold in your eyes so I can never date you

[Hook]
