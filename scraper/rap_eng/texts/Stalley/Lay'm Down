[Intro: Stalley]
Correct

[Verse 1: Stalley}​​​
Let me talk my ish again, matter fact let me park my whip again
Right on the corner of Michigan
Hanggin with my South Side killas dem dreadlock head dem
Tru Religion suit men, 30 in they boot men
Any man violate, best believe we shoot them
Get your camera zoom lens, watch how we move in
These boys grimy to the root man with loose ends
Two tens in the Monte got the block quakin
As we converse outside over blunts baking
Lots vacant no more, we brought the Chevy's out
Dark nights lit up, (shid) the ice is heavy now
Heavy crown bust down prezi Obama blinging now
I changed up, stay the same for what? That ain't my playing ground
I take this music ish serious, I ain't for playing round
Nigga try to take me out my zone I bet I lay'm down

[Hook: Stalley]
I bet I lay'm down, I guess it was they time
Prayers for they mom but I bet I lay'm down
I gotta lay'm down that's why I'm still around
If it's them or me then I lay'm down

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Overlooked that's what a nigga told me on the net but I'm overbooked and went over last years net gross
I know its disgusting to hear me discussing my wealth
Yeah that's a minor flaw but I have to flex to show you how I ball
Above the rim I'm Gerald Green doin this you never seen
Matter fact you couldn't fathom the type of year that I'm having
Got a new house, new whip, okay never mind the bragging but back to rapping I be snappin bar for bar I'm Kendrick and Cole
But never mentioned when they mention who's cold
I mean I'm top five in that lopsided list that they hold
But that's so narrow minded of me when I envisioned the globe
To hold on to a little pride when not mentioning those
So I sat and I wrote, gave the world quote after quote
And comments came and overlooked was all that they wrote?
Let's be honest man, is this some kind of joke?
Or do I have to take control and go for all these niggas throats for real

[Hook: Stalley]
I bet I lay'm down, I guess it was they time
Prayers for they mom but I bet I lay'm down
I gotta lay'm down that's why I'm still around
If it's me or them then I lay'm down

I bet I lay'm down, I guess it was they time
Prayers for they mom but I bet I lay'm down
I gotta lay'm down that's why I'm still around
If it's me or them, then I lay'm down
