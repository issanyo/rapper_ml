[Intro: Wale]
I done came too far to regard me as the regular
God gave me the flow, Vuitton helped me accessorize

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Straight off the block with it stepping out that Chevrolet
Cooking up over base
Move like I’m walking with an open case
Pockets swoll like I just cracked a safe
Hear these critics talking now, when I see'em open face
Lot of tough talk personas, they ain’t really built for war
Billy-club chainsaw, I’m coming through their front door
They playing with my hustle now, trying to shake my pockets down
My tent say hold your head, don’t let lames bring you down
All I see is don’t change, don’t switch up your style
I’m sending one warning shot then I’m taking buildings down
MMG in the building now, these words we building out
What we hurting feelings now?
They say they want us underground
I’m just bringing ITM mainstream, ain’t that what we started for?
To get ourselves up out that dream, no I’s in team
But everybody’s self-made carved their own names
And we did it our way, Blue Collar Gang all day
Until my flesh hardened so pardon
What you might’ve thought the vision still clear
Different chef, same pot bruh, not Guyanese but..

[Chorus: Tone P]
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I said believe in your dreams
We self-made but never is an I on the team
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
Board of administration, yeah we here to stay
Checkerd flag, DMV BOA

[Verse 2: Black Cobain]
Enemy of the state and their will is overrated
So many mouths to feed, my intuition I made it
Keep safe, don’t keep it a secret, shout out to Vicky
You know when I stroke I’m telling my nigga Slicky
Checkmate, at y’all pace y’all must got a lean diet
Ya weed quiet, you broke, y’all eaten lean pockets
School of the hard knocks with some British knights
How I go from that to Cabernet on first-class flights?
Yeah, did you believe us? You a pessimist
Now these bitches hit a nigga's phone for some S&M
They rooting for me, they say a nigga buzzing
Cause when I win this shit free they think I’m Oprah's cousin
Win free, I don’t think y’all get me
If you keep running your mouth that’s where my dick’ll be
Keanu Reeves, they tell me I’m the one
Only fear death when you staring down a loaded gun

[Chorus: Tone P]
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I said believe in your dreams
We self-made but never is an I on the team
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
Board of administration, yeah we here to stay

[Verse 3: Wale]
Straight up fuck all y’all nigga's talking about that nigga changed shit
As my name get bigger this game get different
Hip-hop for life and fellatio from the wife of anybody who don’t like it
Wale bitch!

To regard me as the regular, God gave me the flow but Vuitton helped me accessorize
Self-awarding, negligence of the less important
And trying to fuck with the flow is like trying to fuck a Mormon
Bitch my message is morbid so my bars is fat
And your problems is little when your bras is fat
Ferragamo im lighting and a nigga card swiping
Abroad flying and bar buying from broad writing
I ain’t tripping, nigga's say that I’m pessimistic
But since Whitley Gilbert and Jada Pinkett my world been different
These hoes thuggin, these nigga's bitches don’t know the difference
Nigga's ain't family guys, these nigga's cold simpsons
Yellow bellies, im LOL'n smoking arrello
Over Patron with Michael Kaj, Rich and Meneli
Let my bitch in the club, got your bitch in the telly
Now that bitch in my Jag, think I’m Tony Boselli
And when money is plenty, a lot of nigga's is friendly
But I’m a grown-ass man, you nigga's is telly
Uh, kid shit, BOA shit nigga deal wit it

[Chorus: Tone P]
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I said believe in your dreams
We self-made but never is an I on the team
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
I got that cook-up cook-up (Hah-Hah)
Board of administration, yeah we here to stay
