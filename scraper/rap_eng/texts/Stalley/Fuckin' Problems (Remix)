[Intro: Rick Ross]
We the greatest ever nigga
MMG, yeah

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Here it come, there it goes, guess I'm rolling up the marijuana
Well known as the boss, it's the bottle popping
Talking down, she wanna ball like Cyndi Lauper
I get the cheddar here, baby girl a blood but she kinda cute
Let a nigga gang bang in the found blue (Su-woo)
Red beamer and it's brand new
So shout out to the bitches we done ran through
True connoisseur carnivores, to the whores
Yeah you running with the flow, it wasn't yours
All the boss got butter, it's all gold
Stalley showed it to me first now fast forward
The land lord my influence, is speaking Jewish
Need to get you some insurance for smoking too much
This shit a movie pick a theater in the crib
And you know I got the pole, we get it in, we get it in

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Speeding in my fast car, reminiscing on the girl that I last saw
And how she cut wood like a hacksaw, wax on wax off man that ass soft
Attached to my fitted, but I get that kitten hat soft
I was jimmy hat strapped when I fell up in that cat: pause
All over my body, me on for my yoning balls had the head down
Tails up like a coin toss rolling up a body
Stretching like Pilate, 110 Maserati
Burning down the highway, burning on some Marley
Could this be love infatuation of the body?
The facts is that I'm sloppy with my feelings and it's got me
Chasing love at six in the morning, horny as a dog in heat chasing after pony
The streets is lonely, but it's just me and the stars
Me and my thoughts, could it be me and the Goddess?
Well if I play my cards right, tarot cards on my dashboard if they re-write
Or leave me right back to my queen tonight, right?

[Chorus: 2 Chainz & Drake]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
(I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
