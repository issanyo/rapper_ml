Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Under lampposts and street lights
Stomachs ache, we ain't eat right
Mama working two jobs, so she barely sleeping at night
Daddy ain't seen 'em in years
And last time we spoke he was gone on them beers
High off that rock
Holdin' back his tears
Cause he felt his family turn a slave to the drugs
And lost his sanity and walked out on his kids
But I told him keep his head up, I understand what he did
It's a lot of pressure when you're under pressure with very limited ends
But it ain't how you it started
It's all about how it ends
You told me that as man we never break for the bend
We from the bottom and that dirt we absorb it
Only polish our skin
Hard work is what they commend
So take them hard ships on the chin
Never grin or turn a frown
Or put your head down to them
You're a king, poor or rich
A living testament to these kids so all your dreams
Live it out for them
Get from under that street light
Away from the street life
And be that light out for them

[Hook: Rashad]
No matter how you get this paper
They working 9 to 5s where I live
No, I ain't you never been a hater
But there's more than one way to feed these kids
Blue Collar gang yeah
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea
Blue collar gang
Elevate the game, Blue Collar Gang yea

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Everybody's hustling to make it
I spoke to my OG he said hustling's overrated
Everybody's chasing dreams but dreams are what you make it
Life is what you make it also and all your decision's gon' cost ya
So choose your life wisely, I'm throwin' dice, ivory
Side betting all my chances no set back no advances
No silver spoons or pamperin'
Soon as you see the dirt you gotta stick both hands in it
I'm gettin' high tryna cancel it
Cold world with no J
It's hard work with no play
9 to 5 or sell yay
I respect it either way
Blue collar, no handouts
Genius so I stand out
I'ma make my own way
Even if I gotta to lay my own land down
Ten toes to the ground, nose to the sky
Royalty in my eyes, I'll never fall to the pride
Or be deprived of my blessings or question life lessons
It's hard work to be a star first and a positive man second

[Hook]

[Outro x2]
Playa haters, rhyme sayers and heartbreakers
Slick talkers and British Knights and Skywalkers
Street hustlers always showing they new dollars
Who's hotter? Who to follow we Blue Collar
