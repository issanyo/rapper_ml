[Intro:]
O-O-O-Ohio

[Hook: Rashad]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle (chevelle)
Chevelle, you know me well (know me well)
Got me gassing you up, taking you out on the town
Poppin' the trunk, showing you off
So sexy when your top's down

[Verse 1:]
I just wanna show you off to the whole world
Make everyone mad, especially my old girl
I ain't gassin' when I say you're my only girl
Those new shoes and new coach, you better go girl
Go girl, you know this your world
You're so thorough, twerk for me, that talk is so real
Made of steel, my superwoman, for real
I spend four bills just to make that ass fat
And put four twelves in it to make that ass clap
Now you're booming, yeah you're booming, how I like it
You stay clean but that bubble gum light [scent?]
Dark tin, our alone time is well spend
[?] The city cruising on the rode trips
You're my ride or die, my down ass chick
My first crush, my first love, since a little ass kid
I hung posters of you, hoping one day, I'll get
A chance to show you how deep this love for you is

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
She's so systematic, she's so afrocentric
She's so black and strong, she's so wide and long
She won't ever let me get lost, she loves to take control
But yeah she knows who's the boss and she loves when I floss
Round the city, top down, flashin' the [?]
Big blunts burning, smoke flowing, like an exhaust
Engine purring, cat wet, feel the bass and like that
A fishtail she throw it right back, she love when I get under her
Grip the wheel and talk to her, her skin so soft and comfortable
She do whatever I want her to, the whole city in love with her
Kids cuddle around her, pointing at her curve
Telling me 'I can't wait to get older and find a girl like yours'
They wanna sit inside and listen to all her words
Her volume loud, I bet your father smilin' down on us
The first time I took you out we sat by the [?]
Conversing all night long, listening to LaVere

[Hook]

[Outro: Rashad]
Chevelle, chevelle, chevelle chevelle
Chevelle, you know me well (you know me well)
Girl you know me well, girl you know me well (Oooh)
