[Verse 1: Stalley]
Correct
It's a four alarm blaze
M70 jacket with the black cat J's
Playing the bag puffin' the black and cafes
I'm back on my passed days
Soakin' up the jazz, sing
Blue notes, two totes, then I pass the J
Sip Yak for my niggas that done passed away
Middle America tryna tell but cash clay, they said I couldn't make it
Middle finger what they say
Loud mouth, closed ears
Don't hear them anyway
I talk the Midwest blues on top of center stage
Ain't no hope for a nigga that staying true these days
But they respect it when you roll up letting Uzis spray
My Uzi way of tongue
All black tiger stripes, reppin' where I'm from
BCG medallion still shining in the sun
So who gon' take me outta mind? Not a coward here
Stay successful, nigga, that's how I counter fear
Never cried over spilt milk, try and count a tear
HaHa nigga, dry eyes niggas
So you can keep hatin' until you crawl up and die, niggas
It's my time, toast fine wine over steaks prime
The best lyrics is out, they ain't even reach my prime
I'm just pacing it out like Paul George
Come to collect everything, oh
Plus more
And if you decide to jump in the way
I'll take yours
Money-blockers, cock-blockers, nothing I hate more
Keep loyal guys around, never date a whore, that's what I
Was brought upon by wise OGs
Getting not take the charge
Never snitch on codees
Chevy's ain't cold unless they sittin' on these
The only time I've been this
Is when I pray on the knees
So foldin' ain't an option
Always got my work off
Holdin' ain't an option, coulda went to school, got a doctrine
Instead I got in the booth cause crack got it rockin'
I'm just a natural hustler, that's how I got here, I put my soul on
Ice until i'm not here
Victorian cribs with the rockin' chair
Spaceship in the drive-way, a modern day rocketeer
And no man who built an Empire from collect cars
To collect cars with thin tires
Or acres of land, got it all my own
No deals, no shaking's of hands, just a lot persistence and excellent plans
No rewards if I ain't work for it, and it ain't worth anything if
You ain't hurt for it, Now it's sweet victory
Check the scoreboard [2x]
Highscore

[Outro: Stalley]

And i've been doing this for years, i've never switched up
I'm only switching gears
Spectacular hits cause i'm something different here
Rocket man takes off
One, one, one...
