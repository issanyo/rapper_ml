[Intro]
While I'm freedom fighting they non violent..
While I'm freedom fighting they non violent..

[Verse 1]
Arm raised, fist tight nigga
Militant man say goodbye to the polite nigga
Go ahead, hate on me, make my plight bigger
Or you can roll with me, and make this fight bigger
We mashin on, hold on to your boots
I'm getting back to black, climbing through my roots
From the soil to the poe, rags to riches writing note
How the story go, now I'm toe to toe with the heartless
I rub shoulders with bosses, No-shorts no-loses
Write soul from the bottom to the tops expect it
And no new homies, that's for the record
For y'all that thought you ran with me
Respect it or check it, so when I enter hit the exits
This your party right? Well I'm dancing reckless
Letting it go tonight, they say I'm acting like I lost my mind. Nope just woke up this morning, feeling like a new man
Looking in the mirror like where the hell you been when you said

[Hook]
I gotcha back, You got my back
While I'm freedom fighting they non violent, stand there and jus watch us bleed, canâ€™t understand it (x2)

[Verse 2]
They throwing stones at my poems trying to crucify me
Hang me up and throw the noose around me
Feeling like I'm being hosed down with dogs around me
But it's only pig faced hogs around me
Watching while I'm fighting for what they believe in
Envying how I create, cause they scared to just be them
A lot of mass, yep, there's a lot of mass going
Trying to tell them that fake ish don't last long
So if doing me don't work the front, I'll pass on
These sticks and stones that break bones
Couldn't stop my march, even with them casts on
Now run-a-long, pass along, as I stand alone
Fighting for my passion
These other rappers watch, want me be a martyr for their freedom but I leave them right where they stand
Ain't no reason to lead them if they don't wanna be a man
Take a stand for something that you can be proud of at the end and understand

[Hook]
I gotcha back, You got my back
While I'm freedom fighting they just all just stand there
And just watch us bleed, can't understand it
While I'm freedom fighting they just all just stand there and just watch us bleed, can't understand it
