[Verse 1]
I'm smoked out, I'm Baped out
Got Jordans on that ain't out
And I'm spaced out in my own world
Ain't worried what they hatin' bout
I'm leanin'
Walking around with the heathens
Tryin' to escape these demons
Been losing all my life
Now I just want to break even
Been rushing all my days
Now I just want to take it easy
I'm tired of proving myself
To everyone who don't believe me
I told them I was gonna make it
Even the blind gonna see me
Now I'm living the life
You only witness on TV
Lights, camera, action, repeat
I do it for the homies laying six feet
Pray they clear their sins before they laughing watching over me
God if you listening tell them niggas smile for me
Cause I'm getting it, really living how I'm sposed to be
I overcame the struggle and all that evil taking over me
Thats valued over a dollar
Now that why I'm living comfortable

(Break)

That's why I'm living comfortably
That's why I'm living comfortably
That's why I'm living comfortably

[Verse 2]
All those headaches and heartaches
All the hard times I hardly
Remember catching any breaks
(?)
My pops could not make bail
Left my mom with all the bills
Talking stress
We was stressed out for real I was depressed
Like one day I'm gonna help momma
And daddy better not stick out his hand
Unless he reaching for a comma
That soft spot in my heart
Been covered up with iron armor
That can't be pierced by God's son
Holy Father or the Virgin Mary
Mama said i'm like my daddy thats a little scary
I told her I will never leave you girl, so don't worry
Cause i'm not like him
I mean he got good qualities
I'm just not like him
I mean he got good qualities
I'm just not like him
Apple don't fall far from the tree if the branch don't bend
Federal, state, or county I mean what branch he in?
Typical story right?
Single mother trying to raise a young boy right
Well mama you did that
And for that I owe you more than life
I'm smoked out and I'm baked out
Got joints on that A now
And I'm spaced out in my own world
Ain't worried what they hatin' bout
I'm leanin'
Walking around with the heathens
Tryin' to escape these demons
Been losing all my life
Now I just want to break even
Been rushing all my days
Now I just want to take it easy
