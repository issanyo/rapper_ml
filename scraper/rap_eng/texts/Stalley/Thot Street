[Hook]
I’m undressing you with my eyes tonight
You so fly, let’s get high, take a ride tonight
I can’t lie, like to have you by my side tonight
Bitch I’m looking in your eyes and your vibe is right
Yeah your vibe is right
Now we’re smoking, and it’s so hot I had to crack my window open
Both know in a little bit Imma be stroking
I’m licking that, and I’m sticking that, and I’m poking
You’re mines tonight

[Verse 1]
Look, I got a New York bitch on the runway
Never let me fuck her on Sunday
She just really want to get high
Never was a fan of the gunplay
Had the bitch rolling up the one way
Didn’t make ho go crazy
When I come around all the money come down
Nigga dick make your ho pay me
All I really wanted was the head right quick
But she got me like let me count the bread right quick
Pedal to the metal, see she won a gold medal
By the way she got away from the feds right quick
I don’t give a fuck if you like that bitch
You should take this trip, Imma dyke that bitch
Slide to Miami, introduce her to the family
Still couldn’t pay me to wife that bitch
Hold up, stop, let me light this bitch
Tell me how you feel, young nigga too real
Some say I changed ever since I got a deal
Put a condom on your hot boy, fuck how you feel
Bitch we smoking
And you so hot I had to crack my window open, her pussy smoking

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Stalley]
I ain’t no drug dealer, she ain’t no junkie neither
This ain’t no [?], don’t be no deep breather
Watch where them ashes fall, these ain’t cheap sneakers
The chop like meat cleavers, on that cutlass
Tryna cut ya like a butcher, believe this
[?] on my kingus, got abundance of hoes I swing with
Word to H-town, my [?] high, my bass loud
I cock the hood, she put her face down
Sloppy head on highways, she chasing up where my thighs weigh
She drop the top, I drop the ceiling
She mine tonight, like Carl Wilson
That head she give is a night starter
I park in the dark in the back of the park
[?] stroke them like [?], she drunk in love like Mrs. Carter
No [?], when I’m hitting, just shit screaming [?]
