[Verse 1]
Hop up out the bed
Hit the weed get my mind right
Blessed to see another day past 25
All praise to the most high
Put that on my Jordan 5
Grab my shine, then I'm off in my bow tie
Scrapin', scrapin'
I'm off in these streets
Gettin' paper what the hell you thinkin'
I be on a solo mission, photo flickin'
Why you hatin'
I just want the world to see me shine
Give 'em motivation
Staying in my own lane
I ain't out here holdin' races
Ain't no competition
Don't compare me to these other faces
My uniqueness got me peakin'
Other niggas can't keep peace with
I don't hear 'em they don't say ish
I be in my own world
Cruising in my spaceship
Fly talk what I'm known for
Imma check the score board
I been training all these years for this
Body so sore
My endurance up
Got my pockets on overload
I stay on my grind but never satisfied
I need more and more
More and more

[Hook]
Smoke one, smoke two
Smoke three, 3D
Two freaks, grand prix
Ooh wee, four peat
Smoke one, smoke two
Smoke three, 3D
Two freaks, grand prix
Ooh wee, four peat

[Bridge]
As we
Proceed
As we
Proceed to give you what you need
As we
Proceed
As we
Proceed to give you what you need

[Verse 2]
More knowledge more dollars
I'm a blue strip addict
About my scratch no static
Designer shoe fine fabric
The foreign coupe is pandered
I drop the roof and stand up
Like Pac out in Apollo
I blow smoke in Impalas
I grab a pen, thoughts follow
A smooth criminal scholar
At 15 moved (?)
That's what we called it then
Smaller Benz, G series shine Jerry Cortez
Post in front of granny's house like some porch heads
The game we was force fed
Nurtured by the hustlers
Share weight by the customers
I'm doing it with music
Ain't one different from the other one
Born to gross dividends
Can't smoke 'less you put in
Some goes for the road I paved
With my own foot in

[Hook]
Smoke one, smoke two
Smoke three, 3D
Two freaks, grand prix
Ooh wee, four peat
Smoke one, smoke two
Smoke three, 3D
Two freaks, grand prix
Ooh wee, four peat
