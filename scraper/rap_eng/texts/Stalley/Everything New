[Hook: Stalley]

Pulling tricks up out my bag
XK on the Jag
Peeling back them tags
Everything new
The feeling never gets old
Yellow gold watch
Everything, everything new
Driven from my fingers
Always a gentleman, always distinguished
Everything, everything new
Think like a heathen
Speak like a genius
Money on wheels
Everything, everything new

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Coupe on steel like a brinks is
Funny how you think this
Came over night though
Just came through the right door
Now they’re trying to push me left
I’m trying to get it right more
Some days I think I’m loony or some kind of psycho
Haters got me back to
Loading up this rifle
I’m thinking that I might go
Duck hunting trunk bumping something get me hype mode
Cruising through your block slow

[Hook: Stalley]

[Verse 2: Stalley]

And I could take it over but I’m thinking about a lot more
And everything is not for
Me I be honest, but I’mma try to get it all on
G, I’ll be on it
I can feel the money coming palms itch
This is just the calm before the storm gets
Crazy dollar bills fall, pay me get my charms lit
Aston Martin car man
Young nigga, old heads mad cause they lost it
I did it like a boss did
Them loyalties never crossed it

[Hook: Stalley]

[Hook: Stalley]

Everything, everything new
Everything, everything new

[Verse 3: Stalley]

She want everything too
Coats about that zoo
Mink and fur full lynx, gator on that shoe
She got haters on her too
They be coming out the blue
What the hell you gonna do
When everything new
Just keep quiet and let that money talk (for two)
Get the hell up in this two seater then we
Sweep through this city like a broom
This city mind it till I lay up in that tomb
Then I pass it on to you
