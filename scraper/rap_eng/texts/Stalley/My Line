[Pre-Chorus]
Dont call my phone you ain't talkin’ about nothing
Don’t interrupt my conversation
We ain’t got nothing to talk about unless you callin’ to talk about some paper
Want them racks in the rubberbands
I’m trying to ball just like Jordan in Concords
So I’m calling that bullshit
‘Cause anything else, ain't got time for

[Chorus]
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain't talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Get off my line
Bitches ain’t talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain’t talking about nothin’
You ain’t talk about nothin’
Bitches ain’t talkin’ about nothin’
Niggas ain’t talkin’ about nothin’

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Cell phone jumping (ring)
Everybody and their momma on me
I been up counting money since about five in the morning
No time for interruptions
Fill the goyard with the hundreds
Silencers on the MAC
All my youngins down to punch shit
My Saint Laurent slim fit
My jewels as wet as water
My car look like a spaceship
Getting this money ain't a problem
The problem is all these lying kids, wanna talk like they got it
Don't call, text, or email, or hit my line private

[Pre-Chorus]
Dont call my phone you ain't talkin’ about nothing
Don’t interrupt my conversation
We ain’t got nothing to talk about unless you calling to talk about some paper
Want them racks in the rubberbands
I’m trying to ball just like Jordan in Concords
So I’m calling that bullshit
‘Cause anything else, ain't got time for

[Chorus]
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain't talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Get off my line
Bitches ain’t talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain’t talking about nothin’
You ain’t talk about nothin’
Bitches ain’t talkin’ about nothin’
Niggas ain’t talkin’ about nothin’

[Verse 2: Offset]
Yo conversation is irrelevant
Yo from Texas, I'm sipping on medicine
I got the white girl, Jennifer Aniston
They see me in 'Raris, and they get to panicking
Giuseppe steppin', I'm fresher than mannequins
My diamonds gonna shine like a light on a ambulance
And I got bricks of canned yams
Smokin on shit come from Amsterdam

[Quavo]
Dont call my phone you ain't talkin’ about nothing
Don’t interrupt my conversation
I'm talking to blue bitches, what Migos want
Quavo got boats on the water
She whipping that china, she look like Kimora
Can't talk to mean bitches, annoying
I ride for my niggas, I know that they loyal
I beating that pot like I'm Rampage
Black 'sace shades, Johnny Cage
Wish a nigga would, try to take a nigga sack
My niggas want blood like blades
Young nigga work for Infinity
You not talking about nothing, get away from me
Gold on my faucet and toilet seat
You know it's gonna cost you a rack to pee

[Pre-Chorus]
Dont call my phone you ain't talkin’ about nothing
Don’t interrupt my conversation
We ain’t got nothing to talk about unless you callin’ to talk about some paper
Want them racks in the rubberbands
I’m trying to ball just like Jordan in Concords
So I’m calling that bullshit
‘Cause anything else, ain't got time for

[Chorus]
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain't talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Get off my line
Bitches ain’t talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain’t talking about nothin’
You ain’t talk about nothin’
Bitches ain’t talkin’ about nothin’
Niggas ain’t talkin’ about nothin’

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Can't fuck with you niggas, can't fuck with you bitches
Cause all that they want is your riches
I can't trust you niggas, I can't trust you bitches
So I keep a K in the kitchen
Run in my kitchen and think that I'm slipping
My nigga you gonna come up missing
Really it's suicide that you committed
Talking my swag, we invented
All of my niggas they about the Benjis
Whatever they want, they go get it
If it's the action maybe go to Billy
Yo bitch in the kitchen, naked, washing dishes
I whip a milli but came from a Bentley
I keep a FN in with an extension
You just a soldier, call me the Lieutenant ?
I keep the boot on me, not talking about Timberlands

[Pre-Chorus]
Dont call my phone you ain't talkin’ about nothing
Don’t interrupt my conversation
We ain’t got nothing to talk about unless you callin’ to talk about some paper
Want them racks in the rubberbands
I’m trying to ball just like Jordan in Concords
So I’m calling that bullshit
‘Cause anything else, ain't got time for

[Chorus]
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain't talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Get off my line
Bitches ain’t talking about nothing (talking bout nothing)
Hoe get off my line
Niggas ain’t talking about nothin’
You ain’t talk about nothin’
Bitches ain’t talkin’ about nothin’
Niggas ain’t talkin’ about nothin’
