[Intro: Sample: (?)]
Right now we'd like to continue with
A composition by yours truly

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Another day, another dollar gone
Another prayer gone
Another scar to place this wish upon
I sit and listen long as I sift through songs
To place my burden on
Hope one day the world will relate to Stalley on
A gift from (?)
A city where young tigers put their stripes on
Hustling from sun up until the light is gone
Nothing weak about them, everyone is crazy strong
Look at me, nothing about me made wrong
They said I left him alone
I don't come home much
I stay shouting BK, its like I lost touch
All I do is brag and boast
When all I'm trying to do is make it better for those with no hopes
Who see good athletes turn into dopes
I'm out here up against the ropes for my little city
So when you see me swinging in my blades
Know every single one of y'all is with me
So tip your plastic cups and light your haze
Its for my niggas on opies
Imma make sure (?) town seen better days

[Hook: Jade]
And when it gets old, it gets old
And when it gets cold, it gets cold
I'm looking for those sunrays
And better days, better days, better days
Its sunny outside

And when it gets old, it gets old
And when it gets cold, it gets cold
I'm looking for those sunrays
And better days, better days, better days
Its sunny outside

[Verse 2: Stalley]
We cry
Then laugh at struggle
Then get up
Go hard
Then scrape up knuckles
We define hustle as crack rock
In the black box
And building with the mind muscle
Street relics
We black, whatchu trying to tell us
Since slavery the mind has been rebellious
Could never nail us
Try and cross us
Get tossed and held dust
They said hell's for us
We could never see heaven
Everyday I look up
Shorties getting battered and cuffed up
So maybe its out of reach
Or maybe its just us we yelling
As they try and judge us
Brainwash our thinking
Cause niggas ain't really been free
Thanks anyway Lincoln
Tweny-eight presidents later a change gon' come
At least I hope that's what he's really thinking

[Hook: Jade]
And when it gets old, it gets old
And when it gets cold, it gets cold
I'm looking for those sunrays
And better days, better days, better days
Its sunny outside

And when it gets old, it gets old
And when it gets cold, it gets cold
I'm looking for those sunrays
And better days, better days, better days
Its sunny outside
