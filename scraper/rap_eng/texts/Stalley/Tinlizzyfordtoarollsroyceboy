[Intro: Stalley]
Tin Lizzy Ford to a Rolls Royce boy
A bumpy ride turned smooth
In the fast lane we cruise
We ghetto, this life we didn't choose
From the get-go we never settled
Why should you?

[Verse: Stalley]
I used to be influenced by a hustler with a chain
Now I'm influenced by a man asking for some change
I used to pray for riches, now all I want is change
Like Obama man, I'm trying to do the right thing
For my momma's sake
She don't wanna see her son boxed and confined and chained
My pops, he already did that man
Filled with marijuana and cocaine veins
Not a chip off my old man
See these malt liqours (?)
Man how can we escape this lane
I'm telling my young folks sometimes that cool ish is really lame
See I sat back and peeped game
Twenty years and nothing changed
I could have kept my diary blank and still maintained
Cause its all the same
Its a recurring stress, I tried the cess, I tried to rest
I never fell so I'm next to sell
I'm playing life 'til there's nothing left
Its still hard even though I know the test
As long as I give my all and put my best
Everything else, is god blessed
In life nothing's ever really hard pressed
I really address for my niggas with fear bubbling in their chest
We got it now let's
Evreything's a reason to stop heron thinking
Cause homies are leaving and families are grieving
And I can't stop speaking about what I'm seeing
I wanna pop bottles and throw money around for no apparent reason
To express my wealth
Cause I'm from the hood and I like to live good
I just choose to speak and do well when its time to express myself
When its time to express myself
Express myself
Express myself
Express myself
Express myself
Express myself
Express myself

[Outro: (?)]
You don't know
What love is
Ooh ooh ooh
You don't know
What love is
Ooh ooh ooh
