[Verse 1]
I felt the winter wind in my july skin
Every hair on my arm started rising
Heard the beat so I decided to dive in
It was sounding so funky in my high end
Both speaker headphones lyrics to go
Navigate you on your way home, baby let's go
Through the corridors of my cerebral
See a little action, see some Malenko
Crowded alleys from where we was letting the weed blow
Stick up kids sunk low in my Regal
Trying to find a remote local
This is time for the now, god bless a child
Thats daddy's own
Cause we was still searching trying to find our way home
Thats why each verse is more than a poem
Every word is a step deep in mind
When we babbling we traveling, we can take our time

[Hook x2]
Traveling, unravelling, rambling on
When we travel, never stopping, keeping it going on
The words are strong, my word is bond
So lets roll along in Babylon

[Verse 2]
So you can relax and settle on in
My mellow, my man, my ace, my friend
You are now rocking with a non-complacent man
So I guess we not settling
Speech so comfortable without peddling
G5 a fix, yeh no ride is better than
The one you on right now, we above light now
Out of mind is out of space, this is far out
Doom yet quite wild, this is like an amazing class trip
Mixed with a bad acid hit, stalely classic shit
As we flip through the pages of the brain
It starts seeming more insane
The things that once looked familiar
All have changed
As it all spills out, we recognise real how
It should be expressed out

[Hook x2]
