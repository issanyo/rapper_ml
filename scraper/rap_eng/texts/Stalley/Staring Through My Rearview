[Intro]
Right now it feels like is me against the world (Made back music)
Honestly, like am by myself, you know am saying?

[Verse 1]
Pity you pussy niggas flying on my down for
Never satisfying until them things going off
G-Q's best dress niggas of di year
Need to yell out the state, how they volunteer
Caught in traffic, but they never caught me slipping in it
You bitch, your nother mistress nigga, but don't get offended
The beef dead, now am moving on to bigger business
Bullet holes in your bust, but who benefit'n
The first song I wrote I did it whipping in the kitchen
Soon as you get the pretty cars, then you come in killing
Take your soul, then they sell it on the black market
Lost walking silk road, just another talking
Award, tours, but the tribe still on a  quest
Put out your cigarettes nigga when we be on the set
Heart of a soldier so, go tell your management
I have us bowing heads niggas with the candles lit
Call﻿ Adele a couples times, I got the voice mail
But you being on a line, I get a boy chills
Sitting in a corner by myself I hear the voice clip
Cross the Queens bridge, nigga bout a fourth gear
Box on my ankle,  every night I plug it up
Asking my lawyer, possibly could they be bugging us
Never envy an artist as they reach their pinnacle
Motivation came from everything we do
Walk away from a scholarship and I bought a brick
Everybody bet against me cause they thought I'd miss
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
Bet the right back on my dick, I say this number fith
(Made back music) It’s the boss Young Rezio
R.I.P 2Pac, my nigga west coast
Much love, huh

[Chorus]
I got a hundred mill to pill through
You ain't fucking with devil, I can’t feel you
At the top looking down, that’s the crib view
Riding in the wave, niggas staring at the rear view
I got a hundred mill to pill through
You ain't fucking with devil, I can’t feel you
Correct

[Verse 2]
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot
Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot
Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot
Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Homes of fatherless sons tryna fill that void
They screaming for help but the trap always kill that noise
They whipping and na-na, they whipping together yeh yeah
They think over the stove is how you whip up a pay day
So they talk
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot
Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Money, women and drugs, that’s all these niggas talk
Ain’t these fans are concern bout what they nigga bought
But in another herd, a 14 year old getting shot
Clangs man, cops, these cowards tryna kill us off
Homes of fatherless sons tryna fill that void
They screaming for help but the trap always kill that noise
They whipping and na-na, they whipping together yeh yeah
They think over the stove is how you whip up a pay day
So they talk and they rats like this shit is for pay plan
No niggas do a numbers, and a fans for fist scale
You niggas don't even know the numbers on when the breaks out
No bells for my partners but these cops walking
And all you niggas wanna rap about is how you block popping
Bumping, am gonna war righteous with the stock option
Am over timing these streets, Ain't no clock stopping
Mari-tones to this peace﻿ among my comrades
Screaming out free my nigga, being still he come back
Justice for Tamer and posted up like a thunb tac
On my waist, I got one gat
I show you the real purpose of a firearm
A cop kill another innocent black, and we fire on him
Writing on him, rear view to that bullshit you inspire doing
Minds are ruin, we black hold in that capsule
Pill poppers became the new leaders, that's sad Joe
Little preacher from Stalli, maybe ain't that bad though
Peace power the pot, or P Malcolm
Am down for the revolution no matter the outcome
No matter the outcome

[Outro]
December 4th, December 4th, December 4th
Black market,black market, black market
Ricky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know stalli)
Ricky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know stalli)
Ricky Rosey, Double Lim (You already know stalli)
(You already know stalli), you already know stalli)
I got a hundred mill to pill through
You ain't fucking with devil, I can’t feel you
Let me hold that Ferarri my nigga
At the top looking down, that’s the crib view
Riding in the wave, niggas staring at the rear view
I got a hundred mill to pill through
You ain't fucking with devil, I can’t feel you
