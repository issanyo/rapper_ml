[Hook: Stalley]
These young niggas got that Kevin Hart
They wasn't ready
Cheap tellies, beer bellies, and Pelle-Pelle's
Five star tellies, fish tummies, ain't ish you can tell me
Tell me, tell me an issue, tell me tell me
Quiet money, thought I was hungry
They on a perc, I'm on Pirelli's
Got the candy paint
Now these niggas jelly
Whatchu gon' tell me, really?

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Old Durangos with Kangols, I'm on some player ish
In the streets hustle hard, on my Maino ish
Born ready, the boy ready, nothing to tangle with
Middle of things, beautiful wife, word to that single kid
When it comes to mic fights I'm know to strangle shit
Don't try and size me up, line me up, no angles with
No slip, my hold on life is vice grip
Run a tight ship like aye aye captain
Sailor shades, close tailor made fly guy caption
This is life, this beyond my rapping
This is jogging for your jaw flapping
Summertime fall fashion, I'm cooler than most
I smoke to the roach, no joint passing
I'm passenger seat macking while my shorty slide past him
She bat lashes, I cut up Kalila, spark more reefer
BCG medallion on my neck for the non-believers
Rose from the soil, I'm that kind of creature
Used to write in empty rooms
Now I line the bleachers

[Hook: Stalley]
These young niggas got that Kevin Hart
They wasn't ready
Cheap tellies, beer bellies, and Pelle-Pelle's
Five star tellies, fish tummies, ain't ish you can tell me
Tell me, tell me an issue, tell me tell me
Quiet money, thought I was hungry
They on a perc, I'm on Pirelli's
Got the candy paint
Now these niggas jelly
Whatchu gon' tell me, really?

[Verse 2: Stalley]
In all honesty, the flows gully I been anointed
The one chosen to kick game like Neymar
Was low key, now I'm back on everybody's radar
The ones sleep, I don't pay y'all no mind
I still shine like the brightest light source, divine
Intervention, my suspension got my Chevy sitting high
Not to mention I be riding with my angel on the side
Angel on the front of the car, illuminate through the night
Shark white smile, tell the haters pipe down
Been at it for a while, I ain't going nowhere
You niggas so square
Guess you ain't shaked up the last
Heavy investors superceding my past
Y'all still scraping for cash
Never been a slave to the dollar and I'm thankful for that
This music got me out the trap so I'm thankful for rap
Faithful to the faithful addicts so I base up on tracks
And cook up another classic, then serve them a batch

[Hook: Stalley]
These young niggas got that Kevin Hart

Tell me, tell me an issue, tell me tell me
Quiet money, thought I was hungry
They on a perc, I'm on Pirelli's
Got the candy paint
Now these niggas jelly
