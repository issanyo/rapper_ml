[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
More precious is me, more diamonds 'round my neck
If you not gonna anoint me king, give respec'
Underrated they say it like it's a good thing
That ain't a compliment when accomplishing your dreams
Tryna' undermine the mastermind and not crown the king
The benevolent who level lift
Bump who you rep
I'm a [?] this and bottle it
Fronted like I was good money but all those thoughts were counterfeit
I took some jabs and counted it
Still affirming my beliefs took all the pain and mounted it
Up against the wall like a vision board
And use it as my motivation, cultivate it a lot but envision more
Curate an aventador
Who made it out the slums without a brick of raw
Shooting my shot, to the top, ain't throw a brick at all
They say it's all time and Allah, won't be a minute off
Several round unlike mines so I sent it off
Switch my patterns, different fabrics, cut from a different cloth
As the world turns like these goldies
As the... burns from this [?] leaf
Cut way different leaf, we can't sit with them
My soul cries out dawg, I get that feeling when
Just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkz
I'm just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkz
Just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkz
Stakes is high, the weed got me higher
Cool as fire amplifying through the wire
A decorative belligerent
Hot temperament, don't get caught in a cross fire
Or burn a bridge, my bad side ain't courage
Throw you off the side and don't anchor...
Keep selling my propellin' out your grid
World traveller, lyric babeller
Ain't no telling where I been
Heart snatcher, soul grabber
These words sinking in your skin?
It's like a cleanser, exfolliatin'
I turn that hate into motivation
I'm still here, now that's admiration
You gotta applaud that appreciation
Don't be appaulled at it, ... made it
Where's the adulation?
What I'm doing is extraordinary, nothing basic
Jordan 12's, few games yeah I'm known to play sick
Yeah my disposition ain't never been complacent
Yeah I mean you're faced with it
As the world turns like these goldies
As the... burns from this [?] leaf
Cut way different leaf, we can't sit with them
My soul cries out dawg, I get that feeling when
Just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkzz
I'm just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkz
Just trying to keep my shhhh together like these Gucci Linkz
