[Chanting]
Obie, Obie, Obie...

[Talking]
State of Ohio, man, this is it, this is the mecca right here
Yeah I live in Massillon. Proud about it, you know?
Somebody say oh, I'm fro- I'm from New York
So I'm from Massillon

3, 3, 0
3, 3, 0
3, 3, 0
Here we- Here we go
3, 3, 0

[Verse 1]
Call my city out they coming with me
And we gon' dog this bitch and split it up 50-50
Scout's honor, I'm a bomber unified
No fingers crossed, no hands tied
I'm bout to knock these weak niggas off the earth
Got em' by a landslide
No tear shed, cut them feelings off, it's ok to be
Proud how I rep for y'all, salute, pause, cock back, and let the weapons off
For a rebel with an f-ing cause I set bars for rappers out that cold
So please step it up
Not a man on the moon, this ground I step on be where this classic nigga groom
I bloom from the cracks then get it movin from them corners with them gats
Had gasoline dreams, and still lit a match
Chevy with the hats, Jordan fitted the only thing that match
Midwest, yep
Yee ain't know, I be the supreme, throw them up
And flagrant niggas giving away too many free throws
I'm already up, scoreboard shows, winner
Swoosh

[Chorus]
(330)
What I rep to the death of me
And when you see me, its gon' always be
(330)
Where I came from, out that dirt
And got my game from
(330)
What I rep to the death of me
And when you see me, its gon' always be
(330)
Where I came from, out that dirt
And got my game from

[Verse 2]
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Cause we be on our own ish
Furs and gators for that cold ish
Tank tops and Dickie shorts for hot summers
On 16th where the dice tumbles
Blanket special so you might wonder, if it's cool to bend these corners
It is and but it ain't, cause them youngins be upon yas
So don't get too much in comfort
Cause they always gonna wonder, what you come for, then dump you
Now let me bring it back to the peaceful side, where the pride lies heavy on me
Name a nigga that done did it like me
Took the Milq and made it famous, shooting for the top aimless
Taking out whoever ain't with the- (330)
That's on my soul, I got it jumping like it's 6'4", let's go Ohio
The representation you been waiting for
We here now, apologies if you waited long

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers
Where I came from
Got so much pride in them 3 numbers


Ohio stand up, O-o-ohio stand up
