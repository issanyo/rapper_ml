[Verse 1]
Over here I'm original
You can put your money on me I'm about to go digital
Just watch me turn nothing into something keep it jumpin'  y'all don't hear me though
Used to try to treat a young nigga, like a nigga was invisible
Now I'm feeling invicible
'Cuz over here I'm original (put your money on me)
You can put your money on me I'm about to go digital (put your money on me)
The speakers ain't the only thing loud, niggas smoking on medicinal (put your money on me)
Catch me going down on the cloud, black and mild, that's traditional
(put your money on me)
Got me feeling invicible
'Cuz over here I'm original
Two one six, six one four, nigga that's my shit
Five one three, four one nine, my Natty and Toldeo niggas on they grind
I'm a four four O, nine three seven and this seven four O rollin' 7-11
I'm in that 330, 330 (330)
I'm in that 330, cuz over here I'm original
Two one six, six one four, nigga that's my shit
Five one three, four one nine, my Natty and Toledo niggas on they grind
I'm original
(You can put your money on me) you can put your money me
