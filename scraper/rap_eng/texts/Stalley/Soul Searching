[Hook]
Roll the weed up nigga
Kick your feet up nigga
This is freedom nigga
No mumbo jumbo
No humble rumble
I come from the jungle
So its only right I share my struggle
Hope it helps you get your mind off that mumble shit

Roll the weed up nigga
Kick your feet up nigga
This is freedom nigga
No mumbo jumbo
No humble rumble
I come from the jungle
So its only right I share my struggle
Hope it helps you get your mind off that mumble shit

[Verse 1]
I been soul searching laying low and its been so worth it
I been a little off lately going crazy
I admit I ain't been so perfect
I ain't got no time for no fuck niggas
I been on some fuck niggas
I got a real short circuit
I been idolizing, scrutinizing in the same breath
Niggas just don't know how to worship
I been wave surfing while these other niggas can't surface
Don't compare me to (?)
We don't serve the same purpose
I be with the lions and the tigers
These monkeys in a whole 'nother circle
I'm putting on a show tell 'em hold for the curtains
Got a pastor like flow I be giving out sermons
For all the non-believers here's a little light service
I  came out the shallows let my little light surface

[Verse 2]
Stand alone on my own two
What a man that I grown to
They say patience is a virtue
I nurture all that pain that I go through
And dance in all the rain just to show moves
I break laws, bend rules
Ten toes, I be running to the check like a track meet
Not to anyone I take a back seat
I'm out front
If anyone got a problem I ain't hiding in no back street
They like how I feel about them other niggas
Shit its F them if you ask me
Matter fact its no words for them
Bird nigga facts be
I'd rather swerve, wave surf on my Max B
Big beard, wavy nigga with the gap teeth
(?) do I cut him like Apache
Them I'm out to where the cash be
