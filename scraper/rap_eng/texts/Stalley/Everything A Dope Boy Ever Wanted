[Intro: Rick Ross]
... Rolls Royces, on my 4th Ferrari
I got everything a dope boy ever wanted
I got everything a dope boy ever wanted
I got everything a dope boy ever wanted

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got everything a dope boy ever wanted
I smoke on that gas, I fly from California
Bumpin' that new Stalley, Ty Dolla I'm On It
Forbes, Cash King, real nigga persona, huh
Smokin' with my niggas, my shawty a roller
Biker gang tatted, really a Tommy Mottola
Niggas losin' touch but they tweetin' more
I only feel a rush when we eatin' more, huh
Hustle hard before my seeds deseed more
Swear to the Lord the less, why did I had with three floors?
Roll a blunt with the ladies, playmates of the month
We out the country in Dallas
It's sad son, I'm what they want
We the Money Team, Mayweather and Ricky now
No more trickin' it's time to put some real pimpin' down
We the heaviest even if it was featherweight
If it's on me, it's DeeJee K, or it's tailor made
Cribs in Atlanta, out in Vegas too
Out in Ohio it's Stalley, Manzelli kept it true
Lebron know the play, get your checks nigga
Busy gettin' mine, can't worry 'bout the next nigga
October 27th, Ohio
My nigga Stalley, it's a long way my nigga
But it feels good to know, Dreams Come True

[Verse 2: Stalley]
I got everything a dope boy ever wanted
'87 Monte, with the rallies on it
Ridin', iPhone 6 fully charged
Aux plug connected bumpin' Elvis Presley Blvd
Couple hard niggas with me playing body guard
So if you reach, get your body scarred
12 gauge shotty squad
95 percent of these niggas ain't really down to squab
The other 5 percent, playing; "God, Oh Lord"
The games comical, all I can do is laugh now
And all that beefin' gon' turn me into a cash cow
And for that money, broad daylight, I'll pull that mask down
Rozay got me out that basement, for him I'll lay that ass down
And I ain't hollerin', just smooth talk over Beat Billi
It's Double M to the grave, free Meek Milly
Dreams Worth More Than Money, The Album Bout Nothin'
BCG this our year, tell em stop frontin'
In the hood Billionaire got whatever on it
This the crown in Ohio, I sit on that throne
And welcome back Lebron, but Stalley been home

[Outro: Stalley]
Yeah, BCG, MMG
Y'all niggas act like I don't be rappin'
Like I ain't one of the nicest out here
Like I ain't got Ohio and the Midwest on my back
Y'all better pay attention
October 27th. my debut album, Ohio
Man, it's gonna be a problem
And that's all I'ma say
Rosay, what up?
You unleashed a monster my nigga, hahaha
