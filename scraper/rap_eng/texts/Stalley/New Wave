Who ready

She wanna hop on the wave
I (?) from the sidelines
She wanna live wild and dangerous
I told her that is a fine line
I can hear angels talking
I'm up in the sky line
I was down way up
I guess its about time

Who ready
Who ready
Who ready

I got the flex like Lester
Dark windows on the Tesla
Goyard belt like a wrestler
Say thanks to God he blessed us
Sitting in the trap I was restless
I had to get it together
Kill all that humble shit
I had to shit on whoeer
When the rain came
I got the whip with umbrella
When that first check came
I took it straight to the teller
Jake's Manhattan back brackin'
Stacks got my pants saggin'
G wagon on 4 G's
Whiter than the grand dragon

BCG when I rep
Jordan 1 when I step
(?) they slept
Woke 'em up from their slumber
Got 'em out their comfort
Now they all on my wave
Like really on my wave
Like get the hell out my way
Got no time for you
Wave surfing, hate serving fake person
All y'all hoes fake and got fake purses
Ain't nothing I hate worse than fake purses
And fake trappers who probably worship
