[Intro: Stalley]
Yeah yeah what up
Everybody still here with me
We rockin'
You are now rockin'
With the livest
Pick up those congos a little bit
Yeah
Let me hear that triangle a little bit more
Yeah that sounds nice
C'mon I hope y'all with me
Let's go

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Welcome to the world of sleepless
Every word is like a sweet kiss
Moon breaks through the night
The spotlight everything bright
Makes you speechless
Stardust around the body, holding on tight
Gold skyline
Every thought in my mind is so bright
Light of the lime sparkles behind
Morning dew, angellic view
Almost heaven, my car filled up
Almost every time sparks fire
Don't come close to the sky
Just bask in it
Life's in natures
Hands perfected in every
Passing minute
Limb falls out, glove admitted
At first I was a little bit timid
Now I'm in love with it
Made it my foundation, made it my stone
Now this island of mine, I made it my home
Beautify the day call on my phone
Diamond lights illuminate stones
I'm home, in my zone
What an A-life feel
I'm so real I'm surreal
I'm that deal with no deal
Jazzy flow, Coltrane feel
And I'm here to stay
What more can I say
Now listen to Brian sing

[Verse 2: Brian Auger]
Ooh
Spice island (?)
(?)
Spice island here I come
(?) in the underbrush
(?)
Surfing on silver sand
Die on the flight
Slowing through the silky palms
Feel the morning air
Life cradled in nature's arms
Never so far
Ooh
Hard winds blow
Landfall
Sailing slow
Spice island here
(?)
Spice island here I come

[Outro: Stalley]
Yah so through this autobiography
We've been through a lot of things
We seen a lot of things
You know my paradise in Madison, Ohio
You know that's where I come from
And during this project I got to travel back and
See home again
You know I seen my mom, seen my brother
I haven't been back in like five years
Last time I was back my father passed away
So this time when I got back
It was just refreshing to see my family and friends
Took some of my friends from here with me
You know got to show them around
Show them where I come from
Uh you know it was just
Amazing trip and
I hope that you appreciate everything that I give you through this album
Because its the journey that I went through
The journey that I seen
And my transition from Ohio to New York
And I'm spilling it out to you
And I hope that you just can
Feel me and understand and relate to something in it
Some kind of struggle
Some kind of pain
Some kind of joy
