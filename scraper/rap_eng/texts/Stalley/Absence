[Hook]
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music

[Verse]
You know that intelligent trunk ish that be boomin'
We need them jams so we can ride and tuck the roof in
That feel good, joy ride with a cute friend
Soft skin, brown skin, passenger seat companion
I capture the scene so well like it was shot by John (?)
Dream deliverer
You can call me the sand man
I complete the summer, give the streets something to bump to
Fly by in a 'vette so fast it'll feel like someone bumped you
System on loud, ears about to rupture

[Hook]
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music

[Bridge]
I'm back
Now let's ride

[Hook]
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music
They like Stall where you been at
You been quiet, you been gone for a minute
The summer comin' and we need that fire music
