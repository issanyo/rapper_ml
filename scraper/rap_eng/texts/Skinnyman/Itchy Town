[Intro: Skinny Man]
Itchy residents on the lurk...from the dark parks of
The dargarts it's Mongo and Skunga Brightsparks (MUD)
MUD Files...the awakening, huh
Itchy Town, Itchy Town (Itchy Town)
Itchy Town, Itchy Town, yeah
I'm on a ride wid' em (Yeah)
My peeps at my side (You know dat)
On a ride in Itchy Town, nah mean?

[Verse 1: Mongo]
I bring the raw (raw!) pure, hip-hop for sure
Not diluted, burst a brew kid and get zooted off the draw
I smoke the mostest phat cess, yes y'all
And if Baby Got Back-a-lack, I guess it's time to get sex, y'all
Do man's stuff to keep the pocket buff
But nothin' less though, catchin' wreck (Yo) from the set (Go)
Imagine it as I get on with the flow
Step aside, bro, give me room for the elbow
As the rhyme flow you better act like you know
The Mo, more than a name, I came to settle the score
You can't ignore the slaughter man
Kicking down the borders and swim through piranha infested waters(What?)
You could never find me behind the till at McD's
But try and jack these raps and I'll blind thee
I'm on a ride with my peeps by my side not behind me
Residing on the north part of Itchy (Cor blimey)

Chorus
[Skinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy's where ya findin' me

[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind me
Residing in the north side of Itchy, where ya find me

[Skinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy's where ya find me

[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residin' in the north part of Itchy where ya find me

[Verse 2: Skinny Man]
My mummy always told me I'll glow up in dancehalls like glitter balls
I'll never bite a rappers style, I eat 'em up and shit 'em all
I'll go to far places where I'm slapping 'em, jackin 'em
Names and destinations just like (Shittenham and Twattenham)
My Zone 6 child one-day Travelcard will be backin 'em
No guns in my clip but we will still be clappin 'em
It's not no A-train uptown
It is a Northern Line northbounder underground London sound
(Get gettin' down) like Roots Manuva
My distinguished broken English helps my flow deliver smoother
Whats the proof huh? I'll never quit
You said I'd fade away with British hip-hop, but you're chattin fuckin shit
Get the fuck up off my back, like a monkey on the crack
A narrow cat in Itchy Town showin' me how he slacks
Stand clear o' the doors please, mind for the gap
When in reality it's stand clear for the whores and mind the crack
Don't mind your back it's all up in my face
I look up on the shoulder and mad izm is the case

Chorus 2
[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy, where ya find me

[Skinny Man]
The ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy

[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy, where ya find me

[Skinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy

[Verse 3: Mongo]
Ready to blast to make the cash flow
Shit be tight like you sewed up your asshole
Even though you couldn't surpass Mo' you didn't even show
So how you'a gon' pass Go, bro?
For when I did begin this line you be at the startin' point
I'm waitin' at the finish line, smokin' spinach time
I'm high off phat beats
My freaky speech will now reach into your mind
Of course my voice is coarse, I gotta get my point across
(Do what, do what?) Join the dots
Blunt spots before my eyes, high rise estates
My advice: time waits for no man, so get them thousands
In your hand quick as you feel you can
For real you can (What mate?) make a million

Chorus 3
[Skinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy's where ya finding me

[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind me
Residing on the north side of Itchy, where ya find me

[SKinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy's where ya findin' me, the ride...

[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy

[Verse 4: Skinny Man]
So now somebody wan' a release with lyrics that hits without no gimmicks
My styles are like the ocean, do you think you could outswim it?
You test the Skunga P, I'll take the style out in a minute
And if you could not take me out then you should take your mic and bin it
Call me wicked (Innit) Just be merciless when I be burstin this
Freestyle off the top o' the dome with no rehearsin' this
Who be cursin' this?
Then you can tell it to my face
Happily battle anybody when the Skinny's on the case
Call me Chunky Branston, put all rappers in a pickle
Fifteen for an eighth, sellin' that much for a nickel
I'll crush your girl's blue boat and leave her 'nany crippled
Now listen to the sounds of her beef curtain dribble
(Reaaaw-raaaaw) Well now my tings have shrivelled
Pissing gonorrhoea like a rhinoceros pizzle
In the drizzle, yes I'm rappin' in the rain
Pitter-patter on my brain, help me focus on the matter all the same

Chorus 4
[Mongo]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy, where ya finding me
The ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy, where ya find me

[Skinny Man]
I'm on the ride with my peeps by my side not behind of me
Residing on the north side of Itchy's where ya finding me
The ride, my peeps, beside me not behind of me
Residing in the north side of Itchaay...

[Outro: Skinny Man]
Yeah Itchy Town, Itchy Town
Just to let you know how it's just going down
Itchy Town, they're sellin' bones and sellin' brown, what?
In Itchy Town it's like a frontline at the Underground, huh
In Itchy Taaaaaaaaooown...

(Skinny mumbles shit till fade)
