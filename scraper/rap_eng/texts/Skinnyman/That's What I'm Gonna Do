[intro]
That's discipline, most kids know that by the time they reach your age, shut it, keep it shut

[hook]
That's what I'm gonna do yeah

Man's been in and out jail, out of road then back in again
Trying to figure out how can I try begin again
I'm going all out to put my one and all in again
It's going to get even harder this time to win again
How can I begin to then get said to bust?
When I no doubt am about to get left for dust
Just come around here and you'll see that nothing's left for us
But keep your head above water blud cause it's a must
For survival is trying to get through
Are you heading in a direction of where you're trying to get to?
Don't let the pressure get you
Because the same things that distress you might depress you
I'm trying to do what the rest do
I'm trying to see my money stretching see how far it gets to

[hook]
That's what I'm gonna do yeah

I've sung my little heart out on these street corners, rappin'
Cause with no dough I've known that it's never going to happen
There can't be no shows without no financial backin'
And that's the only thing we've been lackin'
Now we're running round like madmen to get the money stackin'
To represent our art with a passion
For my take one step forward, is two steps back in
And everything around me starts crashin'
True I know that hustling ain't the only thing I can do
But I can't think of anything else to follow through
I keep searching for the answers 'til I'm left confused
What I know is that my kids are needing jacket and shoes
They need shelter and food
And I'm trying to do the best that I can do
And I'm finding it hard to follow through
Re-arrested and I'm looking to

[hook]
That's what I'm gonna do yeah

But I can't sit and screw car
You do the crime and you do the time
But don't do me like this when I'm in my prime
Weren't it my time to step up and have my shine
Trying to show certain heads what's been on my mind
Now I'm back in the grime with these long term crooks
And these dirty screws giving me dirty looks
Outside the prison gate, most of them man live shook
Cause they know that they're due to get their lives took
But me, I spend my time writing my rhymes and hooks
And trying to get my head down when I'm reading my books
Until I'm back out of road and looking frail and margo
With nothing from my youth like a fail baby father
I can't even come bearing gifts
And I wish that this year I didn't get shift
But I screw

[hook]
That's what I'm gonna do yeah

And I got plans, trust I got big dirty plans
I want to rep for the mans all across the land
And I got fans who say that they're all muddy fam
With a black, white, young, old woman or man
And I've got love for the creator and all above
And all the little thugs that are down with us
And I've got hate from little dickheads off my estate
Who really don't know how to congratulate
And I've got hope, so I keep my hopes high
And I'll stick to my guns 'til the day that I die
And it's pure truth upbring so I will not lie
And this is what I'm going to do but watch why
You won't catch a [?] so trust you must try
Stay true to the heart and hold your head high
Cause me mate

[hook]
That's what I'm gonna do yeah
That's what I'm gonna do yeah
