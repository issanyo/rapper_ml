Mind what you mix up in your meddling
You might mix up a meddling in the wrong ting
It might be the end of you
True story infused, the dark side, the dark side

[Verse 1]
I've come to know this girl when I was only thirteen
Who's got involved in my scene through the green routine
She was a princess, I surely thought she'd grow to be a queen
Behind her pretty face she wasn't all that she seemed
What do I mean?
She wouldn't let nobody intervene with all those runnings she would do to guarantee she got her green
Her appearance; always dressed smart and kept clean
So how could anyone ever know she was a drug fiend?
She came to London on her own
From a broken down home
To a town different from anything else she's ever known
But she knows people are the same though anywhere that you go
And very shortly she'd be hooked up and raking in the dough
She ran with fraud expertise doing stone and bunning cheese
She's buying properties but she be hiding up the keys
She's raking in the G's, she's living for the day she needs to get away on holiday, she's flew to L.A
She met a gangbanging kid who does drive-by's on Crips
She said 'your life's so negative so please come back to where I live'
She's fallen for this kid everything else goes on the shelf
He was her one and only love, but he loves no one but himself

[Verse 2]
He's bathing in the money he's inherited some wealth
So now he's sits there taking smack without considering his health
She worships everything about this boy but this might spoil him
Got her hot untill the point her temper started boiling
She's tried to beat his world but couldn't beat it so she joined in
When he tail off go in to the kitchen cupboard bring the foil in
It started out with quick wraps, a couple packs of kit-kats
No sooner did you know it did they began to sit and fix that
Home with with their friends sharing needles feeling free
It was the evil in the needle that led out her destiny
Says 'until death do us part, you're married now to me'
She shared the needle she conceived the deadly HIV
It took two years to pass and then this girl started to weaken
Began to show the signs that her disease started to creep in
Her eyes are always tired, she needs to have a sleep in
Her friends have stopped going around that house up on the weekend
She's booked in to the rehab, but didn't make the meeting
Her addiction's got the upper strength and she's become a weakling
She needs a fix a day just to get her on her feet then
She'll go to Soho West then sell it on a street bend
Bad tackle once she's had an overdose twice
She don't care cause she knows she's soon losing her life
Now that she's paying the price for ex-boyfriend's ways
Cause digging needles in her arm led to us digging her grave

Yeah she's paying the price for her ex-boyfriend's ways
Cause digging needles in her arm led to us digging her grave
