[Verse 1]
Is this my chance blood?
Is this my time to stand up and have my shine?
Fifteen minutes of fame for me to show all the peeps what's been on my mind
I got so much shit to say after so many years being out doing crime
I've seen the most hardcore soldiers turn into cats for being out on the line
I run away from [?]
Then, all we known was hard times
But don't get me wrong though, we've had some fun though
But that's in the back of my mind
I used hip hop as my guide
Watching my words go far and wide
Passing my time with a freestyle rhyme
As a way to make me feel bonafied
If I just think of the things we do
When I'm rolling around with a [?] crew
Fire [?] view
But now my family's keeping it true
This is the year 2002
Fuck all the snakes with the interviews
Still we're gonna end ??? news
With those ghetto views
For those ghetto [?crews]
You see

[Hook]
Love's gone from the streets
There's no love

[Verse 2]
So if my shit's gonna blow
This might just be my chance to see my life change
Fix up my aims
Fix up my games
Find the weakest links in the chain
Sick of living everyday here the same
Amongst all the cats who's all on cocaine
Pretty little girls who turn on the game
On the street where the peeps who don't use their name
Let us take a trip down memory
To see how shit is now
And who's to blame
How the answers are like there simple and plain
And the fact that I'm here means I can't complain
About cats who might wanna set you up
May call your runnings common stock
Wondering if you just run out of luck
Or was it cuz the [?] you got to fuck
Nowadays even the girls are sheiss
[?Shorts] separates the men from the mice
The cats from the pipes
The rats from the knives
They is all tryna eat from the streets at night
Me I'm just tryna be living my life
And like I said before there ain't nothing nice
Me I'm just tryna be living my life
And like I said before there ain't nothing nice

[Hook]
Love's gone from the streets
There's no love

[Verse 3]
So where's the loyalty (there's none)
From all those peeps that's been around me for years
After the blood, the sweat and the tears
Have I got any respect from my peers (no)
Everybody's shown me all their worst fears
And the boldest [?pear] them left along here
Dealing with all of the [?precious] on street
Trying not to see my death on the street
Still I'm left standing strong on my feet
With my head held high
Never seeing defeat
People who used to be strong have turned weak
Gals who used to be queens have turned freak
Is it a war we're all destined to lose
Is it through life, the things that we choose
So many man are left out confused
So who's gonna be here to guide the youths
So many people are scared by the truth
But I'm standing here to be living proof
Rapping on top of the council block roof
Cuz I'm blinging it
With my NHS gold tooth singing

[Hook]
Love's gone from the streets
There's no love
