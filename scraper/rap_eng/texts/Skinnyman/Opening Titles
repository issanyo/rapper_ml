[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
...We both came from the city of Leeds
With all those wicked as theives
We halve the apple for the man to proceed
Now we, come to blaze it all across the map
We know where we're coming from so we know where it's at
It's Braintax and Skinnyman blazing a track
Biro Funk for all the rap junkies to pack in a sack

[Verse 2: Braintx]
First of all for all the heads who don't know by now
I'm gonna start from the top and break it all right down
My moniker is Braintax when I'm spitting on wax
Or when I'm making a track but when I'm sending a fax
I sign J Christie on a licence contract cos I'm on my own label
And it's called Low Life
Putting records in the shops since '92
A lot of people don't know and think this here's brand new
I gotta shout out Destiny from Catch A Groove days
For buying in my records trekking round in a haze
Through the West End, back then me and my best friend
But now Braintax is a one-man scheme
And all my friends contribute to this solo team
I know I mean what I say plus I know what I mean
Do you know what I mean? This is Biro Funk
And it feels like a giro and a henry of skunk
See I - got the beats from Harry Love I do shows with
And me and Mystro got flows and now you know mate
I've been rapping since the Toxteth riots
So you new jack, American-wannabees need to stay quiet
I'm mad at life cos I don't really wanna be here
My Benny Live track will make you see clear
Like The Grip - Jehst beat - politics, know the dark shit
Low Life is depth, dopeness we start shit and show paths
Not in it for the laughs
And looking after business though I still hate maths
But I love cash, every 20 note's a brick
In my house in the sun that's why I'm up at half 1
I swore to stop writing punchline nonsense
And now it takes longer but I penetrate your conscience
(Who's this?) No-one else sounds like Brains, you get me?
North plus South, and my mood? Well, it's tetchy

[Hook] {repeats}
"Everybody, everybody, everbody"
"C'mon"

[Braintax]
OK, we're just starting now
Stay with the Biro Funk
I gotta give shout outs to people on the album, made it what it is
And goes like this (Braintax) that's me
Harry Love hitting on with funky beats
(Mystro!) flows to make you feel complete
Skinnyman too for analysing my shit
On the cut shorty blitzen, the shit don't stink
I'm banging for that SP shit
(Like what?) and Benny Live with the different vibe
And Jehst, one of the best - a true scribe
I ??? for the funk life
Taskforce music from the corner this year
A Shepard's Bush traffic for my atmosphere

That's how we set it off
Braintax, the finest shit
One more time fore the weed heads at the back!
La da da da dat dat
La da da da dat dat...
