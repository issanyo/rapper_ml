[Skinnyman]
I don't wanna blow up, throughout every era I've been here
So far the underground circuit has been fair
The home of hip hop, can you say you've been there?
Home's where the heart is so hip hop lives right here
I'm from UK, to you that might seem rare
I'm steppin' up now to make sure I seem clear
In every council estate we've got pure talent
No one don't care because I seen as a challenge
I suppose we'll never be the balance that you're lookin'
You wanna dilute the realness then fling a hook in
Most A&R cats I've ever met was all shooken
I'm lost for words if they don't bring a chequebook in
I'm livin' in a place where you can get your life tooken
For half steppin, by kids that'll blast weapons
Pull up at the lights they'll have you out in half seconds
Think you're rough hang around if your arse reckons
Don't have to look for trouble, trouble it'll find ya
Don't turn around it'll be right behind ya
Then September the 11th will remind ya
Nobody ain't too major nor minor
If you're brack in the streets or in a brand new recliner
Grab your dicks and girls grab your vagina
Pay the pound I'll provide the punch liner
Might look young but I'm a real old timer
Been around ever since the days of Boogie Down
You can check my resum√© the evidence can be found
Forever been blessin' eloquence over sound
Before we had the lino for spinnin' on the ground
Since then shit's changed, mad shit's gone down
But we're still gettin' down to this same old sound, that hip hop
That good shit for rockin' a crowd
Where there ain't no space for mistakes allowed
I feel proud when I'm leavin' crowds cryin' for more
This year I'm really thinkin' bout tryin' a tour
Is hip hop worth dying for, if your life's on the line and your only crime is being poor?
This time around I feel I want more
I wanna see my son's future set secure
Without havin' to go out and start breakin' the law
I'm sick of being sat in the flat shottin' the draw
I'm sick of watching every day come and go by, tellin' Titch and Fat Boy, hold your head high
See others come and go, watchin' their mothers cry, sayin', "Why did my boy have to die?"
And still we'll try
As others might choose to get high
But we must uprise through to get by
It don't take too much to figure out the facts about, who's bringing in all the coke and the crack?
This week an 82 year old got her throat slashed in the flats by some cats lookin' cash for their crack
And we're the kids whose left facing the facts
Now youths are lookin' mobiles that match their straps
Like fashion, everybody's ready for the action
Ready for the mashin' and thuggin' it with a passion
Only takes two egos to start clashin', bullets start flyin' then the blood'll start splashin'
Social rage is really climaxing
Everyday I see it getting worse by a fraction
Droughts for the weed, but nuff of that crack thing
Nobody round here is gonna be relaxin'
And this ain't no whites or a blacks thing
It's if you're livin' in the council flats and on a brap ting
They got us on a lab rat thing
And it's funny to me how easily we're all adapting
So I'm jus gonna keep-a rappin'
You lot keep ya necks snappin', and fuck the hook
Come on fuck your hook, come on "fuck the hook", say "fuck the hook"
Fuck the hook, come on fuck the hook
Fuck the hook, fuck the hook...
