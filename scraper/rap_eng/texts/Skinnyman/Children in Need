[Chorus]

Don't know why the birds aren't singing
Don't know why darkness realms

[Verse 1: Skinnyman]

I don't know why the birds ain't singing for me
But did they did they sing the same in the cage as when they're free?
Is it because they lock up, we know that's not where they're supposed to be
Like all my peoples in the bing reflecting life's reality
Or for my kids in care who feel the need for family
Growing up in a system with no sense of security
It's like a dark cloud surrounding their mentality
Overshadowing everything that they're trying to achieve
How can they have hope in believing; exposed to the ways of the streets
And everybody has their reason for deceiving
Cheating and misleading
Crushing everything that they've been dreaming
By the time they reach their teens then they have to face the demons
Trying to find the meaning of why people continue scheming
When you find the reason it's leaving your heart bleeding
Now your lost needing the feeling of being found
But until we are getting the healing darkness will surround us

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2: L.Man]

I write this song for the girl who was stuck in care
Blinded from love, emotionally shut
Sexually abused by keen workers
Who used to prey on kids like  [?]
She used to pray to God but he never answered back
Cried herself to sleep sometimes
A couple sleepless nights
When she went to school she would always draw pictures of dead people and always put her name beside the body
Snobby girls of authority used to bully her call her names push her out the dinner line at lunch break
And then she used to run back to the children's home and call her biological mother but mumsy didn't pick up the phone
In the weeks she would leave voice messages
Saying 'Mum I really miss ya
I still got your picture
Still kiss it every night before I go sleep
And I still pray to the lord like you always taught me
Just give me a call'
But things done change
She got adopted by a single mother of eight[?]
She found it hard to love beating up a younger brother for attention
Out of control her mum used to phone the jigs[?]
She couldn't take no more
Social services got involved
They took her to new foster parent in bow
She couldn't settle down
By the age of eighteen she was nicking cars
Went to Holloway prison for girls for nine months
Then she came out, she started smoking weed
Got her self a drug dealer boyfriend from Aberdeen
Selling crack and heroin to receive some love
Unprotected sex led to a baby with nothing much
Except a crackhead dad and a mum that was clinically depressed
She started smoking her own work to relieve her stress
But crack weren't enough
She found heroin was the one
She used to put her mind at rest
A pain reliever as such
I didn't know this shit was happening until last Christmas
When she came round to speak to my mum
She used to be healthy and plump
Now she looks anaemic
Blacker than ice
Skinny as fuck
I swear now
I said 'you look bad
But she couldn't look at me
Voice slurred she said 'your making me for worse, please'
I said 'I'm not leaving you alone in this state
You're my big sister'
Then a tear rolled down her skinny pale face
'Talk to me'

[Chorus 4x]
