(Out of this room, out of this place, you know; back into the world
IT'S YOUR FUCKIN WORLD MATE, NOT MINE, YOU CAN STICK IT UP UR ARSE, I DON'T WAN' IT!)

Now you've been through the worst years, jail for years
And had to come face to face with the worst of your fears
Seen blood shed, sweaty old cells you've shed tears
If you couldn't stand the bang up with the maddest of breres
Let 'em hang up, slit your wrist, nobody cares
Did you ever feel that there was duppies round you every where?
That's right blud, Are you gonna take your life blud?
Theres no better place and tonight's the nite blud
Before you tie your neck on that pipe blud
Just pass all your things out the window
And swing 'em to the right blud. Rite blud?
Fucking with this thing called life blud
I've never been the one whose ever been the rowdy type blud
From when I was a nut getting bust, I had to fight blud
And I can't see myself try'n'a give up on life blud
Not light blud, I really wanna see the light blud
I mean I wanna fix up, and make things right blud
Now I wanna fix my life blud
I mean I wanna make things right blud
And see that light blud

(Well, those are your options, and you've created 'em, you've brought it all upon yourself...
Before you kick another door down, or you kick another chef in the bollocks)
