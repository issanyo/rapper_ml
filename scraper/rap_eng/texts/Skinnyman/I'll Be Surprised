[Hook: Sly and the Family Stone]
If I make it till tomorrow
I’ll be surprised (I’ll be surprised), (I’ll be surprised)
If I make it till tomorrow
I’ll be surprised (I’ll be surprised) (I’ll be surprised)

[Verse 1: Skinnyman]
Tonight there’s gonna be a massacre
Straight after the sun goes down
Going out for all of them haters and running them down
I’m bunning them down
How you mean I’m gunning them down?
They going on as if they got the right to yam up town
Well no they won’t, we no more eating for them now
I’m bringing them beef
It’s not the meat from a cow
You wanna jack man and act like that’s gonna be allowed?
Do you think I’d let that ride?
I’m too fucking proud
The tables turn as I ride on you now
Say goodnight as I’m puttin’ your lights out
Should’ve taken me out when you had the chance
Under the moonlight
Time to meet the Devil and dance
Ask Nas, you from the Hood
You have to get yourself a gun
And when it’s on, you don’t pop your shit and run
You stand firm till the whole clip’s done
Or else you’ll have a slim chance of seeing tomorrow son

[Hook]

So now I’m roaming with 2 straps
Both off the safety catch
Around the spots where they’re shotting the crack
I’m looking for cats, to get any haters I see
How many haters up in Finsbury are there out to get me?
Just like Chong
A crack head paedophile and his son
Going on as if they heavy ’cause they holding a gun
They can’t run
How many more life’s have gotta done
So them man can sit back with a crack-pipe to bun?
Fucking scum
Love to take life for fun
Killing innocent sons and leaving heartbroken mums
I say, MURDERER, blood is on your trainer
Policeman took that to forensic doctor
MURDER the victim’s family must all hate ya
So kill me now because you won’t kill me later
I’m ready to die and I’m ready to take life
And I’m gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight

[Hook]

All night I’ve been searching
To find out where them fassy ‘oles are lurking
Think I finally found them but I still gotta be certain
I heard they shotting work in the crack house in the block
The flat, without the curtain
Come. We go hurt them?
Firebomb the letter box and leave them all burning
If they coming running, my bullets gonna splurt them
I’m all out to hurt them and leave them for dead
Making sure every one of them gets one in the head
I’m running it red
Not thinking about running from Feds
The only thoughts that I’m having is to fill them full of lead
I didn’t wanna have to go resort to all the bloodshed
But now it’s kill or be killed and left on your death bed
As I look into the face of this crack-basing demon
Knowing he’s the type who rapes his own semen
What do you believe in
The dark or the light?
I know I’m gonna be surprised if I make it through tonight
