[Intro: Made In Britain]
If you want to put me in line... well, do it. Try it. Don't fucking lie about it. Kick me in the bollocks if that's what you feel like doing, 'cause I'll do the same to you when I feel like it, so goodnight and FUCK OFF to ya!


[Chorus]
I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?

I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?


[Verse 1]
Let me try come and explain the life with live
Surrounded by the negativity tryna be positive
We hustle in the struggle
'Cause we know that something's go to give
Sometimes we don't know what to give
Still we've got a lot to give
A man of many talents
And I find I have to shot to live
'Cause we know about what being really bruck pocket is
Getting laid on more weed to make a profit with
Raggo, not caring on road just how hot it is
Kidnapped by crackheads with guns hoping they'll let ya be
Sitting in a jail house waiting for the day they'll set ya free
Situations that you wouldn't really wanna get to see
Trying hard not to let all this stress get to me
Life is not a game, and any day it could be jeopardy
When so many lickle fassyholes wanna step to me
Anywhere I go I have to bop with my weaponry
When all I wanna do is try give people the best of me
Dodging the feds because they wanna be arresting me
Just for this high grade weed that is blessing me
Lessons in life has got reality depressing me
My food for the brain is the high grade recipe!


[Chorus]
I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?

I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?


[Verse 2]
Nobody's gonna be avenging me
When I'm facing all of my enemies
I know the afterlife's a place where man wanna be sending me
So who do I depend on? ME
They say prevention is better than any cure
So fuck looking for a remedy!
Bulletproof vests ain't gonna stop man from ending me
They're aiming for my head as if I'm J. F. (Kennedy!)
Lickle fassyholes are sending me into a state of paranoia from anybody who's tryna make a friend of me
Living in this gun life 'cause mandem wanna done life
Every minute of the day been ready for a gunfight
24/7 forever fretting for my son's life
Hoping that his mum is staying clear from the scum type
Like crackhead who bun pipe
Their minds just don't run right!
So many people take the wrong path in their young life
Ready to kill man if man's gonna make a killing
And if you wanna be living, you gotta be ready and willing!


[Chorus]
I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?

I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?


[Verse 3]
I keep my game face with it
'Cause as long as you're making it
There's always gonna be somebody who wanna be taking it
My bread's only breaking with
People who I really feel in my heart
Really deserve to ever claim a stake in it
There's no mistaking it
Real recognise real in my field
And I can tell when man's faking it
My clique couldn't never roll tight with a snake in it
Give me trust, next ting man's starting misplacing it
My heart holds a place in the street
There's no escaping it
Now I stand firm on some 'Fuck you blatant' shit
Some people say that we're destined for greater shit
Trying to get to eat right now while I'm looking paper quick
So don't be coming chatting shit I'm not relating with
Nobody in this British rap game is making it
Couldn't move their mums off of the council estate with it
So, I'll be in the park shotting weed, check me later, shit...


[Chorus]
I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?

I put my life in my rhymes, now I tell ya dem
I did it all on my own, I didn't beg no friend
I done been thru it all, just to get those ends
Did I do every ting I said I would?
(Well?!) Well, then?


[Outro, Skinnyman & Made in Britain:]
And that's coming from Sounding Straight Grimey Studios where we don't give a FUCK about the final mix. It's just hip-hop for my peeps on the streets. Dealing with the radio stations that have got it loc, and the DJs that have got it loc. You know where to get my shit, if you don't, then you're not involved, blud. Yanahmean?

I don't know, Trevor. I really don't know what are we gonna do...

—About what?

About you, Tr...

—No, about you, what the FUCK are we gonna do about you?!!! If you had any balls, you'd stick a knife in the bastards who write all that bollocks, they're wankers! They're just like teachers at school, they're all fucking wankers!
