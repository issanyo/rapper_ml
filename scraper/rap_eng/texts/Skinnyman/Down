[Verse 1: Lunar C]
Everyone's mad 'cause they're underground, waiting to blow like a landmine
Blowing haze smoke, I don't pay 'em no mind
There ain't nobody I rap like
I took your girl out to dinner without enough money to pay for the bill so we split on it
She even paid for the Uber, she blew on my dick like a tuba and then did a split on it
Fucking geeks aren't good at rapping, only pushing keys when they're button bashing
On their PC, I'm not PC enough to be famous and I'm fucking glad
I won't let my TV turn me dumb
I'm promoting peace, blazing Buddha in the street like the burning monk
Bare rappers thought they was big in the game, then they fizzled out like a spliff in the rain
I don't listen to lame and pissed off 'cause they won't ever be on a level with Jake (Never)
Never thought I'd end up homeless at fifteen, I had to get my own shit
No help, everybody had separate motives
That's why I go hard as Eskimo nips
But I've gotta thank my Auntie and Uncle for putting me up for a year or two
And taking me off that estate, that gave me a clearer view of what I'm here to do
We've got the same goals, we're bound to have a problem
Must be lonely at the top 'cause it's crowded at the bottom
Lunar

[Hook: Skinnyman]
Yo, it's lonely at the top, but I can help you get down
I worked so hard to get to the top so I won't let myself down
I'm lighting it up at the top and burning it all the way down
'Cause I know that when it all comes on top, I will always be down

[Verse 2: Lunar C]
Tryna make an album that changes lives
Grew up on a council estate of mind
Scheming on how I can stay alive
Always be down but I'm staying high
That's why the fans show the love at the shows and smoke with me
Because I know I speak for them and I'm no divvy
They just like you because your flow's skippy
I should get my brain insured, they're quoting me
Spent my life tryna build a enterprise
If you ever try to jeopardise it, I won't let it slide (Lunar Fucking C)
I don't wanna battle these geeks, I'm winning, they're flopping like a amputee's sleeve
Got kicked out of school, they said I was too violent
Now I meet deadlines and you write them
I went the distance, as a kid I dreamt of getting rich
Attention deficit, my mind it just tends to drift
But I just met a chick that's single with seven kids
And lets me spend her dole money, that's friends with benefits
And I don't wanna look back angry just 'cause I never got rich quick
Everybody's just tryna make it but they don't know what it is
We've got the same roles, no need to have a problem
We're just greedy, we could all get rich together if we wasn't

[Hook: Skinnyman]
Yo, it's lonely at the top, but I can help you get down
I worked so hard to get to the top so I won't let myself down
I'm lighting it up at the top and burning it all the way down
'Cause I know that when it all comes on top, I will always be down (Always be down)
I'll always be down (Always be down)
I'll always be down (Always be down)
