Teachers who saw their education as a blessin
Come to school now all in a sort of depression
All o' da kids in the class, they all stressin
The teacher's just waitin for that first kid to test him
So school doesn't seem like its any kind of lesson
We're out on the streets tryna make our possession
The manor that we're from has turned like spaghetti western
With itchy fingers on da triggers ready for the pressin and its...

Pure depression, I'm standin at the crossroads
Thinkin bout all the other children of the lost souls
And now we only aim for goals that we can see
Another brother thought he saw his future shottin B
He's 19 an' he's caught wid a half a Kee
So now he ain't comin' home until he's 33
What a waste of a life
Jus' like a criss girl I knew who fucked man for a taste of pipe
No-one's ready to face up to these fights
But you find some mad shit on these council estates at night
So lock your shit down safe an tight
And stand firm like a soldier so you don't lose face, all right?

The police patrol the streets like beasts
Instead of chasin the thiefs they pull us up and give us beats
So we run these streets red, kids are holdin their head
As they drivin around on their stolen peds
They're just dealin the cards that life has dealt em
Half of their crews are now lockdown in Feltham
Schools an' probation just can't seem to help dem
The law has made sure that they've grown to resent dem
Don't ask them now what is their life representin
To get through their day is their sole intention
An you can't tell them that they're wrong
Coz they're all men-child and feel they know what's goin on
They haven't got no time to enjoy jus bein young or havin fun
They out there keepin it headstrong
They couldn't let Skinnyman come and advise them
They look at me as if my words was patronisin
They can't think about no long-term plans
When they just young boys tryin to be some o' da mans dem
They can't think about no long term plans
When they just young boys tryin to be some o' da mans them...
