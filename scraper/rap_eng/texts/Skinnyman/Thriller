[Verse 1, Fliptrix]
Snapping the neck of the track like a killer
Shit took a turn for the worst, that's how I got iller
What be the story, drama, slash thriller?
Man a get a verse out the hearse
Get in the whip, reverse, hit first, then third, then fifth
Swerve in the fast lane, drift
Man or a myth?
Don't know, but I do know I'm in a big cloud of the piff
Worst [?] out in the mist
Fuck the calculation, count on this
You're out to make pounds, I'm out to make hits but
Hits make pounds and make the crowd schiz
Ain't got a gift, man a grinded for this
I made my own stars, spent thousands to rise up
Late night writing, Brixton cyphering
16 years of age with a fake ID to the bouncer
Hyping
After the show, go train line writing
Couldn't give a fuck if it's raining or shining
Ever since young done 'nuff freestyling
Back in the day my boy Catford John, he had the one liners
So damn ill got Maryjaneitis
Don't really care for the Queen just care for my highness
When you say ISIS, I think about the goddess or the guys who terrorise us with the violence
All I wanna hear is silence

Hide them lips if you're talking shit 'cause son I ain't buying it
Plus, I ain't looking to get brainwashed, either
Back in the day up on the bus to a night with a fiver
See that green light? Yeah, I roll like a driver
[?] like a poltergeist [?]
Yeah, I've got my fingers in bare pies
When I rhyme I stay fly like airlines
Wide eyed, that's a white lie, cause I'm quite high
Future's bright, man look [?]
[?]

[Chorus, Fliptrix]
T H R I, Double-L, E R
Thriller
You know who we are
Killers
We're all [?] apart
Distance
The genre be a thriller
We're all movie stars
Except I ain't acting, yo
I'm a loony, yo

[Verse 2, Skinnyman]
[?]
[?]
Stepping out of my house to the rave
Knowing how I'm about to behave
Done the chat, shut the trap, run the track
And let me roll up a fat one to blaze
Once it's lit and I'm on the new wave
So damn lit to fit the new age
Can't get words to fit on my page
[?] with too much rage
Can't be chained, they can't be contained
Like, my ego's way too big for this stage
[?]
[?] and I wake, then I shake and I bake in the business
Been this way since back in the days
And it won't take more than a whack in the face
To put any little dickhead back in their place
Back to the drum roll, back to the bass
Fliptrix got Skinnyman back on the case
That's how the ting's set, so watch me set pace
Spreading love and vibes all over the place
When music hits you won't feel no pain
So here's a new banger sent straight for the face
Can you feel it?
It's that real shit
It's that funky sensation
[?] my [?] meditation
'Cause it's not only trails that I'm blazing
Bring your skills and you can get waving
Shotting that piff to keep me top baiding
Try stay on track with me, and I derail them
It's not a movie I'm making
T H R I, Double L, E R
Thriller
[?]
Soundbwoy burial, serve them for dinner
And you wanna know whose the winner?
Before Chester P started hacking the bush
Young Joe killed them all as an Angel Faced Terror
Ever since then the vision became clearer
On to my goals, I had to get nearer
Once all the smoke and the camera disappears
I'm left here with that man in the mirror

[Chorus, Fliptrix]
T H R I, Double-L, E R
Thriller
You know who we are
Killers
We're all [?] apart
Distance
The genre be a thriller
We're all movie stars
Except I ain't acting, yo
I'm a loony, yo
