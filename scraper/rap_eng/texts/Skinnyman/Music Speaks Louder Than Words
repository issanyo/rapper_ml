Music speaks louder than words
Itâ€™s the only thing the the whole world listens to

[Verse 1]
They didn't want to understand about the views of the kids
Until they heard it getting ran over the music I did
A true reflection of the place we live
Getting broadcasted live way beyond those council estate cribs
The sound of music and the power it gives
That's why I'm forever reaching out to my fans, doing my gigs
Anyone who see my show can see how true that this is
Now there's journalists wanna interview me for this
They can't be disillusioned or confused from my hits
I've just been telling it the way that it is, it's not about showbiz
Before that they wanna make my words sound twist
I think they're either dumb, ignorant or taking the piss
Before I get into this and let my words sound twist
I say excuse me while I light up my spliff
Rather twist up my 'erbs, instead of letting you lot twist up my verbs
I let my music speak out for me, louder than words

[Verse 2]
I took my raps and ran to the booth
I knew my lyrics brang you the truth
It's like nobody didn't wanna take a stand for the youth
I let them know that the system's got a plan for the youth
And how the media really couldn't handle the truth
They don't expose how the police like to handle the youth
In broad daylight they get away with strangling youth
In Camden Town on a Saturday, I brang you the proof
RIP Uncle Dob I'm still banging for you
I'm damned if I don't, same way I'm damned if I do
Now if I namesake they claim say I'm some scandalous yout
Cos the message that I brang to ya
Is the opposite to their political hypocritical propaganda
So know what you stand for or fall for anything
The jewel in the mind is worth more than any bling
That's why I'm bringing myself up in this position
To give it you it the only way the whole world listens to

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I stay loyal to the music, it won't betray me
And I'm mad over music cos it drives me crazy
I've changed for the better cos my music's changed me
I feel I've been saved like my music's saved me
Unstoppable, got my ambition in music
And I won't go abuse my position in music
I'm feeling like a man on a mission in music
The way to make the whole world listen is music
