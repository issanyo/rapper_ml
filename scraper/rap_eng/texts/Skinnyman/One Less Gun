[Delta]
It's gone too far
It's time to wipe the fake blood off that platinum plate
"When you say you're right, but you know you're wrong
Than have you the right to carry on"

[Verse 1: Delta]
On these beats how many emcees present arms
Teach kids how to commit grievous harm
Martin turned Port Arthur into Vietnam
Joe Citizen thinks he's Genghis Kahn
And a Heckler & Koch replaced my boombox
Flocks rock ox-cutters in their tube socks
I don't disrespect those forced to battle
No hippy tryna slide a white flower down a barrel
But that thug pose, where the snub nose gotta go
You suffer paranoia? Most don't wanna know
These rappers openly claim to cock back the heat
Before career criminals, they're not that discreet
That M16 with a full magazine
You can't disasemble and don't know how to clean
A rhyme about a gun ain't as dangerous
As a kid holding one feeling aimlessness, suckers

[Hook]
"When you say you're right"
One less gun
"But you know you're wrong"
What we saying is
"Than have you the right to carry on"
STOP YOUR GUN TALK --] Skinnyman
"When you say you're right"
One less gun
"But you know you're wrong"
Drop that front
"When you take the life"
The pain goes on

[Verse 2: Skinnyman]
You can't be pulling no wool over my eyes
To tell me that it's right, when it's wrong
And where acting like life goes on
Carry on, after so many lives have gone
From the blades of the swords to the bullets of the guns
And now we're recognising how far we've come
Hell on earth is manifested through the shell of a bomb
And ??? carnage running strong, now we're facing armageddon
Don't tell me that it's right when it's far from fixed up
The whole world's mixed-up, put your arms in the air
It's the arms of fear, your nations sticker
Plain to see they can't justify their acts
And they can't deny the facts
What took place through the past and karma's gonna come right back
So don't tell me nothing's wrong with that
After years of our life you've been saying that it's all alright
But it's all coming home tonight, and we'll see if you're right

[Verse 3: Delta]
Half game-hunter, half blade-runner
303 or 45, the same number
Scant to enter the club? No wonder
First blood's the Hollywood spell your son's under
Before you lick off spray, may wish to pay
Attention to which way the bullets ricochet
A loaded fire arm is a clip full of strays
To lay any innocent victim up in a grave
Inner-hate we feel now rising to the skin
Hiding in a rental home, fighting for your kin
The worth of life hangs in the balance
The true challenge is to not assume the role of a savage
Sharpen up and bury hatchets
Infra-red Crew wear the new era logo on your cap is
How pathetic another joint about a gat is
Now uranium can blow the globe off its axis

[Skinnyman]
They can't say that they're right when we know that they're wrong
From the days they've owned the very first gun
From when they took the Chinese gun powder and put it in a led pipe
And shot someone
From when they took a cannon and took 21 shots to blow off the nose
Of the sphinx
It kinda makes you think, they keep using the bombs and the guns
And we'll all be extinct
This has been a Mark B production
Brought to you by Delta, featuring myself, Skinnyman
We don't back no weapons of destruction
Not at all we don't take life
That's not part of our promotion
And we're out, peace

"When you say you're right, but you know you're wrong
Than have you the right to carry on"
