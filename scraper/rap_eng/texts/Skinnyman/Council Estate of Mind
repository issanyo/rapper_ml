[Intro]
Talkin' 'bout the science of social deprivation
From 'ere to wherever in the council estates the man are strugglin'
The poor lower working class

[Verse 1]
Blud, you go to sleep round here and have nightmares
Wake up and find the worst reality is right there
The difference is, in my dreams I'm always runnin' scared
But in reality, on road, I'm comin' prepared
So now who's gonna wanna run up and become a goner?
Everybody's gonna wanna get us, but they're on a longers
I'm still out to get the same cats from last summer
But man can't see them again, it's like they've done a runner
I'm still in the same manor, on the same number
And everybody knows where I'm at and what I'm under
I'm in the same slums, raisin' the funds
In the city where the youth man are blazin' the guns
Just look how this United Kingdom has come
Within the council estates where man'll fight over crumbs
You got young single parent mums
Havin' the hardest time tryna survive for their daughters and their sons
Be comin' out their youths, cause their youths are left out there
Raised on the ways of these streets without care
Now we're havin' our fair share of gun warfare
And it's all gone nuts and that's just cause it's poor here
People want more here, we're all on the floor here
It's raw here, can't even sleep and ignore here
Cause life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothing's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 2]
I live amongst smashed syringes
Squatters' doors hangin' off the hinges
Hookers lookin' money for Bobby, shottin' their minges
Leavin' used condoms out on the staircases
Next to the broken pipes that's left by the Base heads
Local estate heads, have grown up to hate Feds
Kids with no helmets drivin' round on some bait peds
Abandoned cars are at the bottom of the block
So when it's pissin' down, kids have got a place to plot
To cotch and blaze pot, and watch this whole spot
Full up of lost souls with no goals who get left to rot
And what, I don't expect you to ever comprehend is
Why I got all actin' so self defensive
The neighbourhood shotters have all seen what it's comin' to
Local coppers on patrol are boppin' with a gun too
So anyone could bun you, leave and desert you
How long they gonna mourn you when somebody merks you?
Tryin' not to get shift when shiftin' your work true
When you wanna shift there ain't nowhere to splurt to
The stakes are high, still the best get placed
Tryn'a find how sweet success might taste
In a place where everybody is tryin' to flex
Nobody's really gettin' anywhere, so everybody's vexed
Livin' life kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds

[Verse 3]
So these are lyrics for my people, livin' on the streets who
Know they ain't got nuttin' else to retreat to
If you gettin' food next man'll wanna eat you
Pure, bad beefs just to get to delete you
So many man nowadays are so see-through
Beware of their deceitful ways when they greet you
Those who feel it know it because they've been through
Times when their friends wanna switch up to beat you
I never used to see it but now I got a clear view
Don't let no bad minded heads try get near you
If they're not on your level they'll never hear you
Ain't no time to be shaken or fearful
If you've been through some of this evil that we do
A hundred Hail Mary's ain't enough to redeem you
All of my long time friends are crack fiends
Who have gone too far, but still say they didn't mean to
Does alleviation through base and crack relieve you?
Everybody's losin' their mind and even me too
Step into my world if you wanna catch a preview
But don't tell a soul 'cause they just won't believe you
That life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind
Life's kinda militant, stuck in the grime
Nothin's equivalent to this council estate of mind

[Hook x2]
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds
We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds
