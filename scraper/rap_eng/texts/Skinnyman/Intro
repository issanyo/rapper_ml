[Intro: Made In Britain]
				SUPERINTENDENT

		At least you can spell

		Harry Parker, your social worker - I know
		Harry very well - he says you're bright, he
		says you're worth a bit of bother

				TREVOR

		Wouldn't take the time if I were you

				SUPERINTENDENT

		Don't be clever, don't be smart, we've no
		time to waste, get that. Plenty of other
		kids we could be dealing with. If you
		really want to behave like a moron, we'll
		put you with all the other morons, under
		lock and key, at Hatchmere House, and I
		can do that. I'll have you transferred to
		a secure unit, we'll do your assessment
		from there

		If you're gonna stay here, let's make it
		clear, you're gonna have to step into
		line...

				TREVOR

		I'm not sign... !

				SUPERINTENDENT

		Just a sec! You're gonna have to step into
		line, and you're gonna have to co-operate
		Now, that shouldn't be too difficult, we're
		a reasonable lot

				TREVOR

		I'm not signing any contract!

				SUPERINTENDENT

		Well, let's look at that, shall we? Let's
		give your intelligence the benefit of the
		doubt. Mr. Parker says your a bright lad
		and I respect his opinion. So I have a
		particular interest in you - personal
		between the two of us. I want you to prove
		to me you're worth all the time and effort
		that we're prepared to put into you

		Your big break, this. 'Cause I'll not give
		you a second chance

		Alright?

				TREVOR

		Alright

				SUPERINTENDENT

		Good
