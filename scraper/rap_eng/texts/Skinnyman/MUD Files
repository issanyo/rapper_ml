[Verse 1: Chester P]
We all want freedom, but no-one wants to die
That's why half of us all sit around and get high
And we all want peace, but don't realise we must fight
That's why half of us haven't got no human rights
So I'll sacrifice my life for the cause, if I must
I'll fight for truth for the youth, they're more important than us
'cause they've still got a chance to make amends given room
While this generation's doomed, we need to save the kids
Of the apocalyptic state of today, too many drugs are consumed
And the air's pumped with toxic fumes, persistently
The old folk are slightly confused, the middle-aged are abused
It's up to us to save the yout's
But we're too busy fightin' over women, drugs and debts
We don't fight for our rights, we just fight amongst ourselves
Over egotistic stupidness, with a touch of ghetto ruthlessness
But we're all angry together
So fightin' each other's like fightin' our reflections in a mirror
We'll only hurt ourselves and no-one else
It's a lab rat situation in this man-made hell
And we're all rats livin' in this laboratory cell
Growin' contaminated rapidly faster
So let's join all our angers and hunt the ratmaster
As a force on its own, one single clique
Assemble in the streets when you hear the pips...

[Verse 2: Mongo]
You can mix me with your blood, stir me with sugar and milk
You can try to break me down just by calling me shit
You can find me in jail, but on the streets is where I live
But same ways my name's spoke can make some wanna call the filth
I can be bought and sold in every shop, my sales increase outside them
In demand by the public, somebody must provide them
Fly me across the border, the price on my head triples
Boostin' country's economies, wronging me could leave them crippled
In supply and demand, in control in every land
I've been used and abused from teachers to doctors and
I've been known to kill the daughters of a judge and policeman
If anyone can catch a man, believe that I can
And I'm always gettin' stronger, divide and conquer is my plan
I've done my fair share of evil, I've always done good
Nobody can control me, but they'd love that if they could
I'm the reason for demisin' livin' standards round your neighbourhood
It's me what make crime rise like tides of great floods
I'll take ya a couple places, that's if you'll allow me
I'm the reason of wonder, that's why mystery shrouds me
My lows are like the gutter, highs are way up where the clouds be
I'm in amongst the heads, whether somebodies or nobodies
Dealin' with me has always been known to be dodgy
I'll make your feet muddy, I'll show you that I'm godly
I'm the drug...

[Verse 3: Skinny Man]
So how we ever gonna function if these ghetto youths
Don't know we have to first put down our weapons of destruction
Guns and Cracks and all that shit is part of their corruption
It's hot to the boiling point so you can all expect eruptions
Extremes in good and bad don't add, what is the solution?
'cause people are still singin' out their own Songs of Redemption
Pollution in the mind is something that I'd like to mention
Revolutionary youths upon the street they feel the tension
You're in a spell of sleep so you'll always be a victim
Of the brainwash that is run on you in Babylon's system
There's conspiracies that's run by all these hierarchy Masons
Don't fall into their trap by glamourisin' Crack-basin'
What we're facin' on the streets is the drugs gettin' supplied
We don't get to see the key is knowledge, that has been denied
I could start pointin' my fingers at religions that have lied
There won't be no place to run and there won't be no place to hide
Find the answers to the mystics and you too can oversee
Physically we're trapped, but spiritually we can all be free
My adrenalin was stuck within' the MUD with Chester P
Energisin' energy creatin' electricity
Skunga Brightsparks, Skinny Man aka Skunga P
Big respects to the MUD and shouts out to the B
