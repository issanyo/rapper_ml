Hooooldin tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade
Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more

Step in the booth get bars on the page out lining up high grade on the table
Who woulda thought that this guy'd end up fucked up tryna get paid through paypal
Gigs on the regs with culprate blaze out, hyping a set see I'm outta my cage now
Act real nice off stage then when I'm on the mic i'll unleash hype in the rave like blaow
Ye i run that, i'll do shout outs at the end so bun that
I'm gonna get real deep on the mic so hold on tight inside while i run this vibe right by you
Find that darkest part of the room and sit, on ur backside
Don't get up till the end of the track, I mean don't move or you might get smacked I
Need to calm, and get the words out that thinking about
Oh dear I know what this songs bout here pass me the grade and split that snout then
Bill another zoot and make it tasty, gotta make zoots bare fat when i blaze these
Then my mind starts turning deep head rush to the brain I'm weak in the knees
I'm startin to feel bare rough when i speak i'm holding onto this zoot
But i know i can't hold on much longer, half of my potential squandered
When i sit bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -

Soooo - I'm holding tight onto my chro
Cos i can't take life without the high grade no more

I ain't got nothin to prove if i get roughed up I'm bussing a move
I'm lean as fuck and I still might light these up before the nights through
See, theres no controlling me, its my choice if i get dope n lean
But i ain't gonna drag no one down with me, if its the end, then I'm gonna move swiftly
Quick see when i drift i get lost in abyss in the mist of a black hole
Tryna find my way back to the clean intact soul that i used to inhabit
But now its so, packed fulla dope when i toke its green thats causin damage
The truth is i should have really tried to quite time ago
But i couldn't quit so i gave rhymes a go, and now i'm
So reliant on the grade that i puff 10 zoots in a day and it don't even phase me
Apart from the fact that i surrender to munchies and get real lazy
So maybe its time that i gave it a break and changed up the mind state
Forget the dark vibes 'lifes alright mate', cos if i keep thinking like this
Then i ainâ€™t gonna live for a whole lot longer, a diet thats consists of zoots and bongs
Well & truly means that my potentials squandered, when i sit
Bunnin up zoots, loving up tunes, billin up hoots, killin up booths
My mind resorts to turning ill, the end is near but for now I'm still just -
