[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a nigga in the eye, you could tell if he timid
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love, only love is your money
So when it's over nigga, are you a thug or a dummy, I'm neither
But I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
And fuck rap I make mils of reefer, I'm a man first
Tired of punching niggas, so I'mma shoot niggas cuz my hands hurt
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!

[Hook - Styles P (Jadakiss)]
Fuck that, pop off till nothing in the clip left (pop off)
Till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
Hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
If they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left)
Stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure ain't a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
This is LOXville
And even White America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a Jackass like Johnny Knoxville
So I can just imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
And you ain't worth my shells
So you should just imagine how the ox feel
A lotta niggas is thousandaires
Walking round town, fronting like they got mils
For what it's worth, I'm one myself
But my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
But you still might catch Kiss in some Hot Wheels
New Bentley coupe, with the stock wheels (Haha)
Look how I get back to it, I send my young niggas to do it, in the black Buick
I don't spit bars, or distribute the crack fluid
All I'm really waiting on is for niggas to act stupid

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
To all my real niggas, sorry for keeping you waitin', (sorry)
It's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan
I love y'all tho, my niggas for even relatin', (i love y'all)
This ain't Kiss talking neither, I'm speakin for Jason, (mwah)
When you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin
Niggas jaws is like laws though, easy to break em
If I wasn't on some shit, I'm gettin on it
Come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened
Might as well declare the clappin
Cuz my bones is old, gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin
Hate a nigga that, ain't never there to see shit, but always hear what happened
The thing better than money, is respect
No love this time, nigga, Kiss Of Death, what!

[Hook]
