Intro (Saigon)
Damn girl
It ain't true what they sayin is it?
Yeah look like
The tables dun' turned
I mean by the looks of things
It might be safe to say
The women are the new dogs, Jovan

Chorus (Jovan Dais)
She's mine even though she's yours
You ain't' the only one breaking her off
It don't seem right but that's how we made em
Women are the new players
Don't' hate em
And she be lyin when she say where she goin
Tell me be quiet when he call on the phone
I had to question why girl you do him so wrong
She said I got it from yall
Women are the new dogs

Verse 1 (Saigon)
I'm nice like Lauryn on the freestyle
He done found my number one his wife's speed dial
Ooh she finna get a beat down
He come here yeah we'll be warren like the g child
Nigga your chick chose M.Y
I step up in the night spot I ain't' even inquire
On who she was, who she wit, who she love, who she hit
Truefuly nigga I thought your chick was on some bougie shit
Till I seen her sipping Henessy dark women who drink that man
Them women be hard
When I say hard I ain't' talkin bout like Rihanna
Talking first night bitch'll let you hit the vagina
I'm buyin time like we expectin debt
All up in your chickens neck
She a smut but I still give her respect
Cause she said she's a she ain't' nothing but a new dog
So I put on more than just two paws

Chorus

Verse 2 (Saigon)
And I'm thinking I'm doing her dirty
Thinking she good thinking she not hurt worthy
And no not for a sec did I expect she was still give me sex to her ex
Till I checked a radio station doin a segment called true confession
A caller called in said he had proof without a question
But he was hitting my chick, doin it to her naked
And he said I hope this nigga's using protection
They all laugh up down on the west side ave
Other listeners point at me from they whips like ha ha
Feelign like a jackass thinkin she got the nerve
But something deep inside knew I'm gettin what I deserved
I had Tammy on Tuesday
Theresa on Thurs
While I was getting mine
I guess she was getting hers
And then right after the dude called they played a song called women are the new dogs

Chorus

Verse 3 (Saigon)
They saying women are the new dogs
Cause a lot of men turnin into RuPaul
If that's your thing, by any means do y'all
Me I'd rather die from a terminal case of blue balls
Back to women being the new dogs
I think 90% of this is the dudes fault
But when you grew up listening to that Too Short
You end up thinking the same way as Snoop Dogg
You think them bitches ain't' shit but hoes and tricks
We ain't treat em like queens like they supposed to get
And instead of loving em better like uncle L woulda said
We said to hell with em and that fucked up they heads
That's bad

Chorus
