Nothing
But a melody
I'm usually in the zone, bitch don't bother me
Seeing science fiction, as reality
Diving in the ocean toking j's on the balcony
Bahia Mar rooftop see the whole city
Can't see you got sun poisoning
I body bars alki's follow me
John Cene can't see we, breeze like palm trees
Me no worries
Just a melody bitch don't bother me
Class in session
Head up in the clouds, chillin with the Jetsons
Head so big get mistaken as Precious
Light complexion
Redder than Texas
Redder than Dexter when he cleaning up messes I'm blessin
To in press Rock City Drummond on my chest

Pen page melody
Rap game Holy Trinity
Live in my sleep so I write what I dream
Geez beats diseased please
Class more iller
I'm like a white gorilla
Pillage a village with a goose down pillow
Making a living by making em listen
Willing, wishing, gotta be kidding
Tripping, living when the wheel keeps spinning
And the world keeps skimming
Clinging to the meaning of the word livid
Now I'm here to teach ya
Class in session I am the teacher dream
