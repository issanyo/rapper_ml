[Intro: Pamela Long]
Playa, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Take me place where I ain't gotta be sexy
Just so I can be considered a lady
Please tell me why the world is so shady, baby
I wanna go to a world where I ain't gotta be a freak ho
Just so I can be noticed by people
Please tell me if you know
Because I wanna go, wanna go, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Trina]
Why is it lately?
These jealous hoes gotta hate me
Niggas won't give me no space
They suffocate me
I try to be myself niggas won't let me
They'd rather sweat me
Ice, freeze, and briget me
But I ain't impressed with your hot car
Nigga I ain't got the lock jaws
I ain't fixin' to drop draw's
These niggas chase me like a cop-cop
In and out the Char' bottle
They wanna ball with a hot star
They offer me grands for one night stands
Fuck that one night plan
I'm looking for that one right man
To save the day, wrap me in his arms
Take me away, late plight till the break in the day
Come on

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Take me place where I ain't gotta be sexy
Just so I can be considered a lady
Please tell me why the world is so shady, baby
I wanna go to a world where I ain't gotta be a freak ho
Just so I can be noticed by people
Please tell me if you know
Because I wanna go, wanna go, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Trina]
Take me to a place where all my girls on top
Take me to a place where all the Benzes drop top
Take me to a place where I ain't gotta trick for grands
Take me to a place where my friend won't fuck my man
Take me to a place where it's women with no hoes
Take me to a place where the thugs get early parole
Take me to a place where we ball, buying cases
Diamond faces, united with all races
Take me to a place where ain't no chalk traces or court cases
Or black faces on front pages
Take me to a place where the haters don't hate
Take me away, Lord knows I can't wait, come on

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Take me place where I ain't gotta be sexy
Just so I can be considered a lady
Please tell me why the world is so shady, baby
I wanna go to a world where I ain't gotta be a freak ho
Just so I can be noticed by people
Please tell me if you know
Because I wanna go, wanna go, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Trina]
Every day I gotta let it go
And spend the money on the one way ticket
To a world where shit is better yo
I be the same but a better ho
And do a version of Nann with Kirk Franklin for the chedda yo
They'll show my video on VH1, diva week
Me, Whitney, then Aretha speak
I be on top of the world and still be a freak
Although I'm doing my thing
I see I gotta eat cause where I'm from
Life ain't sweet

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Take me place where I ain't gotta be sexy
Just so I can be considered a lady
Please tell me why the world is so shady, baby
I wanna go to a world where I ain't gotta be a freak ho
Just so I can be noticed by people
Please tell me if you know
Because I wanna go, wanna go, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Pamela Long]
Take me, take me baby
Where I wanna go baby
I don't wanna be a freak ho
No more, more
Take me, take me baby
Where I wanna go baby
I don't wanna be a freak ho
No more, more

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Take me place where I ain't gotta be sexy
Just so I can be considered a lady
Please tell me why the world is so shady, baby
I wanna go to a world where I ain't gotta be a freak ho
Just so I can be noticed by people
Please tell me if you know
Because I wanna go, wanna go, yeah, yeah
