[Verse 1: Shaquille O'Neal]
You can't stop it, block it, when I drop it
Anytime I go rhyme for rhyme on a topic
You ain't even fit to step in Shaq's arena
I look inside your mind and I see your shook demeanor
In your eyes, why are you surprised?
No matter how you try, I'm fly as Elliuqahs
The new edition, this is the end of your last night
In the day time, you couldn't see me with a flashlight
I crash flights on sights of my enemy
I'm coming through, and then I bomb your whole vicinity
Why they acting faking jacks? You're not a friend of me
I peeped your card, you're not as hard as you pretend to be
Who wanna spark it with the chocolate?
Macadamia, head clean to the cranium
You know the name, Shaq aim to maintain
Money on the brain, can't stop the reign (the reign)

[Chorus]
You can't stop the reign (You can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
You can't lock that door (Unlock the door)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I speak deep with killers, about million-dollar figures
Blessing niggas in Ac Legends and Vigors
Cream lizards, cream Coogi's, I do my duty
As long as they fly as me, and high as me
Success of my circle, try to break it, I'll hurt you
Ain't no gettin' out that, I doubt that (I doubt that)
We want the exotic, erotic ladies
Not them toxic ladies that burn a lot
I learned a lot, from junkies to ruffians
From being tied up by Colombians, 'cause eighty grams was missing
Listen, had to change my position
From wanting to be large to head nigga in charge
My garage, call it Cee-lo, four, fives and sixes
Honies by the mixes, if it ain't broke don't fix it
Smoke out with Leo, Biggie Tarantino
Size like a sumo, Frank White, numero uno

[Chorus]
You can't stop the reign (you can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (when it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door (unlock the door)

[Verse 3: Shaquille O'Neal (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Seven-O, ha, towering inferno
Invincible smooth individual
Who wanna test it, foreign or domestic
No matter where you're from, I'm not the one you wanna mess with
Origin-al willie style, living lavish
Private jets to let my shorty shop in Paris (uhh, uhh, what)
I'm not the average, I'm far from the norm (uhh)
It's Daddy Long, hitting 'em strong, keeping you warm

[Verse 4: The Notorious B.I.G.]
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G's minimum to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nine's and MACs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push 6 coupes that's yellow
Bust clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you're in
Crack bragging, sick of bragging how my mink be dragging
Desert E's street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the Devil
What

[Chorus]
You can't stop the reign (you can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (when it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door (unlock the door)

You can't stop the reign (you can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (when it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door (unlock the door)

You can't stop the reign (you can't stop the reign, no)
When it starts to fall (when it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door
