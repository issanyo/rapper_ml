Verse 1:  Lord Tariq
Yo, low profile, I creeps like the phantom
Introduce you to the steps in my duplex
In the Hamptons where hit it harder is the anthem
With thoughts of crackin yo legs like plexiglass
I put my face between yo thighs with yo sexy ass
Have you grinnin with yo head spinnin
Like my B-B-S's, and I'm plannin to run in em if they carry big breastes
Wit more wood than the '98 Lexus G-S's
And I'm good at takin you shoppin and then poppin the question

Verse 2:  Peter Gunz
In the summer I like havin sex in the park
In the winter I love havin sex in my car
In the backseat of a taxi, put yo skirt on no panties
And I'll lick it like it's taffy
If you ask me, Peter slides tongue through yo bushes
While you wishes
He was yours but he's not he's here for the night
Get it right
You call it anytime any place
Do you like it from the back, I like it in my face, tell me
