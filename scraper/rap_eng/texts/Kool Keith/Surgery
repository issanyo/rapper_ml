[Dr. Dooom]
Dr. Dooom
Yeah
Okay

You wanna face up, move out, get position
Trunk jewelry is heavy competition
Your girl move with them thongs in the kitchen
When I talk to the hawk, fly to the mission
The president move, everybody listen
To Scott LaRock, Red Bull like Pippen
The verse stopper with words turnin over flipping
You in the wheelchair, bopping like Sam crippling
You fat from pork, your girl's [?]
Proclaim the fiddle, pom-poms in the middle
Superstars respect the kids with peanut brittle
Boy scout with doubt, play like Roger Trout
[?] your girl's formin' a mob
I'm Baskin Rob, I'm baskin' Bob
Across from the lizard walking right behind the frog
I'm out in Europe, with the blondes hanging right on the side
The porn stars be out in Prague

[Chorus] (Kool Keith, Motion Man)

You can pay for surgery to look like me
Top dollar face cuts your [?], stomach talk
You can look, act like, can't hold our jocks up
You can pay for surgery to look like me
Top dollar face cuts your [?], stomach talk
You can look, act like, but never will measure up
