[Intro]
Yeah
Simon
I'm talkin' to you
This motherfucker right here's for you
You got a lot of motherfuckers comin' up on your show
And you tryna act like you motherfuckin' judgin' every-fuckin'-body
You ain't no-motherfuckin'-body

[Verse]
Fuck American Idol, Simon, and his whack ass!
He can kiss the bottom of my foot and Paula can kiss my black ass
That show is for no pro, it's for a jackass
I piss on the ratings with a scuba diving tank with a German mask
The type of guy to defecate on jazz and bluegrass
Paint your face black, I guarantee all your assets, you'll leave with a blue ass
I'm that insurance guy that come with a tow truck, when your Maybach crash
These microphone niggas with big budgets is trash
Lassie-type niggas who don't bark back, they sneak-bite niggas
I'm ready for combat with poison down on the floor
You come up and test my shit like a rat
You pick a spot where you think you fuckin hot
And watch me wipe my ass wit'cha baseball cap
I piss on your pants from the Gap
Your bitch be fucked up with Noxzema on her face with a headwrap
That shit your spit to everybody is head-crap
Fuck with Franklin Fred rap
You're just a man sneakin' back through a crack in rap
Flip your fuckin toupee like a flapjack
You a sap in rap, that bitch ain't got no fat ass in the magazines
That's mad-flat, she's just hyped up with a corny basketball-ass
That's mad-fat, in fact, she's a DVD homeless cat
Somebody I wouldn't want to dance to my track
Or put on some pants to my track
How you gon' stand there? You better be in a b-boy stance to my track
Everybody flippin' over a bullshit thong in your buttcrack
Now I'm hyper-toned up with a Corona
She ain't got gas in her ass to get from Corona
She's a roommate livin' on a budget from a loaner
A grown-ass woman flyin' back and forth to a yellow Toyota
Fuckin' with some cornbread ten-karat-gold-chain nigga that look like Yoda
How the fuck you gon' represent plastic surgery?
Yo' ass movin in with the club promoter
How long you gon' do that shit 'til you get older and bolder?
With strength from the butt needles
I'm that nigga that's low-key in the spotlight
Watchin' your peoples, on some real-life
I'm surreal trife, watchin' these girls out in Vegas
Askin' Carmelo Anthony to turn on they Con Edison lights

[Outro]
Yeah! We rule
Dr. Dooom is in the fuckin' room
Now you take that motherfucker personal
I want y'all to cover your ass
I'mma be there! Motherfucker, I'mma be there
Right in the back of your fuckin' dandruff, right on top of your hair
Yeah!
