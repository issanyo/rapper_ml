Spectrum City, coming down
Who's that coming down out the galaxy, follow me (follow me)
I'm Apollo Creed, first ship to board (first ship to board)
Spectrum City, coming down
Who's that coming down out the galaxy, follow me
I'm Apollo Creed, first ship to board

[Verse 1]
I'm a particle matter, data splatter, fatter, badder data
Reach up 'til I'm over the top, the competition sinking in the swamp
Everybody trying to go above the basket to reverse
Get they shot blocked like a vodka
You experienced the space conscious
The flight sky shuttle
Leave them dudes trying to obey the lieutenant on the double
The people stand back in their lyrical huddles

[Hook]
Spectrum City, I'm coming down
Coming down out the galaxy, follow me (follow me)
I'm Apollo Creed, first ship to board (first ship)
Press record
Apollo Creed, first ship to board (first ship)
I'm coming down out the city
Who's that coming out the galaxy, follow me
I'm Apollo Creed

[Verse 2]
My destiny got y'all [?]
Taking care of new talent
View the world so paramic
Don't take a Xanax to relax with the sandwich
The hitch
Ride on the back of the cadence
Enter your name and identification if you the greatest
You can reach for your goals
'Cause you failed to sign your rapping approval into papers
A-S-S-R-V-T-C-U-X-Y
I'm auto-5
Laser ray specialist

[Altered Hook]
Spectrum City, coming down
Who's coming down out the galaxy, follow me
I'm Apollo Creed, first ship to board

[Verse 3]
Calculation is approximate, I'm fetching the documents
No team can stop me on offense, most rappers don't have the confidence
To launch and get off the ground a couple inches
More than a dark knight of the flight
Looking over the sky like Batman, my only comp' was Spider-man
The Avengers coming after me in an SUV van
Beach weather, I got an SUV tan
The cosmic intergalactic button I press on my hand
Spaced out 'til the night is gone
Drinking Patr√≥n, I changed my name to Patron
All rappers become cheerleaders with neon pom-poms
My radiation melt down R & B songs
Singers turn to liquid, MC's turn to cosmic biscuits
Pillsbury

[Altered Hook]
