[Intro]
Don't be shy-y
Don't you be shy
Don't be shy-y
Don't you be shy
Don't be shy-y
Don't be shy-y
Don't be shy-y...

Words to the editor, I would love to check in to say [?] in Vegas with Adrian Moore
Upscale talent with the jacuzzi, built in the middle of the sweet floor
As a classy way to convince
Her high heels, her uppin’ to use the tone of my voice for sexual intercourse
Rub her back so good, she want me to be her boss
Once the strobe lights start working she sees the panties in slow-motion start to come off
I’m sliding real cool without using force
A touch above Christina with my hands between her
She had the taste of the natural smoothie
In the 944 beige Porsche
[?] her sister’s my best friend
She give me females’ numbers I request
Who wanna be wined and dined by the man of Forbes
It depends on what the pads absorb
I know for sure a lot of reality housewives are bored
I drive around with no draws
Notify the company where she work at
Tell her to answer the phone if she home
With a slow grip and pet one of her cats
She need lingerie on share
So I can see how the cheeks look from the back
Get the keys to her BMW, drive to get condoms at Walgreens at CBS
While she takin’ a bath
The buns, I wanna put butter on them like baked bread
Whatever she got, my smooth hand can pull ‘em in half
After you close your laptop you need to stop
Virtual reality and stop thinkin’ in the past
I can give you a option, baby adoption
Or you could wear a g-string and a mask

Uplift yourself to levels you’ve never been
Ocean view room and a pelican [?]
While I’m rubbin’ you down
Sippin’ a black bottle and look like dawn
It’s the beverage
This evening celebration, I’m lookin’ for your motivation

[Outro]
Don't be shy-y
Don't you be shy
Don't be shy-y
Don't you be shy
Don't be shy-y
Don't be shy-y
Don't be shy-y
