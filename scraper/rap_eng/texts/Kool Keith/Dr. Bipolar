[Chorus:]
Dr. Bipolar [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Fantasy lyrics bipolar expression
Dr. Bipolar riding around with them mirrors reflecting
The same serum injecting respecting the wolf man
[???] bark of the night dog in tight white drawers
In the house watching Mr Slate coming by
Making house calls am I right or am I wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Another skip off the beat it’s like
Sneakers walking down on the dark road on the beat
Harry Potter lamp with heat
The sorcerer with monkeys playing drums out the keep
Tales of the crypt another Doctor Cruiseship
Bringing in paramedics and stretchers with hits
Someone in stitches

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
This time I’m watching myself impersonating
Another person without rehearsing
The owl says Who? to the verses
With the tracks stacked up Count Dracula step up
With cocoa puffs
Make up Dr. Bipolar get popular

[Chorus]
