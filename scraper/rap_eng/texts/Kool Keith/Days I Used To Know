[Verse:]
His rocket ship in heading
In the general direction of Earth isn't it
Sure
Have yourself looking at the view
And turn the radio scope on
All by looking one way forward window
No socket am talkin by me
Have I ever led you to the work of navigation
Now i want you to land me near the ruins
Of an ancient city in Philadelphia
Move out of that control seat
No Sir
I'm taking this ship back to the silver space bowl
