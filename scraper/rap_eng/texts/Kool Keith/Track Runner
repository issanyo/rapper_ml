Hey, hey, hey
Shine, I'm 'bout to get on

It's easy to write a verse for the condition
Hold you cats in front of the bowl
I stutter step with the local act
Who's doin all the pissin on the top?

Head with the nitroglyc'
With robotic mechanical, with the nitro fist
Superhero, Dr. Zero, countin Robert Deniros
American cash and euro, I'm strictly biz-o
Choppin it up at Quizno's

Whatever, for sure, verses spread around like kids, no?
If they really wanna come
I get which Bo, quarterbackin' they team
That can't throw when I land in Sweden

Get off with the pass where the heat throw
And let the heat go
Chuck Green, it's all about the meat though
And how I speak so

Ask the chocolate factory I closed down
Full cups with cocoa
I'm comin' so dope like Muhammad in rope-a-dope
Emcees, get the product son they smoke the coke
Some grab the mic and choke, many go home and hope

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends

Get drunk, get smoked up
(Uh, huh)
Get fucked up, get high get crunk
(Let's go)

Take clothes off, club goes off
(Uhh)
Against security, shots go off
Stumblin', to the back of the jump off

Celebrity acts and sexual tactics
You see the fact is, we do this e'ry night
Sleep until noon, wait until a full moon
Jack Daniels, Johnnie Walker on the floor
Open bottles, America's Top Model

Tyra won't bother, 'cause last week in Vegas
I got her sittin' on a coke bottle
The model, drink everything you can swallow
Smoke kush skunk, chase it down, gin and tonic
Magnums, lifestyles, we do it, 'Wildstyle'
Bodies hit the floor, drowning Pool, bar four

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends

What you think if I went gat blastin'?
Killin' clown ass emcees who come with the trash shit
They don't understand how to make classics
I've mastered, the flow, it's fuckin' timeless

Yeah, styles beyond, you can't fuck with this
I might bar hang emcee, to a side shit
I rip your brain, one eye hangin'
Your nose busted, your lip still danglin'

Walk into the Palladium, arena or stadium
Been playin' 'em, while your girl wanna be my friend
I intend, to offend, right or wrong, I'ma win
Then begin to kill niggas just like a villain

Yeah, the crowd is hyped, they heads up close to the speaker
This bitch that stuff her blouse now took off her sneakers
They gettin' naked, I jumped off the stage for a second
Nah God, chill God, not yet

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends

Move, shake somethin', pop somethin'
Do your thing, girl, break somethin', it ain't nothin'
'Cause after the show the hotel next city do it again
Next time bring two of your friends
