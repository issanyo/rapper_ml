[Intro: Santa]
Ooh-wee
Kool Keith, is that you darling?
They call me Santa

[Hook: Santa]
Ah, ah, ah, I can make this work
I can make this work
I can make this work

[Verse 1: Santa]
Come on, I bloody shit up, you can call me Kotex
And I cut checks, nigga, fuck who got next
You can wear a body vest, we gunning for your head
Straight business, kid, no witness, kid, I'll leave your mother dead
I roll with the killers, the monsters, the [?]
Santa runs the charts, the streets, it's just [?] come on
I ain't a Barbie, I'm a porcelain chick
Shout out to Young Neck, mami, get them chips
You see, my mission is to take over the world
Fuck the diamonds and the pearls, and the beefing with the girls
Come on, raising the bar while I'm taking a bar
And them corporate cats mad I got my tips in their jar
You see I could have been a sucker, signed for half a mil'
But y'all can suck a dick and keep your 360 deals
'Cause, I'm the bitch that the streets really feel
And everybody knows real recognize real
I got the hoop flooded like roaches
Watch how I approach this
So gutter, you would think that I was loc'n
Silly rabbit, it's a habit to grab it
Make your rap career disappear quicker than magic
I'm like, fuck you, pay me, I'm such a fucking lady
Brooklyn, bitch, it's there, we so crazy
Coming full force, better call the MD's
Call the doctors, call the medics, just don't call the D's
'Cause fuck the, fuck the, fuck-fuck the police
I'm a real gangster bitch, we handle beef in the streets
And please excuse my potty mouth, shit, I'm on my period
I'm here to take this mother, mother, mother over, period

[Hook: Santa]

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
I'm Malcolm X side with twin drinking that Hypnotiq
In Hollywood, give you the face with College and 14th street with the heat
I'll put you under the cosmopolitan suite back, push the heat back
You need snacks, ice packs on the knees
Get in the street, dunk like Dominique on [?] with Top Ramen week
You got a colonic up the cheek because I'm Musiq Soulchild
My void be full of new now, cattle, I raise new cows
Come out the shower, pop your ass with two towels
Snap your gum with your toes snappy, that's the swaggy
Analytical tip biter, rhyme all-nighter
Your legs look tighter and tighter
Arthritis MacGuyver make your man shit out a screwdriver
Cook cayenne pep', Chinese food, drinking Schweppes
Goggles on the X-Man, my shirt show the glow in the dark X
Xavier McDan, I had wool before Woolworth
How the fuck you gonna wear a $9,000 suit with Thom McAnn
