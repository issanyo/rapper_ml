[Intro]

[Verse 1: Dr Octagon]
Penicillin villain and reactivate forcing
Fly around with utensils reporting
No dimension while recording
Doctor bounce the basketballs and the heights
While they're wearing Jordans
Your girl drooling with sweat pouring
Sonic music laser rear around your ears with the chorus
The beef patty from  golden crust kick like Chuck Norris
Another white horse in the black yard without the harness
Chariots carry me like Washington, George write the prescription
This ain't demented, people say I'm using antibiotics
With no sentences, Automator in the galaxy, gladiator infinite
Washing my sneakers off with Pepsodent new world experiments

[Hook: Dr Octagon]
Doctor headed to the hospital, i'm in orbit

October is the month of the gynaecologist manhunt
Celery and carrots with nurses piercing they breasts
With double bed bunks
The opium funnel watch them get close to each other and cuddle
Cadillac big enough to drive through a butthole
Honor me on the wall, pen and scroll
Reanimate, hold your head in your hand while I bake oatmeal Cookies in that stove, snoop a pepper on your dog with oregano
This is fumigated gas coming out the mixing bowl, so original
Let's go inside with the way my legal pad paper fall

[Hook: Dr Octagon]
Doctor headed to the hospital, I'm in orbit

[Verse 3: Dr Octagon]
Radical vibes keep us alive
Those who play Charles blind need to be
Receiving the music like a critic with a crooked hairline
The pad is the bullets, the pen did the crime
Wearing my insulated condoms going overtime
I sketch out and draw
Ladies with china ways walking with their pants off
Would you be mad if Octagon vision saw them in dancehall
I plans with the ski hat and my scarf
Me and Dab bust a U-Y with the bass guitar
In the double R, Egor looking inside bazaar
Show for ho the parrot on his shoulder
The bird peck til he sober

[Hook: Dr Octagon]
Doctor headed to the hospital, i'm in orbit
