[Verse 1:]
Yo I was buying a drink last night
I saw you across the room
That was you at the bar right?
Sippin on champagne
Or was that chardonnay

[Chorus:][x2]
You got downtown
Where we go party
You going outside
You blowing your mind
Running round
We got downtown

[Verse 2:]
Girl you notice all the time
You have
You get mad when I look at you girl’s ass
She’s standing in front of me
Just on purpose
She got her black spandex on
And it’s showing the camel toe
She got boots on
Bitch think she really cames
Motherfucker it’s crazyy
Yeah

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge:]
Ohh yeah
Baby you got damn time
You blowing your mind
You blowing you own goddam mind
G-strings alll I see is thongs
Ohh
Girl[x2]
You say you fly
Got mascara over your eyes
And under the weave is an afro
So long, long long long long
Baby

[Chorus][x2]

[Incoherent singing in background]

[Record scratch sample]
You got downtown[x4]

[Chorus]

[Record scratch sample]
