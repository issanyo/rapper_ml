[Chorus:]
Rain on a snagga puss, strip club husband[x6]
Rain on it

[Verse 1:]
So you workin in a strip club girl, you like yo ass rub
I give you a lecture make it rain like Phil Spector
Football players throwin millions in ma section, I sit back wid hard erection
Everybody texting, your pussy look like wild westin
Cash ma cheque, let me stick ma cheque in
Your ass look like d great mountain I gotta climb tho
Dick hard, I won’t come down, fireman pole
Wid high heels look how you slide down, sittin your fine ass on ma pretty face
You say my balls taste like grapes
You like em wid a finer wine, the big ass you got on yo back is hard to find
Bitch you act like you forgot what I spent
Just ma dick comin in d door was all your rent
Sittin up like a boss so sick I give you money
You say you so moist your pussy taste like lunch meat
Maybach convertible, canary parked across d street
Ma slacks got yo slime on em (slime on em)

[Chorus:]
Rain on a snagga puss, strip club husband[x3]
Rain on a snagga puss
Strip club, strip-strip club,stri-stri-stri-strip club, club strip club
Strip club, stri-stri-strip, strip club, strip club, stri-stri, strip club

[Verse 2:]
Now I’m a hundred in d hole, I’m lookin up in d asshole
Mami’s sittin with Rick Ross I’m countin
Ma girls look like Christina, they take they panties off
Rolls Royce is outside, Dan Marino see d stars
New York Nikki bocky, d pimps call me J.R
Brand new Porsches, trunks packed wit bikinis an bras
Tricks up all night, Biscayne boulevard, I’m makin em bite
Coco Brown I can’t believe last night
I woke up in d bed, fuckin d baddest stripper dat look like Jessica White
Magnum condom, d pussy was high
In d club wit black patrone, they call me bat mike
Batman’s younger brother, poppin bottles with Neyo an Usher
VIP, she want me to put on d rubber
The strippin french fries, get accustomed

[Chorus]
