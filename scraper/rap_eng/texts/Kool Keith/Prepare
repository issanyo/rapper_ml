Yeah, she lookin' good from back there
I know her, I went to high school with her
Check this out, one time when I get time
Um hum

Yo girl, take off them drawers, let's get busy
I'm the road wrecker, they say, "Yo, who is he?"
Put on your boots and your fly little G-string
Like Snoopy Dog said, it's a G thing

I gotta flip your lid, you turn dog style
69, I grind, you come frog style
C'mon freak, I know you swing it every week
Your sticky underwear soggy in the west heat

Don't let me come out to Oakland in a 'Frisco
I don't care where, even in a disco
You pack panties and call your friends up
I put you on the hood, now crank you Benz up

You know the flavor it's titty, titty bang, bang
This ain't no cartoon, chitty chitty bang, bang
Wash the cootie cat, watch the booty rat
Yeah, you know what?

Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come

Now you actin' up, I got the grease up in the bottle
Come and get the work out you hot momma model
You do aerobics, you gonna have to bend over
Smack that butt, no rubbers bring ten over

Stop squeezing your lips and your legs together
I wear my latex suit right in the bad weather
I let my seat vibrate, you on my motorcycle
I have you buggin' and flippin' on your own cycle

You say, man oh Keith, yo my kitten hurt
Let's get on the grass and rugged dirt
You know I'm gentle girl easy no pain to be
I heard you like it form the back coming anally

Let's get a cheap hotel, let's get a cheap motel
I got no time for show and tell
You better step up girl with clean panties
Don't forget your Norforms girl

Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear

Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear

Yeah, I'm standin' naked in the bathroom
Sweepin' your panties with a dust pan and broom
You leave a barrel of drawers I still sniff 'em
Yo Kurt stand back I need a tow truck to lift 'em

I got lotion to pump and more Vaseline
My fantasy to freak a honey using gasoline
I know I scheme on 'em just like a pro
If Dawn was home, I'll send my role to En Vogue

I make ya jump up and down, yo Keith, wind me up
I'm in the closet, yo Keith, come and tie me up
I know you girls out there, I know you like it well
I like pancakes, I wonder how that cat smell?

We in the dark, yo quick yo pull 'em to the side
Yo make it snappy, your mom's waitin' in the ride
You better go home, get ready with the masengil
I'm comin' naked, meet me on the hill

Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear

Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear
Prepare when I come with no underwear

That's right, prepare when I come with no underwear
Everywhere, look around as I dare, you stare
This ain't no drum you tap the snare
This ain't gray bear, look around, smell the air

Prepare when I come with no underwear
