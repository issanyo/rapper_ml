And now
Your MC Champions, Ultramagnetic

[Spoken word]
It's flaming!
I am sealing off the dimensional window
Closing the hole in the fabric of the cosmos like a scar

[Ced Gee]
Ah yeah
One two, one two
This is Agent Bless Ced Gee
Ultramagnetics in full effect
We in here dropping freestyle rhymes like MC Champions
So Keith, take it away

[Kool Keith]
Power compactor, brain distractor
Dropping a bomb right in your anal connector
Sector, vector, the lyric inspector
X-Ray vision, power perfector
Lecktor, Megator, Igor
Ah yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
The rhythm the drop the hit the top to make ya swing or pop
As I flow, pick up the micro-
Phone get hypotension is original
Lyrical miracle, back to attack one
Black one, white one, green one or blue one
Colorful street rhymes, I'm back to do one
Or two of you, three of you, or four of you
Five or six or seven, eleven of you
Wack MCs get back in the last line
And wait on the mic, you think I'm ready to pass mine
Up in the roach hand, with clever ability
I know when to sting a brain, just like I'm a killer bee
Hitting em hard with the rhyme as the flame grow
Hardcore, softcore, and even the rainbow
Polka-dot MC's, African, Indian
Spanish-American, mixed with Panamanian
Arabian Nubian, speaking Siberian
Japanese, Chinese, and regular MCs
Preachers, teachers, and negative creatures
I roll and kick a rhyme, you grab your mic back
Sidewind and rattle like a snake I strike back
I chew your brain and, the monkey behind you
Your company management, the dummy who signed you
To pick up the slack but the hype ain't selling many
Records and tapes cause your rap ain't telling any
Metaphor phases, think that amazes
Me, the next man, no biter but innovator
With lyrical instinct, you look like a duplicator
Bite my style, nibbling on the big jock
With rhymes so tight, they keep your brain in a headlock
Count the one two three four five
I'm like The Bushwhackers tag-teaming your dome
I'm just a champion

[Ced Gee]
Ah yeah, yo Keith, bust this
I got some freestyle rhymes too
I'mma warm up, then I'mma get deep
Bust it, check this out

Yo, poetic genius, kicking metaphor
Ced Gee is the big boss, making it better for
A pile of them, MCs again, I'm ragging them
So listen up my friend
I'm rapping to manifest, people so blind I guess
Type of hype I select, when I rap come correct
My mic is on, and it's loaded, and it's lethal
Here's a dose, a taste of my potential
My super menu winds you bends you sends you
To watch a brother like me, continue
Out on the warpath, flashback, sit back
Kick back with that, dope rap attack
Those that can't rap, with that weak rap
Need to get back, and just to add to that
Fact, with words from the knowledge tip
My rhymes are swift, I have the gift
Like hocus-pocus, Ced Gee, and I'm still on
My mic is loaded with rhymes that flame on
Now you know just what I am creating
We call it mega funk, a plan stating
I'm verbally passing, rhymes are outlasting
Waxing and smashing and kicking more ass and
With intensity, Ced Gee has got to be
Schooling the wannabes, rappers who try to be
Like me, C-E-D
To flow on the mic and show no mercy
I'm a champion, I'm undefeated
My rep is strong, no hype is ever needed
To grow and grow, to grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
To grow and grow, and grow and grow
Rap taller than Buckwheat's afro
I'm a champion
