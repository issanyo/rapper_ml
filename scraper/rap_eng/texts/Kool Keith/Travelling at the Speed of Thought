[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
I go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
As I take your mind off
And on to a new track
To tame dogs how to act
Respect me, when I whip your brain
Skip your brain and dip your brain
In the lotion while I deck ya skull
I'm like a bird when I'm pecking ya skull
Til it hurts and swell, puffs, bleed, blood
Hatches down, ?covering knots for eye jammy?
I'm taking ya brain from the back
I'mma pull out ya ears cuz I'm sick
Traveling hard, ill off, another lunatic
Smacking germs, eating bugs, biting mouse
Roaches wonder why I'm traveling
On to Bellevue cuz I'm sick
Traveling hard at the speed of thought

[Verse 2: Ced-Gee]
Well, I'm back to seek and freak a new remix
Wit the sounds of light and I can't miss
Rocking the beats will cause hard time
Wit the way I say and I freak rhymes
Ruff and hardcore, I wanna encore
I'm Ced-Gee, I'm in an uproar
Taking breaks, snatching, giving X-rays
Read ya cells or should I say
Hey, it's nothing, I'm simply rushing
Into ya skull and merely crushing
Cells, leaving you blind
The more you look, the more you will find
Me, traveling at the speed of thought
