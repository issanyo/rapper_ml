[Intro: Kool Keith/Sampled]
Kool Keith and Figure
The only man alive's fear is of the walking dead

[Pre-Hook: Sampled]
His brain came from a genius
His body, from a killer
His soul came from Hell
Help, there's a murderer!

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Awesome creepy shit
Who can stop my aerial 54 marathon mountain hunter scratch ranger with a husky dog
Di-di-di-digital analog, check the phases on, wake up in the ground with the tasers on
Rocket launch that launch
The stars go through my pores, in the trunk
They primitive, elephant trunk, monster truck, my elephant wears size 28-90 dunks
Destroy retro in one love, who got the camel humps
Work the electric system secret navigator mission
7,000 kiloids, that's how much I've been-

[Pre-Hook: Sampled]
Now SCREAM!
His soul came from Hell
Help, there's a murderer!
