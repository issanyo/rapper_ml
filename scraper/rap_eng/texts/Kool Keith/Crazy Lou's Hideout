TAMMY: OK, but this is the last time I'm covering for you

TARIQ: For real, thank you Boo. I love you

TAMMY: Love you too. Buh-bye

TRU: Aight, the first thing we gotta do is go get you a burner

TARIQ: Yo, why I need a gun? Yo, Tru, you said it would be easy

TRU: Protection, man, just protection. You should have one anyway

TARIQ: True

TRU: And we need to make a stop over at Crazy's lab. He's my weapons specialist

TARIQ: You mean Crazy Lou's on 112th?

TRU: Yeah, he no joke with the biscuits

TARIQ (NARRATION): Now, Crazy Lou was always ill, but highly intelligent. He was an ex-Marine Captain who got discharged for sexual misconduct with a deadly weapon. Ever since then, he hasn't been the same. What's dope about Crazy is that he designs as well as modifies all types of weapons. He got this spot on 112th: an abandoned building, which he redesigned into a metal/weapon shop. Low maintenance, high security

CRAZY LOU: What's the password, nerd?

TRU: "Enema bandit."

CRAZY LOU: OK, enter slowly

TRU: Yo, chill man, it's me, True! I got Tariq with me

CRAZY LOU: Aww, fellas, come on in! Welcome to Weapon World, where if you find a weapon more high-powered at a lower price, I will give your girl a new weave!

TRU: Yeah, OK. I need a weapon for my man Tariq. Today is his first day hustling, so I want to get him something high-powered yet economical, and...

CRAZY LOU: Hmmm. Let me show you what I got. These are my latest designs!
