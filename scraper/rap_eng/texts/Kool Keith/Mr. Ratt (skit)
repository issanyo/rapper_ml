Here little ratty ratty
Here little ratty ratty
That's right come over here
Michael Jackson had one, i'm gonna name you John
Little rat, try to chew on this Bazooka, here's some peanut butter
You're a beautiful rat, no one understands you
You're so cute, look at your grey and your long tail
You're so pretty
Everybody always throwing things at you
Beautiful little rat
