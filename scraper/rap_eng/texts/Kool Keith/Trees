Recycled services, you know the nerve of this
Oxygen gone, you ne- you never heard of this

{*beat kicks in*}

From the forest fire
Movin out, movin out from the forest fire
Movin out the elements
Y-y-y- you know my central intelligence
Like the elephants

Trees are dying (trees are dying)
Trees are dying (trees are dying)
Trees are dying (trees are dying)
Information is more concealed
Trees are dying (trees are dying)
Trees are dying (trees are dying)

Papers get printed
Trees may be extinct like the elephants
(Like the elephants)
You know the advancement for the elegance
Dow Jones Industrial, real like my reels
You know the environmental change and its appeal
Information is more concealed
Info- information is more concealed
Trees are dying
Trees- trees- trees- trees are dying

Scientific study, ask your chemical buddy
Cut McGillicuddy
Dispatchin out to you, imagine, imagine
Usin material for Christmas, I doubt you
Back-back- back to the lab
Back- back-back- back to the lab
Oxygen, oxygen come in
Carbon dioxide comin out to you
Car-carbon dioxide comin out to you
Carbon dioxide comin out to you

Where you get that bench and table from?
Add to the mortgage, one
You made a deficit evilly to boost your sum
Cuttin trees down all around to make you king of the mighty dollar
Increase your ground, sellin boxes from Fort Knox
To challenge your wooden stocks
Breakin into vaulted areas with locks
The trees are...

Watch your atmosphere, pesticides
Control damagin trees and the roots
A bunch of chemicals y'all turnin it loose
