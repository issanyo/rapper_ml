[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Yea, lyrical drills man down x 3
Lyrical drills my flow is accurate
Bones in my nose with the dreads, you would think I’m an African
Waking them up like saccharin, words get thrown at your zone like a javelin
Olympic winners with that white suit on like the spinners
150 wool never catch me with the linens
Tropicana cabana watch him slip up break his neck on the banana
Wheelchair got him stuck with the disability there
Searching to get to the top spot really is rare
I’m a Met, coming out Lee Mazzili get silly
Cut up your strategies break out with the flares
Sitting up in the office space, I’m defacating like the mayor
Colon Powell going to the boards who can stop Sam Mcdowell
The dunk inside broke your hand in McDonalds
I’m on fire with no extinguisher let me light up your Marlboros
I’m the West Indian soccer player you see the cosmos
With wild Irish Rose Jalen bake off the pick
They say Cindy get wick Boston Green
Wearing a Raider helmet I’m a Celtic
Leave a bad taste in they stomach watch him Alka Selz it

HOOK
Lyrical Drills man down
Lyrical Drills man down down
Lyrical Drills man DOWN

[Verse 2: Dave Dar]
I’m a Buddhist , Nudist, Best to do this
In Attack Mode like Roy Jones the Pugilist
In his Prime, my time is like NOW
I gotta be the best pound per pound, round for round
Late Bloomer when I broke out my shell
Now I’m giving Hell in every place we Dwell
You get your power out the barrel of gun
I get my sour and it weighs about a ton
Darryl , Jay, and Run
Me, Ray, and Keith
At the ticker tape parade you know they gave us the keys
The trifecta wrecking every sector
Burning down the stage till’ its 200 degrees
Earth, Wind and Fire on the sunset strip
Richard Pryor
I get the best mic phone grip
With the wire
And if it’s a Cordless, you rappers will forfeit
Then get Tossed in the Fryer
I took the time to study the greats on Acetate
And video tape and Activate
The minds of the deaf dumb and blind
I pity the fake
