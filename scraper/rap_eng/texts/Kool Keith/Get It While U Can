[Hook]
Get it while you can

[Verse 1]
Now I'm activating my acrobats
I'm wearing a cast around my crutch on my tracks
You must want to see me in Cinemax, nigga
Come on baby, they're just a piece of gum in a pack
Arthur Baker, I make 'em pie crust
They want to walk up to another height
And step on a flight with a DC-10, motherfucker
Make yourself comfortable on my Airbus
My mechanics in the ceramics make your hair rust
Press the accelerator and drop up in your elevator
My Pinto's parked inside your neighbors
Parallel with lights blinking
Motherfucker, what the fuck you thinking?
Your head under the car, your ass see the oil leaking
You play Supernigga, why is the boiler leaking?
Rappers got they ass up in the air like Jada Stevens
The pimps backing out the door with my shit on the floor
With they Gators, leaving
I got the contract to jerk you
A lot of artists stuck in my hundred-year agreement
Emcees cry at night, "When you gon' release him?"
Eat all your food, I'm beasting
Chewing on metal pots
You might want to put on a peach bra
And walk away with combat boots
The Army don't want you in here with dreadlocks
The Marines say they can use a mascot
You girl ass so small she can sit in the dial of my watch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your bitch sucking the balls through my Batman jockstrap
I'mma let Robin double-team and put a finger in her asshole
She like when The Joker paint his face light green and unload
The Pengin coming with The Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze
Now that's six of us squirting the cum in the face of one bitch
Girl, you're welcome
Superstar walking your Beverly Hills
Let us watch
Take out your weave and take a shit
I'm wearing goggles with windshield wipers
A lot of fog and rain when I'm in the studio producing shit
Thumbs-up in the cockpit
A bad bitch with a fucsia wig licking my dick
With my seatbelt fastened
I'm ready for takeoff, everything on autopilot
Piss on your Cazal glasses
Delta flight 88-80
Passengers lay back and shit on yourself
We about to fly over these stupid-ass niggas' heads real crazy
I'm still cumming in your girl's face through turbulence
Stewardess rocking back and forth in the cabin
Stay clear out the runway, you bastards
