Yo wassup this Slim, uh oh you don't know me now?
So what, I, oh it's like that, oh okay, okay I see that

I never thought that honey would be playin' I ain't wid it
Forget it, it really don't mean much for me to hit it
Check the resume, baby they don't call me slim for nothin'
Somethin' in her nature had me thinkin' she be frontin'

But last time I checked I had status
But she thinks she's the baddest black
And I ain't havin' that, dig it
Baby what's ya function
'Cause I know you be watchin' me from a far

When I was coolin' at the bar
I am who I are but I ain't a superstar
It's like I wasn't born yesterday, why you tryin' play
Now maybe if I kicked the dummy roll then

You won't be so cold on the shoulder
But now you best move over
'Cause I'm older then you think, think about it
But now you be the one that's lookin' dumb
So Keith give 'em some

Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?

Yeah baby, you just fronted on my man
I'm Keith with the ill pack droppin' funk out the Cadillac
Yo Slim, tell her, she ain't fly need the glass eye
I can see the plastic she don't us a prophylactic

Hangin' out thinkin' she could meet Wesley
Super star movie star, she pulls up in the average car
A green Pinto, license plate say Sacramento
Who's the person in da club beggin' for a drink?

Givin' an eye wink to the brother with a gold link
Her friends lookin' at the parkin' lot the silver Benz
I'm a regular nigga I ain't got no ends
I must be bald look like Bozo The Clown
I'm not your average jerk, you need a job go to work

Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?

Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?

Back again I'm here I still could be on welfare
You don't care walin' by, the wind blowin' in your hair
Lookin' for Sylvester, Arnold Schwarzenegger
A Rolls Royce parked, you left your man in his Vega
What kind of class did your mom teach ya home training?
You walkin' home tonight, awe man it's rainin'

But don't blame the rain because you're weave is loose
And your nails are pressed-on 'cause yo I got the juice
To get another one that looks just like ya
So I don't really sweat the situation, 'cause girl you got me basin'

But how ya like me now, now you know what's goin' on
I'm not a trick, not a sucker, not a slip word it born
Your game is mad young for a second
I can see if you were maybe 16, you be trippin' nah mean?

But hey, it's your life you can choose who you wanna
But I'm gonna get to goin' 'cause I'm knowin' how ya flowin'
Ya flowin' is a joke, ya program is broke
So peace girl, I'll see ya on a later note

Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?

Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?
Honey, tell me wassup, now girl why you frontin'?

Yo Keith, let me tell you
I was cold swingin' it with baby girl in the club right
But don't you know here comes Charles Barkley
Messin' my groove all up
She runnin' over to Chuck because is Benz is silver
And my Mazda's green

But that's all cool though because I wasn't givin' a five cent
For cheese on a Big Mack, it's all good, yo check this out here

Man, I was pulled up man with my black rag-top
In my orange Volkswagen
Man, with my little mag rims
Man, nobody looked at me
