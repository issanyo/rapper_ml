[Verse 1]
I'm slick boss
They call me the man that got the clock ticked off
They say I favor Ricky Rozay
Spanish chicks call me Jose
Northern women from Denmark, Norway
Sippin' the bigger boat all day
Billy say I put the rabbit coat on Shanaynay
Collect street traps
Girls lay up in McDonald's, the rawest taste of Big Mac
Those who don't like the burger workin' get back
Mental progress, 50 grand, she want me to pay for the press
To go under chest less
The governor always play everything recess
Extra clean pants comin' out the cleaners
I want that re-pressed
You missed the one, she didn't make my pants look right
Now I can't make my dance look tonight
8 bottles standin' next to Puff Daddy
I'm already inside
3 other chicks that's black gettin' out the Caddy
Shaneisha, Marina and this other girl named Corina
Kittens in the box

[Verse 2]
As the world goes 'round
Look at me, I'm simply mackin' as I walk through the town
I need some cash, I need a bitch to make my ass rich
I need a bisexual hoe who's down to flip the switch
Because this world that I live in is so cold and rough
You got to watch out for these thugs who think that they're tough
Spinning wheels as the world really starts to change
And every time I look around, my bitch acting strange
Is she cheating on me? She might be beating on me
Help me Lord, have mercy, can you set me free?
Cause I'm really so depressed and I can't decide
If I wanna see tomorrow, I'm thinking suicide
Cause I'm a poor kid, bastard case and my life is a waste
If you think you bad, nigga, come and get you a taste
I'm not in shape to go through rounds, but on your ass I'll pound
Watch the spinning wheels as the world goes 'round

Man these bitches they fully switchin'
It ain't a cake sale mane it's a bake sale
I had a chick call me up the other day, she said
"Uh you think we can go out to uh Olive Garden to eat?"
I said Olive Garden!? I said check this, I'ma set sail
Cause I'ma set you some bail
I'ma take you to Burger King, you know?
And we gon' hit the three dollar menu
One dollar for every burger and one piece of fries
If you can't understand then I can't be your man
I don't know what's up with these chicks, man
They think it's a cake sale but it's a bake sale
I seen better faces on a clock, better legs on a table
And better butts on a cigarette
What you wanna do, bitch? Boogaloo, barbecue or both of you?
This is your A1 yola candy cola black pro soldier giving up love, you understand?
I'm giving up more love than a mothafucking love connection
That's a TV show!
This rap game is real, bitch! You know, get down, get down
You know what I'm saying? Get down for your crown
Cause you fucking with a mothafucka who been on the track
And I've been around
Shouts go out to Kool Keith, Innovative Studios
My man DJ Ill Side from the trill side
Doug [?], High Horse Music Group
And your candy cola A1 yola black pro soldier
You know a nappy head black bitch ain't shit, I'm gon' tell you why
Cause she'll double cross you every mothafuckin' time
Get down, nigga and be about your cash and stop worrying about the ass, boy
I'm out, yo like a shotgun blast from a fuckin' 12 gauge, nigga
Can you feel me? BLAM BLAM BOOOOM
