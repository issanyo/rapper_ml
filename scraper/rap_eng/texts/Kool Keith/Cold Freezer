[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Most of these rappers like gingerbread man
I cut off their heads, separate they torso and go to [?] and burn they fuckin' legs
Come outside for breakfast and all the eggs
My sixteen's a cuttin' edge
A hundred dalmatians in the pickup truck, scarlet red
Santa Clause lookalikes, lose weight and get on your sled
Under the door I feed these cats a calorie, like bread
Standback with the sawed-off and piss on they bedspread
Who wanna call paramed? Walk into Burlington Coat Factory
And my alter ego Hungry Jack with me
Fuck that bellbottoms, no pants real skinny
[Deliver Ears?] in the back to Jimmy, hop in the corvet
Put a brick on the gas pedal, watch it crash into your private jet
MCs go into a cold sweat, refrigerator
These rappers throw 'em out with [cold necks?]
Send turkeys with stuffin' up they ass, to impress [and plan?] in Quebec
Hunnid boots with long trench
Rappers hide in the basement with a flashlight when I do dat they peek out the door and say "who dat?"

[Verse 2: Bumpy Knuckles]
Real spitters call Bumpy for that work
Authenticated, since bars was created
Locked into a groove, chokin' out murder flow
Sendin' you this dirty vocal shit I do so, you know
Punk, I need this to be clear
Like the .44 magnum spittin' [?] to ya icy ears
I'm Jack Frost I see tears icin' in your beard
You nice now, I've been nice for years
In Timb boots, crocodiles or the Nike Airs
Lord Finesse is my [?], I'm like [Fox L?]
Not swell, cause I box well
Freeze niggas deep freezer, Jeffrey Dahmer
My brother died I got Jeffery's Karma, huh
My hood's Obama, no matter what a nigga do
Never is it good enough, real so we hooded up (word)
When niggas shake your hand and don't like how you flow create
'Cause I'm not a dick rider, I'm exposed to hate
It's unfortunate you can't relate
Like the fire in the sub-zero, I'm your rap hero
Three-eighty in a {rap hero?]
It's blood mayonnaise all over your tomato, call Judge Shapiro
In Japan I co-signed Muro
While you was overseas slavin' for a couple euro, you know
