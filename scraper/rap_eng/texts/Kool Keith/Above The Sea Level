Above sea level
That remix to get you
(The next level)
This is, a Agallah, Don Bishop production
(The next level)

Yeah, Tashan, Dorrsett
(The next level)
Come correct
(The next level)

We got junkadelic in the house
(The next level, the next level)
New York City
(The next level)
Paris, France

I'm writin' two millimeters above level
Three centimeters above devil, you know the spot
Meet your face, I deal with the freckle, the right check-o
Any time on the table promoters head to the back
Before they show, I gotta settle

Party down, park the Bacardi down
Stack Atari sound, I'm revved up at 100 point 1
I'm sorry Charlie the crowd, geeked up on bottles of barley
Don't let them get off the Harley

Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule
Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule

The second chance 'n' you better believe
The lyrics spin like the legs of a break dancer
First turn like a potential, meteorite burn
You know how we do, with heavy EQ

Mechanical nigga workin' hard like R2-D2
Star Wars, III episode
Move at red code with vitamins for a stuffed up nose
And a head cold

You see 'em swallowin' on the bars of a head load
They can't handle my opposite jam selection
No Michael 'Jam' perfection
I release atomic fibers at the end of every note
Like the urine stains hittin' off your white coat
(The next level)

Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule
Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule

The next level, the next level
The next level, the next level

I deal easy with this
You witness the climax raw on the twister
More higher my gold records
Hang on my walls like the Pointer Sisters

The biggest elaborate funk, action for your trunk action
It's all the best, speakin' the best
Speakin' from New York to Paris
Junkadelic, eatin' at the restaurant
With Red Ron, we're eatin' salads
(The next level)

Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule
Above sea level, the first treble production remastered
I'm more than you perpetual, I hope y'all on schedule
