[Intro]
Yeah, Nigeria
The African government
Sudan
Or some different shit

[Verse 1]
I'm geared towards the big dominant game
The shit I flip it
Bassline muscle
Turn inside the fuckin' dunk over
Nenad KrstiÄ‡, ya seven foot sinner
Saw my nuts in his face, oh shit
The crowd missed it
Now The Nets gotta regroup and call a time-out
I'm fuel-exhausted from the stomach up
I shit a rhyme out
Cobra on top of my hat spit a rhyme out
The golden mummies make a statement
Ya chick piss on the couch
The Nigerian queens feed the king
Time is cereal
That's some shit that you won't even get close to ya fuckin' mouth
Golden dogs walk around the fuckin' house
With navigation connected to your bitch eyebrows
The stars crystal off my pubic hair
While you face the throne
18 million for the princess Diana's chair

[Hook]
Somalia, Egypt, somewhere (x3)

[Verse 2]
I piss on your toenails, paint ya feet all black
You ain't no official fuckin' mack
Skinny legs on your ass stand up weak from cocaine
What's that green fungus growin' from your bitch
Cum in my face with pinkeye
You think magazines tell you the truth?
Look at your face surgery, it's a goddamn shame
Now they got you with a little bony ass
With very Ugg boots, and celebrity sleuth
The pop sensation let you wipe my ass for me at the radio station
Your bitch know I got good sense
Walkin' up to the Chinese restaurant with the cobra hat
You see where the man is, you fuckin' know where the cobra's at
Your bitch got bed lice from dirty hotels
She move with the clap
Ya'll wanna find the prince, you better get that fuckin' Africa map

[Hook]
Somalia, Egypt, somewhere (x3)

[Verse 3]
Now watch me walk the camel on top of your fuckin' head
The Arabs trade me oil, and make deals
Horses run at you at in desert, a hundred degrees
I don't need wheels, you motherfuckers in America fight for skills
And top-ranked monkeys, they top-ranked flunkies
With no pyramid status
These peasants and shitstains, they keep comin' at us
The lord abracadabra, shit-talker, Al Jazeera bragger
Get out my face with a cheap-ass phone camera
And practice your goddamn grammar
You can't spell for shit, you can't talk and tell for shit
Now you wanna turn around and talk with shit on your lips

[Hook]
Somalia, Egypt, somewhere (x3)
