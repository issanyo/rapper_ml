[Kool Keith]

Yes! As we interrupt
For sisters out there ovulating
Brothers out there... doing private things
Let's get busy!

[Chino XL]

I be the receiver, of strange mind patterns
No type of compassion, endless my though process
Hits like a dark cavern, I was bred of toxic parents
Embryonic stages underdeveloped fetal pages that I burnt like phasers
Releasing human excrements on you like Tawana Brawley
Thinking to myself like Pee Wee Herman caught jerking off
I wish nobody saw me, wishing I could hide vibe Kool Keith we spark this
We step on stage MC's dissapear like the rain forest
So when I rocks again get oxygen get cameras on
No telling diverse curse selling I'm reversed like Hammer son
Mental capacity, hindered like I'm Forrest Gump
Bu-dump, for your trunk
Get you hooked like crack hooked Humpty Hump
I catch the *real* with more sick humor than Benny *Hill*
I slap you up and make you *feel* what DeVon *feel*
You cry like Dice Clay, like Kunta Kinte I gets loose
You blowin up's a fucking dream like the gang truce

[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] They be perpetratin live, like they wild on the avenue
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] But they signed they lives away, now they don't know what to do
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] I catch em perpetratin streets over beats when they through
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo *echoes*

[Kool Keith]

Super flexin, yo Chino XL, let's inhale
Funky sex man naked, foresmith is bound to shoot the gift
Riff riff raff, rappers make me giggle giggle laugh
From the East coast to Texas, I kick a rhyme like Pele
Strolling knee deep, you take a peep, while my beeper beep
Catchin wreck one two one two achoo achoo achoo
Sneezing and pleasing, on your ear, verbal easing
Chocolate flows then drips down through your nose
Between your legs, I bend your head with beer kegs
True, I'm blue, the smith can't stick to doo-doo
Yo Chino we needle we brown with the King Crown
Rockin underground bound, and pullin girls panties down
Yo check it, yo step with, you puppet muppet nitwit
Energizing like forty volts, I'm shocking to your anal
With my goggles paisano, Spiderman against the Rhino
Leaping on your building, downtown Los Angeles
Skandalous man, shooting sperm in your perm
Leaving ways to dry, my urine dropping in your eye
Burning afro puffs, with that greasy sticky stuff
I get rough, and plant my seed into your rectum
Masterbating at warp speed, I pull up in your spectrum

[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] While they be perpetratin live like they wild on the avenue
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] Mad cause they signed they lives away now they don't know what to do
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] I peep em perpetratin streets over beats cuz they through
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo *echoes*

[Chino XL]

Heh heh, let's see who I be now
The I-N-O behind the C and the H
With the X add the L I can spell cause I ain't Dan Quayle

[Kool Keith]

Pediatrician my mission Uncle Fester with the skills
Making Lurch reactivate Morticia's only child was style

[Chino XL]

Sleeping on me like a narcolypetic as I grow
But you'll be here today and gone tomorrow like The Afros
Like a child alone with Luther, your ass in danger
MC's collect my styles like small kids do Power Rangers

[Kool Keith]

You holding back on the feeble, small weasel
No handicap love, elephants on the fence
Ever since dinosaurs, people stood on Crenshaw
And palace fade shopping lades, you never saw before
Bouncing down with more bounce, with music by the ounce
With my finger between the mean California labia
Dark girl maybe-ia, I think her name is Evia
Avon computer flex, killin mice and insects

[Chino XL]

I'm, sliding into this beat like
Hot thermometers into your anal channel
I toss that ass up like
A gang sign but not wearing flannel
I'm prefacing like George Jefferson, WHEEZY!
Chino XL my brother B-Wiz and Kool Keith
Now try to take it easy

[Kool Keith]

My range is high rise, do people know I'm circumcised
Cut back with the skin, come now, come in come again
I make light dark, you pimple faced birds
Wipe your mouth with Clorox, I clean with Spic and Span
Leave a magical tissue, and yellow vomit in your hand

[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] Uh-huh, perpetrating live like they wild on the avenus
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] And now they signed they lives away and they don't know what to do
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Chino] I caught em perpetrating streets over beats cuz they through
[Keith] Gangstas flop, they go pop like Shabba-Doo
[Both] Ask your label, I bet they let you do it too

[Kool Keith]

Yes
Always wash your hands with the Lubriderm after leaving the public toilets
Remember that... we must keep the earth clean

Lavratories
Remember all the camoflouge Tampax
