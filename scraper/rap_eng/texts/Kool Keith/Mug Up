Mug up
Mug up

(Chorus)
Mug up that root beer
That Hennessy, that root beer (x9)

(Verse 1: Kool Keith)
I’m poppin’ up electric
My boogie go in sections
I’m risin’ up erections
My balls give you lessons
My hair don’t you mess with
My pubic in that Lexus
I ride down through Texas
My tour bus through exits
These girls get my attention
Them wheels on them Benzes
I film night car lenses
I get gas in Memphis
She measure up my inches
I’m raw yo, pretentious
I rent rooms, make cents
That thong’s wet, let’s get it in
No conscience, let’s do it again
Repeat this, it’s Loch Ness
Monsters, watch this
Belaire bottles, no Sunkist
I run this, hundreds
These women come, they tongue-kiss
We drink a fifth, no competish
You clean the spoons, wash the dish

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Kool Keith)
Innovate, percolate
Scale up, show ‘em weight
In their face, watch more
Free base, blue smoke
Prepaid, motel
Getting laid, watermelon
Sit in the shade, Cadillac
Grey escalade, Gatorade
Pay to play, Minute Maid
Orange juice, I’m finished maid
Bowling ball, down the lane
Comes with ice, cellophane
Styrofoam, on your phone
People call, I’m not home
Kenneth Cole, push truckers lows [?]
Carry out them ozones
Girls love me like Mike Jones
With lights on, with Nikes on
Jump strong and jump long
Women rise, they jumpin’ thongs
I beat my chest like King Kong
Moet Nect, six Chandons
She waitin’ to take them pants off
(Mug up that, mug up that)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Project Pat)
Hennessy, spread like Tennessee
You know Project B
Sippin’ on that shit all day
Loan, it’s gon’ cost a fee
If you ain’t got no money, you’s a damn fool
If you ain’t got no damn bread, you gon’ lose
Them choppas get to spittin’, bodies get to flip (All day)
Bony nigga’s pockets and I get to spend (All day)
Guess I did, she goin’
All these bitches hoein’
Aw man, that’s your bitch, ‘scuse me, she goin’
She swallowin’ up dick like Pac Man eat dots
This bitch ain’t nothin’ but a mothafuckin’ thot
She had me in yo’ house, had me at yo’ spot
And that’s why to yo’ head bitch, it’s a Glock

(Chorus)

(Outro: Kool Keith)
