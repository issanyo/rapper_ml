[Verse:]
Space trodicious
Revolutionary thoughts
Filthy rich like sex
Easy money to spend down the berlin and wait curling
It's like the world spins
Filthy rich like the sex with the neighbours
The cat on the couch makes it famous
Wearing my nike trainers
Running around
Space challenger
Coasting easy top notch
With watch ready to clock
The formulas coming in like robots
Females they know not
Memorize though easy violated
Point of demonstrating
Everything be TV related
Television debated
Vocals up large centipated
Sounds elevated
Make me famous
Coasting down hill slower
Cutting like the lawn mower
Did you no effects
Bomb next
Express thoughts build up that's right of course
Change course before
With the time instinct
Off the link
Latitude
Helicopter
Eating lobster
Like a mobster
Italian style Italian smile
Italian fowls  Italian laughs
Change up
Switch to another craft
Four minutes settled
Another watch with the bezel
You get it
Another flight
Another flight
