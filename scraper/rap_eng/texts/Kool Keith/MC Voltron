[Verse 1]
Rap done turned microscopic
Defecated on the floor and watch the butcher chop it
Play of the pick with cream for jock-itch
I wear a wrestling mask
The ladies show ass in front of Bernard Hopkins
Rap so toy I play with Shopkins
Write with a marker like Al Sharpton
Leave the rest constipated with Swanson
They might wanna have a phone conference
Coach the best to swing on my balls like Tarzan
Take off like an aircraft
They got diarrhea all I see is brown potatoes, mash
Just inches off the floor—just one-and-a-half
People get cozy and sit inside the paragraph
Levitate like the nouns and the adjectives
Natural ingredients I add for the kids
Urine stains on your ad-libs
Bradley all like Milton sleep inside Paris Hilton
We can play with Spaldings or Wilsons
New verses for new children
Pull up in the Phantom with pilgrims
The sky's like Phil Simms

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Craig G]
Beats to rap to—I'll use it to collapse you
Deadly, like swallowing a cyanide capsule
Open up that hatch, duke, it's time to make my getaway
I'll melt your nervous system, look; and I ain't even spit a eight
Double up that dinner plate, I bought a hearty appetite
Even heart the opposition when we're in the after life
Right? It's like a hip-hop poltergeist
Ignore them signs, light up, shit, we gon' smoke tonight
"Craig G? That son of a bitch!"
Will be an asshole if he lives to be 106
Pull up on you at the light, make fun of your chick
Have you so blinded with rage you probably run into shit
You ain't comin' to quip—I can talk and none of ya gettin'
The gun to put one in your hip—it's all fun till your hit
And the description's kinda hazy
And going in the light's the only time you're feelin' wavy
Galaxy Alliance—the lions of the cause
Forming Voltron on that ass, using spectacular bars
Slow your roll, Paw
