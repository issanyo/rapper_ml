Beautiful island baby, just you and me
Eatin canteloupe by the water
My everlastin queen I want to have my son
Give me a beautiful daughter
No other woman in the world
You are the queen of my life, my #1 girl
Takin you places you never been before
Blessin you faces you never seen before
You make my sunlight, you make my heart pour
With us ridin the horse and chariot around Central Park
Starin at the beautiful light, I smell your aroma
After dark the most sensous
Our love is everlastin incredible, most continous
The top of the mountains, I climb up it's a must
Eternal love (eternal loooove)

[singing]
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want you to be - yeahh
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you - I want you... I want you, yeah I want you

With my pen releasing the thoughts to your emotional setback
The stress you had is gone, my job is to make you forget that
Enhance your private life, pick up your veil over your face
It's time to make you my wife, for dear life
With infinite time and destination
I'm over the lust beyond the consultation
Ready for the boats with the tender cruises with you FOREVERRR
I wanna relax on vacation
You could be black, white, asian, latin or indian
Dominican and Haitian; with true and honest eyes
It's you I'm facin, and the fierce situation
You made me who I am now, my mind is under all different types
Of enjoyin weather in the deep relation
Your feelings are ready for elevation
I need you now to meet me at the station
I need you NOW... to meet me at the STATION
You gotta be there on time

[singing]
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want you - yeahh
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you -- I want you, I want you -- I want you-hooo

[Kool Keith]
I can't think no more, I cry to myself by the bed
I can't sit by the sink no more
Your perfume lingers in my room with the overjoy and pain
I think about you even when it doesn't rain
If the highway was given to you
We would bypass the gridlock and switch into the lover's lane
My extreme thoughts of you, put no other above you
My stare is constant, my eyes say I love you
With the time and essence; I'm overwhelmed with the moment
Many times happy with your presence
Season to season, I'm only weak as you make me
I stopped you in the broad daylight for the reason
I can't tell you the texture of the time shock
With the stopwatch tickin, and the time it took
I'm into the popular sequences
If anything, my diary's full
Girl you on my BLOCK, you in my BOOK
Eternal loooooooove - love

[singing]
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want youuuuuu - yeahh
I want you to be that one for meee - I want you to beee
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
