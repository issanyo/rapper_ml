[Intro:]
How’s he doing doctor
Still in a deep comatose state Colonel
Comes out of it periodically
But obviously hallucinating

[Chorus:]
Dr. Bipolar [x4]
Go ahead Dr

[Verse 1:]
Fantasy lyrics bipolar express
Dr. Bipolar ride around with a marriage
Reflecting the same serum injected
Respecting the fourth man messes far from the
Ninth dog in tight white drawers
In the house watching Mr. Steak
Coming by making house calls
Am i right or am i wrong

[Chorus:]
Dr. Bipolar [x3]
I’m tearing off
My heart belongs to my heart belongs to my heart belongs to

[Verse 2:]
Enough to skip off the beat it’s like sneakers walking down on the dark road on the beat
Harry Potter lent with heat the sorcerer gripped with monkeys jumped out the jeep
Tells us of tripping of the doctor’s cruise ship
Bringing in paramedics and stretchers with hits
Sewing them stitches
Dr. Bipolar [x2]
I’m tearing off
My heart belongs to my heart belongs to my heart belongs to [x2]
This time I’m watching myself impersonate another person
Without rehearsing
The owl saying Who to the hostess
With the tracks stacked up
Count Dracula step up with cocoa gloves
Make up
Dr. Bipolar get proper love
Dr. Bipolar
Dr. Bipolar
Dr. Bipolar
I’m tearing off
Ray is putting you to sleep to sleep
Relax and sleep sleep
