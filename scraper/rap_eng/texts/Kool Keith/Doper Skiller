[MF Doom/Viktor Vaughn]
People came from miles around to hear Vik rock it
He learned a few new styles since a two year old pick pocket
Kra-dow! Sad how sickenin
Now get retarded like mad cow kickin in
Yik! Chris wasn't trickin
And what's in the stew if the flu was in the chicken?
We all got our vices
Some got the gall, ta call the shots off the dices
And that's Vik, brings slaughter to your section
Have ya'll emcees get a order of protection
His name rings bell said Jake
He sings well, even with his king hell headache
Hit' em with a anvil, a trigger, a scandal
If not just to get free press off the Nigga Channel
He only plays for high prices
And rates his hourly rate based on how nice he is

[Kool Keith]
There's a lot of "I'll murder you" raps
With lame ass guys out of nowhere
Corny asses, I never heard of you cats
Guys like you mess up a lot of tracks
Ask your neighborhood about me
Why you rappin' act tough and grizzly
Urinate on your jacket and leave you pissy
Start jockin, get your autograph I'm missing
Defecate on your best line
Spit three verses in the cup and get busy
A wack ass comin this way
Must be cross eyed and dizzy
You don't listen enough, see me pissin enough
Leave ya yellow spots around your bed area
Defecate around your head area
Precise when I meet that ass
And greet that ass, the brain or what
Defecate on your apartment on Poinsettia
