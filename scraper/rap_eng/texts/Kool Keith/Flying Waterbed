[Verse 1 - Dr Octagon]
Simultaneous knee cracks
Like Kobe injured
Dr. Octagon sit on space beach with a bucket hat
Way beyond the fitted and the snapback
3.5 million served
My wings make you look like atomic birds
Flying like a UFO with the rockets
They must be sniffing stardust in their show
Nasal so big I can fly aircraft up your nose
Raw vocal clouds like George, so Astro
With the largest selection of Texas Instruments
Who– spacewalk rappers like your microwave shoes
Young astronaut sit on the pot and tie my shoes
Find mysterious discoveries
The star don’t by all means
I’m still hot in space for many it’s a dream

[Chorus]
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Dedication, all my love for you)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Hand in hand in summer's brighter view)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(No more lies and not quite knowing)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Dedication, all my love for you)

[Verse 2 - Dr Octagon]
The catch is to comprehend
The studio packed with 5 thousand green men
Ruled by an action figure
Activated sleeping in
Upon the top of the sun so goddamn hot I actually made it
Barney the purple dragon
Pop in the set, recline, faders
On the guest list with the Power Rangers
When way up in the nebula 18
It’s hard to find X when I stop on earth to entertain
Tough floating gravity, you see the girls up here bathing
Even the movies in the head mess up the rocket
Your lady know what Shane Diesel did
You’re so low down, the flying saucer hover above your crib
Look out the aircraft I see you rolling the blunt like you big

[Chorus]
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Dedication, all my love for you)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Hand in hand in summer's brighter view)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(No more lies and not quite knowing)
Come take a ride on my flying waterbed
(Dedication, all my love for you)

[Verse 3 - Dr Octagon]
My place look like the Oracle when Golden State play
I’m a Martian with a Stephen Curry face
Your girl like when I grip her waist
Release the fluid like toothpaste
Always mobbed in your atmosphere
I gotta disguise myself with a toupee
The afro got me in tube socks looking like Dr. J
76-er in the Spectra with Qbert and Automator on the mixer
Muscle man aside watch me lift my own spaceship up
Your girl want my babies in a crystal cup
People say “how high you get?”
I got keys to flying trucks

[Outro-Refrain]
There’s no drag
It’s no drag momma
There’s no drag when we roll to Rome
Its no drag
There is no drag momma
It’s no drag when we roll
Dedication all my love to you
Let me lay the stream inside of you
Summer nights you’re always glowing
Dedication all my love to you
