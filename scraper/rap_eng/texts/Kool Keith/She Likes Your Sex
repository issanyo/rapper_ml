[Kool Keith]
Yeah, Kool Keith baby, I'm laid back
I'm laid back - I'm just chillin
Yo I'm in the tub y'knahmsayin
That lingerie looks good you got on..
That's right - yeah let them be hardcore
(Let them be HARDCORE!  Let them be HARDCORE!)
Yeah, let them be hardcore (let them be hardcore)

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
She likes your sex - yeah
She likes your sex... yeah
She likes your sex

[Kool Keith]
Masturbatin at night, playin with herself for delf
The lotion controller, rub her back
Hit her with the real loader
Ginseng with the roots, black heels with them boots
She likes your sex...
The waiting in the dressing room, who's ready to come out next?
Yeah...

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
She likes your sex... yeah
She likes... she likes your sex... yeah
She... yeah... she likes

[Kool Keith]
Bathroom hot, I steam you
Go 'head, turn over and dream too
Watch you cream to, Ben & Jerry's ice cream
Between your buttcrack, you want that
Call me, I'm guaranteed, you'll run back
Oooh, ooooh

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
She likes your sex... yeah
She likes your sex... yeah
She like it - she likes your sex

[Kool Keith]
Whether or not, the Billboard Awards
For a whack pop star, winnin a Grammy
Jacuzzi bathtub, with Latin music playin in Miami
Coppertone tan doe, girl take off your panties
No need for girdles and grannies
The R is Zorro, I'm Batman though
Adam West, get in the Batmobile
Baby I treat you real, take you to the Batcave
Me and Robin double team you
I love the way you moan and scream too

[Outro: Kool Keith]
She likes your sex...
Yeah, she like it - she likes it
She likes your sex... yeahh, yeah
She likes your sex - she likes your sex
She likes your sex... yeah, ooooh yeah
That's right baby, get in the tub
You're authentic, just, bounce a little bit
Put on a thong, pull it to the side
