[Intro/Chorus]
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

[Verse 1]
I got the Rosay bottles with the tracks overlay
Sunk down in the brown Lamborghini chocolate (?) overpaid
My canary mink go with the green hat like the Oakland A's
Select a vision
Y’all see me on television
The man who drives his cars into the kitchen
Women love me like George Benson
Rolls Royce, this the tenth one
Red carpet with Jane Dickerson
[?] wear my ring with the [?]
All this cash from managing Bob Backlund
Rappers come outside to see me in the convertible Acuren
Tell Bonnie and Clyde I'm stacking up
[?] with the blazer
Be it like Walt Frazier
Tell your co-owners they owe me a couple of favors
Bring side seats and some big deals
First gotta replace chrome with the black phantom grilles

[Chorus]
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

[Verse 2]
Four, five Corvettes
My maids work in corsets
Everything they wear, includin' their thongs, smell like Chanel Toilette
My agent handle Chris Paul, they know where I ball at
Regency higher, if you’re blonde you might get hired
All night the camera's in the valet
I'm so admired
I guess you Richard, that means you're a Pryor
I love the comedic ways, boxes get wrapped
That's the way the Porsche came, salsa with chips
Ask Wade if Gabby still with Dwayne
That's that rap chick soaked when she see me in the pants
I might have to slide in the VIP
Into the MGM Grand
Figurin' out while you make up stories to tell your man
Ocean Spray with Cherry Pendergrass it
Make you change positions with a Teddy
Fly you back home with memories
Let Delta know you're ready
To board on time ‘cause I know they bored out of their mind
Calvin Murphy won’t be short, guaranteed
You better ask Klein
The [?] brothers with Adrian Devine

[Chorus]
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop

I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
Bottle pop, bottle pop, bottle pop
I like the bottle pop, bottle pop
