[Hook]
Sorta break it down like this

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, Kool Keith's brother, Sinister 6000
Four thou, 39 kilowatts
Drop lyric, eternal funk combined
Blah, blah, supersonic force
Colt .45s amped up
Gates pump, compressors leak
Maximum outstrength the bass
Tweeters stretch your limbs
JBL, Dolbys, Adacs, Impacts
Transfer to the wax
Sinister 6000, new rap styles I be housing
My style is Europe
Freestyles that pump in Amsterdam
Rip the Mackie 32, expanding new Pro Tools
Stadiums packed with speakers, 15000 people
Digital formats with Sony amps pumping equal
We're rapping fire
No joke, I'll burn your crew for hire
With big dynamics, on this atomic aerobics
Female vocals choke, them highs get them systems broke
Buy software that's industrial, metal hardware
Vocal rap 4000
At least these X2 war compounds like high tech voodoo
Sequence range is strange like maggots growing in your brains
8000 bugs crawling on your skin
I'm back again my friend
Sinister 6000, 5'11", 7000
Black monsters in the house
Who want to step to the invisible man
As I chamber, like you in command
