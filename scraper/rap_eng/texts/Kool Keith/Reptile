[Intro:]
Yow what’s up international!
This reptile-aka green lizard
Somebody run to d store, who gon’ get a fifth a mad dog
Forget d chain dat like to go kneecaps
Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check

[Verse 1:]
I’m Corleone, Michael P homey, who could deome
Thought she was wet, why yo bitch had to pee on me
I’m jumpin over legs that be bony, takin em under ma wings like a lil homey
I’m burnin up I’m black macaroni, the crowds wanna know me
Leave at odds wit crouch feet bogs like Lawrence Fishburne
I cup a beat drop a curd on yo loose leaf
You choose, peeps, gaming style like Ron Laud
You must be using crack vile, big 10 gallon cowboy hat
You see uncle Texas style, uncle Texas wow
Wit Chinese eyes I mix wit ching chao
First cousin to chingo bling, you see d chingo ring
I’m rippin d smithereens, takin d yard, I come with crochard for d US Marines
My commander uniforms I pissed in it, why you think I’m usin the washin machine

[Chorus:]
Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check(reptile!)
Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check(Killer Chink!)
Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check (reptile!)
Engine on check, VIP on check, girls is on check (Killer Chink!)

[Verse 2:]
My demeanor is devious, I’m a dark crease
Y’all niggas delirious tryna pray for me
I’m sociopathic I let the beast free
I hunt like a savage I want fresh meat
I think I got issues I think I need a shrink
I know I’m a alcoholic so I need a drink
Sometimes I think that I’m special, shit I’m full of dreams
The only thing I’m good at is selling crack to d fleet
I’m jaded, I’m ported, don’t drink d water
One of the 7 seals break me an witness slaughter
I’m d pimp that’s responsible for whoring yo daughter
But I’m a rebel so I hate new world order
Call me crazy, you probably right
Look in ma eyes, they say genocide
I hate everything, I want blackness
Killer Chink, I come wit kill tactics
Killer Chink!

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Reptile!
Killer Chink!
Reptile! (reptile)
