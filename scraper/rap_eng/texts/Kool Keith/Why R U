Why are you the one?
I can't lose

What's the reason that I'm here again? It's crazy
I keep waitin' but I'm foolish 'cause you'll never change
Wasted all my time and here I am still cryin' over you
Over you

Hey, loving you was so hard but I keep tryin' baby
I just end of with scars 'cause I keep fightin' baby
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm asking you
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about?
Why are you the only one?

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one

And though I hate it, hate it that I can't forget you
I try my best but I'm a mess 'cause I can't shake you
Wanna call you but my pride won't let it get the best of me
The best of me, no

Loving you was so hard but I keep tryin' baby
I just end of with scars 'cause I keep fightin' baby
Loving you is like a battle that I can't afford to lose
I can't lose

But I'm askin' you
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about?
Why are you the only one?

Baby you're no good for me, no you're no good
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one

No can't believe that I'm still cryin'
And no it ain't because I ain't been tryin'
Losin' sleep 'cause I can't help but think about the past
And how we didn't last, how we didn't last

Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about?
Why are you the only one?

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one

Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing that I care about?
Why are you the only thing I think about?
Why are you the only one?

Baby you're no good for me, no
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
You can be, you can be, you can, you can be the only one
