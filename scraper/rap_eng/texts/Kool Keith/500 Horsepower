[Verse 1:] [Kool Keith]
Take em out to dinner
When the scent off in the candle
When I skinned them only make a minute
Fan dem cop it, don’t rent it
Push the regular independent
Get the house forward tenants
Baseball nine innings
They can see my side winning
Beat her like I’m John Lennon
Plan like a band member
Fan tip a big dick
A girl drop low liquor
100 proof black pooch
White cow on the douch
Farmer like a milli
Moving trap in the city
I’m a pig, I’m a guinea
Oink
Oink
Dunking to the basket
I’m rigid but benoink
Service through the side sexing
Service where they learn a lesson
Masturbate with Smith & Wesson
Will I ever sign to Deffin
Def Jam only 7
Tell the kings my name is Devin
[Warped sample] golly I didn’t know he could rap
Girl make your cheeks clap

[Chorus:]
Wacka wacka [x8]
500 Horse [x2]

[Verse 2:] [Big Sche]
Everyday is Friday
Pimp day, don’t play
Got these motherfuckers hittin da highway or my way
500 beat blocks
Fo’ lo’, do scoop
Bitches in the back and my homie in the side foo’
My shit, my rules
You don’t wanna act a fool
Either way you do it
See a gangsta going keep his cool
Big Sche, cool geek
Memphis TN, NY
You wanna fuck with the god
Then you gots to comply
Yes I’m arrogant
Confident
No slack
But you fail to realise
Just the essence of a man
I’m supposed to be
That nigga that don’t give a fuck
If you got a problem nigga
Tough fucking luck
I’m a hungry hippo
I want every buck (every buck)
I take chances
I play chicken with MACK trucks (Mack trucks)
I never foreplay hoes
I just bust a nut (bust a nut)
Triple OG gangsta
In a black tux

[Chorus:]
Wacka wacka [x8]
500 Horse [x2]
Wacka wacka [x3]
500 Horse [x2]
Wacka wacka [x2]
500 Horse
Wacka wacka [x3]
