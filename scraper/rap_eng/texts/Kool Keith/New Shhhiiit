[Intro]
Yeah, this is some old NEW shit that you ain't never heard before
"Th-th-th-th-th-th-this is the new" "new shit"
Yeah, this is some old NEW shit that you ain't never heard before
"New shit" "Th-th-th-th-th-th-this is the new"
Yeah, this some old NEW shit
That you ain't never never never heard before
"Th-th-th-th-th-th-this is the new"
Yeah, this is some old new NEW shit
That you ain't never never never heard before
[Kool Keith]
Metaphysics, the new cats, they on the dizzicks
The kinetic waveform, you got a retarded welcome backwards
They full potential against the mental the frental
The conventional the Kingdome cream of Sonya, Sonya
Take Shaun Dorrsetty, I'm ready beat every freakin fairy
Confetti, them niggas are Betty - they can't worry
Soft they crunchin up like the prune and strawberry
Jello to jelly they live in our belly
Ladies with thongs movin booties in the ho-telly

[Chorus] - variations of the Intro
[Kool Keith]
Sham doo, sham Kool
You bitch I'm tellin 'round like Clam Do
Legend like Wamboo
I'm grand dude, reclining chair and the fan too
Double otter, boat on the water
B sail, I'm a rider (I'm a rider)
From Nevada, Afrika Bam, Jam
Planet Rock all like badda, deep dada
Leap over Kotter, I'm full of V8 granada
I stay hotter, like an enchilada
You gotta watch my pockets or get smacked
With a knotter you wet Siotta{?}
When the motorcycle club come up I'm a rider
Male outer dam a gram, from Scotland to Amsterdam
Cut off your hamster's hand
You don't wanna bring a child to rap against a man
Gifted, lifty, shifty
Mixey ladies at the bar gettin tipsy
My Huskie name was Shisky
Y'all drunk red lips on whiskey

[Chorus] - more variations of the Intro
[Kool Keith]
I pull you out of the sheepskin, you deep skin
You peep when your pager beepin when I freaks in
You see what a deep blend, I call you Tom McCougar
You ain't strong, you a 100 pound weakling
Eatin franks to build your chest up on the weekend
I was down, and I'm still what you speaking
While you tweaking your crack pots and keep cooking
Soaked your radiator leaking, fuck with the world
[Outro - varations of the two samples below to end]
"New shit" "Th-th-th-th-th-th-this is the new"
