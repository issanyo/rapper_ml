[Verse 1]
It's morning, 7 o'clock you at my clinic
It's me your orthopedic, gynecologyst
You looking pretty and fine, go ahead blow my mind
Girl what's wrong come here, let me take a look
You say you got burnt, your man should've wore a rubber
What type of partners you have and who's your first lover
He never turned you around, showed you doggystyle
We got some things in common, honey, let's talk awhile
Did he lick you there? Percolate your atmosphere?
I got a mask at home, boots, and some leather gear
How about me and you in black? I'm hittin' from the back
Tail in my face, and all juicy, brown booty
I'm the master, rubber splits, let me do my duty
Girl, let me touch you

[Hook: [?] + Dr. Octagon]
Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (Can ya tell me what's wrong?)
Girl, let me touch you there

Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (Can ya tell me what's wrong?)
Girl, let me touch you there
(Hey, baby)

[Verse 2]
Sipping Manischewitz smooth—your cute—drinking Hennessy
Jokin' 'bout two girls, your friend double-teamin' me
I got the office closed, you ready for the pros
Suckers ain't no good, sticking coke up in your nose
My style is wild at home and on the kitchen table
Porno-flicks in stacks, Playboy on the TV cable
I'd rather sign my address on your application
You can call late nights for lonely information
Where you come when it's boring? A place—where to go?
I want you in a two-piece, and freaky, for a private show
You got my number, address—you know the rest

[Hook: [?] + Dr. Octagon]
Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (You can tell me what's wrong)
Girl, let me touch you there

Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (You can tell me what's wrong)
Girl, let me touch you there

[Verse 3: Dr. Octagon + sample]
Only 18, bikini-body bad and mean
Do you have cards? In fact, I will take Medicaid
Your panties are wet—take it easy, don't sweat
You want some birth-control? You could smoke a cigarette
Relax, lay back, your buns feel good to smack
You think you're pregnant—your test show negative
I got a movie camera film that is positive
Turn around for me, girl, take a picture
This is the way with 24 flicks on Kodak
Them young boys ain't ready, so let me show them how to act
I put you in thongs and six-inch high shoes
You strut your stuff in latex, my strategy is rough
"I'll get smooth—"
"I'll get smooth—"
"I'll get smooth and f—" —Mmm—
"—your whole head up"

[Hook: [?] + Dr. Octagon]
Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (You can tell me what's wrong)
Girl, let me touch you there

Girl, let me touch you there
I wanna feel you (You can tell me what's wrong)
Girl, let me touch you there
