[Intro: Paul Banks]
The stars are bright
So let the wine flow
We'll soon cover the clouds
With crimson and coal
Dance all night
Show your lover the world
Cause with the sunrise
It’s ready to go
It’s ready to go
It’s ready to go
It’s ready to go
It’s ready to go

[Verse 1: RZA]
Banks and Steelz supremacy
Take it to extremities
Can't be poisoned by y'all noise and
We always got a remedy
Microphone is weaponry
Rappin skills legendary
Bust a nut, on these sluts
Only cause it’s necessary
Polo wearin, never sharin’
Top choice bitches I’ll be baggin
Undefeated, quite conceited
Many times y’all catch me braggin’
Ghetto motherfuckers walkin’ with our pants saggin’
Pioneer this brand
Yall up on my bandwagon
Fire breathing dragon disaster, microphone abusing
Makes my poison lyrics with street life, hip-hop infusing
Cruising in a Lamborghini
Sippin on a dry martini
Hood niggas saw me they thought
They saw a Lamborghini
My logo got carved inside your limestone
My mind has grown across five time zones
Bobby shake to the quake of a drum track
Make no mistake
After this you gonna jump back
Jump back, jump back nigga jump back
Got enough funk and skunk to fill a dump truck
Pump up your fists to this
Or you’ll get lumped up
Immaculate conception
You thought you had light but that was just my reflection
Uncircumcised thoughts I brake through protection
Sterilize mind I’m immune to infections
So nigga you burn before you turn
You churn
I don’t give a fuck what you earn
This is hip hop super sperm
Get em out
Get em out
Get em outta here
Banks & Steelz
Take em back
Take em back
Take em outta here
Banks & Steelz
Put your motherfucking hands up in the air
I said put your fucking hands in the air
Sword
Stone
Sword
Stone
Sword
Stone

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Samurai sword spitter
Bigger alternator
Detonator, orchestrater
The heats on the microwave
Darth Vader take a shave
Park up in the vallet
The phantom pull in Times Square
Get out with balleys
I take your girl inside
Checkers and the ralleys
They say she a stallion
The hat pumped with 40 gallons
They see me Ark 2
Parked up in park view
Lindrumming out
I can’t slouch, women see the muscles
The flexing on the couch
I’m Billy Rayon
Toyota squat low key gas station
Get gas
You see the Avalon, double minked up
I charge coats in Paragon
If she ball I tell her go sew her hair on
Stare on and drive out
The cat scratch your eyes out
I take my sword on board
The G4 and fly out
The rolls Royce decapitate em throw your head out
Mexican rydell you see the cartel
Helmets on the first team with the fox holes and triple beams
Magna Cartier watch
I’m tall as Chris Bosh
How you like your fitted
Movin, spin or wash
Sword
Stone
Sword
Stone

[Verse 3: RZA]
Polo wearing, never sharing, top choice bitches I be bagging
Let the music play slow down the gun play
Let you move for 6K
Destroy you in one day
With just words
Reverse the S and make a sword
I love myself
How can I stress a broad
I face everyday calamities
As calm as a swan on a pond
Rip 48 straight without a yawn
You trapped on g8 that's checkmate with a pawn
Bobby Steelz
Got his seed a swing on a lawn
And a pool in the back
I dreaded selling crack
I was good at flippin packs
Fiends kept coming back
Boostin leather bags from gucci
Cops kept me on my foot
I come to learn
I could earn more from one book
I bought one from Donald Passman
And I out-grossed my classmen
Hip hop music I love it with a passion
It ain’t nothing like hip hop music
We like it cause we choose it
Whether programs samples or acoustic
I got you in a puzzle cube like a rubiks
After sweating you'll be tired hot and wet cause you perspire
Banks & Steelz
Banks & Steelz
After sweating you'll be tired hot and wet cause you perspire
Banks & Steelz

Get em out
Get em out
Get em outta here
Banks & Steelz
Take em back
Take em back
Take em outta here
Banks & Steelz
Put your motherfucking hands up in the air
I said put your fucking hands in the air
Banks & Steelz
Sword Stone
Banks & Steelz
