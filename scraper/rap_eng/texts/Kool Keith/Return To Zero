[Intro]
Be the man on the street, he's around the corner, yeah!

Yeah, you don't have to play this on a Tuesday night
But check this out, this is Sunday morning in church!
With the brother, the Godfather
Open up the testaments, and let us read this
This ain't no flint stone and no bedrock type stuff, check it out

[Verse 1: Kool Keith]
Well I keep it styling, toe, on my jumping microphone
Big made my flow, show a rapper what I give 'em
No flex funky yo, take a honey step back
Watch when I come, you scratch that kitty cat on top of that
Rappers know I'm X, slow down, watch niggas stupid over
Dance with the ladies, I strip and chip 'em deals
Funky high[?], a technical, lyrics make 'em purer
With the brain dead spins, like kick a P, 33
Jump a 45 down, just like the first record rotate
My style, my rhyme, my game is dropping due to lyrics
Make the brothers and keep us out, damn I wanna hear it
Buy a copy tomorrow, kick his ol' tape
Take it back to town, to smack his girl, let him go
Tell his uncle, brother, aunt and cousin as well
As I rock so well, making tales, check the beat
My style is so early, you couldn't catch it on repeat
As I form and stretch, just like a rubber band, POP IT
Stopping every rapper like a trooper on a term pipe
I'm longer stronger just like the Lincoln tunnel
Father, big up, check it out
Back back, I switch switch, I check check, I know that
Born as I kick up, you're proud of me, you know it's me
I got more muscles to flex to show, than Joe Dusty
Take of them panties, I turn boys to men

[Verse 2: Godfather Don]
I'm wicked to the max, tax, corner blood from your sister
My wish 'em well 'cause I give 'em hell
Don't sell, so guess I miss 'em
Don't lead the charge, populating what I can create
I use 'em, my use 'em breaks, so you can take your beat and shove it
'Cause I love it when emcee ass predators try to get a metaphor
To make no-hits, show you it's too rough-kid
The super centrifugal, Don metaphysical, many time [?], your [?] where my rhyme goes
It's harder to find those, jazz breaks, keeps
Where he can listen it, from long time, no air from
Don't let me help you earn some
First you ought to have the skills to pay the bills
Make sure, it's real, don't cop-y my tech-nique
Don't try to steal, my deal piece
To papi, to amigo, school [?]
Yo IT, know the beat, bro achieve
Close the weed, [?] speak
Those ray peaks, shows they got left
Like tea though, they can't go where I go
I break 'em like chi, go
Stick pick, bitch, change the beat to a S
So you like the sound, you can't best [?]
Don't try to undress, my grey mannequins
'Cause like the madder B, I get better buzz
Bullet purple poison surfing, up a tempo
Tricky solo plexus, I cast a next and want no more [?]
Better blues and blacks, from the incredible, rap stack
Don't pass the lack a lack, lick a track attack
Battle babe, Ross's been thinking have a tad of that[?], yeah

Go east west, to make a damn champ and profile
Operate inf, I warm and call it no style
[?], [?], Select, then I play 'em
Electrocute an A when I slay 'em
I'm sticking to mad niggers who rob me of my style
I'm bucking 'em up in the face, and throwing them in the POW, yeah
