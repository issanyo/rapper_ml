[Intro- Dialogue: Tim Dog]
Awe yea
We about to rip this shit up correct
But before we do,I just want to say
That there is a lot of wack rappers out here
There's a lot of happy rappers out here
There's a lot of over commercial rappers out here
And me and my crew, we promise, as long as we get a chance to speak about it, we would
So I'm about to turn the mic over to my man Rhythm-X
Otherwise known as Kool Kieth
And he's about to get on the mother fucking mic
And say what the fuck he hates about this business
A yo Kieth, take it away...

[Verse One: Kool Kieth]
Yea, it's been a fucking long time
When Ultra was out fucking everybody knew me
Calling me, calling me
Bugging me, bugging me
But now they don't now
Because I don't have a hit out
With all this bullshit
This happy wack shit out
Suckers at the party, rappers stay jealous
Steady on my tip, while I'm hanging with the fellas
Walking through the Bronx and with my boots stomping
Very, very mad
Stupid, I ain't glad
Rappers have the money that I should of made and had
Watching this village bound hippy rap
These cartoon groups with that silly rap
Kicking those rhymes that say nothing
Promoted I was, I knew I wasn't
But watch out next time
Look for the X rhyme
This year, Dog
I ain't having it

[Kool Kieth ad lib]
Yo, I want all ya out there to suck my dick
Cause I came a long way, mother fuckers
And I want the next man to get up on the mic
And speak what the fuck he feels like

[Verse Two: Tim Dog]
Rap, it's a trade that won't quit
Every mother fucker want to make a hit
Using big words, using small words
Using no words, but that's absurd
But metaphor has yet to be done
Attempted by few, but stressed by none
Well I'm Dog and I'm here to say
That hardcore is here to stay
Look at all this pop rap, this happy rap, this wack ass rap
No more selling the fuck out
It's time to get the mother fucking hell out
And if I got to diss every MC
Huh, let it be
Why do you think every hardcore rapper doesn't get paid
But gets remade
And then he got to sell the fuck out just to make money
It ain't funny
There's a certain plot to the scheme
Killing the American dream
We can do what we want to do
Rap the way we want to rap
Whether your good or wack
But if the wack rappers got to get the mint
While I'm struggling to pay the rent
Fuck that shit I got to be a criminal
I'm telling you the message is subliminal
I'm not going out like that
Yea, I ain't having it

[Tim Dog ad lib]
Yea, I want all ya mother fuckers out there to kiss my ass
Cause y'all some wack mother fuckers, ya know
All you mother fuckers walking around, focusing on a gimmick
Wearing polka dots, putting dye in your hair, like you got it going on
Your shit is wack
I'll tell you to your face
I want you to know that rap is for real, rap is from the street, rap is nothing you can take it to a market and market it as a gimmick
Rap is nothing you can take it to arenas and sell it as a dancer
Rap is nothing you can put it in a movie with a bunch of turtles
Rap is some real hardcore shit and if you ain't dealing with rap
You ain't dealing with the streets
And if you ain't dealing with the streets, you ain't dealing with rap
And we wanna say, fuck you. And I'm out of here
