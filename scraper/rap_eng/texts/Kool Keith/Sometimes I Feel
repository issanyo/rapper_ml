[Intro]
Sometimes I feel
I feel certain ways
Sometimes I feel
Different types of ways

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel erotic and energetic
Athletic but mental sketches well rested, vibing it up
But now I sniffed up
I don't snip stuff
I just wake up and spit stuff
Out my head that makes me happy enough
Happy to grab the ball and stuff two points
In the basket
A tisket a tasket
That kid ain't all that
Ask him

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel a certain way

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like I'm seven foot thirteen with a mink
Green with lantern speed
I feel rap is my puppets on strings
Third string the weather make me intrigued
Overwhelmed I feel like I'm in the league
Riding a 20 Z that's just me bounding steadily
I'm mostly jolly
Just chilling on the couch probably
I'm Todd McFarland
No time for arguing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Many times it just feel like writing words that blend like herbal fragrances
I feel like polishing my cadences
The time and emotion is radiant
Sometime I feel like I'm leasing a spaceship
Not to flip, but to show the public what it is
Going on school trips with the kids
Exploring new inventions
I'm hypertension
Not to mention
Sometimes I feel a certain way
On a certain day

[Chorus]
