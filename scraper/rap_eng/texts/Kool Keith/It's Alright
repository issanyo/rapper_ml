[Chorus:]
It’s Alright
And you know it girl
I feel for you (I feel for you)
Your pretty eyes say a lot to me (say a lot to me)
They reflect to me
Your pretty hair grows so long
Down your back (down your back)
It makes me excited
Girly you know you could be my wife
And I’ll love you more for the rest of my life (my life) [echoes]

[Verse 1:]
Baby I’ll hold you tight and let you slide up my arms
Lick you from head to toey
I’m Lamar Odom
Put the magnum on for Khloe
The fantastic reality star
All my condoms lined up on the floor at the Skybar
Hollywood look up to me
I’m the sign tourist come miles around to see
Laughing at Britney’s house
Meagan Good’s perfume smell so sweet
Those panties she put on look petite
Ask Zoe Saldana in the kitchen for some clear wine
Her mother cooking meat
Tenderizing it in the oven
(Tenderize)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Extra cruising up sunset
The ladies meet for sushi and crackers
Their underwear start out real wet
S’how I feel downtown my jeweller polishing my baughettes
I bought lil’ Fluffy a $2000 puppy
For your singer female artist as a pet
She cry when I leave for tour
I get on the bus in my draws
I’m what all studios in the world can ignore
Chinese girls show me how to make shrimp rolls
We do not allow pimps to watch girls get Playboy centerfolds

[Chorus]
