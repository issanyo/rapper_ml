[Verse 1]
Yo
I used to check out lyrics upon the formats
Built with skill with technique, computer ADAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought, flow, acrobat
Sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions clubs like spores react by strobe visions
And hurrying more reflects on the dance floor
Blowing up, and having mad people showing up
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse while atmosphere continues
Sprinkle that
Win it like that, move it like that, hitting like that
The melody is phat
Yo, I'm on the energy source
The cosmic boss with Prodigy
Flipping astrology
My intellects devour
With diesel power

[Hook]
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)

[Verse 2]
Win, spin back, rewind, diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
It has to be, automatically
Check it out, you'd better work it out
Change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords to mics hanging like spring leaves
Doing tracks so fast, beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
Es and pepped up, you get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew's all cracked up
Check it, slow pitch, who's quick, you can't stick
My metaphor range is strange as angles
You get tangled
Twist inside affections
Channels repeat, complete, can't be beat
Check the hour texture
Mind adventure, exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
With diesel power

[Hook]
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)

[Verse 3]
Back attack the whack packs you faxing me
You don't want none, high quality action, be
Still standing, damaging your other manning
Quick reverse, potent as the first verse
My amplifier, blows on your world's higher
World sire, cuts like a barbed wire
Record player, I pull up on you everyday
Fast forward, I move and I swing toward
Exit load, put your brain in right mode
Select and mix
The man will perfect and fix
Heads lightly, bite me, copy, xerox, cock sand blocks
You can't knocks, I'm out there
Upbeat, lifting, shifting
Persistent intelligent kingpin
Peeping astrology, as I roll with Prodigy
With diesel power

[Hook]
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
(Blows your mind drastically, fantastically)
