[Hook: Tim Dog]
Yeah right, you said you bought that Lex last night right
You said you got sex last night right
You said you brought the Benz and your man got the ends and you got mad skills right
You said you bought a club last night right
You said you got a mill last night right
You just signed with Def Jam for ten million
Motherfucka stop lying

[Verse 1: Tim Dog]
Look, which nigga wanna fuck with us
Which nigga think he got big boxed enough
Which nigga think he pushing fat tracks than us
Can't fuck with us, we too luxurious
Luxurious, I'm serious
Stop playing motherfucka I'm curious
How you got a lot of game in a little bit of dough
Go up in the club sip a little bit or mo'

[Verse 2: Loudmouf Choir]
Chilling with the hoes, bitch fantastic
Tits is real, Clips is plastic
Hips is classic, face is plain
Bitch just say shit, Bitch ain't playing
Shit has changed, Shit is strange
Shit just hit you, it's insane
Fit the frame when I pose in the shots
I'm owned by my eagle, owned by my cock

[Hook: Tim Dog]

[Verse 3: Kool Keith]
Tim Dog, he say they falsified, still living
Yo they all lying, twenty-thirteen
They falsified, tuxedo in the club with the tie
Thank the lord you're alive people selling your music
The falsified, con artist, great promo
Mark alive, Jeremy lounge shoot them in the eyes
I'm like Kanye West I'm the best one left
See the gem confirm, Tim Dog is alive
A cornball made the rumor, the press said he died
ABC News calls, CBS News calls me
NBC News calls me, magazines all call me, It's falsified
